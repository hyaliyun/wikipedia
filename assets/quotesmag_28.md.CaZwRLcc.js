In 2012, Greig began co-hosting the Hot30 Countdown show on 2Day FM with Matty Acton, who was later replaced by Mike Christian. Royal prank In December 2012, Greig and Christian broadcast a prank call they had made to King Edward VII Hospital, where Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge was staying, posing as the Queen and Prince Charles. It later transpired that one of the nurses who answered the call, Jacintha Saldanha, as a result of being duped by the DJs and the subsequent media attention, later committed suicide. Greig made a statement at the inquest, while 2Day FM has, to date, rejected any blame for Ms Saldanha's death. The show was then cancelled on 12 December. Greig has since complained on ITV's This Morning that she was the victim of a 'witch hunt'. Post radio show In 2015, Greig was a contestant on the fourth season of The Celebrity Apprentice Australia. She was fired after Task 8. In January 2016, Greig began co-hosting the 96.5 Wave FM breakfast show, The Hot Breakfast, with Travis Winks.

Formed in 2006 by American rapper Ori Murray and English guitarist/songwriter Brad Rubinstein, the band released their debut album, Infinity, in Israel in 2010 and in the United States through Shemspeed Records in 2012. They have received considerable media attention, much of it focused on the contrast between their traditional Jewish dress and modern-sounding music. A second recording, Boss EP, was released through the band's own Heatseat Records in December 2012. In 2015, they were announced as contestants on the Israeli reality singing show HaKokhav HaBa.  History  Founding members Ori Murray and Brad Rubinstein met at the Aish HaTorah yeshiva in Jerusalem, after having led largely non-religious lives. Upon discovering that they both had musical backgrounds they had abandoned in favor of their religious studies (Murray had previously been an MC in Seattle's drum and bass scene, while Rubinstein had been the guitarist and songwriter for a short- lived Essex-based trip hop outfit called Lisp), the two started encouraging each other to return to making music and ultimately formed Shtar in 2006, taking the name from a tractate of Gemara they were learning at the time. Originally a duo, they gradually added a full band to their lineup in order to be more interesting live. In May 2010, the band released its debut album Infinity. The band was signed a year later by Shemspeed Records, who re- released the album on March 5, 2012. In October, the band played the Israeli independent music festival InDNegev and gave a Halloween concert at Mike's Place in Tel Aviv. December 5, 2012 saw the independent release of a second Shtar recording, the Boss EP. Shortly afterward, the band announced plans for a second EP, Beauty Queen EP, to be released in early summer 2013, as well as a UK tour the same year. On April 9, 2014, Shtar released a Prince of Egypt- inspired Passover single called \\"So Decide\\". On December 10 of the same year, they released a Hanukkah single, \\"Lights\\", through Aish.com. The band auditioned for the 2015-16 season of the Israeli reality singing competition HaKokhav HaBa, which offers winners a spot in the Eurovision Song Contest. Their audition song was a cover of \\"In the End\\" by Linkin Park. They were awarded ninth place, while singer Hovi Star was declared the winner with \\"Made of Stars\\".  Musical style  Over the course of their career, Shtar's music has combined hip hop with elements of funk, rock, pop, electronica, and Sephardic music (co-vocalist Dan Isaac comes from a line of Sephardic cantors), with influences including Beck, The Roots, Massive Attack, Mos Def, and Coldplay.Shtar YNet News Interview, originally conducted by Rafi Barbiro for Ynet News, later posted on the band's YouTube channel. Max Elstein Keisler of The Forward described the formula of the songs on Infinity as \\"a melodic, live-band beat, a smooth vocal hook, usually in Hebrew, and a sophisticated 'smart guy' rapping.\\" In contrast, the Boss EP included more pop and electronica elements, and featured completely English lyrics and less overtly religious themes.

The term is used interchangeably with biomedical device connectivity or biomedical device integration. By eliminating the need for manual data entry, potential benefits include faster and more frequent data updates, diminished human error, and improved workflow efficiency. Medical devices may be connected on wireless and wired networks. Wireless networks, including Wi-Fi, Wireless Medical Telemetry Service, and Bluetooth, provide more ubiquitous coverage of connectivity, allowing uninterrupted monitoring of patients in transit. Wired networks are fast, stable, and highly available. Wired networks are usually more costly to install at first and require ongoing costs for maintenance, but allow connectivity of the organization in a closed environment. Interoperability of Devices Adherence to Standards ensures interoperability within a network of medical devices. In most cases, the clinical environment is heterogenous; devices are supplied by a variety of vendors, allowing for different technologies to be utilized. Achieving interoperability can be difficult, as data format and encryption varies among vendors and models.Day, B., (2011). Standards for medical device interoperability and integration. Patient Safety & Quality Healthcare, Jan/Feb. Retrieved from The following standards enable interoperability between connected medical device. *CEN ISO/IEEE 11073* enables the communication between medical devices and external information systems. This standard provides plug-and-play interoperability between devices, and facilitates the efficient exchange of data acquired at the point of care in all care environments. *IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n are standards for implementing a wireless local area network (WLAN) in 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands, utilizing the same basic protocol. Regulatory organizations and industrial associations, such as Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) initiative and Continua Health Alliance, are working towards standardized vendor-neutral device integration systems. The IHE provides a single set of internationally harmonized medical device informatics and interoperability standards as a unitary reference point for the industry. The IHE collaborates with Continua Health Alliance regarding data exchange protocol and device specializations. The IHE Patient Care Device (PCD) Technical Framework Volumes 1-3 defines the established standards profiles, such as the integration, transaction and semantic content profiles respectively for complete, enterprise-wide integration and interoperability of health information systems.IHE International.

Medical Device Integration Software  Hospitals have many different makes and models of medical devices. Each department has different types of devices, and rarely does an entire hospital run the same brand device. Because of the large number of devices, and the varying formats that data is exchanged (RS-232, HL7, Bluetooth, WiFi), Medical Device Integration software has become a critical component to integrating this vital patient data. Software such as MediCollector, Picis Hawkeye or ENOVACOM Patient Connect connects with virtually any device via HL7, Serial (RS-232), Bluetooth, WiFi, etc., and shares this data to any other software platform across a hospital network. This allows hospitals to continue to use their older devices, in a more modern network. Positive Patient Identification and Connectivity Patient confidentiality can be compromised when the device data is transmitted to the wrong electronic health record. A positive patient identification at the point of care can be ensured through bar-code identifiers and radiofrequency identifiers. *Bar-code Identification - Patient data is encoded within a bar-code on the patient's identification bracelet. Device identifying data is encoded within a bar-code attached to the device. Scanning the patient bar-code in conjunction with the medical device bar-code, ensures a patient-device association. *Radiofrequency Identification - Patient and device identifying information is encoded within an RFID tag. This information is detected, and the clinician is prompted to confirm the patient-device association. RFID is a more efficient method of positive patient identification when there are multiple devices in use. Security Issues in Medical Device Connectivity Security issues may arise in medical networking for many reasons. The following is a list of security challenges particular to medical devices: * Medical devices often operate with commercial central processing units, operating systems, or off-the-shelf software, which place them at risk of cyber threat. * Due to tight regulations surrounding medical devices, upgrades to software and security installations must be approved by the manufacturer, resulting in delays. * Device operating systems are often early generation and may no longer be supported. * Homogenous device environments facilitate rapid spread of computer virus. * Devices may have limited memory, necessitating the use of scaled back versions of operating systems, making it more difficult to utilize common security software.

The Texas A&M; team recovered more than 74,000 pieces of debitage and more than 1,300 artifacts, the majority of which originated from Clovis. These included fluted projectile points, bifaces, blade cores, blades, core tablets, end scrapers, and other tools. At this site geoarchaeological methods uncovered a complex stratigraphy of channel, bar, and floodplain sediments and buried paleosols,\\"The North Star Archaeological Research Program.\\" Center for the Study of the First Americans.

The Clovis artifacts were localized at the base of the sequence with Folsom, Late Paleo-Indian and Archaic artifacts in superimposing deposits. The Manis Mastodon Site in Washington was originally excavated by Carl Gustavson in 1973; although no separate stone tools were found, one rib of the mastodon had an embedded bone projectile point. Gustavson dated the remains to around 14,000 years ago, but the evidence from this site has been disputed for many years. Waters and the North Star team reanalyzed the rib using modern technologies such as advanced AMS radiocarbon dating, high resolution X-ray CT imaging, and DNA and protein sequencing.Waters, M. R., Stafford, T. W., McDonald, H. G., Gustafson, C., Rasmussen, M., Cappellini, E., Olsen, J. V., Szklarczyk, D., Jensen, L. J., Gilbert, M. T.

They were able to determine that the object lodged in the mastodon‚Äôs rib is a bone projectile point and the site is indeed around 14,000 years old. This site provides evidence that mastodon hunting by pre-Clovis peoples was occurring at the end of the Ice Age. In 2007, Waters published a paper with Thomas Stafford re-dating many of the key Clovis sites in North America to between 13,000 and 12,700 years ago.  Awards and honors  In 1977, Waters was awarded the Evans B. Mayo award from the University of Arizona for outstanding performance in field geology.

She worked in the genres of landscapes and genre paintings using in watercolor and tempera. She also worked created embroidery and applique. She was a participant of the Russian apostolate in Diaspora. Biography Brailovskaya was daughter of a general. In 1898 she married the artist Leonid Brailovsky, who lived in Moscow. Known as an independent artist, she participated together with her husband in the implementation of joint projects. In 1900 she taught art at Stroganov Moscow State University of Arts and Industry. In 1918 the Brailovsky family emigrated, first to Constantinople and then to Belgrade; from 1925 they were settled in Rome. Conversion to Catholicism Brailovskaya and her husband were Russian Orthodoxes and more later joined to Catholic Church. The couple were close to the bishops Michel d'Herbigny, Alexander Evreinov and Andrei Katkov. In 1933 she participated in the creation of the Museum of Russian religious art at the Congregation for the Oriental Churches in the Vatican, where they exposed Brailovsky's paintings from the series \\"Visions of Old Russia.\\" From 1920 to 1940, her paintings were exhibited in Russicum, where she taught Russian language, this time talking with the poet Vyacheslav Ivanov, Archpriest Alexander Sipiagin and Tatyana Sukhotina-Tolstaya.

The salts do not fit in the crystal structure of water ice, so the salt is expelled. Since the oceans are salty, this process is important in nature. Salt rejected by the forming sea ice drains into the surrounding seawater, creating saltier, denser brine. The denser brine sinks, influencing ocean circulation. Formation Average salinity of sea ice as a function of ice thickness for cold sea ice sampled during the growth season. The standard error of the estimate is 1.5‚Ä∞ for thin ice and 0.6‚Ä∞ for thick ice. As water reaches the temperature where it begins to crystallize and form ice, salt ions are rejected from the lattices within the ice and either forced out into the surrounding water, or trapped among the ice crystals in pockets called brine cells. Generally, sea ice has a salinity ranging from 0 psu at the surface to 4 psu at the base. The faster that this freezing process occurs, the more brine cells are left in the ice. Once the ice reaches a critical thickness, roughly 15 cm, the concentration of salt ions in the liquid around the ice begins to increase, as leftover brine is rejected from the cells. This increase is associated with the appearance of strong convective plumes, which flow from channels and within the ice and carry a significant salt flux. The brine that drains from the newly formed ice is replaced by a weak flow of relatively fresh water, from the liquid region below it. The new water partially freezes within the pores of the ice, increasing the solidity of the ice. As sea ice ages and thickens, the initial salinity of the ice decreases due to the rejection of brine over time [Fig. 2]. While the sea ice ages, desalinization occurs to such a degree that some multiyear ice has a salinity of less than 1 PSU.Talley L.D., Pickard G.L., Emery W.J., Swift J.H., 2011. Descriptive Physical Oceanography: An Introduction (Sixth Edition), Elsevier, Boston, 560 pp. This occurs in three different ways: *solute diffusion - this depends on the fact that brine inclusions trapped in ice will begin to migrate toward the warmer end of the ice block. The ice block is warmest at the water- ice interface, thus pushing the brine out into the water surrounding the ice. *gravity drainage - Gravity drainage involves the movement of brine due to differences in density between brine in the interior of the ice and brine in the seawater outside of the ice, which occurs due to the development of a buoyancy driven convection system.Wettlaufer J.S., Worster M.G., Huppert H.E. (1997). Natural convection during solidification of an alloy from above with application to evolution of sea ice. J. Fluid. Mech. 344 291-316. *expulsion - the migration of brine due to cracking produced by thermal expansion of the ice, or pressure caused by the increased volume of the newly formed ice. Role in deep water formation and the thermohaline circulation Arctic and Antarctic sea ice concentration climatology from 1981-2010, at the approximate seasonal maximum and minimum levels based on passive microwave satellite data. Brine rejection occurs in the sea ice packs around at the north and south poles of the earth [Fig. 3]. The Arctic Ocean has historically ranged from roughly 14-16 million square kilometers in late winter to roughly 7 million square kilometers each September. The annual increase of ice plays a major role in the movement of ocean circulation and deep water formation. The density of the water below the newly formed ice increases due to the brine rejection. Saltier water can also become colder without freezing. The dense waters that form in the Arctic are called North Atlantic Deep Waters (NADW), while the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) forms in the southern hemisphere. These two areas of brine rejection play an important role in the thermohaline circulation of all of earth's oceans. Brinicles As sea ice freezes, it rejects increasingly salty water, which drains through narrow brine channels that thread through the ice. The brine flowing through the brine channels and out of the bottom of the ice is very cold and salty, so it sinks in the warmer, fresher seawater under the ice, forming a plume. The plume is colder than the freezing point of sea water under the ice, so the seawater can freeze where it touches the plume. Ice freezing around the edges of the plume gradually builds a hollow icicle-like tube, called a brinicle. These frozen stalactite-like forms are fragile during early stages, but if brine drainage ceases, they may freeze solid. In calm waters, brinicles can reach the sea floor, freezing it fairly abruptly. Climate change The deep ocean basins are stably stratified, so mixing of surface waters with the deep ocean waters occurs only very slowly. The dissolved CO2 of the surface waters of the ocean is roughly in equilibrium with the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere. As atmospheric CO2 levels are rising, the oceans are absorbing some CO2 from the atmosphere. When surface waters sink, they carry considerable amounts of CO2 into the deep oceans, away from the atmosphere. Because these waters are able to contain a large amount of CO2, they have helped slow the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, thus slowing some aspects of climate change. Climate change could have different effects on ice melt and brine rejection. Previous studies have suggested that as ice cover thins, it will become a weaker insulator, resulting in larger ice production during the autumn and winter.Holland M.M., Bitz C., Tremblay B. (2006), Future abrupt reductions in the summer Arctic sea ice. Geophys. Res. Letters. 33, 1-5. The consequent increase in winter brine rejection will drive ocean ventilation, and strengthen the inflow of warm Atlantic waters. Studies of the last glacial maximum (LGM) have indicated that a drastic reduction in the production of sea ice and thus reduction of brine rejection, would result in the weakening of the stratification in the global deep oceans and in CO2 release into the shallow oceans and the atmosphere, triggering global deglaciation. Life in channels and surrounding waters Life in sea ice is energetically demanding, and sets limits at any hierarchical organizational, and organismic level, ranging from molecules to everything that an organism does. Despite this fact, the brine-containing interstices and pockets found in sea ice host a variety of organisms, including bacteria, autotrophic and heterotrophic protists, microalgae, and metazoa.Giannelli V., Thomas D. N., Haas C., Kattner G., Kennedy H., Dieckmann G.S. (2001), Behaviour of dissolved organic matter and inorganic nutrients during experimental sea-ice formation, Ann. Glaciology. 33, 317-321.

The story is told in third person narrative, and is part of a larger group of published work in her book of short stories, \\"Papeles de Pandora\\", this is one of the most famous of those short stories. Ferr√© managed to produce this work in both Spanish and English, originally published in Spanish in 1972 in the journal Zona de Carga y descarga; the journal in which the story was initially published was created by Ferr√© and her cousin Olga Nolla. Before Ferr√© translated this short story, it was translated by US translator Gregory Rabassain in 1980, yet his translation did not meet Ferr√©'s vision of the work. Ferr√© worked to retranslate it with her friend, Diana V√©lez, this work of theirs was published in 1991. With the multiple translations of this short story, it separated her from other Latin American writers who primarily wrote their work in Spanish. It is considered an important work of Puerto Rican literature and important in Women's studies.  Background  For many Puerto Rican authors, they wrote in Spanish as a way to stay connected to their heritage. For Ferr√© she began to write most of her work, primarily in English from 1995, this is after over two decades of writing most of her work in Spanish. Among other differences of writers during this time, Ferr√© focused on undermining the \\"classist, racist and sexist underpinnings\\" in regard to those who were part of the elite in Puerto Rico, aiming towards the base of feminism and the females sexuality. Countering the ideals which had been embedded into her society of the time was a way in which she showed her feminist outlook on situations. This follows with the journal she created with her cousin Olga Nolla, Zona de carga y descarga, this journal dealt with issues revolving around \\"identity, marginality, independence, class, ethnicity, feminism, gender and nation\\" Not only did the journal signify what was going on in Puerto Rico at the time, but the influence the story had on each issue. There is also a given metaphor for the conflicts among classes, specifically between the gentry and businessmen, that was occurring during the time when it was written. With knowledge of what was occurring within Puerto Rico at the time, the work in itself was a fictional reimaging of what could be expected within conflict. Ch√°gara Atya lanipes, a crustacean (freshwater shrimp), \\"chagara\\" might refer to other species A ch√°gara, found in Puerto Rico and other Caribbean Islands, is a type of edible crustacean: shrimp, prawn or crayfish, fished from rivers and freshwater streams by locals. In the story's many analysis the ch√°gara is called different things, sometimes a river prawn.  Feminism  Palaemon Jamaiciensis, Species of fresh water Prawn within West Indies. Possibly within the same family as the Ch√°gara. It is important to note Ferr√©'s idea of how masculine and feminine writing have the possibility of showing similar aspects when it comes to the themes within the story, specifically noting how she perceived the feminine viewpoint as being \\"subversive and daring\\". This specific to the ways in which society has come to view dolls as being nothing but innocent, yet within this story they are portrayed differently, this is the result of male writers suppressing women's roles within society. The story in itself changes the way in which the traditional woman may be fetished, it gives the story its own power to counteract how women are objectified within the arts. Literary significance and reception The story falls under the genre of magical realism. According to critic Cynthia Sloan, \\"One of the lucid strategies that Ferr√© employs to challenge the conventional misrepresentation is to introduce the presence of dolls in the literal, as well as the figurative sense, to show how the doll, being the stereotypical choice of toy for a girl, encapsulates societal expectations of behavior and appearance and therefore limits the scope of possibilities for women by continually reinforcing unrealistic ideals\\". The text also reflects the weakening of landowners as a result of industrialization. According to critic Mervin Rom√° Capeles, the aunt feels humiliated and sacrificed by a powerful man as he pursues his ambitions; a doctor who has so morbidly chosen to not treat her wound, has instead kept her as his permanent patient because of her wealth. When one walks into the room where the aunt and her dolls reside, their room resembles a dovecote, symbolizing freedom lost and the room also looks like a warehouse where tobacco leaves have been left to ripen, symbolizing stagnation. The aunt's wound continues to fester and smells like a ripened guanabana, a fruit. These represent the interior of the aunt, whose growth was stunted from the moment the ch√°gara bore into her leg. The aunt has renounced all her dreams of marriage, and her sexuality has been castrated. The last niece is now subjugated by her husband. The doll, a duplicate of that last niece, the aunt and the niece seem to merge into one, a supernatural being with empty eyes from which crayfish emerge. We can see the similarity through the youngest niece and how she is a representation of the aunt who has been transformed into a separate identity which is the doll. Two authors, Mar√≠a Negroni and Maria Caballero believe the tale has to do with vengeance. The young doctor who marries the last niece realizes that he has aged but his wife has not. This is after he had flaunted her as a beautiful possession to prove his importance in society. The doll, which he mutilated when he removed its diamond eyes, had been a wedding gift given to his wife by her aunt. Later in the tale, the doll exacts its revenge by \\"coming to life\\" and spilling ch√°garas from her eyes. Plot As a young woman, \\"la t√≠a\\" (\\"the aunt\\"), would often bathe in the river. One such day, she has an accident while swimming in which she is bitten on the calf by a ch√°gara, a river prawn. A doctor inspects her wound and determines that the ch√°gara has nested inside the calf wound. The wound does not heal and her leg becomes swollen and enlarged, and the doctor continues to provide treatment for her. As the years go by, the aunt, though beautiful and wealthy, is ashamed of her disfigured leg and abandons the prospect of marriage, instead focusing on raising her nine nieces.The nieces and the aunt were very close, so much as she brought them up as if they were her daughters.Whenever the nieces were around the aunt, they would try to lift up her skirt slightly because the wound in which the river prawn was nested gave off a sweet smell. For each of their birthdays, she creates a doll for each one of them, and over the years, perfects the dolls to resemble each niece.When the aunt first started making the dolls they were made of basic materials, eventually leading up to porcelain and finer materials. The glass eyes that were to be put into the doll were always submerged into the river so that they \\"recognized the slightest stirring of the prawns antennae\\". The dolls were sized up to the daughters each year so that the heights and measurements were similar. As each niece grows and is sent off to get married, the aunt creates one last doll for each and states, in , \\"Here is your Easter Sunday\\". As the doctor continues to treat the aunt over the years, he brings his son, who is also studying to become a doctor. His son examines her leg and later, tells his father that her leg could have been cured long ago. However, his father reveals to him that by exploiting the aunt's wealth for his regular visits, he was able to pay for his son's education, telling his son that \\"I wanted you to see the prawn that has paid for your education these twenty years.\\" The doctor retires, and his son becomes the aunt's new physician, continuing to exploit her condition for his gain. Eventually, the young doctor asks the youngest niece for her hand in marriage, and she accepts. The doll that is made for the youngest niece is made of porcelain, honey, and has diamond \\"eardrops\\" for eyes. For the last time, the aunt sends them off saying, \\"Here is your Easter Sunday.\\" Once married, the young doctor immediately moves his wife, the youngest niece, to an ugly concrete building, a strong contrast from the luxury she has known. The doll is placed in their new home on top of the piano. The young doctor orders his new wife to sit on the balcony, as evidence for all to see that he married into high society.Over the years the doctor becomes a millionaire, thanks to his wife, for his clients see him just so that they could see the last of the sugarcane aristocracy. After some time, as the youngest niece remains on the balcony, the young doctor decides to sell the doll's diamond eyes. He scrapes them out of the doll's face and buys himself a pocket watch. The doll and the youngest niece close their eyes on that day. One day, the young doctor desires to sell the doll's porcelain skin, and sees that the doll is missing and his wife explains that ants must have found it and eaten it, given that it was filled with honey. Over time, the doctor observes that his wife does not age as he has over the years. One night, he checks on her and sees that her chest does not rise and fall as it would if someone were breathing. Listening into her chest, he can hear the sound of the river within her. Her eyelids then open to reveal lifeless eyes, from which begin to emerge the antennas of angry ch√°garas.Ferr√©, Rosario. \\"La mu√±eca menor.\\" Voces de Hispanoam√©rica: Antolog√≠a Literaria.

The filly's entire racing career consisted of one run in 1815 followed by three races in the space of thirteen days in June 1816. After winning the Oaks on her second racecourse appearance, she finished first and second in races at Ascot. Already pregnant at the time of her classic success, Landscape was retired from racing after Ascot and produced her first foal in the following spring. Background Landscape was a bay mare bred by her owner General John Leveson Gower who had won the Oaks with Maid of Orleans in 1809. Her sire, Rubens was a successful racehorse, who at the time of Landscape's conception was covering mares at Wheeler's Farm near Wokingham in Berkshire at a fee of 15 guineas. He sired two other classic winning fillies in Pastille, who won the 2000 Guineas and Oaks in 1816 and Whizgig, who won the 1000 Guineas in the same year. Rubens was champion sire in 1815, 1821 and 1822. Landscape's dam Housemaid (also known as Iris) produced several other good winners including Raphael, who finished second to Whisker in the 1815 Epsom Derby and Rainbow, who became a successful stallion in France. Racing career 1815: two-year-old season Until 1913 there was no requirement for British racehorses to have official names (two-year-olds were allowed to race unnamed until 1946). On her only run as a two-year-old, \\"Gen. L. Gower's b. f. sister to Raphael\\" ran in the July Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 10 July. She was not among the favourites and finished unplaced behind the Duke of Rutland's filly Belvoirina. 1816: three-year-old season The General's filly had been officially named Landscape when she made her three-year-old debut in the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom on 1 June. The race attracted eleven runners from an original entry of forty-eight, and despite her lack of previous experience, General Gower's filly was made 2/1 favourite. The next horses in the betting were Duenna, Guendolen and Rhoda, the fillies who had finished second, third and first respectively in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket a month earlier. Ridden by Sam Chifney, Jr., Landscape won the 1425 Guinea prize from Duenna, with Mr Walker's unnamed filly taking third place. Landscape's two remaining races came at Ascot Racecourse less than two weeks later. On 11 June she was entered in a 600 guinea sweepstakes over the New Mile Course in which she started odds on favourite and won from Ginger Sal, the only horse who appeared to oppose her. Two days later she contested another sweepstakes over the same course and distance in which, as the winner of the Oaks, she was required to carry a seven pound weight penalty. She started favourite but finished second of the four runners behind Duenna. General Gower died later that year and Landscape was sold to Lord Lowther. Stud record Landscape had been covered by the stallion Woful as a three- year-old and was retired from racing to become a broodmare at the end of the year. In the following spring she produced her first foal, a filly named Perspective (later known as Katherina). She produced a further fourteen foals for a variety of owners before her death in 1834. Katherina became a successful broodmare, being the dam of Rowton who won the St Leger Stakes in 1829 and later became a successful sire in Virginia.

Holliday (born September 14, 1976) is an American college baseball coach and former professional player in Minor League Baseball. Currently the head coach of the Oklahoma State Cowboys baseball team, he was hired to this position prior to the 2013 season. In 2014, Holliday was the Big 12 Conference Baseball Coach of the Year as OSU claimed the conference regular season championship. Holliday's Cowboys pulled OSU a little Cowboy baseball tradition out of the fire and faced Oklahoma on the final weekend of 2017. The team was in danger of missing out of the postseason for the 1st time in Holliday's tenure at Oklahoma State. The Cowboys swept the instate rival Oklahoma Sooners (#2 seed going into region play) to claim the last and final spot as the 8th seed in the BigXII Championship. The Cowboys went back to their tradition and won just the 2nd Big 12 tournament in schools rich baseball history. The Cowboys won 16 straight Big 8 tournaments before the formation of the Big12. The Cowboys became the 1st eight seed (last seed) to win the conference championship and by doing so Holliday got his team in the NCAA postseason for the 5th time in his 5 years at the school. The season was full of injuries from top to bottom. Holliday and his associated head coach and current (2016) assistant coach of the year Rob Walton put together a pitching staff that was nothing short of magical. The Cowboys luck would run out as they were sent to the Arkansas Regional and went 0-2 losing game one to Regional champions Missouri State Bears on a two out bottom of the 9th walk off HR. Garrett Benge hit for the cycle for Holliday's Cowboys but it wasn't enough. Garrett McCain would be named 1st team all-American, the 25th in Cowboys history. He would one of five current Cowboys drafted in 2017, preceded by 11 from the 2016 College World Series club, giving Holliday 16 in 2 years. The Cowboys went on an end of the year run that had seen them lose six games in a row and face being the first Oklahoma State team to finish under .500 in 40 years. The Cowboys finished 30‚Äì27 on the year. A 6‚Äì5 victory over the Texas Longhorns would be Holliday's 200th victory as the head coach of Oklahoma State. Before becoming head coach of the Cowboys, Holliday played college baseball for OSU while attending as a student. He was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in 1999, for whom he played two seasons in the minor leagues. He then returned to his alma mater as an assistant coach and subsequently coached as an assistant for NC State, Georgia Tech, Arizona State and Vanderbilt. College playing career The Minnesota Twins drafted Holliday in the 14th round after high school in 1995, but he did not sign. He instead attended Oklahoma State University (OSU) and played college baseball there for the Cowboys. He earned four varsity letters at OSU while playing in 256 games, second all-time with the Cowboys. He ranks highly in many statistical categories among Cowboy greats, placing seventh in home runs (HR) with 53, first in walks (BB) with 225, and in the top five in runs, hits, doubles, total bases, runs batted in (RBI), and hit by pitches. Minor league career (1999‚Äì2000) After his college career, Holliday was drafted for a second time. The Toronto Blue Jays selected him in the ninth round of the 1999 amateur draft. He played for two seasons in Minor League Baseball in the Toronto organization. A versatile player, he frequently played first base and catcher, and also appeared at third base, right field and left field. In 1999 with the Class A short-season St. Catharines Stompers, Holliday produced a .902 on-base plus slugging (OPS) in 71 games. He batted .255, but managed to score 50 runs due in part to drawing 63 walks for a .439 on-base percentage. He also hit 13 doubles and 10 home runs for a .463 slugging percentage. The next season with the Class A Hagerstown Suns, his batting average slipped to .220 in 74 games, but his 52 BB placed his OBP at .381 and he scored 46 runs. His OBP in those two season was .410 in spite of a combined .237 batting average. Coaching career (2001‚Äìpresent) Prior to the 2001 season, Holliday returned to Stillwater to become a student assistant coach under his father, head coach Tom Holliday. He became a full-time staff member the following season and served for two years. Holliday spent the 2004 season at NC State, who made an NCAA Tournament appearance. Following his single season in Raleigh, Holliday was hired as an assistant at ACC rival Georgia Tech, who reached the 2006 College World Series, won the 2005 ACC Tournament, and were among the nation's elite in several offensive categories. Holliday was named to the staff of Arizona State beginning in 2008. During his tenure, the Sun Devils signed the nation's top recruiting class and appeared in the 2009 College World Series. For his efforts, Vanderbilt named him recruiting coordinator and assistant coach in 2010. The Commodores made a run to the College World Series with Holliday on the staff. It was the program's first College World Series appearance.http://www.vanderbilt.edu/magazines/vanderbilt- magazine/2011/09/the-dores-of-summer/ As recruiting coordinator at Vanderbilt, Holliday helped assemble a roster that would set a SEC record for regular season conference wins with a 26‚Äì3 record in 2013, his first year as head coach in Stillwater. On June 8, 2012, Holliday was named head coach of the Oklahoma State Cowboys, returning to his childhood home to lead the program for which he played. He is the first head coach at OSU who also played for the Cowboys. Head coaching records Below is a table of Holliday's yearly records as an NCAA head baseball coach. Family Josh's father was an assistant coach at Oklahoma State while Josh grew up and while he played at Oklahoma State. The elder Holliday later served as head coach while Josh was an assistant.

The family eventually provided successive imperial portraitists in the following years. Family members such as Sebuh Manas (1816‚Äì1889), a brother of Rupen, and another Manas named Jozef (1835‚Äì1916) both served as imperial artists during the reigns of Mahmud II (1808‚Äì1839), Abdulmecid I (1839‚Äì1861), Abdulaziz (1861‚Äì1876) and Abdulhamit II (1876‚Äì1909). Since the brothers were assigned to the Ottoman Embassy in Paris, their portraits were distributed to other embassies throughout Europe.  Rafael and Manas  Rafael Manas (1710‚Äì1780) is the first member of the family to be known.

He was the chief interpreter of the Ottoman Embassy in Paris in 1847. He received a Mecidiye medal in 1854. Sultan Mahmut II sent Rupen Manas to Paris for training in art. He had his own portrait done in oils and then had it displayed at the Sublime Porte.  Sebuh  The second son of Zenop, Sebuh Manas (1816‚Äì1889) was also sent to Paris by Mahmud II (much like his brother Rupen) to attain art training. In 1858 he was working in the Ottoman embassy in Turin, where he remained for nearly 30 years. Sebuh Manas became the chief portraitist for Abdulmecid and Abdulaziz. He received a Mecidiye medal in 1855, a year after his brother Rupen received one.  Jozef  Considered the last court painter of the family, Jozef was born in 1835 and died in 1916. He is the son of Zenop Manas's brother Mgirdic. During the reign of Abdulmecid I, Jozef received education in Europe and took the place of Sebuh. One of the most important works of Jozef has been the miniature portrait of the last German Empress and Prussian Queen Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein. Also among considerable significance is his oil painting of Deli Fuad Pasha.  Edgar  Edgar Manas was born on April 12, 1875 in Istanbul.

Yet, his impulse to continue his music studies took him back to Italy, where he settled in Padua and worked with composer Luigi Bottazzo, focusing on harmony, counterpoint and fugue. Back in Constantinople, Manas pursued his music studies further. He concentrated primarily on composition by examining the classics and the works of contemporary French masters.

Regular contributions to a common fund entitled the society member to relief under prescribed circumstances thereby preserving that member‚Äôs respectability in the face of calamity. The rise in the price of flour during the Napoleonic Wars led many Friendly Societies to form \\"Flour clubs\\" which purchased and ground wheat for members, selling it to them at prime cost; and by 1800, an increasingly large number were collectively erecting their own mills to grind grain at cost. One of the largest was the Birmingham Union Mill, a three-storey mill built in 1797. Like these English examples, the Farmers‚Äô Storehouse was organized on a joint stock basis to engage in trade on behalf of the poor; they were early co-operatives. These co-operative ventures were increasingly organized under the banner of Owenite socialism during the 1820s.  Organization  Sharon Temple National Historic Site After the Napoleonic Wars, as industrial production in Britain took off, English manufacturers began dumping cheap goods in Montreal; this allowed an increasing number of shopkeepers in York (Toronto) to obtain their goods competitively from Montreal wholesalers. With the consolidation of both the flour and wholesale trades in Montreal, a group of Home District millers and farmers formed the Farmers‚Äô Storehouse Company, to circumvent the control of these new Toronto merchants. The company petitioned the Lt. Governor for a \\"water lot\\" on the beach on which to build the storehouse; they received the lot where the St. Lawrence market building now stands (and immediately south of the original market buildings). They built a warehouse 100 feet long by 20 ft. wide, and 20 ft. high. The first president of the Company was Joseph Shepard, a prominent Reform organizer with close ties to William Lyon Mackenzie. The company had 5 board members, a $3000 capitalization, and was operated by a store-keeper. The Farmers' Storehouse was both a producers and consumer cooperative. Farmers sold their wheat and flour through the company and purchased their needs from its store. They could also obtain small loans equal to the share capital they held. Management of the Company soon passed to Samuel Hughes, a member of the Children of Peace, a religious group who lived in the village of Hope, East Gwillimbury township. The Children of Peace had just established a credit union within the group, and under their leadership, the Farmers' Storehouse company also tried to establish itself as a bank. It was widely emulated throughout the province by the \\"Newcastle District Accommodation Company\\" (near Peterborough) and the \\"Bath Freeholders‚Äô Bank\\" (near Kingston).  Politics  Both presidents of the Farmers's Storehouse Company, Joseph Shepard and Samuel Hughes, were prominent Reform organizers north of Toronto. The cooperative movement was politicized due to the obstruction of the Family Compact to the company's incorporation. There were no general incorporation laws in this period. Incorporation required a special law being passed in each case. The Company sought incorporation in 1828 in order to get the deed to their water lot. The bill to incorporate them was blocked in 1829, 1830, 1831. In 1835 they tried a different approach, seeking incorporation as a bank after a Special Committee of the Assembly had established that joint-stock banks did not require a legislated charter. The Family Compact, which had blocked their incorporation bills, made joint stock banks illegal in 1837.

At half the price offered by a domestic Yugoslav competitor, J≈Ω series 410 EMU built by Go≈°a, the Soviet ER31 () built by Rƒ´gas Vagonb≈´ves R≈´pnƒ´ca (RVR) was chosen. The first unit was introduced in traffic at September 25, 1980. EMU was designated as J≈Ω 412/416. From 1980 to 1990 and with the breakup of Yugoslavia, 50 EMU train sets were delivered from the Soviet Union to Yugoslav railways. ≈ΩTP Belgrade and ≈ΩTP Novi Sad received 43 sets, ≈ΩTP Titograd received six, and ≈ΩTP Skopje received four sets of 412/416 EMU. During the 1990s nine more sets were ordered, but due to the sanctions on FR Yugoslavia, only three were delivered while six were sold to Bulgarian State Railways (BD≈Ω). EMU for BD≈Ω was designated by RVR as ER33 (–≠–†33), in Bulgaria - BD≈Ω class 33; these items were more simple in design. The last two train sets 412/416 for Serbia had more powerful traction motors and was designated by RVR as ER35 (–≠–†35).  Technical specifications  The EMU train set consists from four sections: two cab-motor cars (412) and two trailer cars (416). The trains could be controlled and operated only from cab cars (412).  Voltage  This train set utilises 25 kV/50 Hz AC.

In 1844-1845 Maizan reached as far as the district of Dege la Mhora, on the Uzaramo plateau about 80-150 kilometers from the coast, where he was seized by Zaramo tribesmen under Hemb√©, the son of Chief Mazungera, and bound to a calabash tree before being tortured, mutilated and murdered. Hemb√© amputated Maizan's limbs and sliced off his genitals while still alive before beheading him. Hemb√© later claimed to be acting on the orders of Arab ivory traders. This book mistakenly gives Maizan's year of death as 1844.  Expedition in tropical Africa   Preparation  Maizan studied at the √âcole Polytechnique. He was appointed to the rank of lieutenant (enseigne de vaisseau) by order of King Louis Philippe I on 1 January 1840. Upon returning from a campaign made in the waters of East Africa, in late 1843 Maizan conceived the project to explore the lakes of the East African interior, journeying from east to west from Zanzibar. The campaign took place in 1843 aboard the corvette La Dordogne under the command of Captain Charles Guillain. In 1844, once his mission was accepted by the relevant ministries, Eug√®ne Maizan went to Bourbon, where he boarded the corvette Berceau commanded by Captain Joseph Romain-Desfoss√©s. This ship went to Zanzibar to sign a treaty with Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, and install the new Consul, M. Broquant. Initially, the plan was to begin the exploration of tropical Africa from Zanzibar. Maizan's program was to journey to Lake Chad, then try to find the source of the White Nile. He would then, after passing the Niger, return to Europe through the Sahara. The Soci√©t√© Orientale de France (Oriental Society of France), of which he was a member, had given him a few questions that he should strive to answer during his journey.  History  Maizan landed on Zanzibar Island at the end of 1844.\\"The Lake Regions of Central Equatorial Africa\\" (Burton), pp. 93-96. He spent more than eight months at the Sultanate of Zanzibar in order to learn Kisawahili, during which he changed his plans and regularly increased his baggage. Maizan ultimately left the island in haste, having seen a French vessel entering the harbor and fearing that he would be recalled. He had visited the coast three times before finally landing. The Banians (who had strong commercial interests in the region) feared that the French were occupying the region, and Maizan was wrongly believed to have been sent to prepare for the arrival of the French troops. They probably used their influence to push Maizan to leave the island quickly. The Sultan offered Maizan an armed guard of forty musketeers, but Maizan declined in his haste to depart. The explorer left Zanzibar on 21 April 1845 and made landfall in Bagamoyo (opposite Zanzibar). He then traveled to Dege la Mhora, accompanied only by Fr√©d√©rique, a man from Madagascar or the Comoros, and a few other followers. Initially, Maizan had planned to take a caravan of merchants' ivory, but changed his mind given the amount of baggage. During his journey, he was warned that P'hazi Mazungera (or Mz≈≠ng√©ra), the chief of the Wakamba subtribe of the Wazaramo, wanted him. To better prepare for their journey and learn about what to expect in the land, the expedition spent a few days on the coast. Maizan then decided to make a big detour to avoid the territories of the bloodthirsty leader who seemed to have bad intentions towards him. After two days of walking (to cover in a direct line a distance equal to three days of travel), Maizan stopped in the village of Dagu√©tamohor. It was from this village that he sent a letter to the consul of France based in Zanzibar (M. Broquant did not receive the letter until 10 August 1845), asking him to send his baggage. He entrusted this task to a servant who betrayed him and gave the location of Maizan's camp to Mazungera. The African leader came upon the French at the end of July 1845 at the village of Dege la Mhora. Maizan was initially taken in by Mazungera's false hospitality. After a few days, Mazungera accused Maizan of giving gifts to other chiefs. Fr√©d√©rique was saved by Mazungera's wife, but Maizan apparently did not have the presence of mind to touch her. Manzugera, falsely believing that Maizan was carrying treasure, tortured him to find out where it was hidden. His arms were bound around a pole to which his legs and head were secured with rope. Manzugera's son Hemb√© cut off Maizan's limbs and genitals, then cut his throat and beheaded him, interrupting the throat-cutting to sharpen the knife in front of Maizan before killing him. This book also mistakenly gives Maizan's year of death as 1844. Fr√©d√©rique subsequently disappeared from Zanzibar, and reportedly fled to Marungu on Lake Tanganyika. The French consul arranged to collect the material left by the unfortunate explorer.  After the expedition  Ordered to judge Mazungera under the French laws, the Naval Division Commander of Bourbon and Madagascar, Joseph Romain-Desfoss√©s, made several requests to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman to capture the criminal.Guillain, p. XVIII. Not having achieved anything, Joseph Romain-Desfoss√©s charged Charles Guillain (who then started to explore the eastern coast of Africa) to remind the Sultan of his commitment to deliver the murderer to the French authorities. The Sultan sent an army of 300-400 musketeers after Mazungera, but they discovered that he had fled. Hemb√© led his father's tribe into a few days of skirmishes against the Zanzibaris. The man who had beaten the drum during Maizan's killing was taken into custody and put in chains at Zanzibar, where he eventually died.Jeal, p. 67. Hemb√© later told John Hanning Speke that he had killed Maizan on his father's orders. Because Mazungera held a title conferred by the Sultan, Speke, who was favorably disposed toward Africans, blamed Maizan's death on the urging of Arabs who did not want Europeans interfering with the ivory trade. Speke assumed that Hemb√© would have been killed if he had disobeyed.Jeal, p. 129. Famed explorer Richard Francis Burton would later comment that the Wazaramo had greatly declined in power and importance since Maizan's death, and that \\"few murders have been more pregnant in their consequences than that of M. Maizan in East Africa.\\"  References  Category:1819 births Category:1845 deaths Category:Deaths by decapitation Category:√âcole Polytechnique alumni Category:Explorers of Africa Category:French explorers Category:French Navy officers Category:French people murdered abroad Category:French torture victims Category:Male murder victims Category:Murder in 1845 Category:Murdered explorers Category:People from Montauban Category:People murdered in Tanzania ","title":"Eug√®ne Maizan"},{"id":"37891106","text":"Brandon Nozaki Miller, commonly known as both \\"Electric Cowboy\\" and \\"Sparky\\", is the world's first motorcycle racer to get licensed to race on an electric motorcycle, and went on to become the world's first professional racer to have never ridden a motorcycle powered by anything other than electricity.

United States, 568 U.S. 23 (2012), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States holding that it was possible for government-induced, temporary flooding to constitute a \\"taking\\" of property under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, such that compensation could be owed to the owner of the flooded property.. The case was brought by an Arkansas state agency, alleging that federal flood control practices along the Black River had damaged valuable timber on state-owned lands. The Commission's lawsuit was supported by advocates for property rights, as well as by fish, forestry and wildlife groups. In opposition, the federal government cited the concern that an adverse ruling could expose it to massive liability for its nationwide flood control efforts. The Court's decision revitalized the Arkansas agency's lawsuit, which had been reversed on appeal after a $5.7 million judgment had been entered in its favor against the U.S. government. The Supreme Court restricted its holding to the issue of whether temporary flooding was categorically excluded from qualifying as a taking, leaving to the lower appellate court to review the remaining legal issues and merits of the judgment on remand. Background of the case The case arose from the management of Clearwater Dam by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps followed a water control plan under which it released water from the dam at rates depending on the season. Between 1993 and 2000, however, the Corps deviated from this plan at the request of farmers, by releasing water during a period that extended into the timber-growing season of the Dave Donaldson Black River Wildlife Management Area, which is owned and managed by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, an Arkansas state agency.Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, 568 U.S. at ___ (slip op., at 2-4). The Commission sued the United States, arguing that the temporary flooding of its Management Area, and consequent damage of valuable timber, constituted a taking of property for which it was entitled to compensation under the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause. The Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of the Commission and awarded it $5.7 million for the lost timber and the cost of reforesting.Summarized at 568 U.S. at ___ (slip op., at 4-6); original decision at Arkansas Game and Fish Comm'n v. United States, 87 Fed. Cl. 594 (2009). The ruling was reversed on appeal by a divided panel of the Federal Circuit, on the basis that there could be no takings claim unless the flooding was \\"permanent or inevitably recurring.\\"Summarized at 568 U.S. at ___ (slip op., at 6); original decision at Arkansas Game and Fish Comm'n v. United States, 637 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The Supreme Court's decision The Court only had the issue before it of whether government-induced temporary flooding was categorically exempt from the scope of the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause. In a unanimous, eight-justice opinion delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Justice Kagan did not participate, having worked on the case as Solicitor General prior to her appointment to the Court. See the Court ruled that there was no basis in its Takings Clause jurisprudence for such an exemption. After reviewing 140 years of takings clause flood cases, the Court focused its attention on rejecting the United States' argument. The Solicitor General relied primarily on a 1924 case where the Court had stated that to establish liability, an overflow must be the direct result of \\"an actual, permanent invasion of the land.\\"Arkansas Game and Fish Comm'n, slip. op., at 10 (citing Sanguinetti v. United States, 264 U.S. 146, 150 (1924)). While never going so far as to label the statement dicta, the 2012 Court reasoned that even if the 1924 Court's \\"passing statement\\" had established a general limitation, that limitation had been superseded by the temporary takings logic developed in First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304.Id. at 10. The Court took care not to express an opinion on a theory first advanced at oral argument that the takings clause only applies to flooding upstream, not downstream; or to consider an amicus argument based on water rights.Arkansas Game and Fish Comm'n, slip op., at 13; Tr. of Oral Arg. 30-39; Brief for United States 26-27; http://blog.pacificlegal.org/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2012/09/11-597-bsac-Professors-of-Property-and-Water-Right.pdf . The Court left to the Federal Circuit on remand to decide if either of those issues was preserved, as well as a host of Government challenges to the Court of Federal Claims' fact-findings.Id. at 15. Reactions The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission's position was supported by the National Association of Home Builders, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and the American Forest Resource Council, among others. The Pacific Legal Foundation also hailed the Court's decision as an important victory for property rights. Carrie Severino, writing for National Review, characterized the decision as \\"yet another unanimous defeat\\" for the Obama administration before the Supreme Court, which she wrote had \\"developed a noted pattern of adopting positions that fail to sway even one justice.\\" Severino attributed this in part to the government's \\"extreme position\\", that landowners downstream of a federally managed dam knew the risks of flooding and so should never get compensation, which \\"went beyond what was logically required to make its point.\\". Lyle Denniston of SCOTUSblog was similarly critical of the government's approach at oral argument, which he derided as the equivalent of \\"trust us\\" being offered as a legal standard. Denniston noted that the government's \\"boldness was something of a jolt to the oral argument ... and left some Justices in wonderment.\\".

David Eisenhower * David Eisenhower, the grandson of the real life president Dwight D. Eisenhower, was President in the 1976 film Tunnelvision (set in 1985), and a former President in 1997 in Americathon. Both films were directed by Neal Israel. Dwight D. Eisenhower * In Poul Anderson's The Psychotechnic League, Dwight Eisenhower died from surgical complications in June 1956 and was succeeded by his 43-year-old vice president Richard Nixon, who became the 35th President. Only a few years removed from his active participation in the House Un-American Activities Committee and with his anti- Communist zeal untampered by the pragmatism which he might have gained in later life, President Nixon embarked on a wild, provocative and confrontational policy with respect to the Soviet Union. By 1958, this resulted in a worldwide nuclear war, in which Nixon himself was killed along with hundreds of millions of other people. * In one of the alternate timelines featured in Michael P. Kube-McDowell's novel Alternities, Dwight Eisenhower was killed in a plane crash in 1951. Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio was elected as the 34th President in 1952. President Taft pursued a policy of isolationism which allowed the Soviet Union to emerge as the dominant superpower. Taft subsequently died shortly into his term in office. * In another of the alternate timelines featured in Michael P. Kube-McDowell's novel Alternities, Dwight Eisenhower lost his bid for re-election in 1956 to Adlai Stevenson. President Stevenson was re-elected in 1960, though he would later describe his second term as a curse. * In the alternate history short story \\"We Could Do Worse\\" by Gregory Benford, Senator Robert A. Taft secured the Republican presidential nomination at the 1952 Republican National Convention, narrowly beating Dwight Eisenhower, with the support of the California delegation which was delivered by Senator Richard Nixon. In the election the following November, Taft defeated Adlai Stevenson and was inaugurated as the 34th President on January 20, 1953. However, after only six months in office, President Taft died of a heart attack on July 31, 1953, as occurred in reality. He was succeeded by his vice president Joseph McCarthy, who went on to create a brutal dictatorship in the United States. * In the alternate history short story \\"The Impeachment of Adlai Stevenson\\" by David Gerrold included in the anthology Alternate Presidents edited by Mike Resnick, Dwight Eisenhower was defeated by his Democratic opponent Adlai Stevenson, the Governor of Illinois, in 1952 after he made the mistake of accepting Joseph McCarthy as his running mate instead of Richard Nixon. He successfully ran for re-election in 1956, once again defeating General Eisenhower. However, Stevenson proved to be an extremely unpopular president. As the title of the story implies, Stevenson, the 34th President, was impeached during his second term in August 1958 and resigned, leaving his untested 41-year-old Vice- President, John F. Kennedy, as his successor. Kennedy was considered something of a laughing stock, having recently married the Hollywood actress Marilyn Monroe. This lead satirists to dub the marriage \\"the new Monroe Doctrine.\\" Although the story ends immediately after Stevenson has decided to resign, it is heavily implied that Nixon, already the front runner for the next Republican nomination, will defeat Kennedy in the 1960 election. This is due to the public's antipathy towards the Democrats and the fact that Kennedy is a much derided figure due to his marriage to Monroe. * In the HBO television adaptation of the alternate history novel Fatherland by Robert Harris, General Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe, oversaw the landing operations of the Allied invasion of Normandy, the first phase of Operation Overlord during World War II, on June 6, 1944, which were successfully defeated and repelled by Nazi Germany's forces. Consequently, the United States turned its back on the Western Front and focused its attention on defeating Japan, allowing Germany the necessary time to regroup, annex Western and Southern Europe and therefore win the war. After the failure of the D-Day invasion, Eisenhower returned to the United States and retired in disgrace. * In a parallel universe featured in the Sliders Season Five episode \\"The Return of Maggie Beckett\\", the German forces broke through the Allied lines at the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, which caused World War II to drag on until 1947. General Eisenhower was relieved as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe and returned to the United States in disgrace. Consequently, Adlai Stevenson became President. The Stevenson administration made the Roswell UFO Incident in July 1947 public knowledge and signed the Reticulan-American Free Trade Agreement (RAFTA), giving the US access to advanced Reticulan technology. This led to a human mission to Mars in the 1990s. * In the 2015 alternate history novel Joe Steele by Harry Turtledove, Dwight Eisenhower was a prominent American military leader, who rose to the rank of general during the dictatorial reign of President Joe Steele, and proved instrumental to the country's victory over Japan in the Pacific Theater during World War II. In 1934, Major Eisenhower came to prominence as part of the military tribunal that presided over the trial of the Supreme Court Four. After surviving the purges of the 1930s, he and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz planned and executed the operation that took control of the Solomon Islands from the Japanese during World War II. He then planned and executed the capture of Tarawa, Saipan, Angaur, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Eisenhower then planned and executed Operation Downfall which was executed in two parts: Operation: Olympic and Operation: Coronet. The war ended with the death of Emperor Hirohito and ascension of his twelve-year-old son Akihito who, while nominally the head of state, became a puppet to Eisenhower. Eisenhower remained part of the Steele Administration during and after the Japanese War. The Republican Party tried to recruit both Eisenhower and Omar Bradley as potential presidential nominee in 1952, but both Bradley and Eisenhower (after some prompting from Joe Steele's allies) declined with Eisenhower stating that politics was no place for soldiers. The Republicans chose Robert Taft as their candidate, who in turn lost to Steele in the general election. * In the Worldwar series novel Upsetting the Balance by Harry Turtledove, Dwight Eisenhower was a prominent general during World War II and the war against the Race's Conquest Fleet. In 1944, he traveled through Missouri with Albert Einstein, Benito Mussolini, Robert Goddard, Sam Yeager, Ullhass, and Ristin. As the war wound down, Eisenhower led a successful counter-offensive against the Race's toehold within the state. * In Harry Turtledove's alternate history novel The Man with the Iron Heart, General Dwight \\"Ike\\" Eisenhower became the senior United States Army official on the ground in Allied-occupied Germany after the end of World War II. He was firmly in favor of a continued American occupation of the country, even after the German Freedom Front began inflicting massive casualties upon Allied troops, and the will of the American people began to erode. Nonetheless, the possibility that Eisenhower might be the Republican Party's choice to run against President Harry S. Truman in 1948 was already being floated in 1946 around the time he was transferred back home and was succeeded by General Lucius D. Clay. * In Harry Turtledove's Hot War series, where the Korean War escalates into World War III, Dwight Eisenhower was being bandied about as the Republican presidential nominee for the 1952 election. In May 1951, as World War III was underway, incumbent President Harry S. Truman reflected on Eisenhower as possible president, finding him an amiable but lightweight executive better fit to run a car company rather than a country. Despite this, Truman found Eisenhower a more palatable choice than Senator Joseph McCarthy, who was slowly getting his own campaign underway. Throughout the remainder of 1951, Eisenhower still seemed to be viable, but McCarthy's increasingly heated rhetoric seemed to be gaining support. Still, Eisenhower's role in World War II did seem to give him an edge over many of his Republican rivals such as McCarthy and Robert Taft, to say nothing of the Democrats as a whole. The course of the war changed the political calculus completely, when most of the contenders for the presidency were killed by the Soviet atomic bombing of Washington, D.C. in May 1952. As Eisenhower was not in Washington at the time, it seemed likely he would become the Republican nominee by default. * In the short story \\"An Old Man's Summer\\" by Esther Friesner in the anthology Alternate Generals edited by Harry Turtledove and Roland J. Green, President Dwight D. Eisenhower travels through a time portal to 1863 and witnesses the Battle of Gettysburg. * In the short story \\"I Shall Return\\" by John Mina in the anthology Alternate Generals III edited by Harry Turtledove, General Dwight D. Eisenhower alongside George Patton and Jimmy Doolittle end up garrison in the Battle of the Philippines in December 1941 rather than in Europe. Joycelyn Elders * In a parallel universe featured in the Sliders Season One episode \\"Luck of the Draw\\", Joycelyn Elders was President in 1995. In this universe as in real life, the 18th-century English economist Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus published his highly influential An Essay on the Principle of Population which warned that humanity would be condemned to misery and poverty because the rate of population growth would increase faster than the rate of food supply. Taking Malthus' theory seriously, the inhabitants of this version of Earth managed to keep the world population down to 500,000,000. San Francisco had a population of less than 100,000 people, giving it the feel of a small city rather than a major metropolis. The population was maintained at this low level through heavy emphasis on birth control (provided in the form of soft drinks) and the Lottery system. The Lottery itself worked like an ATM except that people asked for money from it. The more money a person asked for, the higher the chance that he/she would be chosen to participate in a euthanasia program which rewarded the beneficiaries of those who chose to \\"make way\\". Pro-life movements swept across the United States to fight the Lottery. While the manner of death was humane, protesters believed that population could be controlled through other means. President Elders did not agree with this assessment and the Lottery system continued unabated as of 1996. F Geraldine Ferraro * In the short story \\"Bloody Bunnies\\" by Bradley Denton contained in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, the Denton of an alternate timeline finds himself trapped in our universe. It is implied that he became a kind of walk-in spirit, his consciousness entering the body of his counterpart after his original body died in a car accident. Denton refers to former President Geraldine Ferraro several times. One of her many accomplishments was \\"the Universal Health Care and Child-Proof Trigger Lock Initiative\\". Millard Fillmore * In the short story \\"How the South Preserved the Union\\" by Ralph Roberts contained in the anthology Alternate Presidents edited by Mike Resnick, General Zachary Taylor was elected as the 12th President in 1848 with Millard Fillmore as his running mate, as happened in real life. Shortly after taking office, however, both he and President Taylor were killed in a carriage accident. Taylor was succeeded by David Rice Atchison, the President pro tempore of the United States Senate and a prominent pro-slavery activist, who became the 13th President. Shortly after President Atchison's accession, the American Civil War broke out on April 17, 1849, with the secession of Massachusetts from the Union and the Second Battle of Lexington and Concord, from which the rebelling abolitionists, who styled themselves as the New Minutemen, emerged victorious. New Hampshire and Vermont seceded shortly thereafter and were soon followed by the three remaining New England states, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The seceding Northeastern states banded together to form the New England Confederacy with Daniel Webster as its first and only president and the revolutionary abolitionist John Brown as the commander of its army. The war came to an end in 1855, two years after President Atchison had issued a proclamation promising that any slave who fought in the United States Army would be granted his freedom following the end of the war and that any factory slave who worked satisfactorily would be granted his or her freedom after the war and would be paid for that work from then onwards. Stephen Douglas succeeded Atchison as the 14th President after being elected in 1860 and introduced the Civil Rights Act 1861 which brought an end to slavery in the United States in its entirety. * In the short story \\"Now Falls the Cold, Cold Night\\" by Jack L. Chalker, also contained in the anthology Alternate Presidents edited by Mike Resnick, Millard Fillmore was elected the Know Nothing Party candidate in 1856, defeating the Democratic candidate James Buchanan (who had suffered a stroke in October) and the Republican candidate John C. Fr√©mont. He therefore became the 15th President, having previously served as the 13th President from 1850 to 1853 as a member of the Whig Party. His vice president was Andrew Jackson Donelson, the namesake nephew of former President Andrew Jackson. When Fillmore upholds the Fugitive slave laws in 1858, this resulted in ethnic tensions and riots in New England that lead it to secede from the Union. John C. Fr√©mont becomes President of the New England Confederacy with William Tecumseh Sherman as his commanding general, opposed by the Army of the United States under Robert E. Lee. Gerald Ford * In one of the timelines featured in the novel Replay by Ken Grimwood, Gerald Ford was defeated by Ronald Reagan, the former Governor of California, in the Republican Party's presidential primaries in 1976. Reagan went on to defeat his Democratic opponent Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election, taking office as the 39th President on January 20, 1977. In November 1979, President Reagan went to war with Iran over the hostage crisis. * In the alternate history short story \\"Demarche to Iran\\" by Alexis A. Gilliland contained in the anthology Alternate Presidents edited by Mike Resnick, Gerald Ford defeated his Democratic opponent Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election after he gave former president Richard Nixon a specific, rather than general, pardon, thus keeping his popularity high enough that he reelected president. Illinois shifted from Democrat to Republican after the second recount is also a result of Ford's victory. His vice president was Bob Dole. As he had served more than two years of his predecessor Richard Nixon's second term, he was not eligible to run for re-election in the 1980 presidential election. On November 4, 1979, militant Iranian students who supported the Iranian Revolution took 63 American citizens hostage after seizing control of the US Embassy in Tehran. Although his Chief of Staff Dick Cheney suggested seizing Iranian bank accounts, Ford was convinced by his masseur to present the Iranian ambassador, Doctor Mehdi Haeri Yazdi, with a d√©marche threatening to sever diplomatic relations with Iran if the hostages were not returned within three days. He did so over the initial objections of two key members of his cabinet. Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State, was concerned that war with Iran would result if the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ignored the d√©marche and the negative impact that this would have on Soviet Union‚ÄìUnited States relations. He also reminded the President that, in spite of the Ayatollah, Iran was a friendly nation as well as the United States‚Äô only bulwark against the USSR in the Persian Gulf. Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, believed that a war would cost the Republicans the 1980 election. As Kissinger predicted, the Ayatollah initially ignored the d√©marche. As he explained to President Abolhassan Banisadr and General Mohammed Suliman, he was willing to accept the possibility of war with the United States as he believed that the Americans would eventually lose heart or a new president would be elected. During a press conference in the Rose Garden of the White House, the President failed to remember that Iran was not a naval power and instead referred to nuclear weapons. This remark was interpreted by the American media, the Iranian authorities and the rest of the world as Ford voicing his intention to use such weapons on Iran if the hostages were not returned by the expiration of the d√©marche. Within hours, the Soviet Union and the People‚Äôs Republic of China issued strong diplomatic protests over the comment. It also resulted in one million people protesting at a demonstration in London, one and a half million people protesting at a similar demonstration in Tokyo and the US embassies in Pakistan, Syria and Iran being burned. The Ayatollah did not take this threat seriously and instructed the newly appointed Minister of the Interior Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to appear on live television in front of the US Embassy and tell the Iranian people that they would stand resolute in the face of American provocation. However, Rafsanjani was attacked by protesters fearful of a nuclear strike and was strangled with his own turban. His death was televised and shown all over the world. This incident convinced the Ayatollah Khomeini to back down and order the students to release the hostages. Although all 63 hostages were released unharmed only four days after they were captured, Ford was severely criticized for threatening to use nuclear weapon on a non- nuclear, friendly nation, a costly mistake which permanently alienated Iran from the United States‚Äô cause. It was regarded as being as serious a failure for American diplomacy as the Vietnam War had been for American arms. The incident came to be seen as \\"the most serious of many blunders committed by President Ford during his term of office.\\" Harrison Ford * Portrayed as the president in an episode in VIP * Referred to as a former president in the film Scary Movie 3 when current president Baxter Harris \\"[wonders] what President Harrison Ford would have done\\". The audience is led to believe he's referring to actual president Gerald Ford, but the portrait shows Harrison Ford's image, possibly a reference to the 1997 film Air Force One. Henry Ford * Mary A. Kumnel's novelette \\"The Model T of Politics\\" takes place in a history in which Imperial Germany avoided attacking American shipping in World War I. The US stayed out of the war, which ended with a decisive German victory in February 1918. The German Army occupied Paris, and at Versailles Kaiser Wilhelm II upgraded himself to Emperor of Europe and forced the defeated French to accept him as their Overlord, followed by virtually all other European nations. Britain remained outside the European Imperial structure, but Wilhelm forced a dynastic marriage, culminating with his grandson Wilhelm IV eventually combining the German-European Throne and the British one. On the other side of the ocean, the US was undergoing a prolonged economic slump and social crisis. In the Presidential elections of 1932, both Democrats and Republicans came up with pale, uninspiring candidates. It was then that Henry Ford suddenly joined the fray, running as a Third Party candidate under the slogan The Model T of Politics, and throwing most of his personal fortune into the campaign. The voters accepted the argument that a man so successful in private business was the right person to heal the national economy, and Ford was elected by a landslide. After Wilhelm IV assumed the combined German and British Thrones in 1934, placing Canada along with the rest of the British Empire inside the German sphere of influence, President Ford assumed an increasingly bellicose posture, speaking vehemently on \\"The German Threat\\" and putting the country on a war footing. By the later 1930s war with Germany came to be seen as inevitable, the last straw being the Azores Crisis - Germany having forced Portugal to accept the creation of a major German naval base at the Azores, despite a vociferous American protest. In September 1939 President Ford got a large Congressional majority to back his declaration of war against Germany, Britain, and all their allies and subsidiaries. In his Speech to The Nation Ford stated: \\"What we have today embarked on is no simple war.It is a Holy Crusade for the Very Soul of Humanity. It is well known that International Jews are the true power behind the German Throne! It is the sinister Elders of Zion who make the decisions - the Kaiser, his courtiers and ministers and generals are but the lackeys and puppets of the Jews, slavishly carrying out the dictates of their masters! Even now the notorious Einstein and his coterie of Satanic Talmudic Jewish scientists are working day and night to develop horrendous weapons by which Jewish Germany hopes to get complete Mastery of the World! Jewish Germany has spread its tentacles over the whole of Eurasia and nibbles at South America. Britain is now no more than a German puppet - that is, a Jewish puppet. The minions of the Jews are even now peeking over our northern border! The United States is the last great redoubt and bastion of Free Western White Christian Man. If we fall, then Humanity falls under perpetual bondage and slavery to the Jews. But we shall not fall! We shall prevail, we shall win, we shall utterly win, we shall smash the Germans and their Jewish masters once and for all!\\" At a secret White House meeting with Edgar Hoover of the NIO (National Investigative Office), the President finalized plans for the mass internment of American Jews, Hoover providing some purported evidence to be presented in order to substantiate the claim that Jews were \\"a disloyal, unreliable part of the American public\\", that the majority of them had \\"outspoken Pro-German attitudes\\" and that some \\"powerful Jewish groups\\" were acting directly on orders from Berlin. \\"To effectively wage war on Germany, we must not neglect the threat posed on our own shores by Germany's Jewish friends and agents\\" stated the President when announcing the imposition of Martial Law in New York's Lower east Side and other areas with a high Jewish population. The novelette ends at this point, not describing how the war finally turned out. Michael J. Fox * Michael J. Fox is mentioned as being a former president in the 1989 video game Mean Streets. In real life, Michael J. Fox is ineligible for the presidency, as he was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Al Franken * President in Why Not Me?, a satirical novel by Al Franken himself. He was elected as the 43rd President in 2000, running as a dark horse candidate on a platform of eliminating ATM fees. He is eventually given the Democratic nomination over the incumbent vice president and early favourite Al Gore due in a rise in support when the Y2K bug solely effects ATMs. He was the first Jewish President and won in a landslide. Franken's running mate was Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, making the Franken-Lieberman ticket the first all-Jewish presidential ticket since Reconstruction. President Franken suffered from severe depression and mood swings. For instance, he attacked Nelson Mandela and appointed Sandy Koufax as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. President Franken resigned after 144 days in office on June 10, 2001. In his resignation speech, he said: \\"It is my fondest wish that, in the fullness of time, the American people will look back on the Franken presidency as something of a mixed bag and not as a complete disaster.\\" Lieberman succeeded him as the 44th President, going on to serve a total of eighteen years in office. In stark contrast to Franken, President Lieberman was widely considered to be one of the greatest Presidents in US history. In real life, Franken went on to serve as United States Senator from Minnesota from 2009 to 2018 as a member of the Minnesota Democratic‚ÄìFarmer‚ÄìLabor Party. The novel, which was written in 1999, correctly predicted that Lieberman would be the Democratic vice presidential nominee in the 2000 election, though with Gore rather than Franken as the presidential candidate. Benjamin Franklin * Listed as a former President in the Doctor Who audio play Seasons of Fear. It is unclear whether this refers to him being President in the original Doctor Who timeline or one of the fictional ones implied by the time corruption depicted in this story. * In the short story \\"The Father of His Country\\" by Jody Lynn Nye contained in the anthology Alternate Presidents edited by Mike Resnick, Benjamin Franklin was elected as the first President of the United States by the 1st United States Congress on April 6, 1789, defeating his sole opponent George Washington and achieving a clear mandate to govern in the process. In spite of the fact that Franklin was 83 years old and was rumored to have fathered numerous illegitimate children while serving as ambassador to France from 1778 to 1785, he ultimately won the election in part due to reservations voiced by prominent members of Congress such as John Hancock and Charles Thomson regarding Washington. They were concerned that it would set a bad precedent for the first President to be a general. Furthermore, Franklin's supporters stressed that he was well liked and respected by foreign heads of state friendly to the United States, had been prominent in matters of diplomacy and government at home and abroad and had already proven that he had the best interests of the nation at heart. When he was offered the presidency after his election, Franklin emulated the fictionalized Julius Caesar's stance in the Shakespearean tragedy of the same name who denied the crown of Rome three times in Act 1, Scene 2 of the play. Consequently, he only accepted the position on being offered it for the fourth time. He was inaugurated in Federal Hall in New York City on April 30, 1789. His vice president was John Adams who had supported Washington in Congress, as had his second cousin Samuel Adams. During his tenure in office, President Franklin attempted to create a more democratic society and managed to live longer than he did in real life. Shortly after taking office, he began to insist on organizing the government as if it were a business. In a letter to his wife Abigail Adams, Vice President Adams was scornful of the idea that a government \\"could run with the same dispatch and efficiency as a printshop.\\" However, the notion proved to be extremely popular with the citizenry as President Franklin was often surrounded by his supporters, friends and former subscribers while walking through the streets of Philadelphia. Adams believed that his role as President of the Senate would mean that the vice presidency would soon eclipse the presidency in importance and prestige. In September 1789, President Franklin made a speech decrying ambition and avarice as the two principal sins besetting the United States. The speech, which was published in the Philadelphia Gazette, was popular with Quakers, small merchants and farmers but less so with the landowners and aristocrats who made up the Congress. Congress also moved to insist that Franklin limit his writings to only the most serious of topics so as not to adversely affect the dignity of his office. Although he outwardly complied, Adams was aware that he continued to write his satires and hoaxes, which he published under various pseudonyms. One of these was a playful satire regarding Great Britain's position on trade with the United States which was attributed to a \\"Mr. Newly.\\" On being confronted by Adams about the piece, Franklin did not admit or deny writing it but \\"his eyes twinkled with mischief.\\" Losing patience with the elderly president, Adams told him that he must accede to Congress' request to cease from publishing such ephemera as the United States had gained the upper hand in its trade negotiations with Britain and did not want it to be ruined by a trivial matter. To Adams' annoyance, the Newly piece had become very popular with the general public and encouraged them to support the trade negotiations. While this proved advantageous to the government in the short-term, Adams confided in his wife that could also serve to set a precedent which he and his colleagues sought to avoid, namely allowing the public control of their government. In defiance of Congress' numerous requests, Franklin continued to publish articles using pseudonyms. In one commentary published in March 1791, the President stated that a trade agreement with Britain should be reached with great alacrity. Furthermore, Franklin attempted to manipulate the public through these articles by voicing the opinion that proposed bills should be presented to the public before being presented to Congress. This led to Adams being accosted by a tavern owner who objected to the new duty on rum. Adams was concerned that, if this trend continued, he and his fellow politicians would be forced to the indignity of consulting their constituents before voting in Congress, which he regarded as an absurd notion which would delay the workings of government. In a letter dated April 29, 1792, Adams confided in his wife Abigail that he regarded Franklin as \\"a meddlesome old man\\" and was privately relieved that his advanced age meant that he was coming to the end of his life. When that day came, Adams stated that he and his colleagues would be able to get on with the business of government unhindered. * On The Price is Right, whenever someone wins a bonus for a perfect bid, host Drew Carey jokes that \\"Ben Franklin was his favorite president,\\" in reference to Franklin appearing on the $100 bills given to the contestants who score the perfect bids. G Albert Gallatin * In the alternate history novel The Probability Broach as part of the North American Confederacy Series by L. Neil Smith, Albert Gallatin intercedes in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 to the benefit of the farmers rather than the fledgling US Government like he did in real history. The rebellion soon escalates into a Second American Revolution. Soon, an army of farmers march into the capital Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and they overthrow and execute George Washington by firing squad for treason. After the war, Gallatin becomes the 2nd president and serves from 1794 to 1812. During his time as president, he declared the Constitution null and void, a new caretaker government is established in 1795, and a revised version of the Articles of Confederation, which severely limiting its powers and grants a much greater emphasis on individual freedom, are ratified in 1797. In 1803, he and James Monroe arranged the Louisiana Purchase from France, borrowing money from private sources against the value of the land. In 1812, he decided to retire and Edmond-Charles Gen√™t would become president. In 1836, Gallatin would step out of retirement and would defeat John C. Calhoun in the 1836 election, becoming the 7th President and serving from 1836 to 1840. By 1986, his likeness was minted on .999 fine gold coins. Gallatin's legacy would eventually led to the formation of the North American Confederacy in 1893. James A. Garfield * In the alternate history novel series Southern Victory book How Few Remain by Harry Turtledove, James Garfield was a Republican senator who represented Ohio in 1882. He had been an officer in the Union Army during the War of Secession (1861‚Äì1862) and had served on a number of courts-martial. He rose to prominence by purging the Army of defeatists after the war. In 1882, Garfield was one of several prominent Republican leaders to attend a convention called by former President Abraham Lincoln in Chicago. He resisted Lincoln's proposal to replace hostility toward the Confederate States of America with workers' rights as the central plank of the party's platform, going so far as to suggest that following Lincoln's plan would cause the Republican party to split into three factions. The meeting ended with Garfield and every other delegate walking out, leaving Lincoln alone. * In the short story I Shall Have a Fight to Glory by Michael P. Kube- McDowell contained in the anthology Alternate Presidents edited by Mike Resnick, James Garfield loses the 1880 election to Samuel J. Tilden after Tilden uses underhanded tactics to win the election. However, Garfield gets help from Charles J. Guiteau (his assassin in real history) and he and Guitaeu vainly attempts to convince Tilden that they can fix the corrupted electoral system. When he declines the offer, they assassinate Tilden before he can be inaugurated as the 20th president. John Nance Garner * In the alternate history novel The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick, John Nance Garner was elected as vice president in 1932 as the running mate of Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, Garner himself was inaugurated as the 32nd President on March 4, 1933 as a result of President-elect Roosevelt's assassination by Giuseppe Zangara on February 15, 1933. He was re-elected in 1936, but failed to combat the Great Depression and the United States remained strongly isolationist. He was succeeded in the 1940 election by the Republican John W. Bricker, who also failed to confront the economic and foreign policy issues. As a result of their combined presidencies, the Axis powers won World War II and invaded and conquered the United States in 1948. * A similar role is assigned to Garner in the history of another Nazi-victorious timeline, the unpleasant GURPS timeline known as Reich-5. In this timeline, too, Zangara succeeded in assassinating Roosevelt, John Nance Garner became President and was unable to handle the Great Depression - followed on this timeline by the equally unsuccessful Charles Lindbergh and Henry Wallace and finally leading to the far-right William Dudley Pelley become President following Lindbergh's assassination and getting elected to a full term in 1944, assuming dictatorial powers, and inviting the Nazis to conquer the US to help him against the pro- democracy resistance - ending with a Nazi-dominated world even worse than the one envisioned by Philip K. Dick. * In the Elseworlds one-shot comic book Superman: War of the Worlds, Vice President Garner became the 33rd President in the aftermath of the Martian invasion of 1938, in which Franklin D. Roosevelt was killed. Lex Luthor was his vice president. * In the 2003 alternate history short story \\"Joe Steele\\" by Harry Turtledove, John Nance Garner was elected vice president in 1932 as the running mate of Congressman Joe Steele of Fresno, who defeated the extremely unpopular Republican incumbent Herbert Hoover to become the 32nd President. In the years that followed, President Steele slowly but surely built up the powers of his office until he was effectively the dictator of the United States. Steele was ultimately elected to six terms from 1932 to 1952. Observing the ruthless manner in which Steele dispatched his enemies, both real and imagined, Garner kept his head down and consequently remained his vice president for 20 years. After Steele died six weeks into his sixth term on March 5, 1953, the 84-year- old Garner briefly succeeded him as the 33rd President and promptly orders the execution of the Vince \\"The Hammer\\" Scriabin (Vyacheslav Molotov) and J. Edgar Hoover. The Hammer likewise orders the execution of Garner and Hoover. Hoover also orders the deaths of Garner and the Hammer. In the end, Hoover triumphs and becomes the 34th president and proves to be even more tyrannical than Steele while Garner is executed. * In the 2015 alternate history novel Joe Steele, which is an expansion of the short-story of the same name, Garner's role in the novel follows mostly the same as in the short story. However, within the following weeks after assuming the presidency following Steele's death in March 1953, Garner has nearly everyone in his cabinet (most made up of Steele's cronies) removed from office. However, a newly courageous Congress would impeach Garner for the sins of Steele, and the executive branch becomes vacant. Garner would retire to Uvalde, Texas while GBI (Government Bureau of Intelligence) director J. Edgar Hoover assumes political control and becomes Director of the United States. Horatio Gates * In 1783, in the direct aftermath of the American War of Independence, the troops camped at Newburgh, New York and due to be disbanded were on the verge of mutiny, due to the Continental Congress being unwilling to finance satisfactory provisions for their peacetime life. In actual history, General George Washington arrived at the soldiers' meeting, delivered the speech known as the Newburgh Address, and managed to dissuade the soldiers from mutiny, harmlessly defusing this \\"Newburgh Conspiracy\\". However, in Katherine B. Knight's story \\"The Newburgh Disaster\\", Washington took a more cautious line - staying away from the meeting and asking a trusted officer to report to him afterwards. In the absence of Washington, the firebrands won over the rest of the troops, and the soldiers embarked on open mutiny. When Washington did try to appeal to them on the following day, it was too late. The mutiny was in full swing, and the mutineers placed Washington under detention and marched on Philadelphia - having as their nominal leader General Horatio Gates, Washington's long- lasting rival. Surrounding Congress with their guns loaded and making blunt threats, the mutineers forced the Continental Congress members to elect Gates as an \\"Emergency President with Full Executive Power\\" and authorize him to \\"Levy Special Taxation on the Several States until the full moneys to defray soldiers' arrears of pay and officers' pensions had been collected\\". The decree was widely regarded as illegal, and various state militias attempted to block the \\"collection of taxation\\" which they regarded as tantamount to looting and robbery. However, the vengeful soldiers broke down such attempted resistance, in several cases ruthlessly shooting down militiamen who had been their own comrades in arms not long before. Having collected the required funds in less than a year, the army disbanded and Gates gave up his irregular \\"Presidency\\" - but not before once again using blunt intimidation to coerce Congress into granting a full pardon to everybody concerned, for all acts committed since the mutiny broke out. The pardon protected Horatio Gates from prosecution, but he suffered heavy social ostracism, and finally left America and returned to England, where he lived out his life in obscurity - his presence being a bit of an embarrassment to the British government. At the time, many hoped and believed that this had been but a short ugly interlude which could be left behind, as Americans girded their loins to build up the edifice of Constitutional rule. That, however, was not the case. The pernicious precedent of military overthrow, accomplished with impunity, was created and could not expunged. In vain did the Founding Fathers seek to build into the Constitution of the United States firm guarantees against the abuse of military authority and for the complete submission of the military to duly elected civilian authority. In later decades and centuries of American history, these constitutional guarantees again and again crumbled before ambitious generals and disaffected troops, acting on real or imagined grievances. Knight's story is written in the form of extracts from \\"The History of the American Tragedy\\", a massive four-volume work published at 1997 in London by the exile American historian Newt Gingrich. There, Gingrich traces to 1783 Newburgh the beginning of the long and tortuous collapse of American democracy - culminating in 1951 with General Douglas MacArthur overthrowing and executing President Harry Truman and establishing a brutal military dictatorship, still very much in power into the 1990s. Edmond- Charles Gen√™t * In the alternate history novel The Probability Broach by L. Neil Smith in which the United States became a libertarian state in 1794 after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrowing and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason, Edmond-Charles Gen√™t served as the 3rd President of the North American Confederacy from 1812 to 1820. John Glenn * In the 1999 short story \\"Hillary Orbits Venus\\" by Pamela Sargent, John Glenn was elected President in 1976 and 1980. His two immediate successors were Bob Dole and Bill Clinton. By 1998, he and Dole were the only living former Presidents. Barry Goldwater * In the short story \\"Fellow Americans\\" by Eileen Gunn in the anthology Alternate Presidents edited by Mike Resnick, Barry Goldwater defeated the early favorite and incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 election to become the 37th President. He was subsequently re-elected in 1968. His vice president was William E. Miller. During his term in office, President Goldwater ordered that nuclear weapons be deployed against North Vietnam in the Vietnam War. By 1990, tactical nuclear weapons were frequently used in the troubled parts of the world, including the Middle East. This led to a high level of genetic mutation among children in the relevant areas as well as mutations in certain species of animals such as rats. There was also speculation that the ongoing AIDS epidemic could be attributed to the significant nuclear fallout over the previous two decades. Having been re-elected in 1968, Goldwater left office after serving two full terms on January 20, 1973. He retired to the Arizona desert where he resided with his wife Peggy until her death in 1985. In the interest of raising contributions for the Barry Goldwater Presidential Museum, Goldwater put his distaste for television aside and agreed to be interviewed by the highly respected PBS political commentator Geraldo Riviera, who questioned him on his use of nuclear weapons in Vietnam, on Geraldo's Manifest Destinies. As Goldwater had never liked nor trusted his fellow Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon, he was pleased that Dwight D. Eisenhower's former vice president had retired from politics in the early 1960s and had therefore never acceded to the nation's highest office. Nixon subsequently parlayed his electoral defeat into television success and was given a late-night talk show entitled Tricky Dick (referring to his famous political nickname) on NBC in 1970. Much to Goldwater's annoyance, the series garnered high ratings from its inception and, by 1990, was still as popular as ever despite being on its twentieth season. He believed that it was time for the 77-year-old Nixon to retire from television as well as politics. Upon reading in The Washington Post that Robert F. Kennedy, the Governor of New York, was considering seeking the Democratic presidential nomination for the 1992 election, Goldwater considered it highly unlikely as he had never actively sought the nomination previously. However, after a failed assassination attempt at the 1990 New York World's Fair, Governor Kennedy informed his wife Ethel Kennedy that he was going to announce in January 1991 that he was indeed planning to run. * In Kim Newman and Eugene Byrne's alternate history novel Back in the USSA, Barry Goldwater is president of the United Socialist States of America (USSA), succeeding Al Capone. Goldwater serves as a parallel to Nikita Khrushchev, and is succeeded by Richard Nixon (Leonid Brezhnev). * In Robert Browning's story Digging in the Ruins, an extraterrestrial archaeologist around the year 15,000 AD conducts a painstaking research lasting some 180 years through the ruins of Washington D.C. and other Earth cities - eventually finding conclusive proof that the extinction of life on Earth was the result of Barry Goldwater being elected President in 1964 and starting an all-out nuclear war in the first (and last) month of his presidency. The story's protagonist gets the equivalent of a PH.D. but his discovery interests only a small circle of fellow specialists, most of his species showing no interest in the extinct humans or why and how they destroyed themselves. Al Gore * Shown as the 43rd and current president in an alternate reality in The One (2001) and in the comic book Hero Squared X-Tra Sized Special. * The One was produced before the outcome of the 2000 Presidential Election was known. In keeping with the film's alternate-universe concept, the filmmakers used stock footage of Al Gore and George W. Bush to create a pair of similar mock-up news broadcasts of each candidate as President. The eventual winner's version would be inserted into a scene in \\"our\\" universe, while the other would be shown in an alternate universe. * Was allowed to sit at the desk of the Oval Office on the set of The West Wing in a skit from Saturday Night Live making fun of the television show and depicting Al Gore, who had just lost the 2000 United States presidential election, as overly eager to act the role of president on his visit to the television set. * The opening sketch of a 2006 episode of Saturday Night Live showed him addressing the nation, describing how his reversal of global warming led to encroaching glaciers, offering to bail out the oil companies because oil prices had dropped dramatically due to the popularity of alternative fuels, California had left the Union to become the nation of \\"Mexifornia\\", Major League Baseball Commissioner George W. Bush was doing his best to crack down on the use of steroids, Afghanistan was an extremely popular Spring Break destination, and a Six Flags theme park had been opened in Tehran * The television series SeaQuest DSV implies that Al Gore had become President sometime before 2032, as the show's namesake vessel was stationed at the nonexistent Fort Gore. * Is mentioned as the president in the webcomic The Spiders, focusing on an alternative American invasion of Afghanistan. * Mentioned as President in the episode \\"Meet the Quagmires\\" of Family Guy when Peter Griffin is allowed by Death to go back in time and ends up marrying Molly Ringwald instead of Lois Pewterschmidt thus allowing Glen Quagmire to marry her instead. Al Gore is President and enacts liberal policies beneficial to the country and has found and strangled Osama bin Laden to death on the set of MADtv. Brian Griffin uses this as an argument to prevent Peter from returning to the past to set things the way they were, but Peter insists on correcting the past. * In The Execution Channel by Ken MacLeod, Al Gore was elected as the 43rd President in 2000, defeating George W. Bush. His vice president was Joe Lieberman. The point explicitly made by the author is that ‚Äì with the September 11 attacks still happening with a Democrat in the White House ‚Äì Gore and Hillary Clinton who succeeds him as President would have undertaken an aggressive War on Terrorism similar to that undertaken by George W. Bush in actual history, leading to an unstable, oppressive situation in the later part of the 21st century when the plot is set. * In the alternate history novel 43*: When Gore Beat Bush - A Political Fable by Jeff Greenfield, Al Gore defeated George W. Bush in 2000 and became the 43rd President. * On Futurama, Al Gore was supposed to become the 43rd president. However, it was revealed in Bender's Big Score that Bender destroyed most of Gore's votes in Florida and caused George W. Bush to become president. Later on in his life, Al Gore would become the first Emperor of the Moon and would be put inside a head in a jar by the year 3000. Ulysses S. Grant * In the alternate history short story \\"We are Not Amused\\" by Laura Resnick contained in the anthology Alternate Presidents edited by Mike Resnick, Ulysses Grant was precluded from running for re-election in 1872 due to a new constitutional amendment which stated that no president may be elected more than once. He was succeeded by Victoria Woodhull, who became the 19th President as well as the first woman to hold the office. * In the alternate history novel The Guns of the South by Harry Turtledove, General Grant's great achievement in 1862‚Äì63 was to seize control of the Mississippi River by defeating a series of uncoordinated Confederate armies and by capturing Vicksburg in July 1863. After a victory at Chattanooga in late 1863, President Abraham Lincoln made him general-in-chief of the Union Army. He faced Confederate General Robert E. Lee during the Battle of the Wilderness through which he attempted to advance on Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital. Grant's superiority in numbers came to naught due to the AK-47s supplied by the Rivington Men, who were in actuality members of the South African white supremacist organisation Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging who had travelled back in time from 2014, to Lee. A second defeat at Bealeton, Virginia allowed Lee to advance on and capture Washington, D.C.. Grant later served as an Election Commissioner during the Kentucky and Missouri statewide referendum on whether they would remain with the Union or join the Confederacy. Although he had a reputation as a heavy drinker, Grant remained abstinent during the election campaign, preferring coffee at dinner with fellow commissioner General Lee. However, the night of the vote, after it became clear Kentucky voted to join the Confederate States while Missouri voted to remain with the Union, he drank himself into a stupor. In 1868, Lee had the opportunity to review Grant's Overland Campaign as it had taken place in the world the Rivington Men had come from. * In the Southern Victory alternate history novel How Few Remain by Harry Turtledove, Ulysses Grant achieved a string of victories in 1862. However, these eventually came to naught as General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia forced the Army of the Potomac under the command of General George B. McClellan onto the banks of the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania and destroyed the opposing army in the Battle of Camp Hill on October 1, 1862. Following this decisive victory, Lee moved eastward and occupied Philadelphia. As a direct result, the Confederate States of America earned diplomatic recognition from the United Kingdom and France, which forced the United States to mediate. The Confederacy therefore gains full recognition in the War of Secession came to an end on November 4, 1862. Grant became deeply depressed and reverted to his pre-war alcoholism. At the outset of the Second Mexican War in 1881, General Grant was one of the few sympathetic members of a crowd in St. Louis addressed by Frederick Douglass. He later died of his alcoholism. As McClellan was considered to be one of the worst generals in US history, the most common criticism of Lincoln in subsequent years was that he did not relieve McClellan of his duties and replace him with a more competent general such as Grant. * In the Elseworlds one-shot comic book Superman: A Nation Divided in which Kal-El's spaceship landed in Kansas during the 1840s and he was raised by a farming couple named Josephus and Sarah Kent, General Grant was at the Battle of Vicksburg on May 23, 1863 when he was notified of the capture of the city and his opponent, Confederate States Army General John C. Pemberton by the superhuman individual Private Atticus Kent. He and General William Tecumseh Sherman realized the potential that Atticus had in the Union Army. When he sent a letter to President Abraham Lincoln informing him of Atticus' tremendous contributions to the war effort, the President wondered if Grant was once again drinking heavily. However, Lincoln was convinced when Atticus came to the Oval Office and demonstrated his powers. He came to agree with Grant's assessment that Atticus would prove to be the Union's secret weapon against the Confederate States of America. Grant later participated in the Battle of Gettysburg, during which Atticus, who was by then a captain, captured Confederate Generals J.E.B. Stuart and Robert E. Lee and instructed the latter to order to his troops to surrender. Atticus spent the next two days burying the dead. General Grant consoled him by telling him that many more men would have been killed if it had not been for Atticus. * In Jane Cobbler's story \\"Reconstuction Forever!\\", Ulysses Grant suspended Habeas Corpus in October 1871 in part of South Carolina and sent Federal troops to enforce the law there, in order to break up the Ku Klux Klan. While the operation was proceeding, Grant was assassinated on November 4, 1871, by five Klansman who had infiltrated Washington, D.C., dressed as manual laborers, pulled pistols and shot down the President, crying out \\"Sic Semper Tyrannis!\\" (as did John Wilkes Booth during the Abraham Lincoln's Assassination over six years earlier). Vice President Schuyler Colfax succeeded to the Presidency and was inaugurated in an atmosphere of extreme tension, surrounded by massed troops and flanked by senior military officers and by Black leaders from the South. Sequoyah Guess * In the alternate history novel The Probability Broach by L. Neil Smith in which the United States became a libertarian state in 1794 after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrowing and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason, Sequoyah Guess served as the 8th President of the North American Confederacy from 1840 until his death in a battle in 1842 by a sniper. He was the first Native American president and was succeeded by Osceola, who served as the 9th president from 1842 to 1848.

Although the case was the third decision on the practice, it was actually the first case brought to the European Court by the Slovak feminist organization Center for Civil and Human Rights already in 2004. The case concerned three Romani women - I.G., R.K. and M.K., who were forcibly sterilized in Krompachy Hospital in Eastern Slovakia. Applicants I.G. and M.K were underage minors at the time of the interventions. I.G. was sterilized in 2000, during the delivery of her second child. She was not informed about the intervention at the time and found out about it only three years later, after she examined her medical records in the Hospital. M.K. was sterilized in 1999, also during the delivery of her second child. She and her parents found about the intervention only after it was already performed on her. The applicant R.H. was sterilized in 2002 without her informed consent Since 2003, all applicants were trying to obtain damages at the Slovak courts, including the Constitutional Court. They also acted as injured parties in the criminal proceedings, led by the Slovak police and prosecutors from 2003 onwards. Only M.K. received compensations from the District Court in Spi≈°sk√° Nov√° Ves in amount of EUR 1,593. The European Court, however, did not find this compensation adequate in the light of the seriousness of the violations. The case was lodged to the European Court already in 2004, claiming violations of several provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. In its decision from 13 November 2012, the European Court ruled in favor of I.G. and M.K. Since, R.K., died during the course of the proceedings, the European Court did not consider her complaint. The European Court declared that the sterilization without informed consent of their legal guardians violated the Slovak legislation valid at the time of the interventions. As such, it violated their right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment, guaranteed by Article 3 of the Convention. Yet again, the European Court found that Slovakia also violated the positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention to provide effective protection of reproductive right of Romani women, who are particularly vulnerable group in the population. Importantly, the decision differs from the previous cases on the matter in the fact that for the first time, the Court also found that the investigation led by the Slovak authorities into the case did not meet the standards of effective investigation guaranteed by the Convention (procedural aspect of Article 3). Apart of the violation of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention, the Court ordered the Slovak Government to pay the compensations to the applicants in amount of 28,500 EUR and 27,000 EUR respectively and the reimbursement of their legal costs References *Judgement of the European Court of 13 November 2012 on Application no. 15966/04 Category:European Court of Human Rights cases involving Slovakia Category:Antiziganism in Slovakia Category:Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights Category:Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights Category:Romani in Slovakia ","title":"I.G. and Others vs. Slovakia"},{"id":"37891246","text":"\\"U.F.O.\\" is a song by British rock band Coldplay.

Swindridgemuir area Brigadier-General Neill Rabbie's Well Wood at the Middlebank Plantation The Bombo Burn runs under the nearby road at the Swindridgemuir Bridge and this road continues past Kerslochmuir Farm and the settlement at Bellstone Cottages. Johnson's 1828 map gives the local names as Bowtrapping, Lochmuir, and Belstane. Robert Burns John Smith of Swindridgemuir relates in a letter of 1829 that Dr Mackenzie was present with him at a social occasion at Robertland, hosted by Sir William Cunningham, at which Robert Burns was present. A discussion took place about the identity of Tam o'Shanter during which the poet revealed that one Douglas Grahame was the individual upon whom Tam was modelled.Dalry Burns Club Retrieved : 2012-12-10 The origin of the name Rabbie's Well and Rabbie's Brae below West Middlebank Farm is unknown. Relatives of Robert Burns' friend John Davidson, his 'Souter Johnnie', once lived at High Swindridgemuir Farm and donated a cup and saucer that once belonged to him to the Irvine Burns Club. Micro-history The Neills of Barnweil were descended from the MacNeills of Barra who had settled in Ayrshire circa 1550. In 1826 John Smith was the Grand Master of the Kilwinning Mother Lodge. A memorial at Barnweill Church to Col J W Neil Smith of Barnweill and Swindridgemuir also bears the details of his wife Evelyn Mary Mapis Duke who died on June 21, 1940. 'Tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner' is carved on this stone and on a smaller wooden cross that bears her details alone. A public path exists at the High Swindridgemuir Wood.

In the past two decades, NECC has played a significant role for the betterment of the poultry industry in general, and the egg industry in particular, through its various programmes like market intervention, price support operations, egg promotion campaigns, consumer education, market research, rural market development and liaisons with the government on vital issues concerning the industry Objectives NECC has vast objectives to play significant role in Indian Egg industry which mainly focus on Egg Pricing. After fulfilling its original purpose NECC expanded its scope of activities to achieve the following. *On bases of reasonable price for customer, decent margin for middleman and fair return to farmer, it declares the egg Price. *Monitoring, managing, regulating the stocks from surplus to deficit regions *Market intervention through Agrocorpex India Limited. *Having a dependable and close network of marketeers that use multi level marketing to sell the products. *Promote egg trade, egg farm, egg exports . *Make available the technology and information for increased production of eggs. History The Indian Poultry industry suffered an unusual series of crises in early 1980s, as the selling price had become lower than the production cost. Many of the poultry farmers shut down their farm operations as a result of heavy losses. A group of farmers motivated by Dr. B. V. Rao and Ch. Jagapati Rao traveled across the country, organizing over 300 meetings with groups, individuals, and traders. Their objective was to unite poultry farmers from all over India and take control of their own destiny. In May 1982, NECC was formally registered as a trust under the Indian Societies Registration Act and on May 14, 1982, NECC started declaring egg prices.

Taking place yearly at the Palais des Congr√®s in the heart of Paris, it aims at giving the students a first perception of the career prospect offered by their diploma. Over 3200 students participate every year to meet about 190 companies and several partner universities from all around the world. It remains one of the most important job fairs organised by French engineering schools (Grandes √âcoles) and amongst the biggest in Europe. Past activities √âcole Centrale Paris and Sup√©lec are amongst the most prestigious engineering schools in France. They offer multidisciplinary curriculum for engineers, including scientific, engineering and management education. Since December 2008, a strategic alliance was announced between the two schools, known today through the common brand of CentraleSup√©lec. The merge between the job fairs organized independently in each one of the schools (the Forum Centrale Entreprises and the Forum Sup√©lec) was brought to fruition in 2010. Since then, it has given rise to three events at the Palais des Congr√®s. CentraleSup√©lec International openness Ecole Centrale Paris and Sup√©lec are known for their international ties, and several international companies and partner foreign universities take part in the Forum Centrale-Sup√©lec. It is an opportunity for companies to present their international careers and business activities to the students. Since 2011 the Forum Centrale-Sup√©lec has been part of the ECFA (European Career Forums Alliance), of which the Forum Centrale Entreprises was a founding member. This alliance has allowed teams organising fairs in different European countries to share their know-how and experiences and to improve their overall quality. Key figures The third edition of the Forum Centrale-Sup√©lec has gathered 180 companies, including 86 √âcole Centrale Paris or Sup√©lec partners, and several CAC 40 firms. 16 universities contributed to the Forum, and one stand was occupied by the Administration of √âcole Centrale Paris and Sup√©lec in charge of international mobility. Among the 3200 students who attended the Forum Centrale-Sup√©lec in 2012, 75% were from √âcole Centrale Paris or Sup√©lec ; 15% were studying master's degree at either engineering school, 5% were researchers and the last 5% were alumni students. In the day the Forum Centrale-Sup√©lec takes place, about 90 students work on its organisation. Provided services to students  Three weeks before the Forum, each school organises training activities to prepare the students for the event. Members of human resources from participating companies are invited to help. Activities include lectures on how to write a CV, job interview simulation in French and English, case studies, brainteasers, etc. Closing conference The event concludes with a conference in the auditorium of the Palais des Congr√®s held by a CEO of a large European industrial company. The Forum Centrale-Sup√©lec has welcomed: * Mr. Gallois, ex-CEO of EADS, in 2010. * Mr. Mestrallet, CEO of GDF Suez, in 2011. * Mr de Margerie, CEO of Total, in 2012. * Mr. Herteman, CEO of Safran, in 2013. * Mr. L√©vy, CEO of Thales, in 2014. * Mr. Oud√©a, CEO of Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, in 2015.

At the latter, he met Italian architect and designer Gaetano Pesce, who became an important influence on his work. Fitch worked with Pesce for the next three years in Venice, making models of visionary buildings and contributing to international design competitions. Interior design In the late 80s, Fitch emerged as an architectural designer. He designed several houses, interiors, and pieces of furniture. In 1986, with collaborator Ross Miller, he designed the home of art dealer/collector Meredyth Moses. First published in the Boston Globe, it was revisited by Metropolis ten years later. Fitch continued to design private residences and in 1989, he also co-founded Ooloo, a company specializing in one-of-a-kind art furniture that he made with artisans in the Philippines. Ooloo furniture was featured in galleries in the US, Europe, and Japan. The company also produced products for the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim, Barney's, Henry Bendell, and many other institutions. His time in the Philippines led to an assignment by the government there to become the 1997 International Design Consultant for Gifts and Housewares exports. An article appeared about this work in Metropolis. Meanwhile, Fitch continued to work in the theater, mainly as a set designer for the Seattle Repertory Theater. He also wrote, directed, and designed a series of experimental shows in the Boston area, including The Potluck Supper, The Sweating Fire Alarm, and The Sweating Door Alarm. A chance meeting with Mimi Oka led to the creation of Orphicorps and a series of Orphic Feasts that eventually culminated in a French-English bilingual book called Orphic Fodder Upon his return to the US Fitch moved to New York, where together with Oka, he created two major events with the Asia Society, the Edible Still Life in Clay and Good Taste in Art. Many other events followed in Japan, France, New York, Santa Fe, Portugal, and the Czech Republic. In 1999, Alan Gilbert hired Fitch to design and construct the interior of his New York apartment. This led to an ongoing series of music-based projects with Gilbert. Fitch also designed an innovative interior for violinist Joshua Bell's home. A New York Times article published in 2003 about Fitch's design caught the attention of Uli Bader, then the artistic director of the National Symphony Orchestra, who invited Fitch to create a series of concert theatre productions at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC: L'enfant et les sortil√®ges, Swan Lake, and The Abduction from the Seraglio. Fitch's collaboration with agent Linde Trottenberg, founder of Multi Art International, led to several art exhibitions and installations all over in Germany. The first of these was entitled Organs of Emotion and was held in the Center for Epileptic Research in Bonn. The entire show of drawings was purchased by a pharmaceutical company and toured throughout Germany. Another exhibition, called Mit Haut und Haaren (\\"With Skin and Hair\\"), was commissioned and was still traveling around Germany . Theatre director and designer Fitch's first collaboration with conductor Alan Gilbert was Igor Stravinsky's The Soldier's Tale at the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival soon followed by Das Rheingold at the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic. In 2005, Fitch directed and designed the set for Turandot, at the Santa Fe Opera. In 2006, he directed, designed the costumes and sets and choreographed a new production of Hansel and Gretel for the Los Angeles Opera. In the summer of 2006, Fitch directed and designed the sets for the American premiere of Elliott Carter's only opera, What Next?, conducted by James Levine, at Tanglewood. The show was filmed by Kitao Sakurai and shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Giants Are Small In 2005, Fitch was invited by violinist Pinchas Zukerman to create a production of The Soldier's Tale at Lincoln Center, New York, featuring principal players from the New York Philharmonic. Actor F. Murray Abraham was the narrator, Marian Seldes voiced the Devil, and Tim Blake Nelson played the soldier. This project would herald the beginning of Fitch's collaboration with Swiss producer and filmmaker Edouard Getaz. The show itself featured a miniature theater populated with hundreds of two-dimensional paper puppets and was all filmed live. What was captured on camera was simultaneously projected on a screen above the musicians. The show was repeated at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, Canada, leading to the development of live animation: a concept merging film and theater in a unique way by making a spectacle out of the making of the film on stage. After two years of experimental development, Fitch, Getaz, and multimedia entrepreneur Frederic Gumy co-founded the theatre and entertainment company Giants Are Small. In 2008, Giants Are Small created an adaptation of Peter and the Wolf, which combined live animation and live music played by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. A prequel extended the original story to an hour-long adventure, situated in contemporary Los Angeles, which was underscored by excerpts from a number of other symphonic works. ranging from Shostakovitch to Gershwin. The show was presented at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. In 2010, Giants Are Small created a production of Gy√∂rgy Ligeti's absurdist opera Le Grand Macabre with the New York Philharmonic, directed by Doug Fitch (who also designed the set), conducted by Alan Gilbert and produced by Edouard Getaz. The production, which was sold out before it opened, was elected \\"Best Opera of the Year\\" by the New York Times, the New York Magazine, and TimeOut NY. The production featured a cast that included Eric Owens, Melissa Parks, Barbara Hannigan, Anthony Roth Costanzo, and Mark Schowalter. Costumes were designed by Catherine Zuber and the lighting was designed by Clifton Taylor. Giants Are Small's live animation was created from drawings and designs by Fitch. The show was presented at Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center. In 2011, Giants Are Small and the New York Philharmonic paired again to present a new production of Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's The Cunning Little Vixen, directed by Fitch (who also designed the costumes and co-designed the set with Skip Mercier), conducted by Gilbert, and produced by Getaz. The show was choreographed by Karole Armitage and featured a large cast, including Isabel Bayrakdarian, Alan Opie, Melissa Parks, and the Metropolitan Opera Children's Chorus. The production was designated \\"Best Classical Performance of the Year 2011\\" by New York Magazine. The show was presented at Avery Fisher Hall. On February 22, 2012, Giants Are Small and the New York Philharmonic announced a new collaboration, A Dancer's Dream, featuring Igor Stravinsky's ballets Fairy's Kiss and Petrushka, conducted by Gilbert, directed and designed by Fitch, and video directed and produced by Getaz, in June 2013 at Avery Fisher Hall. The show was partially based on a version developed in 2008 at the University of Maryland, directed by Fitch in collaboration with conductor James Ross. Early in 2013, Giants Are Small announced that the show would also comprise one excerpt of Louis Durey's Neige. New York City Ballet's Sara Mearns was the star ballerina, representing various characters throughout the show, in a choreography by Armitage. The production features a mix of music, live filmmaking and puppetry, and ballet.

He is best known for originating the concept of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) with a few other colleagues and has been referred to as one of the 'founding fathers' of the project. CMS is a world-wide collaboration which started in 1991 and now has over 3500 participants from 45 countries. Virdee was elected Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Institute of Physics (IOP) in 2012. In recognition of his work on CMS he has been awarded the IOP High Energy Particle Physics group prize (2007) and the IOP Chadwick Medal and Prize (2009). In 2012, he was awarded the 2013 Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for 'leadership in the scientific endeavour that led to the discovery of the new Higgs-like particle by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) along with 6 other physicists. Virdee plans to use the money to support science in schools in Sub-Saharan Africa‚Äîsee He was awarded the 2013 European Physical Society High Energy and Particle Physics Prize and the 2017 American Physical Society Panofsky Prize for his pioneering work and outstanding leadership in the making of the CMS experiment. In 2020 he was awarded the Blaise Pascal Medal of the European Academy of Sciences in Physics. In 2014, Virdee was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to science. Early life and education Tejinder Virdee was born in 1952 to Udham Kaur and Chain Singh Virdee in Nyeri, Kenya. Virdee went to school in Kisumu at the Kisumu Boys High School. Due to the prevailing circumstances in Kenya at the time, his family (of Indian Sikh origin) emigrated in 1967 to Birmingham, England. He credits part of his interest in physics to Howard Stockley, his physics teacher at King's Norton Boys' School, Birmingham, whom he describes as an 'inspirational teacher'. He also remembers visiting Birmingham Museum of Science and Industry, where he stumbled across a cloud chamber sparking his interest in the study of the structure of matter. Virdee obtained a B.Sc. in Physics from Queen Mary College, University of London in 1974. Research career After completing his Ph.D. at Imperial College London, on an experiment conducted at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in California, he joined CERN in 1979 as a Fellow of the Experimental Physics Division. Virdee‚Äôs early scientific career (1979-1984) involved verifying the strange notion that the ‚Äúquarks‚Äù (the constituents of the protons the neutrons and all other hadrons) carry fractional electric charge. This was successfully demonstrated by the NA14 photoproduction experiment at CERN in the mid-eighties. Following NA14 he joined the UA1 experiment at CERN's proton-antiproton collider (SPS) where his interest in high-performance calorimetry was developed, leading to his invention of a novel technique of collecting light in plastic scintillator- based calorimeters. Towards the end of UA1, (1990) Virdee, with a few other colleagues, started planning an experiment based on a high field solenoid that would be able to identify the missing elements of the Standard Model (SM) and also to probe in full the physics of the TeV scale. This was to become the CMS experiment at the LHC, one of the most complex instruments science has ever seen. Since 1991 Virdee has played a crucial role in all phases of CMS. Over the last two decades this has covered conceptual design, intensive R&D;, prototyping, construction, installation, commissioning, data-taking and finally physics exploitation. He has been the driving force behind many of the major technology decisions made in CMS, especially the selection of the calorimeter technologies. The CMS hadron calorimeter uses the technique he had invented earlier. The possibility of discovering a Higgs-like boson played a crucial role in the conceptual design of CMS, and served as a benchmark to test the performance of the experiment. In 1990 Virdee and a colleague, Christopher Seez, carried out the first detailed simulation studies of the most plausible way to detect the SM Higgs boson in the low-mass region in the environment of the LHC: via its decay into two photons. Understanding that dense scintillating crystals offer arguably the best possibility of achieving excellent energy resolution, Virdee made a compelling case for the use of lead tungstate scintillating crystals (PbWO4) for the electromagnetic calorimeter of CMS and then led the team that proved the viability of this technique, a technique that has played a crucial role in the discovery of the new heavy boson, in July 2012. Virdee was deeply involved in this search for the Higgs boson, especially via its two-photon decay mode. Virdee was the deputy project leader of CMS between 1993 and 2006 and was then elected project leader (Spokesperson) in January 2007 for a period of three years. He oversaw the final stages of construction, installation and data taking with the first collisions at the LHC. Virdee is a major voice in arguing for the long-term future of the LHC accelerator and its experiments. An increase in the interaction rate by almost a factor of around ten is being advocated for the CMS and ATLAS experiments. To benefit fully from this luminosity increase the CMS detector will be upgraded. Virdee is leading efforts to replace the detector's endcaps with a novel silicon-based technology that measures the energy and momentum of particles to unprecedented levels of precision. Beyond his contributions to particle physics he is a promoter of science and education, especially in Africa. He funds science-related education activities in schools and universities in Africa, India and the United Kingdom. Invited lectures and outreach Virdee has given several keynote speeches at international conferences, opening or closing addresses at particle physics conferences and public lectures on the LHC Project. These include the 2007 Schr√∂dinger Lecture, the 2012 Peter Lindsay Lectures at Imperial College, the 16th Kaczmarczik Lecture at Drexel University, Philadelphia in 2011, the Keynote Speech at the 2009 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, Reno, USA and joint lectures on the LHC Project with Prof. Edward Witten in Philadelphia, U.S.A.

Common names are numerous and include Wyjeelah, Nepine, Split Jack, Nipang Creeper, Nipan, Native Orange and Bush Caper. Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle described Capparis lasiantha in his 1824 work Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis, and it still bears its original name. It was originally published by Robert Brown who did not give enough detail in his description to distinguish it from other species. This was later done by de Candolle, and hence the correct name is Capparis lasiantha R.Br. ex DC. with both botanists treated as authors. The seedlings and young plants begin life as climbing vines that cling to the host plants by means sharp spines on the stems. Some plants may retain this climbing form into maturity, while others go on to develop into a scrambling shrub up to 3 m (10 ft) in height. Mature plants produce large, white perfumed flowers which are followed by hard, round fruit 2 ‚Äì 4 cm in diameter. Upon ripening the fruit becomes soft and fragrant, eventually splitting to reveal a sweet, edible pulp surrounding the seed. The fruit was used as food by Aboriginal people throughout its range. A concoction from the bark was used as a treatment for animal bites and stings in the Broome region. Farmers could use the leaves as fodder for livestock in periods of drought. Caterpillars of the caper white (Belenois java) feed on its leaves. Capparis lasiantha has been recorded as a host for the mistletoe species Lysiana subfalcata. A drought tolerant plant, Capparis lasiantha can be grown in arid or subtropical gardens, its heavy flowering and edible fruit give it horticultural potential. It can be propagated by seed.

The company's current board chairman is Mohamed Moheb Salah Elden. Egypt's largest industrial facility, Misr Helwan employs over 25,000 workers, many of whom have played an active role in Egyptian labor struggles. Large protests and strikes at Misr Helwan since 2006 contributed to the collapse of the Mubarak government, the 2011 Egyptian revolution, and the Arab Spring more generally. Development Growth of the Egyptian cotton industry King Fouad I visits the Misr Spinning and Weaving Company, also known as Misr Helwan, in El-Mahalla El-Kubra, Egypt. The company owns the largest factory in Egypt, today employing over 25,000 workers. The Misr Spinning and Weaving Company was founded in 1927 by a group of Egyptian businessmen in collaboration with the Misr Bank, facing Mahalla‚Äôs Tal‚Äòat Harb Square in El-Mahalla El-Kubra. The bank, which had formed during the Egyptian uprising of 1920 and proclaimed itself to be \\"an Egyptian Bank for Egyptians only,\\" began providing capital for large-scale Egyptian industrial facilities and considered Misr Spinning and Weaving to be its flagship enterprise. Egyptian economist Talaat Harb was one of those who helped establish the firm. Misr Helwan was largely staffed by workers from peasant backgrounds, many of whom worked temporarily to save and return money to their families. Long- staple cotton had been invented in Cairo in the 1820s, becoming a staple of the Egyptian economy in the 19th and 20th Centuries. Cotton production used 2.1 million acres for cultivation after the Second World War and by the 1980s represented the second largest export in Egypt, after crude oil. Cotton production in Egypt nevertheless declined after its post-WWII peak as arable land was converted to cereal or clover production, and previous importers including India achieved cotton self-sufficiency. In 1960, Misr Helwan was the first firm to be nationalized by Gamal Abdel Nasser. It began to diversity its cotton sources and products, and in 1975 established a garment unit to complement its cloth manufactory. In 1976, the United States Agency for International Development contributed $96 million in loans to the Egyptian government, intended to help further modernize the Misr company. The loan caused controversy among American textile manufacturers, faced with losses as global textile markets expanded. In the 1990s, solar heat increasingly used in dye and bleaching saved the textile company 11,000 barrels of oil annually, according to Egypt's New and Renewable Energy Authority. Efforts to private Misr Helwan, and Misr Fine Spinning and Weaving in Kafr el-Dawwar, were blocked by strike actions at both facilities. Misr Helwan in the 21st Century The Nile River Delta in 2010, Egypt's major population center, which includes the industrial city of El-Mahalla El-Kubra and Egypt's largest industrial facility, Misr Helwan. In 2004, the company employed 23,000 workers and exported 46,000 tons of cotton yarn, 150 million square meters of fabric, and 5 million garments annually. In 2005, it employed 26,000 workers, and company facilities included 8 spinning mills, 10 weaving factories, processing units and labs, and recreational centers. The company remained nationalized despite largescale liberalization of other sectors of the Egyptian economy. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, Misr Helwan entered into $21 million in debt, which the Egyptian State News Service stated it was able to reduce to $16 million in debt the subsequent year through a debt settlement program. Misr Helwan currently sells approximately 70% of its production to domestic markets, with the remaining production sold primarily to Europe. Early labor struggles The earliest efforts to unionize Misr Helwan workers were led by the radical Abbas Halim, a member of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty and veteran of the German and Turkish armies during the First World War. While these efforts failed, Misr Helwan workers nevertheless organized strike activities themselves, demanding in July 1938 that they be granted eight-hour workdays, and in 1947 that they work under more lenient disciplinary rules. During the 1947 strike, the Egyptian government brought tanks into Mahalla, killing three workers and injuring 17 more. It was not until 1948 that workers achieved eight-hour days, following a government commission responding to strike pressure. Strikes were again suppressed by the army under Nasser in August 1952. Due to low capital investment in Egypt's textile industry, the proportion of textile workers in Egypt's workforce began declining in 1960, and absolute numbers were declining by 1976. While wages initially increased following nationalization, wages began declining in the 1970s under Anwar al- Sadat. Following structural adjustments mandated by the World Bank during the 1990s, Egyptian textile manufacturing wages declined more precipitously, making them among the lowest of any textile manufacturers on earth as of the mid 2000s. In May 1975, workers from Misr Helwan, still the Middle East's largest spinning and weaving plant, demonstrated against high costs of living. Many workers were veterans of the 1973 Yom Kippur War and expected better treatment following their service in the Egyptian army. On May 21 Egyptian security forces killed one protester, injured others, and arrested 40-50; police requestioned two agricultural engineers who they alleged had incited workers to protest. The Misr Helwan workers earned $12.50 a week; Egyptian Interior Ministry officials stated that workers had burned cotton shipments and looted the homes of company executives. During this period, in order to organize labor activity, Misr Helwan workers created a political organization of several hundred members called Fagr (Dawn), and published a digest of the same name. In September 1984 a sit-in strike at the Misr Company over government-mandated price increases and declining wages led to a general strike in El-Mahalla and surrounding towns. The strike forced Mubarak to return the cost of flat bread in working class districts to one penny, a subsidy then costing the government $400 million annually. Between 1986-88, workers struck demanding an increase in wages from $26 to $30 monthly, and placed an image of Mubarak in a coffin outside the factory walls; government response was severe. 2004-9 strikes In 2003, Egypt passed a Unified Labor Law effectively outlawing strikes, by prohibiting labor actions not authorized by the General Federation of Egyptian Trade Unions, itself run by the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP). Workers at Misr Helwan nevertheless struck on several occasions prior to the fall of the Mubarak government. Low wages and rising food costs lead to strikes A strike at Misr Helwan in December 2006 prompted a nationwide strike centered on pay, living conditions, and market reforms. Workers in March 2006 had made concessions to the management accepting 45 rather than 60 days of bonus pay, in exchange for profit sharing in the event of profits beyond an agreed upon threshold. Workers decided to return to strikes in December after Misr Helwan reported over $30 million in profits, while giving only 20 days bonus pay, less than agreed upon under any condition. The December 2006 strike was initiated when 3,000 female garment workers left their stations chanting \\"Here are the women! Where are the men?\\" prompting male workers to join them. Workers, initially surrounded and confronted by security forces, were joined by 20,000 additional workers, elementary school pupils, and students from Mahalla, forcing security forces to back down. Workers then demanded the impeachment of union officials. From 2006-2007, while basic foodstuff prices increased by 48% and Misr Helwan reported profits of $120, many Misr workers were paid only $27 monthly, with some paid as little as $18 monthly. On September 23, 2007 approximately 20-27,000 workers from Misr went on strike, demanding higher pay and better working conditions. Workers and their families held rallies, threatened to create an independent administration, and demanded the resignation of Textile Holding Company head Mohsen al-Jilany, Misr Helwan chairman Mahmoud al-Gibali, and the dismissal of the workers' syndicate council head. They furthermore denied any relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood and stated that any implied links were intended to represent their fight over rights as a security risk. Government security forces surrounded and confined striking workers with their families, and arrested 5-8 trade unionists, accusing them of \\"unlawful gathering\\" and \\"destruction of public properties.\\" According to government officials, police feared that the strike would spread to other major manufacturing centers throughout Egypt, as occurred in 2006. Misr Helwan spokesmen stated that the company suffered losses of $1.8 million on the first day of the strike. The company management reportedly refused negotiations with strikers in early days of the strike, and Egyptian Labour Minister Aisha Abdel Hadi, along with the government-controlled General Federation for Textile Workers, declared the strike illegal. The company subsequently promised to meet many of the workers' demands, ending the strike after one week. Failed April 6, 2008 strike Faced with municipal elections largely ignored by the population of Mahalla and still rising food prices, Misr Helwan workers promised to strike on April 6, 2008, demanding higher pay. but police response including arrests, occupation of Misr Helwan facilities and intimidation initially prevented them from doing so; a strike would have been illegal unless sanctioned by the ruling National Democratic Party. Nevertheless, Misr Halwan workers and others throughout El-Mahalla El-Kubra fought with police, set fire to schools, cars and tires, destroyed a portrait of Hosni Mubarak, and stormed the city hall. 300 people were injured in the first two days of rioting, and one youth fatally shot by police; two more later died as well. The Egyptian government offered concessions to Misr Helwan workers of 30 days bonus pay, and sent prime minister Ahmed Nazif to negotiate with them. Among those arrested in the April strikes was Kareem el-Beheiri, a Misr Helwan worker and organizer of previous strikes, whose arrest sparked concern and condemnation from Reporters Without Borders. Later released by Egyptian authorities, el-Beheiri and fellow Misr Helwan workers Tarek Amin and Kamal al-Fayoumy told the Agence France Presse that they had been subjected to beatings, electric shocks and starvation during their 76 days of confinement. Police reportedly sought to block the publicizing of workers conditions and planned protests via blogs and Facebook groups, and arrested Ahmed Maher after he created the Facebook \\"6 April\\" group supporting the Misr Helwan workers. In September 2009, 1,500 Misr Helwan workers demanding unpaid wages went on strike and took company executives hostage. Strikes during and after the Egyptian Revolution Protesters on 10 February 2011 in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Misr Helwan workers struck in solidarity with the pro-democracy protests and continued their strike after Mubarak's fall, demanding higher wages. Collapse of the Mubarak government In February 2011 Misr Helwan workers closed the factory and went on strike in solidarity with protestors in Tahrir Square. After the fall of Mubarak's government, Misr Helwan workers briefly ceased but then continued strike action, demanding higher wages. Workers also demanded the replacement of company officials, as the Egyptian Supreme Council for the Armed Forces called on the workers to return to work. With a tank stationed outside the company's main gate, workers also called for reforms within the country's military. Misr Helwan workers also demanded the resignation of the state-controlled Egyptian Trade Union Federation leadership. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces threatened strikers, declaring that the military \\"will not allow the continuation of these illegal acts which pose a danger to the nation, and they will confront them.\\". Following threats, the military acceded to strike demands and Misr Helwan workers returned to the factory. Subsequent strikes On 15 July 2012, American Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with Egyptian Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi and praised the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces for \\"representing the Egyptian people in the revolution.\\" On the same day, 25,000 workers from Misr Helwan went on strike demanding increased profit sharing, better retirement benefits and a replacement of the management. Some strikers argued that the revolution had not materially benefitted Misr Helwan workers, and had rather promoted \\"corrupt\\" officials such as Fouad Abd-al- Alim. The Misr workers were joined by workers from seven other textile factories in the region, and strikes also broke out among doctors and health workers, university workers, and ceramics workers in other parts of Egypt. Workers suspended their strike on 24 July, having seen only some of their demands met, and promised to strike again in September unless further concessions were made. Declaration of independence from the \\"Muslim Brotherhood State\\" Violent clashes broke out in Mahalla on November 27, 2012 over the constitution proposed by the Muslim Brotherhood; some Misr Helwan workers participating in the protest stated that they did not participate in an attack on the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party headquarters. On December 7 protesters in El-Mahalla El-Kubra stormed the city hall and declared independence from the \\"Muslim Brotherhood State.\\" One Misr Helwan worker, arrested on previous occasions by the Mubarak government, explained workers' attitudes to the Muslim brotherhood: > The revolution's slogan was \\"Justice, bread and freedom,\\" but we've obtained > none of these. The government just increased the price of electricity by 15% > while our wages have stagnated. They're now trying to impose a > discriminatory constitution, written for and by Islamists. The Muslim > Brotherhood doesn't represent me... they take with one hand what they > pretend to give with the other. They're even worse than Mubarak.\\" Other protestors noted that Misr Helwan workers could launch a general strike, slowing or crippling the national economy. One worker speaking to Al-Ahram criticized the constitution, stating that article 14 tied wages to production and not food prices. Voting in Mahalla was largely peaceful on the day of the election. Reign of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi After the overthrow of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi by general Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat, the Egyptian government passed laws raising the minimum wage to 1,200 EGP per month. In February 2014, 13,000 Misr Helwan workers, some earning only 500 EGP per month, began a sit-down strike demanding the implementation of minimum wages. Workers also demanded unpaid bonuses. In April Egypt's Higher Administrative Court ruled that public sector employees who strike can be prosecuted, prompting clashes between Misr Helwan workers and Egyptian security forces. In June, the Sisi government called on workers to stop all strikes, and increase productivity. Some Misr Helwan workers stated that mismanagement had brought productivity to 50% of capacity through failure to provide adequate raw materials for production. Misr Helwan employees stated that their wages still remained below minimum wage. In October 2015 Egyptian authorities declared that they would no longer provide promised and as-yet unpaid bonuses to employees, prompting another strike by 17,000 Misr Helwan workers, soon joined by workers in associated industries. The bonuses were meant to help with surging inflation. In response to the strike Egyptian labor minister Gamal Sorour threatened workers with prosecution \\"against any attempts to obstruct work.\\" A labor rights director in Egypt stated that the Egyptian government canceled bonuses in an effort to reduce pay to all public sector employees except those in the Interior Ministry, armed forces, judiciary and banks. According to another analyst, the Egyptian government was allowing the workforce to shrink and lowering payroll costs to privatize the company. When workers ignored the ultimatum, the government announced it would extend bonuses to some workers, but not to those at Misr Helwan, unless the company regained profits lost in the strike. When workers remained on strike, the government promised they would extend bonuses to Misr Helwan employees as well, ending the strike. The company announced however that it would deduct 11 days of wages from salaries in retaliation for the strike. In 2015, Egyptian Sumo wrestler and Misr Helwan employee, Ramy Abd El Aty Ibrahim Belalal-Gazzar, became the world Sumo wrestling champion at the annual US Sumo Open. Gazzar is a maintenance worker at the company and also coaches its Judo team. Significance The Misr Spinning and Weaving Company is considered Egypt's largest company and industrial facility; 48% of Egypt's economy involves the textile industry. Since its creation in 1927 and through successive stages of development and governance, Misr Helwan has been considered at the forefront not only of Egypt's industrial development but also its political and labor activity. Al Jazeera has called the factory \\"a microcosm of Egyptian society.\\" Textile workers at Misr Helwan and at other facilities in Kafr el-Dawwar, Qalyub, Helwan and Shubra al-Khayma played major roles in nationwide Egyptian strike actions beginning in 1977, with the U.S.-backed liberalization of the Egyptian economy. Resisting nationwide trends, workers at Misr Helwan rejected privatization in Mahalla and encouraged workers at other public facilities to do the same. The company's failed 6 April 2008 strike inspired Egypt's April 6 Youth Movement that ultimately played a significant role in Egypt's Arab Spring and the collapse of the Mubarak government. Writing for The Majalla, Paula Mejia has written that Misr Helwan's strikes \\"not only voiced the grievances of many Egyptians, but they also provided them with a solution: collective action for government response.\\" Misr Helwan workers considered themselves to be at the vanguard of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, and continued to fight for improved working conditions after Mubarak's fall. The World Socialist Web Site has argued that the strike called by Misr Helwan workers in the early days of February 2011 prevented further compromise between government and opposition groups, contributing to Mubarak's departure.

Fossils have been found in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana and the Lance Formation of Wyoming. Researchers describe it as being distinguished by its \\"tall, slender teeth with large central cusps separated from small accessory cusps by lingual grooves.\\" The type species was named Obamadon gracilis after United States president Barack Obama, \\"in reference to the tall, straight teeth, and the manner in which Mr. Obama has acted as a role model of good oral hygiene for the world.\\" According to Nicholas R. Longrich of Yale University, the creature \\"was probably a foot long, [and] with these tall, slender teeth it used to eat insects and plant matter.\\" The lizard was identified as part of a search of museum collections to find snake and lizard species that had lived immediately prior to the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, in which the dinosaurs (with the exception of birds) died out. Its identification was published by Longrich, Bhullar and Gauthier in a paper titled \\"Mass extinction of lizards and snakes at the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary\\", published on December 10, 2012 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The scientists found that lizards and snakes had been more badly hit by the mass extinction than previously thought, with 83 percent of species ‚Äì including Obamadon ‚Äì dying out. All present-day species of lizards are descended from members of the surviving 17 percent. Naming Obamadon is not the first organism to be named after U.S. President Barack Obama. Other researchers have given his name to Etheostoma obama, the spangled darter or \\"Obamafish\\", and the lichen Caloplaca obamae. Longrich denied any political intent in the nomenclature, telling Politico that \\"we're just having fun with taxonomy\\", but commented that if the 2012 United States Presidential election had gone a different way he probably would not have used the name, as \\"it might have seemed like we were mocking it, naming a lizard that goes extinct after that, seemed kind of cruel.\\" According to Longrich, he came up with the idea after the 2008 election: \\"when everything was all hope-y and change-y, we said we should name a dinosaur after him and call it the Obamadon.\\" The holotype of this taxon was documented in the original 2012 paper but not explicitly identified in the text, which meant that Obamadon was not validly named in the 2012 paper. It was designated in the correction published in 2013, validating Obamadon. Description Obamadon is known from two lower jaw fragments, each less than a centimeter in length. One was found in the collections of the University of California Museum of Paleontology after having been collected from the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, and the other collected from the Lance Formation in Wyoming. When it was first named in 2012, Obamadon was identified as a member of the extinct group Polyglyphanodontia on the basis of a V-shaped connection between the two halves of the lower jaw, a slot-and-ridge type connection between the dentary bone of the lower jaw and another missing bone called the splenial bone, and teeth that are implanted within the jaw bone. Its jaw is thin and straight, unlike the curved jaws of most other polyglyphanodontians. Obamadon is estimated to have been about 30 cm (1 foot) in length and may have preyed on insects.Campbell, Hank. Obamadon Gracilis - Toothy Lizard Named After American President, Science 2.0, October 12, 2012, Retrieved 2012-12-13 Relationships Obamadon is a primitive member of Polyglyphanodontia, a clade of lizards that became extinct after the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event.

He, along with Ferdinand de Lesseps, was a proponent of creating an inland Sahara Sea by flooding areas of the Sahara Desert which were below sea level. Early life and military career Roudaire was born into a middle-class family. His father, Fran√ßois Joseph Roudaire, was director of the Natural History Museum of Gueret. After classical studies in his hometown, Fran√ßois √âlie turned towards a scientific career in the army. He entered the Ecole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1854. In 1864, he was assigned to Algeria as an officer surveyor, given the task of creating a geodesic and topographic survey of the colony. Operating south of Biskra, in Constantine Province, he explored the region's chotts, and was one of the first to accurately measure their depth, noting that many lay below sea level. Proposal of a Sahara Sea Having discovered many locations far below sea level (up to ), Roudaire became convinced that a vast depression once extended to the salty Gulf of Gab√®s and corresponded to a geographic feature known at the time of Herodotus as Lake Tritonis (also known as the Bay of Triton). In an article written for the Revue des Deux Mondes in 1874, titled \\"An inland sea in Algeria,\\" Fran√ßois √âlie Roudaire proposed to recreate the former sea by cutting a channel from the Chott el Fejej to the Gulf of Gab√®s. He argued that the mass of water would allow water transport, as well as significantly alter the climate; it would turn the arid region of the Sahara into one of considerably greater fertility. Ferdinand de Lesseps, who was instrumental in the creation of the Suez Canal, adopted the idea along with several other writers, scholars and politicians. While there was initially general enthusiasm for the project, further surveys discovered that one of the chotts that Roudaire and de Lesseps had proposed digging a canal to was, in fact, above sea level. This reduction in floodable area (a reduction of between and ), and the cost of a channel long, caused a loss of support from within the government, leading the Public Works Minister to cancel the project in 1882. Roudaire and Ferdinand de Lesseps fell back on private funding and founded the Society for the Study of African inland sea later that year to continue their pursuit of the project. Criticism of the project from within the scientific community mounted, however, and the project was abandoned shortly before Roudaire's death in 1885.

History Acton is an unincorporated community in Acton Township, Meeker County. It's near Grove City and Litchfield. The community is located along Meeker County Road 23 near State Highway 4. County Road 32 is also nearby. A post office called Acton was established in 1857 with Peter Ritchie as the postmaster, and it remained in operation until 1904, but the community wasn't really organized into a village or township until April 1858. It was named after Acton, Ontario, Canada, where the Peter Ritchie family came from, when they settled in the area in 1857. (Peter was born in about 1831 in Canada.) Peter was counted in the September 21, 1857 census as living in Township 119 (Acton). Also in 1857, Robinson Jones, Howard Baker and his mother, and Abram Kelley settled there. Capt. George W. Robinson and John Blackwell came about the same time also. Besides Blackwell, the rest had all met in a lumber camp on the upper Mississippi in the previous winter.

Four Mdowakantons (‚Äúdwellers at the spirit waters‚Äù) from Rice Creek Village in the Lower Sioux Agency, returning home from an unsuccessful hunt, had a confrontation with Robinson Jones, a settler. The result of the dispute was that the Mdowakantons shot and killed five settlers, including Jones. That started what was called the Indian War, the Sioux Uprising, and other names. On September 3, a 55-man company of the newly-formed 10th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment was routed by a band of Dakota warriors near Acton. Led by Capt. Richard Strout, the regiment managed to break free and was pursued eight miles to Hutchinson. Six of the soldiers were killed and 23 wounded.

History  Its creator, Philippe Picquier, founded his own publishing company despite not knowing any Asian language. He currently still serves as the company's CEO. He decided to venture into the publishing industry after a chance meeting: \\" publishing is like life, everything is question of meetings [...] and a real publishing house, that is that : a permanent meeting place. \\" Choosing originally on Chinese literature and Japanese, he widened his literary horizon field in East Asia then, with the idea that \\"Asia is huge enough so that we take care only of it.‚Äù On the other hand, the house doesn‚Äôt stick to a specific domain, proposing at once literature, human sciences, essays, children's literature, comic strip, beautiful books..., because it is in question for the publisher ‚Äúto create links between the genres \\". It is addressed at a time to an adult public, and to a younger public made up of teenagers and children. The √âditions Philipe Picquier is distributed in France by Harmonia Mundi which sells especially their works in the sale agency Harmonia Mundi in Paris.

Catalog  Philippe Picquier accepts all the genres if they are relative at Asia. The house proposes from now on about 1210 titles in catalog, on account of 50 titles by year. The backlist contains more than 350 works in paperback. Whether it is at the youth backlist, or at the adult backlist, the √âditions Philippe Picquier care a lot at its book covers. The iconographic search is made by one famous designer, Dominique Picquier, the sister of Philippe Picquier. Her book covers guarantee a catalog coherence, and give meaning to the editorial policy. The images are always relative at Asia, oscillating between modernity and antiquity. According to the works, book covers illustrate them of Japanese or Chinese embossements, of photos more recent putting in scene persons of Asian origin. Adult Domain Adult collections is based on a department dedicated to human sciences proposing works of theology, documentaries, historical, ethnological, dealing with the sociological news. They offer in particular studies of the life, of the behavior and of the civilization of these countries. In another domain, beautiful books are also present, to art books such as photography and painting at cookbooks. Among graphic arts, the house proposes from now on comic strips and manga. Through the essays, the writers try to study literature, art, the Asian thought, and their history to offer to the reader the aesthetics of the thought, of the philosophy and of the Asian culture. At the literature level, the house catalog offers to the reader a huge choice, novels (literary or popular), crime novels, historical novel ... The √âditions Philippe Picquier also developed a domain dedicated to eroticism, strongly illustrated and informed in a collection named \\" Du pavillon des corps curieux \\". They also leave a beautiful part to tales, often relative to classics, as well as short story of all kinds: fantasy, eroticism, crime writing and ... poetry. Through biographies and testimonies, they are all the strong personalities of writers who express themselves, going to certain countries like China at a certain shape of liberation of the censorship. Youth Domain\\" In 2003, the √âditions Philippe Picquier creates a youth catalog named \\"Picquier Jeunesse\\". ‚ÄúTales, poetry, illustrated book, childhood and teen narratives, at youngs to the teenagers, to laugh or think, to question or have fun, they also show the reader and culture vitality. Here is thus a new collection of books to pass through the borders to the children and to discover Asia with new eyes.‚Äù So, the house enlarges it readership proposing illustrated books, novels and saga in several volumes for the olders. It is a question for the house of reach the most possible domains so as to give at the reader the best overview of Asian culture.  Authors  The √âditions Philippe Picquier works with a whole series of diverse origins: Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Japanese like Edogawa Ranpo and Seich≈ç Matsumoto, Indians, Koreans, Indonesians reflecting the Asian cultural diversity that the house tries to make known.

It was built in 1927 for Harry and Dell Calthorpe. Harry Calthorpe was a partner in Calthorpe and Woodger, a successful Queanbeyan-based stock and station and real estate agency. The house was designed by Ken Oliphant of Oakley and Parkes, the architectural firm responsible for the residence of the Prime Minister of Australia, The Lodge. Sir Charles Rosenthal had initially been selected to design the house; however, his plans were not used. Harry Calthorpe died at age 59 in 1950, and Dell Calthorpe remained in the house until her death in 1979. The house and its contents had remained largely unchanged for many years, and both the Calthorpe family and historians recognised its historical value and later, potential for a house museum. It was purchased by the Government of Australia in late 1984, and was opened as a museum in 1986. It continues to operate as a museum today. Calthorpes' House is a snapshot of domestic life for a family of four in a late 1920s three-bedroom Canberra house, however it is not entirely representative, given the larger than average house and garden, and there have been some minor changes and additions over time. There is an air raid shelter behind the house which is still preserved, and was built in response to the risk of bombing of Canberra during the war. It was added to the Australian Capital Territory Heritage Register on 27 September 1996 and to the former Register of the National Estate on 25 March 1986.

The cabinet of 15 ministers was the largest cabinet in Maltese history.Largest-ever cabinet sworn in The Malta Business Weekly, 14 March 2013 This record was again surpassed when Muscat announced a cabinet reshuffle following the appearance of Minister Konrad Mizzi's name in the Panama Papers; the new cabinet featured 16 ministers as well as the Prime Minister.Cabinet changes bloats costs by ‚Ç¨1m a year; team is largest in Malta's history Times of Malta, 7 May 2016 Mizzi was included in the new cabinet as Minister within the Office of the Prime Minister.Konrad Mizzi, Keith Schembri to remain at Castille; Mallia returns to Cabinet The Malta Independent, 28 April 2016 Prior to the 2013 elections, Muscat had pledged that the size of his Cabinet would never exceed the size of the largest Cabinet of the Fenech Adami administrations, the largest of which consisted of 13 ministers. Further to the outbreak of the Panama Papers, where the already mentioned Mizzi and Keith Schembri, the Chief of Staff within the Office of the Prime Minister were included as owners of a Panama company, together with an unnamed owner of a third company, the Maltese government was receiving copious amounts of pressure by civil society, spearheaded by blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia, but also by the Nationalist Party, especially Leader of the Opposition Simon Busuttil. Nexia BT, a Maltese audit firm, claimed ownership of Egrant. Whitehall Mansions in Ta' Xbiex, which among other tenants houses Pilatus Bank On 20 April 2017, Caruana Galizia, published a series of articles linking Joseph Muscat, Konrad Mizzi, Brian Tonna (managing partner at Nexia BT, owner of BT International, which is the sole shareholder in the Maltese Mossack Fonseca franchise). Muscat called a press conference stating that he asked for an inquiry into Caruana Galizia's claims, categorically denying any wrongdoing and labelling the allegations as \\"the biggest lie in Malta's political history\\". Around two hours later, Pilatus Bank Chairman Ali Sadr Hasheminejad, an Iranian with a St. Kitts and Nevis passport, was spotted exiting the bank with a colleague, each carrying a piece of luggage. Hasheminejad declined to give further information. Police raided Pilatus Bank on April 21, however this was deemed as being too late by the PN media since that night a \\"mysterious\\" ferry flight operated by VistaJet was en route to Baku, Azerbaijan. Further to this, PN leader Busuttil called for Muscat's resignation and announced a national demonstration against corruption, also deeming inappropriate the Police's \\"inaction\\" since the Police Commissioner was enjoying dinner in a restaurant. Michael Briguglio, an Alternattiva Demokratika politician, agreed that the Prime Minister should resign and tweeted that he would be joining the protest. On 1 May 2017 Muscat announced a snap election to take place on 3 June 2017. The announcement was made during a May Day rally organised by the Labour Party in Valletta.General election on June 3, parliament dissolved Times of Malta, 1 May 2017 The reason cited was to safeguard economic stability from the power hungry. Electoral system The Maltese voting system is a variant of proportional representation, achieved through the use of the single transferable vote, with five MPs to be returned from each of thirteen districts. The five seat electoral district system is maintained by the parties represented in the House of representatives but is not a constitutional requirement. Overall, there are 65 constituency seats, with a variable number of at-large seats (up to four) added in some cases, to ensure that the overall first-preference vote is reflected in the composition of the House of Representatives, that is, that the party with the most votes has a majority of seats.; wikipedia: Maltese general election, 1987 Participating parties Labour Party poster implying that Simon Busuttil and Marlene Farrugia disagree on proposals Moviment Patrijotti Maltin driving with loud speaker in Mƒ°arr Zaren tal-Ajkla support Eurosceptic banner in Birkirkara The Maltese political landscape is regarded as one of the most pure two-party systems of the 21st century,Wolfgang Hirczy de Mi√±o & John C. Lane (1999) Malta: STV in a two-party system and has been dominated by moderate centre-left and centre-right groups for decades; no third parties had elected MPs since the 1962 election. Six parties fielded candidates in the 2017 election, the first time since 1962 that Maltese voters had that many parties on the ballot: *The Labour Party (PL) of incumbent Prime Minister Joseph Muscat held a majority in the legislature since the 2013 election, with 38 MPs at dissolution. The Labour Party traditionally pursues social democratic ideals, and is rooted in the mainstream European centre- left. *The Nationalist Party (PN) of opposition leader Simon Busuttil is the major opposition party in parliament, with 29 MPs at dissolution. The party's last prime minister was Lawrence Gonzi, who also served as prime minister from 2004 to 2013. For much of its history, the PN has embraced conservatism and Christian democracy, as well as European integration. *The Democratic Party (PD) which was founded when Labour MP Marlene Farrugia left her party on 4 June 2016. It had 1 MP (Farrugia herself) at dissolution. On 28 April 2017, the PD formed the Forza Nazzjonali coalition with the PN. Under the agreement candidates contested the election as Nationalist candidates, with the additional descriptor \\"tal-oranƒ°jo\\", and any elected PD members would have participated in a potential Nationalist-led government. *The Democratic Alternative (AD), led by Carmel Cacopardo , is a contemporary party in Malta. It is, however, not represented in parliament.Established in 1989, the party stresses green politics and sustainable development. *Moviment Patrijotti Maltin (MPM), an offshoot of the anti-immigration group Gƒßaqda Patrijotti Maltin led by Henry Battistino which campaigns against illegal immigration, Malta's participation in the Schengen Area, and Islam in Malta. *Alleanza Bidla (AB), a conservative Christian and Eurosceptic party led by Ivan Grech Mintoff. Opinion polls Prior to the announcement of the election, opinion polls showed the Labour Party with a consistent lead over the Nationalist Party of around 5 percentage points. Opinion polls conducted during the campaign continued to show similar results. Candidates and returned MPs Below is a list of the candidates who ran in the 2017 general election; they are listed in the order used by the Maltese Electoral Commission. Party leaders are marked with an asterisk, while all candidates that successfully obtained a seat in the election, as reported by the electoral commission,Electoral Commission Malta - 2017 General Election are marked in bold.

Results Reactions Labourites celebrating in Sliema the day after the election Once preliminary results were known, Muscat claimed victory and Busuttil conceded defeat. Muscat declared the result to be an endorsement of his government's programme, stating that \\"It is clear that the people have chosen to stay the course.\\" Busuttil tendered his resignation as Nationalist Party leader, along with that of the entire administration of the Nationalist Party, following the defeat. The party began the process of selecting a new leader, which was expected to be complete by September. Despite this, leading Nationalist Robert Arrigo wrote an open letter to Busuttil imploring him to rescind his resignation. The Democratic Party celebrated the election of its leader Marlene Farrugia as their first-ever elected MP as a 'historic result'.

He spent twenty years with Fotis Gonis Express doing the top Greek work in New York and around the country, as well as Canada and Venezuela. Life Early life Besser was born on January 16, 1936, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He attended Douglas elementary school until he was seven years old and then his parents bought a large old house in Excelsior, Minnesota on Lake Minnetonka. The family had a very large garden complete with a chicken coop, which kept his mom and children busy and helped supply them with food. His father was a left-handed piano player and singer in the style of Fats Waller. His father continued to perform until he built a small grocery store at which time he put aside the music business and ran the store, together with his wife and children. Besser took piano lessons as a child but they did not take. Finally when he could not compete as an athlete (for health reasons), he took up the trumpet in his junior year in high school. Getting into music After graduation from Minnetonka High School, he went on to study privately at MacPhail College of Music. After three semesters he was offered a job in a Polka band and he spent the summer with them in western Minnesota. Besser quit the band in the fall when his dad got back into the music business, to get him a decent job. Besser went to work in a striptease club, where they taught him \\"everything he knows\\", so he says. He spent a couple of years with the strippers until he had enough money saved to move to Chicago, in 1957, to continue his studies. He studied trumpet with Arnold Jacobs and arranging with William Russo, while doing gigs with local bands. Besser left Chicago with a hotel Band and after a couple of months, when the band broke up, he moved to Los Angeles and spent a few uneventful months there. One day he got a letter from the military telling him to report for a physical. He went back to Minneapolis and failed his physical due to Asthma. He was now free to pursue his dream and travel the world. Adventures in Barcelona While living in the Devonshire Hotel in Chicago he became friendly with Jack and Phil Hand. Phil was an ex trumpet player now playing valve trombone and Jack was learning to play bass. Jack had lived in Paris during the Second world war and was a devout follower of the jazz scene. Jack Hand had moved to Spain. He wanted to start a Jazz Club there and asked Besser to join him. Besser went back to the Strip clubs to earn enough money to finance his new adventure. Besser arrived in Barcelona in February 1959. Jack had already started a record Jazz Club in a bar called \\"La Selva\\", and had built quite a big following. The owner promised he would get all necessary permits for live music. It never happened. Jack stopped paying rent and one night they arrived to find a lock on the door. Together with Besser and a large group of jazz enthusiasts, they broke the lock and put Count Basie on the record player. One or two weeks later, once again they were locked out. Finally, one night, Jack Hand and Besser decided to try it on their own. The owner was ready for them and had them beaten up by an off duty policeman and the waiters. Besser was beaten across the back and legs and Jack had his jaw broken in three places. The next day, Jack's brother Phil Hand arrived in Barcelona with his pregnant wife, Nancy. While recuperating the two brothers and Besser went to Sitges to see about the jazz scene. In April they founded a club called \\"La Galera\\" which they started to play in until June. And then back to Barcelona for some jazz gigs while searching for a new venue. From November 15, 1959 to February 15, 1960, they worked out a deal with a club called Jack's located at 48 Calle Parlamento. Jack's was doing great but without the necessary permits they were closed down by the authorities and out of work again. At that time, Jack's was the only place in Barcelona at where one could listen to live jazz music every day. The Jamboree Jazz Club At the beginning of 1960, Besser and the brothers Hand had convinced Joan Rosell√≥ to convert the basement of his bar \\"Los Tarantos\\" into a jazz club. With the help of some of the jazz followers and especially a young artist, Jordi Bon√°s, who painted magnificent jazz murals on the walls, the club started to happen with The Jazz Brothers (Hand brothers, Besser, plus the pianist Pere Ferr√© and drummer \\"Chip\\" Collins. Rosell√≥ obtained all the necessary papers and \\"The Jamboree Jazz Club\\" was born. The Jamboree did great and The Jazz Brothers developed a big following. It even appealed to the high society crowd, but the majority of the patrons were young students, artists and people seeking something new. The club was a big success. The club, located in la Pla√ßa Reial, became the heart of jazz music in Barcelona. Finally after a few months and several disagreements, mostly with Jack Hand, Besser decided to move on. Their pianist, at that time, Jos√© Fuste, was offered a job as the leader of the band at \\"Florida Park\\", a night club in Madrid. He took Besser with him. Besser stayed a couple of weeks but decided it was not for him. He quit and went to work at the \\"Whiskey Jazz Club\\" in Madrid. Around Europe While working and jamming in Madrid, he met the members of the \\"Manny Kelley Orchestra\\", with Manny at the piano, the German bass player Pitt Rudolph, the German drummer Peer Wyboris, the Spanish sax and guitar player Pedro Iturralde, Audrey Gray on vocals and conga and Besser playing trumpet, valve trombone and vibes. These musicians were all basically jazz players, but played commercial music to make money. They worked and recorded around Spain until one day they were offered a job in Athens, Greece. In Athens, they played at the Casino de Athens and were offered a job in Ankara, Turkey. Besser was notified that his father was seriously ill and returned to Minneapolis. When he arrived his father was still holding on, so Besser had to find work to pay bills. He took a gig with an entertaining lounge group that was working the Midwest and shortly thereafter his father died. Besser quit the lounge group and returned to Athens, Greece, and joined the \\"Lavranos Orchestra\\" where he stayed for approximately two and a half years playing in the best hotels and doing some recording. He still came back to \\"Jamboree Jazz Club\\" in Barcelona for about two weeks where he played with his own band and Audrey Gray on vocals. He then went to Madrid to look for work, then to Seville, Kenitra, Morocco, and finally returned to Athens to re-join the \\"Lavranos Band\\". From May 1966, to October 1967, they worked around Europe. Big business in New York City In October 27, 1967, Besser returned to New York City with the intention of joining a \\"Name Band\\" or else going to Las Vegas to seek work. Within two days he was offered a job traveling with \\"The Glenn Miller Orchestra under the direction of Buddy DeFranco. Besser stayed with the band until June 28, 1970, when he left to go with the \\"Billy Maxted Jazz Band\\". He stayed with Maxted until the winter of 1971, when he decided to try to make it in New York City. At first he worked with some Latin bands, did a few gigs in the Catskills and a few nightclubs. In September 1971 he was offered a job in a new Greek/Israeli club \\"Sirocco\\". He stayed for a year and then went to a new club \\"Alexander the Great\\" which only lasted a short while. On September 7, 1973, he married Shelley Drayer, who was working in the stock market, then moving on to Swiss Air and then started her own financing business. They lived on West 91st Street in Manhattan until 1974, when they bought a house in Long Beach Long Island. Besser was then doing private parties plus contracting the musicians and playing with the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus in Madison Square Garden, Nassau Coliseum, West Palm Beach, Miami and New Jersey. He was then accepted an offer to lead a wedding band for the Steven Scott Orchestras, where he stayed for approximately seven years moving on to Alex Donner society band as a leader, contractor, salesman and co-producer as well as conductor of Alex's two CDs. Five gigs a week In June 2007 Besser and his wife sold their New York home and moved to Jupiter Florida. After breaking his left wrist, fractured his right hip and got through a left vocal cord cancer, he is now living Florida and playing five nights a week in many different bands.

The genus contains a single described species, Phasmagyps patritus which is possibly the oldest New World vulture known, though its placement in the family Cathartidae has been questioned. History and classification Phasmagyps is known from a single fragmentary fossil bone, the holotype housed in the paleontology collections of the Colorado Museum of Natural History in Boulder, Colorado and given the number 1078. In 1923 Philip Reinheinter collected the specimen from the Weld County Trigonias quarry, possibly a fossilized watering hole. The quarry worked sedimentary rocks that are positioned approximately above the contact between the Pierre Shale and the Chadron Formation, thus dating the fossils to the Lower Chadronian. The fossil was first studied by the American paleontologist and ornithologist Alexander Wetmore; his 1927 type description of the new genus and species was published in the journal Proceedings of the Colorado Museum of Natural History. In the description, Wetmore did not give any etymological explanations for the genus and species names, though phasma is Latin and Greek for a phantom or apparition and Gyps identifies the genus as a vulture. The fossil was reexamined in the early 1980s by avian paleontologist Storrs L. Olson. In a 1985 paper he gives a brief comment on the genus. He stated without going into specific details, that while the fossil is superficially similar to those of Cathartidae members, however it possesses notable features which are different and as such he regarded the position of the genus as problematic. In their 2005 description of a Peruvian fossil, Marcelo Stucchi and Steven Emslie noted the disputed nature of Phasmagyps, but maintained the placement in Cathartidae and noted the genus as the oldest member of the family in the Americas. Description When first described by Wetmore, Phasmagyps was described as being one third larger than the modern Black vulture, Coragyps atratus. This is contradicted by James Ducey's 1992 paper which lists Phasmagyps as being \\"not much larger than the Black Vulture\\". The single known fossil is a partial upper leg bone, specifically the lower section of the right tibiotarsus. As preserved, the largest diameter of the bone is around the outer condyle, and the width across the condyles is . The diameter at the smallest area of the preserved bone shaft is .

The trip was done in association with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California and took place off the east coast of Mexico and in the West Indies. Story Errol Flynn leaves his house on Mullholland Drive by helicopter captained by Paul Mantz and goes to the Scripps Institution. He goes on board the Zaca and visits San Benito Island off the west coast of Baja California, home to a number of rare endemic plant and animal species, the Panama Canal and Jamaica. Production The trip started in August 1946. On board were Flynn, his father, his wife Nora, and John Decker, Howard Hill, Professor Carl Hubbs, Charles Gross and Jerry Corneya. After a month of sailing, many of the group left, including Flynn's wife and father, but Flynn pushed on through the Panama Canal to the Caribbean to Cap Haitien. Before going through the Canal Flynn stayed in Acapulco, where the Zaca had been hired to appear in location shooting during 1946 for The Lady from Shanghai (1948). Release Due to Flynn's 1948 divorce from Nora, release of the film was held up until December 1952. Although shot on 16mm the film was blown up to 35mm. In October 1951 it was announced Flynn had produced two films based on his travels, Voyage of the Zaca and Whaling in the Pacific. Critical reception The critic from the Los Angeles Times said \\"it is rather a family affair with Flynn narrating effectively enough.\\" Filmink called it \\"not a bad little movie ‚Äì mostly a travelogue to be sure, but a travelogue starring Errol Flynn, and it‚Äôs a fascinating insight to the sailing aspect of his life.\\" Deep Sea Fishing Deep Sea Fishing was another film based on a fishing trip Flynn took with Howard Hill. It was shot in 16mm during the Cruise of the Zaca journey and involves Flynn and Hill boarding a small launch to fish for marlin and sail fish. Because of Flynn's contract with Warner Bros, which prevented his appearances of this kind, his name is never mentioned by the narrator.

History The initial facility consisting of a single 72mw GE Frame 7EA simple cycle gas turbine was completed in 1995. The station was originally planned to be operated mostly during hotter periods when demand would be the highest. A second similar unit was added in 2006 In 2011, a 484mw combined cycle facility was completed consisting of two GE Frame 7FA+E gas turbines with the exhaust heat from both units captured to produce steam for a GE D11 steam turbine to generate additional electricity  Facility Due to its location in a desert where water is limited, the combined cycle plant utilizes a six-story-high dry cooling system. Operating similar to a massive automotive radiator, thirty-six diameter fans are used to help cool and condense steam back in to water. The dry cooling system allows the combined cycle facility to operate with just 7% of the water normally used by conventional water cooled plants of similar rating.

The 2002 Sin Piedad was the third event under that name that CMLL promoted as their last major show of the year, always held in December. The main event was a traditional two-out-of-three falls Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match between Rey Bucanero and Vampiro Canadiense where both wrestlers risked their hair on the outcome of the match. The show also featured Shocker defending the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship against √öltimo Guerrero and four additional matches. Production Background The Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker Sin Piedad (\\"No Pity\\" or \\"No Mercy\\"). CMLL has intermittently held a show billed specifically as Sin Piedad since 2000, primarily using the name for their \\"end of the year\\" show in December, although once they held a Sin Piedad show in August as well. CMLL has on occasion used a different name for the end-of-year show but Sin Piedad is the most commonly used name. All Sin Piedad shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Sin Piedad shows replaced their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2002 Sin Piedad show was the third show to use the name. Storylines The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The main event and the semi-main event both stemmed from the same storyline, pitting the team of Los Guerreros del Infierno (√öltimo Guerrero and Rey Bucanero) against the tecnico team of Shocker and Vampiro Canadiense. The storyline started not long after Guerrero and Bucanero defeated Negro Casas and El Hijo del Santo to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship in mid-2002 and originally centered around Los Guerreros championship, with Shocker and Vampiro chasing the title. The two teams met in one of the feature matches at the CMLL 69th Anniversary Show where Los Guerreros successfully defended the tag team title. Following the title defense the storyline split into two, with √öltimo Guerrero focusing on Shocker, demanding a match for Shocker's CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship. In the other storyline the feud between Bucanero and Vampiro focused more on a Lucha de Apuestas or bet match challenge. Since neither held a singles championship they would both bet their hair against the outcome of the match and be shaved bald in case they lost. The Luchas de Apuestas match is the most prestigious match type in Lucha Libre, which is why it was chosen over the championship match to main event the show. In the semi-main event √öltimo Guerrero won the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship after forcing Shocker to submit to his own trademark submission hold La Reienera (a Modified spinning backbreaker rack). In the main event Vampiro gained a measure of revenge for his tag team partner as he defeated Rey Bucanero, pinning him to win the third and deciding fall. Following the match Bucanero's long hair was cut off and then the rest of his hair was shaved off as per the Lucha Libre traditions. Aftermath Sin Piedad marked the end of the storyline between Los Guerreros del Infierno and Shocker and Vampiro. Shocker moved on to create Los Guapos (The Hansome Ones) with M√°scara M√°gica and was actually on the opposite side of Vampiro in a match on CMLL's next major show, the 2003 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\\"Homage to two legends\\") show. Los Guerreros held the CMLL World Tag Team Championship until the end of 2003 where they were defeated by Shocker and his new partner L.A. Park √öltimo Guerrero's reign as CMLL World Light Heavyweight Champion lasted 1,309 days, making him the longest reigning champion in the history of the title. He lost the title to Rey Bucanero on July 14, 2006. Second match worker Gen√©tico would later be given a new wrestling mask and ring name, reborn as El Sagrado (\\"The Sacred One\\") in CMLL. Dr. X, Hooligan and Ramstein would all be part of the group Pandilla Guerrera (\\"Gang of Warriors\\") that was formed in 2005.

Polyglyphanodontians were the dominant group of lizards in North America and Asia during the Late Cretaceous. Most polyglyphanodontians are Late Cretaceous in age, though the oldest one, Kuwajimalla kagaensis, is known from the Early Cretaceous (Valanginian to Hauterivian) Kuwajima Formation (Japan). Early Cretaceous South American taxon Tijubina, and possibly also Olindalacerta, might also fall within Polyglyphanodontia or be closely allied to the group, but if so, they would be two of only three Gondwanan examples of an otherwise Laurasian clade (the third one, and the only unambiguous one, being Bicuspidon hogreli from the Kem Kem Beds of Morocco). They produced a remarkable range of forms. Chamopsiids, including Chamops, were characterized by large, blunt, crushing teeth, and were most likely omnivores. Macrocephalosaurus, from the Gobi Desert, was a specialized herbivore; it grew to roughly a meter long and had multicusped, leaf-shaped teeth like those of modern iguanas. Polyglyphanodon, from the Maastrichtian of Utah, was another herbivore, but its teeth formed a series of transverse blades, similar to those of Trilophosaurus. Peneteius had remarkable, multicusped teeth, similar to those of mammals. The polyglyphanodontids first appear in the latter part of the Early Cretaceous in North America, and became extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. Polyglyphanodontians closely resembled the teiid lizards, and purported teiid lizards from the Late Cretaceous appear to be polyglyphanodontians. Classification Tianyusaurus fossil A large-scale phylogenetic analysis of squamates conducted by Conrad (2008) found polyglyphanodontians (called Polyglyphanodontidae by Conrad) to be closely related to teiid lizards. In the strict consensus tree recovered in the analysis, polyglyphanodontids were part of a polytomy (unresolved evolutionary relationship) with teiids, gymnophthalmids, Chamops and lacertids; in the Adams consensus tree polyglyphanodontids were the sister group to teiids. (Some other studies that recognize a close relationship between polyglyphanodontians and teiids use the name Borioteiioidea rather than Polyglyphanodontia, although Borioteiioidea encompasses only North American polyglyphanodontians.) Conrad's analysis also recovered Sineoamphisbaena, a Cretaceous lizard that resembles legless amphisbaenian lizards, as a member of Polyglyphanodontidae. On the other hand, a later large-scale phylogenetic analysis of fossil and living squamates published in 2012 by Gauthier et al. found that Polyglyphanodontia was not particularly closely related to teiids, but rather that it was the sister taxon of the clade containing the extinct marine mosasaurs, their closest relatives and the major lizard group Scleroglossa. Because the first scleroglossans appear in the Late Jurassic, polyglyphanodontians must also have originated in the Late Jurassic if this phylogeny is correct. However, polyglyphanodontians are limited to the Cretaceous, meaning that a long ghost lineage may exist. The primary analysis of Gauthier et al. (2012) did not find polyglyphanodontians and Sineoamphisbaena to be closely related; however, the authors noted that when all snake-like squamates and mosasaurs were removed from the analysis, and burrowing squamates were then added individually to it, Sineoamphisbaena grouped with polyglyphanodontians. Gauthier et al. (2012) considered it possible that Sineoamphisbaena was a burrowing polyglyphanodontian, though, agreeing with. Subsequent analyses based on have also supported Sineoamphisbaenia as a polyglyphanodontian (the combined molecular and morphological analysis of M√ºller et al.; in the morphology only analyses carried out by Wiens et al. but not their combined molecular and morphological analyses; and in morphology only analyses carried out by who were describing new polyglyphanodontians from Asia [Funuisaurus and Tianyusaurus]). A phylogenetic analysis conducted by Reeder et al. (2015) based on combined molecular and morphological data (based on ) recovered Polyglyphanodontia as members of Toxicofera; specifically, it was recovered as the sister group of Iguania. Lee (2009) analyzed a combined molecular and morphological data set (based on earlier studies by Lee) and also had found polyglyphanodontians as the sister to iguanians but Lee's finding was not acknowledged by.

It was created in 1972 by the evangelical preacher Luis Eduardo Moreno, his mother Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Moreno and his wife Mar√≠a Luisa Piraquive. The Church has over 1200 locations in more than fifty countries and territories, and visits 40 other nations worldwide.Numbers based on the church's locations web page The main broadcasts of the church (sermons) on its YouTube channel have more than 300.000 views only in spanish, and it is simultaneously interpreted in 12 languages. The leader of the Church is the Colombian Christian female leader Mar√≠a Luisa Piraquive, while the current General Preacher is Carlos Alberto Baena.  History   Background  Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International, Logo. The origins of the Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International go back to the wandering of Luis Eduardo Moreno and his mother Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Moreno through various Christian denominations, where he served as preacher. After his marriage in 1966, his wife Mar√≠a Luisa Piraquive joined them. Luis Eduardo had disagreements with the leaders of the various evangelical denominations in which he worked, due to the fact that he was pressed to give results in terms of growth of the churches at his charge.  Beginning  Luis Eduardo Moreno during a baptism Disappointed by the permanent disagreements with the leaders of the denominations in which they congregated, the Moreno Piraquive family decided not to attend any church anymore and instead, they decided to pray at their house. In 1972, during the prayers of a small group of four people congregated at the Moreno Piraquive family house, they experienced the first prophecy from God in the Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ. In such prophecy, God gave them the instructions about how to direct the church. As time passed by the church expanded to other departments of Colombia. Currently it has locations in more than 300 Colombian municipalities. In 1997, the word International was added to the Church's name, and in 2000 the leaders of the church created a political party in Colombia, called MIRA, whose current President is Carlos Alberto Baena.

This practice reminds of the early Christian Church's gift of prophecy, mentioned by Paul in the Epistle to the Corinthians,I Corinthians chapter 14. by John in his GospelJohn, chapter 16, verses 7 to 15. and other New Testament books. Unlike other Pentecostal denominations, prophecies are seldom general (i. e., given to the public attending the service), but individual, and refer to the past, present and future of the person receiving the message. Its form is of specific promises (of healing, happiness, economic prosperity, spiritual experiencies, marriage, and so on) expected to be fulfilled by God through His power, as well as commandments on the individual's life, as a \\"guidance for life\\". Those to whom the promises have been fulfilled often give testimony of them in public in the religious services.Testimonies The gift of prophecy is not the only spiritual gift said to appear in the Church. Of a central importance is the gift of tongues, which is the sign of being baptised by the Holy Spirit, resembling the New Testament's Pentecost day. There are also gifts of healing, spiritual visions, dream interpretation, casting away demons and discernment, among others. Believers are encouraged to ask for these gifts in prayer, so that all the congregation may have a personal experience with God. In a typical prayer room there could be one prophesier for each thirty believers. Facade of the prayer room at Las Ferias in Bogota Teaching imparted in the prayer room at Las Ferias Cundinamarca.  Maria Luisa de Moreno International Foundation  In addition to its religious activities, the church offers social assistance (e.g. via educational programs and health services) in the countries in which it has presence, mainly in Colombia. One of the means through which the church performs this activities is the Maria Luisa de Moreno International Foundation, a philanthropic institution founded in 2000 under the mottos \\"Help at all levels\\", \\"Architects of hearts\\" and currently \\"Helping is our work\\". This NGO is responsible for the distribution of food and the activities related to educational and social services.

From 1950 to 1970, he taught agriculture at Modesto Junior College. His increasing involvement in activist causes prompted him to move to UC Davis in 1970, where he helped to develop its Native American studies program. He remained there until his retirement in 1993, when the program became a full-fledged department and is currently one of only three such departments offering doctoral degrees. He was a co-founder of California Indian Legal Services and the Native American Rights Fund and was involved in securing passage of the federal Indian Education and Indian Tribal Community College acts. Thirty-one Indian community colleges and dozens of K-12 reservation school programs resulted from this legislation.Obituary in the L.A. Times, 3/16/2005 He was also a major consultant in the creation of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian and was a three-time appointee to the National Advisory Council on Indian Education  D-Q University  The achievement he was reportedly most proud of was his role in creating D-Q University, one of the first six tribal colleges and the only one in California. Jack D. Forbes (a co-founder of the University) has said, \\"It was a dream that the late Carl Gorman and I had worked on from 1961-1962, but it was Dave's organizing skill and patience that came to the fore in 1971 when DQU finally acquired flesh and bones.\\" For many years, Risling served as President of DQU's board of trustees. Only two months before his death, he participated in the decision to close the University, which had lost its accreditation. For about three years in the early 1990s, Risling, Jack D. Forbes, Morrison & Foerster and many others collaborated with filmmaker Jan Crull, Jr. to make a film about the controversy surrounding D-Q University and its turbulent relationship with the U.S. government. The media had labelled this school as being \\"controversial\\"e.g., William L. MacDougal and Warner Ragsdale,Jr. \\"Round 2 in Indian Wars Rages in Courts\\" U.S. News & World Report,Oct. 25, 1982, pp. 63-64 for years and as one of the American Indian Movement'sJoseph A.

S. House of Representatives Hearing: D-Q University Land Transfer, July 29, 1981, pp.: 48; Washington,D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1983. Crull encountered friction from some of his overall committee staff colleagues, people working for the Bill's sponsors, and the Administration in his work on this legislation and the shaping of the hearing He and the Rislings had developed a rapport over the years since which ultimately led to the A Free People, Free To Choose film project.Crull is an anomaly in many ways, for examples: educationally (fifteen international institutions of higher learning according to the British D.I.B.); occupationally (occasionally taking nondescript professional positions while simultaneously doing work for or with some of the world's most powerful institutions or actors--or ones even like the eponymous Edward von Kloberg III --often becoming a footnote to events evoking a number of major international headlines; genealogically (springing from a pool, creating bloodlines to distant luminaries such as Queen Elizabeth II through her mother or Audrey Hepburn and countless others or lines by a series of marriages to say, for instance, Karl Marx; societally (having worked for the poor in many and varied places) Well over a hundred hours of footage had been shot when a schism between some of the film's subjects erupted into becoming litigation. Morrison & Foersteran internationally San Francisco based law firm which had represented D-Q University pro bono in its decades long legal struggles was the first sponsor to withdraw from the project and eventually Crull had to scrap it even though distribution for a completed film was already in place.

The Mark Yagalla episode  Subsequent to her relationship with Hefner, Sandy became involved with financier Mark Yagalla, who lavished her with expensive gifts, including jewels. After Yagalla was arrested for conducting a Ponzi scam, a USA federal receiver was appointed to recover assets which Yagalla had embezzled from the clients of his $40 million Asbury Capital Fund. Sandy was ordered to return the gifts he had given her, including nearly one million dollars in jewelry. Sandy and her new boyfriend, nightclub doorman Michael Tardio, collaborated to sell some of the jewelry. Tardio made arrangements to meet a potential buyer on the evening of September 2, 2002; however, Tardio and his accomplice Christopher Monson were found later that night, riddled with bullets in a burning Mercedes SUV, parked in Studio City, California. The jewelry was never recovered. In 2003, Yagalla pleaded guilty to securities fraud, and was sentenced to five years and five months at Pensacola Federal Prison. The government recovered $1.3 million from an auction of his assets. In February 2011, the crime was featured in the CBS documentary series 48 Hours Mystery and a $75,000 reward was offered by the City Council of Studio City, California, to help solve the crime. Many of those involved in the events were patrons of Garden of Eden nightclub, where Tardio was a doorman.

The entrance to Booming Ice Chasm was initially found by accident by members of the Alberta Speleological Society while attempting to reach a different cave in June, 2008. It was subsequently explored and mapped by the Alberta Speleological Society. Speleologist Chas Yonge considered that it is the largest ice cave in North America. The main shaft, although an inclined passage that is not completely vertical, is considered Canada's second deepest shaft due to the technical requirements of descent. It is a cold-trap cave whereby cold air enters through a bottleneck and is never able to escape, generating conditions for perennial ice. The result of this is that the entrance pitch and floor are covered in a dense, cascading glacier-like ice block and there is an underground, frozen waterfall and lake.Carolyn Jarvis, \\"Mapping the Underworld,\\" Global Television, Shaw Media Inc., September 28, 2013. It is speculated that Booming Ice Chasm may also hold potential as a source of new super antibiotics. This is because it is thought that a specialised species of microorganisms that have adapted to the closed and nutrient limited conditions of the cave.  Location  Booming Ice Chasm is located on the Southern end of the Continental Divide of the Canadian Rockies, in Alberta. It is approximately 150 kilometre south- southwest of Calgary, Alberta and is situated near the summit of Mount Sentry at an elevation of 2200 metres on the south-side ridge. The cave's coordinates are approximately 49¬∞37‚ÄôN, 114¬∞38‚ÄôW. Booming Ice Chasm is located in the Crowsnest Pass area. It is one of three widely known caving systems in the Crowsnest Pass, along with Gargantua and Cleft Cave. Booming Ice Chasm is also approximately several hundred metres east of another ice cave called Ice Chest.  Discovery and Exploration  Booming Ice Chasm was initially identified in 2005, when speleologist Charles (Chas) Yonge came across a black speck on Google Earth.Three years later, it was explored and charted by the Alberta Speleological Society, led by Yonge. While attempting to reach another cave nearby, the entrance was found by Yonge and members of the Alberta Speleological Society in June, 2008. Over the course of 2008, Yonge and other members of the Alberta Speleological Society explored and surveyed the majority of the cave, to a length of 704 meters and depth of 140 meters. Some prominent leads remained after these initial explorations. Additional exploration in the summer of 2012 continued exploration of unexplored sections of the cave. It was during this exploration that the lowest point in the cave was reached at 179 meters below the entrance. In 2013, Global News‚Äô 16x9 accompanied caver Nicholaus Vieira and a team into the cave, where one of the waterfall ice climbing leads was completed. In 2015, doing a bolt climbing lead, Kathleen Graham explored further parts of the bottom of the main shaft. There are passages in the cave, especially on the North and South side, that remain uncharted.  Cave Setting and Geological Features  The surveyed length and depth of Booming Ice Chasm is 961 metres and 179 metres respectively and is ranked the 61st longest and 30th deepest cave in Canada. On the upper descending part of the cave, near the entrance, is a dense, steeply downward sloping sheet of ice, dropping approximately 140 metres. This is referred to as an ice fall or cascading glacier-like ice block and is controlled by cave morphology and the local climate. Specifically, it is formed by firn and seepage water. Unlike Silica Ice Cave in Slovakia where the ice mass shifts downward on the inclined rock base, in Booming Ice Chasm the ice mass is generally stable within a short range. A similar downward sloping ice block like this is also found in Arnold Ice Cave in the United States of America. The thickness of this ice fall facilitates accessibility to Booming Ice Chasm. Approximately 140 metres below the entrance, on the cave floor, lies a large chamber that features an underground lake, which is completely frozen over. The depth of the lake is unknown as it is built up of numerous sheets of ice and water. The temperature of the water is just over freezing at 0.4 degrees Celsius. There is also a large frozen waterfall, located 100 metres from the entrance of the cave. It is a 22 meter ascent, that opens up to unexplored chambers and tight passages, which may lead back to the entrance of the cave. The mouth of the cave is a few metres wide, which funnels into a pit cave. The entrance walls are lined with hoar frost, snow and loose scree. The two main types of sedimentary rocks that form the cave are limestone and shale. Other geological features include stalagmites, stalactites, ice crystals, rocks and boulders.  Climate and Formation  There are two conditions for Booming Ice Chasm to be characterised as an ice cave and in turn what maintains and creates the perennial ice wall, frozen waterfall and frozen lake all found in the cave. Firstly, it must be a cold-trap cave. This is a phenomenon that only occurs when a body of very cold air essentially becomes trapped by a bottleneck within the cave, neither being able to move freely nor being able to escape. The principal reason for this is that heavier, colder air entering through the top of the cave, sinks downwards through the bottleneck to the lower reaches of the cave. As it does, it displaces warmer, more buoyant air which naturally rises and exits the mouth of Booming Ice Chasm. As the warmer air escapes into the atmosphere, it is replaced by a new current of cold air that enters the cave in small circular flows creating an air flow system similar to swirling eddies in a stream, known as eddy currents. As a result, Booming Ice Chasm is insulated from external warm air, maintaining temperatures within Booming Ice Chasm to less than freezing all year around. Secondly, the ice itself is slowly expanded by the cumulative action of low levels of precipitation, seepage and drip water throughout the year. The ice floor is incrementally added to, as small amounts of water from occasional seasonal rain falls or melted snow, drips or seeps into the cave. These small amounts of moisture fall downwards and freeze over existing ice surfaces to form a new thin, ice layer on the walls and frozen lake floor. This is repeated throughout the year according to seasonality of water sources. A map by caver, Nicholaus Vieira shows downward sloping paleo currents that indicates these types of incremental water flows. Accumulated snow fall at the summit of Mount Sentry, at the entrance of the Booming Ice Chasm, may facilitate this further.  Biological Value  It is speculated by microbiologist and Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Thompson Rivers University, Naowarat (Ann) Cheeptham, that Booming Ice Chasm may hold potential as a source of new super antibiotics. This is a question which biologists and speleologists are seeking to address. In particular, it is believed that there are potentially specialised species of micro-organisms that have adapted to and thrived in the closed environment of Booming Ice Chasm. These species are considered to be dominant and may hold significant pharmacological potential as a potent weapon against antibiotic-resistant infections. There are two climate and formation characteristics of Booming Ice Chasm, which have created a closed environment and in turn may may have led to this potential existence of these specialised species of micro-organisms. The first of these is the microclimate, that is, the localised set of climatic conditions that exist in the cave itself as distinct from its surroundings. The closed nature of Booming Ice Chasm‚Äôs physical and atmospheric systems means that the microclimate is stable or controlled, not in a constant state of change, throughout the year. The second factor is the lack of plants, which in most environments form the basis of food chains and microbial activity, thereby implying limited nutrients in Booming Ice Chasm. The combination of limited nutrients and the quantities of essential elements such as carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen in ice caves, has implications for the type of micro- organisms or microbes that may exist in these closed environments. Cheeptham pursued this opportunity by having NIcholaus Vieira plant petri dishes in Booming Ice Chasm for one month and collecting bacteria specimens for research. The bacteria is then screened against superbugs. The research has continued with sediments collected more recently by Christian Stenner and Adam Walker to assist in Cheeptham's research. During an expedition in 2019, Sediments from the cave were collected by Katie Graham and Christian Stenner and sent to NASA Johnson Space Centre and the University of Alberta. The purpose of the research involves determining the mechanisms for colonization and survival by microbial communities in dark, nutrient poor (oligotrophic) environments, and for Metagenomic studies and collecting genomes of bacteria to add to the database.  Hazards and Tourism  The cave itself also presents a number of hazards in terms of initial access and subsequent utility. Booming Ice Chasm is located in a relatively remote part of the province of Alberta in Canada. The closest town is Coleman, a very small township located approximately 522 kilometres from Alberta‚Äôs capital, Edmonton and can only be reached by road. Access to Booming Ice Chasm from Coleman is along a 10 kilometre stretch of highway to Mount Sentry. Beyond the general location, there is no specifically marked trail nor an established access route leading to the cave's exact location. Access to the cave itself is not through a ground level entry way as the entrance must be accessed by specialty equipped climbers via a 700 vertical metre ascent up Mount Sentry, an ascent made more hazardous by a covering of loose scree across Mount Sentry‚Äôs face. The entrance to the cave is concealed behind a rocky ledge and regarded as nearly impossible to find. Despite an area marked out on the high ride south of the summit for helicopter landings, there is a complete lack of supportive infrastructure. The mouth of the cave gives way to a steep 140 metre downward slope of thick ice. Given the steepness of the slope, the smoothness of the ice and the lack of restraining objects on the descent, dropping an object or falling on the ice can also pose a risk for climbers. Consistent with this, animals are often found dead at the bottom of the cave. The only accessible map of Booming Ice Chasm, created by caver Nicholaus Vieira in 2013, has a UIS grade of 4. According to the Survey and Mapping Working Group, UIS Informatics Commission, 2012, this correlates to a mapping description that although providing significant detail in measurements, still retain an error ratio of 5%, such that it may be sufficiently inaccurate so as to pose physical hazards. The climate of Mount Sentry also presents several hazards for greater scale exploration and potential for development of commercial activities, with high pressure systems, sub-zero temperatures and strong winds. Another hazard is the hollow structure of Booming Ice Chasm, which amplifies all sounds made inside the cave. This can cause communicating inside Booming Ice Chasm to be very difficult. Exploration and tourism in Booming Ice Chasm is undeveloped and expert opinion from photographer Francois-Xavier De Ruydts, who has joined multiple expeditions in Booming Ice Chasm suggests that tourism should be actively discouraged given the fragility and unique nature of this geological formation.  Media  Coverage in popular media has exposed the cave to audiences around the world. Online and print journalism has included Macleans and Global 16x9. Film director Francois-Xavier De Ruydts‚Äô documentary, Terres d‚ÄôExploration explores remote locations of Canada, with each episode focusing on a different type of landscape. The first episode of season two, 'Grottes: Le Monde sous nos pieds', investigates Booming Ice Chasm, as well as neighbouring cave, White Rabbit. The actual filming for the episode on Booming Ice Chasm took three days. Christian Stenner and Adam Walker were filmed collecting sediment samples to support research into antibiotic resistance. In order to secure the camera on the angled ice fall, De Ruydts uses fastened tennis balls to the leg of each tripod, such that the felt sticks to the ice. LED lights were used to illuminate the cave for the video shoot. The episode was released on May 7, 2018. It runs for 52 minutes and is rated G - General on the Canadian Home Video Rating System.  Etymology  The name Booming Ice Chasm refers to both its characterisation as an ice cave and the quality of sound created by its physical structures. The ‚Äòbooming‚Äô is derived from the acoustics of the cave. The relative hollowness of Booming Ice Chasm creates a closed system chamber which not only amplifies all sounds but creates a ringing echo affect. This renders conversing in normal tones inside the cave very difficult. As a result, communication and radio usage is limited to a whisper and necessary syllables only.

She is also known as Sati, Bhavani, Parvati or Hemavati. Mother Shailaputri is the absolute form of Mother Nature or Gramma devata. Iconography Goddess Shailaputri is depicted with two hands and has a crescent moon on her forehead. She holds a trident in her right hand and a lotus flower in the left. She rides on mount Nandi (bull). History Shailaputri is the Adi parasakti, who was born in the house of King of Mountains ‚ÄúParvat Raj Himalaya‚Äù. The name ‚ÄúShailaputri‚Äù literally means the daughter (putri) of mountain (shaila). Variously known as Sati Bhavani, Parvati or Hemavati, the daughter of Himavat - the king of the Himalayas. The embodiment of the power of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, she rides a bull and carries a trident and a lotus in her two hands. In previous birth, she was daughter of Daksha, Sati. Once Daksha had organized a big Yagna and did not invite Shiva. But Sati being obstinate, reached there. Thereupon Daksha insulted Shiva. Sati could not tolerate the insult of husband and burnt herself in the fire of Yagna. In other birth, she became the daughter of Himalaya in the name of Parvati - Hemavati and married Shiva. As per Upanishad, she had torn and the egotism of Indra, etc. Devtas. Being ashamed they bowed and prayed that, \\"In fact, thou are Shakti, we all - Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are capable by getting Shakti from you.\\" In some scriptures like Shiva Purana and Devi-Bhagavata Purana the story of Mother Goddess is written as follows: Maa Bhagwati in her earlier birth was born as a daughter of Daksha Prajapati. Then her name was Sati and she was married to Lord Shiva. But in a sacrificial ceremony organized by her father Prajapati Daksha, her body was burned in the yogic fire, because she could not bear the insult of her husband Lord Shiva by her father Prajapati Daksha in the sacrificial ceremony. In her next birth she became Goddess Parvati, the daughter of Parvat Raj Himalaya. Other avatar of navadurga is the incarnation of mother Parvati,she also incernated her as 32 vidyas , who was again known as Hemavati. In her Hemavati aspect, she defeated all prominent gods. Like her previous birth, in this life also Maa Shailaputri (Parvati) married Lord Shiva. Getting her name as Mata Shailputri has a story behind it. This was the time when Devi Parvati was still in her teens. Once She was playing with her friends in the grasslands near the Himalayan mountains, which was her home. Grasslands were for grazing cattles and near to flowed a big river, namely Varuna River with lotus flower on its edge. Mata Parvati was playing a game like hide seek in the woods nearby. It was her turn to seek her friends in the wood. While she was seeking her friends she came across the shore of the river full of lotus flowers. It was so mesmerizing for her, she wanted a flower from the river. She was about to pick one from it, when suddenly a cow came mooing to her from the grasslands as if she was in great pain and wanted a help from Devi Parvati. The cow took Devi Parvati to the nearby grasslands . What Devi Parvati saw was horrible at first sight. She saw the skeletons of many cows as if the flesh was freshly eaten by someone. The picture in front of Devi Parvati was almost impossible to understand so she kept her hand on the cows head and closed her eyes. Then she got to know about the demoness Tarika (Sister of terrific demon Tarkasur). Tarika was sent to the earth by Tarkasur itself to kill the new form of Devi Adishakti, Devi Parvati. Devi Parvati was threat to Tarkasur as her and Lord Mahadev's son was threat for his life. After Tarika, being sent to Earth to kill Devi Paravti, she saw these cows grazing on the open grasslands and cowherd with them. She found this as delicious treat. So, she secretly she started attacking one cow at a time. After a while, when cowherd got a look on the cows the number was depreciating. So, he decided to find the cause and asked the person who was taking the cows. Suddenly Tarika occurs in the terrific form, with red blood all over her face. So he came to know that this non other than a demoness who is killing all of his cows. So he decided to attack, the cowherd approached Tarika, but she killed the cowherd and started eating rest of the cows and cowherd. One of the cows away for help and came across the shore of River Varuna and found Devi Parvati. After getting to know about the all over situation Devi Parvati decided to fight against the demoness Tarika. For the fight she took an unusual track. She took a form Shail ( a small mountain like stone of nearby 10-15 feet) as like her father Lord Himavan. The cow hid behind the structure and started mooing. The cow's mooing attracted the evil demoness Tarika towards her. Tarika arrived there and saw the Shail and the cow behind it. Tarika tried to fetch the cow but it wasn't possible as the Shail would move from one side to another. Tarika was trying hard to fetch the cow but was unable to. On the other hand it was almost evening and about to get dark, where Lord Himavan and Parvati's both friends arrived at the Grassland. They saw the conflict going on over there between the cow, Shail and demon Tarika but Parvati was nowhere to be seen. Suddenly some villagers also arrived at the location in search of the cowherd and they too saw this conflict. Himavan being the ruler of the region was drastically shocked by watching the demoness in his territory and wanted to wipe her out. Tarika, fed up by the conflict with the Shaila, decided to break the Shaila. On the other hand Himavan raised sword to kill Tarika and Tarika raised the sword on the Shaila. Suddenly the Shaila burst and everyone stayed still. As the Shail started bursting, slowly golden rays emerged out of the Shail and Devi Paravati came out in her true form with a golden crown on her head and Trishul in the hand. Everyone who saw this scene were mesmerized. The cow was still in her position behind Devi Paravati. Himavan took a step back but Tarika was furious. Again she was about to attack Devi Parvati. Devi Parvati lifted the Trishul and threw on Tarika. Tarika was hence defeated and killed. Himavan, Parvati's both friends and the villagers started praising Devi Parvati. Meanwhile the cow ran towards the shore of the river, picked one lotus, brought it and gave it to Devi Parvati. After this incidence Himavan named Devi Parvati as Mata Shailputri (a small mountain, daughter of the King of all mountains, who has taken rebirth from Shail, the part of mountain as his Daughter) and this form of Devi Parvati with golden crown on her head, Trishul in one hand, Lotus in another and a cow standing behind her came to be known as Mata Shailputri and as this form Devi Parvati is the first she took after coming into life, It is been worshipped on the first day of the Navratri. After this incident, Devi Shailputri gave boon to the cow who stood behind her during conflict and intended to protect the Nature. Devi Shailputri's boon was, like Devi Adishkati, from that day onwards the cow will also be a universal mother of all the creatures, without Gaupujan none of the auspicious works will get its fulfillment and killing a cow will be next to Brahmahatya (the eternal and ultimate massacre}. The village where all this happened is now said to be located in Jalalipura in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. There is a Mata Shailputri Temple also in the village. She is Devi of the root chakra, who, upon awakening, begins her journey upwards. Sitting on a cow and making her first journey from the Muladhara chakra. As from her father to her husband ‚Äì the awakening Shakti, beginning her search for Lord Shiva or making a move towards her Shiva. So that, in Navratri pooja the first day Yogis keep their minds concentrated on Muladhara. This is the starting point of their spiritual discipline. They started their Yogasadha from here. Shailaputri is the Muladhara Shakti to be realized within Self and sought for higher depths, in the yogic meditation. It is the rock of spiritual standing and the whole world gets strength from the Shailaputri aspect of Purna Prakriti Durga. Before Mother Goddess was born as the daughter of King Himavan, in her previous birth, she was the daughter of King Daksha. In this form, her name was Sati, who was very much devoted to Shiva and in love with him. King Daksha was against Lord Shiva, and knew that his daughter fell in love with an ascetic and expressed his disapproval. Sati made every effort to make her father understand, but in vain. Daksha's wife, and mother of Sati, Prasuti arranged Lord Shiva and Sati's marriage, without the consent of King Daksha. He severed all ties and relations with his daughter and son-in-law and cut them out of his life. After the marriage, Sati happily made her residence at Kailash with Lord Shiva and both loved each other unconditionally. Meanwhile, Daksha had one intention, and that was to insult Lord Shiva. Deciding this, he had arranged for a ritual, in which all Gods, Goddesses and sages were invited but not Shiva and Sati. Even though discouraged by Shiva, who told her not to go to a ceremony performed by Daksha where she and her husband were not invited; the parental bond made Sati ignore social etiquette and her husband's wishes. Sati went to the ceremony alone. She was snubbed by Daksha and insulted by him in front of the guests. Sati, unable to bear further insults, immolated herself in the sacrificial yajna fire. Upon learning of the tragedy of his wife, consumed by fiery anger, rage and endless sorrow, Shiva invoked Veerbhadra and Bhadrakaali to put an end to Daksha's arrogance and to all the invitees who failed to speak out against him to protect Sati as she was offended and insulted. Upon obedience to their orders, Bhadrakali brought about great devastation to the Yajna and to the invitees present, and Veerbhadra hacked off the head of Daksha and threw it in the sacrificial fire, putting an end to him. Later, in a subsequent turn of events, Mother Goddess took another birth as King Himavan and Queen Menavati's daughter in their house, this time, she was named Parvati. She was born to parents who always respected and worshipped Lord Shiva with heart. From the Yogic point of view, the First Navratri is considered to be very auspicious day. This is the Yogic start for being in tune with the Divine Mother Durga. Those who want to have any kind of initiation in the Shakti Mantras, can have it on the First of Shukla Pratipada. The aspiration of a devotee is to reach higher and further higher, for spiritual evolution, and for the attainment of Siddhi, which is perfection associated with Ananda (bliss). Verily, Shailaputri is the Muladhara Shakti to be realized within Self and sought for higher depths, in the YOGA-maditation. This is an experience in the soul- searching of Immutable within human existence. Shailaputri is the physical consciousness of the Divine Mother Durga. She is truly Parvati, daughter of the King Hemavana, as described in the Shiva Purana. Shailaputri is the manifestation of this earth planet, which includes what is apparent on this earth, and within the globe. Shailaputri covers all the hills, vales, water resources, seas and oceans, including atmosphere. Therefore, Shailaputri is the essence of the earthly existence. Her abode is in the Muladhara Chakra. The divine Energy is latent in every human being. It is to be realized. Its color is crimson. The Tattva (element) is Earth, with the Guna (quality) of coherence, and with the Bheda (distinct) characteristics of Ghraana(the smell). Worship The puja begins with Ghatasthapana, a ritual that symbolises women power. The Ghatasthapana puja is done by using puja items that are considered holy and symbolic. A shallow pan like utensil made of clay is used as base. Three layers of mud and Sapta Dhanya/Navadhanya seeds are then scattered in the pan. After that little bit of water is needed to be sprinkled so that seeds get enough moisture. Then, a Kalasha is filled with Ganga jal. Supari, a few coins, Akshat (raw rice mixed with turmeric powder) and Durva grass are put in water. After this, five leaves of the mango tree are put around the neck of the Kalash, which is then covered by placing a coconut.  Prayers  Its mantra is La+Ma, i.e.Lama, of the Sanskrit Var·πáamƒÅlƒÅ(Sanskrit, n., ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ).

From 1864 to 1865, the OCRR's primary function was to transport oil from the oil-producing regions of Pennsylvania to the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad in Corry, Pennsylvania. In 1865 was added to the OCRR's gauge so that it could connect to standard gauge railroads like the Philadelphia and Erie. In 1866, the OCRR was extended to the Farmers Railroad in Petroleum Centre in order for oil to be moved from the Oil Creek valley region to either Corry in the north or to Oil City in the south. At this, its greatest extent, the OCRR ran 37 miles from Corry, Pennsylvania, to Petroleum Centre, Pennsylvania.

It was excavated originally in the 1930s by Harrington and then excavated twice more before being returned to for the final time in 1978 by David Hurst Thomas for a more in depth excavation.Orndorff, Richard L., Robert W. Wieder, and Harry F. Filkorn. \\"Chapter 10.\\" Geology Underfoot in Central Nevada. Missoula, MT: Mountain Pub., 2001. Print The site dates back to the early Desert Archaic Culture from c. 4000 to 2000 years ago. Thousands of Archaic artifacts have been found here, and the site \\"provides important, if unusual clues about Desert Archaic lifeways\\". Hidden Cave was not lived in, but used as storage site for goods and tools for the 2000 years of its survival.  History  Hidden Cave is located at a hilltop some from Fallon and east of Lahontan Valley. It was centered in the Toedokado Territory. The occupants resided near still water marshes where the pinon nut can be easily harvested.Thomas, David H. \\"The Archaeology of Hidden Cave, Nevada.\\" Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History 61 (1985): chap 2. Web. The cave was gouged out and created around 21,000 years ago by waves of Lake Lahontan.\\"Hidden Cave, Nevada.\\" Divisions of Anthropology. American Museum of Natural History, 2012. It was flooded until about 4,000 years ago, when the Desert Archaic people used it for year-round storage. Some say because of its location, it was a good spot for hiding valuables as well. The site was occupied during the Neoglacial period, which resulted in more rainfall in the river valleys.Fagan, Brian M. Ancient North America: The Archaeology of a Continent. 4th ed. New York: Thames & Hudson, 2005. 273, 282-283. Print. The main plant food used by the prehistoric occupants was the pinon nut.  Excavation process  For the past 10,000 years, the deposits in Hidden Cave have increased in thickness due to debris deposited on the floor through water and wind action. The most recent levels of debris blocked the entrance, making the discovery difficult. Four generations of archaeologists have worked at Hidden Cave, demonstrating that the site was used for the storage of food, tools, and for the placement of a few burials. There was a myth in the late 1800s that a robber had taken treasure and hid it in one of the caves in the Grimes Point Area. Four boys heard this myth and in 1927 went looking for the cave that had the treasure. One boy, Dick Wisenhut, felt a breeze coming from rocks right outside Hidden Cave. They squeezed their way in after removing some rocks, but were too scared explore it in detail until some six months later. The cave was their secret until a local miner, Mr. McRiley, came in and mined it for bat guano, which was a high quality fertilizer. After Mr. McRiley complained about all the Indian junk, word got out to archaeologists. McRiley's account of the cave reached Margaret Wheat, a lifelong Fallon resident and archaeologist. Wheat recognized the value and invited Mark Raymond Harrington, who had previously excavated Pueblo Grande de Nevada and Gypsum Cave, to investigate. Mark Harrington was the first archaeologist to excavate Hidden Cave. He was assisted by S.M. Wheeler in 1935. They could not find the entrance to the cave, hence Harrington‚Äôs comment, and eventual naming of the cave. They discovered an assortment of artifacts including baskets, carved wood, and worked leather.McManamon, Francis P., Linda S. Cordell, Kent G. Lightfoot, and George R. Milner. Archaeology in America: An Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2009. 281. Print. However conditions in the cave prevented substantial excavations. The problem was the amount of dust, which would get stirred up making it difficult to see and breathe. Five years later, S.M. Wheeler returned with his wife Georgette Wheeler to try and do a more in depth excavation and analysis of Hidden Cave. Together, they were known for their photography and field note-taking ability. That summer they collected over 1500 different artifacts related to the Basket Makers II and III cultures. The discovery of a horse bone indicated that the cave might have been open during the Pleistocene. The Wheelers still had a difficult time excavating due to the dust. At the end of the summer, they put up an iron gate to prevent vandalism, allow people to see what they had discovered, and to allow future archeologists to explore. The most recent excavations took place in 1979 by David Hurst Thomas. He first got there in 1967, but the dust prevented major excavation. In 1978, Thomas had wooden walkways and ramps built so people could walk around without stirring up the dust. During the summer of 1979, Thomas spent the time reanalyzing the artifacts that were never published by S.M. Wheeler‚Äôs excavations. During this time, he was able to come to the conclusion that Hidden Cave was used solely for storage year round. He also discovered close to two-dozen prehistoric storage pits. There was a series of stratigraphic layers that also helped to identify the climate the past 10,000 years. There was proof of high and low levels of Lake Lahontan, wet and dry climates, volcanic activity, and human inhabitant usage in the cave.  The discoveries  Five burials were discovered in the cave. These burials show evidence for deliberate placement. The main artifact category discovered were food remains including the pinon nuts mixed with cattail pollen. Pinon nuts are harvested in the fall whereas cattail pollen was available only in mid- summer. Bulrush seeds were also found, whose fruits are harvested six weeks after cattail pollen around the same time as the Pinon nut. Pinon nuts and bulrush are also not harvested in the same region. The combination of these three artifacts found together show that they must have been stored in the cave given their different season of occurrence. Along with just the vegetal artifacts, bone, shell, and wooden artifacts found most still fully intact, which implies they were left there for a reason, possibly for later use. There was an assortment of bone artifacts: flakes, perforated, and pendants as well as was 49 sharpened projectile points made from antler and animal bones. The pendants consisted of shaped bone. There were 143 shell artifacts consisting of clam and olivella shells. The shells were mainly used as beads. Wooden tools were very common. There was an assortment of 63 wooden weapon parts such as fore shafts, atlatls, and other weaponry pieces. Some wooden tools were located near hearths of which were eight discovered in the excavation.  Human latrine  A human latrine was discovered in the cave 1951 that contained coprolites. Their contents help prove that people during this time ate both pinon nuts and bulrush fruits at the same time even though they were not located near each other. The contents were used to infer the possibility that a 'second harvest' strategy was employed as a way to obtain undigested seeds from feces. This is a survival strategy used in times where little food resources were available.  Today  Today, the Grimes Point area is a destination for hikers and wildlife enthusiasts, and is known for its accessible petroglyphs. The cave is deep and about wide.

The game started as a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, which ran from November 29, 2012, to January 3, 2013. In the game, players build dungeons containing deadly traps to kill adventuring heroes that enter. The game is inspired by Dungeon Keeper, StarCraft, Overlord, and Evil Genius. It includes a campaign, sandbox mode, and online multiplayer. Gameplay Players construct dungeons to trap would-be heroes in a very early alpha version. In the game, players assume the role of an Underlord tasked with building dungeons that contain deadly traps and enemies to kill wandering heroes. The game starts with a blank slate and lets players choose where to \\"dig, fortify, and build\\" to create their dungeon. The game is played in real time, with the player actively making decisions while fighting occurs. Armies of minions can be trained and commanded to vanquish foes, and spells are available which can injure enemies or assist minions during battle. The game requires micromanagement to keep minions working, supplying them with food and gold. History Origins War for the Overworld started development in 2009 as a fan-made sequel to Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2. Taking its name from the subtitle of the defunct Dungeon Keeper 3, the game went through several incarnations, starting with a version based on a custom OpenGL engine, and later Unreal Development Kit, it was announced in November 2011 that a decision had been made to leave the Dungeon Keeper IP and the team finally settled on using the Unity Engine, announcing the change in June 2012. Subterranean games went on to join with another indie developer called Rise Games who had been working on Epoch Saga: Shattered Shores, a role-playing game set in Atlantis. announcing the collaboration September 2012.  Funding campaign  On November 29, 2012, Subterranean Games launched a Kickstarter campaign for their game with a ¬£150,000 goal set for January 3, 2013. For every ¬£75,000 the campaign receives, the developers plan to release one of twelve flex goals determined by vote. These goals offer extra content for the game including more multiplayer and co-op content and a dungeon crawl mode which lets players be the hero in the dungeon scenario. Backers‚Äîpeople that pledge during the campaign‚Äîare given rewards based on the size of their pledge. Rewards include beta access, a digital copy of the game, and a copy of the game's soundtrack. If the campaign reaches its base goal, the developers plan to release the game on Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on August 30, 2013, and they would additionally release a modding tool to the community. Called the Dungeoneer, it would allow users to create new maps, campaigns and game modes. On December 22, 2012 Dungeon Keeper creator Peter Molyneux praised Subterranean Games passion and strategy in making the game and asked people to pledge to the Kickstarter campaign. By December 29, 2012 the ¬£150,000 target was made through Kickstarter pledges. A total of ¬£211,371 was reached at the end of the Kickstarter campaign on January 3, 2013. Further pledges via PayPal increased the amount to over ¬£225,000 on January 6, 2013 securing the first flex goal of Richard Ridings as narrator.  Development and early releases  An Alpha version of the game, dubbed Bedrock Beta, was released on May 15, 2013, allowing players to experience the game during development, as well as assist in development by reporting bugs and giving feedback on their experience. On February 5, 2014, Subterranean Games sent out an update regarding the delayed delivery date, stating they \\"were extremely naive with our initial estimate[..] as to how long it would take to release the game\\", without issuing a new release date, instead turning to Steam Early Access.  Release  The game was released on April 2, 2015, in an unfinished state due to time and financial constraints.https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-19-the-messy-story- behind-the-making-of-war-for-the-overworld This resulted in the development team working extreme hours to release a series of patches over the following weeks and months. By September, \\"a lot of the loose ends\\" were fixed with the 1.2 patch. Subsequent patches were released over the next three years, adding features including a map editor, steam workshop support, a tower defense mode called The Crucible, and finally a scripting system for the editor in the 2.0 release.https://www.pcgamer.com/the-long-tough-journey-of-dungeon-keeper- successor-war-for-the-overworld/  Expansions  The game received a total of three expansions from 2016-2018: Heart of Gold was released on May 27, 2016.

He was born in Marsden, in Yorkshire, England, but in 1857 moved to Stalybridge, where he took a job in the local iron foundry and worked as a bouncer at the White House public house. Hurst won the English championship in his first bare-knuckle fight by defeating Tom Paddock at Aldermaston on 6 November 1861, in a contest that lasted five rounds. Paddock was suffering from the effects of a knife wound, and was unable to continue after being knocked down by a punch that broke three of his ribs. Hurst's prize money of ¬£400 is equivalent to about ¬£29,000 as of 2010. His next fight was against Jem Mace at Medway Island on 18 June 1861. At Hurst was five inches taller than his opponent, and correspondingly heavier, but he was not a skillful boxer and was no match for Mace's speed and agility. Hurst's seconds withdrew him from the fight in the eighth round, and he never fought again except in exhibition matches. A month after the unsuccessful defence of his title Hurst married the daughter of a Manchester publican, and in 1862 became landlord of the Wilton Arms in Shudehill, Manchester. He also took over the management of the beerhouse in the Botanical Gardens at Hyde in 1865, and the following year became landlord of the Glass House tavern in Manchester, where he remained until 1871.

One of the 1960s' most influential guitarists, he was described by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as \\"arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.\\" For some days prior to his death, Hendrix had been in poor health, in part from fatigue caused by overwork, a chronic lack of sleep, and an assumed influenza-related illness. Insecurities about his personal relationships, as well as disillusionment with the music industry, had also contributed to his frustration. Although the details of his final hours and death are disputed, Hendrix spent much of his last day alive with Monika Dannemann. In the morning hours of September18, Dannemann found Hendrix unresponsive in her apartment at the Samarkand Hotel, 22Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill. She called for an ambulance at 11:18 a.m., and Hendrix was taken to St Mary Abbot's Hospital, where an attempt was made to resuscitate him. He was pronounced dead at 12:45 p.m. The post-mortem examination concluded that Hendrix aspirated on his own vomit and died of asphyxia while intoxicated with barbiturates. At the inquest, the coroner, finding no evidence of suicide, and lacking sufficient evidence of the circumstances, recorded an open verdict. Dannemann stated that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping tablets, 18 times the recommended dosage. On October 1, 1970, Hendrix was interred at Greenwood Cemetery in Renton, Washington. In 1992, his former girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, asked British authorities to reopen the investigation into Hendrix's death. A subsequent inquiry by Scotland Yard proved inconclusive, and, in 1993, they decided against proceeding with an investigation. Background Jimi Hendrix was one of the most influential guitarists of the 1960s. His Rock and Roll Hall of Fame biography says he \\"was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music. Hendrix expanded the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas where no musician had ever ventured before. His boundless drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as wah-wah and distortion forever transformed the sound of rock and roll.\\" alt=A black and white photograph of a man playing an electric guitar. During the week before his death, he was dealing with two pending lawsuits, one a paternity case and the other a recording contract dispute that was due to be heard by a UK High Court the following week. He was also troubled with wanting to leave his manager, Michael Jeffery. Hendrix was fatigued and suffering from poor health, due in part to severe exhaustion caused by overworking, a chronic lack of sleep, and a persistent illness assumed to be influenza-related. Lacking trusting personal relationships, his insecurities about the future and disillusionment with the music industry contributed to his frustration. On September 11, 1970, Hendrix gave his final interview in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where he talked with Keith Altham, a journalist for Record Mirror. During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: \\"Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar\\", Hendrix replied: \\"No, I don't even let that bother me. Because they say a lot of things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today ... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy.\\" Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented psychedelic music, to which he laughed and replied: \\"A mad scientist approach ... I don't consider [my music] the invention of psychedelic, it's just asking a lot of questions.\\" The Experience in 1968 The following day, Hendrix received a phone call from one of his girlfriends, Devon Wilson, who had become jealous after hearing rumors that he was dating another woman, Kirsten Nefer. Nefer recalled: \\"I heard Jimi talk to Devon ... she was mad ... she went into fits ... Jimi said 'Devon, get off my back'\\". Hendrix was scheduled to perform in Rotterdam on September 13, but the show, along with three others, was cancelled due to Cox's incapacitation. During the evening of September 13, Nefer visited Hendrix at the Cumberland. After informing him that she would have to go back to work that evening, he convinced her to phone her boss, actor George Lazenby, and ask for the night off. Lazenby became angry and shouted over the phone to Nefer: \\"You're nothing but a fucking groupie\\", which Hendrix overheard. The exchange upset him, and he told Nefer: \\"Don't you ever go out to that guy again\\". Nefer explained to him that she had spent six months working on a film with Lazenby and that she did not want to quit her job; Hendrix eventually agreed. Nefer spent the night with him and left in the morning. Hendrix spent most of the early afternoon and evening of September 14 discussing his career plans with the record producer Alan Douglas. In the early morning hours of September 15, he went to London's Heathrow Airport with Douglas, who was returning to New York. Hendrix's confidante Sharon Lawrence was in London, and spoke with him that day. Lawrence commented: \\"Jimi tracked me down, detailing his pressures and discussing the 'so-called friends'. He was jittery and angry.\\" According to Lawrence, Hendrix told her: \\"I can't sleep. I can't focus to write any songs.\\" Later that afternoon, his girlfriend Monika Dannemann arrived at the Cumberland. She and Hendrix then drove to her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 Lansdowne Crescent, Notting Hill. During the afternoon of September 15, Hendrix was asked by his friend Eric Burdon, formerly of the Animals, if he wanted to participate in a jam session at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club with Burdon's newly formed band, War. Hendrix accepted, but when he arrived at the club that evening, he was not allowed to play due to his apparently drug- related disorientation. Burdon commented: \\"Jimi came down and was well out of it. He ... was wobbling too much to play, so I told him to come back the following night.\\" Hendrix returned the next night and presented a healthier appearance. The crowd was enthusiastic and impressed by his performance despite his uncharacteristically subdued guitar playing when he sat in with War on \\"Tobacco Road\\" and \\"Mother Earth\\". This was the last time Hendrix played guitar in public. Final hours Late morning and early afternoon thumbleftalt=A color image of a man sitting at a table in the outdoors holding a black guitar.One of the last photographs of Hendrix, at the Samarkand Hotel, September 17, 1970 Although the details of Hendrix's last day and death are unclear and widely disputed, he had spent much of September 17 in London with Monika Dannemann.: Hendrix spending most of September 17 with Dannemann and Dannemann as the only eyewitness to Hendrix's final hours; ; : the disputed details of Hendrix's final hours and death; : uncertainty in the specific details of his final hours and death. He awoke late that morning at Dannemann's apartment in the Samarkand Hotel. By around 2p.m., he was sitting in a garden area outside the apartment enjoying some tea while she took photographs of him holding his favorite Fender Stratocaster guitar that he called \\"Black Beauty\\". In the opinion of author Tony Brown, \\"Jimi doesn't look particularly healthy in these photographs: his face seems a little puffy and on only a few of the pictures does he attempt to smile.\\" According to Dannemann, by 3p.m. they had left the apartment to use a bank. They continued on to Kensington Market, where Hendrix signed an autograph for a young boy, purchased a leather jacket, and ordered some shoes. He also briefly spoke with his ex-girlfriend Kathy Etchingham, inviting her to visit him at his hotel that evening at 8p.m.; she declined the invitation due to prior engagements and later admitted that she had \\"regretted it ever since\\". Hendrix and Dannemann then went to a Chelsea antiques market, where Hendrix purchased more clothing. After another stop to buy writing paper, which he used to compose his final lyrics, Dannemann and Hendrix drove to his suite at the Cumberland Hotel, meeting Devon Wilson as she walked down King's Road. Hendrix asked Dannemann to stop the car so that he could get out and talk with Wilson, who invited Hendrix to a party that evening. Dannemann became jealous, giving Wilson a cold stare during the brief meeting. Later, Phillip Harvey invited Dannemann and Hendrix to tea; they accepted. Prior to their arrival at Harvey's, they briefly stopped by the Cumberland. While at the hotel, Hendrix made several telephone calls. Dannemann said he phoned his lawyer Henry Steingarten, asking him to find a way out of his contract with his manager Mike Jeffery, and producer Eddie Kramer, for whom Hendrix left a voice message. Mitch Mitchell said that he called Hendrix at the Cumberland on September 17, after having been asked to do so by tour manager Gerry Stickells, who had spoken to Hendrix just minutes earlier. Mitchell said that during the phone conversation Hendrix agreed to join him around midnight at the Speakeasy Club for a previously arranged jam session, which included Sly Stone.: (primary source); : (secondary source). Late afternoon and evening After stopping at the Cumberland, Hendrix and Dannemann accompanied Harvey to his apartment, arriving around 5:30 p.m. Hendrix and Dannemann smoked hashish and drank tea and wine with Harvey and two of his female companions while discussing their individual careers. Sometime around 10p.m., Dannemann, apparently feeling left out of the conversation and jealous of the attention Hendrix was giving Harvey's female friends, became visibly upset and stormed out of the flat. Hendrix followed her, and an argument ensued between them during which Dannemann reportedly shouted: \\"you fucking pig\\". Harvey, concerned that their yelling would draw unwanted attention from the police, asked them to quiet down. Harvey, who had remained silent about the incident out of respect for his English nobleman father, Arthur Vere Harvey, gave an affidavit after his father's death in 1994. In his statement, he claims to have been mildly concerned for Hendrix's safety, worried that Dannemann might \\"resort to serious physical violence\\". According to Harvey, Dannemann \\"verbally assaulted [Hendrix] in the most offensive possible way\\". Approximately 30 minutes later, Hendrix re-entered the flat and apologized for the outburst before leaving with Dannemann at 10:40 p.m. Dannemann said she then prepared a meal for them at her apartment around 11p.m. and shared a bottle of wine with Hendrix. Sometime after returning to the apartment, Hendrix took a bath, then wrote a poem titled \\"The Story of Life\\". Early morning At approximately 1:45 a.m. on Friday, September 18, Dannemann drove Hendrix to the party Wilson had invited him to earlier that day, which was hosted by Hendrix's acquaintance and business associate, Pete Kameron. At the party, Hendrix complained to Kameron about business problems, ate some food, and took at least one amphetamine tablet. Approximately 30 minutes later, Dannemann rang the flat's intercom asking for Hendrix. Another guest, Stella Douglas, asked her to return later. According to guest Angie Burdon, the estranged wife of Eric Burdon of the Animals, when Dannemann came back around 15 minutes later, Douglas used an assertive approach with her to the point of being impolite. Undeterred, Dannemann demanded to speak with Hendrix. Burdon recalled: \\"[Hendrix] got angry because [Dannemann] wouldn't leave him alone.\\" According to Burdon, other guests at the party shouted out the windows at Dannemann, asking her to leave. Hendrix eventually yielded and spoke with Dannemann before unexpectedly leaving the party around 3a.m. Dannemann, the only eyewitness to Hendrix's final hours, said that sometime after 3a.m., she prepared two tuna fish sandwiches for them after arriving back at her basement apartment. Around 4a.m., Hendrix, struggling with insomnia after having consumed amphetamines hours earlier, asked her for sleeping tablets. She later said she refused his request hoping he would fall asleep naturally. Dannemann said she surreptitiously took a sleeping tablet sometime around 6a.m., with Hendrix still awake. She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20 a.m. to find him sleeping normally in bed next to her.: Dannemann secretly taking a sleeping tablet around 6 a.m. and waking at 10:20 a.m (direct quote); : Dannemann secretly taking a sleeping tablet around 6 a.m. (secondary source); : Dannemann waking at 10 a.m. She said she then left to purchase cigarettes, and when she returned around 11a.m., found him in bed breathing, although unconscious and unresponsive. She telephoned for an ambulance at 11:18 a.m. and one arrived at 11:27 a.m. When ambulance crew members Reg Jones and John Saua arrived at the Samarkand, the door to the flat was wide open, the gas fire was on, the curtains were drawn, and the apartment was dark. The crew called out several times, but after receiving no response, they entered and found Hendrix alone in bed. Dannemann was nowhere to be found. According to Jones: \\"Well, we had to get the police, we only had [Hendrix] and an empty flat, so John ran up and radioed, and got the aspirator ... It was horrific. He was covered in vomit. There was tons of it all over the pillow‚Äîblack and brown it was. His airway was completely blocked all the way down ... We felt his pulse ... showed a light in his eyes. But there was no response at all.\\" At 11:30 a.m., police officers Ian Smith and Tom Keene responded to a call for police assistance from the ambulance control centre. Jones commented: \\"Once the police arrived, which seemed like no time at all, we got [Hendrix] off to hospital as quick as we could.\\" The ambulance crew left the hotel at approximately 11:35 a.m. to take Hendrix to St Mary Abbot's Hospital and they arrived at 11:45 a.m. Medical registrar Dr. Martin Seifert stated: \\"Jimi was rushed into the [resuscitation] room. He was put on a monitor, but it [ECG trace] was flat. I pounded his heart [CPR] a couple of times, but there was no point, he was dead\\". According to Seifert, the attempt to resuscitate Hendrix lasted \\"just a few minutes\\". The surgical registrar, Dr. John Bannister, commented: \\"He was cold and he was blue. He had all the parameters of someone who had been dead for some time. We worked on him for about half an hour without any response at all.\\" Bannister pronounced Hendrix dead at 12:45 p.m., on Friday, September 18, 1970; he was 27 years old. He later stated: \\"On admission he was obviously dead. He had no pulse, no heartbeat, and the attempt to resuscitate him was merely a formality.\\" Media response During the morning of September 18, Eric Burdon arrived at the Samarkand sometime before the ambulance crew and found that Hendrix was already dead. Burdon immediately became concerned that police would find drugs at the apartment, and as he was collecting incriminating evidence, he found the poem that Hendrix had written hours earlier, \\"The Story of Life\\".; Burdon collecting incriminating evidence; : Burdon as one of the first people to arrive at the Samarkand during the morning of September 18, 1970. Burdon, who said he had previously discussed suicide and death with Hendrix, assumed the poem was a suicide note. Under this assumption, he made comments to the press regarding his belief that Hendrix had committed suicide that he has since recanted: \\"I made false statements ... I simply didn't understand what the situation was. I misread the note ... I thought it was a goodbye\\". Dannemann said Hendrix told her: \\"I want you to keep this [poem] forever [and] I don't want you to forget anything that is written. It's a story about you and me\\". Soon after Bannister pronounced Hendrix dead, a hospital spokesperson told the press: \\"We don't know where, how, or why he died, but he died of an overdose.\\" By that evening, many newspapers in London and New York had printed sensationalized headlines that exploited the death-from-overdose account.; . Hendrix's public relations manager, Les Perrin, granted an interview on Dutch radio soon after the hospital announcement. He commented: \\"Well, all I know is that Mr. Hendrix's body was taken to St. Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington, London, at 11:45 this morning, and he was certified to be dead on arrival.\\" At 2p.m., BBC Radio 1 reported: \\"Jimi Hendrix, regarded by millions as one of the most talented and original performers in modern rock music, is dead.\\" That evening, The New York Times described him as \\"a genius black musician, a guitarist, singer and composer of brilliantly dramatic power. He spoke in gestures as big as he could imagine and create.\\" On September 19, Dannemann spoke with a journalist for the German tabloid Bild. During the interview, published on September 24, Dannemann stated: \\"I loved him, and Jimi loved me ... We were already engaged ... I would then have designed the sleeves for his records ... He could not sleep. So I gave him the tablets.\\" On September 20, a reporter from The Daily Telegraph interviewed Dannemann's brother, Klaus-Peter Dannemann, who stated: \\"[Monika] telephoned me on [September 19] and told me that [Hendrix] took nine sleeping tablets. She said that Jimi had told her that he wanted to sleep for a day and a half before he went to America. She told me that he did not intend to kill himself.\\" Post-mortem To determine the cause of death, the coroner, Gavin Thurston, ordered a post-mortem examination on Hendrix's body, which was performed on September 21, by Professor Robert Donald Teare, a forensic pathologist. Teare reported that Hendrix was \\"well nourished and muscular\\", and he identified a quarter-inch scar on Hendrix's left wrist. He said that there were \\"no stigmata of [intravenous] drug addiction. Once these marks are there [in the skin], they never go away. In this case, there were no marks at all.\\" Although Teare observed that the right side of Hendrix's heart was widely dilated, he found no evidence of valvular heart disease. He discovered a partially collapsed left lung and 400 ml of fluid in Hendrix's chest. Both lungs were congested, and vomit was found in the smaller bronchi. According to Teare, Hendrix's stomach \\"contained a medium-sized partially digested meal in which rice could be distinguished.\\" Teare concluded that Hendrix's kidneys were healthy, and his liver was congested. His \\"bladder was half full of clear urine.\\" He stated that Hendrix's blood alcohol content was 100 mg per 100 ml, \\"enough to fail a breathalyzer test ... the equivalent of about four pints of beer.\\": \\"the equivalent of about four pints of beer\\"; : Hendrix's blood alcohol content was an insignificant 100 mg per 100 mls. Teare reported that analysis of Hendrix's blood \\"revealed a mixture of barbiturates consistent with those from Vesparax\\", and he estimated that drug concentrations translated to ingestion of 1.8 grams of barbiturate, 20 mg of amphetamine, and 20 mg of cannabis.: \\"a mixture of barbiturates consistent with those from Vesparax\\"; : Teare estimated that Hendrix had ingested 1.8 grams of barbiturate, 20 mg of amphetamine, and 20 mg of cannabis. Teare gave the cause of death as: \\"Inhalation of vomit due to barbiturate intoxication.\\" He did not attempt to determine Hendrix's time of death. Thurston began an inquest on September 23, and on September 28 he concluded that Hendrix had aspirated his own vomit and died of asphyxia while intoxicated with barbiturates.: Coroner Gavin Thurston's September 28 inquest; : Hendrix's September 21 autopsy. Citing \\"insufficient evidence of [the] circumstances\\", he recorded an open verdict. He commented: \\"The cause of death was clearly inhalation of vomit due to barbiturate intoxication, but there is no evidence as to intention to commit suicide ... If the question of intention cannot be answered, then it is proper to find the cause of death and leave it an open verdict.\\" Dannemann later stated that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping tablets. Intended to be taken in half-tablet doses, nine tablets of the powerful sedative amounted to 18 times the recommended amount.; . After Hendrix's body had been embalmed by Desmond Henley, it was flown to Seattle, Washington, on September 29. After a service at Dunlap Baptist Church on October 1, he was interred at Greenwood Cemetery in Renton, Washington, the location of his mother's gravesite. Hendrix's family and friends traveled in 24 limousines. More than two hundred people attended the funeral, including several notable musicians such as the original Experience members Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, as well as Miles Davis, John Hammond and Johnny Winter. Inconsistencies and the Scotland Yard inquiry Tony Brown, author of Jimi Hendrix: The Final Days (1997), had been in regular contact with Dannemann from 1980 until her death in 1996. He visited with her on multiple occasions and spoke with her numerous times over the phone. Soon after contacting her, Brown came to the conclusion that her account of the events of Hendrix's final days \\"would change from one call to the next.\\" In the days following Hendrix's death, she gave two significantly different accounts of the morning of September 18. At approximately 4p.m. on September 18, Dannemann told Police Sergeant John Shaw: \\"We went to sleep about 7 a.m. When I woke up at eleven his face was covered in vomit, and he was breathing noisily. I sent for an ambulance, and he was taken to hospital. I also noticed that ten of my sleeping tablets were missing.\\" In a statement given to P. Weyell of the coroner's office on September 24, she said: > I made a sandwich and we talked until about 7 a.m. He then said that he > wanted to go to sleep. He took some tablets, and we went to bed. I woke up > about 11:00 a.m., and saw that Jimi's face was covered in vomit. I tried to > wake him but could not. I called an ambulance and he was taken to the > hospital in Kensington ... Prior to going with him to the hospital, I > checked my supply of Vesparax sleeping tablets and found that nine of them > were missing. In Dannemann's initial statements, she said she awoke at 11a.m. on September 18. During the inquest she stated that she awoke at 10:20 a.m., and left to purchase cigarettes, something she had previously failed to mention. In 1971, she wrote a manuscript in which she said she awoke at 10a.m. In 1975, during an interview with author Caesar Glebbeek, Dannemann stated that she awoke at 9a.m. According to Burdon, Dannemann phoned him as \\"the first light of dawn was coming through the window.\\" Stickells said he received a phone call regarding a problem with Hendrix \\"between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m.\\" Mitchell said he waited for Hendrix at the Speakeasy Club until they closed at 4a.m., and a couple of hours after his hour and a half drive home, he received a phone call from Stickells, who told him Hendrix had died. In her statements to the police and coroner's office, Dannemann never mentioned telephoning Burdon. Although Dannemann claimed that Hendrix was alive when placed in the ambulance at approximately 11:30 a.m. and that she rode with him on the way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there.: Dannemann claiming to have rode with to the hospital; : paramedics denying that Dannemann was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27 a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: \\"[When] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed.\\" Saua stated: \\"There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else.\\" Burdon stated: \\"[Dannemann] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me\\". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: \\"When we moved [Hendrix], the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died\\". According to police officer Smith: \\"The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead ... There was really nothing they could do for him.\\" Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: > No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi ... > there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have > called us to come ... But because no one was there, he was dead, and > circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed ... us in. It > wasn't until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: \\"There was no one else, except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor did anyone else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital.\\" In 1992, having arranged for a private investigation of Hendrix's death, Etchingham supplied the results of the effort to UK authorities and requested they reopen the coroner's inquest.: (primary source); : (secondary source); : (additional secondary source). After a several-month inquiry by Scotland Yard, during which every interested party to the events was interviewed, officials were confident the request would be granted. The investigation eventually proved inconclusive in 1993, when Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell decided that proceeding with the investigation would not serve the public, due in part to the excessive time that had passed since Hendrix's death.: (primary source); : (secondary source); : (additional secondary source).

Given a set of C/C++ type declarations, the compiler-based gSOAP tools generate serialization routines in source code for efficient XML serialization of the specified C and C++ data structures. Serialization takes zero-copy overhead.  History  The gSOAP toolkit started as a research project at the Florida State University by professor Robert van Engelen in 1999. The project introduced new methods for highly- efficient XML parsing (pull parsing) and serialization of C/C++ data directly in XML and later also in SOAP. The project succeeded at defining type-safe data bindings between XML schema types and a wide variety of C/C++ data types. The toolkit uses automatic programming to simplify the development and invocation of Web services using efficient auto-generated XML serializers to send and receive C/C++ data directly. A domain-specific compiler-based tool generates source code that efficiently converts native C/C++ data structures to XML and back. The toolkit was further developed to support the SOAP web services messaging protocol, introduced at around the same time, therefore the name \\"gSOAP\\" (generic XML and SOAP) and to use the approach for scientific data exchange. Further development and maintenance of the software took place under ownership of Genivia Inc. This includes the addition of new WSDL and XML schema processing capabilities as well as the addition of many WS-* web services protocol capabilities such as WS-Security optimizations, XML-RPC messaging, support for the JSON data format, plugin modules to integrate gSOAP in Apache and IIS web servers, and third-party plugins such as for Grid Services. The gSOAP toolkit is written in portable C/C++ and uses a form of bootstrapping by generating its own code to implement a converter to translate WSDL/XSD specifications to C/C++ source code for WSDL/XSD meta-data bindings. The gSOAP software is licensed under the GPLv2 open source license and commercial-use source code licenses. The gSOAP software is widely used in industrial projects and mission-critical infrastructures.  XML Web Service Operations by Example  An example web service operation in C for retrieving the lodging rate of a hotel given a number of guests can be declared in annotated form as //gsoap ns service namespace: tempuri //gsoap ns service style: document //gsoap ns service encoding: literal int ns__get_rate(char* hotel, int guests, float *rate); The last parameter of the function is always the service return value, which can be denoted as void for one-way operations and should be a struct/class to bundle multiple service return parameters. The function's int return value is used for error diagnostics. A service invocation in C using the auto-generated soap_call_ns__get_rate function is executed as follows: const char *URL = \\"http://www.example.com/hotels\\"; const char *action = NULL; struct soap *ctx = soap_new(); // new context float rate; int err = soap_call_ns__get_rate(ctx, URL, action, \\"Happy Inn\\", 2, &rate;); if (err  SOAP_OK && rate < 100.00) lets_go(); soap_end(ctx); // deallocate deserialized data soap_free(ctx); // deallocate context To facilitate web services implementations for legacy C and C++ systems, the prefix qualification of identifier names in C/C++ can be omitted or can be replaced by colon notation, for example ns:get_rate rather than ns__get_rate. The punctuation is removed in the auto-generated source code that is used in project builds. A service invocation in C++ using the auto-generated Proxy class is executed as follows (using the Proxy's default endpoint URL and SOAP action values): Proxy proxy; float rate; int err = proxy.get_rate(\\"Happy Inn\\", 2, &rate;); if (err  SOAP_OK && rate < 100.00) lets_go(); proxy.destroy(); // deallocate deserialized data By using annotations and identifier naming conventions, i.e. qualification with the prefix ns__ for the function ns__get_rate and by declaring properties of the ns namespace using the //gsoap directives in the example, a binding is established to web service operations. The auto-generated Web Services Description Language (WSDL) document declares a request message, a response message, and the get-rate operation portType interface and SOAP binding for the ns__get_rate function as follows: ... where the request and responses messages of the operation refer to XML elements that are defined in the types section of the WSDL as follows: Likewise, client and server C/C++ source code can be auto-generated from a set of WSDLs and XML schemas. Services must be completed by defining the appropriate service operations. For example, the auto-generated C++ service class for this WSDL must be completed by defining the get_rate method as follows: int Service::get_rate(char *hotel, int guests, float *rate) { *rate = ... // determine the lodging rate of the hotel given the number of guests return SOAP_OK; } There are no restrictions on the type of the operation parameters that can be marshaled in XML for web service messaging, except that certain type declaration conventions and annotations should be followed to establish a data binding.  XML Data Binding by Example  To establish an XML data binding with C/C++ data types, gSOAP uses three basic forms of source code annotation: directives, identifier naming conventions, and punctuation. A fully annotated structure declaration in C for a hierarchical employee record may appear as //gsoap ns schema namespace: tempuri //gsoap ns schema form: qualified struct ns__employee_record { @char *xml__lang = \\"en\\"; @int ID = 9999; char *full_name 1:1; $int size 0:12; struct ns__employee_record *manages; }; where the following annotations and conventions are used: * namespace qualification of types and members by identifier naming conventions: ns__employee_record, xml__lang * attributes for members: @char*, @int * default values for members: xml__lang = \\"en\\", ID = 9999 * occurrence constraints in the form of minOccurs:maxOccurs for XML validation: full_name 1:1, size 0:12 * dynamic arrays of element sequences consist of a pair of a special size field and an array pointer member: $int size; struct ns__employee_record *manages The gSOAP tools convert C/C++ data types to/from XML schema data types. Since C does not support namespaces and struct/class member names cannot be namespace-qualified in C++, the use of identifier naming conventions in gSOAP allow for binding this structure and its members to an XML schema complexType that is auto-generated as follows: Furthermore, unions in a struct/class that are annotated with a special selector field for union member selection are mapped to/from schema choice particles, STL containers are mapped to/from sequence particles, enumerations are mapped to/from XML schema simpleType enumerations, and standard C/C++ primitive types are mapped to/from XSD types. For conversion of XSD schema to C/C++ data types, the actual mapping is configurable in gSOAP with a type mapping file. An instance of the example hierarchical employee structure is serialized in XML as a tree by default, for example Jane Doe John Doe Bob Oz Alice Oz When the SOAP encoding style is enabled, the XML serialization in gSOAP respects co-referenced objects and cyclic data structures as per SOAP encoding rules resulting in XML with id-ref edges. The auto-generated XML data binding includes read and write operations to/from a file, string or stream. For example, an ns__employee_record object has read and write operations: int soap_read_ns__employee_record(struct soap*, ns__employee_record*); int soap_write_ns__employee_record(struct soap*, const ns__employee_record*); To read an employee record from an XML file: struct soap *ctx = soap_new(); ctx->recvfd = open(\\"employee.xml\\", O_RDONLY); if (ctx->recvfd) { ns__employee_record employee; if (soap_read_ns__employee_record(ctx, &employee;)  SOAP_OK) ... close(ctx->recvfd); } soap_end(ctx); soap_destroy(ctx); // also deletes employee data soap_free(ctx); Parsed XML is internally validated against the data bindings' constraints.  XML REST API  Application data can be sent and received to/from a REST XML service. The XML data binding provides REST XML API calls. For example, given the ns__employee_record XML data binding of the previous section, the following GET, PUT and POST operations are auto-generated: int soap_GET_ns__employee_record(struct soap*, const char *URL, ns__employee_record*); int soap_PUT_ns__employee_record(struct soap*, const char *URL, const ns__employee_record*); int soap_POST_send_ns__employee_record(struct soap*, const char *URL, const ns__employee_record*); int soap_POST_recv_ns__employee_record(struct soap*, ns__employee_record*); The POST functions should be called together, first a POST_send to transmit XML data to the endpoint URL followed by a POST_recv to accept the response data (may be of a different type). Received XML is internally validated against the data bindings' constraints.

Life  According to the register of deaths in the Church of Surp Takavor in Kadƒ±k√∂y, Yazmaciyan was born in √úsk√ºdar and his wife's name was Deruni. Garabet Yazmaciyan came from a family of three children who were born and grew up in √úsk√ºdar. He was an introvert man, and a skilled violinist. His first wife was a relative of Nubar Pasha and twenty years older than himself, died four years after they got married. Yazmaciyan's house burned down 70 years ago, and nothing but a few paintings were saved. While carrying these paintings to a friend's shop in Kadƒ±k√∂y, he was attacked and beaten by thieves, who took the paintings. For some time after this, Yazmaciyan was unable to speak from shock. He lived in the shop of this same friend in Kadƒ±k√∂y for a while, until he made the acquittance of a widow named Sirpuhi, whose daughter was studying Latin in Italy. Sirpuhi and Garabet ended up getting married. After the daughter of Sirpuhi, Alis, returned from Italy, the family moved to Cevizli and eight months later Garabet Yazamaciyan died of a heart attack.  Style  Yazmacƒ±yan used scenery, color harmonies, and subjects that are of very close resemblance to Mƒ±gƒ±rdi√ß Civanyan (1848-1906). His brushstrokes however are a little more careless and sloven. In order to be able to make a living from painting like Civanyan, Yazmacƒ±yan had to produce quite quickly. Yazmaciyan also painted for the local Armenian churches. His paintings for the churches are more elaborate, attentive, and refined. One of his more interesting works of art existing today is the double-sided tin shop sign he painted for his own business. On one of the sides, the artist has depicted himself painting. On the rear of the sign one can see a still-life painting. This proclaimed to the potential customers that he was open to conduct business and receive orders of both still life and portraits. In a way this shop sign is also proof that a painter in late 19th and early 20th century Istanbul was at the same time a tradesman. Similarly this fact suggests that paintings during that period were seen as objects. They were ordered and considered as goods in the Ottoman society and economy, especially among the non-Muslim minorities. The Alluring Woman with Poison in her Mouth is also one of Yazmaciyan more interesting works. This painting depicts a naked man standing and is wrapped around a half-snake half-human Basilisk that has long claws similar to nails. The Basilisk appears as though it is looking up to god; enraged at being unable to fulfill her desires. There is a stark contrast between the pink body of the man against the blue-black snake like creature with red tinsels. What is open to discussion however is the content of the red-white bohemian cup the man is holding and what it symbolizes.

The founders of these bakeries agreed not to compete in bread for ten years. Weston and Stuart immediately formed new baking companies making biscuits and cakes. Weston Bakeries reentered the bread market in 1921, becoming over time a major competitor to Canada Bread. Over a span of 30 years, the company quickly grew, purchasing over 20 bakeries in a dozen cities across the country and establishing new bakery locations in Kingston, Ontario, Cornwall, Ontario, Kirkland Lake, Ontario, Chatham, Ontario and Sudbury, Ontario. In 1968, the company acquired Dempster's Bread Limited, which had become the nation's best- selling brand of bread. It followed this acquisition in 1969 by changing the name of the company to Corporate Foods Limited, but later reverted to Canada Bread Company, Limited in 1997. Quebec-based Multi-Marques, with its brand POM, was acquired in 2001. In May 2014, Canada Bread was purchased from Maple Leaf Foods by Mexican-based bakery organization, Grupo Bimbo.

Artistry Metropolis I His works, like that of his brother Antonio, tend to deal with urban themes often about human decadence. Images are not realistic and generally distorted. Mauricio‚Äôs works often contain urban landscapes with a chaotic feel. The Aus der Tiefe series deals with the violence in human society, which Mauricio has said continues to grow. Maurico considers his works to be cathartic, especially for him as he paints.) He states that his main influences are Francisco Goya, Francis Bacon and Giovanni Battista Piranesi as well as German Expressionism, and Goya‚Äôs Black Paintings. He mostly uses acrylics because they dry faster than oils. According to art critic Carlos Blas Galindo, Garc√≠a Vega‚Äôs works are meant to disquiet, move, impact, impress, surprise and amaze onlookers. His images can evoke a sense of terror, the sublime, the sinister, the grotesque, the brutal and the dramatic. His works are often done in diptychs and triptychs.

The ship is named after the American Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry (1785‚Äì1819), the hero of the naval Battle of Lake Erie (1813).  Description  It measures , and is a three-masted square-rigged vessel, making it the largest privately owned tall ship and largest civilian sail training vessel in the United States. The SSV Oliver Hazard Perry sails as Rhode Island‚Äôs Official Sailing School Vessel and \\"good will ambassador\\" for the state, as well as a \\"floating classroom\\". It teaches students STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) lessons while applying it to the practical activities they learn how to do on the ship. It is being financed through a tax exempt 501(c)(3) charitable foundation, and public subscription. The ship, when acquired by the Rhode Island trust for $325,000, was a steel hull, built by an organization in Ontario. It had cost almost $3 million to build. However the Canadian group derailed before the ship could be completed, leaving the Rhode Islanders at liberty to purchase it. The Canadians had intended it to be a replica of the 20-gun British ship (1813) (captured by the flotilla commanded by Commodore Perry; not the six gun sloop (1816) destroyed by Lieutenant Jesse D. Elliott in the War of 1812). On July 16, 2015, the Perry set sail for the first time on a voyage to Portland, ME. During that voyage it made a stop in Provincetown, MA. While in Maine the Perry participated in the parade of sail during the 2015 Portland Tall Ships festival. The ship also made a visit to New London, CT, for the 2015 Connecticut Maritime Heritage Festival. On October 15, 2017, the ship lost power while leaving the Newport, RI seafood festival. It drifted into several boats and sat grounded overnight in Newport Harbor.http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20171015/ris-tall-ship-oliver- hazard-perry-loses-power-in-newport-harbor-drifts-into-boats-runs-aground An on scene eye witness said power was not lost till grounding (sucking mud). What was lost was control in high wind. After repairs were made, the ship set sail again, fulfilling its mission as an educational vessel, hosting students from high schools, the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps (USNSCC), and the Naval Academy Prep School.

He was Folha de S.Paulos editorial director since 1984, as well as Grupo Folha's editorial director. Biography Eldest son of Octavio Frias de Oliveira, an entrepreneur who bought the company responsible for Folha in 1962, Frias Filho started to work for the newspaper in 1975, writing editorials and helping out journalist Cl√°udio Abramo, who headed the newsroom. He took part in the editorial reforms conducted by Octavio Frias and Abramo during that period, which resulted in opening Folha's pages to political and intellectual figures of all stripes, taking advantage of the political opening then being promoted by the military regime. This pluralistic viewpoint earned respect for Folha and brought it closer to the civilian society. As newsroom director, Frias Filho systematized and developed the newspaper's experiences during the political opening and Diretas J√° periods. A series of documents circulated periodically defined the newspaper's editorial project as part of the so-called Projeto Folha, defined by critical, unbiased and pluralistic news coverage. Those same principles oriented Folha's Newsroom Manual, launched in 1984 and updated on several occasions since.Circulo Folha - Manual da Reda√ß√£o More than a style guide, it serves as a guide to the rules and commitments Folha works under. It was the first publication of its kind to be made available to the general public in Brazil. The guidelines stipulate that all journalism must be descriptive and accurate, but that themes that cause controversy can admit to more than one viewpoint and require a pluralistic treatment. Folha became known also for its highly diverse selection of columnists. At the same time, checks and balances were instituted through internal controls: the Manual, the daily ‚ÄúCorrections‚Äù section adopted in 1991, a rule stating that objections to any article expressed by readers or people mentioned in the news should be printed, and, above all, the ombudsman position, created in 1989;Folha Ombudsman - o que √© o cargo? this position entails job security for its holder, whose aim is to criticize Folha and deal with complaints by readers and people mentioned in the news. From the midpoint of the Brazilian military rule, Folha has kept a critical stance towards several succeeding administrations (Ernesto Geisel, Jo√£o Figueiredo, Jos√© Sarney, Fernando Collor, Itamar Franco). Otavio Frias Filho was sued, with three of Folhas reporters, by then President Fernando Collor. The newspaper's coverage about the administrations of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) and Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva (PT) led to accusations of anti-governmental bias in both cases, though the two Presidents belong to rival parties. Beginning with the exposure of a massive fraud on the Ferrovia Norte-Sul (1985), and through the Mensal√£o scandal (2005), Folha kept revealing abuses and misrule. In 1991, Frias Filho accepted, on behalf of Folha, the Maria Moors Cabot Award, granted by Columbia University.\\"Four Journalists Named as Winners of 1991 Cabot Prizes\\". Associated Press, Oct. 30, 1991 Frias died on 21 August 2018, aged 61, in his hometown of S√£o Paulo from pancreatic cancer.Ot√°vio Frias Filho, diretor de reda√ß√£o da Folha de S.Paulo, morre em SP Literature Frias Filho wrote six theatre plays, three of which were published under the title ‚ÄúTutankaton‚Äù (Editora Iluminuras, 1991), accompanied by essays on culture. Four of those plays were staged in S√£o Paulo: ‚ÄúT√≠pico Rom√¢ntico‚Äù (1992), ‚ÄúRancor‚Äù (1993), ‚ÄúDon Juan‚Äù (1995) and ‚ÄúSonho de N√∫pcias‚Äù (2002). He wrote ‚ÄúQueda Livre‚Äù (Companhia das Letras, 2003), collecting pieces labeled as ‚Äúparticipative investigations‚Äù - seven essay-length reports on experiences that entail psychological risk. He also wrote children's books - ‚ÄúO Livro da 1¬™ Vez‚Äù (Cosac Naify, 2004) and short stories that were published as part of children's collections ‚ÄúO Livro dos Medos‚Äù (1998) and ‚ÄúVice-versa ao Contr√°rio‚Äù (1993), both by Companhia das Letrinhas.

The estate has a large park with public access. The main building was demolished in 1984. The estate, covering , contains the thatched tenant farm of Egel√∏kke. Manorial records exist from 1769, though earlier records may exist in the M√∏n Cavalry District records. History In 1668, Frederik III gave Captain Jacob Nielsen several estates on M√∏n, including the Nyg√•rd farm, as a reward for his having captured a Swedish ship and brought it back to Copenhagen with its cargo and Danish prisoners of war. Nielsen apparently only kept it for a short period. Later, a manor was built there as the residence of Samuel Christoph von Plessen, who in 1685 was appointed governor of M√∏n. Plessen used bricks from Stege's town wall for the building. When he was relieved of his position of governor in 1697, the house was totally or partially demolished. Casper Gottlob Moltke, who was governor from 1703 to 1728, tidied up the estate and built a new manor house in 1707. In 1739-47, Count Adam Gottlob Moltke resided on the estate but handed it over to the new governor, Frederik Christian von M√∏sting, against a payment of 6,000 rigsdaler for the building. In 1769, von M√∏sting transferred the estate to the Crown in return for compensation for the building.\\"Marienborg\\", Roskilde Historie. Retrieved 11 December 2012. When the Crown sold the property in 1769, it was bought by local farmers but as they were unable to afford the full payment, Regimental Quartermaster Esaias Fleischer from N√¶stved, together with Magnus Bering Beringskjold, bought it instead. Shortly afterwards, Beringskjold took the property over himself, naming it Marienborg after his wife Marie Kirstine von Cappelen. Being unable to make a payment, in 1776, Beringskjold sold the estate in turn to Charles Fran√ßois de Bosc de la Calmette, whose son Antoine de Bosc de la Calmette, remembered for the romantic English landscape garden he laid out at Liselund on M√∏n, took it over after the father's death in 1781, calling the manor Calmettenborg.\\"Antoine de la Calmette\\", Dansk Biografisk Leksikon. Retrieved 10 December 2012. On Antoine's death in 1781, his son Charles Bosc de la Calmette inherited the estate, and on his death it was sold in 1821 to the master of the royal hunt, Peter Adolph Tutein, who also bought Kostervig. In 1853-1855, he built a new building with a tower in the style of an Italian palace to a design by architect Vilhelm Theodor Walther; in 1888, the estate was bought by Hemming Moltke, who in 1893 demolished the old main building from Casper Moltke's time and built instead a new building with a tower designed by architect Axel Berg. A fire destroyed several of the estates buildings in 1908. Moltke's widow Clara Moltke left the estate in 1948 to her grandson P. C. F. G. Moltke. Marienborg today Marienborg now consists of a farming and forestry estate in West M√∏n, specializing in pig rearing. Of a total of 1,392 ha, 370 ha are forest.

It is governed by the Aloha Community Library Association (ACLA), which is registered as a non-profit organization in the State of Oregon and a 501(c)(3). The library opened September 22, 2012. History The library originated from an idea within a local quasi- governmental community group called Citizen Participation Organization 6 (CPO-6), which encompasses the unincorporated areas of Aloha, Reedville and Cooper Mountain, in Washington County. Aloha community activist and political entrepreneur Eric Squires was primarily responsible for the initial planning for the library, forming a work group within CPO-6. Squires also serves as one of nine on the board of directors, with Doug Hoy as the president of that board. The library is a citizen-initiated effort in an unincorporated urban area of Washington County surrounded by the cities of Beaverton to the east, and Hillsboro to the west. Washington County Planning Commissioner Anthony R. Mills was also involved with planning for the creation of the library. The library was opened in a space within a strip mall on Farmington Road at Kinnaman Road anchored by Bales Thriftway. At the time of its opening, it had about 4,500 books, and a total collection of 6,000 items. The opening was attended by Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, County Commission Chair Andy Duyck, and Commissioner Dick Schouten. The Aloha Community Library also provides internet access, printing, DVDs, and a device assisting the vision impaired with optical magnification. The library is currently a community library, as it self-funded, but aspires to become part of Washington County Cooperative Library Services (WCCLS) in the 2015-2016 tax levy year, the first year the library might be eligible for admission to the WCCLS and the benefit of receiving financial support via a tax levy. The Aloha Community Library might transform into a public library at that point. Admission criteria for this transformation currently includes (as of 12-12-12) 40,000 annual item checkouts, 40 open hours per week, and certain paid staff in place. The library is currently open 37 hours per week, and admission to the WCCLS cooperative was recommended by the WCCLS Policy Group with the authority to determine efficacy of applicants. In July 2013, the Washington County Commission approved $15,000 in county funds for preliminary design of a new library building. The library moved into a larger space in the same shopping center in April 2014, with the size increasing to . In November 2015, Washington County voters approved a library levy that will bring the Aloha Library into the Washington County Cooperative Library Services in 2016. The library moved into a new larger location in January 2017.

The Reflexive Nature of Awareness: A Tibetan Madhyamaka Defence, pg. xi. Curzon press, 1998. It was initially a theory of cognition held by the Mahasamghika and Sautrantika schools while the Sarvastivada-Vaibhasika school argued against it. The idea was famously defended by the Indian philosopher Dignaga, and is an important doctrinal term in Indian Mahayana thought and Tibetan Buddhism. It is also often translated as self cognition or self apperception.  Sources in the Buddhist schools  According to Zhihua Yao, the theory was first presented by the Mahasamghika school. Their view was preserved in the Sarvastivada compendium of Abhidharma called Maha-Vibhasa and states: > It is the nature (svabhava) of awareness (j√±ana) and so forth to apprehend, > thus awareness can apprehend itself as well as others. This is like a lamp > that can illuminate itself and others owing to its nature of > luminosity.Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge > Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 15. The issue is also discussed in the Theravadin Katthavatthu (section V.9) in a dialogue between a Theravadin and an Andhaka (the Mahasamghikas in the Andhra region).Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 24-25. In the dialogue, the Andhaka is asked by the Theravadin if one knows an awareness of the present by that same awareness. The Andhaka first denies this, but then affirms it when asked again. In the commentary to the Katthavatthu, Buddhaghosa explains this because \\"continuity is concerned\\", thus if seen by itself a mind moment cannot know itself but in a continuous stream of mind moments it can thus be said.Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 26 The Theravadin counters with the argument that the other aggregates like feeling do not feel themselves and uses similes like a knife that cannot cut itself or a needle that does not pierce itself. The Andhaka then recovers by making the following argument for his position of self cognition: > But, when all phenomena are seen as impermanent, is not that awareness also > seen as impermanent?Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition > (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 29. Sarvastivada sources which discuss self-cognition mainly do so in order to refute the idea that a mind moment can know itself in that moment. These include the J√±anaprasthana and Mahavibhasa.Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 42-43 However that does not mean the Sarvastivadins reject all theories of self cognition, they developed their own theory which argued that mind moments know themselves only reflexively in regards to the previous mind moments. As Zhihua Yao states, \\"in other words, the mind knows itself through a reflection of the past mind\\".Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 47 The Sarvastivadins use their metaphysical theory of the real existence of the past, present and future to allow for a present mind to take a past mind as itself. Sautrantika authors also discussed the theory. It was extensively covered by the Harivarman, the author of the Tattvasiddhishastra, and shows that he was in a dialogue with both Sarvastivada and Mahasamghika views.Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 98 Harivarman's view argues against the Mahasamghika's simultaneous model of self-cognition and instead argues that self-cognition is only seen in the course of successive moments of cognition.Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 99 That is, it involves multiple mental processes which Harivarman considers as happening in the \\"present continuum\\" and is not a case of a single mind moment knowing itself but is a case of the mind grasping the \\"image\\" (akara) of itself as it is fading away.Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 107 This is also part of his account of how memory works. The Buddhist philosopher Dignaga also defended a theory of svasamvedana drawing on Sautrantika and Yogacara influences. For Dignaga, svasamvedana is a kind of perception (pratyaksa) which is an \\"internal awareness of mental consciousness\\" and his theory of perception also entails that it is non- conceptual (unlike the other source of valid cognition, anumana - inference).Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 131, 138 Mahayana scholasticism Svasa·πÉvedana is at the root of a major doctrinal disagreement in Indian Mahayana Buddhism. While defended by the Yogacara thinkers such as Dharmakirti and the eclectic Santaraksita, it was attacked by 'Prasangika Madhyamika' thinkers such as Candrakirti and Santideva.Paul Williams. The Reflexive Nature of Awareness: A Tibetan Madhyamaka Defence, pg. xiii. Curzon press, 1998. Since in MƒÅdhyamika thought all dharmas are empty of inherent essence (Svabhava), they argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate reality since that would mean it was self validating and therefore not characterized by emptiness. In Tibetan Buddhism there are various competing views regarding svasa·πÉvedana (Tibetan: Ranggi rig pa). In the Nyingma school's Dzogchen tradition, svasa·πÉvedana is often called 'the very nature of mind' (sems kyi chos nyid) and metaphorically referred to as 'luminosity' (gsal ba) or 'clear light' ('od gsal). A common Tibetan metaphor for this reflexivity is that of a lamp in a dark room which in the act of illuminating objects in the room also illuminates itself. Dzogchen meditative practices aim to bring the mind to direct realization of this luminous nature. In Dzogchen (as well as some Mahamudra traditions) Svasa·πÉvedana is seen as the primordial substratum or ground (gdod ma'i gzhi) of mind. Following Je Tsongkhapa's (1357‚Äì1419) interpretation of the Prasa·πÖgika Madhyamaka view, the Gelug school completely denies both the conventional and the ultimate existence of reflexive awareness. This is one of Tsongkhapa's \\"eight difficult points\\" that distinguish the Prasa·πÖgika view from others.Paul Williams. The Reflexive Nature of Awareness: A Tibetan Madhyamaka Defence, pg. xv. Curzon press, 1998. The Nyingma philosopher Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso (1846‚Äì1912) defended the conventional existence of reflexive awareness as per the Madhyamaka two truths doctrine. According to Mipham, the Prasangika critique of reflexive awareness only applied to its ultimate inherent reality and not its conventional status.Paul Williams.

Sections: 2251, 2252A, 1956, and 2. The charges were based on Shynkarenko's alleged involvement in a conspiracy that included the founding and operating of for-profit hardcore child pornography websites. Shynkarenko was arrested in January 2009 while on vacation in Thailand, and detained for extradition to the United States. Following a three-year battle to avoid extradition, he appeared in U.S. federal court in Newark, NJ on June 11, 2012. Background The indictment of Maksym Shynkarenko is based on his alleged role in a conspiracy involving the founding and operating of several websites that offered still images and videos of child pornography to subscribers. According to the indictment, Shynkarenko and his three co-conspirators operated a two-tiered system of websites, with the first tier consisting of websites displaying samples of child pornography. These websites, named \\"Hualama\\" and \\"Ciampics\\" were used to prompt potential customers to enter their personal and credit card information in exchange for access to the second tier websites. The second tier websites, which included, but were not limited to, \\"Illegal.CP\\", \\"Hottest Childporn Garden\\" and \\"Pedo Heaven\\", consisted of subscription-based websites that, for a monthly fee of $79.99, offered users access to thousands of images and videos depicting the sexual abuse and exploitation of minors that was often graphic, and often perpetrated by adults. Under this two-tiered system, once the credit card information was received by Shynkarenko and his three co-conspirators, they would run a series of internal checks on the credit card to ensure that the customer would not pose a risk to the enterprise. Once the credit card was approved and payment was received, an e-mail was sent to the purchaser containing a username and password that allowed them to access the child pornography materials for a specified period of time. According to the indictment, the proceeds of user subscriptions were then laundered, with Shynkarenko and his three co- conspirators obtaining the processing services of legitimate credit card companies such as \\"Cardservice International\\" and \\"Forcetronix\\" by using fake merchant names to conceal the criminal nature of the enterprise. The funds received through this process were then deposited in a number of bank accounts located in New Jersey, Estonia, Latvia, and Ukraine, among others, to be subsequently wired from those enterprise accounts to the personal bank accounts of Shynkarenko and his three co-conspirators. Investigation The investigation of Maksym Shynkarenko began with the discovery of the website \\"Illegal.CP\\" by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigation (ICE HSI) agents in 2005 during an ongoing investigation of a known pedophile in Long Branch, New Jersey. During a search of this individual's computer, agents recovered e-mails that contained advertisements for the website \\"Illegal.CP\\" that clearly depicted it as a for-profit child pornography enterprise. An undercover ICE HSI agent subsequently purchased a 20-day subscription to \\"Illegal.CP\\" to investigate, and determined that the website contained thousands of images of what appeared to be child pornography, and also made offers to purchase videos provided by users. ICE HSI agents in New Jersey began a three-stage investigation of the website in 2005 consisting of Operations \\"Emissary\\", \\"Emissary Two\\", and \\"Thin ICE\\". The first stage of the investigation, Operation Emissary, uncovered the identities of hundreds of individuals who had subscribed to \\"Illegal.CP\\" between November 2005 and February 2006. The second stage, \\"Emissary Two\\", took place in late 2006 as agents recovered a database containing the identities of hundreds of additional subscribers who had their credit cards processed by the website. Finally, Operation Thin ICE focused on the operators of the website ‚Äì allegedly Shynkarenko and his 3 co-conspirators ‚Äì and recovered evidence on additional individual subscribers. These leads were provided along with master search warrants drafted by the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office to the ICE HSI and U.S. Attorney's Offices throughout the United States for the arrests of those identified as having subscriptions to the website. Ultimately, the investigation of \\"Illegal.CP\\" has resulted in the convictions of 560 individuals in 47 states. Illegal.CP The information on the website \\"Illegal.CP\\" that was uncovered during the investigation by the ICE HSI provides insight into the alleged methods of Shynkarenko and his co- conspirators. According to the ICE HSI, Shynkarenko would advertise to potential customers through e-mails and \\"pop ups\\" that contained banners identifying the site \\"Illegal.CP\\", and more than a dozen images of minors engaging in sexual acts with other minors and adults. The ads contained text used to attract new customers, stating \\"[n]ow you are [sic] few minutes away from the best children porn site on the net!\\" and \\"[i]f you join this site you will get tons of uncensored forbidden pics... forbidden stories, and, of course, many videos.\\", as well as displaying positive comments from a purported current customer of the website, with the words \\"join now\\" included on the top and bottom of the page. Once an individual subscribed, they would receive an e-mail providing a username and password for the website, and information on the website's operating procedure. The e-mail would inform new subscribers that credit charges would appear on the subscriber's credit card statement as the name \\"ADSOFT\\" to avoid detection, and would include a charge of $79.99. Once the \\"Illegal.CP\\" website was accessed, the initial page contained the following statement: \\"Our site is illegal in all countries... Even if you have problems with police you can always say that someone had stolen the information from your credit card and used it. It is very difficult to establish that you were the person to pay for it\\". The subscriber would then have access to thousands of still images and videos of child pornography, and be able to supply their own personal videos to the website for money. Conclusion In June 2012, Shynkarenko was extradited to the US to face charges of distribution of child pornography; he accepted a guilty plea to a single count in January 2014 and was sentenced to 30 years in June 2014. The Associated Press referred to Shynkarenko as \\"most significant distributor of child pornography ever prosecuted in the U.S.\\" References Category:Child pornography Category:United States criminal case law Category:United States District Court for the District of New Jersey cases ","title":"United States v.

History 1890 to 1897 Inabata Katsutaro established a dye store, Inabata Senryoten, in Kyoto in 1890 on his return to Japan from Lyon, France, where he had been sent as a student by the Kyoto Prefectural Government to learn state-of-the-art dyeing techniques, thus marking the beginning of Inabata & Co. In 1893, Inabata Senryoten was renamed Inabata Shoten (Inabata Trading). A year later a branch was set up in Tokyo, and then in 1897, the head office was transferred from Kyoto to Osaka. In the same year, Inabata established Inabata Dye House, using state-of-the-art dyeing technology to enter the dye processing industry. 1916 to 1926 Inabata imported dyes, dyeing technology and dyeing/weaving machines, industrial chemicals, and pharmaceuticals from Europe initiating also instructions in advanced dyeing techniques in Japan. In 1916, the Japanese government set up the Japan Dyestuff Manufacturing Company, which later became the foundation of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.‚Äôs specialty chemicals business. This was aimed at encouraging the domestic production of dyes, as World War I had affected the flow of supplies to the dyeing industry in Japan. Katsutaro Inabata became the president of Japan Dyestuff in 1926. Later, Inabata Shoten expanded its sales network abroad to bring Japan Dyestuff products to overseas markets. Offices were established in Brussels, Mukden, Tianjin, Shanghai, Batavia, Seoul, Quingdao, Hanoi, Dalian, Jinan, and Yogyakarta. 1943 to 1976 Inabata Shoten was incorporated in 1918 to become Inabata & Co., Ltd. The name was changed to Inabata Sangyo in 1943 at a time when business activities were strictly regulated due to World War II. The company's business expanded rapidly after the war, accompanying Japan's rapid economic growth. Inabata & Co., Ltd. was listed in the second section of the Osaka and Tokyo stock exchanges in 1961 and 1962 respectively, and in the first section of both exchanges in August 1973. Inabata Singapore was established in 1976 to become the first post-World War II overseas arm. The company's global network expanded to its current 50 or so overseas locations, dealing in the five areas of IT & electronics, chemicals, plastics, housing & eco materials, and foodstuffs. 1976 to current Inabata Pharmaceuticals becomes a significant provider of pharmaceuticals and API and merges with Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals in 1983.

A succession of temporary buildings were used to house the Customs Official in the following years including the old Sessions House in Church Street (from 1839) and the Miners Arms Inn in Market Square. None were satisfactory. In 1846 Newcastle was declared a free port and a despatch conveying this information stated that local authorities were, 'to take the necessary Measures for promulgating the said order in the usual and most authoritative manner...' In the same year Mr W. A. Scott's property, Newcastle House, was let to the government for use as a Customs House. This property stood on the south-eastern corner of Pacific Street and what later became Scott Street. The supplementary estimates for the year contained an amount, one thousand pounds, for the erection of a purpose built building but it was some years before one was built. Prior to the erection of the current Customs House there was considerable local agitation for a new building, the increase in shipping having placed great demands on the inadequate temporary facilities. During the later 1860s six thousand pounds was placed on the estimates for the purpose of building a new Customs House and tenders were called but nothing came of the move. Immediately prior to the erection and subsequent occupation of the present Customs House, the Customs Department was located on the second floor of Dibb's, Thorne and Company's building situated on the corner of Scott and Bolton Streets. This building has since been demolished and replaced by the South British Insurance Company building. A description from early 1874 of this temporary Customs House highlighted the need for a new building. In January 1871 an announcement in the Maitland Mercury stated that erection of the new Custom House was underway by contractor, Mr Fox. The contract had been taken at 7,000 pounds and the building was to be completed within fifteen months from the time of signing the document. It is obvious, however, that the builder did not meet his obligations. In 1873 new tenders were being called for erection of the Custom House. These were repeated in May 1874. By July 1874 a tender by Messrs Jennings and Pallister had been accepted. By October 1874 the contractors had enclosed the ground preparatory to erection of the new building. The site selected, and eventually built upon, may have been different to that originally selected as Sutherland had intimated in his parliamentary address. However, an anonymous letter to the Public Works Department in 1874 referred to the \\"quicksand bottom\\" of the new site which prevented establishment of a secure foundation. This appears to have been discounted by the authorities and the construction programme commenced as planned. The same letter also makes mention of an allocation of 15,000 pounds for the work but this has not been verified from any other source. The original plans for the building no longer survive, however, these were retraced in 1932. The only outbuildings indicated were the WCs immediately behind the building. By the end of the financial year in 1874 1,100 pounds had been spent in construction, of an estimated total of 13,200 pounds. In October 1876 the last stone was laid in the building and the contractors celebrated by holding a small party on the site, toasting each other and various other officials. The Union Jack and Ensign were hoisted to the top of the building. The near completion of the Custom House was cause for one local newspaper to describe in considerable detail the building. Although celebrations had been held for the final stone laying in 1876 the building was not completed until the following year. In January 1877 it was reported that the English and German ensigns had been raised on the spire of the Custom House. Between March and April 1877 the time ball was placed in position By April 1877, however, many people were wondering why the new building, to all extents finished and habitable, had not been occupied. Finally, in November 1877, the new building opened for business, the barque \\"Jane Spiers\\" being the first vessel cleared from it. At the end of 1877 a further 5,060 pounds, fifteen shillings and seven pence had been spent on constructing the building, 700 pounds, twelve shillings and nine pence on the furniture and 500 pounds on constructing the time ball. Although the Customs House was officially opened in 1877 it may be seen that for a number of years after this, small additions and some fundamental items were made and added to the building. After this a period of what appears to have been a \\"settling in' occurred during which only minor repairs are recorded as having occurred. In June 1878 tenders were let for construction of a dwarf wall around the site. In 1880 the dwarf wall and railing were finally finished at a total expenditure of 874 pounds. During 1884 proposals were put forward for landscaping the grounds of the building although it seems likely that all of these, particularly the planting, did not occur. In 1897 the decision to add an additional wing to the Custom House was made when a Royal Commission investigated management of the Hunter Board and recommended a piece of Crown land in this location be used as the site of the new offices. It was estimated a new building could be built for 4000 pounds. By the end of 1899 the new building was completed. By 1915 the Hunter District Water and Sewerage Board had acquired new offices and vacated the Custom House wing. In 1924 the clock was recommissioned. During 1956 a major refurbishment was carried out. In January 1959 a fire in the roof severely damaged that section and the two floors of the building. The damage was originally estimated at 10,000 pounds but had been re-evaluated by April 1959 at 13,000 pounds. At that time tenders were called for laying new slates. In 1960 the building gained a new tenant when the Department of Works took over a substantial section of the upper floor. As a result, alterations, repairs and a thorough repainting of the area was carried out prior to the department moving in. During 1962 the building again underwent a major refurbishing, mainly repainting. At the beginning of this year the main office, counter and scat backs in the public space, Nautical and Ships Surveyor's office, Superintendent's Office, Engineer and Ship Surveyor's office and Examination Room were all cleaned down and repainted. It was not until 1963 that the roof was retiled with terra-cotta tiles. In 1968 a restoration process was carried out on the external stonework. This was achieved by removing the eroded sand and replacing it with a similarly coloured mixture of sand and a hard setting resin. During 1968 the building was first classified by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). In 1970 a report was prepared on the condition of the previously treated external stonework. It was found to be \\"in a bad way\\". In the same report was the first indictment of the work in the previous years, which had damaged its integrity. This appears to have had little effect because the works scheduled for 1971 included items such as the continued \\"renovation\\" of external stonework using the same compound, renovation of brickwork, replacement of timber gates on Watt Street with cyclone chain wire and replacement of the existing garage doors with aluminium shutters. The growing awareness of the historical value of the building was highlighted in 1976 by celebrations marking its centenary. Customs officials re-enacted the original party held in the building to celebrate the final stone-laying and the media highlighted the building. In the same year a number of enquiries were made regarding historical facets of the building such as its clock. In 1978 repairs included general maintenance as well as repainting the stairwell and staircase of the cast wing, miscellaneous rooms, Long Room and lower ground floor rear entrance lobby. In the same year concerns were expressed about the potential damage caused by blasting for harbour deepening. During 1979 tests were carried out on the earlier stonework and brickwork restoration which was found to \\"have failed in almost all areas of application\\" and at the end of the year there were requests to restore the external brick and stone work. During 1980 the first steps were taken towards establishing a schedule that would be sympathetic towards the historic value of the building. An inspection led to the recommendation that a management plan be prepared. In addition, investigations were to be carried out to determine how to remove the earlier bonding materials on the external masonry. During 1981 work commenced on restoring the external stone and brickwork. The general maintenance works of 1983 included repainting the ground floor of the entrance lobby in an \\"original scheme\\", reinstatement of the original entrance and lobby doors and the clock tower hand rail and new light fittings for the entrance lobbies and hallways to the ground floor. The 1985 repair and maintenance programme recommended replacement of deteriorating terra-cotta tiles with Welsh slates and reinstatement of the iron palisade fence. More money was allocated for interior \\"restoration\\". There was also considerable debate and correspondence over restoring the time ball. The Company of Master Mariners' offered to restore it as a bicentenary project. In December 1989 the Customs House suffered considerable damage during the 1989 Newcastle earthquake. Between 1990 and 1994 remediation works were carried out and substantial conservation works recommended in the 1987 Conservation Plan. The drawings for works to Newcastle Customs House by the Department of Administrative Services for earthquake repair and reinforcement works included: * reconstruction of earthquake damaged chimneys and reinforcement by filling flues with cement; * steel bracing of the first and ground floor ceilings; & * reinforcement of the tower with reinforced cement render The Department of Administrative Services drawings for conservation and reconstruction works documented the following: * internal demolition works including the demolition of many intrusive counters, cupboards and internal partitions; * capping off and disconnecting existing extraneous plumbing and services demolition of part of the later toilet block behind the southern verandah demolition of the outbuildings located on the eastern section of the site; * reconstruction of the eastern verandah, balustrade and stairs including windows in the western wall; * a comprehensive stone repair, epoxy patching and replacement program reinstatement of original profile cornices, skirtings and architraves; * new pendant lighting; * new panelled doors to original details; * revision of telephone, electrical, plumbing and fire services; * new slate roof to the main wings and verandah; * new copper gutters and downpipes; * new paint scheme for exterior building elements; * removal of ' the concrete paving from the stone on the southern verandah removal of some trees from the western side of the main building; * new palisade fencing to existing stone columns and plinth wall; & * new exposed aggregate paving to the site In 1995, substantial alterations were carried out to convert it for use as a licensed cafe and function venue. Customs House, Watt Street, Newcastle, NSW, looking towards the Great Northern Hotel In 2018, the building is known as the Customs House Hotel. The hotel comprises a restaurant and bar on the lower level and a function room on the upper level.  Description  The building is in the Italianate Renaissance Revival Style, characteristic of much of the work of James Barnet. Although the building evolved through two major construction phases the style of the north facing original wing has been faithfully carried through into the rear wing by the later architects under the direction of Government Architect W.L. Vernon. The result is completely harmonious and serves as an example of the right way to add to a building of high architectural distinction. It is generally a two-storey masonry building planned along an elongated cast west axis. The building is terminated by a tower at the western end and by a slightly projecting bay at the eastern end of the front elevation. The building is constructed of dark cream brickwork with a battered sandstone plinth approximately two metres high, sandstone string course and projecting sandstone eaves brackets. The windows to the main street facing facades have carved stone reveals and are surmounted by semi-circular arches of alternating cream and black fire bricks. The windows of the \\"lesser\\" facades, facing into the rear courtyard have simple brick reveals and segmented sandstone arches and stone sills. The western end has a clock tower, lantern and time ball, one of three examples in Australia that are relatively intact. The time ball would fall at 1 PM everyday until World War II in which it was stopped to hide it from the enemy. The building has two floors and a basement area. The building comprises two floor levels and a basement area under the eastern end of the main building. The ground floor area consists of a bar area, dining rooms, kitchen, gaming room and toilets. The first floor consists of conference rooms, bar areas, toilets and function rooms. In the northern wing most of the internal spaces retain elements of the first phase of construction. Cedar window and door joinery survives as well as architraves and skirtings. In the main ground floor rooms and public spaces the plaster ceilings and cornices remain relatively intact and at first floor level these elements generally have been reinstated during more recent restoration works. The ground floor timbers were inspected from the underfloor space and were found to be intact. The upper floor timbers may be assumed to be intact judging from the unchanged state of the plaster ceilings below. Some modification of the upper floor boards would have occurred to enable installation of modern plumbing and electrical services. The stair in the base of the tower is a winding cantilevered stone type with a very fine cedar handrail. The stair in the eastern end of the north wing is timber with plaster soffit, also having a cedar handrail. In the rear wing the joinery and plaster details are different, being characteristic of the style at the turn of the century. The architraves and skirtings from this period are identified as Type 2 and the windows as Types 3 and 4 on the west and south facades and Types 5 and 6 on the east facade. The stair in this section is timber with a cedar handrail exhibiting a high standard of craftsmanship. Many of the ceilings to the rooms of the building have been restored to their original detail in the works undertaken between 1987 and 1999. Most of the rooms have been repainted following a researched colour scheme. It is understood that the colours revealed by paint scrapings were modified to provide this scheme. Evidence of the original colours can be found on a section of the ground floor wall in the eastern stair lobby. Many of the timber veneer and glass partitions dating from the later part of phase Ill described in the 1987 Plan have been removed and the original fabric has been restored. Many of the original panelled doors on the upper floor of the building have been returned or restored. Original/early features of the interior include: * original room layout of the building; * original plaster ceiling roses and intact original cornices; * painted rendered plaster walls and original wall vents; * timber framed floor structure and timber floor boards; * timber skirtings and architraves; * original timber doors and windows; * timber staircases with original stairs, balusters and posts; & * location of fireplaces.McDonald + Associates, 2000 The physical condition of the building was reported as good as at 24 July 2000.  Heritage listing  The Newcastle Customs House is historically, aesthetically, socially and scientifically significant as a public building designed by Colonial Architect James Barnet for the collection of customs duties. It represents a significant landmark in Newcastle with its distinctive Italianate Renaissance Revival design. The Customs House is an important element in the townscape of Newcastle and contributes strongly to the city's special sense of place. The visual relationship to the harbour and the city is significant and symbolises the associational relationship of the Customs House to the maritime and commercial history of Newcastle. The building demonstrates a process and function: the administration of Customs and Excise. Areas in the building such as the Long Room are unique to the operation of Customs authorities (formerly at the upper level from 1877, and later at the south end ground level). The architectural excellence of Barnet's original 1877 building, including external fabric and details, is largely intact. The 1899 wing was added sensitively by adopting almost identical materials and details. Newcastle Customs House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 14 July 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Newcastle Customs House has historic associations with the collection of customs duties in Newcastle in particular, and in New South Wales and Australia generally. When Newcastle was declared a free port in 1846 an amount of money was set aside for a purpose built building to be used as Newcastle's Customs House. The building was officially completed and opened in 1877 and has been continuously occupied since 1877. Areas in the building such as the Long Room are unique to the operation of Customs authorities (formerly at the upper level from 1877, and at present at the south end ground level). The building was designed by the Colonial Architect James Barnet, one of Australia's most distinguished architects. Barnet designed it in the Italianate Renaissance Revival design with strong references to the Venetian Palazzo in the cantilevered bay windows of the north facade. The Italian Renaissance Revival Style is characteristic of much of Bamet's work. Additions to the building were administered by another significant Government Architect, W. L. Vernon. Vernon carried the style of the original north facing wing through to the later rear wing. This results in a completely harmonious extension of the original building. The Newcastle Customs House is historically significant as a landmark which can be seen from across the harbour at Stockton and from vanous points within the city centre. The visual relationship between Customs House and the harbour remains strong despite the effect of the reclamation of land to the north. The time ball and clock are historically significant because they exhibit technical achievements of the late 19th century. The Time Ball has very strong associational value through its important function as an essential device for accurate navigation. It is one of the three examples of this rare type of late nineteenth century technology in Australia remaining almost intact. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Since its original construction, the Customs House building has represented a landmark with its Italianate Renaissance Revival style of architecture, dark cream brickwork and sandstone construction and its distinctive tower topped with the clock, lantern and time ball. Much of the fabric of the original 1877 Barnet building and the early 1899 Vemon wing represents a style of building and some methods of construction which are no longer used. The visual relationship to the harbour and the city is significant and symbolises the associational relationship of the Customs House to the maritime and commercial history of Newcastle. The building is an historic landmark. It is an important element in the townscape and contributes strongly to the city's special sense of place. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The setting and fabric of the Customs House building is held in high esteem by the community of Newcastle. The building is listed on major registers of places of heritage significance at local, state and federal levels. The range and extent of the public's interest in Newcastle Customs House is likely to increase with better public education about the value of historic buildings as repositories of information about past design and construction practices. The buildings and grounds have special cultural, social, aesthetic and educational values by virtue of links with present and past individuals, the community and the potential for research and education. The Customs House has been a prominent feature of the landscape of the Newcastle foreshore for more that 130 years. It provides tangible evidence of a process and function i.e. the administration of Customs and Excise. Areas in the building such as the Long Room are unique to the operation of Customs authorities.

The Customs House has been a prominent feature of the landscape of the Newcastle foreshore for more that 130 years. It provides tangible evidence of a process and function Le the administration of Customs and Excise. Areas in the building such as the Long Room are unique to the operation of Customs authorities. Newcastle Customs House provides a permanent link with the past and is significant to the past and present community's sense of place. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site retains very little above ground to illustrate the phases of development except for the Customs House building and the stone fence posts and reconstructed palisade fence. The archaeological potential of the site is high. There is a strong probability that traces of the convict stockade extend below the surface into the western section of the site. Substantial archaeological evidence relating to the first and later W.C.s as well as other outbuildings is likely to be located in the central car park area. The time ball and clock exhibit technical achievements of the late 19th century. The Time Ball has very strong associational value through its important function as an essential device for accurate navigation. The time ball is one of the three examples of this rare type of late nineteenth century technology in Australia remaining almost intact. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Newcastle Customs House is a rare example of a 19th-century building which has many of the original 1877 features and early 1899 features intact. It is a rare example of a government complex designed by the Colonial Architect, James Barnet and additions administered by the Government Architect W L Vernon.

It is celebrated on the full moon day of the Margashirsha (Agrahayana) month according to the Hindu Calendar (December/January) throughout the country, and in particular in Maharashtra. Legend Dattatreya was the son of the sage Atri and his wife Anasuya. Anasuya, an archetypal chaste and virtuous wife, did severe Tapas (austerities) to beget a son equal in merits as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, the Hindu male trinity (Trimurti). Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati, the goddess trinity (Tridevi) and consorts of the male trinity, became jealous. They deputed their husbands to test her virtuousness. The three gods appeared before Anasuya in the disguise of sanyasis (ascetics) and asked her to give them alms naked. Anasuya was perplexed for a while, but soon regained composure. She uttered a mantra and sprinkled water on the three mendicants, turning them into babies. She then breast fed them with her milk naked, as they wished. When Atri returned to his ashram (hermitage), Anasuya narrated the event, which he already knew through his psychic powers. He hugged the three babies to his heart, transforming them into a single baby with three heads and six arms. As the triad of gods did not return, their wives got worried and rushed to Anasuya. The goddesses begged her forgiveness and requested her to return their husbands. Anasuya accepted their request. The Trimurti then appeared in their true form, before Atri and Anasuya, and blessed them with a son Dattatreya. Though Dattatreya is considered a form of all the three deities, he is especially considered an avatar of Vishnu, while his siblings the moon-god Chandra and the sage Durvasa are regarded forms of Brahma and Shiva respectively.Datta Jayanti Worship On Datta Jayanti, people take bath early in the morning in holy rivers or streams, and observe fast. A puja of Dattatreya is performed with flowers, incense, lamps, and camphor. Devotees meditate on his image and pray to Dattatreya with a vow to follow in his footsteps. They remember Dattatreya's work and read the sacred books Avadhuta Gita and Jivanmukta Gita, which contain the god's discourse. Other sacred texts like the Datta Prabodh (1860) by Kavadi Baba and the Datta Mahatmya by Param Pujya Vasudevananda Saraswati (Tembe Swami Maharaj), both of which are based on Dattatreya's life, as well as the Guru-charita based on the life of Narasimha Saraswati (1378‚àí1458), considered an avatar of Dattatreya, are read by devotees. Bhajans (devotional songs) are also sung on this day. Datta Jayanti is celebrated with much fanfare in the god's temples. The temples dedicated to Dattatreya are located throughout India, the most important places of his worship are in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat like Ganagapur in Karnataka near Gulbarga, Narasimha Wadi in the Kolhapur district, Pithapuram in Andhra Pradesh near Kakinada, Audumbar in Sangli district, Ruibhar in Osmanabad district and Girnar in Saurashtra. Some temples like Manik Prabhu Temple, Manik Nagar host an annual 7-day festival in honour of the deity in this period. In this temple, Datta Jayanti is celebrated for 5 days from Ekadasi to Poornima. People from Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana come here to have darshan of the deity.http://www.manikprabhu.org/ShriDattaJayantihttp://www.manikprabhu.org/ShriPrabhuJayanti The saint Manik Prabhu, who is also regarded as an incarnation of Dattatreya by the people of Datta Sampraday, was born on Datta Jayanti. Datta Jayanti was celebrated by Sadguru Shree Aniruddha Upasana Trust (Mumbai, India) in Amalner city in Jalgaon district of Maharashtra, India between 30 November to 3 December 2017 wherein thousands of devotees from various parts of Maharashtra participated and took blessings of Lord Dattatreya. Shri Ganpati Atharvashirsha, Lalita Ambika Poojan, Datta Bawani, and Shri Datta Sahastranaam were chanted in this four-day event. With the spirit of self- discipline, the foundation managed the event in peace and harmony.http://epaperdivyamarathi.bhaskar.com/chalisgaon/265/05122017/0/3/ Datta Jayanti Celebrations, Alamner References Category:Hindu holy days Category:December observances Category:January observances Category:Hindu festivals in India ","title":"Datta Jayanti"},{"id":"37894792","text":"Weak selection in evolutionary biology is when individuals with different phenotypes possess similar fitness, i.e. one phenotype is weakly preferred over the other. Weak selection, therefore, is an evolutionary theory to explain the maintenance of multiple phenotypes in a stable population. Weak selection can only be used to explain the maintenance of mutations in a Moran process. A Moran process is one in which birth and death are paired events, and therefore population size remains constant. If the population size was increasing, both wild type and mutant phenotypes can proliferate and the weak selection for one phenotype results in no particular selection for either. Hence weak selection requires a finite population to operate. Otherwise there would be no expectation of fixation and hence no selection. The result of weak selection is two phenotypes with similar fixation probabilities. Weak selection works to elongate fixation time for two competing alleles. Consequently, weak selection provides a model for describing how evolution can occur in large steps in a population in which multiple alleles are maintained. There are two basic reasons that two phenotypes could have very similar fitness. One reason could be that the phenotypic differences between wild type and mutant are large but the significance of the mutation is minor. An example could be a change in pigmentation. Another reason could be that the phenotypic differences between wild type and mutant are actually small, such as tail length variation. In either case, the significance of the mutation, which is determined by the environment creating the selective pressure, is low in comparison to other mutations. Hence, almost near neutral mutations result in phenotypes that are weakly selected. Weak selection creates a situation in which the evolutionary dynamics governing the phenotype frequencies in a population are mainly driven by random fluctuations. Hence weak selection increases the impact of stochastic processes on the evolutionary dynamics of the trait being weakly selected. For example, genetic drift could cause a nearly neutral mutation to become the dominant allele in a population by wiping out the wild type. Weak selection is therefore also especially sensitive to the effects of population size. In smaller populations, a weakly selected mutation could proliferate due to stochastic processes such as genetic drift even more easily. Empirically, nonsynonymous substitutions have been reported to proliferate through weak selection in Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis. These non-neutral mutations are thought to have special significance evolutionarily when they affect gene regulatory elements. This is because differential gene expression is critical development and therefore can potentially affect the morphology of an organism. Furthermore, weak selection operates in codon-usage bias resulting in differential levels of gene expression by altering the rate of transcription in mutants with non-preferred codons. Hence, even so called \\"silent\\" mutations can result in slight variations in the fitness of an organism. Additionally, gene duplication offers another way in which an apparently nonfunctional mutation can be maintained through weak selection. Differential expression of duplicate gene copies provides a mechanism through which a protein can evolve new functions.

He also played the flute. *Three dwarves \\"descended from the Dwarves of Moria but were not of Durin's line\\": ** Bifur. Cousin to Bofur and Bombur, he wore a yellow hood and played clarinet.Regarding the relationship of Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur, see ** Bofur. Brother to Bombur and cousin to Bifur, he wore a yellow hood and played clarinet. ** Bombur. Brother to Bofur and cousin to Bifur, whose primary traits were his fatness and his sympathy for Bilbo's plights. He wore a pale green hood. Elves * Elrond, master of Rivendell, the Last Homely House East of the Sea. The Hobbit calls him an elf-friend rather than an elf, one \\"who had both elves and heroes of the North for ancestors.\\" * The Elvenking, king of the Mirkwood Elves. He held the dwarves captive. They were eventually freed by Bilbo. (In The Hobbit he is only called \\"the Elvenking\\"; his name Thranduil is given in The Lord of the Rings.) * Galion, the butler of the Elvenking's halls, whose fondness for wine enables Bilbo and the dwarves to escape. Men * Bard the Bowman, an archer of Lake- town who slew Smaug. Heir of Girion. * Beorn the \\"skin-changer\\", master of the Carrock, able to take the form of a bear. He fought against the goblins at the Battle of Five Armies along with the men, elves and dwarves. Beorn may not have been a man; Gandalf states in The Hobbit that he believes the story calling Beorn \\"... a man descended from the first men who lived before Smaug or the other dragons came into this part of the world\\" rather than the other common story, that \\"he is a bear descended from the great and ancient bears of the mountains that lived there before the giants came\\". In The Lord of the Rings, they refer to his kind as Beornings. * The Master of Lake-town, a grasping politician who met his end starving in the wilderness with the wealth he plundered from his own people after the destruction of Lake-town. He is not named explicitly but had the nickname \\"Moneybags\\". Trolls * Tom, one of the three trolls who captured the members of the Company. The trolls argued over how to prepare their captives for eating, goaded on by the impersonating voice of Gandalf. They argued until dawn, when the sun's rays turned them to stone. (In The Lord of the Rings, the location of this scene is identified as the Trollshaws.) * Bert, one of the three trolls who captured the members of the Company. * William (Bill Huggins), one of the three trolls who captured the members of the Company. Singular characters * Gollum, a creature left largely to mystery in The Hobbit. He lived alone deep under the Misty Mountains on an island in a dark, cold lake. He lost his magic ring, which Bilbo found, and engaged Bilbo in a riddle game in order to stall for time. Ultimately Bilbo escaped with the ring. In The Lord of the Rings it is revealed that Gollum is a degenerate hobbit of great age whose name was originally Sm√©agol. * The Necromancer, a shadowy evil character mentioned in The Hobbit. In The Lord of the Rings, The Necromancer is seen to be Sauron. * Smaug, a great dragon who made the Lonely Mountain his lair. After the Company roused him from his long quiescence, he destroyed Lake-town and was killed by Bard the Bowman. Birds * The Lord of the Eagles, a giant eagle who, with the other eagles, bore the Company away from the burning treetops the goblins had trapped them in, and who aided the allies at the Battle of Five Armies. * Carc, an intelligent raven who lived upon the Ravenhill beneath the Lonely Mountain in the days of King Thr√≥r. * Ro√§c, son of Carc; the leader of the great ravens of the Lonely Mountain. Goblins *The Great Goblin, whose kingdom lies under the Misty Mountains. Warriors of his realm waylay the Company and take them prisoner.

Their particular gift has been to make monastic life possible for women who might not normally be admitted to a monastery due to their state of health or their having a physical disability by all candidates deemed capable of living a monastic life regardless of their physical condition. For this they follow the Rule of St. Benedict with certain adaptations to make this possible. History The Abb√© Maurice Gaucheron (died 29 March 1951) was a priest serving at the famed Basilica of the Sacred Heart in the Montmartre sector of Paris, France, during the 1920s. In the course of his ministry, he came to know a number of women who longed to become nuns but could not find a monastery which would accept them due to their health or physical handicaps. Gaucheron came to see in illness and physical fragility a means of following Jesus and thus a legitimate way of living the contemplative life. He shared this vision with Suzanne Wrotnowska, a Polish immigrant in France, who felt called to share in establishing such a religious community. The two began to seek out other women who either would support this unique way of monastic life or were in need of it. On 11 April 1930, Wrotnowska and several other women dedicated their lives to the future congregation in the course of a Mass in the crypt of the basilica at Montmartre. At that point, Wrotnowska became Mother Marie des Douleurs. In 1933 they were able to open their first monastery, St. Joseph Priory, in the town of Brou-sur-Chantereine, near Paris, which now serves as the motherhouse of the congregation. They were recognized as a religious community by the local bishop, Fr√©d√©ric Lamy, the Bishop of Meaux, in September of that same year. They were formally created a religious institute in 1938 under the name of the Sisters of Jesus Crucified, and Mother Marie des Douleurs was elected the first prioress of the community. By 1936 the community had grown to such an extent that a new monastery was established in Tournai, Belgium. It was closed, however, in 1940 due to the outbreak of World War II After the war, the growth of the congregation was swift, with the members of the congregation reaching 130 by 1951. The congregation had received formal recognition by the Holy See on 22 April 1950. Eventually nine monasteries were founded throughout France. A monastery was founded in the United States in 1955 in Devon, Pennsylvania, followed by another in Newport, Rhode Island in 1962. A monastery was opened in Japan. By 1980, the number of Sisters had reached 210. In 1984 the congregation was admitted into the Benedictine Confederation, an umbrella body of the Benedictine monasteries of men and women around the world. With this step, the congregation was able at last formally to call itself Benedictine. Current As of 2012 the congregation has four monasteries. The number of monasteries in France has been reduced to two: the motherhouse in Brou-sur-Chantereine, and another in Saint-James, a village in Normandy. The two American communities were merged in 2001 into a new monastery in Branford, Connecticut. The monastery in Japan continues.

History Cavite Representative Justiniano Montano of the Liberal Party, who was successfully included in the Liberal's 1949 Senate election ticket, supported Jose T. Cajulis of the Nacionalista Party in the elections to the House of Representatives seat he was retiring from. While the Liberals' candidate easily defeated Cajulis, Montano won in the Senate election; he formed a clique called \\"The Little Senate\\" with like-minded Liberal senators and began to attack President Elpidio Quirino (who was also from the Liberal Party)'s presidency. Montano then created the Blue Ribbon Committee, taking the name from other blue ribbon committees, with the mandate to investigate alleged irregularities from the executive branch. Thereafter, the Blue Ribbon Committee has become the most powerful Congressional committee, investigating alleged criminal misconduct by government officials in aid of legislation. However, the committee cannot incarcerate witnesses and resource persons, except in cases of contempt of Congress. However, the Senate has adopted rules to limit the abuse of this power. These include that all investigations should be \\"in aid of legislation\\", the right against self- incrimination should not be violated, the right to counsel should be respected, rules of procedures should be published and persons concerned should be informed of the rules, and the investigation shall serve a not serve as member's personal aggrandizement.

First issued at some point between 355 and 347 BCE, the coins featured a portrait of the Greek deity Apollo on the obverse, and on the reverse, an illustration of a biga, a Greek chariot drawn by two horses. They had the value of one gold stater each. In the first issuing, Apollo was depicted with long hair, but after that the design was altered permanently to one in which Apollo's hair was shorter. The coins were intended primarily for large purchases outside of Macedonia. As a result, they spread quickly, first to the Balkans and continental Greece, and eventually throughout the Western world of the time; stashes of philippeioi have been uncovered in Italy, Constantinople, Southern Russia, Cyprus, Syria, and Egypt. The vast majority of these were actually struck by Philip's successor, Alexander the Great. The philippeioi issued by Alexander after Philip's death continued to use that name officially, though they were often called \\"alexanders\\" by Alexander's supporters. Influence Considered the most famous coins to be struck by king Philip II, the philippeioi continued to be highly influential even after they were no longer in circulation. Their design was widely mimicked or replicated by currencies outside of Greece, even long after the philippeioi themselves were no longer in circulation. The Gaulish gold staters, whose design closely mimicked that of the philippeioi, continued to be minted up until the end of the Gallic Wars three centuries later (BCE 51). In many cases, the design of the coins changed as it was appropriated by cultures outside of Greece; in some Gaulish imitations, Apollo's hair became large and stylized, while the chariot was often reduced to a single horse (sometimes sporting a humanoid head), with the remaining space occupied by Celtic symbols such as a sun cross, the head of a boar, or a depiction of the sun god Ogmios. The coins were so widespread that in many ancient Roman texts, the word philippeioi is used generically, to refer to any heavy gold coins.

The species is extremely variable in size growth habit and leaf form, with three primary forms recognised. Its occurrence in many places is restricted to coastal regions, watercourses and other locales with more reliable water supplies. It was this association with water that gave rise to the name water bush.  Description  Myoporum montanum grows as a hairless shrub or small tree, up to tall. It is difficult to distinguish from Myoporum acuminatum and the ranges of the two species overlap. George Bentham considered M. montanum to be a variety of Myoporum acuminatum. M. montanum has smaller, narrower leaves, the sepals of M. montanum lack the translucent margins of those of M. acuminatum. The fruit of M. montanum is also pink or light purple compared with the dark purple or blue fruit of M. acuminatum. The leaves of waterbush are variable in shape but are most often thin, linear to elliptic in shape, gradually tapering to the tip with the mid-vein visible on the lower side only. They are usually about long, wide, glabrous, the same colour on both sides and have smooth edges. Sweet scented flowers grow in clusters of one to five from the leaf axils, on stalks long. There are 5 egg-shaped to triangular sepals with slightly papery margins but are only translucent near their base. The flowers feature five, rarely six white or occasionally light pink or purple petals, which may have rows of purple spots. The petals form a tube long, with lobes about the same length. The total diameter of the flower is about . Flowering occurs mostly in winter and summer and is followed by fruits which are smooth or slightly rough drupes. The drupes are ovoid in shape, in diameter, light purple, red purple or brown in colour. Remnants of the flower style point out of the fruit. There are three forms of this species, recognised by Robert Chinnock. They are: * Type form, from the Blue Mountains has narrow, linear leaves and small flowers which are only faintly spotted, if at all; * Desert form, from arid areas of Australia is a large shrub or small tree which has thick, elliptic leaves and flowers prominently spotted purplish red; * Tropical form, from northern Australia, New Guinea, Timor has thin leaves and very small, unspotted white flowers. Myoporum montanum flower Myoporum montanum fruit Taxonomy and naming Myoporum montanum was first formally described by Robert Brown in 1810 and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. The specific epithet is derived from the \\"Latin montanum, pertaining to or growing on mountains\\". Distribution and habitat Waterbush occurs in all mainland states of Australia. It occurs in scattered areas in New Guinea and Irian Jaya and there is one record from Timor. It is very common in eastern Queensland, New South Wales and eastern South Australia. It grows in a wide variety of ecosystem types, from mangrove swamps to rainforest to the Simpson Desert on a wide range of soils. Occurrences throughout the rest of the continent, New Guinea and Timor are largely restricted to coastal regions, watercourses and other locales with more reliable water supplies. Ecology The fruit are a food source for a variety of birds, including emus, and were eaten by Aboriginal people. The food value of the fruits has been rated as low and it is known that some members of the genus contain liver toxins. The flavour is reported as being \\"bitterly aromatic and salty sweet\\". Use in horticulture Waterbush is a hardy plant in cultivation and can tolerate drought. It is a useful screen plant in drier places and is readily propagated from cuttings.

The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. In addition the County serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas. County services are provided to residents by more than 9,000 employees working in 21 different agencies and departments with an annual budget expenditure of $2.4 billion. It is composed of the elected five- member Board of Supervisors, several other elected offices and officers including the Sheriff-Coroner, the District Attorney, Assessor, Auditor- Controller/Clerk-Recorder, and Treasurer-Tax Collector, and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the County Administrator. In addition, several entities of the government of California have jurisdiction conterminous with Alameda County, such as the Alameda County Superior Court. Some chartered municipalities such as the city of Oakland and the city of Berkeley provide their own law enforcement, public safety, libraries, parks and recreation, zoning, and similar services. Other incorporated cities have some or all of these services provided by the County under a contract arrangement. In addition, several entities of the government of California have jurisdiction conterminous with Alameda County, such as the Alameda County Superior Court.  Organization   Board of Supervisors  Under its foundational Charter, the five-member elected Alameda County Board of Supervisors (BOS) is the county legislature. The board operates in a legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial capacity. As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant ratings, must be ratified by the individual city). As an executive body, it can tell the county departments what to do, and how to do it. As a quasi-judicial body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process. The current members, as of January 3, 2011, from the election in and a special appointment in are: * Scott Haggerty‚ÄîDistrict 1 * Richard Valle ‚ÄîDistrict 2 * Wilma Chan‚ÄîDistrict 3 * Nate Miley‚ÄîDistrict 4 * Keith Carson‚ÄîDistrict 5  Elected officers  In addition to the Board of Supervisors, there are several elected officers that form the Government of Alameda County that are required by the California Constitution and California law, and authorized under the Charter. The Alameda County Sheriff-Coroner provides general-service law enforcement to unincorporated areas of the county, serving as the equivalent of the county police for unincorporated areas of the county, as well as incorporated cities within the county who have contracted with the agency for law-enforcement services (known as \\"contract cities\\"). The Alameda County District Attorney prosecutes felony and misdemeanor crimes that occur within the jurisdiction of Alameda County. The District Attorney has been criticized for allowing private debt collectors to use the District Attorney's letterheads for letters demanding payment of debts and threatening jailtime.  Other departments  The County Administrator (CAO) advises, assists, and acts as an agent for the Board of Supervisors in all matters under the Board's jurisdiction. With an annual take-home salary of more than $400,000, the CAO is the highest-paid county administrator in California and makes more than four times the average American administrator. The Social Services Agency (SSA) administers multiple California welfare programs within the county, such as Medi-Cal (Medicaid), CalFresh (food stamps), CalWORKs (TANF), and general assistance. The Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) administers programs such as a Medically Indigent Service Program (MISP) and the Health Program of Alameda County (HealthPAC, a.k.a. the Low Income Health Program/LIHP). Other agencies and departments include the: * Community Development Agency, including the: ** Department of Agriculture / Weights and Measures ** Housing & Community Development Department ** Planning Department * General Services Agency * Public Works Agency * Registar of Voters * Child Support Services * Fire Department * Probation Department * Public Defender * County Library  Law  The Charter of the County of Alameda is the foundational document of the county. The Alameda County Code is the codification of ordinances passed by the Board of Supervisors. The Alameda County Administrative Code establishing the powers and duties of all officers and the procedures and rules of operation of all departments. Every act prohibited or declared unlawful, and every failure to perform an act required, by the ordinances are misdemeanor crimes, unless otherwise specified as infractions.California Government Code ¬ß 25132.  Other governments   California  The Alameda County Superior Court, which covers the entire county, is not a County department but a division of the State's trial court system. Historically, the courthouses were county-owned buildings that were maintained at county expense, which created significant friction since the trial court judges, as officials of the state government, had to lobby the county Board of Supervisors for facility renovations and upgrades. In turn, the state judiciary successfully persuaded the state Legislature to authorize the transfer of all courthouses to the state government in 2008 and 2009 (so that judges would have direct control over their own courthouses). Courthouse security is still provided by the county government under a contract with the state.

History Early life Richards was the eldest son of John Martin Richards (1824 ‚Äì 2 June 1867) and his wife Catherine T. Richards (1823 ‚Äì 15 April 1908), n√©e Reed, Wesleyan Methodists from Cornwall who migrated to Australia in 1842, where she met and married John, who had a position with the Tasmanian government. They had one daughter before moving to South Australia, with some of her relatives, in 1845. This reference has more details of T. J. Richards's family. Tobias was born at Montacute, then the site of a copper mine. John and Catherine went on to have total of 15 children. Richards grew up in Kapunda, and was still living there when his father, a teacher and journalist, drowned in the waters of a local dam while intoxicated. Tobias Richards was a witness at the inquest. In Australian English \\"dam\\" refers to the pond as well as the retaining structure. Career Richards first employment was with Adamson Brothers, a farm machinery manufacturer in Kapunda. He tried other trades, including cordial manufacturing in GawlerEric Richards, 'Richards, Tobias John Martin (1850‚Äì1939)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 11 December 2012 before working as a blacksmith in Unley around 1881. He learned the craft of coachbuilding from Mr. L. Maraun of Hindmarsh Square or Pirie Street, which led in 1885 to his opening a small coachbuilding shop in Pulteney Street, Adelaide. In 1887 he first exhibited a waggonette at the Adelaide Show Richards moved to West Mitcham, near the railway station, some time before 1889. At the 1893 Adelaide Show he exhibited a \\"first-class assortment of vehicles, comprising expresses, waggonettes, and buggies\\". By 1896 he was showing his firm's products at such country shows in Terowie, Mount Barker, Mount Pleasant, Snowtown, Gawler, Kadina, Jamestown, Kapunda. By 1900 he had additional premises on Hindmarsh Square. By 1905 his display at the Autumn Show exhibited some 35 designs, mostly sulkies, including his \\"King of the Road\\" design and despite the prevailing depression had his staff working overtime. He served for many years as a coachbuilding judge at Sydney Royal Shows and was in 1908 elected president of the Coachbuilders' and Wheelwrights' Society and was a prominent member of the Chamber of Manufactures, Australian Natives' Association, Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society, and the Master Carriage and Waggon Builders' Association. He retired from business in 1911 and the firm became TJ Richards & Sons, and added motor body building to their range around the same time. Richards was a keen gardener and player of croquet and lawn bowls. Subsequent Company history From 1911 the Hindmarsh Square premises was advertised as \\"King of the Road Works\\" and \\"Australia's leading coachbuilders\\". In 1914 the firm began selling Dixi, Palmer-Moore and Swift motor vehicles and Rudge and Pope motor-cycles from premises at 95‚Äì99 Pulteney Street. The following year they won the exclusive agency for Studebaker automobiles, while H. C. Richards independently opened an agency in Blyth Street for Oakland cars (he returned to head the company when his father retired). T. J. Richards & Sons was founded in 1916 and opened a new workshop and showroom in an adjoining building at 132 Pirie Street in 1917, but three years later sold the whole complex, which occupied substantial frontages on Hindmarsh Square, Pirie Street and Hyde Street and included two 3-storey buildings and moved to a large new factory covering 14 acres (5.7 ha) on Leader Street Keswick (now Le Cornu's furniture warehouse) and manufacture concentrated on their \\"King of the Road\\" motor bodies, which were built on chassis made by such companies as Dodge and Hudson's Terraplane.

In the same year the company forged a relationship with the Chrysler Corporation and subsequently the production of bodies for Chrysler, Dodge, DeSoto and Plymouth automobiles became its main activity. In 1936 the recently formed Australian company Chrysler Dodge Distributors Limited purchased a financial stake in TJ Richards & Sons, taking a controlling interest the following year. In 1941 TJ Richards & Sons was renamed to Richards Industries Limited and the Richards family sold their remaining interest in the company to Chrysler Dodge Distributors Limited in 1946. The name was changed again, to Chrysler Dodge DeSoto Distributors Limited, and the parent company also changed its name, to Chrysler Dodge Distributors (Holdings) Pty Ltd.Max Gregory, King of the Road, TJ Richards, Coachbuilder, Restored Cars Number 202, Sept‚ÄìOct 2010, pages 10 to 15 In 1951 the American Chrysler Corporation bought 85% of Chrysler Dodge Distributors (Holdings) Pty Ltd and renamed it Chrysler Australia.

December 1957) was an American girl who disappeared on December 3, 1957 from a street corner in her neighborhood in Sycamore, Illinois when she was seven years old. She was last seen by a childhood friend in the company of an unknown man who appeared to be in his early twenties and called himself \\"Johnny\\". Nearly five months later, her remains were found in a wooded area near Woodbine, Illinois, approximately 100 miles from her home. The case, well known in the Chicago area, was widely reported as the oldest cold case murder in the United States to be solved when Jack McCullough, who under his former name John Tessier had been a neighbor of the Ridulph family, was wrongly convicted for her murder in September 2012. However, in March 2016, the DeKalb County State's Attorney announced that a post-conviction review of available evidence showed McCullough could not have been present at the place and time of Maria Ridulph's likely abduction. McCullough was released from prison on April 15, 2016 and the charges against him were dismissed on April 22, 2016. McCullough was declared innocent of the crime by the DeKalb County Circuit Court on April 12, 2017.2017 Circuit Court rulingCNN: Man wrongfully convicted in 1957 cold case murder declared innocent Background Maria Ridulph was born on March 12, 1950, to Michael and Frances Ivy Ridulph in Sycamore, Illinois. She was the youngest of four children and had two sisters and a brother. Although many residents lived or worked on farms in the area, her father Michael worked at one of Sycamore's few factories; her mother Frances was a homemaker. At the time she was abducted, Maria was 7 years old, 44 inches tall, and weighed 53 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes. She was an honor student, then in second grade. She also received awards for perfect Sunday school attendance at Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. John. According to her mother, Maria was high-strung. \\"My daughter was a nervous girl and if she got in any trouble would become hysterical,\\" Frances said in a 1957 interview shortly after Maria disappeared. \\"Someone would probably have to kill her to keep her quiet. I am the only one who could calm her down.\\" Maria was also described as a \\"screamer\\" and afraid of the dark. Her best friend was 8-year-old Kathy Sigman, who lived on the same street as the Ridulphs. Crime On the evening of December 3, 1957, Maria begged to be allowed to go outside as it had started to snow. After finishing dinner, Maria and Kathy Sigman went outside in the dark (as the sun had set) near Maria's house and played a game they called \\"duck the cars\\", running back and forth trying to avoid the headlights of oncoming cars in the street. According to Kathy, they were approached by a man, whom Kathy later described to police as in his early 20s and tall with a slender chin, light hair, a gap in his teeth, and wearing a colorful sweater. The man, who said his name was \\"Johnny\\", told the girls that he was 24 and not married. He asked if they liked dolls and if they liked piggyback rides. He gave Maria a piggyback ride, after which she went back to her house and got a doll to show him. After Maria returned, Kathy ran back to her house to get her mittens, leaving Maria alone with the man. When Kathy returned, Maria and the man were gone. Kathy went to the Ridulph house to tell them she couldn't find Maria. The family initially thought Maria was hiding, and sent Maria's 11-year-old brother to look for her. After he was unable to find her, the Ridulphs called the police, and within an hour, police and armed civilians began a search of the town, but failed to locate Maria or \\"Johnny\\", the man with whom she was last seen. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), presuming that Maria might have been abducted across state lines (a federal crime), arrived in Sycamore within two days to help the local and state police in the search. The FBI and police interviewed numerous witnesses who had seen the two girls playing without any other person present between 6 pm and 6:30 pm, and also spoke to family members who had seen or spoken with Maria and Kathy in the course of Maria getting her doll, Kathy getting her mittens, and Kathy reporting Maria's disappearance to the Ridulphs. Based on these interviews, \\"Johnny\\" was thought to have approached the girls after 6:30 pm, and the FBI concluded that Maria was abducted between 6:45 and 7 pm. John Tessier in high school c. 1955, at the time he lived with his family near the Ridulph home. Kathy Sigman was the only witness who had seen \\"Johnny\\" and was placed in protective custody, as the police and FBI feared that the kidnapper would come back and harm her. The authorities had her look at photos of convicted felons or suspects who bore a resemblance to \\"Johnny\\". John Tessier, who was convicted of the crime over 50 years later, lived in the girls' neighborhood and was on the original list of suspects based on a tip, but the police failed to have Kathy identify him after he provided an alibi for the night of the crime (see Suspect). In late December 1957, Kathy was taken to the Dane County Sheriff's Office in Madison, Wisconsin to see a lineup of possible suspects. She positively identified Thomas Joseph Rivard, described in FBI documents as a 35-year-old man approximately 5 foot 4 inches tall and 156 lbs., with dark blond wavy (bushy) hair. However, Rivard had an alibi, as he was in jail at the time of the kidnapping; police suspected someone else in the lineup as the real culprit and Rivard was merely used to fill out the lineup. Rivard also did not physically resemble Tessier, who was six inches taller and 17 years younger than Rivard.The \\"People's Answer to Defendant's Pro Se Petition\\" filed in People v. McCullough on March 24, 2016 states that Tessier was 12 years younger than Rivard, which appears to be an error as sources support Tessier being age 18 at the time of the lineup. When asked years later about the 1957 lineup, Kathy said she did not remember picking Rivard out of the lineup. Maria's disappearance received national news coverage, and both President Dwight D. Eisenhower and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover took an interest in the case. Law enforcement continued to investigate various suspects in the area, including transients, known sex offenders, and a local man who had given children piggyback rides,Rule 3.8(g) and 3.8(h) Report of the State's Attorney of DeKalb County and Disclosure to the Court and Defendant, People v. McCullough, Gen. No. 11 CF 454 (Ill. Cir. Ct. March 24, 2016). but developed no solid leads. Maria's parents appeared on television and in other media pleading for their daughter's safe return and the public's help in finding her. On April 26, 1958, near Woodbine, Illinois (23 miles east of Galena and approximately 100 miles from Sycamore), two tourists searching for mushrooms in a wooded area along US Route 20 discovered the skeletal remains of a small child, wearing only a shirt, undershirt, and socks, under a partially fallen tree. The decomposed condition of the body indicated it had been there for several months. The body was identified as Maria Ridulph based on dental records, a lock of hair, and the shirts and socks she had been wearing when she disappeared. The rest of Maria's clothing, including her coat, slacks, shoes and an undergarment, was not found. No photographs were taken of the crime scene (although photos were taken of the general location without showing the body) because the coroner, James Furlong, did not want photos of the child's body leaked to newspapers. Because the crime had occurred within Illinois rather than crossing state lines, the FBI withdrew from the case, leaving it to state and local police. The initial autopsy did not determine a cause of death due to the state of decomposition. During an autopsy done 50 years later, a forensic anthropologist determined Maria had likely been stabbed several times in the throat (see Reopening of case). Suspects John Tessier (Jack McCullough) John Tessier was born John Cherry on November 27, 1939 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to British sergeant Samuel Cherry and his wife Eileen McCullough Cherry. Samuel Cherry was killed early in World War II. During the war, Eileen Cherry served as one of the first female airplane spotters with the UK's Royal Air Force and met Ralph Tessier, who was serving with the United States 8th Army-Air Force at RAF Bovingdon, England. She married Ralph Tessier in November 1944, and after the war, she and her son John, then aged 7, followed Ralph to Sycamore, Illinois, where Ralph and Eileen had six more children together over the years. After his mother's marriage, John used the last name Tessier, although he was still sometimes called John Cherry. The Tessier family home in Sycamore was located around the corner from the Ridulph home, less than two blocks away. Ralph Tessier, a sign painter, painted insignia on the doors of Sycamore police cars and was friendly with the police chief. John Tessier was expelled from school in the tenth grade for pushing a teacher and calling her a name. At the time of Maria Ridulph's disappearance, he was 18 years old and living at home with his parents and siblings while making plans to join the U.S. Air Force. The U.S. Post Office at 401 S. Main St. in Rockford, Illinois, where John Tessier (Jack McCullough) said he made a collect call and spoke to military recruiters on the evening of December 3, 1957. On December 4, investigators visited the Tessier home as part of their neighborhood search for Maria. According to Tessier's half-sisters Katherine Tessier (Caulfield) and Jeanne Tessier, their mother told the investigators that John Tessier had been home on the night of December 3, something that they later testified was not true. Shortly thereafter, before Maria's body was found, the FBI investigated Tessier as a possible suspect. Sources differ on whether the investigation was triggered by a tip from a local resident or by John Tessier's own parents seeking to clear their son, who they realized had the same name and general description as \\"Johnny\\". Tessier and his parents told FBI investigators that on December 3, 1957, Tessier was in Rockford, Illinois, approximately 40 miles northwest of Sycamore, to enlist in the Air Force. (This story differed from his mother's previous statement, as reported by her daughters, that Tessier had been home all night.) He said he had been in Chicago on December 2 and 3 undergoing physical examinations required for his enlistment. On the morning of December 3, he had visited the Chicago recruiting station (which was corroborated by records) and then spent the day sightseeing in Chicago before returning to Rockford by train that evening, arriving there at 6:45 pm. Upon his arrival in Rockford, he had called his parents to ask for a ride home to Sycamore, since he had taken the train to and from Chicago and left his own car at home. Telephone records were later found showing that a collect call was placed from the Rockford post office to the Tessier home at 6:57 pm that evening by someone who gave his name as \\"John Tassier\\" as written down by the operator. After making the call, Tessier then met with officers from the Rockford recruiting station to drop off paperwork relating to his enlistment. The officers confirmed that they spoke with Tessier around 7:15 pm that evening, although one officer also expressed some concerns about Tessier's credibility and conduct.Lachman, PT26. Tessier was brought to the police station to take a lie detector test, which he passed. In view of his alibi and the lie detector test result, Tessier was taken off the suspect list, and the FBI closed out his report on December 10, 1957, noting: \\"No further investigation is being conducted regarding the above suspect.\\" Kathy Sigman was never shown a photograph of him or asked to identify him. Tessier left Sycamore the next day to report for basic training at Lackland Air Force Base. Tessier served in the U.S. military for thirteen years and rose to the rank of captain. After leaving the service, he moved to Seattle, Washington, where he subsequently graduated from the King County Law Enforcement Academy in June 1974 and became a police officer in the small town of Lacey near Olympia. He later joined the police department in Milton, Washington where he clashed with the chief of police, who attempted to fire him and documented a long list of complaints about his work and conduct. In 1982, in Tacoma, Washington, Tessier took in a 15-year-old runaway, Michelle Weinman, and her friend, who knew Tessier as a Milton police officer. Weinman later testified that shortly after she began living with Tessier, he fondled her and then performed oral sex on her. Tessier was charged with statutory rape, a felony. After plea negotiations, he eventually pleaded guilty to communication with a minor for immoral purposes, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to one year of formal probation and was terminated from the Milton Police Department on March 10, 1982. On April 27, 1994, John Tessier legally changed his name to Jack Daniel McCullough, saying that he wanted to honor his late mother. By 2011, McCullough, now in his early 70s, was living at a retirement community in northwest Seattle where he worked as a security guard. William Henry Redmond In 1997, Sycamore Police Lieutenant Patrick Solar closed the then-40-year-old Ridulph case, naming William Henry Redmond, a former truck driver and carnival worker from Nebraska who had died in 1992, as the man who had likely abducted and killed Maria Ridulph. Redmond had been charged in 1988 with the 1951 murder of an 8-year- old Pennsylvania girl, although that case was dismissed when a police officer refused to reveal the name of a confidential informant.Lachman, p. PT70. Redmond was also a suspect in the 1951 disappearance of 10-year-old Beverly Potts in Ohio. According to Solar, Redmond told a fellow inmate that he committed a crime similar to the Ridulph abduction and murder. Solar also believed that Redmond's appearance and behavior matched that of \\"Johnny\\". Solar's report was criticized due to lack of supporting evidence and alleged political motivations. Solar himself acknowledged that the evidence against Redmond was circumstantial and that if Redmond had lived, it would have been difficult to convict him in the Ridulph case unless he confessed. For that reason, Solar called the Ridulph case \\"closed, but not solved\\", leaving open the possibility that a better suspect might later be found. When Jack McCullough was later tried in the Ridulph case, the trial judge ruled out any testimony about Redmond on the grounds that he was not a credible suspect. Reopening of the case The case was reopened in 2008 based on new information from McCullough's half-sister Janet Tessier. According to Janet, their mother Eileen Tessier on her deathbed in January 1994 had said, \\"Those two little girls, and the one that disappeared, John did it. John did it, and you have to tell someone.\\" Janet took the statement as meaning that her half- brother John Tessier (soon to rename himself Jack McCullough) had kidnapped and murdered Maria Ridulph; she had also heard from her older sisters (Katherine Tessier (Caulfield) and Jeanne Tessier) that Eileen had lied to investigators that he was home on the night of the crime. Another of McCullough's half-sisters, Mary Pat Tessier (Hunt), was also present when Eileen spoke to Janet, but later testified that she had only heard her mother say, \\"He did it.\\" Nevertheless, Mary Pat testified that she had the same understanding as Janet and that her older sisters had suspected John Tessier of the murder for years. At the time, Eileen, a cancer patient, was on morphine and according to her doctor was \\"disoriented\\". McCullough, who allegedly had once threatened to kill Janet with a gun and sexually molested his half-sister Jeanne when she was a minor, was estranged from the Tessier family by the time of Eileen's death. He was told not to attend her funeral. Janet Tessier said that she made several fruitless attempts over the next fourteen years to get law enforcement, including the Sycamore police and the FBI (who referred her back to the Sycamore police), to look into her mother's statement. Patrick Solar, who during part of this time was a lieutenant with the Sycamore police and had identified William Henry Redmond as the most likely suspect in the Ridulph murder, told CNN that Janet had never spoken to him, but that he would not have suspected John Tessier (Jack McCullough) because he knew the Tessier family, Ralph Tessier had painted the Sycamore police cars, and John Tessier had been cleared by the FBI in 1957. In 2008, Janet e-mailed an Illinois State Police tip line, resulting in the state police cold case unit undertaking a lengthy investigation into McCullough's background and alibi. Janet's sisters Katherine and Jeanne told investigators of their suspicions, and Jeanne said that John had molested her as a child and other young girls. Another woman alleged that John Tessier had given her a piggyback ride as a child and refused to put her down until her father intervened. State police investigators reviewed evidence and developed a new timeline under which Tessier could have kidnapped Maria and driven to Rockford in time to make a telephone call at 6:57 pm and meet with recruiting officers at 7:15 pm. Under this new timeline, they determined that Maria would have been kidnapped no later than 6:20 pm. The police search for Maria was underway by 7 pm according to Katherine, who said she had returned home from a party at 7 pm to find the search in progress. The unused military-issued train ticket from Rockford to Chicago that was not used as evidence against Jack McCullough at his 2012 murder trial. Hoping to have Kathy Chapman (n√©e Sigman) review a photographic lineup, police took five pictures from the 1957 Sycamore High School yearbook, but John Tessier's picture was not in the yearbook as he had been expelled. Police obtained a contemporary photo of him from his former girlfriend, which differed from the yearbook photos in that Tessier was wearing an open collar rather than a suit and the background was dark rather than light. Chapman identified the picture of Tessier. Along with the picture, Tessier's former girlfriend provided an unused, military-issued train ticket from Rockford to Chicago dated December 1957. The investigators took this to suggest that contrary to Tessier's alibi, Tessier had not taken the train on his trip to Chicago and had instead driven his car there, meaning that he could have driven back to Sycamore afternoon on December 3, kidnapped Maria, and driven to Rockford. The police located a high school friend of Tessier's who recalled seeing Tessier's distinctively painted car in Sycamore that afternoon and said that Tessier did not let anyone else drive his car. In July 2011 the Seattle Police Department, which had joined with the Illinois State Police in the investigation, brought McCullough in for questioning (using a professional interrogator due to McCullough's law enforcement experience). At first, McCullough spoke calmly and cooperated, but when faced with questions about the murder of Maria Ridulph and his whereabouts on the night of the crime, he became evasive and aggressive. After McCullough refused to answer any more questions, he was arrested for the kidnapping and murder of Maria Ridulph and extradited to Illinois. Maria's body was exhumed that same month to check for DNA evidence, but none could be found. However, a forensic anthropologist found that Maria had been stabbed in the throat at least three times by a long, sharp blade, pointing out nicks in her sternum and neck vertebrae, consistent with \\"at least three\\" slashes to her throat. Although stabbing was considered a likely cause of death, an appellate court later stated that the findings did not preclude other possible causes of death such as ligature strangulation, which could not be adequately investigated due to the decomposition of soft tissue. News of the arrest in a 54-year-old murder case drew national attention. The lead prosecutor, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell, was reluctant to take the case due to its age and the lack of any physical evidence connecting McCullough to the crime. But, after being persuaded by the Ridulph and Tessier families, who all believed that McCullough was guilty, he formally charged McCullough with the kidnapping and murder of Maria. Court proceedings Trial At the trial in September 2012, the prosecution contended that McCullough was attracted to Maria and decided to kidnap her, but instead ended up killing her, presenting new autopsy reports suggesting Maria was stabbed to death. Although the prosecutors suspected McCullough of molesting Maria, they were unable to prove it and never brought it up in court. Numerous witnesses testified for the prosecution, including Maria's family members, neighbors, law enforcement personnel and Kathy Sigman Chapman, who was the star witness and identified McCullough as \\"Johnny\\", the man who had walked up to her and Maria 50 years earlier. Another childhood friend of Maria's testified that she had also been offered a piggyback ride from \\"Johnny\\" and identified him as McCullough. Three inmates who were jailed with McCullough testified that he talked about killing Maria. However, their stories were both inconsistent and failed to match the evidence indicating Maria had been stabbed. One inmate said McCullough spoke of strangling Maria with a wire, and another said McCullough accidentally smothered her to stop her from screaming. The defense argued that the prosecutors and police were pressured by the Ridulph and Tessier families to solve the case and implicate McCullough, although there was no physical evidence, motive, or indication that McCullough was in the area when Maria was kidnapped. McCullough did not take the stand in his own defense on the advice of his attorneys. On September 14, 2012, McCullough was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of Maria Ridulph and received a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 20 years. He was 73 years old at the time of sentencing. Appeal McCullough appealed his convictions. On February 13, 2015, the Illinois Appellate Court (Second District) upheld his murder conviction, but vacated his convictions for kidnapping and abduction of an infant as being outside the three-year statute of limitations in effect for those crimes in 1957. The decision had no effect on McCullough's life sentence, as the sentencing court had provided that the sentences for kidnapping and abduction would \\"merge\\" into McCullough's life sentence for murder.People v. McCullough, No. December 2, 1364 (Ill. App. Ct. February 11, 2015). Although the appellate court ruled that Eileen Tessier's deathbed statement should not have been admitted as evidence against McCullough, the court declined to overturn the murder conviction because Judge Hallock did not rely heavily upon the statement in issuing the conviction. Post-conviction proceedings overturning conviction In 2015, McCullough, acting pro se, filed a petition for post-conviction relief asking that his murder conviction be set aside. After McCullough's petition was initially dismissed by the court as \\"frivolous and without merit\\", the public defender who had originally represented McCullough at trial ‚Äî and who had continued to investigate the case while staying in touch with McCullough, despite the fact that he was no longer appointed to defend McCullough ‚Äî asked the court to reconsider the dismissal.Motion to Reconsider the Dismissal of Defendant's Post-Conviction Petition, People v. McCullough, Gen. No. 11 CF 454 (Ill. Cir. Ct. October 13, 2015). McCullough filed a successive motion that could not be denied without a hearing from the State Attorney's Office. In response to the motions, DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack, who had replaced Clay Campbell in that position, conducted an extensive review of the evidence, which led Schmack to conclude that McCullough could not have committed the crime and was actually innocent. According to Schmack, evidence was kept out of the trial that clearly established McCullough's whereabouts on the evening of Maria Ridulph's abduction and supported his alibi. In particular, phone records from Illinois Bell showed that McCullough made a collect call to his mother that evening from a payphone in downtown Rockford rather than from Sycamore as alleged at his trial. Given the timing of the telephone call, the approximately 40-mile distance between Sycamore and Rockford, and icy road conditions, Schmack concluded that McCullough could not possibly have been in Sycamore at the time of Maria Ridulph's disappearance.People's Answer to Defendant's Pro Se Petition Under 735 ILCS 5/2-1401, People v. McCullough, Gen. No. 11 CF 454 (Ill. Cir. Ct. March 24, 2016). Following a March 2016 court hearing, on April 15, 2016, Judge William P. Brady of the Illinois Circuit Court vacated McCullough's original conviction and sentence and ordered a new trial. McCullough, who remained charged with the crime, was released on bond that day pending the new trial. A week later, Judge Brady dismissed the charges against McCullough; however, the dismissal of the murder charge was without prejudice, meaning that McCullough could be tried again for the murder of Maria Ridulph should a prosecutor wish to do so. Brady postponed ruling on a request by Maria's brother Charles Ridulph, backed by the signatures of hundreds of Sycamore citizens including the city's mayor, that a special prosecutor be appointed to replace Schmack on McCullough's case. On August 5, 2016, Judge Brady denied the motion for a special prosecutor; Charles Ridulph then stated that he would not appeal the ruling. McCullough was declared actually innocent of the crime by the DeKalb County Circuit Court on April 12, 2017. Freedom of Information Act Requests On July 21, 2016 Porter, son-in-law of McCullough, filed a lawsuit (Case 2016-CH-09536 (Cook County, Illinois)) against the Illinois State Police and Sycamore Police Department for refusal to comply with a Freedom of Information Act request related to the investigation of the case. The FOIA request was prompted by Schmack's allegations of police misconduct on November 3, 2015. Memorials The \\"Maria Ridulph Memorial Map\\", an eight-foot-square map of Sycamore constructed of steel and porcelain, was mounted on the front exterior of the Sycamore Municipal Building in 1958, in commemoration of Maria Ridulph. The map was removed in 2002 and replaced with a bronze memorial plaque that was installed on a pedestal outside the Municipal Building. The Ridulph family also established a \\"Maria Ridulph Memorial Fund\\" that was originally used to pay for the memorial map and was later used as a scholarship, compassion and summer camp fund for local children in need. A portion of the proceeds from Charles Lachman's 2014 book about the case, Footsteps in the Snow, was donated to the fund. In popular culture At the time of McCullough's 2012 trial and conviction, the case was the subject of several news documentaries, including an episode of 48 Hours and a CNN Interactive web feature entitled Taken: The Coldest Case Ever Solved. A true crime book by Charles Lachman, Footsteps in the Snow (2014), also became the basis for a Lifetime Movie Network documentary of the same name. These works, which were published before McCullough's conviction was overturned, presumed that the case had been successfully solved. In contrast, Northern Illinois author Jeffrey Dean Doty self-published a non-fiction book, Piggyback (2014), in which he reviewed evidence and court filings in the case and examined whether McCullough had been wrongfully convicted. As part of his review of McCullough's case, State's Attorney Richard Schmack read Taken, Footsteps in the Snow, and Piggyback, and cited to portions of Taken and Footsteps in his 2016 court filing supporting McCullough's innocence.

At 3,410 or 3,411 m it is, after the Olperer, the second highest peak of the Tux ridge of the Zillertal Alps. With its horn shape and its steep and smooth northwest wall the mountain is imposing from several directions. Location The Schrammacher is 4 km north-northwest of the Pfitscherjoch (on the border of Italy and Austria) and 4 kilometers west of the Schlegeis reservoir at the head of the Zillertal. The Alpeiner Scharte (2,969 m) to the north connects Schrammacher to Fu√üstein and Olperer, while to the west the adjacent summit is the Sagwandspitze (3,224 m), where the ridge turns south and continues to the Hohe Wand (3,289 m) on the Austrian-Italian border. The East flank descends 1600 m into the ‚Äò‚ÄôZamser Grund‚Äù‚Äù valley, while the 900 m high, steep northwest face, made of slabby rock, dominates the head of the Alpeiner and Vals valleys to the west. Three glaciers remain on the mountain: the Alpeiner Ferner at the bottom of the northwest wall, the Oberschrammacher Ferner on the southeast slope, and the large Stampflkees to the southwest. Schrammacher over the Stampflkees. The normal rout goes over the south ridge on the right First ascent The first ascent took place on August 19, 1847, when the meteorologist, theology professor and mountaineer Peter Karl Thurwieser from Salzburg and the local guides Georg Lechner (\\"Schneider-J√∂rgl\\") and Jakob Huber (\\"Gainer-Jakl\\") from Mayrhofen reached the summit from an alp just north of the Pfitscherjoch over the south ridge.Anton Farbmacher, Ersteigung der Schramaspitze, Mittheilungen des Deutschen und Oesterreichischen Alpenvereins, 1901, volume 27, pp. 59-60. (Originally published in Boten von und f√ºr Tirol und Vorarlberg, 1847, p. 288-292.) Though an account was published in 1847, this ascent was apparently forgotten by the mountaineering society and in 1875 the journal of the German and Austrian Alpine Club reported a first ascent the previous year by the Hungarian scientist and mountaineer Maurice of Dechy of Pest and the Sulden mountain guide Hans Pinggera.Mittheilungen des Deutschen und Oesterreichischen Alpenvereins, Volume ?, Munich 1875, p. 29 This oversight was only rectified in 1901 in the same journal, and the 1874 ascent is still often quoted as the first. The Schrammacher northwest face as captured from the L√§mpermahdspitze (2,595 m), 22 km away in the Stubai Alps The first ascent of the northwest face by Fritz Drasch and Johannes Lechner on 25 September 1895 was well ahead of its time, foreshadowing the interest in climbing great north faces starting in the 1920s.Friedl Pfeifer, Durch die Nordwand des Schrammacher In 1951, Hermann Buhl led the first winter ascent of this wall.Reinhold Messner and Horst H√∂fler Hermann Buhl: Climbing Without Compromise, The Mountaineers, Seattle, 2000, page 235 Bases and routes The normal route, and the route of both the 1847 and 1874 ascents, leads from the Pfitscherjoch hut (Pfitscherjochhaus) at 2,248 meters north-northeast across the western edge of the Stampflkees (glacier). The route continues on the south ridge to the summit in moderately difficult climbing (UIAA I-II) in a good 5 hours. Other bases from which Schrammacher is climbed are the Olpererh√ºtte (2,389 m, west above the Schlegeis reservoir) and the Gera hut (2,324 m) at the end of Valser valley. The routes from here take over 6 hours and there is an increased risk of rock falls below the Schrammacher walls.

The cathedral grew out of a parochial school which opened in 1951 and a parish erected in 1959. Construction on the cathedral began in 1982, and was completed in 1985. It was dedicated in 1988, the thousand-year anniversary of the arrival of Christianity in Ukraine. The cathedral is the seat for the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Saint Josaphat in Parma, which was erected in 1983 during construction of the building. Site: School and chapel School growth 1953 school building In 1947, Saints Peter and Paul Ukrainian Catholic Church in Cleveland, Ohio, purchased of land in then-sparsely populated Parma, Ohio. The $32,000 ($ in dollars) school was dedicated on May 31, 1951, and opened the following November 15. The school was staffed by the Sisters of the Order of St. Basil the Great. The school contained a chapel, named for St. Josaphat. which served as a mission church to Ukrainian Catholic families in the area. The chapel was renovated in 1959, at which time the name of the school was changed to St. Josaphat School. A second, $100,000 ($ in dollars) school building on the site was completed in 1953 and blessed on May 9, 1954. A convent building for the Sisters of St. Basil was blessed on the site on May 9, 1954, as well. A five-classroom addition to the St. Josaphat School was built in 1965. Construction of the \\"Astrodome\\" \\"Astrodome\\" In the summer of 1961, St. Josaphat Parish began construction of a high school on its property. Parishioner Nicholas Baiko, an engineer with the Arthur G. McKee & Co. industrial engineering firm, did the preliminary drawings. Parishioner Michael Stefanyk, an architect and engineer, completed the plans. The dome of the school was designed by Roof Structures, Inc. of St. Louis, Missouri, while the architectural firm of T.A. Badowski & Associates consulted. Designed for 500 students, the structure was circular and features 16 one-story classrooms clustered around a central dome. The classroom ring contained administrative offices, classrooms, a library, and laboratories. The central dome was a combination auditorium, gymnasium, and theatre. The wall supporting the dome was high, and the dome rose another above the wall. The dome itself was in diameter, while the classroom ring was in diameter. The foundation consisted of reinforced concrete footers standing on bedrock. The structure had an extensive basement. Initially designed to act as a fallout shelter capable of serving 2,000 people, it was redesigned so that half the space was occupied by Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning machinery while the other half contained seven classrooms and a cafeteria. The outer wall of the classroom ring was built of brick with stone trim, while the higher inner wall was concrete block and glass brick. A hallway around the inner wall gave students access to all classrooms and the dome. Roughly halfway up the inner wall, a balcony projected into the dome. A ring of poured reinforced concrete lay atop the balcony, anchoring it to this wall. Another ring of poured reinforced concrete lay atop the wall. The base of the dome itself was made of steel plate. Each plate was high and thick, and they were both bolted and welded where they joined one another. The dome was supported by wooden ribs, each in size. Manufactured in Oregon, they were curved on the top to match the arc of the dome. Thirty-two ribs were jointed with steel angle plates to the dome rim. Halfway to the dome apex, the 32 ribs were spliced into one another (again using steel angle plates) to create 16 ribs. These 16 ribs were bolted to a steel ring at the apex of the dome. Secondary wooden beams were used between the ribs to enhance the dome's stability. Tongue and groove planks, each thick, were spiked to the ribs from the outside. These in turn were covered with thick composite insulation board. Liquid hot asphalt was mopped onto the insulation board, building up the roof. A layer of white marble chips was impregnated into the asphalt to complete the roof. The auditorium and balcony could accommodate 1,500 people. The structure was estimated to cost $1 million ($ in dollars), with another $700,000 ($ in dollars) in labor donated free from parishioners. When construction began in May 1961, parish officials believed the high school would be complete in September 1962. Construction delays were numerous, however, and by June 1964 officials thought that five classrooms might open in September 1965. The building was finally completed in early 1969, and blessed by Archbishop Ambrose Senyshyn of the Archeparchy of Philadelphia on April 20, 1969. For various reasons, the school never opened. It was repurposed into an event center, public auditorium, public theatre, and sports venue. It was first known as St. Josaphat Auditorium, but by 1975 had been nicknamed the \\"St. Josaphat Astrodome\\" for its resemblance to the Houston Astrodome. Congregation and chapel Rectory Archbishop Constantine Bohachevsky erected St. Josaphat Parish in August 1959, appointing Rev. Andrew Ulicky (an assistant pastor at SS. Peter and Paul Church) as the pastor. Brookpark Road was named the dividing line between the mother parish and the new St. Josaphat, whose boundary extended south to Medina, Ohio. The erection of the new parish came about due to the significant growth among Ukrainian Catholics in the area (now numbering some 450 families). St. Josaphat Chapel was redecorated after the elevation to parish status. Artist Theodore Katomay of Chicago created 24 murals for the renovation, 17 of which were placed in the sanctuary. The new murals were in place in time for the Christmas celebration on January 7, 1961, and blessed on January 22 by Monsignor Dmytro Gresko of SS. Peter and Paul and Rev. Ulicky. A fire broke out in St. Josaphat Chapel during the evening mass on April 11, 1973. It began in the sacristy, and 40 worshippers fled the blaze. The fire did $100,000 ($ in dollars) in damage, destroying the sacristy and main altar and scorching some pews. Cathedral Construction Rev. Ulicky originally sought to build a church immediately after erection of the parish. Church leaders, however, believed construction of the high school should come first. In 1973, Father Ulicky was appointed pastor at St. Mary Byzantine Catholic Church in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. His successor, the Very Reverend Yaroslaw Sirko, continued to plan for construction of a church, but died in October 1979 after a two-year battle with cancer. The Right Reverend Michael Fedorowich, assigned to St. Josaphat in December 1979, began the process of organizing committees to plan the new church. The structure was designed by the firm of McWilliams Martyniuk Schidlowski of Kent, Ohio, and built under the auspices of general contractor Chopko Construction. The 500-seat building incorporated traditional features such as onion domes on the roof and an altar set in the east wall. It also included contemporary and \\"futuristic\\" architectural details in order to reflect the then-upcoming thousand-year anniversary of Christianity's introduction in Ukraine. Ground for the cathedral was broken on June 24, 1982. The initial cost was estimated at $2.3 million ($ in dollars). Topping out of the church occurred on August 30, 1983, when the main aluminum onion dome was set atop the church. During construction, the Eparchy of Saint Josaphat was erected in December 1983. Robert Mikhail Moskal was installed as the first eparch (bishop) of the diocese at the unfinished cathedral on February 29, 1984. A ceremonial cornerstone was laid and blessed on November 11, 1984, which happened to be the 25th anniversary of the congregation's establishment as well. St. Josaphat Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral held its first services on June 24, 1985. Eparch Robert Moskal led a procession from the chapel to the cathedral carrying the Blessed Sacrament and relics of St. Josaphat, then celebrated a pontifical divine liturgy at the new church. The cathedral was blessed once. The consecration of St. Josaphat Cathedral was delayed until May 1, 1988, the year in which Ukrainians observed the thousand-year anniversary of Christianity in Ukraine. This also allowed for completion of all iconostasis and other interior decorations. Cardinal Myroslav Ivan Lubachivsky, head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church worldwide, led the April 29 rites consecrating the main altar, assisted by Archbishop Maxim Hermaniuk of the Archeparchy of Winnipeg, Archbishop Stephen Sulyk of the Archeparchy of Philadelphia, Exarch Michel Hrynchyshyn of the Apostolic Exarchate of France, Benelux and Switzerland, Eparch Andrew Pataki of the Ruthenian Catholic Eparchy of Parma, and others. Consecration of the walls occurred on May 1. A procession led by Cardinal Lubachivsky, Archbishop and Papal Pro-Nuncio Pio Laghi, Bishop Anthony Pilla of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland, Bishop James William Malone of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Youngstown, and Bishop Emeritus William Michael Cosgrove of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Belleville circled the building before entering. Cardinal Lubachivsky anointed the wall behind the main altar with holy chrism, Archbishop Laghi the north wall, and Archbishops Hermaniuk and Sulyk the south and west walls. The walls were sprinkled with holy water, concluding the consecration rite. A Pontifical High Mass followed. Cathedral history The cathedral is the seat of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Saint Josaphat. St. Josaphat's aluminum domes gradually faded to a celadon color due to weathering. They were painted gold in the 1990s. A shrine to Our Lady of Pochaiv was dedicated on the cathedral grounds on May 23, 2010. The shrine was the result of a seven-year design and fundraising effort by the St. Josaphat Apostleship of Prayer, a group of women congregants. The shrine was designed by a Cleveland firm, Kulchytsky Architects. The brick shrine holds a mosaic in the likeness of the painted Ukrainian icon, which was designed by Eikona Studios of Cleveland and created in Italy. The shrine was blessed by Bishop John Bura, then apostolic administrator of the Eparchy of St. Josaphat. The domes atop the cathedral were replaced in 2015. Parishioners of St. Josaphat began raising funds about 2010 to replace the cathedral's five domes, which had deteriorated over time. Architect Christ J. Kamages was hired to design the replacements, and Unique Services & Applications installed them. The new domes are made of stainless steel and covered with titanium nitride, a ceramic material with a brilliant gold sheen. Construction of the domes began in the spring of 2015, and were blessed by Eparch Bohdan Danylo on October 5. Installation was completed in November. The $550,000 ($ in dollars) domes are expected to last from 50 to 200 years.

He played college football for the University of Michigan from 1968 to 1970. He also briefly played professional football for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League. During the 1970s, he worked as an administrator in the University of Michigan athletic department. He later pursued a career in business and was in charge of minority recruitment at Domino's Pizza for many years. Michigan A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Betts played high school football at Benedictine High School in Cleveland. He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1967 and played college football there from 1968 to 1970. He played at several positions during his collegiate career, including quarterback, running back, wide receiver and safety. As a sophomore in 1968, Betts played at the running back and wide receiver positions. When Bo Schembechler became the team's head football coach in 1969, protests by African American players were disrupting the Indiana Hoosiers football team. An organization known as the Black Action Movement (BAM) was also spreading in Ann Arbor. Amid the threat of deteriorating race relations, Betts saw an opportunity to alter Schembechler's clean-shave policy. Betts told the coach that facial hair was part of the African American players' \\"heritage.\\" Schembechler agreed to relax the policy, reportedly \\"to the amusement of the rest of the players, both black and white, who believed Betts was full of shit.\\" As the backup quarterback for the 1969 Michigan Wolverines football team, he totaled 293 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, 130 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns.(To retrieve Marsh's statistics, enter \\"betts\\" in the space for \\"Enter last name\\" and \\"jim\\" in the space for \\"Enter first name.\\") His best game as a quarterback came against Illinois on November 8, 1969, when he completed six of nine passes for 106 yards, including touchdown passes to Garvie Craw and John Gable. He also rushed for 51 yards and a touchdown on nine carries. Michigan defeated Illinois by a score of 57-0, marking the second worst defeat in the history of the Illinois football program. Betts also played in the 1969 Michigan vs. Ohio State football game, considered one of the biggest upsets in college football history. The unranked Wolverines defeated the No. 1 Buckeyes by a 24-12 score. The day before the game, a fight broke out between players from the two teams as they passed each other in the tunnel at Michigan Stadium. Schembechler and Woody Hayes separated the players. Forty years later, Betts recalled: \\"On Friday, the Buckeyes were on the field first, doing their walk-through drills. Before they left, they lined up in the tunnel on both sides. As we made our way to the field, some Buckeye made a nasty comment and all hell broke loose. Woody and Bo were trying to separate guys as we were all fighting like cats and dogs. One of us yelled that we'd beat 'em tomorrow. And we did!\\". As a senior, Betts told Schembechler he was unhappy in the backup role and persuaded the coach to allow him to move to the defensive unit for the 1970 Michigan Wolverines football team. During spring practice, he made the switch to the safety position and received the Meyer Morton Trophy, awarded each year to the Michigan football player who showed \\"the greatest development and most promise as a result of the annual spring practice.\\" In his final game in a Michigan uniform, Betts had 14 tackles and intercepted a pass to set up a Michigan score in the 1970 Michigan-Ohio State game. After the 1970 football season, Betts was selected to play on defense for the Blue team in the annual Blue-Gray All-Star Game in Birmingham, Alabama. Professional football Betts was drafted by the New York Jets in the 10th round (240th overall pick) of the 1971 NFL Draft. In May 1971, he signed a contract to play for the Jets as a backup quarterback and safety. However, an eye injury cast uncertainty over his potential career as a professional football player. He lost 70% of the vision in his left eye in a swimming accident when a whistle struck him in the eye. He was cut by the Jets in training camp, tried out with the Minnesota Vikings, but was cut by them as well. He did play professional football for a short time with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League. Later years After his playing career ended, Betts worked for Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company for two years. In August 1974, he was hired by the University of Michigan to direct the academic counseling and tutoring service for the university's student-athletes. In that capacity, he became an advocate for football players to complete their degrees. In 1978, Betts moved to Chicago where he accepted a position with a financial services firm. He subsequently returned to Ann Arbor where he worked for an advertising firm founded by a former Michigan football player, Don Coleman. In the late 1980s, Betts was hired by Domino's Pizza as its Director of Minority Recruitment, a position he held for at least 15 years. He also served as the company's Director of Urban Initiatives. Betts is married to Marty Betts. They have two sons, Eric and Evan.

Its main advantage is that it can be used to write straightforward code that automatically takes full advantage of all the processing power available, without programmers needing to be concerned with identifying parallelisms, specifying vectorization, avoiding race conditions, and other challenges of manual directive-based programming approaches such as OpenMP. Programs written in SequenceL can be compiled to multithreaded code that runs in parallel, with no explicit indications from a programmer of how or what to parallelize. , versions of the SequenceL compiler generate parallel code in C++ and OpenCL, which allows it to work with most popular programming languages, including C, C++, C#, Fortran, Java, and Python. A platform- specific runtime manages the threads safely, automatically providing parallel performance according to the number of cores available, currently supporting x86, POWER8, and ARM platforms. History SequenceL was initially developed over a 20-year period starting in 1989, mostly at Texas Tech University. Primary funding was from NASA, which originally wanted to develop a specification language which was \\"self-verifying\\"; that is, once written, the requirements could be executed, and the results verified against the desired outcome. The principal researcher on the project was initially Dr. Daniel Cooke, who was soon joined by Dr. Nelson Rushton (another Texas Tech professor) and later Dr. Brad Nemanich (then a PhD student under Cooke). The goal of creating a language that was simple enough to be readable, but unambiguous enough to be executable, drove the inventors to settle on a functional, declarative language approach, where a programmer describes desired results, rather than the means to achieve them. The language is then free to solve the problem in the most efficient manner that it can find. As the language evolved, the researchers developed new computational approaches, including consume-simplify-produce (CSP). In 1998, research began to apply SequenceL to parallel computing. This culminated in 2004 when it took its more complete form with the addition of the normalize-transpose (NT) semantic, which coincided with the major vendors of central processing units (CPUs) making a major shift to multi-core processors rather than continuing to increase clock speeds. NT is the semantic work-horse, being used to simplify and decompose structures, based on a dataflow-like execution strategy similar to GAMMA and NESL. The NT semantic achieves a goal similar to that of the L√§mmel and Peyton-Jones‚Äô boilerplate elimination. All other features of the language are definable from these two laws - including recursion, subscripting structures, function references, and evaluation of function bodies. Though it was not the original intent, these new approaches allowed the language to parallelize a large fraction of the operations it performed, transparently to the programmer. In 2006, a prototype auto-parallelizing compiler was developed at Texas Tech University. In 2009, Texas Tech licensed the intellectual property to Texas Multicore Technologies (TMT),Texas Multicore Technologies, Inc. for follow-on commercial development. In January 2017 TMT released v3, which includes a free Community Edition for download in addition to the commercial Professional Edition. Design SequenceL is designed to be as simple as possible to learn and use, focusing on algorithmic code where it adds value, e.g., the inventors chose not to reinvent I/O since C handled that well. As a result, the full language reference for SequenceL is only 40 pages, with copious examples, and its formal grammar has around 15 production rules. SequenceL is strictly evaluated (like Lisp), statically typed with type inference (like Haskell), and uses a combination of infix and prefix operators that resemble standard, informal mathematical notation (like C, Pascal, Python, etc.). It is a purely declarative language, meaning that a programmer defines functions, in the mathematical sense, without giving instructions for their implementation. For example, the mathematical definition of matrix multiplication is as follows: :The product of the m√óp matrix A with the p√ón matrix B is the m√ón matrix whose (i,j)'th entry is ::\\\\sum_{k=1}^p A(i,k)B(k,j) The SequenceL definition mirrors that definition more or less exactly: matmul(A(2), B(2)) [i,j] := let k := 1...size(B); in sum( A[i,k] * B[k,j] ); The subscripts following each parameter A and B on the left hand side of the definition indicate that A and B are depth-2 structures (i.e., lists of lists of scalars), which are here thought of as matrices. From this formal definition, SequenceL infers the dimensions of the defined product from the formula for its (i, j)'th entry (as the set of pairs (i, j) for which the right hand side is defined) and computes each entry by the same formula as in the informal definition above. Notice there are no explicit instructions for iteration in this definition, or for the order in which operations are to be carried out. Because of this, the SequenceL compiler can perform operations in any order (including parallel order) which satisfies the defining equation. In this example, computation of coordinates in the product will be parallelized in a way that, for large matrices, scales linearly with the number of processors. As noted above, SequenceL has no built-in constructs for input/output (I/O) since it was designed to work in an additive manner with other programming languages. The decision to compile to multithreaded C++ and support the 20+ Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG) languages (C, C++, C#, Java, Python, etc.) means it easily fits into extant design flows, training, and tools. It can be used to enhance extant applications, create multicore libraries, and even create standalone applications by linking the resulting code with other code which performs I/O tasks. SequenceL functions can also be queried from an interpreter with given inputs, like Python and other interpreted languages. Normalize‚Äìtranspose The main non- scalar construct of SequenceL is the sequence, which is essentially a list. Sequences may be nested to any level. To avoid the routine use of recursion common in many purely functional languages, SequenceL uses a technique termed normalize‚Äìtranspose (NT), in which scalar operations are automatically distributed over elements of a sequence. For example, in SequenceL we have :[1,2,3] + 10  [11,12,13] This results not from overloading the '+' operator, but from the effect of NT that extends to all operations, both built-in and user-defined. As another example, if f() is a 3-argument function whose arguments are scalars, then for any appropriate x and z we will have :f(x,[1,2,3],z)  [f(x,1,z), f(x,2,z), f(x,3,z)] The NT construct can be used for multiple arguments at once, as in, for example :[1,2,3] + [10,20,30]  [11,22,33] It also works when the expected argument is a non-scalar of any type T, and the actual argument is a list of objects of type T (or, in greater generality, any data structure whose coordinates are of type T). For example, if A is a matrix and Xs is a list of matrices [X1, ..., Xn], and given the above definition of matrix multiply, in SequenceL we would have matmul(A,Xs) = [matmul(A,X1),...,matmul(A,Xn)] As a rule, NTs eliminate the need for iteration, recursion, or high level functional operators to #do the same things to every member of a data structure, or to #process corresponding parts of similarly shaped structures together. This tends to account for most uses of iteration and recursion. Example: prime numbers A good example that demonstrates the above concepts would be in finding prime numbers. A prime number is defined as :An integer greater than 1, with no positive divisors other than itself and 1. So a positive integer z is prime if no numbers from 2 through z-1, inclusive, divide evenly. SequenceL allows this problem to be programmed by literally transcribing the above definition into the language. In SequenceL, a sequence of the numbers from 2 through z-1, inclusive, is just (2...(z-1)), so a program to find all of the primes between 100 and 200 can be written: prime(z) := z when none(z mod (2...(z-1)) = 0); Which, in English just says, :...return the argument if none of the numbers between 2, and 1 less than the argument itself, divide evenly into it. If that condition isn‚Äôt met, the function returns nothing. As a result, running this program yields cmd:>prime(17) 17 cmd:>prime(18) empty The string \\"between 100 and 200\\" doesn‚Äôt appear in the program. Rather, a programmer will typically pass that part in as the argument. Since the program expects a scalar as an argument, passing it a sequence of numbers instead will cause SequenceL to perform the operation on each member of the sequence automatically. Since the function returns empty for failing values, the result will be the input sequence, but filtered to return only those numbers that satisfy the criteria for primes: cmd:>prime(100...200) [101,103,107,109,113,127,131,137,139,149,151,157,163,167,173,179,181,191,193,197,199] In addition to solving this problem with a very short and readable program, SequenceL‚Äôs evaluation of the nested sequences would all be performed in parallel. Components The following software components are available and supported by TMT for use in writing SequenceL code. All components are available on x86 platforms running Windows, macOS, and most varieties of Linux (including CentOS, RedHat, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu), and on ARM and IBM POWER platforms running most varieties of Linux. Interpreter A command-line interpreter allows writing code directly into a command shell, or loading code from prewritten text files. This code can be executed, and the results evaluated, to assist in checking code correctness, or finding a quick answer. It is also available via the popular Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE). Code executed in the interpreter does not run in parallel; it executes in one thread. Compiler A command-line compiler reads SequenceL code and generates highly parallelized, vectorized, C++, and optionally OpenCL, which must be linked with the SequenceL runtime library to execute. Runtime The runtime environment is a pre-compiled set of libraries which works with the compiled parallelized C++ code to execute optimally on the target platform. It builds on Intel Threaded Building Blocks (TBB)Intel Threaded Building Blocks (TBB) and handles things such as cache optimization, memory management, work queues-stealing, and performance monitoring. Eclipse IDE plug-in with debugger An Eclipse integrated development environment plug-in provides standard editing abilities (function rollup, chromacoding, etc.), and a SequenceL debugging environment. This plug- in runs against the SequenceL Interpreter, so cannot be used to debug the multithreaded code; however, by providing automatic parallelization, debugging of parallel SequenceL code is really verifying correctness of sequential SequenceL code. That is, if it runs correctly sequentially, it should run correctly in parallel ‚Äì so debugging in the interpreter is sufficient.

It marked the debut of the director as well as the leads. The film was produced by Bhushan Kumar and Krishan Kumar under the banner of T-Series Super Cassettes Industries. Yaariyan tells the story of 5 close friends who are in college, experiencing different relationships and learning new values. The response to the promotional material on YouTube led the distributor to release the film two weeks earlier than initially planned. The film released on 10 January 2014 with 1200 screens release in India. The film received negative review from critics but was a box office success grossing ‚Çπ695.5 million against its ‚Çπ100 million budget. Plot Living in a university campus set in Sikkim, Lakshya (Himansh Kohli) is the son of a martyred army officer but does not appreciate his father's sacrifice for the nation. Lakshya, Jiya (Nicole Faria) ‚Äì a college bombshell, Saloni (Rakul Preet Singh) ‚Äì a geek, Pardy ‚Äì a drummer, and Neil ‚Äì a biker, are five close friends who are exploring the best moments of their lives in college, experiencing different relationships yet living an aimless life. Lakshya and his girlfriend, Jenny try to kiss in the library but get interrupted by Pardy and caught by the principal. Soon, in a function Lakshya and Jenny again try to use some personal time with Jiya taking her role for the function but things go awry when Jiya gets stripped from her saree in her underwear in front of the audience and Lakshya and Jenny hanging from a chain above. Jenny then dumps Lakshya. They come across a challenge when their college land has been bought by an Australian businessman who plans to build a casino instead but is ready to lease out the land to the college for 100 years only if they're able to defeat a team of Australian students in a five-round competition. The principal chooses the five students to take part in the challenge. For the first three rounds they are sent to Australia where Lakshya meets his best friend and cousin Debu. During the first round of rock concert, the Australian band steals Lakshya and his band's song, and on protest they brutally beat Debu. While Debu is rushed to hospital, Lakshya and the band perform a Hindi song, eventually losing the first round. Saloni then wins the second round which is a chess competition. Unable to recover from his injuries, Debu succumbs to death in the hospital. Disturbed by his death, Saloni and Neil lose the third round of bike race, giving Australia a 2‚Äì1 lead. The competition is then shifted to India with two more rounds to go. Lakshya discovers that Neil was the traitor who gave their song to the Australian band and intentionally lost the bike race motivated by a greed of getting an Australian immigration as promised by an Australian team member. Neil is now planning to lose the cycle race as well, but in order to fail his plan, Lakshya befriends Jannet (Evelyn Sharma) and makes Neil believe that the Australians are double crossing him. Neil realizes his fault and decides to win the race, but fatefully falls from stairs breaking his leg. Lakshya takes his place and beats Australia in round four leading to a tie between both teams. In the final round of rock climbing, a team member of both teams has to collect his respective country's flag from the hill top and race back to college in order to win the competition. After crossing all the hurdles, Lakshya manages to win the race and the college celebrates their victory. The story ends with Lakshya and Saloni, Jiya and Pardy getting together while Neil repents his deeds. At the end, Lakshya and Saloni kiss but Lakshya gets distracted again after seeing a nearby hot girl's butt.

The large-leaved lime tree (Tilia platyphyllos) is high and is estimated to be between 500 and 1,000 years old. The girth of the trunk is about . In 1818 the tree was badly damaged by a huge fire in the village, which caused the trunk to split in two. It developed an abnormal growth to compensate for the damage done by the fire. This lime tree has often been written about and depicted, especially in Germany, and has also been used as a case study in dendrology, the science of trees and wooded plants. With its large girth it was ranked among the biggest lime trees in Germany even in the 19th century. The Kaditz Lime is also said to have served as a kind of pillory in the Middle Ages. The German Tree Archive includes it in its list of the most significant trees in the nation (NBB ‚Äì national bedeutsame B√§ume), in which the most important criterion is the girth of the trunk measured at a height of 1 metre. Location The lime tree is situated in the centre of the village of Kaditz, a district of Dresden, on the right bank of the Elbe, where it stands on a plateau with no danger of flooding, about six kilometres north-west of the historic centre of Dresden. The Kaditz flood channel passes by the town to the south, constructed between 1918 and 1922 as part of flood prevention in Dresden on the site of an abandoned channel of the Elbe, which was eroding due to flooding at high water. The lime tree is situated at approximately above sea level and about 10 metres above the normal water level of the Elbe. The lime is situated next to the Protestant Emmaus Church, which is surrounded by a cemetery. The lime tree is protected from storms by the vicarage and the church, which stand approximately 15 metres apart. The crown spans a large part of the churchyard. A memorial to the fallen soldiers of both World Wars is situated close to the tree. The ground around the lime tree is not sealed, but partly grassed over. A few metres away stands another lime tree, which, according to the parish register, was planted in 1622. The Elbe Cycle Route, which is over long, passes through Kaditz past the lime tree. History To 1818 Emmaus Church was first mentioned in 1273, under the name of St. Lawrence's Chapel, which was dedicated to Lawrence of Rome. It is said that the lime was planted next to the chapel at the time it was built. In 1430, the Hussites set St. Lawrence's Chapel on fire, but due to favourable wind conditions the tree only suffered minimal damage. In around 1500, the church was rebuilt and a new cemetery laid out, which is now the oldest in Kaditz. Until 1862 the cemetery was the only public burial ground in Kaditz. In 1637, when the Thirty Years' War was raging in Saxony, the church was in flames again. Miraculously, the lime tree remained almost unscathed. The church remained a burnt-out ruin for years after the fire until restoration began in 1650. Remains of the Lawrence chapel form part of today's steeple. During the Thirty Years' War, Swedish troops camped under the lime tree. In 1686 the parsonage was built next to the church with the result that the lime tree was now situated between the two buildings. Despite enlargement of the churchyard in 1737, the continual shortage of space meant that some of the graves had to be placed close to the lime tree. Thus they were within the rooted area of the tree, which is typically very extensive with lime trees. In 1839 Saxonia magazine stated that the lime tree \\"probably nourished itself from the surrounding corpses\\". The advancing age and the increasing girth of the lime tree meant that it became more and more well-known. The girth of 21 ells (11.9 metres) made it a remarkable feature. Hence, the Duke of Courland, who was the third son of Friedrich August II and the grandchild of August the Strong, had the lime tree geometrically recorded in around 1750. 19th century Church in Kaditz with the lime tree, lithography from 1837 That same year, a great fire occurred in Kaditz ‚Äì this time mainly in the west of the town.Siegfried Reinhardt: Ein Baum der Superlative: Die Kaditzer Linde ‚Äì ein imposantes Naturdenkmal. In: Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten. Dresdner Nachrichten, Dresden 2007-07-27, p. 16. The fire destroyed 19 farmhouses, 30 barns and the rectory, which was located a few metres from the lime tree. The fire leapt from the parsonage onto the big lime tree and destroyed one half of the trunk, which burned down to the core.Siegfried Reinhardt: Eine Tausendj√§hrige erz√§hlt. In: Verein Neue Nachbarschaft Kaditz e. V. (Hrsg.): Typisch Kaditz: Geschichte und Geschichten. 2002, p. 65. However, the lime tree prevented the fire from spreading from the parsonage onto the church and, despite significant damage, the lime tree survived. Because of the damage, a large cavity facing the rectory opened up in the trunk, which had been hollow, but fully closed up until then. Thus the lime tree decomposed slowly from the inside.Stefan K√ºhn, Bernd Ullrich, Uwe K√ºhn: Deutschlands alte B√§ume. 2010, Chapter Tausendj√§hrige Linde in Kaditz, p. 83. The cavity inside the trunk was so big that it was possible to set up tables and chairs inside. On many occasions, young people would gather there to play music. Over a period of decades the tree's roots developed further, forming secondary trunks to strengthen the remains of the main trunk and to increase the tree's stability. Because of this phenomenon, the lime tree was often the object of excursions for teachers and students in the field of dendrology, the science of trees and wooded plants. The tree's fame increased even more after the fire and the development of its abnormal growth. Many drawings and pictures of the lime tree have emerged, one of which was displayed at an art exhibition in Dresden, which contributed to its growing popularity. One could read about the tree's fate in journals and magazines, in which the authors spared no superlatives describing the age and fortune of the Kaditz lime tree.Siegfried Reinhardt: Ein Baum der Superlative: Die Kaditzer Linde ‚Äì ein imposantes Naturdenkmal. In: Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten. Dresdner Nachrichten, Dresden 27. Juli 2007, S. 16. The great lime tree in the churchyard in Kaditz, lithography by Carl Wilhelm Arldt, after Julius Fleischmann, around 1840 In 1823, Johann Gottfried Ziller, who was the cantor at that time, noted: \\"It is remarkable that nature gradually re-covered the inner walls in the hollow of the trunk with new bark and brought new life to the trunk.\\" Seven years later, Superintendent Karl Christian Seltenreich, who was pastor of the Church of the Holy Cross in Dresden, gave the order to support the lowest and heaviest branch with pillars and timber in order to prevent it from breaking off. The construction was shaped like a gate and plastered like brickwork in order to give it the appearance of a stone pillar construction. Sachsens Kirchen-Galerie aus dem Jahre 1836 enth√§lt Angaben zur Gr√∂√üe des Stammes und einen Vergleich zu anderen Linden: ‚ÄûAuf dem Kirchhofe zu Kaditz befindet sich eine Linde, die ihres Umfanges und hohen Alters wegen bemerkenswerth ist. Die bekannte gro√üe Linde bei Augustusburg mi√üt 18 ¬Ω Ellen im Umfange ihres Stammes. Eine Linde in Schwaben wird von 18 Ellen Stammesumfang und als die √§lteste und st√§rkste in Deutschland aufgef√ºhrt. Diese, auf dem Kirchhofe zu Kaditz, mi√üt am Fu√üe 19 ¬æ Ellen. Der Greisenbaum ist hohl, und der gr√∂√üte Durchmesser seiner H√∂hlung betr√§gt 5 Ellen.\\"[19] Ein Beitrag in Saxonia, einer Zeitschrift aus dem Jahre 1839 mit der √úberschrift Die gro√üe Linde auf dem Kirchhofe zu Kaditz bei Dresden vergleicht die Kaditzer ebenfalls mit der Augustusburger Linde: ‚ÄûAuf dasigem Kirchhofe, dem Hauptthore gegen√ºber zwischen der Kirche und dem Pfarrhause, befindet sich jene durch Gr√∂√üe und Alter ausgezeichnete Linde. Ihr Stamm √ºbertrifft die Augustusburger Linde von 18 ¬Ω Elle Umfang, denn die Kaditzer fa√üt in der st√§rksten Breite 21 Ellen.\\"[4] In der Zeitschrift Das Vaterland der Sachsen aus dem Jahre 1844 wird ausf√ºhrlich √ºber die Kaditzer Linde berichtet:[15] The journal Saxony's Church Gallery (Sachsens Kirchen- Galerie) from 1836 contains references to the size of the trunk and compares it to other lime trees: \\"There is a lime tree in the churchyard of Kaditz, which is remarkable due to its circumference and great age. The circumference of the trunk of the well-known lime tree near Augustusburg measures 18 1/2 ells. A lime tree in Swabia with a girth of 18 ells is listed as the oldest and strongest in Germany. The one in the churchyard of Kaditz measures 19 3/4 ells at the root. The ancient tree is hollow, and the diameter of its cavity totals 5 ells.\\" [19] An article in Saxonia, a journal from 1839, bearing the title \\"The Great Lime Tree in the Churchyard of Kaditz Near Dresden\\" (\\"Die gro√üe Linde auf dem Kirchhofe zu Kaditz bei Dresden\\"), also compares the Kaditz lime to that at Augustusburg: \\"In that churchyard, opposite the main gate and between the church and the parsonage, stands the lime tree, which is conspicuous for its size and age. The Kaditz lime tree, measuring 21 ells at its maximum girth, surpasses the Augustusburg lime tree with a girth of 18 1/2 ells.\\" The journal The Fatherland of the Saxons [Das Vaterland der Sachsen] of 1844 reports at length about the Kaditz lime tree: > It is neither the tree's height, nor the spread of its branches that makes > it peculiar. Without doubt, it is its girth and its great age which lets the > tree compete with the most famous of the oldest trees of Saxony, and even > top them. For while the ancient lime tree of Augustusburg has a > circumference of slightly more than 18 ells, and while the one in Annaberg, > which is especially remarkable because it must once have been planted upside > down in its former location, do not reach this girth, the periphery of the > trunk of the Kaditz lime tree, with a height of 8 to 10 ells, measures not > less than 39 ¬Ω feet. and > According to a not improbable report given by older residents, the old trunk > of the lime tree served as a pillory for those who had forfeited church > penance; and indeed some iron rings and clips, almost completely overgrown > by the bark, can still be found in the trunk. It appears that in the more > recent centuries it was frequently necessary to saw off the far too high and > strong branches, partly because they were disadvantageous for the roof of > the church and the rectory, and partly because they had threatened to tear > apart and destroy the trunk, which became increasingly hollow. This created > over time the big, chimney-like holes in the trunk, through which many a > jocund fellow crawled in order to present his head merrily to his playmates > as a young fruit of the old tree. ‚Äì Das Vaterland der Sachsen. 1844. Recent history The municipality of Kaditz lost its autonomy and became part of Dresden in 1903. The village lime tree became a city idyll, as it was extolled on postcards. The daily newspaper Saxon News wrote in 1909: \\"The colossal Kaditz lime tree that stands in the cemetery of the village of Kaditzis one of the oldest trees in Saxony, perhaps even one of the oldest trees in Germany. The girth measured 12.5 metres and the diameter 4 metres.\\" On 7 June 1925, a war memorial that stands about 22 yards away from the lime tree was inaugurated in a ceremonial act. It shows a large, carved stone eagle that faces the tree. In 1945 in the early days after the Second World War, an inhabitant of Kaditz was said to have hidden in the hollow trunk by night in order to escape the raids in the houses. Around 1960 very old graves around the roots of the lime tree were exposed and cleared. Over the years a very small second trunk had grown out of the hollow of the trunk, which was open on one side. The space between both trunk segments grew over time. The pastor at the time, Karl-Heinz Scharf, devoted himself to the history of the lime tree. This contributed to the tree's popularity and consequently, around 1970, bridal couples began visiting the tree after the church ceremony. With this Scharf sought to symbolise the shared path through life that newlyweds must stick to in the face of whatever obstacles. The lattice fence protecting the tree was removed for these services. The lime tree was named the \\"flagship of all lime trees\\" in 1975. Since that year, the trunk of the lime tree has been protected by two new lattice fences. On 3 September 1985 the area was declared a natural monument, along with 30 further trees, according to a resolution passed by Dresden city council. This has resulted in regular checks and care of the tree. In 1996 the crown was braced at a cost of roughly 7,000 British pounds. In 1997 a Swiss firm applied for the rights to a gravel quarry in the Kaditzer area, which would have extended beyond the year 2010. This would have caused the water table to sink so low as to dry out the lime tree. Dresden's regional city council however rejected the application after countless residents and members of open institutions had voiced their opposition. In 2008, a branch of the smaller part of the trunk was on the verge of breaking off with the upper part of the bark, so it had to be supported by a metal strut. During the flood of the century in 2002 Kaditz was completely enclosed by water; the lower districts were flooded. The flood water flowed over the high cemetery wall and submerged the graves in the cemetery. The water stopped at the highest point of the area, on the threshold of the church and just in front of the lime tree's main trunk. In 2003, the new sign and a new information board were placed next to the old natural monument with the owl. In recent times too there have been regular reports about the lime tree in both newspapers and books. The silviculturist and conservationist Hans Joachim Fr√∂hlich, initiator of the Association of Old Adorable Trees in Germany (Alte liebenswerte B√§ume in Deutschland e. V.), wrote in 2000: \\"The lime tree is a monumental tree with many feet, arms and bodies.\\" The Dresden newspaper Dresdner Neuesten Nachrichten published an article on the lime tree on April 3, 2004 with the headline, \\"Methuselah of the trees\\". \\"Kaditz lime tree - Older than the city. After it burned down to a torso in the village fire of 1818, the lime tree next to the Kaditz church still bears new shoots every spring. With an estimated age of a thousand years, the Kaditz lime tree is the oldest tree in Dresden.\\" Description Before the fire in 1818 the trunk was, in fact, already hollow, but it was completely sealed. During the fire a section of the trunk was charred and it formed a hole. The hole expanded when the tree later lost another main bough, as the part of the tree supporting it was rotten and collapsed under the weight. Over time the trunk divided into two halves, which increasingly grew apart. The smaller of the two parts, which stands completely isolated several metres from the main trunk, is still only around 20 √ó 100 cm and has a couple of smaller branches that grow new leaves each year. The larger trunk was not damaged by fire in 1818 and is unusually sturdy and has lots of holes. Diameter of the trunk Since the beginning of the 19th century numerous reports have given concrete measurements that differ in units of length. Although having decreased in girth because of the huge fire in 1818, the lime tree still had more than 10 metres of girth when it was measured back in the 19th century. In Sachsens Kirchen-Galerie (i.e. \\"Saxony‚Äôs church gallery\\") the girth of the trunk was stated to be of 19 ¬æ cubits in 1836. Saxonia nannte im Jahre 1839 einen Umfang von 21 Ellen. In 1839 Saxonia stated the girth to be of 21 cubits. Im Jahre 1856 wurde in Flora oder allgemeine botanische Zeitung der Umfang am Stammfu√ü mit 18 Ellen angegeben. The 1844 edition of Das Vaterland der Sachsen (Fatherland of the Saxons) claimed that the girth was 39 ¬Ω feet. In Flora oder allgemeine botanische Zeitung (Flora or General Botanic Magazine), the girth at the foot of the trunk was said to be of 18 cubits. Historical depictions 1802 depiction next to the burned out churchThe interior of the Emmaus Church was redesigned in the Baroque style from 1750 to 1756 and a ceiling painting was added. The fresco depicts an apocalyptical angel with five candleholders. In the background there is an enormous tree, which appears odd due to its girth and size: it is thus supposed to depict the Kaditz lime tree. The copperplate engraving from 1782 is attributed to the artist Johann Christian Klengel and depicts the tree among the graves in the Kaditz churchyard and is the oldest known pictorial representation of the tree. During a fire in east Kaditz in 1802 the parsonage too was damaged, whilst the lime tree was once again barely touched. A lithograph from approximately 1802 by the artist Gustav Taubert shows the burned out parsonage with the lime tree and church in the background. In 1812 Napoleon's soldiers trooped through the village past the lime tree.Jan H√ºbler: Dresden: 66 Lieblingspl√§tze und 11 Erlebnistouren. 1. Auflage. Gmeiner-Verlag, Dresden 2012, , Kapitel Kaditzer Linde: Der √§lteste Baum Dresdens in Altkaditz, S. 139. An excerpt from page 128 of the book Dresden und das Elbgel√§nde (Dresden and the area around the river Elbe), which was published in 1818 by the Association for the Promotion of Dresden and its Tourism, reads \\"An ancient lime tree in the churchyard\\". Events Every year on the day of Saint John the Baptist a traditional evensong is held with the church's faithful and after that a collective singing of folk songs takes place.Siegfried Reinhardt: Eine Tausendj√§hrige erz√§hlt. In: Verein Neue Nachbarschaft Kaditz e. V. (Hrsg.): Typisch Kaditz: Geschichte und Geschichten. 2002, p. 67. Reports go back to 1830: \\"So people went to the church, in front of which the old, honourable lime tree, which surely is one of the biggest in Germany (perimeter of 18 cubits), was draped with wreaths.\\" During the 2010 Football World Cup the first match with German participation was broadcast in a public viewing event under the lime tree. Concerts, belonging to a series of concerts called \\"Orgel plus\\", are staged in the Emmaus Church several times a year. They are organised by the \\"F√∂rderkreis Kirchenmusik Laurentius Dresden e.V.\\", a group of voluntary workers supporting church music. After the concerts people meet for a gemuetlich gathering under the lime tree and drink beverages together. Anecdotes Goethe Johann Wolfgang von Goethe visited Dresden a total of seven times. Being interested in history and a literate artist, who used to research and publicize in different natural scientific areas, he was likely to be interested in the lime tree, which was widely known among natural scientific interested people, because of its high age and its tall growth. During his final stay in Dresden in August 1813 or already in 1810 he is said to have visited the Kaditz Lime Tree and to have been very impressed by its superb figure and its high age. Goethe's visit is said to be noted in a book although it is not known which book it is. Pillory According to the tradition, the lime ‚Äì tree was used as a pillory in the medieval times, apparently chained delinquents would be shown up in front of the lime tree until the 18th century. Church goers would pass them and give them despised and taunting looks. In Saxony's church gallery in 1836 it is written: \\"According to the elder, who retell from their fathers, the trunk was used as a pillory during the usual repentance. The iron collars which were installed for this purpose still remain, but the two half- circles have moved 2 cubits apart from each other due to the enlargement of the tree.\\"  See also  * Reinberg Lime References External links * Category:Individual trees in Germany Category:Tourist attractions in Dresden Category:Individual lime trees ","title":"Kaditz Lime Tree"},{"id":"37895851","text":"The Oriel Noetics is a term now applied to a group of early 19th-century dons of the University of Oxford closely associated with Oriel College. John Tulloch in 1885 wrote about them as the \\"early Oriel school\\" of theologians, the contrast being with the Tractarians, also strongly based in Oriel. The Noetics were moderate freethinkers and reformers within the Church of England. In terms of Anglican religious parties, the Noetics were High Church opponents of evangelicalism, but adhered also to a rationalism from the previous century. They advocated for a \\"national religion\\" or national church, and in their own view stood for orthodoxy rather than liberalism. In politics, they were associated with the Whigs, and influenced prominent statesmen such as Lord John Russell, Viscount Morpeth, and Thomas Spring Rice. Distinctively, the Noetics combined natural theology with political economy. Their approach had something in common with that of Thomas Chalmers, and had much support at the time outside the college in Oxford, and more widely.Peter Mandler, Tories and Paupers: Christian Political Economy and the Making of the New Poor Law, The Historical Journal, Vol. 33, No. 1, Mar., 1990, Cambridge University Press, p. 86 note 20; Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2639392. The Noetics at Oriel Oriel College at the beginning of the 19th century had a policy of recruitment of Fellows on merit, disregarding both patronage and examination classes in search of intellectual calibre. The college was also abstemious, compared with the others, and the \\"Oriel teapot\\" became proverbial. Prominent Noetics who were directly associated with Oriel included the successive Provosts John Eveleigh and Edward Copleston. Others who were Fellows of the College for some period were Thomas Arnold, Joseph Blanco White, Renn Dickson Hampden, Edward Hawkins, and Richard Whately. Baden Powell was an undergraduate at Oriel. John Davison was excluded from the group of Noetics when William Tuckwell wrote about them in the early 20th century, but is counted by Richard Brent in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Relationship with the High Church men The Edinburgh Review called Oriel under Copleston \\"the school of speculative philosophy in England\\". This was in a review of a supplement by Dugald Stewart to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Copleston was seen by Edward William Grinfield in 1821 as undermining the orthodox Anglicanism of Joseph Butler's natural theology. He took care to rebut this charge; and Grinfield in the British Critic was represented as over-impressed by Oriel's reputation. Baden Powell remained close to his High Church roots, an ally of the Hackney Phalanx. John Henry Overton argued that Copleston was his own man, not attached to a church party; and that his leaving Oxford in 1827 as a bishop removed his influence.John Henry Overton, The English Church in the Nineteenth Century, 1800-1833 (1893), p. 117;archive.org. A split in views developed in the run-up to the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, which left the Oriel group and the diehard Hackney Phalanx on opposite sides of the question, Baden Powell siding with the reforming views of others in the college. Relationship with the Tractarians The rise of the \\"Oxford Movement\\" proved very divisive within Oriel College, where John Keble, John Henry Newman and Hurrell Froude held positions. The successor to Copleston as Provost was Hawkins. By 1833 the fellowship split with four fellows opposed to the incipient Tractarian moves, while more were broadly supportive. Hawkins was an early influence on Newman, but his election (defeating Keble) blocked internal changes to college teaching in 1831, which Newman, Froude and Robert Wilberforce wished to have more of a pastoral content; the other tutor of the time, Joseph Dornford, supported Hawkins. Political economy The Noetics stood for a degree of curriculum reform in the university, in the form of optional courses. As part of this drive, Copleston and Whately in 1831 introduced a course on political economy, treated in the context of natural theology. It drew on Whately's Elements of Logic, which had an appendix on political economy by Nassau Senior. Whately was Drummond Professor of Political Economy for a year after Senior, but left Oxford in 1831. Social policy It has been claimed that the composition of the Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832 was heavily slanted towards followers of the Noetics. Among reformers involved named as aligned with the Noetics and their views are William Sturges Bourne, Walter Coulson, and Henry Gawler. Edwin Chadwick, an assistant commissioner, had contributed to the London Review founded as an organ for the Noetics.

The Davis Dry Dock Company had an excellent reputation for the quality of their yachts, launches and lifeboats, and company owner John Davis wanted to build a car to the same high standards. The prototype was going to be built as a tourer, but Davis's son Lloyd took over development of the car and made it into a sedan. The prototype was nearly finished when it was damaged in a fire. It was rebuilt as a roadster, with a body of finished aluminium. The Fleetwood-Knight was powered by a 6-cylinder Knight sleeve valve engine, which gave excellent performance. The car was very well appointed, with gasoline and temperature gauges on the dashboard. Unfortunately for the Davises, the prototype cost between CDN$5,000 and CDN$6,000 to build, so it was not economically viable to put the car in production. The car was driven by members of the Davis family until sold, and was still in regular use in Renfrew, Ontario in the late 1960s.

The building served as the city hall for the Council of the City of Newcastle between 1929 and 1977. The building, located at 289 King Street, was designed by noted theatre architect Henry Eli White and the foundation stone was laid by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Dudley de Chair, on 20 April 1928. The three-storey building structure is based on a steel frame that supports concrete floors and stone cladding. Local material were used as much as possible, including steel provided at a discount by local steel-maker, BHP. Architectural features include a clock tower, porte cochere, balustrades and stairs, all built with Sydney sandstone. The clock tower is an imposing landmark and distinctive feature of the city sky line, indicating the Civic Centre of Newcastle. The tower is a reinforced concrete and steel framed structure clad in Sydney yellowblock sandstone ashlar with rusticated quoins. Interior spaces include a ballroom, concert hall and additional function rooms. The administrative offices of the city hall were relocated to the new Civic Administration Centre in 1977, though the council chambers remain. The clock tower suffered some damage as a result of the 1989 Newcastle earthquake, however this was subsequently repaired. Together with the Newcastle Civic Theatre, each site is, individually, of state heritage significance, and they are listed jointly on the New South Wales State Heritage Register as the Newcastle City Hall and Civic Theatre Precinct.  History  Local Government began in Newcastle in 1843 with the Newcastle District Council. This body, however, was not embraced by locals and Councillors were often appointed by the Government as no nominations had been received. When the Municipalities Act was passed in 1858, there was considerably more interest, with a large number of locals signing the petition to form the Municipality of Newcastle. Meetings of the Council were initially held at the Court House on the corner of Hunter and Bolton Streets. The town's first Mayor was James Hannell. At this time the Newcastle Municipality encompassed only the central Newcastle area, with a number of the surrounding satellite communities, including Hamilton, Lambton, Waratah and others, which are now part of Newcastle Local Government Area, becoming separate municipalities over the following decades.Conservation Management Plan, p. 18 The meetings of Newcastle Council continued to be conducted in the Court House, and Council business was undertaken in a small room in the Borough Markets. In 1874 these two functions were brought together under one roof, in the convict built former Commissioner Store in Watt Street, which had served as Post Office until 1872. A decade later a purpose built Council Chambers was erected on the same site in front of the Commissioner Store building, which was used as a store until demolition in 1923. It was designed by the City Engineer, John Sharp, and contained a meeting hall and offices for the Mayor and Town Clerk, on the ground floor, and further offices on the first floor. The Council Chambers in Watt Street quickly proved to be inadequate, both in terms of space, and, it would seem, local aspirations. Only four years after it was built the first moves were made towards the construction of a Town Hall. In 1890 a design competition was held for a Town Hall and civic shopping arcade on Hunter Street. The competition was won by eminent local architect Frederick Menkens. However, the project did not proceed, partly due to Council's inability to raise the required funds. Over the following three-and-a-half decades a long series of plans failed to materialise. The need for new premises was intensified following the 1919 Local Government Act, which increased the powers of local government. The existing Council Chambers was extended, but Council staff were still scattered through four separate buildings in Watt Street due to lack of space. At the same time, Newcastle's growing population placed further pressure on the inadequate facilities for public meetings. By 1921 the population of the Newcastle area reached 84,372, an increase of 30,000 across the previous decade.Conservation Management Plan, pp. 19-20 In January 1920 a referendum of rate payers was held to gauge community support for raising a loan to purchase a suitable site for the construction of a Town Hall. 682 people voted, and supported the move by a large majority. The next hurdle was to find a suitable site. After the acquisition of a site owned by John Brown in Hunter Street was thwarted, the community was again involved in a September referendum to decide whether the Town Hall should be constructed in the east or west end of town (either side of Burwood Street). Considerably fewer votes were cast, and an east end location was favoured by a small majority. After the decision to purchase land bound by Hunter, Darby, King and Burwood Streets for a Town Hall based on Menkens' design, yet another attempt was abandoned due to the cost of resumption and compensation of existing businesses. This issue of a Town Hall was again postponed.Conservation Management Plan, pp. 20-21 The election of Morris Light as Mayor of Newcastle in 1924 was a turning point. He was a man of vision and determination who had served on Newcastle and Carrington Councils for 35 years. In February 1925 Light began the final, successful scheme to build a Town Hall for Newcastle, recognising that the city had long ago outgrown the existing Council Chambers. In June 1925 the report produced by the specially appointed Town Hall Special Committee for the construction of a Town Hall, theatre and business premises on the present, central site was adopted. The appointment of Mr Henry Eli White as architect and the taking of a 175,000 pound loan were approved. Although Light died before the completion of the project, he is widely recognised as the man who made it happen, a pair of memorial light standards at the main entrance to the Town Hall commemorates his contribution. It was after lengthy debate that Council commissioned Henry Eli White for the design. Council was anxious to engage an architect with experience in theatre design. White had developed a passion for theatre design in 1907 and his 3 essentials were vision lines, acoustics and ventilation. The reputation that drew White to the attention of Council aldermen was firmly established by 1915. He was one of the most successful theatre architects in the country, having designed or redesigned a number of theatres in New Zealand and Australia by the mid 1920s, such as the Tivoli Brisbane and the Theatre Royal, Sydney. Although his main focus was on theatres White had also designed a variety of other prominent commercial and industrial buildings including the Bunnerong Power House, a contract won in 1925. In August 1925 White submitted the Town Hall plans which were placed on public display in the Hunter Street window of Scott's Store. Plans for the Theatre and shops were presented soon after.Conservation Management Plan, p. 24 In 1926 there was community debate over the inclusion of a large theatre in the commission. One of the more vocal opponents was the manager of the Victoria Theatre. Through the local press, an unceasing opposition campaign was conducted against the construction of a new theatre in Newcastle. Consequently, a poll of ratepayers occurred in 1926 at which voters were asked to indicate their preference for a town hall, theatre and shops or a town hall only. A majority were in support of the proposal to include the theatre in the design and a successful application under the Local Government Act to raise two hundred thousand pounds led to the resumption of land.Conservation Management Plan, pp. 26-7 The design of the town hall and theatre/shops complex was let as a single contract but separate tenders were called for the construction of the two buildings. The successful tenderer was the firm of Charles Davis and Son, which submitted the lowest tender of 82,927 pounds. Among the firm's larger contracts were the AMP block, remodelling of the Council's market street buildings, the Commercial Bank, and several hotels including the Crown and Anchor. His domestic work included Braeside at Waratah, designed by Frederick Menkens.Conservation Management Plan, pp. 27-8 In July 1927, the Council resumed just over 2 acres of land for the civic complex, including a site owned by John Brown. Included in the resumption were 10 lots in Section A of the original 2000 acre grant to the Australian Agricultural Company. Newcastle City Hall still stands on Lots 10, 11, and 12 of this portion, while Christie Place occupies Lots 13 and 14 with Wheeler Place occupying lot 9. The firm of Archibald Rodgers previously occupied the site. The firm was established in Carrington in 1854. In 1870 the name was changed to Rodgers Bros. and the business moved to King Street on which City Hall now stands. The land was swampy and required six feet of fill to prepare it for the new engineering works including a blacksmiths' shop, fitting and machine shop and a moulding shop. Following resumption by Council in 1927, the buildings were auctioned or demolished. Part of the site now containing Nesca House was retained by Rodgers Bros. This land was resumed in 1936 for the construction of Nesca House.Conservation Management Plan, p. 23 In November 1927, Council decided to change the external cladding material from brick and cement to freestone. This was first noted in the Council minutes in November 1927. Within three weeks the decision had been made and the building was to be faced with 30,000 super feet of stone from Waverley in Sydney, increasing the cost of the project by 26,480 pounds. The work was suspended until government approval was granted for an additional loan of 81,000 pounds to cover the cost of the stone and increased land acquisition costs. The loan was finally repaid in 1960. Given the history of community consultation on significant issues relating to the Town Hall proposal, it can only be assumed that Council did not invite further delay of the project at this stage. There is no evidence of opposition from the community.Conservation Management Plan, p. 28 Pouring the foundations of Cockle Creek concrete reinforced with BHP steel began on March 7, 1928. Seven tons of steel were used in one area at the base of the tower. Existing overhead high tension mains in the vicinity of the site were put underground to allow an unimpeded view of the Town Hall, and a substation constructed to the west of the building. The foundation stone was laid on April 20, 1928 by the Governor Sir Dudley de Chair, who travelled by train to Newcastle. He described the people of Newcastle as industrious and enterprising and declared the Town Hall \\"one of the noblest structures of the kind which has been erected in the State\\". He then laid the foundation stone of polished trachyte.Conservation Management Plan, p. 29 As a general policy in construction of the Town hall, the Council preferred to use local materials, suppliers and contractors. British steel had been specified but steps were taken to substitute BHP steel. BHP steel was more expensive than the specified imported product, and Council approached the BHP to bear half the costs of the steel, which they accepted, reducing the cost of the steel by 250 pounds.Conservation Management Plan, p. 30 Although the Council had agreed that the Town Clerk be responsible for the interior design, it was later decided that the professional advice should be sought. J. V. Rowe, recognised furnishing expert, was engaged to undertake the interior decoration. Rowe had come to Australia in 1904 as chief designer for Wunderlich. He is credited with introducing Art Nouveau to Wunderlich. He continued to work for the firm until 1925. He was Principal of the East Sydney Technical College. Previous commissions include the Royal Automobile Club in Sydney, Rose Bay Golf Club and private homes in Sydney. On December 14, 1929, the Governor Sir Dudley de Chair returned to Newcastle to open the town hall. The adjacent Civic Theatre was opened by the Premier, Thomas Bavin. To mark the opening, Council declared \\"Civic Week\\", a week of celebrations.Conservation Management Plan, p. 31 The clock was initially to be a gift to the city but the cost of 850 pounds was borne by the Council. At the time the clock was seen as a worthy rival to London's Big Ben. The clock and bell were supplied by Prouds, together with 15 small electric clocks which were synchronised with the father clock.Conservation Management Plan, p. 35 Morris Light's concept was for a town hall and offices together with an art gallery and museum. This was later modified to encompass the Civic Theatre including an exhibition hall and 14 shops, public open spaces (Christie Place and Civic Park) and new roads (Wheeler Place and Christie Street). The construction of the City hall and the Civic Theatre was the catalyst for the transformation of this part of the city centre. White was instrumental in having the buildings in Civic Park removed and the land resumed as park. In 1949 a precinct plan was prepared by the Northumberland County Council which established a site for the War memorial cultural centre (Newcastle Region Library) at the southern end of the axis established by City Hall. This is a similar planning model to Parliament House in Canberra and the National War Memorial.Conservation Management Plan, p. 38 This generous vision for the civic precinct which forms the centre of today's Newcastle, and the lavish construction of the Town Hall and adjacent Civic Theatre was made possible by the optimism and booming economy of the early-mid 1920s. The use of a classical style for the Town Hall is reflective of a persistent belief in the western world that the true architecture \\"had its roots in Greece, Rome and the Renaiisance and that some form of classicism was the only safe port in a stormy sea of change\\" that was the early twentieth century.Apperly, Irving and Reynolds, p. 154 In 1937 the 11 borough councils in Newcastle were amalgamated to form the City of Newcastle and the Town Hall became the legislative and administrative hub from this time. The name was changed to City Hall in honour of this event.Conservation Management Plan, p. 46 During the war years City Hall formed an important hub for charitable and patriotic organisations as community activities of this nature burgeoned, and also hosted recruitment rallies, patriotic fundraising concerts, returned soldiers events. A request by the Anti-Conscription Committee to hold a meeting in the City Hall, on the other hand, was denied by the Mayor, to the chagrin of the Trades Hall Council. The alliance between the British Empire, Soviet Union and United States was marked by the hoisting of the Red Flag on the City Hall in October 1941, and additional flagpoles were erected on the building to allow the Union Jack, the American, Soviet and Greek flags to be raised daily. The National Emergency Services organisation was moved into the No. 1 Committee Room in the City Hall in March 1941, and in January 1942, as the war seemed to draw perilously close to NSW, the main door of the City Hall was bricked up as a protection against potential blasts.Conservation Management Plan, p. 47 Through the 1930s and 1940s settlement and damp issues were addressed. Several alterations were made to the stage in the main auditorium during the 1940s and 1950s, the provision of improved lighting and a larger stage area to allow ballet and orchestral performances. This was necessary because the Civic Theatre had become such a popular, and profitable, venue for movies that such performances had been squeezed out. By the late 1950s and 1960s the City Hall was becoming crowded and the City Engineer, Aldermen and the public jostled for space. Both public and staff facilities were seen as shabby and inadequate. Writing to the Newcastle Morning Herald in 4 May 1966 \\"Hostess\\" captured the concerns of the public for their city's reputation, writing \\"Most visitors to Newcastle go to the City Hall which is in a sense our \\"lounge room\\" so how about a brighter welcome?\\" The pressure was finally relieved with the construction of the Civic Administration Centre in 1977, and the relocation of all administrative functions out of the City Hall. The City Hall itself was to remain the focus of civic life, and after half a century of only minor maintenance work, needed a thorough going over. Local architects Suters and Busteed and local builder R W Black were engaged to carry out refurbishment works aiming to incorporate new services, such as air conditioning, and converting previous office space into public spaces, at the same time as maintaining and enhancing the dignity of the original design. In 1981 these works received an award from the Royal Australian Institute of Architects as one of the best examples of building recycling in NSW.Conservation Management Plan, pp. 48-51 The City Hall was largely spared by the 1989 earthquake, but some repairs to the tower were necessary. After 2001 major stonework conservation was undertakenConservation Management Plan, p. 2 The City Hall continues to house Council Chambers, as well as hosting civic receptions, community gatherings, weddings, national and international conferences, trade shows, seminars, corporate meetings, product launches and social functions.  Description  Neo-classical columns Clock tower Newcastle City Hall is a three storey stone-clad building in the Inter-War Academic Classical style. It is supported by a steel frame and reinforced concrete floors. Like the similar Brisbane Town Hall, its design follows the precedent established in the nineteenth century, where the strong vertical mass of a central tower emerges from a relatively low base over three storeys. The building features imposing symmetrical pavilions with coupled Roman Doric and Ionic orders on the three main facades, which are designed to be seen \\"in- the-round\\". On the southern, King Street, facade a Porte Cochere is supported by sandstone Roman Doric style columns, the balustrade above the entablature has circular turned balusters. The balusters are slim and have been largely replaced by synthetic stone balusters. The upper two storeys of the major facades are treated as a single storey united by Ionic columns. The ground floor is treated as a rusticated plinth. This device prevents the classical detailing on the building looking distorted. The rear elevation, backing onto Christie Lane, is painted cement render. A deep continuous base course is broken by two original escape doors and a new escape door introduced in 1980. Sandstone quoins return on both ends, three moulded string courses and a cornice being the only features. Blind windows are then used to excellent effect. The external wall cladding and elements such as the Porte Cochere, the clock tower, balconies, balustrades and external stairs are built of Sydney \\"yellowblock\\" sandstone. Externally, metal grilles, window and door frames are used. A vehicular ramp leads up to the main entrance midway between the ground and first floor levels. The entrance is then enclosed in the Porte-Cochere. The flat roof of the Porte-Cochere provides a terrace off the main staircase midway between first and second floors. This ingenious planning device clearly defines an imposing entrance and again helps break the height and bulk of the building. The scale is further reduced by means of a flight of steps from King Street. The clock tower is an imposing landmark and distinctive feature of the city sky line, indicating the Civic Centre of Newcastle. The tower is a reinforced concrete and steel framed structure clad in Sydney yellowblock sandstone ashlar with rusticated quoins. The City Hall was reported to be in good physical condition as at 3 May 2013. Current use The concert hall, stage and upper gallery is frequently used by a wide range of community and commercial groups as a platform for staging choirs, orchestras, plays or other musical performances. Additional function rooms cater for civic receptions, community gatherings, weddings, national and international conferences, trade shows, seminars, corporate meetings, product launches and social functions.  Heritage listing  Newcastle City Hall is of historic and aesthetic significance to the State of NSW as an imposing civic building embodying the civic pride of NSW's second city in a restrained inter-war classicism. City Hall is an outstanding example of the Inter-War Academic Classical style in NSW. The building's planning, construction and history of use demonstrates the evolution of local government in Newcastle, reflecting the growth, development and increased power of local government across the twentieth century in New South Wales. The style of the building is illustrative of significant social and aesthetic values of the inter-war period in NSW, demonstrating a desire to hold onto traditional forms of architectural stylism particularly in public architecture, in the face of modernism and social and political change. Locally, the architectural pretensions and central Newcastle site demonstrates the perceived centrality of local government to the City of Newcastle during the interwar years, and ambition of mayors and civic leaders to leave their mark on the city by transforming this previously industrial area into a unique cultural precinct to form the civic heart of the City. City Hall has strong associations with its designer Henry Eli White, an internationally noted theatre architect of the early twentieth century, and JV Rowe, principal designer for the Wunderlich company from 1904 to 1925, responsible for the original interior finishes and decoration. Locally the City Hall has a significant association with Alderman Morris Light (1859-1929), Mayor and businessman, the realisation of the City Hall and Civic Theatre complex being his greatest achievement. The building is also associated with Alderman Joy Cummings, who was the first female Lord Mayor in Australia. Newcastle City Hall was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 September 2012.

He is also featured in a popular internet meme, depicting a still of him in a video showing a winning chess move, usually with the text ‚ÄúOutstanding move‚Äù shown in front of the image.  Biography  Leontxo Garc√≠a got into chess relatively late: he learned to play at school, when he was 13, but he didn't start to play seriously until he was 17. In 1975, at age 19, he became the absolute champion of Guip√∫zcoa and six years later, in 1981, he achieved the FIDE Master title. Later he achieved two International Master norms and everything suggested that he would devote to play chess when he was approached, in 1983, by the Basque newspaper Deia to be the special correspondent at the Kasparov‚ÄìKorchnoi and Smyslov‚ÄìRibli matches (London). It was then when he discovered that his vocation as journalist was even stronger than his vocation as player, and shortly after he stopped participating in chess competitions. From Deia Leontxo went on to Agence France-Presse, Spanish news agency EFE and La Gaceta del Norte, a former Bilbao newspaper; later he worked for the radio network Cadena SER and, finally, for El Pa√≠s (in 1985 he was special correspondent for two and a half months for the second Kasparov- Karpov match, in Moscow, and now he has a daily column at this newspaper) and Radio Nacional de Espa√±a (1986). During those years he also worked with other media such as Radio Moscow, former magazine El Globo and, later, Argentine newspaper La Prensa. During the World Match Kasparov‚ÄìKarpov in Seville 1987 he presented 50 special programmes at Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola (TVE) on a daily basis. Leontxo ran Jaque magazine for ten years (1991‚Äì2001) and has lectured chess in many countries.Biograf√≠a de Leontxo Garc√≠a en Chessbase; retrieved December 12, 2012 He ran and presented En Jaque (In Check), a 39 programmes series broadcast by TVE (1990‚Äì91), and produced, with Kasparov, the series La pasi√≥n del ajedrez (The passion for chess), containing 64 magazines and 25 videos, at Editorial Salvat (1998‚Äì99). As chess instructor for the Basque Government (1985), he has experience coaching children and has taught postgraduate chess courses to school teachers. He's broadcast on several occasions the chess commentaries of the most important tournaments, such as the Ciudad de Linares, Grand Slam Masters Final (Bilbao, Shanghai and S√£o Paulo), World Championship, etc. But his journalist effort goes beyond the game-science; he writes about other sports (suffice it to say that he was special correspondent for El Pa√≠s at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games; that he produced and presented the series Destino Atenas (Destination: Athens) about the 28 olympic sports at Radio Nacional in 2004 and that he wrote a book about Radomir Antiƒá) and international politics. His second specialty sport is handball, and he has covered several World and Europe Championships for El Pa√≠s, Radio Nacional and Agencia Colpisa. Since 2007 Leontxo has a regular section (Sundays at 09.20) at the popular programme No es un d√≠a cualquiera, with Pepa Fern√°ndez, at RNE Radio Nacional. Tireless chess propagandist, Leontxo promotes the teaching of this game to both children (in Spanish schools and abroad)El ajedrez retrasa el envejecimiento cerebral y puede prevenir el Alzheimer, La Provincia - Diario de Las Palmas, June 9, 2011, in Spanish; retrieved December 12, 2012 and adults. \\"Regular chess exercise improves brain aging and may even be useful in preventing Alzheimer's and other senile dementias\\", he says.Ang√©lica Gonz√°lez. Cuando pierdes al ajedrez no le puedes echar la culpa a nadie, Diario de Burgos, April 30, 2011, in Spanish; retrieved December 12, 2012 Leontxo thinks Spain needs a Rafael Nadal of chess: \\"It's the country with more international tournaments, about a hundred. In over a thousand schools chess is taught as an extracurricular activity... but it lacks a champion. Vallejo could have been it but he's lacked dedication. I'm confident about the Galician Iv√°n Salgado, aged 19, junior world runner. We'll see.\\".P. Etxaniz.

The series began with The Book With No Name, which was originally published in 2006 through Lulu.com, but has since been re-released through Michael O'Mara Books. The books center on a supernatural serial killer only known as the \\"Bourbon Kid\\". The first book in the series was initially written with the intent to make it a Western novel, with the author choosing to move the series to present day partway through the book. The Bourbon Kid series has been published in multiple languages, including Spanish, French, German, Polish and English. Background The first book in the series, The Book With No Name, was initially published on the internet due to a lack of interest from publishers. The author stated that this was due to him refusing to give the publishers his name as well as the book not fitting into any specific genre. In an interview with L'Express the author mentioned that he had begun working on a fourth book in the series entitled The Book of Death, but temporarily shelved it due to the writing process becoming too unpleasant. The book was later published in France due to a successful Facebook campaign by fans of the author. It was subsequently published in German, English and Spanish. Sales of the books exceed 2 million copies. Synopsis The series premise centers around antihero Bourbon Kid, who as a teenager becomes a supernatural serial killer after drinking some tainted alcohol. As the series progresses he becomes hunted by several different groups of people and must find a way to stop the evil plans of various villains. In 2013 the author began a new series featuring another serial killer known as The Red Mohawk. In 2015 the Bourbon Kid and Red Mohawk teamed up in The Plot to Kill the Pope.

Tacitus mentions the Naharvali as the keepers of the sanctuary of the Lugii, a grove dedicated to the twin gods Alcis. The Nahanarvali are speculated by modern scholars to be the same as the Silingi.

These vehicles ranged in size from runabouts to a 7-passenger tourer, as well as two cars designed for the Ledoux Carriage Company in 1914. Bourassa's final car used a Rickenbacker chassis, and featured an L-head engine with a special manifold and electrically heated carburetor, and transmission of his own design. The car gave excellent fuel economy of 31 miles per gallon, but no investors were prepared to give Bourassa the finances needed to get the car into production. After six years of trying to get the car into production, Bourassa had the car demolished in 1932. Aside from his vehicles, Bourassa's main claim to fame was that Louis Chevrolet lived with Bourassa for eight months after his arrival in Canada from France.

History Social Teeth was founded in June 2012 by Stanford graduate Elaine Chang. Chang developed the idea in late 2011, frustrated by the disproportionate influence of super PACs and other moneyed special interests on the airwaves. In an interview with The Guardian Chang stated: \\"In an election season dominated by big money from small numbers of people, I wanted to give all of us the chance to get involved and fight against the influence of big money in politics.\\" Steve Hilton, former director of strategy for British Prime Minister David Cameron, soon joined as an advisor to the organization. The site was one of four winning entries in a competition held by Stanford's d.school Institute of Design, gaining a presentation slot in the Aspen Ideas Festival, an annual gathering of global intellectual leaders put on by the Aspen Institute. Social Teeth's first round of ads consisted of six video campaigns chosen through a public voting contest. The ad campaigns ranged from support of marriage equality to Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson. Funding Model The Social Teeth platform works much like Kickstarter. Users submit independently produced broadcast-quality ads which have already gained popularity on social media networks like Facebook or Twitter to the Social Teeth website. Supporters then pledge money to particular campaigns. If the ad is funded on time, Social Teeth purchases spots on other media channels such as TV and online advertisements, with the assistance of partner organization Aegis Group, a global media buying firm.

Thus, all great civilizations that share similar cultural practices, such as construction of pyramids, derived them from a single common progenitor. According to its proponents, examples of hyperdiffusion can be found in religious practices, cultural technologies, megalithic monuments, and lost ancient civilizations. The idea of hyperdiffusionism differs in several ways from trans-cultural diffusion, one being that hyperdiffusionism is usually not testable due to its pseudo-scientific nature. Additionally, unlike trans-cultural diffusion, hyperdiffusionism does not use trading and cultural networks to explain the expansion of a society within a single culture; instead, hyperdiffusionists claim that all major cultural innovations and societies derive from one (usually lost) ancient civilization. Ergo, the Tucson artifacts derive from ancient Rome, carried by the \\"Romans who came across the Atlantic and then overland to Arizona;\\" this is believed because the artifacts resembled known ancient Roman artifacts. Mainstream archeologists regard the hyperdiffusionism hypothesis as pseudoarchaeology.  Some key proponents   Charles Hapgood  In Charles Hapgood's book Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, he concludes that ancient land formations gave way to hyperdiffusionism and the diffusion \\"of a true culture.\\" This culture could have been more advanced than that of Egypt or Greece because it was the foundation of a worldwide culture. Hapgood also suggests that the Three-age system of archeology is irrelevant due to primitive cultures co-existing with modern societies.  Grafton Elliot Smith  Heliolithic Culture, as Grafton Elliot Smith refers to it, consists of cultural practices such as megaliths. Similar designs and methods of construction of such pieces have what seem like a linear geographical distribution. These heliolithic cultures can refer to religious customs that share distinctive practices, such as the worship of a Solar Deity. As this trope is seen in numerous belief systems, Smith believes it is diffused from one ancient civilization. Early Man Distribution refers to Smith's implication that Man derived from \\"six well-defined types of mankind,\\" who comprise the sources for Earth's population. The six types of mankind are the Aboriginal Australians, Negros, Mongols, and the Mediterranean, Alpine, and Nordic races. Recently this classification has been labeled as scientific racism.  Barry Fell  Mystery Hill, or America's Stonehenge, is the site which Barry Fell refers to as the primary basis of his hypothesis that ancient Celts once populated New England. Mystery Hill, Fell believes, was a place of worship for the Celts and Phoenician mariners. These ancient mariners, more commonly known as the Druids, are said to have populated Europe at the same time. He hypothesizes that they were the ancient settlers of North America. Also, he believes that what he describes as inscriptions on stone and tablet artifacts from this site are in an ancient language derived from common sources of the Goidelic languages. These three authors describe hyperdiffusionism as the driving force behind the apparent cultural similarities and population distribution among all civilizations. Hapgood's hypothesis states that one specific civilization is responsible for similar cultural practices in all other civilizations. Smith says that religions are proof of hyperdiffusionism, as similar worship ceremonies and symbols recur in geographically separated societies. Also, Smith believes that the Earth's population is made up of six types of humans, who diffused across the Earth's continents by virtue of their skin color. Finally, Fell asserts that ancient mariners, such as Druids and Phoenicians, traveled from Europe and comprised the early population of ancient America.  Carl Whiting Bishop  Carl Whiting Bishop in the 1930s and the 1940s produced a series of articles arguing hyperdiffusionism in explaining the expansion of technology into China. Among the scholars influenced by Bishop were Owen Lattimore, who was intrigued by Bishop's emphasis on geography as a shaping factor in Chinese civilization and his emphasis on field work rather than library research., p. 24  Lost civilizations  A common hyperdiffusionist hypothesis is that the similarities among disparate civilizations were inherited from the civilization of a lost continent, either Atlantis or Lemuria, which has since sunk into the sea. Sometimes Egypt is taken to be an intermediate civilization that inherited its culture from the lost continent and in turn passed it on to other civilizations. According to G. Elliot Smith, Egypt was the source of civilization for Asia, India, China, the Pacific, and eventually America. Book map1  Mayans  According to Hapgood, the pyramids in South America and Mexico may be indicative of cultural practices shared with ancient Egyptian civilization. He theorized that the ancient Maya were strongly influenced by the diffusion of ancient Egyptian social and political cultures, and that they became a civilized culture due to the migration of citizens from Atlantis after that island sank. For example, he says \\"How did the Mayans achieve such precise results...the knowledge may have, of course, been derived by the Babylonians or the Egyptians\\". It is also said that Mayan artifacts resemble those of a classical culture, possibly Greece. This plays into Plato's Account of the ancient battle for Atlantis, which led to the downfall of the civilization.  Religion and mythology  Hapgood finds evidence of ancient Egyptian \\"expression\\" in the writings of Hinduism and Buddhism. He notes that in these writings there are aappear deities that are similar to those worshiped throughout the world. Furthermore, there are myths and creation stories that are said to have a common origin in Egypt. G. Elliot Smith sees Mummification as a prime example of how religious customs prove the diffusion of a single ancient culture. He believes that only an advanced civilization, such as Egypt, could create such a peculiar belief, and that it then spread by way of ancient mariners.  Critiques   Ethnocentrism and racism  Michael Shermer states that using racial taxonomy in order to make abstract assertions of racial superiority is another expression of ethnocentrism. He asks, \\"how can we 'pigeonhole' blacks as permissive or whites as intelligent when such categories...are actually best described as a continuum?\\" Shermer claims that the belief that one race and/or culture is superior to another defeats the purpose of cultural evolution, and that we cannot dismiss evidence of blending inheritance among all cultures. Shermer uses The Bell Curve by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray as an example of pigeonholing; Herrnstein and Murray try to pigeonhole civilizations into racial categories based on flawed measures of intelligence. Alice Beck Kehoe says that diffusionism is a \\"grossly racist ideology\\". Although she agrees that diffusion of culture can occur through contact and trading, she disagrees with the theory that all civilization came from one superior ancient society.  Pseudoarchaeology  Critical thinker and archaeologist Stephen Williams uses the phrase \\"Fantastic Archaeology\\" to describe the archeological theories and discoveries which he defines as \\"fanciful archaeological interpretations\\". These interpretations usually lack artifacts, data, and testable theories to back up the claims made.  Hyperdiffusionism versus Independent Invention  Kehoe explores the \\"independent invention\\" of works and techniques using the example of boats. Ancient peoples could have used their boat technology to make contact with new civilizations and exchange ideas. Moreover, the use of boats is a testable theory, which can be evaluated by recreating voyages in certain kinds of vessels, unlike hyperdiffusionism. Kehoe concludes with the theory of transoceanic contact and makes clear that she is not asserting a specific theory of how and when cultures diffused and blended, but is instead offering a plausible, and testable, example of how civilizational similarities may have arisen without hyperdiffusionism, namely by independent invention and maritime contact. Alexander Goldenweiser in Culture: The Diffusion Controversy stated that there are reasons for believing that culture may arise independently rather than being transmitted. In addition, Goldenweiser insists that behavior is primitive and that cultural similarities may arise simply because they are reflections of adaptive traits that all human beings have evolved. Goldenweiser disagrees with the theory of hyperdiffusionism, stating that \\"culture is not contagious\\" and that the data fails to support the theory.  Methods  Stephen Williams in his chapter \\"Across The Sea They Came\\" introduced a few hyperdiffusionists, their discoveries, and how they \\"tested\\" artifacts, beginning with Harold S. Gladwin who made his \\"fantastic\\" discoveries at an Arizona Pueblo site, Gila Pueblo Archaeological Foundation. Gladwin favored the diffusion theories which later influenced his methodologies for dating the artifacts at the site. This belief led him to ignore the data that was found at the Folsom Site in his chronology as it made his \\"Man descended from Asia into the New World\\" theory impossible. The section continues with Cyclone Covey and Thomas W. Bent, specifically their publications on the Tucson Artifacts and their theory that ancient Romans traveled to Arizona. Williams pokes fun at this theory in his book Fantastic Archaeology, and criticizes the authors for failing to explain exactly how and why these artifacts were found in Arizona, and focusing their attention instead only on the artifacts themselves and their similarities to Roman artificats. Concluding, Williams points out in the chapter how hyperdiffusionists fail to recognize solid archaeological research methods and/or ignore conflicting data and contextual evidence. They are \\"tailoring their finds with any similar chronology or in-depth linguistic analysis that fits into their scenarios\\".

It was founded in November 2011 as a public fraction of the New Anticapitalist Party (NPA), by the main animators of the former \\"B\\" position, which represented 40% of the internal votes in July 2011. GA defines itself as 'eco-socialist'. Within the NPA, the fraction argued in favour of the unity of left anticapitalist and antiliberal movements in France, considering that the formation of the Left Front, composed initially of the French Communist Party, the Left Party (a breakaway from the Socialist Party led by Jean-Luc M√©lenchon) and later a small split from the Revolutionary Communist League (LCR), Gauche unitaire, had created the basis for a realignment of forces to the left of the Socialist Party. Between the end of 2011 and the middle of 2012, many supporters of this fraction within the NPA left the party or ceased to be active within it. In the 2012 presidential election, some members and local groups of GA anticipated the decision to leave the NPA by campaigning for the Left Front's Jean-Luc M√©lenchon. Others campaigned for the NPA's candidate, Philippe Poutou. (M√©lenchon obtained a little over 11% of the vote in the first round, Poutou 1.15%.) In July 2012, GA presented a motion to a national conference of the NPA, which obtained 22% of the votes. It then decided to leave the NPA to join the Left Front (, FdG). A paid-up membership of 558, overwhelmingly ex- members of the NPA and in many cases of the NPA's predecessor, the Revolutionary Communist League, was reported at a February 2013 national delegate meeting. Some individuals are currently members of both the NPA and GA. In areas where the Left Front organises public activities, such as the holding of Citizens' Assemblies, local GA groups play an active part in promoting them; in others, where the Left Front exists mainly as an electoral cartel, the GA sees its role as helping to transform it into a permanent, interventionist organisation with a mass base. In both cases, GA members work to broaden the Left Front through involving activists who are not members of any of the constituent organisations. Within the Left Front, Anticapitalist Left is involved in discussions with other member-organisations with a view to closer collaboration and a possible merger. It declined a merger proposal from the Left Party, preferring to continue discussions with all the member- organisations. However, it accepted an offer to send observers to meetings of the Left Party's National Council. A group of six member-organisations of the Left Front (Gauche Anticapitaliste, Convergences et Alternative, Gauche Unitaire, F√©d√©ration pour une Alternative Sociale et Ecologique, Les Alternatifs, R√©publique et Socialisme) publish a monthly newsletter, Trait d'Union, and will hold a national meeting on June 15, 2013, with a view to an eventual merger. GA has a number of local elected representatives, including two members of the Limousin Regional Council, originally elected (in March 2010) on a joint PCF-PG-NPA ticket. GA is not affiliated to an international organisation, though a few members are active in the Trotskyist Fourth International on an individual basis and others are sympathisers of the International Socialist Tendency. GA is involved in international solidarity campaigns and social forums, and supports the international Boycott, Disinvestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement in solidarity with Palestine. It has helped to popularise the resistance to austerity in Greece, Spain, Portugal and elsewhere and has contacts with the Greek Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) and the Left Bloc in Portugal, amongst other European parties and coalitions. GA publishes press releases and articles on its national website. It does not currently publish a newspaper or review. Following the national launch of a new movement, Ensemble - Mouvement pour une Alternative de Gauche, Ecologique et Solidaires, at a meeting held in Saint-Denis in January‚ÄìFebruary 2015, GA decided to dissolve. Note: Gauche Anticapitaliste is also the name of an unrelated political organisation in Switzerland founded in 2009 and associated with the Trotskyist Fourth International.

Eight naked > servants, with girdles round their waists, and fragrant with perfumes, > presented the gifts which were brought. The presents were a Hermes (i. e. a > man) born without arms, whom I have seen, large snakes, a serpent ten cubits > in length, a river tortoise of three cubits in length, and a partridge > larger than a vulture.

Based on the different ways Strabo and Dio Cassio render the name (Zarmanochegas, Zarmarus), modern scholars attempted at interpreting Strabo's version as a combination of two words carrying additional information (see below under \\"Interpretation of the inscription in regard to religious affiliation\\"), this raising the question of the state of the tomb inscription at different times in the past. The Eleusinian Mysteries (·ºòŒªŒµœÖœÉŒØŒΩŒπŒ± ŒúœÖœÉœÑŒÆœÅŒπŒ±) were initiation ceremonies of pre-historic antiquity focused on immortality and held in honour of Demeter and Persephone based at Eleusis in ancient Greece.

By 1338, the villages of Vester- and √òsterkippinge had grown up on either side of the parish church, which remained on an isolated site in the countryside. In the Middle Ages, the church was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The church was famous for the pilgrims it attracted over the centuries thanks to three reputed miracles. The first miracle was the bleeding Sacrament in 1492. The second was a miraculous altarpiece depicting the Virgin Mary. At the beginning of the 16th century, the Crown had calling rights for the appointment of clergy similar to the English advowson. In 1767, it was sold into private ownership but was soon reacquired by the State until 1868, when it was sold to the citizens of the parish. It gained full independence in 1938. Architecture The nave, culminating in a chancel with a three-sided end, was built of red brick on a sloping plinth in the Early Gothic style c. 1300. The north door, with its pointed arch, and the priest's door are bricked in while the somewhat modified south door is still in use. The porch and tower were added in the Late Gothic period. The west chapel, adjoining the tower, which is no doubt connected with the pilgrimages, was built slightly before the Reformation. The chancel initially had five small pointed windows which have been replaced with more recent round-arched windows. The Baroque spire was renovated in 1911. Its base takes the form of a sturdy dome with an octagonal lantern. The spire proper is tall and thin.\\"Kippinge kirke\\", Nordens kirker, Retrieved 8 December 2012. Interior and fittings The church provides excellent examples of work intricately carved by J√∏rgen Ringnis in the Auricular style. The altarpiece (1633), with a central painting probably by Anthonius Clement, is flanked by the figures of Matthew and Mark. It also presents female figures symbolizing Faith, Hope and Charity and is decorated with angels. The pedestal has two figures of Christ, one at his christening, the other at the Last Supper. The figures of Luke and John stand on either side of the cornice. The elaborately carved octagonal font and canopy are also by Ringnis (1635), the base bearing the figures of the four Evangelists. The double-arched panels present the Annunciation, Christ's birth, the Adoration of the Magi and the Circumcision. The canopy, shaped as an octagonal lantern with arched panels as in the base, bears male and female herms. In the centre, there is a baptismal scene with naked figures. The highly coloured and gilded finish has been restored. The lattice choir screen (1650) consists of nine panels decorated with flowers, herms and symbols of the virtues. The pedestal bears the naked figures of Adam and Eve while the upper cartouche presents Christ bearing the globe. The screen was decorated by Hans Lauridsen in 1680, who also added the six small paintings of a woman in various positions. Ringnis' pulpit (1631) is similar to that in Nakskov Church with figures of the Evangelists and of John the Baptist, Christ and Moses. The coloured decorations and paintings are probably the work of Anthonius Clement. The church has two old crucifixes, one from the 14th century, the other from the 15th century. The old font in the west chapel is of Gotland limestone. Its base is decorated with four heads. Frescos The frescos in the chancel vault are from c. 1300. They were rediscovered under the limewash in 1904 and restored in 1909. The well executed paintings present images principally from Genesis, Chapters 3 and 4, by artists from the Kippinge workshop. In the east panel, Christ flanked by Mary and John the Baptist and two angels can be seen. To the west are frescos of Adam and Eve and the sacrifice of Cain and Abel. The north panel shows the Fratricide and St Michael combating the dragon. The eastern side of the north vault presents the Annunciation adjacent to the Fall.

Theodor Gustav Pauli (usually Gustav Pauli) (2 February 1866, Bremen - 8 July 1938, Munich) was a German art historian and museum director in Bremen and Hamburg. Early life and career Gustav Pauli was the son of Bremen city senator and mayor, Alfred Pauli (1827-1915). He studied art history in Strasbourg, and then in Leipzig under Anton Heinrich Springer. Pauli wrote his thesis on the Renaissance in Bremen and graduated in Leipzig in 1889. He worked as a research assistant in the Kupferstichkabinett, Dresden alongside Max Lehrs from 1889 until 1891. When Springer died in 1891, Pauli applied to study under Jacob Burckhardt in Basel. Burckhardt, upon discovering that Pauli had spent time with the prickly Springer, declared that Springer's former students were \\"unteachable\\", but accepted him anyway.Charles de Tolnay, \\"Erinnerung an Gustav Pauli und an meine Hamburger Jahre\\", Jahrbuch der Hamburger Kunstsammlungen, 19 (1974), pp. 10-12. Bremen In the summer of 1899, Pauli was appointed to the Kunsthalle Bremen. He engaged the gallery with modern German art, including the first monographic (and sadly, posthumous) exhibition of work by Paula Modersohn- Becker in 1908. He also collected a large number of German and French Impressionist works, which today form the core of the Kunsthalle's collection. In 1911, his purchase of Vincent van Gogh's Poppy Field caused a protest, led by Carl Vinnen, a German painter from Worpswede. Pauli's preference for modern works was seen by some, such as the painter, poet and critic Arthur Fitger, as both dissolute and irrelevant. Like his contemporary gallerist Hugo von Tschudi, Pauli collected works of modern painting at a time when it was deeply unattractive to the broader public, and unappreciated by many art critics.Dorothee Hansen, \\"Gustav Pauli\\", Kunsthalle Bremen - Geschichte Hamburg In 1914, Pauli succeeded Alfred Lichtwark as director of the Kunsthalle Hamburg. At Hamburg, he oversaw the opening of the \\"new building\\" in 1919, and used the additional display space afforded by the enlarged gallery to reorganise the hanging of the collection into a chronological format. He also opened a Print Room in the Kunsthalle in 1922, reflecting an interest first sparked in Dresden.J√∂rg Deuter, \\"Theodor Gustav Pauli\\", Neue Deutsche Biografie, 20 (2001), p. 121 (online version) Pauli acquired more modern works, following Lichtwark's lead, including √âdouard Manet's Nana of 1877.The History of the Hamburger Kunsthalle Pauli spoke at the funeral of his friend, the great \\"image historian\\" Aby Warburg, in 1929.Aby M. Warburg zum Ged√§chtnis: Worte zur Beisetzung von Professor Dr. Aby M. Warburg: geboren am 13. Juni 1866, gestorben am 26. Oktober 1929, Darmstadt: Roetherdruck, 1929. A fire in the Glass Palace in Munich in 1931 destroyed many important works which had been borrowed from the Kunsthalle Hamburg collection. A Festschrift was given to Pauli in that year.Gustav Pauli zum 65. Geburtstage am 2. Februar 1931, Hamburg, 1931. In 1933, Pauli signed his name to the Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State. Despite this, with the early stages of the Nazi attack on modern art and Pauli's public friendships with leading Jewish intellectuals, including Erwin Panofsky, he rapidly fell out of favour and was dismissed. His successor, Harald Busch, continued to defend the collection of modern art in the Kunsthalle.The History of the Hamburger Kunsthalle Life post-1933 The Carl Schurz Society sponsored Pauli on a lecture tour of the United States in 1935. His autobiography, Erinnerungen aus sieben Jahrzehnten, was published in 1936.Erinnerungen aus sieben Jahrzehnten. T√ºbingen: Wunderlich Verlag, 1936. On 19 July 1937, the Degenerate Art Exhibition opened in Munich, which encouraged the public denigration of modern art. The important collections of modern art that Pauli had spent years building and defending in Bremen and Hamburg were dismantled. Pauli died in Munich on 8 July 1938.

He became enthusiastic about Protestantism following figures such as Francisco de Paula Ruet and Antonio Vallespinosa and he is said to have been converted in Gibraltar. In a strict Catholic country he was sentenced in Granada to eight years and banned from being a teacher. The sentence was not for being a Protestant but for spreading propaganda that encouraged others (proselitism). Eleven others were acquitted whilst his co-defendant Jos√© Alhama Teva was given nine years. Matamoros and Teva's sentences were eventually commuted to exile. In May 1863 they were attending the Gibraltar Methodist Church.History , Gibraltar Methodist Church, accessed December 2012 Matamoros went to France and finally died in Switzerland.

Established in 1963, the current building opened in 2004 on Hall Boulevard. As of 2012, Margaret Barnes was the director of the library that had a collection of about 230,000 items making 1.5 million loans of those items. History In 1963, the Tigard Junior Women's Club lobbied the city council to start a library in the city that incorporated a few years prior in 1961. The city agreed to establish a library, but did not fund the project. The next year, the Tigard Library opened in downtown on Main Street at the former city hall, but it was operated by volunteers with an initial collection of 1,011 books, most of which had been donated during a door-to-door campaign. During the second year, the city contributed $175 for part-time staffing. From 1976 to 1986 the library occupied a former mattress factory on Main Street. City residents approved a $2.2 million bond in 1984 to build a new library at Tigard's new civic center. In 1986, the library relocated to the building, where it remained until 2004. The civic center and library were dedicated on May 17, 1986. In 1998, the city began the process of looking to build a new library building, as the library had outgrown its approximately building. At that time the library's collection had grown to 104,000 items. However, voters turned down a bond request that year that also would have paid for other city buildings. In May 2002, Tigard voters passed a $13 million bond measure to construct a new library building. The city bought along Fanno Creek in 2003 for the new library, which was located on a former farm with orchards and a farmhouse. The city hoped to restore the two-story farmhouse and open it to the public, but it burned down in August 2003, during construction of the new library. On August 2, 2004, the new library building was opened at 13500 Southwest Hall. The project cost $14.3 million, and included the costs of the land as well as construction on the structure. Part of the grounds of the new library were fenced-off in September 2008 because of arsenic contamination linked to the former orchard on the land. In January 2010, the library started allowing self-service pick-up of books people have reserved. The Tigard Public Library Foundation funded a feasibility study in 2010 to determine whether a second library was needed. In July 2012, city budget cuts forced the library to start closing on Thursdays.

In Nepal, where modern English education began in the 1850s, there is little or no consensus among teachers and practitioners on whether to follow British, American or Indian variants of English, or allow the development of a Nepal-specific variety of English.

He kept detailed diaries throughout his adult life, now in the possession of the Cumbria Archive Service, many of which cover the growth and development of the town of Barrow-in-Furness, then in Lancashire now in Cumbria, England. Together with Sir James Ramsden, Henry Schneider and Josiah T. Smith, and as three-times Mayor of Barrow-in-Furness, he did much to open up the iron and steel industries in Barrow, which grew from a tiny nineteenth century hamlet into the biggest iron and steel centre in the world, and a major ship-building force in just forty years. Early life Edward Wadham was born in 1828 at Frenchay Manor House, near Bristol, the fifth son of ten children of Thomas and Elizabeth Wadham. His father Thomas Wadham (1796-1849) attended Wadham College, Oxford from 1817-1819,The Registers of Wadham College Oxford, 1719-1871, Vol.ii, p.276, by R.B.Gardiner and was High Sheriff of Bristol in 1843, the same year Isambard Kingdom Brunel completed construction of the SS Great Britain in Bristol Harbour. His grandfather, John Wadham (1762-1843) of Frenchay Manor House and Bristol Parade, had been from 1789 a director and co-owner with Henry Rickett of the Phoenix Glassworks at Temple Meads in Bristol, known as Wadham Ricketts & Co, which manufactured Bristol blue glass,Bristol Glass by Cleo Witt, Cyril Weeden and Arlene Palmer Schwind, published in conjunction with City of Bristol Museum & Art Gallery. . and in 1820 was a director of the Bristol Floating Harbour Company.

After his schooling, Edward Wadham was apprenticed to John Thornhill Harrison and worked with him under Isambard Kingdom Brunel on the tunnels of the South Devon Railway Company, later part of the Great Western Railway Company, and on the Alston branch of the Newcastle & Carlisle Railway.ICE application form Career Aged twenty-three, Edward Wadham arrived in Ulverston by the \\"New Times\\" stagecoach on 1 February 1851 as mineral agent to the Duke of Buccleuch. His first action was to install weighing machines at Dalton-in- Furness railway sidings and Ulverston Canal. The move was not popular with the carters of iron ore. A significant conversation occurred on 5 April when he asked Mr Cranke, land agent to the Duke, for an advance on his salary. Cranke offered him an easy mining job, which he was unable to accept for fear of Mr Lumley, the Duke's chief steward. Cranke advised him to write for permission, and on 17 April he wrote to Mr Lumley thanking him for his permission to take up any small engineering job that might come his way. He was soon engaged as mineral agent to William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale and surveying the line of tramways for Harrison Ainslie & Co. Mr Cranke was also consulted about his moving into Lindal Mount with William George Ainslie, son of Montague Ainslie of Grizedale New Hall, grandfather to Jack Ainslie, Liberal MP. They shared a house and rented stables together for some years, and Edward Wadham later married William's sister Mary Elizabeth Ainslie. Wadham remained at Lindal Mount until he moved into Millwood Manor, built for him by the Duke of Buccleuch, in 1862. As a Director of the Furness Railway he later had his own railway siding extended to the bottom of his garden at Millwood Manor. He was elected Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 6 December 1853, and Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 17 December 1866, and was connected with the Institution for sixty of his eighty-five years. In February 1872 following a bad attack of rheumatism he was certified as unfit to work underground, and the work of surveying the pits passed to his employees. Positions held: * Proprietor of the firm of surveyors known at different times as Wadham & Turner, Wadham, Turner & Strongitharm and Wadham & Son. * Mineral agent from 1851 to 1911 to Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch (1806-1884), and William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch (1831-1914). * Surveyor to William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire at Holker Hall. * Surveyor to George Wyndham, 1st Baron Leconfield of Cockermouth Castle. * Mineral agent to the William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale (1787-1872). * Mineral agent to Josslyn Pennington, 5th Baron Muncaster (1834-1917). * Director of Furness Railway from 1885 to 1911 * Director of Richard Thomas & Co and the Lydney Tinplate Co. * Director of Walney Exploration Co and Vivian Diamond Boring Co and Barrow Salt Co * Director of Gillfoot Mining Co * Director of Barrow Steam Cornmill Co until it was wound up in 1884 * Manager of Longlands Mines * Chairman of North Lonsdale Iron & Steel Co until he resigned in 1899 * Director of Barrow Hematite Steel Company Politics Wadham was a staunch member of the Conservative and Unionist party. He served on Barrow council from its inception in 1867 until 1906 and served as Mayor of Barrow-in-Furness for 3 terms from 1878 to 1881. He was active in the 1885 United Kingdom general election on behalf of his brother- in-law William George Ainslie who was elected as the first Member of Parliament for the new constituency of North Lonsdale, a seat he held until 1892, and of Sir Charles Cayzer in the 1892 United Kingdom general election when he was elected for Barrow-in-Furness, a seat he held until 1906. On 26 April 1904, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Lancashire. Wife and children He married Mary Elizabeth Ainslie, daughter of Montague Ainslie on 20 September 1860, and at one point owned a steamship called the 'Mary Elizabeth Wadham'. They had 6 children: * Amy, born in 1861, died in 1944 * Arthur Edward Montague, born 1863, married Marguerite Josephine Bridson (Greta) in 1900, and became County Councillor for Cockermouth. He died in 1925 * Walter Francis Ainslie DL, JP was born in 1865 and joined his father as a civil and mining engineer in 1887. Educated at Charterhouse School and Pembroke College, Cambridge he continued to live at Millwood Manor, and like his father, was Mineral Agent to the Duke of Buccleuch (from 1913-1945), a Magistrate, and became Mayor of Barrow-in-Furness.

Edward Wadham was sworn in as a Magistrate in 1869 and served until 1908. He was vice president of North Lonsdale Agricultural Society in 1869, and also held the posts of president and secretary. He practiced farming on a small scale and Mrs Wadham carried off prizes for honey and for butter. Wadham enjoyed sailing, cricket, hunting (including otter hunting) and fishing, but most particularly shooting. Amongst other places, he shot on Barrow Island and at the estate of Robert Hannay at Ornockenoch. By his own account he shot rabbit, pheasant, black game, rooks, seagulls, a finger and thumb from his left hand, a coachman and a passer-by.

It was a separate municipality, but became administratively a part of Cieszyn in 1973. It lies in the Silesian Foothills and in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The name was at first scribed in Latin (Pulcra villa, 1284), then in German (Schondorf, 1439) and later in Czech (Krasney Wsy, 1457; Krasna Wes, 1523), eventually the noun Wes (a village) was dropped. The name is of topographic-cultural origins and literally means a beautiful [village] (nominative archaic Polish krasny and Czech kr√°sn√Ω).  History  Archaeological traces of the first farmers in the area from Lengyel culture (4th millennia BC) have been found in the village. It was first mentioned in a written document in 1284 as Pulcra villa. Since 1290 it belonged to the then formed in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland Duchy of Teschen that was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1610 it was given by Adam Wenceslaus to reestablished Dominican Abbey in Cieszyn as a recompense for their lost gardens. At the beginning of 20th century two cemetery chapels were built: a Catholic and a Lutheran. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn.

It is based on the Chinese legend The Butterfly Lovers, which follows the doomed love between a rich girl and a commoner boy. The film was a commercial success, inspiring The Teng Chun to direct several further films based on Chinese mythology. The name derives from the given names of the legend's two main characters, Liang Shanbo (Nio Sam Pek) () and Zhu Yingtai (Giok Eng Tay) (). Plot Giok Eng Tay, the daughter of a rich man, falls in love with Nio Sam Pek, the son of a commoner. To ensure their family's well being, Eng Tay's father insists that she marry Ma Bun Cai (Ma Wencai ()), the son of a regent. To ensure that this wish is fulfilled, Eng Tay is locked in her room while her father sends men to attack Sam Pek, who later dies of his wounds. After her marriage is arranged, Giok Eng Tay and her procession pass by Sam Pek's grave. A rain storm suddenly develops and Sam Pek's grave splits open; Eng Tay, wanting to be with her lover, runs to the grave and throws herself into it. The grave then closes and the storm dissipates. Production Sam Pek Eng Tay was directed and produced by The Teng Chun, the son of a Chinese-Indonesian merchant who had studied film in Los Angeles, US. He had made his directorial debut shortly before producing Sam Pek Eng Tay, with Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Cikembang). This film, a moderate success, gave him enough funds to improve his camera equipment: Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang had been criticised for its poor sound. However, unlike the earlier film ‚Äì which was based on a best- selling novel by Kwee Tek Hoay ‚Äì Sam Pek Eng Tay was based on a Chinese legend, that of The Butterfly Lovers which was popular as a stage play at the time. The story was adapted for a Dutch East Indies setting. The film's cast is unrecorded. Release and reception Sam Pek Eng Tay was released in 1931 by The Teng Chun's Cino Motion Picture to commercial success, mostly targeting ethnic Chinese audiences. The Teng Chun would go on to release numerous films based on Chinese legends, including Pat Bie To (Eight Beautiful Women; 1932), Pat Kiam Hiap (Eight Swordsmen; 1933), and Ouw Peh Tjoa (White and Black Snake; 1934). These later films, emphasising silat, were generally profitable, and allowed The Teng Chun to dominate the industry until after the release of Albert Balink's Terang Boelan (Full Moon) in 1937. The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

The Park Lane student community consists of 500+ students, representing more than 40 nationalities. The home to foreign student ratio is 54% to 46%. The EYFS, Primary and Secondary campuses currently cater for children from Pre-Nursery (aged 2-3) to Year 12 (aged 16-17). Following its IB World School accreditation in February 2018, Park Lane has recently expanded to accommodate pupils (aged 16‚Äì18), who study the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme at the senior school branch at the Klarov branch of the Prague 1 campus. Although classified as a British international school, because of its location in the Czech Republic, Park Lane also offers an intensive Czech programme for all pupils. This programme ensures that Park Lane‚Äôs students pass their annual Czech state examinations as required by the Czech law.  History  Park Lane International School officially opened in September 2006. Within 7 years it had grown into a full- scale Primary school with 180 pupils on roll. In 2013, the Secondary school campus at Valdstejnska was opened. The senior school branch, located at Klarov, first welcomed students in the 2017/2018 academic year. The school caters for 550 students from the EYFS through to the Secondary school.  Locations  Park Lane International School opened its first campus at Prague 5 Bertramka accommodating children aged from 2 to 6 years. The Prague 5 Bertramka campus, being a home to the Early Years Foundation Stage, is located in a spacious villa with its own garden. The School‚Äôs primary campus has its headquarters in a building called Norbertinum at Prague 6. Norbertinum, which originally served as a kindergarten, was built by the church in 1904. The school is located in St≈ôe≈°ovice, a quiet neighbourhood featuring many villas, some of which were designed in the functionalist style by renowned Czech architects. Another part of the Stresovice-Prague 6 campus, located within walking distance from Norbertov, is the Sibeliova branch, a spacious villa with a purposely designed garden that is a home to the Early Years Foundation Stage. The Prague 6 St≈ôe≈°ovice campus accommodates children from Nursery to Year 5. Even though the Norbertov and Sibeliova sites at Prague 6 are located a short distance from the city centre, both are easily accessible by public transport with tram and bus stops nearby. The Secondary school, which opened in September 2013, is situated in the historic district of Mal√° Strana in a palatial building situated directly alongside the walls of Prague Castle and extremely close to Malostranska metro station and a major tram stop which serves several different routes. Surrounded by its own walled gardens and terraces in a plot measuring 3000m2, the building - which was used as an embassy for several decades - is in exemplary condition having recently undergone a full refurbishment. The latest addition to the Prague 1 campus, located a short walk away from the Prague 1 Valdstejnska building, is the Klarov branch, which caters to students in the final four years of secondary school and is a registered location for Cambridge IGCSE and IB Diploma examinations. Although all campuses are situated close to public transport stops, younger children have the option of travelling to and from the school and between campuses using school buses.  Curriculum  The school follows the National Curriculum of England and offers a British education to children from pre-nursery to university entrance, taught by UK qualified native speakers, plus British trained foreign teachers and local teachers. Pupils at Park Lane International School prepare for KS2 National Tests and, at the secondary level, will sit for Cambridge IGCSE examinations, followed by the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP), which is widely accepted by universities worldwide.

(1758-27 February 1840) was a French Sulpician priest who emigrated from France at the time of the Revolution. From 1810 to 1829 he was the Provincial Superior of the Sulpician congregation in the United States. He served as vicar-general to the Roman Catholic Bishops of Baltimore, and for a time oversaw both St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore and Mount St. Mary's College and Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland. Life St. Mary's Seminary Jean-Marie Tessier was born in 1758 in Chapelle-Blanche, France. Tessier had taught theology for two years at Viviers when, on April 8, 1791 John Tessier sailed for America from St. Malo, France in company with Francis Nagot S.S., Michael Levadoux, and A. Ganier, together with several seminarians. Given the threatening aspect of affairs in France, Rev. J. A. Emery, Superior-General of the Sulpicians, deemed it prudent to found a house of their institute in some foreign country, and at the suggestion of Cardinal Antonio Dugnani, nuncio at Paris, the United States was chosen. Negotiations were opened with the recently consecrated Bishop John Carroll of Baltimore, Maryland, and after some delay Rev. Nagot was named first director of a projected seminary, with Levadoux as treasurer.Jones, Arthur. \\"Michael Levadoux.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9.

They first lodged at 94 Baltimore Street but soon purchased the One Mile Tavern on the edge of the city, dedicated the house to the Blessed Virgin, and in October opened classes with five students whom they had brought from France.

Tessier taught theology at the Seminary and in 1810, succeeded Francis Nagot as superior of the Sulpician community in the United States, a position he held until 1829.

From this ultimately led to the foundation of the religious community of the Oblate Sisters of Providence. Tessier died 27 February 1840 at the age of eighty-two.

Crockett is a log-built Chesapeake Bay deck boat built in 1924 An oyster buy-boat, also known as deck boat, is an approximately 40‚Äì90 foot long wooden boat with a large open deck which serviced oyster tongers and dredgers. Similar in function to sardine carriers, buy boats circulated among the harvesters collecting their catches, then delivered their loads to a wholesaler or oyster processing house. This spared the fishermen the task and its downtime, allowing them to catch more oysters. Buy-boats also bought seed oysters, or spat, for planting in oyster beds. History Rise Some Chesapeake Bay buyboats such as the William B. Tennison began their lives as sailing vessels that were converted for power when internal combustion engines became available. Most buyboats, however, including those built for power, retained a single sail into the 1930s when engines became more powerful and reliable. Most Chesapeake Bay buyboats had plank-on-frame hulls like the Nellie Crockett, but a few were built as log canoes, such as the F.D. Crockett, a rare surviving example of this type. Buy-boats had a rear-mounted deck house over the engine that contained the wheel house that typically had a rounded front with three to five windows, a galley, a head, and bunks for the crew. Some boats also had additional bunks up in the fore-peak for crew members. Buy-boats saw their heyday in the first half of the 20th century when most oysters from the Chesapeake Bay were harvested by tongers in small flat bottomed row boats (who used long tongs to pull oysters from the bottom), or dredged by sail powered skipjacks. Interstate highways, bridges and tunnels such as the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel, and smaller bridges that span the many tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay were non-existent prior to the 1950s, therefore it was much faster to haul seafood to market by boat than by truck. Many buyboat captains also used their vessels to transport freight such as fresh produce, grain, livestock, and lumber to market during the off-season from May to August when they were not buying oysters. During World War II At the start of World War II German U-boats were wreaking havoc in the shipping lanes just off the Virginia Capes. Desperate to stop these losses, and lacking enough vessels to patrol the coast, the US government commissioned a number of Chesapeake Bay buy-boats for wartime service as patrol vessels to hunt for U-boats just offshore. These patrol boats were lightly armed with machine guns and were usually manned by their former owners and crew who were mustered into the service to operate them for the government. One of these boats blew up while docked at Cape Charles killing some of its crew. The explosion was believed by many locals to have been the work of German saboteurs, possibly put ashore by a passing U-Boat, who were believed to be in the area but this was never proven. When the war ended, the boats were returned to their former owners. Decline of the oyster industry Only a few buyboats were built after World War II. This was due to vast improvements to transportation infrastructure in the region during the 1950s when most water-borne commerce moved to highways, and the rapid decline of the Chesapeake Bay oyster industry due to decades of over-harvesting and oyster diseases Haplosporidium nelsoni (MSX) and dermo that decimated the bay's oyster population. By the mid-1980s buyboats had all but vanished from the Chesapeake Bay. Today most oysters harvested from the Chesapeake are hybrid triploids raised in cages in aquaculture operations. Most dredgers who still harvest native oysters bring their catch directly to the docks themselves and seafood is hauled to distant markets in refrigerated trucks. Buyboats in the 21st century By 2013 only one buyboat, the Devlin K,The Last Chesapeake Bay Buyboat in Virginia, the Delvin K - richmond.com operating out of remote Tangier Island, Virginia, was still buying oysters on the Chesapeake Bay, but many of these sturdy but largely obsolete wooden vessels remain afloat.Photos and Information on the Northern & Southern Oyster Buyboats Still in the Chesapeake Bay & South, oysterbuyboats.com Some were used to dredge crabs into the 1980s, but have since been replaced by smaller Chesapeake Bay deadrise workboats in this role. A few of them were adapted for use in the Chesapeake Bay Menhaden fishery during the 1970s and 80s but have since been retired, and some were used to haul seed oysters to replenish oyster reefs in Virginia and Maryland into the early 2000s. The few boats of this type that are still being operated as commercial fishing vessels in the 21st century are mainly used in the Chesapeake Bay pound net, fishery. Most of the vessels of this type that are still afloat have found completely new lives as museum pieces, yachts, floating classrooms, and dive charter boats, a few in places far from the Chesapeake Bay such as the Florida Keys, the Bahamas, and Belize.

Font Farran was instrumental in founding the Catalan left-wing party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), but shifted to the Spanish left-wing POUM party on the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. He was imprisoned in 1937 and fled to France at the end of the war. He became active in French as well as Spanish left-wing politics and was a member of the Fourth International. He wrote a Marxist history of Spain, a history of Catalan nationalism, and a book of memoirs. 1928-1931 In 1928, Rafael Font Farran was the editor and founder of a student magazine in Barcelona, L‚ÄôEstudiant. After its fourth issue, this magazine was banned by Miguel Primo de Rivera‚Äôs dictatorship, to which it was opposed. In 1929, Font Farran, one of the leaders of the opposition to this dictatorship in University of Barcelona, was one of the founders of a student left-wing organization, Esquerra Universit√†ria. He was also a founding member of a catalanist youth organization, Palestra, in April 1930. In May 1930, he joined Estat Catal√†, Francesc Macia i Llussa‚Äôs political party. In August 1930, he published his first book, Paraules de Joventut, a political essay. He was the youngest speaker at the Conference of the Catalan left-wing parties, which, in Barcelona from 17 to 19 March 1931, gave rise to the Catalan political party ERC (Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya), of which Font Farran was a founder. Immediately after the proclamation of the \\"Catalan Republic\\" by Maci√†, president of the ERC, Font Farran participated, in the night of 14 April 1931, in the defense of the headquarters of the Catalan Government in Barcelona, because the ERC feared that the building could be attacked by Spanish troops. A few weeks later, Font Farran joined the Barcelona daily newspaper L‚ÄôOpini√≥, the central organ of the ERC, in which he was responsible for international news. 1932-1933 In the spring of 1932, there was a long controversy between Font Farran and Joan Peir√≥ Belis, editor of Solidaridad Obrera - daily newspaper of the anarcho-syndicalist confederation CNT - with three articles written by Font Farran in L'Opini√≥ and four articles by Peir√≥ in Solidaridad Obrera. During the summer of 1932, in Madrid, Font Farran was private secretary to the member of the Parliament of Spain Llu√≠s Companys i Jover, one of the leaders of the ERC and future president of Catalonia. At the beginning of 1933, Font Farran was one of the leaders of a project of a new youth organization, \\"Joventut Esquerrista\\", inside ERC.Ivern Salva 1988, pages 318 and 323 In October 1933, he was one of the founders of the PNRE, a Catalan political party born out of a split with the ERC, and also one of the founders of the \\"Provisional Committee\\" of the youth organization of the PNRE.Ivern Salva 1988, pages 327, 427 and 428 This project aimed to set up a new youth organization in rivalry with the JEREC (Joventuts de Esquerra Republicana Estat Catal√†), which Font Farran considered to be fascistic, but the directors of the ERC decided that the JEREC would continue to be the only youth organization of the party. In December 1933, after the victory of the Spanish right-wing parties in the legislative election in November 1933, Font Farran published a new political essay, La crisi de les esquerres, in which he called upon the disunited Catalan left-wing parties to recover their ‚Äúcohesion‚Äù. 1934-1936 During the catalanist uprising on 6 October 1934, Font Farran participated again, as in 1931, in the defense of the headquarters of the Catalan Government in Barcelona, which the Spanish troops seized in the morning of 7 October. Font Farran was arrested and imprisoned, but he was finally discharged. After the victory of the Spanish left-wing parties in the legislative election in February 1936, he was recruited by the Catalan Government for its CGOP, Catalan police headquarters, in which Font Farran was responsible for the censorship of foreign publications distributed in Catalonia, because as Font Farran explained the Catalan Government did not want to ‚Äúalarm\\" public opinion about rumors of a military coup against the Spanish Republic. Shortly after the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, Font Farran resigned from the CGOP and joined the left-wing and anti- Stalinist party POUM and its daily newspaper La Batalla. During the Spanish Civil War, Font Farran worked as a journalist for La Batalla, central organ of the POUM. In his book Homage to Catalonia, George Orwell, author of 1984, says he read La Batalla at the time when he fought in the ranks of the POUM. 1937-1939 On 16 June 1937, Andreu Nin i P√©rez, leader of the POUM, was arrested by Catalan police, which was in those days at the beck and call of Stalin‚Äôs representatives. Font Farran as Nin‚Äôs counsel went to the CGOP to ask after Nin. In the CGOP, he was almost arrested, but managed to escape. Some time later, as a counsel for Nin‚Äôs wife, Olga Pavlova Taareva, Font Farran lodged at Barcelona court-house a complaint which, he said, raised the possibility of an arbitrary arrest \\"or a kidnapping‚Äù. Later, in the summer of 1937, he opened in Barcelona a law firm for the defense of the imprisoned POUMist militants, and rented offices for it in his name. These offices were used by the POUM, which was prohibited and underground. In October 1937, Font Farran was arrested in Barcelona while distributing a POUM leaflet protesting against the death of a POUMist militant. He was incarcerated in the Modelo prison of Barcelona in the \\"second gallery,\\" where POUMist prisoners were gathered together. He was elected \\"president\\" of this second gallery. In this gallery, where many POUMist militants, Spanish or foreigners, were imprisoned, Orwell would probably have been imprisoned too if he had not escaped from an arrest in Barcelona. But some time later, Font Farran was transferred to a convict prison, a hundred kilometers from Barcelona, the \\"labor camp No. 3\\", in the village of Els Omells de na Gaia. Subsequently, he was tried in Barcelona by the \\"Special Court of espionage and high treason\\" of Catalonia, which sentenced him to six years in prison because of his membership of the POUM. In January 1939, with other prisoners evacuated from the Modelo prison of Barcelona, he fled to Northern Catalonia at the end of the Spanish civil war. In Catalonia under French administration, he was imprisoned in the camp of Saint-Cyprien, but he escaped a few days after his arrival. He then lived in Belgium for about a year. The 1940s Following the German offensive in May 1940, he was transferred, with other exiles in Belgium, to the camp of Gurs, in South West of France, where, again, he was able to escape after a few weeks. Shortly after, in Paris, he joined the French Resistance against the German occupying forces, in the ranks of PCI (Parti Communiste Internationaliste). In 1943, he left this party - renamed meantime CCI (Comit√© communiste Internationaliste pour la Quatri√®me Internationale), of whose central committee he was a member - and he joined the POI (Parti ouvrier internationaliste), the French section of the Fourth International. Within the POI, he was one of the leaders of the GTE, which gathered together the Spanish members of the Fourth International. From 1943 on, he was the representative of Spain in the European Secretariat of the Fourth International.Prager 1981, page 116Alexander 1991 page 298 As a member of this European Secretariat, he was one of the main organizers of the difficult merger of the POI and the CCI in March 1944. He was also one of the Spanish delegates, with Eduardo Mauricio Ortiz, at the European Conference of the Fourth International in February 1944 in Picardy, and at the Second International Conference of the Fourth International in Paris in March 1946.Prager 1981, pages 190, 357)Alexander 1991, pages 301, 305 Second half of the twentieth century In 1951, he disagreed with the strategy of entryism launched by the Fourth International and he worked for several years on a project to form an anti-Stalinist Spanish communist party, in association with the former Stalinist leader Jos√© del Barrio Navarro and with the financial support of Tito's Yugoslavia. A few years later, he re-joined the POUM and, in the spring of 1961, he became a member of its Executive Committee. But in 1962 he disagreed with the party line and resigned from this Executive Committee and finally left the POUM. The following year, after twenty-four years of exile, he returned to Spain, where he began to publish articles in the weekly magazines Tele/Estel and L‚ÄôEco de Sitges. In 1956, he was recruited by the Agence France Presse, where, until his retirement in 1977, he worked as a journalist on the Spanish-language editorial staff, in Paris. Font Farran wrote his memoirs under the title Anys agitats (\\"Stirring Years\\"). His eldest son, Rafael Font Vaillant, published in 2014 a biography of his father.Font Vaillant, 2014  Works  *Paraules de Joventut, Edicions Ariel, 1930. *La crisi de les esquerres, Llibreria Catal√≤nia, 1933.

The musalsalat are similar in style to Latin American telenovelas. They are often historical epics about Islamic figures or love stories involving class conflict and intrigue. The word musalsal literally means \\"chained, continuous\\". During the evenings of the month of Ramadan, after the Iftar meal is eaten to break the day's fast, families across much of the Arab world watch these special dramas on television. Arab satellite channels broadcast the programs each night, drawing families who have gathered to break their fast. Most musalselat are bundled into about 30 episodes, or about one episode for each night of Ramadan. These television series are an integral part of the Ramadan tradition, the same way the hakawati, the storyteller who recounted tales and myths, was part of Ramadan nights in the past. According to the market research firm Ipsos, during the first two weeks of Ramadan 2011 television figures rose across the Middle East by 30%, and as many as 100 Arab soap operas and shows broadcast on state and private channels. The Ramadan season has been compared to a month-long Super Bowl for its importance in the Arab world's television market. During this period, television ratings remain high well into the night, and the cost of a 30-second advertisement during peak Ramadan viewing hours can be more than double the normal rate. According to the Pan Arab Research Center, the amount spent in 2012 for Ramadan television advertising exceeded a forecast of US$420 million, out of an estimated $1.98 billion for the total Arab television advertising market for the same year. In 2012, YouTube has announced a new online channel specifically dedicated to showing Ramadan shows. Egypt  Ramadan and Egyptian TV Dramas  In Egypt, musalsalat are designed to air for the first time during Ramadan, and to last for the entire month.Dawoud, A. (2013). Chapter 9: Egyptian Audiences of Musalsalat in the Eye of the Beholder. In R. Butsch & S. Livingstone, Meanings of Audiences: Comparative Discourses (pp. 123-134). London: Routledge. As a result, television stations wind up rerunning musalsalat throughout the year, as barely any other musalsalat are produced. As such, Egyptian TV Dramas play a major role in Egyptian society, in that it heavily shapes and influences the culture, by curating both religious and modern content.Keenan, K., & Yeni, S. (2003). Ramadan Advertising in Egypt: A Content Analysis With Elaboration on Select Items. Journal Of Media And Religion, 2(2), 109-117. http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15328415jmr0202_04 This mixture of conservative thinking with contemporary business approaches proves controversial to critics. On the one hand, the content of programs does not align with the religious tone of Ramadan. Critics argues that the commercialization of Ramadan turned the holy month into \\"a month of self-denial\\" ‚Äì where audiences are not spiritually in touch with God ‚Äì rather than a month of self-awareness and deep reflection. On the other hand, the commercialization of Ramadan and TV programming is seen to be a natural process as Egyptians are increasingly adopting more Westernized lifestyles due to Egypt's developing economy. Because the Ramadan lifestyle guarantees the penetration of a large audience, prominent advertisers produce specific campaigns to air for the first time, despite the doubled advertising rates during that period. Additionally, the ads are seen to promote consumption, which goes against the spirit of Ramadan: which is to share and to be charitable. The commercials usually provide unattainable or unrealistic dreams for the urban and rural poor.Abu-Lughod, L. (2008). Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.  History of Egyptian TV Programming  Television programming has continuously shaped the Egyptian national identity and the role of audiences. In the 1960s and 1970s, Egyptian TV programming was largely tied to the nationalist and developmentalist agenda of the government under President Nasser. Beginning the 1990s, TV programming witnessed a shift from developmentalist values ‚Äì including social welfare and national progress ‚Äì to capitalist values. The discourse of national development was challenged by globalization as the Egyptian government began to espouse privatization and market reform. Private corporations began to provide funds for the production of serials and advertisements, including but not limited to the salaries of stars, extravagant sets, props, and location shoots. Competition between brands was encouraged and thus, commercials began gaining larger time slots on television that that granted to serials. Instead of treating audiences as \\"citizens\\", Egyptian media began to treat audiences as \\"consumers\\". Today, there are two ways through which consumerism relates to Egyptian melodramas: the first being the fascination with and admiration of actors and actresses ‚Äì referred to as \\"stars\\" by viewers; and the second being television commercials. In 2012, Egyptian television channels had more than 50 soap operas on offer, for a combined production cost estimated at a record 1.18 billion Egyptian pounds.  Egyptian Musalsalat: A Social Construction of Reality  Egyptian serials are well placed at the heart of Egyptian society, examining all areas of the society.Abou Zeid, D. (2016). The Portrayal of Happiness in Egyptian TV Series. Global Media Journal (Malaysian Edition), 6(1). They tackle prevalent social and political issues ‚Äì such as corruption and oppression ‚Äì, in a way that allows individuals and families to relate to the events or characters of the musalsal. In their crafting of being relatable, but also distant, drama serials serve as a medium to spread information among and to educate the masses.Auter, P., Agnihotri, I., Red, M., Sharif, J., & Roy, F. (2010). Effects of Viewing Drama on Egyptian and American Youths' Perceptions of Family. Journal Of Middle East Media, 6(1), 1-24. They allow for the construction of a multifaceted understanding of the current social reality. They invite the audience to evaluate current issues, from different viewpoints, as they can relate to certain aspects, while also being entertained, as the serials provide a certain distance between viewers and actors. That being said, television serials have a social responsibility, especially in a developing country, to teach its viewers on the different ways one can achieve happiness. = Common Themes = Egyptian soap operas usually follow a main character as he or she struggles to gain recognition and his or her position in society. As such, excessive consumption and desire for money at any cost are themes that appear in storylines, usually leading characters to engage in illegal and corrupt practices, such as bribery, embezzlement, and drug dealing. Storylines typically emphasize the vulnerability of the younger generation to obtaining financial security through marriage, engaging in illegal or demeaning work, or turning to drug dealing and addictive consumption. In these cases, serials serve as tools to teach Egyptian society of the financial burden the youth carries. Another representation in relation to money that has dominated in Egyptian cinema and television drama is marking the contrast between rich and poor, often portrayed as corrupt versus noble. Egyptian television programming provides a paradox between attempting to teach society of the realities of gaining money through immoral and illegal means, while constantly being exposed, and subjected to luxurious and extravagant lifestyles. = International Recognition = In 15 March 2018, Netflix added the first Egyptian series Grand Hotel under the name \\"Secret of the Nile\\", with English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish subtitles. It is also the first Arabic series released on the online streaming service. Produced by Egypt's CBC, the TV series is an Egyptian equivalent of the Spanish drama television series \\"Gran Hotel\\" and was aired during Ramadan 2016 . Kuwait Kuwait's television drama industry tops other Gulf drama industries and produces a minimum of fifteen serials annually. Kuwait is the production center of the Gulf television drama and comedy scene. Most Gulf television drama and comedy productions are filmed in Kuwait. Kuwaiti soap operas are the most-watched soap operas in the Gulf region. Soap operas are most popular during the time of Ramadan, when families gather to break their fast. Although usually performed in the Kuwaiti dialect, they have been shown with success as far away as Tunisia. Lebanon Lebanese drama series lag significantly behind the more popular Syrian or Egyptian production, a lack of popularity thought to be caused primarily by weak scripts. Lebanese television tends to focus on reality television, shows with interviewing/talks shows, comedy, and so on rather than soap operas. Lebanese series also face challenges because of low budgets and an absence of government support. Because of the war in Syria, some Syrian production companies have relocated their projects to Lebanon. Syria Film set of the series Unshoodat Al Matar Syrian soap operas took off in the 1990s, when satellite-television access increased across the Arab world, and were watched by tens of millions of people from Morocco to the Persian Gulf. As a consequence of the Syrian Civil War, Syrian production companies have shelved new shows and viewers throughout the Arab world have called for a boycott of Syrian satellite channels. A tax break issued by the government has failed to revive the industry. In 2010, some 30 Syrian soaps were aired during Ramadan, some only in Syria, but most on pan-Arab satellite channels. Syrian series have become one of the country's most prized exports, and are very popular in the Persian Gulf countries. Following the onset of the 2011 Syrian uprising, some have called for a boycott of Syrian musalselat. Many Syrian actors, producers and directors left the country; many film sets have been destroyed or made inaccessible by the fighting. By 2014 only 20 Syrian series were being made, compared to the 40 produced in 2010. * List of Syrian television series Jordan Jordan produces a number of \\"Bedouin Soap Operas\\" that are filmed outdoors with authentic props. The actors use Bedouin-accented Arabic to make the story feel more authentic. These musalsalat have become popular in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. In musalsalat that center around traditional village life during the time period just before World War II. Oftentimes, these dramas are permeated by themes of tension between the traditional and modern ways of life with specific emphasis on the patriarchal systems and the role of women within them. Unique to this particular type of musalsal is the willingness of the shows' creators to confront sensitive issues such as honor killing. Another musalsal genre is that of the historical drama. Topics of these shows range from pre-Islamic poets to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Many of these are joint productions by Jordanian, Syrian, and Persian Gulf region television producers. According to a survey of Jordan's television viewers, 92.5% prefer watching Syrian dramas while 61.6% prefer Egyptian ones. This is compared to 26.6% who prefer watching Jordanian drama series. While the aforementioned musalsalat target a broader, Arabic-speaking audience, certain programs target Jordanians specifically. These shows tend to deal with social and political issues particular to present-day Amman. Acting in these programs, as well as Jordanian musalsalat in general, is often lauded as being superior to that of many Egyptian-produced soap operas.Shoup, John A. \\"Literature and Media.\\" Culture and Customs of Jordan.

Without the help of a master, he had made some progress in the art, when he went to Italy, where he studied some years. At Bologna he became acquainted with Guido Reni, who made him a present of his portrait, painted by himself. On his return to France he settled in Paris, where he painted the portrait of Louis XIV as Dauphin, and many other distinguished personages, so much to the satisfaction of the court, that he looked forward with confidence to the acquisition of fortune and fame.

It is based on an earlier story by the author, \\"Hector Servadac, fils\\", which was part of The Mammoth Book of Jules Verne Adventures. It is a reworking of Off on a Comet, an 1877 novel by Jules Verne. The hardcover edition of the novel is included in a slipcase with a hardcover edition of Off on a Comet. Plot summary As in Verne's novel, the main character is Hector Servadac, however, instead of being stranded on the comet while serving in the French Algerian army, his father is a supporter of a doomsday cult and Servadac is stranded on a splinter of the shattered Earth when the planet is destroyed by a comet. Roberts described the central metaphor as \\"the trope that the world might end and that we might not even be sure it has happened. We surely wouldn't be wholly oblivious (this is the end of the world we're talking about, after all!) But we might not be wholly certain, either. There would be a lengthy transition period during which we would become increasingly convinced that something substantial had changed in our lives.\\" Reception In the SF Encyclopedia, John Clute described Splinter as an \\"enjoyable homage to and gloss upon the Verne novel.\\" References External links *The Author's Website Category:2007 British novels Category:2007 science fiction novels Category:British science fiction novels Category:Works by Adam Roberts (British writer) Category:Adaptations of works by Jules Verne Category:Impact event novels Category:Fictional comets ","title":"Splinter (novel)"},{"id":"37898186","text":"Lamar Delmarro Nelson is a Jamaican footballer who plays for Arnett Gardens F.C. in the top-flight Jamaica National Premier League.

He qualified for the men's lightweight category at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, by finishing fourth from the Pan American Weightlifting Championships in Callao, Peru. He also achieved two top-ten finishes at the Junior World Championships in 2006 and in 2007. Luna-Grenier started his sporting career at the age of thirteen, when he was discovered at a summer day camp by Mario Parente, a certified national Olympic weightlifter from the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and a coach, who quickly shaped him into an elite athlete. Two years later, Luna-Grenier became a Canadian senior national champion, and aimed to become the nation's first weightlifter to capture an Olympic gold medal, when he was featured as The Gazette's Amateur Athlete of the Week. In 2006, Luna-Grenier, however, was devastated upon the death of his coach Parente from an apparent heart attack, but had forged on with the guidance of Andre Kulesza, who administered and worked as the head coach for Club d'Halt√©rophilie de Montr√©al. Despite of his former coach's sudden loss, Luna-Grenier had captured numerous sporting successes, including his seventh-place finish at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia, and top-ten finishes from the Junior World Championships. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Luna-Grenier successfully lifted 131 kg in the single-motion snatch, and hoisted 172 kg more in the two-part, shoulder-to-overhead clean and jerk, to combine a total of 293 kg, finishing in seventeenth place. His sporting effort tied him with Sri Lanka's Chinthana Vidanage, who ranked atop the group for weighing seven hundredths of a kilogram less than his weight.
