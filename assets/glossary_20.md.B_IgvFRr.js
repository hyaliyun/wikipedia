He is widely known for his uninhibited, sculptural beach houses in the coastal regions of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut during the 1950s and '60s, as well as for his indirect role in the 1959 Kitchen Debate between Richard Nixon (then Vice President) and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, which began at an exhibit Geller had helped design for the American National Exhibition in Moscow. Geller worked with the prominent firm of American industrial and graphic designer Raymond Loewy where his projects ranged widely‚Äîfrom the design of shopping centers and department stores across the United States, to the Windows on the World restaurant atop the World Trade Center and the logo of New York-based department store Lord & Taylor. After designing a beach house for Loewy's director of public relations, Geller was featured in The New York Times and began receiving notoriety for his own work. Between 1955 and 1974, Geller produced a series of modest but distinctive vacation homes, many published in popular magazines including Life, Sports Illustrated, and Esquire. On his death in 2011, The New York Times said Geller \\"helped bring modernism to the masses.\\" Background Geller was born in Brooklyn on April 17, 1924, to Olga and Joseph Geller, an artist and sign painter who had emigrated from Hungary in 1905. Architectural historian Alastair Gordon reported that as a sign painter Joseph Geller designed the logo for Boar's Head Provision Company, still in use today. Geller studied drawing with his father, and the attended art classes at the Brooklyn Museum. A 1938 painted self-portrait won him a scholarship to the New York High School of Art and Music (1939), and he subsequently studied architecture at Cooper Union, where he took drawing class with Robert Gwathmey, father of architect Charles Gwathmey. Geller later worked as a naval architect for the United States Maritime Commission designing tanker hulls and interiors (1939‚Äì42). During World War II, Geller served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (1942‚Äì45) and was inadvertently exposed to a toxic chemical agent, suffering medical consequences for the remainder of his life. Geller married Shirley Morris (a painter) in 1944. The couple lived in Northport, New York, and together had a son, Gregg Geller (formerly catalog executive at RCA, CBS and Warner Bros.) and a daughter, Jamie Geller Dutra (formerly interior designer at Loewy/Snaith). Prior to his death in December 2011 in Syracuse, Geller lived in Spencer, New York. Career with Loewy Apex Department Store Building, Pawtucket, Rhode Island (1969) After reading in Life magazine of Raymond Loewy's diverse and comprehensive career, Geller began what became a career (variously reported as 28 or 35 years) at Raymond Loewy Associates ‚Äî later known as Raymond Loewy/William Snaith Inc. or simply Loewy/Snaith. Geller went on to carry various titles at Loewy/Snaith, including 'head of the New York City architecture department', 'vice president' and 'director of design,' ‚Äî working on notable projects including the interiors and garden (with Isamu Noguchi) for the glass-and-metal Lever House. At Loewy/Snaith, Geller also designed shopping centers and department stores across the United States, notably for Macy's, Lord & Taylor, Wanamaker's, Bloomingdales, Apex Department Stores and Daytons ‚Äî as well as work for Bell Telephone, and the Worlds Fair Beirut U.S. Pavilion (year unknown). ::See: Rendering for Apex Department Stores, Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Andrew Geller Geller left Loewy/Snaith in 1976. It has been reported that at some point in his career, Geller designed the Quiet House for a Dallas, Texas, consortium, the all-aluminum Easy Care Home for the Aluminum Association of America, and the Vacation House System. In 2009, the city of Stamford, Connecticut, listed the 150,000 square foot Lord & Taylor at 110 High Ridge Road on the state's list of landmark buildings ‚Äî after the building had been inadvertently made more prominent by the razing of adjacent trees. Geller had designed the three-story building in 1969 while with Loewy/Snaith. Richard Longstreth, director of the Graduate Program in Historic Preservation at George Washington University, said the store's case for preservation was ‚Äúquite straightforward, based on the significance of the company it has housed, the nature of its siting, the firm that designed the building, and as a now rare survivor of its type.\\" ::See: Lord & Taylor, Stamford, CT, 1969, Andrew Geller and Rendering, Lord & Taylor, Stamford, CT, Andrew Geller =Kitchen Debate and Leisurama= In 1959, as vice president of the Housing and Home Components department at Loewy/Snaith, Geller was the design supervisor for the exhibition, the \\"Typical American House,\\" built at the American National Exhibition in Moscow. The exhibition home largely replicated a home previously built at 398 Townline Road in Commack, New York, which had been originally designed by Stanley H. Klein for a Long Island-based firm, All-State Properties (later known as Sadkin enterprises), headed by developer Herbert Sadkin. To accommodate visitors to the exhibition, Sadkin hired Loewy's office to modify Klein's floor plan. Geller supervised the work, which \\"split\\" the house, creating a way for large numbers of visitors to tour the small house and giving rise to its nickname, Splitnik. ::See: Geller's \\"split\\" home at the American National Exhibition and 398 Townline Road, Commack, New York, designed by Stanley H. Klein :: Subsequently, Richard Nixon (then Vice President) and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev on July 24, 1959, began what became known as the Kitchen Debate ‚Äî a debate over the merits of capitalism vs. socialism, with Khrushchev saying Americans could not afford the luxury represented by the \\"Typical American House\\". Tass, the Soviet news agency said: \\"There is no more truth in showing this as the typical home of the American worker than, say, in showing the Taj Mahal as the typical home of a Bombay textile worker.\\" The temporary 'Typical American House' exhibit was demolished, and the developer hired William Safire as the company's marketing agent. All-State later hired Loewy and Geller to design Leisurama, homes marketed at Macy's and built on Long Island ‚Äî leveraging the press coverage from the Russian exhibition. Solo career Geller became known for a number of homes in New England that he designed while moonlighting at Loewy/Snaith, with the encouragement of Loewy and Snaith. The houses each had an abstract sculptural quality; a 1999 New York Times article called the homes \\"eccentrically free-form and eye-grabbing.\\" Another article called the homes \\"ingenious wooden spacecraft.\\" Another described the houses as \\"quirky, tiny, site-specific.\\" Geller himself gave the houses nicknames such as the Butterfly, the Box Kite, Milk Carton and Grasshopper. Geller's work met a varied reception. Mark Lamster, writing for Design Observer, described Geller's Long Island house designs as \\"inexpensive and modest homes with playful shapes that radiated a sense of post-war optimism.\\" His 1966 design for the Elkin House in Sagaponack, New York, which he called Reclining Picasso was described as \\"an angular mess\\" in a 2001 The New York Times book review. ::See: Andrew Geller design sketch and Andrew Geller design sketch Examples of Geller's idiosyncratic home designs include the 1955 Reese House for Elizabeth Reese in Sagaponack, New York ‚Äî an A-Frame house that popularized the construction method after it was featured appeared on the cover of The New York Times as well as in the newspaper's real estate section of the May 5, 1957, edition. Reese, the client, was at the time the director of public relations at Loewy's office, and she publicized Geller's work ‚Äî with John Callahan of The New York Times writing several articles on his work. The Pearlroth House in Westhampton, of 1959, consists of a pair of diamond-shaped structures. When the 600square foot Pearlroth home was slated for demolition in 2006, it was called an \\"icon of Modernism.\\" The house ‚Äî which featured two boxes rotated 45 degrees in a distinctive shape ‚Äî was eventually relocated to be restored as a public museum. Architectural historian Alastair Gordon said the house \\"is one of the most important examples of experimental design built during the postwar period ‚Äì not just on Long Island but anywhere in the United States. It is witty, bold and inventive.\\" In 1958, Geller designed a beach house for bachelors. The Esquire Weekend House could be delivered to any location to be constructed on stilts. Alastair Gordan, architectural historian, called the one-room house a \\"reducto ad absurdum version of the post-war weekend aesthetic.\\" ::See: The Esquire Weekend House, rendering by Andrew Geller Publicity Geller's architectural designs on Long Island were featured in a 1999 exhibition called Weekend Utopia: The Modern Beach House on Eastern Long Island, 1960‚Äì1973, at the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, New York ‚Äî and in 2005 at an exhibit entitled Imagination: The Art and Architecture of Andrew Geller at New York's Municipal Art Society. Geller's grandson, Jake Gorst, wrote, produced and directed a 2005 documentary about his grandfather's work on the Leisurama homes. Since 2011, Gorst has actively sought to preserve the archives of Geller's works, including drawings, models and film recordings ‚Äî having used Kickstarter to help finance the archival work. Geller's Long Island Homes were subject of the 2003 book Beach Houses: Andrew Geller. The Macy's homes were the subject of the 2008 book Leisurama Now: The Beach House for Everyone, by Paul Sahre.

In the case of Cuban music, some of its most popular musical genres may be considered within the boundaries of the previous definition. The first Cuban popular music genres that emerged to the public awareness at the beginning of the 19th century, known as Punto cubano and Zapateo,Rodr√≠guez Ruid√≠az, Armando: El Punto y el Zapateo de Cuba: https://www.academia.edu/31268678/El_Punto_y_el_Zapateo_de_Cuba. were created by peasants without any formal musical education; as well as the popular styles of Rumba Urbana or \\"de caj√≥n\\" (wooden boxes) and the Cuban Carnival Conga (music).Rodr√≠guez Ruid√≠az, Armando: The origin of Cuban music. Myths and facts. https://www.academia.edu/8041795/The_origin_of_Cuban_music._Myths_and_Facts Also the Cuban Guaracha was considered to be a product of the common people from Havana, in a similar way as the Rural Rumbas and other ancestors of the Son cubano (such as Chang√º√≠ from Guant√°namo and the Sucu-sucu in Isla de Pinos) were considered to be. The Son cubano itself was born from a synthesis of different popular styles such as the Rumba Urbana and Rumba Rural, and performed until the 1930s by amateur musicians.Rodr√≠guez Ruid√≠az, Armando: The origin of Cuban music. Myths and facts. https://www.academia.edu/8041795/The_origin_of_Cuban_music._Myths_and_Facts Another Cuban folk music style emerged between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th in the poor neighborhoods of Havana. It was called Clave upon the name of the instrument utilized to accompany it, the Cuban Claves. This style was sung by popular choirs mostly integrated by colored people, called \\"Coros de Clave\\", and its rhythm was the vertical hemiola, also utilized in the ternary Cuban Contradanza.Orovio, Helio: Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, U.K., 2004, p. 54. Vertical hemiola. Instruments Cuba also has produced a wealth of folk musical instruments. Among the most important ones we should mention the Claves, the Bongo drum and the Conga, derived from original African instruments; as well as the Tres, a descendant of the Spanish La√∫d. There are also others less well known folk instruments such as the Tingo-Talango or Tumbandera (Ground bow), the Botija and the Mar√≠mbula, a sort of African Mbira.

The line between Dublin and Greystones is electrified and forms the southern part of the DART service. Between Bray and Rosslare the line is single track only. The line connected with the Limerick‚ÄìRosslare line outside Rosslare Strand until 2010. From Wicklow on, semaphore signalling was used until April 2008, when the entire line was upgraded to the mini-CTC system controlled from Dublin Connolly. Although it is considered a separate route, the line is continuous after Dublin Connolly, where it connects with the Belfast‚ÄìDublin main line. The section between Westland Row (Dublin Pearse) and a point on the line just after Salthill and Monkstown station is the oldest railway line in Ireland, opening in 1834. At that time, the railway terminated adjacent to the start of D√∫n Laoghaire Harbour's West Pier, at a station called D√∫n Laoghaire.  Services  *Monday-Friday 4 trains Dublin to Rosslare 1 train Dublin to Wexford 3 trains Rosslare to Dublin 1 train Rosslare to Dundalk 1 train Gorey to Dublin *Saturday 3 trains in each direction Dublin to Rosslare 1 train Gorey to Dundalk *Sunday 3 trains in each direction Dublin to Rosslare No freight services operate on this route as of 2015. Up until 2002, ammonia and fertiliser trains operated from Shelton Abbey near Arklow, where a fertilizer plant was located. However, this closed in late 2002, since when there have been no regular freight trains on this line. Bagged cement trains also operated in the past to Arklow and Gorey. On a few Sundays during the summer the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland operates the \\"Sea Breeze\\", a steam hauled train with heritage carriages, between Dublin and Wexford/Rosslare.  Traction  Now withdrawn 2700 Class DMU (2702) at Arklow From late July 2004, Dublin-Rosslare services have been worked exclusively by diesel railcars. Initially the railcars used were drawn from the 2700 Class fleet, but these were replaced within a year. At present, most services are worked by the 22000 Class, of which there are four carriage sets, with the 29000 Class working some services. These however, will be replaced by the 22000 Class DMU's by 2020. Prior to July 2004, services were worked by sets of Mark 2D carriages hauled by 071 class locomotives.  Signalling  In April 2008, the signalling on this route was upgraded to the mini-CTC system, controlled from Connolly Station. Apart from the Limerick Junction station area on the Dublin-Cork route, which was itself upgraded to CTC in 2011, it had been the last of the routes radiating from Dublin to use Electric Train Staff (ETS) and semaphore signalling, which was still in place south of Wicklow up until April 2008. Many of its signal cabins were situated on the corner of a footbridge. Examples include Wicklow, Rathdrum, Arklow and Gorey. At present these cabins remain in situ.  Main connections  This line connects at Dublin Connolly with the Enterprise onwards to Dundalk, Portadown and Belfast Central as well as the Sligo Line. There is also at Rosslare Europort connections by Stena Line to Fishguard Harbour to the West Wales Line onto Carmarthen, Swansea, Cardiff Central, for Reading and London Paddington.

She is a beautiful woman who was raised as a boy by her father. She is educated in such diverse arts as fencing. Eventually, she commands the Royal Guard of Queen Marie Antoinette. She has no reason to pretend to be a man because most of those at Versailles know that she is a woman. Oscar falls in love with Hans Axel von Fersen, a Swedish count. But Fersen has eyes for the queen only, and treats Oscar like a friend without knowing her true feelings for him. When the revolution begins, Andr√© tells Oscar that he loves her, and she realizes that she loves him too. Oscar gets shot and dies. She is modeled after the revolutionary Pierre-Augustin Hulin. = Andr√© Grandier = is the male protagonist in the anime, while in the manga temporarily became an important character only until his death. He is the friend of Oscar and the grandson of her nanny, Andr√© and Oscar learned the arts of fencing and horsemanship together when they were children. As they grew up, Oscar became the Dauphine's guard and the class gap between them widened. He has been described as a \\"true working-class hero\\" by Helen McCarthy. Andr√© is secretly in love with Oscar, but he never tells her until both of them decide to help the insurgents when the French Revolution begins. Oscar initially refuses his extreme advances, but later realizes she does not want to marry any other men for fear of hurting him, before realizing she also loves him back, but did not understand the nature of her love at first. Later in the series, Andr√© loses sight in his left eye to save Oscar who had been captured by the Black Knight; his condition slowly worsens until he is completely blind. Andr√© is a very sensitive and passionate man, suffering for his unrequited love for Oscar but being unable to quench his desire for her and vocally siding with the commoners in their plight. Sadly Andr√© dies from a stray bullet the day after Oscar's declaration of love, able to share only one night of passion with the woman he lived for. = Hans Axel von Fersen = is a handsome Swedish aristocrat who comes to the court of Versailles and becomes involved in a forbidden romance with queen Marie Antoinette. It is revealed in the series that Oscar also has strong feelings for Fersen. = Rosalie Lamorli√®re = Rosalie Larmoli√®re as a noble lady. is the adoptive daughter of a commoner named Nicole Lamorli√®re. She is described as \\"a stereotypical good girl, sweet, obedient and timid\\". Her biological mother is the Duchess de Polignac, referred to as Martine Gabrielle. Nicole tells Rosalie the truth when she is dying after being hit by a carriage. Rosalie swears that she will kill the person in the carriage that killed her mother. She tries to kill Oscar's mother, Lady Jarjayes, because she thought Lady Jarjayes was in the carriage, but Oscar stops Rosalie. Oscar decides to help her, and she teaches Rosalie the art of fencing, manners, history, and other courtly skills. Rosalie comes to admire and love Oscar greatly. Rosalie tells Oscar about Martine Gabrielle. At a party, Rosalie recognizes the Duchess de Polignac and tries to kill her, but Oscar stops her and tells her that killing her won't bring her mother back, and if she killed her, she would be executed. Later Oscar and Andr√© discover the true identity of Martine Gabrielle and her relationship to Rosalie. Rosalie ambushes Polignac's carriage in front of Polignac's daughter, Charlotte, but Oscar stops her. After an incident where Charlotte loses her mind and commits suicide, the Duchess de Polignac goes to Jarjayes's Mansion and tells Rosalie that if she didn't come with her, she would tell the authorities that Oscar was the protector of the sister of Jeanne of Valois- Saint-R√©my, the mastermind of the \\"Affair of the Diamond Necklace\\". Rosalie decides to go; soon, she realizes that the Duchess de Polignac intends were to marry her to the Duke of Guiche, Charlotte's ex-fianc√© and cause of her suicide. She escapes, and marries Oscar's friend, Bernard Chatelet, and meets Oscar again during the Storming of the Bastille. After the storming of the Bastille, the people burst into Versailles and take Marie Antoinette prisoner. Marie Antoinette and her family are taken to a prison, where Rosalie serves the queen as a servant, telling her all she knew about Oscar. Marie Antoinette, before the day of her execution, gives Rosalie a rose she made out of cosmetic paper, and tells her to paint it with Oscar's favorite rose color. After The Rose of Versailles ends, she appears in its sequel, Eikou no Napoleon - Eroica. Rosalie was unpopular amongst readers and so Ikeda wrote her out of the plot.  Minor characters  = Royalty and nobility =  Louis XVI  is the later King of France and the grandson of Louis XV. He becomes King after his grandfather death, but he loves Marie Antoinette so much, so he doesn't change anything for France. Later, the revolution begins, he has been captured with his family, but later is freed. Unfortunately, he tries to escape out from France, with the help from Hans Axel von Fersen, but fails. He has been jailed, and later his family, including him, are executed. Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI had four children: Marie Therese, Louis Joseph, Louis Charles, and Sophie. Louis Joseph is the heir to the French throne. Rather mature for his age, he admires Oscar and wants to be the King of France to make the country better. However, he dies at age 7.  Louis XV  is the King of France and grandfather of the Dauphin. He has a lover, Madame du Barry. He dies of smallpox in the Palace of Versailles. After his death, his heir and grandson becomes the King of France. The people of all the cities celebrate the birth of a new kingdom.  Madame du Barry  was not born noble. She used to be a prostitute, and thanks to that she manages to enter into the court by becoming the lover of King Louis XV. When Marie Antoinette becomes princess of France, they become enemies. Maria Theresa of Austria, queen of Austria and mother of Marie Antoinette, sends her advisor, Comte de Mercy, to France. Mercy advises the princess to stop fighting with Du Barry, but Marie Antoinette does not obey the warnings until King Louis XV shows his displeasure with her attitude towards the countess. Marie Antoinette finally speaks to Du Barry. Months later, King Louis XV gets smallpox. Before dying, the bishop, hearing Louis's confession, and orders the removal of the King's sin, that is to say, Madame Du Barry. King Louis XV dies and Du Barry is taken to a convent, where she remains until 1793, the year in which she is guillotined.  Duke of Orl√©ans  The is cousin of Louis XVI, who secretly tried to usurp the throne. Second in row to the throne of France. He is the mastermind in the plot to kidnap Marie Antoinette before she could marry prince Louis XVI, but after it failed thanks to Lady Oscar's intervention, he tried to kill the Prince and make it seem like an accident by switching the rifle Prince Louis XVI used for hunting with a tampered one that would explode once triggered. Later in the story, Duke de Orleans, because of his liberal ideas, lets anti-monarchists like the Black Knight (a masked French Robin Hood) and his followers secretly gather in his Palais Royale. He, masked, helped Jeanne of Valois-Saint-R√©my, the mastermind of the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, to escape from Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital's prison to a convent. Then, he covered the expenses of the publication of the Jeanne memories, in which Marie Antoinette's visits to clandestine casinos with the Duchesse de Polignac, the \\"complicity\\" between the Queen and Lady Oscar and other rumours are started.  Duchess of Polignac  is a singer of the Palace of Versailles, but she does not live there. Marie Antoinette listens to her and quickly makes her best friend. She impelled Marie Antoinette to bet in clandestine casinos, without the permission of Marie Antoinette's husband, King Louis XVI. She manipulated the queen for her own benefit and made the queen believe that lies would fix her difficult situations. Following her advice, Marie Antoinette lied and announced that the heir of France was on way. To remedy the situation, Polignac blamed the death of the heir on Lady Oscar. During the Revolution, she manages to flee with her family. The Duchess has a daughter, Charlotte, who is traumatized by her mother's plan to marry her to the Duke de Guiche. Charlotte, not knowing what will happen to her, loses all reason, and commits suicide, jumping from one of the towers of the Palace of Versailles. She dies without knowing that she had a half-sister named Rosalie.  Henri de Gu√©m√©n√©  Henri de Gu√©m√©n√© is a cruel, cold nobleman who resorts to violence and kills a young boy for a petty crime, appalling Rosalie, Oscar, and Andr√©.  The Count of Girodelle  The Count of Girodelle is Oscar's arranged fianc√©, who treats Oscar only as a woman. To retaliate against him, she dresses in her uniform and dances with women at her engagement party, and the engagement is called off.  General Bouill√©  General Bouill√©  Colonel d'Agoult  Colonel d'Agoult is the deputy commander of the Company B, the troops assigned to Lady Oscar's service in the National Guard. He has always followed his commander, but as one of the nobles most devoted to the monarchy, when she betrays to join the people in revolt, he abandons the regiment and returns to Versailles. Oscar lets him go. = Revolutionaries =  Maximilien Robespierre  Maximilien Robespierre is the political leader.  Louis Antoine de Saint- Just  Louis Antoine de Saint-Just is the assassin.  Bernard Ch√¢telet  Bernard Ch√¢telet is Robespierre's follower. He has disguised as the Black Knight, and later marries Rosalie, and the pair survive the execution of Robespierre and Saint-Just. He and Rosalie along with Alain are also featured in Eikou no Napoleon ‚Äì Eroica.  Third Estate  = Alain de Soissons = Alain de Soissons is a military. After his father's death, he helped his mother to raise his beloved little sister Diane as much as he could, enrolling in the military. Diane committed suicide after her fianc√© married a rich woman just days before their marriage. Alain was the sergeant of the Company B, the troops assigned to Lady Oscar's service in the National Guard. He accepted Oscar at first, and even befriended Andr√© and smuggled him in the troops, but after learning the truth about her he violently rejected her leadership. Oscar had to fight him to win Alain and the group's respect back, since they refused to be ordered around by a noble. After losing to Oscar and begging her to save the life of a companion who was about to be executed, which she did, Alain forgave Oscar and became fiercely devoted to her, even falling in love with her in the manga; still, he knew he couldn't fight against her feelings for Andr√©. Ultimately, Alain survives the French Revolution and the Terror, becoming a major character in Eikou no Napoleon ‚Äì Eroica.

S.) Turner, OBE (17 November 1909 ‚Äì 6 July 2006) was an English freelance journalist and author who published 20 books, including Boys Will Be Boys (Michael Joseph, 1948), The Phoney War on the Home Front (St. Martin's Press, 1961), and What The Butler Saw (Penguin, 1962), and contributing to the Times Literary Supplement, London Review of Books, and regularly to the English satirical weekly magazine Punch (the latter for more than 50 years). Early life and education E. S. Turner was born in the Wavertree Garden suburb of Liverpool in the North West of England on 17 November 1909.The obituary in The Scotsman refers to his birth being in Northumbria, see that reference. His father, Frederick William Turner, \\"a churchgoer and a teetotaller, [and] a desk-man in the Post Office Engineering Department in Liverpool,\\" was a descendant of Sir Barnard Turner, an Alderman and sheriff in London who commanded troops attempting to curb looting in the 1780 Gordon Riots in 1780,Andrew O‚ÄôHagan, 1998, \\"Seventy Years in a Filthy Trade: Andrew O‚ÄôHagan meets E.S. Turner\\", London Review of Books, Vol. 20 No. 20, 15 October. 1998, pp. 3-6, see accessed 27 May 2015.L. Namier & J. Brooke, 1985 [1964], \\"Turner, Sir Barnard (?1742-84), of Paul's Wharf, London\\", in The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1754‚Äì1790, London: Secker & Warburg, , see , accessed 28 May 2015. but who later died penniless less than a month into Parliament's assembly, after his election in 1784. Turner's mother, Bertha Pixton Norbury, was an amateur portrait and landscape painter, and oversaw a home \\"built for a class‚Ä¶ [her son E.S. thought] extinct, that of ‚Äòmeritorious artisans‚Äô\\", with a \\"family bookcase... weighted with the massed works of Swedenborg‚Ä¶ and a ‚Äòsplendid‚Äô volume called The Bible in Pitman's Shorthand.\\" Turner's first school was in Shrewsbury, where he is said to have been \\"a good pupil\\", winning \\"a few prizes\\" and enjoying \\"memorising passages of Macaulay's Lays.\\" He went on to Orme Boys' School in Newcastle-under-Lyme, and \\"[a]lthough he had the reserved, courteous and erudite air of an Oxbridge don\\", Turner never went on to attend university. At the age of 17 his father presented him with \\"an ancient typewriter [purchased] for a fiver from a passing lorry\\", supporting his desire to write.Turner's \\"series of second-hand typewriters\\" was worthy of note; Turner recollected this apparent first purchase to LRB interviewer Andrew O‚ÄôHagan, thus: \\"I remember a van arriving out of the blue with a fine stock of near-prehistoric machines\\" whereupon his \\"father very decently bought one of these for ¬£5 and I used it for many years.\\" See O‚ÄôHagan, 1996, LRB, op. cit. Career =Early career= Turner published his first piece in the Dundee Courier in 1927. He applied for a \\"day job\\" with the Glasgow Evening Times that same year, where he became \\"a sharp eye‚Ä¶ and in time a sharp voice.\\" There, he progressed from \\"office junior to the sub-editors' bench and then became one of the paper's cub reporters‚Ä¶ and [later] was made editor of the paper's Diary.\\" Stating this another way, Jonathan Sale of The Guardian described it as his\\"work[ing] his way up from copy boy to subeditor, reporter and gossip column editor.\\" At the Evening Times, he recalled \\"the staggered newspapers, four mornings and three evenings, all receptive to freelance contributions\\" and that the \\"subs... were a profane lot\\" that \\"knew their jobs.\\" A perk of the Evening Times work was to be allowed travel on the maiden voyage of the RMS Queen Mary in May 1936, from Southampton, England to New York city in the U.S.‚Äî\\"About a hundred reporters\\", he [said] \\"each of us desperate to find a stowaway\\"‚Äîone of a series of ocean voyages about which he would write. Such travels would contribute to two later pseudonymous Rupert Lang novels, and to a final London Review of Books (LRB) piece written with his first hand information on ocean liners. After the 1936 voyages, he spent \\"some months\\" working at Glasgow Evening Citizen and then at the Scottish Daily Express. At the Daily Express, a fellow sub was prominent British journalist James Cameron, who he described as \\"a good friend, a brilliant reporter.\\" In this period between the wars, he added voyages on liners flying under the flags of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, as well as of the Anchor Line, from Glasgow, and did a motor tour in \\"swastika-hung\\" Germany in a Morgan three-wheeled automobile. Turner moved toward the decision to go freelance over these years, formally doing so in 1938. =War years= After the onset of war in 1939, he continued to write for various publications, even after he joined the Royal Artillery in 1941. He was able to contribute during his spare time in the Army, being based in the UK throughout the hostilities. At one point, whilst he was on leave, his anti-aircraft unit actually saw action when they shot down a German bomber. Realising his writing talents, the Army 'top brass' decided to put him to work in a more appropriate area ‚Äì helping to set up and publish Soldier, the magazine of the British Army. This contributed to his promotion to the rank of major in 1946, coinciding with his appointment as Literary editor of the magazine. He held this title even after 'demob', until 1957. =Middle years= In 1948 Michael Joseph's publishing firm issued his first book, Boys Will Be Boys: The Story of Sweeney Todd, Deadwood Dick, Sexton Blake, Billy Bunter, Dick Barton, et al. ‚Äì usually truncated to Boys Will Be Boys. This was an in-depth examination of the \\"Boys' Weekly\\" genr√©, also known as 'story papers', 'penny dreadfuls' or 'bloods' (due to the violent nature of the prose). He carried out research for the book, ploughing through numerous back-numbers of the various publications.Jonathan Sale, 2006, \\"Obituary: E.S. Turner, Stalwart of Punch and the patron saint of freelancing\\", The Guardian (online), 18 July 2006, see , accessed 27 May 2015. For his second book, however, he changed direction completely, producing the 1950 non-fiction work Roads to Ruin: A Shocking History of Social Progress, which was a forthright insight into the British class system, and the resistance of the upper class to significant change. The politician Tony Benn often quoted passages from the book in the House of Commons to illustrate points he was trying to make, and especially in 1992, during one particular debate on foxhunting.Tony Benn foxhunting quotation: Hansard Debates, 14 February 1992, House of Commons. Turner was also quoted by another politician, Gerald Kaufman, during a 1996 debate on homosexuality in the Armed Forces.Gerald Kaufman quotation: Hansard Debates, 9 May 1996, House of Commons. During the 1950s, as a now permanent freelance writer, Turner contributed regularly to Punch Magazine, the leading satirical magazine with the accent on humour and pastiche. This source of income enabled him to concentrate more on writing books. Turner's literary flexibility was illustrated when he wrote a Betjeman-style pastiche for the Royal wedding of The Princess Anne and Mark Phillips on 14 November 1973, subsequently quoted in an obituary by Miles Kington in 2006.Pastiche for the Royal wedding : Miles Kington, The Independent obituaries. In all, some 19 works by Turner were published in book form during his most productive period, including two novels under the pseudonym of \\"Rupert Lang.\\" =Late career= E. S. Turner contributed many pieces in his later years to publications such as the Times Literary Supplement and the London Review of Books.Anon., 2006, \\"Obituary: E. S. Turner, Novelist and journalist\\", The Scotsman (online), 19 July 2006, see , accessed 27 May 2015. At the age of 89, he published \\"Unholy Pursuits\\", which took as its subject the incidence of Anglican clergymen working anonymously as journalists (a profession considered well beneath them at the time). Its 1998 release coincided with him being dropped by his regular publishers.\\"Unholy Pursuits\\", a book by Turner released in 1998: Telegraph.co.uk website. His final article was published posthumously in the magazine \\"The Oldie\\" in September 2006.Obituary ‚Äì E. S. Turner: The North West Enquirer website. Turner died in London on 6 July 2006. Critical appraisal Appraisal in retrospect looks at Turner's dedication to freelance writing‚ÄîJonathan Sale referred to him as \\"the patron saint of freelancing\\"‚Äîand has focused on his energy, productivity, the scope of his writing, and on its inherent humanity.Anon., 2006, \\"Obituary: E. S. Turner\\", The Telegraph (online), 17 July 2006, see , accessed 27 May 2015. Andrew O'Hagan, in his 1998 LRB retrospective, noted that while Turner's fingers had always been light on the keyboard, his writing was \\"with a strongly human pulse just under the skin, a richness of personal feeling in the blood.\\" The Telegraph noted in its obituary that Turner, over \\"succeeding decades... produced a stream of books... praised by reviewers; it was said that the author had invented a new kind of book which demonstrated the British genius for tremendous trifles.\\" Miles Kington, a fellow journalist intersecting with Turner at Punch recalls Turner at editorial lunches: Some mention is made of political leanings‚ÄîO'Hagan refers to Turner as \\"never a left-wing diehard\\" and as having a \\"rightwing persona (which was only partly a pose)\\"‚Äîbut these are not thoroughly explored, and during a House of Commons debate on the foxhunting issue, Labour MP Tony Benn quoted from Roads to Ruin: A Shocking History of Social Progress (1950), the book where Turner exposed the upper class's \\"disgraceful rearguard action‚Ä¶\\" against reforms such as \\"abolition of child chimney sweeps and the repeal of laws under which convicted criminals could be hung, drawn and quartered.\\"Though, it is said of this re-use, that Turner \\"was not thought to have been flattered\\", see The Scotsman obituary, op. cit. O'Hagan also writes that \\"when I once asked Ernest how such a liberal classic could be written by someone with his rightwing persona‚Ä¶ he growled that he would like to rewrite the book‚Äîfrom the opposite view\\", see Sales, 1998, LRB, op. cit. WIth regard to the correctness of his writing, when viewed from a 21st-century perspective, O'Hagan writes that \\"[t]he Britain Mr Turner writes about may (like Punch) no longer be here‚Ä¶ There's always a whole new set of things you‚Äôre not allowed to laugh at‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt laugh at newsagents. You can‚Äôt snigger at class, or Princess Diana, even if you‚Äôre the sort of person who might always have done so. Mr Turner might say we fought for the right to say farewell to Smith, the right to meet Patel. But it would not be a popular thing to say.\\" Personal life Turner met Helen Martin from New York City in the U.S., and they married in 1937 and would see 30 anniversaries; they would have two daughters, Patricia and Jill. Helen died in 1968. After his first wife's death, Turner was travelling in Samarkand doing a travel article for the Sunday Telegraph and met Belfast-born Roberta Hewitt, a housing manager, and they married in 1971. She, and daughters Patricia and Jill from the marriage to Helen, survived Turner at his death in 2006. A formal man and an Edwardian, Ernest Sackville Turner is said to have \\"clung to the dignity of his formal style and title\\": In the 1998 LRB interview, O'Hagan noted, \\"Sometimes Mr Turner can‚Äôt think of an answer to one of my questions. But when he sits at the typewriter, and begins to write, great swathes of his story come clean. He would later send me these typed pages. And they sit here in front of me now, covered in shadows of print, and they speak of a man altogether present.\\" O'Hagan goes on to quote the author of 80 years of journalism, 50 years of Punch contributions, and 20 published books, to say, \\"I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôll get a whole article out of me... ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt a whole lot to say.‚Äô\\" Published works The following are some of Turner's main book-length published works, with sources as indicated: * Boys Will Be Boys: The Story of Sweeney Todd, Deadwood Dick, Sexton Blake, Billy Bunter, Dick Barton et al.

The derivations in this article are essentially self-contained and can be found in many texts on numerical linear algebra or numerical functional analysis. Example Suppose we have solutions to the generalized eigenvalue problem, :\\\\mathbf{K}_0 \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} = \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}. \\\\qquad (0) where \\\\mathbf{K}_0 and \\\\mathbf{M}_0 are matrices. That is, we know the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for . It is also required that the eigenvalues be distinct. Now suppose we want to change the matrices by a small amount. That is, we want to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of :\\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{x}_i = \\\\lambda_i \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{x}_i \\\\qquad (1) where :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{K} &= \\\\mathbf{K}_0 + \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{M} &= \\\\mathbf{M}_0 + \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\end{align} with the perturbations \\\\delta\\\\mathbf{K} and \\\\delta\\\\mathbf{M} much smaller than \\\\mathbf{K} and \\\\mathbf{M} respectively. Then we expect the new eigenvalues and eigenvectors to be similar to the original, plus small perturbations: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\lambda_i &= \\\\lambda_{0i}+\\\\delta\\\\lambda_{i}  \\\\mathbf{x}_i &= \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\delta\\\\mathbf{x}_{i} \\\\end{align} Steps We assume that the matrices are symmetric and positive definite, and assume we have scaled the eigenvectors such that : \\\\mathbf{x}_{0j}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{M}_0\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} = \\\\delta_{ij} \\\\qquad(2) where is the Kronecker delta. Now we want to solve the equation :\\\\mathbf{K}\\\\mathbf{x}_i = \\\\lambda_i \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{x}_i. Substituting, we get :(\\\\mathbf{K}_0+\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K})(\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{x}_{i}) = \\\\left (\\\\lambda_{0i}+\\\\delta\\\\lambda_{i} \\\\right ) \\\\left (\\\\mathbf{M}_0+ \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\right ) \\\\left (\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}+\\\\delta\\\\mathbf{x}_{i} \\\\right ), which expands to :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{K}_0\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} &\\\\+ \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K}\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\mathbf{K}_0\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{x}_i + \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K}\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{x}_i = \\\\[6pt] &=\\\\lambda_{0i}\\\\mathbf{M}_0\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}+\\\\lambda_{0i}\\\\mathbf{M}_0\\\\delta\\\\mathbf{x}_i + \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} +\\\\delta\\\\lambda_i\\\\mathbf{M}_0\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\delta\\\\mathbf{x}_i + \\\\delta\\\\lambda_i \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M}\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\delta\\\\lambda_i\\\\mathbf{M}_0\\\\delta\\\\mathbf{x}_i + \\\\delta\\\\lambda_i \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\delta\\\\mathbf{x}_i. \\\\end{align} Canceling from (0) (\\\\mathbf{K}_0 \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} = \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}) leaves :\\\\begin{align} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\mathbf{K}_0\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{x}_i + \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K}\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{x}_i = \\\\lambda_{0i}\\\\mathbf{M}_0\\\\delta\\\\mathbf{x}_i + \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\delta\\\\lambda_i\\\\mathbf{M}_0\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\delta\\\\mathbf{x}_i + \\\\delta\\\\lambda_i \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\delta\\\\lambda_i\\\\mathbf{M}_0\\\\delta\\\\mathbf{x}_i + \\\\delta\\\\lambda_i \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\delta\\\\mathbf{x}_i. \\\\end{align} Removing the higher-order terms, this simplifies to :\\\\mathbf{K}_0 \\\\delta\\\\mathbf{x}_i+ \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} = \\\\lambda_{0i}\\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{x}_i + \\\\lambda_{0i}\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathrm{x}_{0i} + \\\\delta \\\\lambda_i \\\\mathbf{M}_0\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}. \\\\qquad(3) When the matrix is symmetric, the unperturbed eigenvectors are orthogonal and so we use them as a basis for the perturbed eigenvectors. That is, we want to construct :\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{x}_i = \\\\sum_{j=1}^N \\\\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0j} \\\\qquad (4) where the are small constants that are to be determined. Substituting (4) into (3) and rearranging gives :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{K}_0 \\\\sum_{j=1}^N \\\\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0j} + \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} &= \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\sum_{j=1}^N \\\\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0j} + \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\delta\\\\lambda_i \\\\mathbf{M}_0\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} && (5)  \\\\sum_{j=1}^N \\\\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\mathbf{K}_0 \\\\mathbf{x}_{0j} + \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} &= \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\sum_{j=1}^N \\\\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0j} + \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\delta\\\\lambda_i \\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} && \\\\text{Applying } \\\\mathbf{K}_0 \\\\text{ to the sum}  \\\\sum_{j=1}^N \\\\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\lambda_{0j} \\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\mathbf{x}_{0j} + \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} &= \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\sum_{j=1}^N \\\\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0j} + \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\delta\\\\lambda_i \\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} && \\\\text{Using Eq. } (1) \\\\end{align} Because the eigenvectors are -orthogonal when is positive definite, we can remove the summations by left-multiplying by \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top: :\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\varepsilon_{ii} \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} = \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\varepsilon_{ii} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\lambda_{0i}\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\delta\\\\lambda_i\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}. By use of equation (1) again: :\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{K}_0 \\\\varepsilon_{ii} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} = \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{M}_0\\\\varepsilon_{ii} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\lambda_{0i}\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M}\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\delta\\\\lambda_i\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}. \\\\qquad (6) The two terms containing are equal because left-multiplying (1) by \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top gives :\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top\\\\mathbf{K}_0\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} = \\\\lambda_{0i}\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}. Canceling those terms in (6) leaves :\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} = \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} + \\\\delta\\\\lambda_i \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{M}_0\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}. Rearranging gives :\\\\delta\\\\lambda_i = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\top_{0i} \\\\left (\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K}- \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\right )\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}}{\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}^\\\\top\\\\mathbf{M}_0 \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}} But by (2), this denominator is equal to 1. Thus :\\\\delta\\\\lambda_i = \\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\top_{0i} \\\\left (\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} - \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\right )\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}. Then, by left-multiplying equation (5) by \\\\mathbf{x}_{0k}^\\\\top: :\\\\varepsilon_{ik} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\top_{0k} \\\\left (\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} - \\\\lambda_{0i}\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\right )\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}}{\\\\lambda_{0i}-\\\\lambda_{0k}}, \\\\qquad i eq k. Or by changing the name of the indices: :\\\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\top_{0j} \\\\left (\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} - \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\right )\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}}{\\\\lambda_{0i}-\\\\lambda_{0j}}, \\\\qquad i eq j. To find , use the fact that: :\\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\top_i \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{x}_i = 1 implies: :\\\\varepsilon_{ii}=-\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\top_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}.  Summary  :\\\\begin{align} \\\\lambda_i &= \\\\lambda_{0i} + \\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\top_{0i} \\\\left (\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} - \\\\lambda_{0i}\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\right ) \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}  \\\\mathbf{x}_i &= \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} \\\\left (1 - \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\top_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} \\\\right ) + \\\\sum_{j=1\\\\atop j eq i}^N \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\top_{0j}\\\\left (\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} - \\\\lambda_{0i}\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\right ) \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}}{\\\\lambda_{0i}-\\\\lambda_{0j}} \\\\mathbf{x}_{0j} \\\\end{align} for infinitesimal \\\\delta\\\\mathbf{K} and \\\\delta\\\\mathbf{M} (the high order terms in (3) being negligible) Results This means it is possible to efficiently do a sensitivity analysis on as a function of changes in the entries of the matrices. (Recall that the matrices are symmetric and so changing will also change , hence the term.) :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\lambda_i}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{K}_{(k\\\\ell)}} &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{K}_{(k\\\\ell)}}\\\\left(\\\\lambda_{0i} + \\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\top_{0i} \\\\left (\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} - \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\right ) \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i} \\\\right) = x_{0i(k)} x_{0i(\\\\ell)} \\\\left (2 - \\\\delta_{k\\\\ell} \\\\right )  \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\lambda_i}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{M}_{(k\\\\ell)}} &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{M}_{(k\\\\ell)}}\\\\left(\\\\lambda_{0i} + \\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\top_{0i} \\\\left (\\\\delta \\\\mathbf{K} - \\\\lambda_{0i} \\\\delta \\\\mathbf{M} \\\\right ) \\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}\\\\right) = \\\\lambda_i x_{0i(k)} x_{0i(\\\\ell)} \\\\left (2- \\\\delta_{k\\\\ell} \\\\right ). \\\\end{align} Similarly :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{x}_i}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{K}_{(k\\\\ell)}} &= \\\\sum_{j=1\\\\atop j eq i}^N \\\\frac{x_{0j(k)} x_{0i(\\\\ell)} \\\\left (2-\\\\delta_{k\\\\ell} \\\\right )}{\\\\lambda_{0i}-\\\\lambda_{0j}}\\\\mathbf{x}_{0j}  \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}_i}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{M}_{(k\\\\ell)}} &= -\\\\mathbf{x}_{0i}\\\\frac{x_{0i(k)}x_{0i(\\\\ell)}}{2}(2-\\\\delta_{k\\\\ell}) - \\\\sum_{j=1\\\\atop j eq i}^N \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{0i}x_{0j(k)} x_{0i(\\\\ell)}}{\\\\lambda_{0i}-\\\\lambda_{0j}}\\\\mathbf{x}_{0j} \\\\left (2-\\\\delta_{k\\\\ell} \\\\right ). \\\\end{align} Existence of eigenvectors Note that in the above example we assumed that both the unperturbed and the perturbed systems involved symmetric matrices, which guaranteed the existence of N linearly independent eigenvectors. An eigenvalue problem involving non- symmetric matrices is not guaranteed to have N linearly independent eigenvectors, though a sufficient condition is that \\\\mathbf{K} and \\\\mathbf{M} be simultaneously diagonalizable.

It is defined in the same way as de Rham cohomology except that one uses square-integrable differential forms. The notion of square-integrability makes sense because the metric on M gives rise to a norm on differential forms and a volume form. L2 cohomology, which grew in part out of L2 d-bar estimates from the 1960s, was studied cohomologically, independently by Steven Zucker (1978) and Jeff Cheeger (1979). It is closely related to intersection cohomology; indeed, the results in the preceding cited works can be expressed in terms of intersection cohomology. Another such result is the Zucker conjecture, which states that for a Hermitian locally symmetric variety the L2 cohomology is isomorphic to the intersection cohomology (with the middle perversity) of its Baily‚ÄìBorel compactification (Zucker 1982). This was proved in different ways by Eduard Looijenga (1988) and by Leslie Saper and Mark Stern (1990). References  *Cheeger, Jeff On the Hodge theory of Riemannian pseudomanifolds.

He is credited with developing the Atwater system, which laid the groundwork for nutrition science in the United States and inspired modern Olympic nutrition.Olympians Owe Gold Standard to 19th Century Chemist, Fox News. By Paul Martin. Published 31 July 2012. Retrieved 4 August 2012. Atwater was director of the first United States Agricultural Experiment Station at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut and he was the U.S. Department of Agriculture's first chief of nutrition investigations. Early life Atwater was born in Johnsburg, New York, the son of William Warren Atwater, a Methodist Episcopal minister, temperance advocate, and librarian of Yale Law School and Eliza (Barnes) Atwater. He grew up in, and spent much of his life in New England. He opted not to fight in the American Civil War, instead pursuing his undergraduate education, first at the University of Vermont and then moving to Wesleyan University in Connecticut, where he would complete his general education in 1865. For the next three years, Atwater was a teacher at various schools and in 1868, he enrolled in Yale University's Sheffield Scientific School, where he studied agricultural chemistry under William Henry Brewer and Samuel William Johnson. During his time at Yale, Atwater worked part time as Johnson's assistant analyzing fertilizers for specific mineral content; he also performed the first chemical analysis of food or feed in the United States. Atwater received his doctorate in 1869 in agricultural chemistry, his thesis was entitled The Proximate Composition of Several Types of American Maize, in it he used variations of the proximate analysis system to analyze four varieties of corn. Afterwards, he continued his education for the next two years in Leipzig and Berlin, studying physiological chemistry and acquainting himself with the agricultural experiment stations of Europe. During his time there, Atwater studied under German physiologist and dietitian, Carl von Voit and worked alongside Voit's student, Max Rubner. Atwater spent time traveling throughout Scotland, Rome, and Naples; on his trip he wrote articles about his observations for local newspapers based in the places he had lived in the United States. In 1871, Atwater returned to the United States to teach Chemistry at East Tennessee University and the next year moved to Maine State College. While there, Atwater met Marcia Woodard (1851-1932) of Bangor, Maine, the daughter of Abram Woodard. They married in 1874 and in 1876, their daughter Helen was born and son Charles was born in 1885.  Career  Wilbur Atwater returned to Wesleyan as a professor of chemistry in 1873 and remained there until his death in 1907. Both he, and his mentor from Yale, Samuel Johnson, were proponents of bringing organizations to the United States similar to the agricultural experiment stations they saw in Europe. Atwater even described the German agricultural experiment stations in an 1875 report to the Department of Agriculture. To persuade the Connecticut legislature to appropriate money for a station, Orange Judd donated funds and Wesleyan offered laboratory facilities and Atwater's services on a part-time basis. Through their work and a $5,600 contribution from the Connecticut legislature for a two-year trial period, the first agricultural experiment station was created in the United States. Atwater served as administrator of the trial run from 1875 until 1877 with initial research focused on fertilizers. Before the two year trial was over, the Connecticut legislature agreed to regular funding of the station but had decided to move the permanent Connecticut Experiment Station to the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale with Samuel Johnson as first director. During this time, Atwater wrote numerous articles for scientific periodicals detailing his research and findings in physiological and agricultural chemistry and on research being conducted abroad (specifically in Germany). Many of his articles appeared in a column called \\"Science Applied to Farming\\", mostly discussing agricultural fertilizers in Orange Judd's American Agriculturalist. During the initial phase of the first experiment station, Atwater expanded his fertilizer program and began to study and experiment with the growth and composition of field crops. The field crop research continued even after the appropriation ceased on a nearby farm; Atwater became particularly interested in plant metabolism and was one of the first researchers to provide proof that legumes assimilate nitrogen from the air. As his experiments and accomplishments became known, Atwater's assistance was requested for a variety of projects. From 1879 to 1882, he conducted extensive human food studies on behalf of the United States Fish Commission and Smithsonian Institute. In 1879, the U.S. Fish Commission offered Atwater funds to study the composition and nutritional value of North American species of fish and invertebrates. For the 1882-1883 school year, Atwater took a leave of absence from Wesleyan to study the digestibility of lean fish with von Voit in Germany. Together, they found fish comparable to lean beef; during this time he became aware of how German scientists were studying nutrition and hoped to bring similar research to the United States upon his return. In 1885, Atwater's first series of studies on peas grown in nutrient solution were published in the American Chemical Journal. That same year, the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor requested a study of data that had been collected by the bureau concerning family food purchases. In the study, Atwater calculated the daily per capita supplies of carbohydrates, fat, and protein provided within the data, and taking into account the included cost data, made recommendations on how more economical diets, while still having adequate nutritional value, could be chosen. The report he prepared was included in the Bureau's 1886 Annual Report. Throughout this time, Atwater continued to campaign and support the expansion of state agricultural experiment stations. Due to their European research and experience with the government-funded European experiment stations, Atwater and Johnson had become consultants to the USDA and vocal promoters of federally regulated and funded agricultural research. Atwater had even begun writing in USDA publications in support of adopting the European model of scientific laboratories in domestic experiment stations. By 1885, Atwater and Johnson had begun advising Congress and President Grover Cleveland on the creation of experiment stations at the land-grant colleges created through the Morrill Act in 1862. In 1887, the Hatch Act was passed, which gave federal funds ($15,000 each) to the land-grant colleges to create experiment stations. As the Act was passed, Atwater was named director of the second agricultural experiment station in Connecticut that was established at Storrs Agricultural College, and he served there until 1892. The following year, the Office of Experiment Stations was created as a means to monitor and appraise the experiments and activities of the stations; Atwater was chosen as the first director. He accepted the position on the condition of being able to maintain both his professorship, and his position of director at the new Storrs agricultural experiment station. Atwater spent about 8 months of the year in Washington and had deputies act for him in his other positions during his absence. Atwater saw his mission as director of the Office of Experiment Stations to be \\"to bring the stations throughout the country together, to unify their work, and to put them into communication with the great world of science.\\" He immediately established a journal, the Experiment Station Record, meant to be a means of keeping the stations abreast of the scientific research being conducted by their colleagues and scientists abroad. Atwater made clear that the publication was meant to be a collection of scientific papers and not a platform for swapping farm tips. The publication was a means for the Hatch Act stations to report their research to the USDA, while also holding scientists accountable to particular standards of research and reporting. At the same time, Farmers' Bulletins were created to provide farmers with an easy to read and understand presentation of the findings of agricultural research stations and other scientific institutions. Through Atwater's role as director he was able to guide agricultural experiment station research towards scientific and experiment based methods.  Nutrition research and innovation  Throughout his career, Atwater had been interested in human nutrition studies; having conducted the studies on behalf of the U.S. Fish Commission and the Smithsonian Institute, he had continued human nutrition research and the Storrs experiment station became known for nutritional studies. Once the Storrs station was created, Atwater and his colleagues had begun conducting and publishing studies on the chemical compositions of food. In 1891, he resigned as director of the Office of Experiment Stations in order to return to the Storrs and focus exclusively on nutrition research. After his resignation, Atwater was appointed special agent in charge of nutrition programs. Through this position he organized extensive food analyses, dietary studies, experiments on the digestibility of food, investigations of energy requirements using human subjects, and studies of the cost and economics of food use and production. In 1894, Atwater received his first congressional appropriation, allocated to his laboratory for human nutrition research. Atwater's studies during this time were used to create dietary standards. He based the standards off of average intakes, but did not regard them as quantitatively accurate; they logically varied based on age, sex, and activity level but he stressed that they were not metabolic studies. Subject exits respirator calorimeter in Atwater's laboratory. Courtesy of Special Collections, U.S. National Agricultural Library He went on to conduct metabolic studies related to the dietary standards, based on observations from his work with Voit, who had used a Rubner respiration calorimeter to conduct similar experiments on small animals. Together with Charles Ford Langworthy, they compiled a digest of close to 3,600 metabolic experiments as a primer to the research they would conduct. Atwater went on to work with Physicist Edward Bennett Rosa and Nutritionist Francis Gano Benedict to design the first direct calorimeter large enough to accommodate human subjects for a period of days. The calorimeter, or human respiration apparatus, was built to precisely measure the energy provided by food. Atwater wanted to use it to study and compare the nutrient contents of different foods and how the human body consumes those nutrients under various conditions of rest and work.Hartford Courant, Counting Calories? You Can Thank ‚Äî Or Blame ‚Äî Wesleyan Professor, by William Weir, November 23, 2011 The calorimeter measured human metabolism by analyzing the heat produced by a person performing certain physical activities; in 1896 they began the first of what would accumulate into close to 500 experiments. Through their experiments, they were able to create a system - which became known as the Atwater system, to measure the energy in units, known as food calories. With the machine, the dynamics of metabolism could be quantified and the relationship between food intake and energy output could be measured. \\"The experiments are made with a man inside a cabinet, or a respiration chamber, as it is called. It is in fact a box of copper incased [sic] in walls of zinc and wood. In this chamber he lives‚Äîeats, drinks, works, rests, and sleeps. There is a constant supply of fresh air for ventilation. The temperature is kept at the point most agreeable to the occupant. Within the chamber are a small folding cot-bed, a chair, and a table. In the daytime the bed is folded and laid aside, so as to leave room for the man to sit at the table or to walk to and fro. His promenade, however, is limited, the chamber being 7 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 6 feet high. Food and drink are passed into the chamber through an aperture which serves also for the removal of the solid and liquid excretory products, and the passing in and out of toilet materials, books, and other things required for comfort and convenience.\\" His research was informed by the first law of thermodynamics, taking into account that energy can be transformed but it cannot be created or destroyed, despite the belief at the time that the law only applied to animals because humans were unique. Earlier experiments concerning calorie intake and expenditure had proven that the first law applied to animals and Atwater's findings demonstrated the law applied to humans as well. Through the experiments he demonstrated that whatever amount of energy consumed by humans that could not be used was stored in the body. Through the calorimetry studies, greater awareness was brought to the food calorie as a unit of measure both for consumption and metabolism. Atwater reported on the weight of the calorie as a means to measure the efficiency of a diet and that different types of food produced different amounts of energy. Through his research, he was able to demonstrate that calories from different sources might affect the body differently and in turn, published tables that compared calories in various foods. Atwater also studied the effect of alcohol on the body. His findings showed humans generated heat from alcohol just as they generated heat from a carbohydrate. At a time when the Scientific Temperance Federation and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union doubted the nutritional value of alcohol, Atwater proved alcohol could be oxidized in the body and used to some extent as fuel. Information gained from Atwater‚Äôs experiments was used by the liquor trade in the promotion of alcohol. \\"[Atwater] was very prominent in the temperance movement, and every year he would lecture the students about temperance and tried to promote [abstention from alcohol],\\" ... \\"Being a good scientist, he reported the data and was very upset that alcohol companies used his research\\" to advertise their products.  Death and Legacy  In 1904, Atwater suffered a stroke and remained unable to work until his death in 1907. He is interred at Indian Hill Cemetery in Middletown, Connecticut. During his decline, the program at Wesleyan continue through his associates. His collaborator and successor, Frances Benedict continued his work and helped establish a Nutrition Laboratory in Boston with funding from the Carnegie Corporation. Initially, the funding was meant construct a new laboratory for Atwater and fund his continued work; however, with the realization that he would not be returning, the funds were transferred to the Boston laboratory project. Benedict continued Atwater's work and used the respiration calorimeter to further measure metabolism and other bodily processes. Benedict studied the varying metabolism rates of infants born in two hospitals in Massachusetts, athletes, students, vegetarians, Mayans living in the Yucat√°n, and normal adults. He even developed a calorimeter large enough to hold twelve girl scouts for an extended period of time. His biggest improvement was the invention of portable field respiration calorimeters. In 1919, Francis Benedict published a metabolic standards report with extensive tables based on age, sex, height, and weight. Atwater's legacy endures not only in the field of nutrition but also in the work of the agricultural experiment stations. Both he and Johnson are considered responsible for focusing the role of the experiment stations on scientific study in service of the public and the tables and formulas Atwater created through his research are still in use today. \\"His careful studies of nutrition and those that followed helped spur federal policies that have done much to alleviate childhood hunger. We see reflections of his influence on the labels of products in our grocery stores, and we‚Äôre beginning to see nutritional information on the menus of restaurants. Today‚Äôs familiar food pyramid, a quick and easy visual guide to the recommended daily intake of food, is a tribute to Atwater and his successors.\\" Atwater's daughter, Helen W. Atwater, served as one of his laboratory assistants, namely assisting with manuscript preparation. She served as an editorial assistant in the Office of Experiment Stations from 1898 to 1903; she went on to have a career as a home economics specialist and served as the first full time editor of the Journal of Home Economics. His granddaughter, Catherine Merriam Atwater, the daughter of his son, Charles, was an author whom married economist John Kenneth Galbraith.Lawrence, J. M. \\"Catherine Galbraith, at 95; transformed economist-husband's life and career\\", The Boston Globe, October 4, 2008. Atwater's legacy is acknowledged through the yearly W.O. Atwater Memorial Lecture, sponsored through the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. Each year, a scientist is recognized for their unique contribution toward improving diet and nutrition globally. Atwater and his family's papers are held across multiple institutions, and the collections are, for the most part related to the holding institution. *Atwater Family Papers, 1778-2003 at Special Collections and Archives, Olin Library, Wesleyan University **Subset Atwater Family Papers, 1843-1943 at Special Collections and Archives, Wesleyan University **Wilbur Olin Atwater Papers, 1869-1915 at Special Collections and Archives, Wesleyan University *Wilbur Olin Atwater Papers at Special Collections of United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Library **Images from the Wilbur Olin Atwater Papers *Wilbur Olin Atwater papers, 1869-[ca.1914], Collection Number: 2223, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library *Wilbur Olin Atwater Papers, circa 1883-1889, Smithsonian Institution Archives The Wilbur O.

Because the pass is very narrow like a river, the ferries pass extremely close to its shores. It is also used by pleasure craft, fishing boats, freighters and freight ferries, making it very 'active' commercially as well.

She reappeared on February 26, 2010 until April 13, 2010. She escaped Statesville and returned to Llanview during the blackout on January 5, 2012 and remained until the broadcast finale January 13, 2012. Under secrecy, Garrick returned for the first-season finale of Prospect Park's version of One Life to Live on August 19, 2013. Impact The character of Allison became a key player in the 1986 Mitch Laurence storyline during a season in which the series rose from No. 4 to No. 3 in the Nielsen ratings. Villain Laurence wreaks havoc in fictional Llanview and seeks to exact his revenge on long-running One Life to Live heroine Viki Lord Buchanan; his death does not end his reign of terror, as disciple Allison kidnaps Viki's newborn daughter Jessica but ultimately returns her. Garrick returned as Allison in 2001 for what Soap Opera Weekly called \\"The Mother Of All Reveals,\\" a storyline in which the series exploited a loophole in its continuity and created a secret history that would \\"resonate for months and years.\\" The reveal that teenage Jessica had actually been switched with another baby by Allison in 1986 ‚Äì and so was not the daughter of Viki and husband Clint Buchanan ‚Äì \\"was about as big as they come.\\" When Gary Tomlin became Executive Producer of One Life to Live in January 2001, his familiarity with the series and its characters ‚Äì from his stint as director from 1992 to 1995 ‚Äì \\"manifested itself in ... the utilization of the show's rich history.\\" At the time he noted that the return of Allison Perkins \\"invigorates the Viki storyline, and [Allison] kidnapped Jessica, so there's a history there.\\" Tomlin explained how then-Head Writers Christopher Whitesell and Lorraine Broderick had thought, \\"OK, where can we do something where we do bring back that history but also explore something that's going to affect the future of this show?\\" He added that One Life to Live had been \\"so fortunate to get Barbara Garrick, who played the role originally, because we used those flashbacks from 13, 14 years ago. It's a treat for the audience that has invested in the show for that long, and the audience that doesn't know the story and gets to see what happened and realize, 'Oh my god, this is real. This isn't something they're making up.'\\" Storylines =1986‚Äì87= While a volunteer at Llanview Hospital in 1986, shy Allison Perkins takes an interest in young intern Dr. Dan Wolek, son of Dr. Larry Wolek and his deceased wife Meredith Lord. The two date, but nothing comes of it. The sheltered daughter of the warden of Stateville Prison, Allison soon falls under the spell of charismatic Mitch Laurence, who is incarcerated for the murder of Harry O'Neill. Pretending that he has \\"found God,\\" evil Mitch is released from prison and returns to Llanview as an evangelist. Still up to his old tricks, Mitch assembles his own commune at the Waterside Inn, coercing and drugging young women into being his disciples. Allison, Viki Buchanan's niece Mari Lynn Dennison and even Harry O'Neill's daughter Joy are seduced into Mitch's cult. Enacting his vendetta against Viki, whom he blames for the failure of his past schemes, Mitch programs Allison to do his bidding. A pregnant Viki visits the commune, and Allison drugs her; on the way home, Viki has an accident and goes into premature labor. Mitch is killed by Dorian Lord as he tries to rape her drugged daughter Cassie; Viki gives birth to baby Jessica on September 23, 1986. Disguised as Niki Smith, Allison kidnaps Jessica (1986) Compelled by Mitch's brainwashing, Allison puts his final plan into action. Putting on a red wig and flashy dress to look like Viki's former alternate personality Niki Smith, Allison sneaks into Viki's mansion, Llanfair, and kidnaps Jessica while Viki is asleep. Allison leaves the baby in the care of her mother Ruth in New Jersey, the older woman unaware of the child's origins. As the search for Jessica commences, Viki denies the suggestion that she had stolen the child as Niki. Maria Roberts, the old flame of Viki's husband Clint Buchanan, had already been plotting to separate Viki and Clint and take him for herself; Maria discovers Allison's involvement, and manipulates the situation further so that Clint begins to believe that Niki is the kidnapper after all. When Maria is later sure she has ruined Clint and Viki's marriage, she persuades Allison to return Jessica. Allison does, but is subsequently hit by a car and falls into a coma before she can tell anyone about Maria's scheming. =2001‚Äì03= In 2001, Allison reappears in Llanview at St. Ann's mental institution. Sane and remorseful, Allison tells her new psychologist, Dr. Rae Cummings, that she is desperate for Viki's forgiveness. A close friend of Viki's, Rae urges her to visit Allison; Viki's husband Ben Davidson, however, is suspicious and recommends against it. A compassionate Viki meets with and forgives a grateful Allison. But Ben soon hears Allison say \\"Viki forgave me. It's all set.\\" to someone on the phone; he decides to infiltrate St. Ann's, posing as mental patient \\"Dave\\" to gain Allison's confidence. Allison begins falling in love with \\"Dave,\\" but before Ben can learn what she is up to, Rae arranges for a \\"rehabilitated\\" Allison to leave the institution for good. Yet Allison has indeed been faking her remorse to fool Rae and get Viki's \\"inadvertent endorsement,\\" thereby securing her release from St. Ann's. A free woman, Allison can now reveal the most shocking part of Mitch's original plan. Allison seeks out her secret accomplice, Jessica's new friend Natalie Balsom, who has ingratiated herself to Jessica and her family in the short time since she had arrived in Llanview. Allison herself had tracked Natalie down and lured her to town; now having secured the genetic proof they need, Natalie and Allison confront Viki with a devastating announcement: Natalie is Clint and Viki's biological daughter. Allison is delighted to reveal that when she had kidnapped the Buchanan baby in 1986, she had returned another child who grew up to be Jessica. Their biological daughter ‚Äì Natalie ‚Äì had been raised by another family in relative squalor. Viki cannot believe she could have mistaken another child for her own, and worst of all, she despises the scheming Natalie and wants nothing to do with her. Viki declares Jessica \\"her one and only daughter,\\" but Allison has papers drawn up that give Natalie the legal right to live at Llanfair. As Natalie forcibly moves in, she and Allison make life as difficult as they can for Viki and Ben. Natalie desperately wants the money she \\"deserves\\" and the life that Jessica has \\"stolen\\" from her; once Natalie has access to her inheritance, she has agreed to share it with Allison. A troubled Jessica begins a tenuous relationship with Natalie's wild mother Roxy Balsom, whom she believes to be her mother, and with Roxy's biological son Rex. Forging a shaky relationship with Viki and seeing Allison's greed and questionable sanity, Natalie cuts Allison loose in early 2002. Looking for cash, Allison soon convinces Roxy to pretend to be suffering from hypoglycemia. Preying on Jessica's kindness and na√Øvet√©, they hope to get money from wealthy Jessica to pay for Roxy's expensive \\"treatments,\\" and then leave town. Jessica's boyfriend Seth Anderson ‚Äì who had come to Llanview as Natalie's lover and accomplice but had fallen for Jessica ‚Äì discovers the scheme and tells Jessica. Allison runs Seth and Jessica off the road in her car to stop them from telling the police; she frames Roxy for the accident, leaves Seth and Jessica for dead and flees Llanview. Allison returns after discovering that Jessica intends to give Roxy $100,000. Demanding her \\"rightful\\" share of the money from Roxy, Allison admits that she had run Seth and Jessica off the road. The police having bugged Roxy without her knowledge, Allison is overheard, arrested, and sent to Statesville Prison for 20 years in the summer of 2002. Allison becomes the cellmate of Lindsay Rappaport, who soon discovers that as the former warden's daughter, Allison knows of a secret tunnel out of the prison. Lindsay tries to convince Allison to escape with her, but Allison ‚Äì well-treated by the guards and other inmates and with \\"nothing waiting for her on the outside\\" ‚Äì is content to stay incarcerated. While blackmailing R.J. Gannon into aiding her breakout, Lindsay tells Allison that \\"Dave\\" needs her help. Lindsay and Allison escape through the tunnel, and are met and sheltered by R.J. at Rae Cummings' empty house. Meanwhile, the pressure of Natalie's appearance had triggered the return of Viki's alternate personality, Niki Smith. Desperate for her freedom, Niki pushes Ben out of a window and frames Natalie. Losing her fragile grip on reality, an increasingly violent Allison takes Roxy and then Niki hostage, intending to kill them. Leaving Roxy behind, Allison ends up taking Lindsay and Niki to the Buchanan lodge at gunpoint. About to kill one or the other, Allison is interrupted by the arrival of Police Commissioner Bo Buchanan, officer Antonio Vega and Viki's husband Ben. Allison is subdued, but while saving Viki, Antonio accidentally shoots Ben, which leaves him in a coma that ultimately leads to his death in 2004. A completely demented Allison is placed in a padded room at St. Ann's. In October 2002, a DNA test on Jessica proves that she is also Viki's daughter; Viki is shocked that she could possibly have given birth to twins. With all of Viki's delivery rooms nurses from 1986 dead, she and Bo visit Allison at St. Ann's. Viki asks Allison about the births and the kidnapping; a near-catatonic Allison tells Viki to \\"ask Mitch,\\" just as a very-much-alive Mitch Laurence befriends Natalie, using the name \\"Michael Lazarus.\\" Bo and Viki wonder what Allison means, and how Mitch might have been involved with the events surrounding Natalie and Jessica's births. Bo is disturbed when Allison questions if Mitch is really dead. It is ultimately revealed that Mitch Laurence had secretly raped a drugged Viki around the same time she conceived a child with Clint. Viki had unknowingly become pregnant with fraternal twins, one fathered by Clint (Natalie) and the other fathered by Mitch (Jessica). Viki's obstetrician Dr. Walter Balsom, who had been one of religious leader Mitch's disciples, had taken Mitch's daughter during delivery, and Viki had never known she had given birth to more than one child. Mitch, however, had wanted his daughter to grow up loved by Viki in the lap of luxury, and had sent Allison to kidnap Clint's child. They had replaced her with Mitch's daughter (who would become Jessica), and had given Clint's daughter (who would become Natalie) to Dr. Balsom and his wife Roxy. In early 2003, Mitch visits Allison at St. Ann's. Though Allison is \\"insane and incoherent,\\" Mitch orders her to pull herself together and indicates that they still have more to accomplish. =2008= Barbara Garrick as Allison Perkins (2008) \\"I know something you don't know...\\" Jessica had suffered her own bout with dissociative identity disorder from 2005 to 2006. Though not genetic, it had been explained that the illness had been triggered by childhood sexual abuse inflicted on Jessica while Viki had been running around as Niki Smith. In 2008, a recovered Jessica pretends to be her alter, \\"Tess,\\" to gain the trust of schemer Jared Banks, who had crossed paths with Tess in the past. Jared contacts St. Ann's, however, and Jessica is committed ‚Äì per her own past instructions ‚Äì on the suspicion that Tess has indeed taken over again. As Jessica waits for her husband Nash Brennan and Viki to arrange her release on January 25, 2008, she is spotted by fellow patient Allison. Allison rushes up to Jessica and giggles, \\"I know something you don't know.\\" She tells a doubtful Jessica that she has a big secret about Jessica's family. With Jessica's interest piqued, Allison makes a deal to tell Jessica what she knows ‚Äì if Jessica breaks her out of St. Ann's. Jessica soon enlists Natalie's aid, telling her shocked sister that she plans to sneak Allison out of the sanitarium. Dressed as nuns, Jessica and Natalie smuggle Allison out of St. Ann's with every intention of returning her when they have heard her secret; Allison muses on the humor in the fact that now they are \\"absconding\\" with her in the night. Allison insists on an assurance of her total freedom before she will say anything. Promising to leave their family alone once she has revealed her secret, Allison leads the sisters to a familiar place where she can \\"show\\" them what she knows: the mausoleum on the grounds of Llanfair where their evil grandfather Victor Lord lies. Jessica locks Allison in, hoping to force her to reveal what she knows; undaunted, Allison opens a secret panel in the mausoleum and, thanking Mitch, takes out a wrapped package ‚Äì and a gun. By morning, Jessica and Natalie find that Allison has escaped. Allison finds refuge with a reluctant Roxy, soon going to the Valentine's Day \\"Go Red Ball\\" and holding Jessica at gunpoint. Jared Banks throws himself in front of Jessica, and in a struggle for the gun he and Allison fall over a high balcony; hanging for their lives, Allison defiantly lets herself fall rather than return to St. Ann's, gloating to Jessica that her secret will die with her. Jared is saved and Allison's fall is broken by an awning, leaving her alive but in critical condition. She opens her eyes for a moment on February 29, 2008, but remains comatose. =2010= A presumed-dead Mitch Laurence turns up alive and begins terrorizing the residents of Llanview on November 9, 2009. He blackmails Dorian Lord by threatening her family, and is furious when she ultimately betrays him. On February 26, 2010, Allison appears at Statesville Prison dressed as Roxy to visit Mitch, telling him that Dorian's sister Melinda Cramer had died. =2012= Allison escapes from Statesville Prison during the blackout in January 2012. She reappears on January 5, sneaking into Llanfair to see Viki and Clint. She confesses to them that she is no longer following Mitch and that she caused the prison break. Allison also begins hinting about Jessica and Natalie's paternity. On January 6, Allison tells Clint and Viki the truth: Jessica and Natalie are both Clint's biological daughters, and she had lied to Mitch that one baby was his to please him. She then shoots Viki and runs off. On January 13, Allison narrates the last episode of One Life to Live from an unknown room. She tells the life stories of Viki and Clint, and hints at the future that others in Llanview might have. Allison ends the episode by saying \\"But why spoil what happens next? You of all people should know things are rarely what they appear\\" and throws the script she wrote for the last episode at a man who is tied to the bed of the room she is in: Viki's brother Victor Lord, Jr., who is very much alive. =2013= In the One life to Live online series on May 1, Victor Jr. reappears in Llanview, having at some point escaped from Allison, but then being held prisoner by an evil organization. On August 12, it is revealed that the head of this organization, Carl Peterson, is Alison's brother. Victor leaves town to protect his family but is recaptured by Allison. Carl had a vendetta against Viki and Clint's families, and part of his plan has been to drug Clint so that he acts irrationally. As a result, Clint has a violent public meltdown and is hospitalized. On the first-season finale episode of OLTL 2.0 on August 19, a horrified Natalie finds Allison at Llanview Hospital at Clint's bedside. Laughing, she injects a syringe into Clint's arm as he gasps for air, and Natalie screams.

Torchitorio de Zori (also spelled Torcotor(e)(io) or (T)(D)orgodorio, and also de Thori; died before 1113) is the earliest Judge of Gallura known with certainty and attested by contemporary sources. He lived in the late 11th century at a time when Sardinia was entering the wider Western European scene for the first time in centuries. Like his contemporary judges, he patronised Western monasticism. His most enduring work was the building of a new church in Civita (modern Olbia), where he made his capital, in honour of Saint Simplicius, a sixth- century bishop and martyr of the city. Torchitorio also invited monks from Saint-Victor at Marseilles to come to Gallura in 1089, in imitation of his contemporary Torchitorio I of Cagliari. He granted the new monks four churches and they in turn opened up new lines of intellectual and economic interchange with Provence. Sometime after 1092,Manno, 244 n702, based on a preserved letter of a Gallurese monk, John, to Richard, Cardinal-Abbot of Saint-Victor and its reference to an archbishop. The diocese of Pisa was only raised to archiepiscopal status in 1092. however, Torchitorio fell out with the church. Dagobert, Archbishop of Pisa and papal legate to the island, convoked a provincial synod at Porto Torres and declared Torthictorio excommunicate. The purpose of the anathema may have been less the result of the judge's vices, but more of his political support for the Emperor Henry IV and the Antipope Guibert. Evidence for this is suggested by the anathema pronounced on the entire province. Torchitorio's retainers reportedly denied him the kiss of peace and the brotherly salute.Manno, 244. He was dead by 1113, when his widow, Paulesa (Padulesa) de Gunale, made a donation to S. Maria di Pisa. The evidence after his death is that Ittocorre de Gunale usurped the throne from his son Saltaro. The Gunale and Thori families were ancient enemies only kept at peace during the marriage of Torchitorio and Padulesa. He probably also left a daughter who married Constantine Spanu.

In 2002, the stadium's track was completely rebuilt. In 2003, it was named the Fred Hardy Track in honor of the longtime Spiders coach. The playing surface was changed from natural grass to FieldTurf, an artificial turf, in 2004. Due to the age and off-campus location of City Stadium, where the Richmond Spiders football team played its home games, demand grew for an on-campus football facility. The university and donors committed more than $25 million to a renovation of First Market Stadium, including a $5 million grant from the Robins Foundation in early 2008. Renovations on the stadium began on December 20, 2008, coincidentally the day after the Spiders football team won the 2008 NCAA Division I Football Championship ‚Äì the school's first national title in any sport. On September 16, 2009, the stadium was renamed E. Claiborne Robins Stadium to honor the legacy of E. Claiborne Robins Sr and his historic philanthropy to the school. The football team began play at Robins Stadium in the 2010 season, they won their first game 27-21 in overtime over Elon University.

The gardens, once a place for the wealthy to 'take the air' and 'be seen', are found in the centre of the town on the Parade, with the River Leam flowing to the south of them. One of the town's most popular tourist attractions, they have facilities such as cafes and floral displays. The gardens are often marketed in tandem with the nearby all-grassed Mill Gardens on the south side of the river. The gardens have a total area of with Mill Gardens and its boating lake, both on the opposite side of the river, providing an extra .  History  The gardens began as farmland which belonged to Edward Willes, a member of the Willes family who played an important part in the shaping of early Leamington. The original gardens, covering just under , were laid out in 1834 at the request of the landowner with free entry to anyone between 7 am and 10 am. For the remainder of the day the gardens were open only to paying customers and patrons of a nearby spa bath house. The gardens were soon expanded to their current size and a right of way passing through them was sunk down so it could be used without walking through the gardens. In 1836, two years after starting the project, Willes leased the land to a local consortium for ¬£30 a year.Bird, Vivian: Warwickshire, page 109. Batsford, 1973 In 1843, the gardens were improved, the ground being levelled and an ornamental lake being excavated. In 1846 a local committee meeting declared that the gardens be renamed The Jephson Gardens in honour of Dr Henry Jephson who had helped to promote the healing properties of the town's spa waters and built houses for the town's poor residents. A Corinthian-style temple was added to the gardens in 1849 and inside it a large marble statue of the doctor by the Birmingham sculptor Peter Hollins.Bird, Vivian: Warwickshire, page 110. Batsford, 1973 Most of this early work was undertaken by poor labourers, given employment by another of the town's early philanthropists, Dr Hitchman. In 1869, Hitchman received recognition of his efforts when a fountain bearing his name was erected in the gardens, near the boundary with the town's main street. This was followed in 1875 by a grey granite obelisk memorial to Edward WillesNicholson, Jean et al: The Obelisks of Warwickshire, page 38. Brewin Books, 2013 and in 1925 by a clock tower dedicated to Alderman William Davis, who was mayor of the town three times. All four memorials still stand today. The twentieth century saw yet more development in the park. Tea rooms were opened in the centre of the gardens in 1899 and were later used as an aviary. From 1901 to 1903, Mill Gardens, Mill Bridge and the boathouse were developed. The year 1926 saw two further additions to the gardens. The first was a clock tower in the eastern half of the gardens and the second was a fountain for the lake. A second fountain was added in 1927. The two fountains were based on the fountains at Hampton Court. Czech Memorial Fountain In those early years, the attractions of the park were just as strong as today, perhaps more so. There were flower shows which drew entrants from all over England, firework and fairy light displays, balloon ascents and band concerts. Archery and croquet, as well as boating, were two sports allowed in the gardens. There were also tennis courts in the park from 1878 to 1942, when the courts were removed during the Dig for Victory campaign of the Second World War. A lasting connection that the gardens have to the war is the Czech Memorial Fountain, unveiled in 1968. Its purpose is to honour those who served in the Czech Free Army, which was based in the town, especially seven men who were parachuted into Czechoslovakia for the assassination attempt, Operation Anthropoid, on Nazi general Reinhard Heydrich. The fountain was restored in 2018 and given Grade II listed status in July 2018. Funding and redevelopment Since the end of the Second World War, investment in the gardens had fallen and the task of running them had passed to the Warwick District Council rather than private individuals. In the 1990s, many people felt that the gardens had lost their shine. For this reason the council began major work on the gardens in 1999 and eventually won a ¬£3 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. One of the first jobs to be completed was the removal of a children's play area by the river which was looking outdated. It was replaced by a new one in Mill Gardens near the boathouse. The aviary, which had long been disused, was turned into a cafe, and the Czech War and Jephson memorials were given a well-needed clean. The flagship development however was a sub-tropical glasshouse which contains exotic plant life, The Restaurant In The Park (which replaced an old restaurant by the old children's play area) and a teaching studio used by Warwickshire College students. In addition to these the public toilets were upgraded, the paths were resurfaced and a sensory garden was created. In 2010, the Grade II listed building, East Lodge, at the Willes Road entrance to the park, originally built in 1846/7, was redeveloped into a sustainability visitor centre. Recognition The investment in the gardens has proved to be worthwhile as they were voted, along with Mill Gardens, \\"Best Park in Britain 2004\\" by the Royal Horticultural Society. In 2006, the gardens won its first Green Flag award. It has won again every year until present, 2018, making 12 consecutive years. It has been voted a Green Heritage Site by English Heritage. There are also a number of Grade II listed buildings in the gardens. Popular culture The 1970 \\"Black Sabbath\\" World Tour in support of the \\"Black Sabbath\\" album included a date at the Jephson Gardens Pavilion on 17 May 1970. The Jephson Memorial was featured on the cover of the Ocean Colour Scene album Moseley Shoals,Purplerevolver.com's review of the album's re-issue and the park's underpass was found on The Shapes, Songs For Sensible People. In September 2010 scenes for a BBC re-make of the TV series Upstairs, Downstairs were shot in the park.. In May 2016 the park was used as the location for the Great Day in Leamington Spa photograph featuring 92 local musicians.

A party's leverage is based on its ability to award benefits or impose costs on the other side. Another conceptualization holds that the party that has the most to lose from a \\"no deal\\" outcome has less leverage than the party that has the least to lose. Leverage has been described as \\"negotiation's prime mover,\\" indicating its important role in bargaining and negotiation situations. Individuals with strong leverage can sometimes overcome weak negotiating skills, whereas those with poor leverage have a reduced likelihood of being successful even if they have strong negotiating skills.  Bargaining power  It is said that those that one has discretion over can provide leverage and this can be demonstrated in the way advertising time sellers have bargaining power at holiday time or television shows if their advertisement slots are full. In order for a negotiating side's leverage to work in their favor, the threats or promises they put forth must be perceived as credible by the opposing group. This does not mean that the threats and promises have to be based in facts, but the opposing group must believe that a specific threat or promise can be carried out and that it would make them better or worse off compared to the other side. Leverage can be measured qualitatively in terms of how much one side has to lose from not coming to an agreement. Generally, the side or group that is most in need of an agreement has the least amount of leverage. The side or group that is willing to walk away (when this is a possibility) has the most amount of leverage. A key aspect of leverage is that it is a dynamic rather than a static factor. This means that it can change as more information is gathered or the situation evolves. A hostage situation is a prime example of how leverage can be dynamic. Early on in a hostage situation, control is held by the hostage takers; they have the greatest leverage: the lives of their hostages. However, as the situation evolves, effective hostage negotiators can gain leverage, take control, and eventually free the hostages. Here, the fear of \\"no deal\\" can shift back and forth between the participants so that leverage changes moment by moment.  Types of leverage  There are three types of leverage: positive leverage, negative leverage, and normative leverage. =Positive leverage= Positive leverage is a negotiator's ability to provide things that his or her opponent wants. Positive leverage is based in the ability of one party to satisfy the needs of another party. The power from positive leverage comes from the opportunity to provide or withhold the needed item or action. The strength of this type of leverage is determined by the other alternatives available to the opposition (often referred to as the \\"BATNA\\" or the best alternative to a negotiated agreement). If there are others who can also fulfill the opposition's needs, then the leverage is weakened since the opposition can go elsewhere to receive what they need. In politics, an example of positive leverage is logrolling, or vote trading. Legislators will promise to vote the way that another legislator wants on one issue in order to gain their opponent's vote on another issue. =Negative leverage= Negative leverage is a threat-based form of leverage that represents one side's ability to make the other side worse off. The power of negative leverage relies on loss aversion. Because potential losses are seen as worse than equivalent gains, negative leverage can be very powerful. However, it can also bring out strong reactions from the opposing party, straining the relationship. Neither party's interests are advanced by negative leverage except for the gain that the party employing the leverage may get towards their ultimate desired outcome from the negotiation. Picketing in labor negotiations is an example of negative leverage. The goal of picketing is to attract negative attention to the employer, but the employees do not gain any material benefits from the act of picketing itself. = Normative leverage = Normative leverage relies on using social standards or norms to encourage consensus. It draws from the principle of consistency, using such standards and norms as well as coherent positioning to advance or protect a position. This type of leverage is maximized when the negotiating groups agree on these social standards or norms and see them as relevant to the discussion at hand. Normative leverage stems from people's desire to be consistent and reasonable in their decision-making. An example of normative leverage would be for one party to appeal to another's religious or moral standards as grounds for acting in a certain way. Richard Shell refers to the Hanafi hostage situation as an example of using normative leverage in his book on bargaining and negotiation. Hostage negotiators read from and discussed the Koran (or Quran) with the hostage takers in order to encourage the peaceful release of remaining hostages.  Improving leverage  Since leverage changes over the course of a negotiation, a party's leverage can be improved through a number of ways. = Creating coalitions = Forming a coalition with other parties during a negotiation can increase the amount of leverage that group has over opposition. The improved leverage is a result of group dynamics which often favor the group with the largest membership. Studies in social psychology have found that individuals will often conform to the beliefs of the larger group. = Gathering more information = As a negotiation moves forward, each party learns more about what the other side wants, its priorities, and its vulnerabilities. This information can shape the threats and promises that each side can make, as well as their weight. Gathering information about the opposition and limiting the release of information about your position can help a party gain or maintain leverage. = Time = Time can be a key factor in a negotiation. The party with the most patience and ability to wait has greater leverage. As time moves forward, leverage can shift if one group needs to come to a resolution sooner than the other. Transportation workers, for example, can use time to their advantage by conducting last minute strikes that put increased pressure on their employer to settle labor disputes in order to be able to fulfill their obligations to their customers.  Coercion  If leverage is abused it can lead to coercion. This happens most often with the use of negative leverage. The improper use of negative leverage can put the opposing party in duress, leading them to make decisions that they normally would not if they had free will. Abuse of positive leverage can also lead to coercion, including bribery and blackmail.

History A carnival mask Domino masks are worn during Carnival, e.g. at the Venetian Carnival, where it was the part of the more extensive black (though occasionally white and blue) domino costume worn by both male and female participants, which accomplished the requirement of the masquerade that participants be masked or otherwise disguised, and achieved the elements of adventure, conspiracy, intrigue, and mystery that were distinctives of the masquerade atmosphere; the costume included the mask, as well as a cloak to envelope the body, and sometimes a hood (bahoo).Aileen Ribiero, 1984, The Dress Worn at Masquerades in England 1730 to 1790 (New York, NY:Garland Published), pp. 3, 29.Terry Castle, 1986, Masquerade and Civilization: the Carnivalesque in Eighteenth-Century English Culture and Fiction (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press), p. 59.

WZID is located on Commercial Street in Manchester, New Hampshire. Its signal can be heard as far south as the Massachusetts Turnpike, as far east as southern Maine and as far west as Vermont. WZID also broadcasts in HD Radio. History The station was born October 2, 1947 as WKBR-FM. Throughout the 1960s, and very early 1970s, WKBR-FM simulcasted the top 40 format of WKBR 1250 (now WGAM), providing that station with significant extended coverage. In July 1971, WKBR-FM became WZID, and the format was flipped to beautiful music. In the 1980s, instrumental easy listening music was scaled back, with soft vocal hits added, to the point where the station evolved into an adult contemporary station. In October 1990, Sunshine Broadcasting of New Hampshire Inc. announced the sale of WZID and 1370 WFEA (AM) to Saga Communications Inc. of Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. The sale was finalized April 16, 1991. Saga Communications of New England LLC operates the station today. WZID's President and General Manager is Bob Cox. Translators Former logo for WZID-HD2, used from January 2009 until the split of FM translator W276BJ 103.1 FM Concord on February 1, 2017 to simulcast WZID-HD3 \\"103.1 The Outlaw\\". WZID used to be heard on translator station, W270AH 101.9 in Peterborough, New Hampshire. However in 2008, Saga Communications filed a series of minor translator applications which moved the translator into the Keene radio market as W276CB, a translator of Saga radio station WKNE's HD3 channel as \\"Kool 103.1\\" (now WINQ-FM's HD2 channel as \\"WINK Classic Country 103.1FM\\"). Up until mid-January 2009, WZID had two more translators, W231BR 94.1 in Manchester at 250 watts and W276BJ 103.1 in Concord, also at 250 watts, but in January 2009 those two translators were turned into the new \\"Hot Hits 94.1 and 103.1\\", a simulcast of WZID's HD2 channel, which is a top 40 station broadcasting Dial Global's Hits Now! format; branding themselves as the new hit music station in New Hampshire. Saga Communications obviously had been planning this out for some time because both the translator's power was recently increased from low power to 250 watts. This station was a direct competitor to Manchester‚Äôs heritage CHR 105.5 WJYY, but had an inferior signal compared to it. Saga was able to open up this new station due to a loophole in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules that allows HD sub-channel stations to be repeated on translators. On December 11, 2013, Hot Hits had short-lived intentions of increasing the HAAT of W231BR up to 270 meters to provide significant coverage improvements to the Keene, Portsmouth and Lowell areas; however, this signal upgrade had never occurred. On August 18, 2014, WZID was granted permission to implement W231BR's current HAAT of (although the ERP of the translator would remain at 250 Watts), to improve W231BR's coverage of surrounding communities (such as Keene, Portsmouth and Lowell), although to a somewhat lesser extent of signal improvement than originally contemplated back in late 2013. Beginning in mid July 2015, WZID began simulcasting sister station WFEA on its HD3 channel which in turn is broadcast on newly purchased 110-watt translator W260CF serving the greater Manchester area from its tower on Mt. Uncanoonuc in Goffstown at 99.9 FM. On February 1, 2017 WZID's HD3 sub channel changed their format from the WFEA simulcast to classic country, branded as \\"103.1 The Outlaw\\", as it replaced \\"Hot Hits\\" on W276BJ 103.1 FM in Concord.Saga Brings Outlaw to New Hampshire Radioinsight - February 1, 2017 In January 2020, Saga acquired a second translator, W295BL 106.9 FM in Manchester, to carry \\"The Outlaw\\".

View north from the Portland stone bridge, showing the river Wandle passing through an artificial channel. The Grove house can just be seen to the right. The Grove Park, or The Grove is a public park in Carshalton in the London Borough of Sutton. It is situated close to Carshalton Village in the area approximately bounded by the High Street, North Street and Mill Lane. The southwest corner of the park abuts one of Carshalton's ponds (Lower Pond) from where water flows through the park as the river Wandle. History The park land was in mediaeval times part of the manor of Stone Court, then consisting mainly of meadows. The manor house was situated at the corner of North Street and Mill Lane. The original Tudor house was re-built in about 1710; recently (2005) there was an archaeological investigation into the remains of this building. In the early 19th century a new house called The Grove was built on the other side of the river on higher ground and is the large house seen today. The remaining outbuildings of Stone Court were converted to what are now education department offices. The Grove, including the ornamental gardens, was bought by Carshalton Urban District Council in 1924 and the park was opened to the public several years later. Features of interest The Leoni Bridge =The Leoni Bridge= Where Grove Park meets the Lower Pond there is a white Portland stone bridge. This is sometimes referred to as the Leoni Bridge as it is conjectured that the Venetian architect Giacomo Leoni designed it. Leoni had been commissioned to design a new mansion for Carshalton Park during the early 18th century, but the mansion itself was never constructed.\\"Carshalton\\", The Environs of London volume 1: County of Surrey (1792), pp. 122‚Äì36.

Recreation To the east of The Grove House there are recreation grounds extending as far as the Westcroft Leisure Centre. There is an enclosed children's playground, miniature golf, cafeteria, ball court, bowling green and other facilities.

The company produced automobiles, karts and planes. Praga V3S was used by the Czechoslovak Army for more than half a century.Nesmrteln√° babiƒçka vejt≈ôaska slav√≠ ≈°edes√°tiny Praga R1 History Praga was founded in 1907 to build motor cars as a venture between entrepreneur Franti≈°ek Ringhoffer and the company 1. ƒçeskomoravsk√° tov√°rna na stroje (\\"First Bohemian-Moravian Machine Works\\", later a founding part of the ƒåKD factories). Ringhoffer only stayed for one year and in 1909 the trade name Praga (\\"Prague\\" in Latin) was adopted. One of its early models was built under licence from the Italian company of Isotta Fraschini. Praga also diversified into building engines and gearboxes for other applications such as aircraft and tanks. In 1929 Praga merged with ƒåKD, one of Czechoslovakia's largest engineering companies. In 1929 ƒåKD's BD motorcycle was re-branded under the Praga marque. This was an advanced four- stroke single-cylinder unit construction double overhead camshaft model of 500cc designed in 1927 by JF Koch. The \\"BD\\" designation was retained as its model name. Praga AlfaIn 1932 Praga added a second motorcycle model, the BC. This had a single overhead camshaft engine of 350cc, shaft drive and a pressed steel frame. Praga ended production of both motorcycle models in 1933. The factory was largely destroyed by air raids in 1945. After the Second World War it was rebuilt and resumed truck and bus construction. The firm was nationalized in October 1945. Passenger cars (only the mid-sized Lady) were also manufactured in small numbers until 1947, for use by government officials. The M53/59 Praga was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun developed in the late 1950s. It consists of a heavily modified Praga V3S 6 wheel drive truck chassis and twin 30 mm AA autocannon. In 2006, Praga was purchased by British International Truck Alliance with the intention to produce trucks with the name of Praga in Lublin, Poland. In 2007 it produces gearboxes and hydraulic machinery. In June 2011 the company unveiled at Dutch Supercar Challenge in Belgium, the new car Praga R4 with eight-cylinder engine of 520 hp, which has not been so far homologated for normal road traffic. According to company owner Petr Pt√°ƒçek, there will follow gradual steps, so new Praga cars will not be seen only at racetracks, but we could meet them in normal traffic. In 2016, the company plans first deliveries of supersport road cars Praga R1R, in a limited edition of 68 cars. It will be the first road car of Praga since 1947.

Its surface geology is undifferentiated till deposits. It is low-lying, mostly in a 100-year flood area, and contains a muskrat habitat. History upright Then known as one of the √Æles Sainte-Genevi√®ve (now Dowker, Madore, and Daoust), the island was granted to governor of Montreal Fran√ßois-Marie Perrot by Jean Talon, in 1672, along with the √Æle Perrot. It was acquired in 1897 by Leslie Rose Dowker (unknown-1945), who shortly afterward became Mayor of Sainte-Anne-du-Bout-de-l'√éle, now known as Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue. In the 1940s Pointe-Claire notary public Gerard Tardiff had a large summer house on the island. It is the site of a ruined stone house as well as a former navigational aid light. In older documents, as late as the 1966 topographic map of Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, it is named Lynch Island.

Her parents became Black Loyalists during the American Revolutionary War when they pledged to be loyal to the British Army in exchange for their freedom. At around the age of 10, Rose was among the approximately 3,000 Black Loyalists who sailed from New York City to Nova Scotia in 1783. She had at least three children and is thought to have been married twice. At about 50 years of age she began a business transporting luggage in a wheelbarrow from the Annapolis ferry docks to hotels and houses. By the early 1840s, she was using horse-drawn carriages to convey the luggage. She became the first female police officer in North America when she instituted and enforced curfews to keep the streets safe at night. Fortune is remembered for her business sense, strength, and courage. Early life Rose Fortune was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania about March 13, 1774, to her parents Fortune and Aminta, of African, Madagascarian, and South American descent. Run Away notice, April 29, 1773, Virginia Gazette regarding Fortune and Aminta A year before her birth, her parents were identified in a runaway slave advertisement in Virginia. Written in Petersburg, Virginia by William Bradley, the ad was published in the Virginia Gazette on April 29, 1773. Fortune and Aminta ran away on April 20. Fortune was thought to have been about 40 years of age (born about 1733), of a slim build, and about six feet tall. He left with warm clothing. Aminta appeared to be Native American with long black hair and around 30 years of age (born about 1743). Besides the clothes she was wearing, she ran away with a quilt. Bradley offered an award of three pounds. Fortune and Aminta were brought to Virginia from Rhode Island by Captain John Atkinson. Aminta's mother was said to have come to Rhode Island from the Spanish Main. It was thought that they might have returned to Rhode Island. They were believed to have been owned by members of the Devone family of Virginia. Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres, Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, 1781 During the American Revolutionary War, the British offered freedom to runaway slaves and free blacks if they provided their loyalty. Fortune's family were among the 3,000 Black Loyalists who supported the British during the war and at the end of the war were transported from New York to Nova Scotia, a British territory. In 1783, they relocated to Annapolis Royal, when she was 10 or more years old. She was enumerated under the column \\"child above ten\\" on the Annapolis County muster roll for her father Fortune in June 1784. Baptismal records of Rev. Roger Veits seem to indicate that Rose was living in Freeport, Long Island, Nova Scotia in the year 1795. Career St. George Street, Annapolis She started her own business when blacks and women were not encouraged to do so. Around 1825, Rose began carting passenger's luggage between the Saint John-Digby-Annapolis ferry docks and nearby homes and hotels. She also met ferries from Boston. She became a trusted figure for travellers, helping them find accommodation and ensuring they made their connections to schooners and steamships. In 1841, her business became known as Lewis Transfer and that year, or three years later, she used horse-drawn wagons to transport luggage. She woke up guests at inns so that they could meet their ferries on time. One of her regular customers was Thomas Chandler Haliburton, judge of the Supreme Court from 1841 to 1856, who she woke so that he could travel to Digby in time for court. She was well known by the town's leaders and she had limited competition due to her reputation. Her strength, trust, honesty and constant presence on the waterfront led her to become entrusted with safeguarding property and maintaining order on the wharves and warehouses of Annapolis Royal, acting as the town's waterfront police officer. For instance, she created and imposed curfews at the wharves to keep boys' behavior in order. She was the only person responsible for law and order in Annapolis for a time and is said to be the first female police officer on the American continent. She worked into her 70s. Personal life and death Fortune was married several times, as noted in the St. Luke's Church of England record books. She had two daughters and at least three children. One was Jane Fortune, who married Isaac Godfrey. Her son, John, married the sister of Isaac, Hester Godfrey, on January 13, 1838. Her daughter Margaret Fortune married John Francis of Digby by 1842. Fortune helped other blacks escape slavery on the Underground Railroad by leading runaways to locations that were safe. Rose Fortune's grave marker in the Garrison Cemetery In her later years, she had severe rheumatism and lived near the Union Bank. Rose Fortune died in Nova Scotia on February 20, 1864 at around the age of 90. Her funeral was held at St. Luke's, Church of England, Annapolis Royal. She was buried at the Royal Garrison cemetery at Fort Anne, where a special marker was created for her grave and installed on Canada Day in 2017. Created by sculptor Brad Hall, it uses a stylized wheelbarrow made of iron and stone to evoke her work and the business she founded on the waterfront. The wheelbarrow forms a memorial bench. Descendants The business she founded was continued by family for several generations as a stevedore and cartage company, later led by her grandson-in-law Albert Lewis as the Lewis Transfer Company, remaining in business until 1960 or 1980.Ian Lawrence, Historic Annapolis Royal, Halifax: Nimbus Publishing (2002), p. 26, 154 Albert was married to Fortune's granddaughter Amberzene Lewis. Her direct descendant, Daurene Lewis, was elected Mayor of Annapolis Royal in 1984, being the first African-Canadian woman in Canada to attain that position. Legacy When Black Loyalists, like Fortune, came to Nova Scotia they were subject to racial prejudice, barriers to opportunities, and economic marginalization, in which they did not receive pay commensurate with white people. She was also subject to physical threats as a woman. Fortune became a \\"respected and prominent member of the community\\" by making her own opportunities. Now she is known among the African-Canadian community for her strength and pride. The Rose Fortune Gate in Bedford, Nova Scotia is named after her. In 1999, a plaque in her honour was installed near the location of her house in the Petit Parc on the Annapolis Royal waterfront, part of the Mathieu da Coast heritage trail. In May 2015, Rose Fortune's first name was bestowed upon the new ferry, the to operate between Digby, Nova Scotia and Saint John, New Brunswick. Fortune was named a National Historic Person on January 12, 2018.Government of Canada Announces New National Historic Designations, Parks Canada news release, January 12, 2018 The plaque was installed by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada on July 20, 2019, at the waterfront of Annapolis Royal where Rose once worked. It is mounted on a granite boulder donated by Fred Bailey, one of Fortune's descendants, which came from the family's land in Lequille, just outside of Annapolis Royal. A scholarship, Peter Butler III‚ÄìRose Fortune Scholarship Program, was established by the Association of Black Law Enforcers in memory of the initial black police officers in Canada. In popular culture * Fortune, a play inspired by the life of Rose Fortune, written by playwright George Cameron Grant, has been performed through the United States and the Maritimes. Grant was inspired by a Candlelight Graveyard tour in 2013, led by Annapolis Royal historian Alan Melanson which featured the unmarked resting place of Rose Fortune. Grant resolved to write the play and start the campaign for the grave monument. * The film Rhythm Stick to Freedom is the story of her life.

It spans from an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) in downtown Marysville to a junction with SR 9\\\\. The highway primarily functions as a commuter route and uses two local streets: 4th Street and 64th Street. The corridor was added to the state system in 1937 as a branch of Primary State Highway 1 (PSH 1). During the 1964 state highway renumbering, this branch became SR 528, which had not been completed. The two disconnected sections of the highway were linked by a bridge over Allen Creek that opened in the 1980s. Route description SR 528 in downtown Marysville, looking east from Cedar Avenue SR 528 travels for entirely within the city of Marysville in northern Snohomish County. It begins at a diamond interchange with I-5 and Marine Drive near the city's border with the Tulalip Indian Reservation on the north side of Ebey Slough. The highway runs east into downtown Marysville on 4th Street, crossing over a section of the BNSF Railway (which also carries Amtrak's Cascades passenger trains) near Comeford Park and the city's landmark water tower. SR 528 then passes north of a shopping center and intersects State Avenue, the northernmost section of SR 529 and a former section of U.S. Route 99 (US 99). SR 529 continues south from Marysville over the Snohomish River delta to Everett and Naval Station Everett. The highway continues east on 4th Street and passes south of Asbery Field before crossing Allen Creek. After crossing the creek, SR 528 veers northeast onto 64th Street Northeast, returning to its due east course at the southeast corner of Jennings Memorial Park. The street passes through residential neighborhoods in eastern Marysville, along with the city's YMCA and a small shopping center at 67th Avenue. SR 528 then ascends a large hill and terminates at a signalized intersection with SR 9 near Lake Cassidy. Community Transit operates two bus routes on the SR 528 corridor: Route 209, which runs on the whole street and connects Marysville to Smokey Point and Lake Stevens; and Route 222, which uses a short section from 67th to 83rd avenues and connects Marysville to the Tulalip Indian Reservation. SR 528 is a suburban arterial with four lanes and continuous sidewalks. It is mainly used by commuter traffic within Marysville and traveling to I-5 and SR 9, becoming congested during rush hours as a result. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts an annual survey of traffic volumes on state highways measured in terms of average annual daily traffic. Traffic volumes on SR 528 range from a minimum of 14,000 vehicles at SR 9 to a maximum of 33,000 vehicles at the I-5 interchange. The westernmost section of SR 528 between I-5 and SR 528 is designated as a minor route of the National Highway System. History Marysville was established in 1878 and platted in 1885, including 4th Street as one of its principal streets. Initially, the only bridge across Allen Creek connected 3rd Street with Sunnyside Boulevard, forming part of the Pacific Highway until the completion of bridges over the Snohomish River in 1927. A trail used by Coast Salish peoples had existed between modern-day Marysville and Lake Stevens by the 19th century. When the Primary and Secondary Highways were created in 1937, the route of SR 528 became the Marysville branch of Primary State Highway 1. The highway ran from PSH 1 in Marysville to Secondary State Highway 1A (SSH 1A), although the road was not constructed at the time. PSH 1 MA became SR 528 in 1964 during the 1964 highway renumbering, which replaced the earlier system with new state routes. The highway remained split into two sections by Allen Creek, with 4th Street in downtown Marysville and 64th Street (Hickok Road) in eastern Marysville. A connection for SR 528 across Allen Creek was planned in the late 1960s by the state government and approved for construction in 1969, but not built until 1984. The state government also improved existing sections of 4th Street in the 1970s and constructed an extension of 64th Street Northeast to reach SR 9 in the 1980s. The I-5 interchange was expanded in the 1970s and rebuilt in 1993 with wider ramps and a new traffic signal, funded by a federal grant. A section of SR 528 from 64th Avenue Northeast to SR 9 was widened to four lanes in 2000. The project cost $4.8 million, largely funded by the state's Transportation Improvement Board, and was dedicated in November. A section of the highway was repaved by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) in September 2004. The eastern terminus at SR 9 was improved in 2008 through the addition of a traffic light, wider shoulders, and a left-turn lane. A HAWK signal was installed on SR 528 near Asbery Field to provide a pedestrian crossing. Since the 2000s, the Marysville city government has studied various projects that would ease traffic congestion on 4th Street. A new set of ramps are planned to be added to the SR 529 interchange south of Marysville to provide an alternative route for Marysville commuters, along with an extension of 1st Street to 47th Avenue that is scheduled to open in 2022.

On December 16, 1914, he flew a Burgess Model I seaplane with 1st Lt. Joseph O. Mauborgne of the Signal Corps as his radio operator, making the first two-way communication by radio telegraphy between a ground station and an airplane in flight. The next month he crashed his airplane into San Jose Bay off Corregidor, temporarily ending aviation in the Philippines, and was sent back to the Signal Corps Aviation School at North Field, San Diego, California. From March to July 1916, he was a member of the 1st Aero Squadron when it supported the Pancho Villa Expedition in Mexico. In 1926 he aided in drafting the legislation that became the Air Corps Act, which led to the establishment of the United States Army Air Corps.Golden Legacy, Boundless Future: Essays on the United States Air Force and the Rise of Aerospace Power, edited by Rebecca H.

In 1934, he became the assistant commander of the Air Corps Tactical School. From 1938 to 1940, he commanded the 19th Composite Wing in the Panama Canal Zone. He returned to the United States in 1940 to become Assistant Chief of the Army Air Corps. The following year, he took command of the First Air Force. In the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Henry Stimson chose Dargue to lead the investigation of why the United States had been unprepared for the attack, and placed him in command of the US Army units there.Air Warfare: An International Encyclopedia, Volume 1, by Walter J.

A birth attendant, who may be a midwife, physician, obstetrician, or nurse, is trained to be present at (\\"attend\\") childbirth, whether the delivery takes place in a health care institution or at home, to recognize and respond appropriately to medical complications, and to implement interventions to help prevent them in the first place, including through prenatal care.World Health Organization. 2002. Global action for skilled attendants for pregnant women. http://www.who.int/making_pregnancy_safer/documents/who_fch_rhr_0203/en/index.html Different birth attendants are able to provide different levels of care. Types of midwives There are three different types of midwives. There is a nurse-midwife who must obtain a high level of education, either bachelors or masters in midwifery, after becoming a nurse. Nurse-midwives can serve in most birthing centers, hospitals, and can have a private home birth practice. Then there is a Certified Professional Midwife. This midwife can obtain a license by following an apprenticeship/internship style of learning, along with other certifications. She must pass a board exam through states/countries that allow for this license and can only be available in a home birth setting. Lastly there are Direct Entry Midwives. These midwives are trained through an apprenticeship/internship process and are only allowed in home birth settings as well. They do not hold a professional license but rather serve as lay midwives wherever they are needed.https://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/maternal/skilled_birth/en/ Birth attendant versus birth assistant A distinction must be made between \\"birth attendant\\" and others who may provide support and care during pregnancy and childbirth, based on professional training and skills, practice regulations, as well as nature of care delivered. Birth attendants are typically trained to perform clinical functions for basic and emergency obstetric and neonatal care, including administration of parenteral antibiotics, oxytocics and anticonvulsants; manual removal of placenta; removal of retained products of placenta; assisted vaginal delivery; and newborn resuscitation.Gupta N et al. Human resources for maternal, newborn and child health: from measurement and planning to performance for improved health outcomes. Human Resources for Health 2011, 9:16 Depending on the legal scope of practice, this may also include performing cesarean sections. A birth assistant, also known as a doula, \\"birth worker\\", \\"labor support person\\", \\"labour coach\\", or \\"childbirth educator\\", is someone other than the above who provides emotional support and general care and advice to women and families during pregnancy and childbirth.World Health Organization. 2010. Classifying health workers. http://www.who.int/hrh/statistics/Health_workers_classification.pdf A doula usually offers support services to the family in the weeks following the birth (\\"postpartum doula\\", see Postpartum confinement) and may also assist during labor and childbirth (\\"birth doula\\"). In many developing countries, a traditional birth attendant, also known as a traditional midwife, is a person who provide basic pregnancy and birthing care and advice based primarily on experience and knowledge acquired informally through the traditions and practices of the communities where they originated. They usually have no modern health care training and are not typically subject to professional regulation.

Scientific literacy is chiefly concerned with an understanding of the scientific method, units and methods of measurement, empiricism and understanding of statistics in particular correlations and qualitative versus quantitative observations and aggregate statistics, as well as a basic understanding of core scientific fields, such as physics, chemistry, biology, ecology, geology and computation.  Definition  The OECD PISA Framework (2015) defines scientific literacy as \\"the ability to engage with science-related issues, and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen.\\" A scientifically literate person, therefore, is willing to engage in reasoned discourse about science and technology which requires the competencies to: * Explain phenomena scientifically - recognize, offer and evaluate explanations for a range of natural and technological phenomena. * Evaluate and design scientific inquiry - describe and appraise scientific investigations and propose ways of addressing questions scientifically. * Interpret data and evidence scientifically - analyze and evaluate data, claims and arguments in a variety of representations and draw appropriate scientific conclusions. According to the United States National Center for Education Statistics, \\"scientific literacy is the knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes required for personal decision making, participation in civic and cultural affairs, and economic productivity\\". A scientifically literate person is defined as one who has the capacity to: * Understand, experiment, and reason as well as interpret scientific facts and their meaning. * Ask, find, or determine answers to questions derived from curiosity about everyday experiences. * Describe, explain, and predict natural phenomena. * Read articles with understanding of science in the popular press and engage in social conversation about the validity of the conclusions. * Identify scientific issues underlying national and local decisions and express positions that are scientifically and technologically informed. * Evaluate the quality of scientific information on the basis of its source and the methods used to generate it. * Pose and evaluate arguments based on evidence and to apply conclusions from such arguments appropriately. Scientific literacy may also be defined in language similar to the definitions of ocean literacy, Earth science literacy and climate literacy. Thus a scientifically literate person can: * Understand the science relevant to environmental and social issues. * Communicate clearly about the science. * Make informed decisions about these issues. Finally, scientific literacy may involve particular attitudes toward learning and using science. A scientifically-literate citizen is capable of researching matters of fact for him or herself.Noam Chomsky on what it means to be educated History Reforms in science education in the United States have often been driven by strategic challenges such as the launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 and the Japanese economic boom in the 1980s. By contrast, scientific literacy is now taken to mean that everyone should have a working knowledge of science and its role in society. Science literacy is seen as a right of every person and a requirement for responsible members of society, one that helps average people to make better decisions and enrich their lives. The shift occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the publication of Science for All Americans and Benchmarks for Science Literacy. Initial definitions of science literacy included elaborations of the actual content that people should understand, and this content often followed somewhat traditional lines (biology, chemistry, physics). Earth science was somewhat narrowly defined as expanded geological processes. In the decade after those initial documents, ocean scientists and educators revised the notion of science literacy to include more contemporary, systems-oriented views of the natural world, leading to scientific literacy programs for the ocean, climate, earth science, and so on. This shift has ensured that educators' views of science literacy stay in sync with the directions and advances of real science in the real world. Science, society, and the environment  The interdependence of humans and our natural environment is at the heart of scientific literacy in the Earth systems. As defined by nationwide consensus among scientists and educators, this literacy has two key parts. First, a literate person is defined, in language that echoes the above definition of scientific literacy. Second, a set of concepts are listed, organized into six to nine big ideas or essential principles. This defining process was undertaken first for ocean literacy, then for the Great Lakes, estuaries, the atmosphere, and climate. Earth science literacy is one of the types of literacy defined for Earth systems; the qualities of an Earth science literate person are representative of the qualities for all the Earth system literacy definitions. According to the Earth Science Literacy Initiative, an Earth-science-literate person: * understands the fundamental concepts of Earth‚Äôs many systems * knows how to find and assess scientifically credible information about Earth * communicates about Earth science in a meaningful way * is able to make informed and responsible decisions regarding Earth and its resources All types of literacy in Earth systems have a definition like the above. Ocean literacy is further defined as \\"understanding our impact on the ocean and the ocean's impact on us\\". Similarly, the climate literacy website includes a guiding principle for decision making; \\"humans can take action to reduce climate change and its impacts\\". Each type of Earth systems literacy then defines the concepts students should understand upon graduation from high school. Current educational efforts in Earth systems literacy tend to focus more on the scientific concepts than on the decision-making aspect of literacy, but environmental action remains as a stated goal. The theme of science in a socially-relevant context appears in many discussions of scientific literacy. Ideas that turn up in the life sciences include an allusion to ecological literacy, the \\"well-being of earth\\". Robin Wright, a writer for Cell Biology Education, laments \\"will [undergraduates'] misunderstandings or lack of knowledge about science imperil our democratic way of life and national security?\\" A discussion of physics literacy includes energy conservation, ozone depletion and global warming. The mission statement of the Chemistry Literacy Project includes environmental and social justice. Technological literacy is defined in a three-dimensional coordinate space; on the knowledge axis, it is noted that technology can be risky, and that it \\"reflects the values and culture of society\\". Energy Literacy boasts several websites, including one associated with climate literacy. Attitudes as part of scientific literacy Attitudes about science can have a significant effect on scientific literacy. In education theory, understanding of content lies in the cognitive domain, while attitudes lie in the affective domain. Thus, negative attitudes, such as fear of science, can act as an affective filter and an impediment to comprehension and future learning goals. Studies of college students' attitudes about learning physics suggest that these attitudes may be divided into categories of real world connections, personal connections, conceptual connections, student effort and problem-solving. The decision-making aspect of science literacy suggests further attitudes about the state of the world, one's responsibility for its well-being and one's sense of empowerment to make a difference. These attitudes may be important measures of science literacy, as described in the case of ocean literacy. Promoting and measuring Proponents of scientific literacy tend to focus on what is learned by the time a student graduates from high school. Science literacy has always been an important element of the standards movement in education. All science literacy documents have been drafted with the explicit intent of influencing educational standards, as a means to drive curriculum, teaching, assessment, and ultimately, learning nationwide. Programs to promote scientific literacy among students abound, including several programs sponsored by technology companies, as well as quiz bowls and science fairs. A partial list of such programs includes the Global Challenge Award, the National Ocean Sciences Bowl and Action Bioscience. Some organizations have attempted to compare the scientific literacy of adults in different countries. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that scientific literacy in the United States is not measurably different from the OECD average. Science News reports \\"The new U.S. rate, based on questionnaires administered in 2008, is seven percentage points behind Sweden, the only European nation to exceed the Americans. The U.S. figure is slightly higher than that for Denmark, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands. And it‚Äôs double the 2005 rate in the United Kingdom (and the collective rate for the European Union).\\" University educators are attempting to develop reliable instruments to measure scientific literacy, and the use of concept inventories is increasing in the fields of physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology and earth science.

Many lamp brands (such as the Anglepoise, originator of the concept, and Luxo L-1) as well as other devices, such as drawing boards, use this principle. Configuration 200px A balanced-arm lamp has a base, two connected arms fitted with springs, and a lamp-head. The lamp can be moved into any position, and the springs will maintain the position until moved again. The same mechanism can be employed in other devices with similar requirements, such as copy holders for typists and some computer display holders. This article uses the terminology lamp cap, forearm, upper arm and base for the four basic parts of these lamps. For the physics and theory behind balanced-arm lamps, see Classical mechanics, linkage and torque. There are different methods to balance the lamp-cap of a balanced- arm lamp. Some lamps have two coil springs working in parallel on both sides of the pivoting arm. (A set of springs functions in the same way as a single spring.) Others are balanced with counterweights (a method frequently used in drawing-boards). Friction between parts of the lamp arm can also be used to maintain balance. There are a number of mechanical solutions (coupling, hydraulics and pneumatic arms) which have occasionally been used for balanced- arm lamps. Lamps balanced with springs Compression and tension springs at rest and under load There are many variations of construction with springs. Springs can be located on the mechanical equivalent of the forearm or the upper arm, or both, as well as nearer the base. Some lamps use tension springs, and others use compression springs. The adjacent image shows (left to right) a compression spring at rest, then under load, followed by a tension spring at rest, and then under load. Springs have a limited lifting capacity and extension length. Some springs can resonate, producing low-level unwanted noise. =One tension spring= ; Spring-balanced upper arm, flexible forearm A flexible forearm This lamp has a stiff flexible tube as its forearm, and a spring-balanced arm to support it near the middle. That way there is a flexible lamp with a long reach. ; Tension spring over wheels A spring over two wheels The wheel to control the forearm is smaller than the wheel that controls the upper arm. The lamp cap rotates the same direction as the upper arm and forearm. ; Two arms, one spring, one toothed wheel A single spring controlling upper arm and forearm With this technique the tension spring has a double function: it controls both the forearm and the upper arm. This is not a common arm lamp system. The lamp cap rotates the same direction as the upper arm and forearm. =Two tension springs= ; Two parallelograms and two tension spring sets An upper arm showing three parallel bars One tension spring set controls the forearm, which is a parallelogram having two bars. A stronger spring set controls the upper arm, which has three parallel bars (see photo, left). (There is a less stable construction with two parallel bars in the upper arm which is less expensive to manufacture.) Due to the parallel linkage of the lamp, the lamp cap keeps pointing in the same vertical direction when adjusting the height of the lamp. As with most balanced-arm lamps, the whole assembly can rotate in the horizontal plane, and is mounted on a stable foot. ; One parallelogram and two extension spring sets Anglepoise-style lamp A lamp like the Anglepoise lamp has one parallelogram and two extension springs. One spring controls the shortest arm of a parallelogram. Parallel to this shortest arm there is the forearm. To keep these arms parallel there are two other parallel arms (upper arm) that are controlled by a second extension spring. The lamp cap rotates the same direction as the upper arm and forearm. ; Single forearm bar, one parallelogram, two tension spring sets Diagram of a single-forearm lamp The forearm of this lamp consist of a single bar. When it is adjusted, the angle of the lamp cap changes along with the arm. ; Tension springs within the arms Tension springs within the arms A lamp like the Tolomeo desk lamp has no parallelograms in either arm. In this modern lamp the tension springs are hidden in the arms. The lamp cap rotates the same direction as the upper arm and forearm. =Compression springs= ; Compression springs in the arms Compression springs in the arms The short arms (green) stay parallel. One spring puts pull force on the blue arm. (If the blue arm is tilted back the second spring on this arm gets push force.) The blue arm controls the two parallel arms (red) that make up the upper arm. The other spring puts pull force on the other blue arm. This arm controls the forearm (magenta). The two springs can be the same size; one spring has to lift more weight but is more vertical. The other spring lifts less weight but is more horizontal. ; Compression springs near the foot Spring-balanced bending arm lamp One compression spring controls a very short arm (grey). The Roller chain cable connects this arm parallel to the forearm (yellow). The longer spring controls the (blue) arm. The body (red) can turn in the horizontal plane. The body is connected to a stable foot. The body can be smaller because the pressure springs can protrude below the body. ; A compression spring with one parallelogram A compression spring with one parallelogram In this method, just one compression spring controls a pantographic arm. Lamps balanced by pressure and friction ; Pressure and friction lamps This construction is quite common in Italian lamps. Gravity causes the parallelogram to deform, making the gap between the long arms smaller. This increases pressure on the rubber in the gap, and the resulting friction holds the arm in balance. Lamps balanced with one counterweight Advantages of one swinging counterbalance is that the lamp can have a longer arm length. Disadvantages are that the stand is less stable, the lamp needs a heavy foot to stand stable. ; A single counterweight Single weight chain lamp This construction uses a chain to keep the arm with the counterweight and the forearm parallel. The lamp-cap and counterweight move in opposite directions (both away from the base or both towards it). The balance that is required is shown by the following formula: :d1 = Lamp-cap to base; m1 = weight of lamp-cap :d2 = counterweight to base; m2 = weight of counterweight :m1 √ó d1 = m2 √ó d2 ; One parallelogram with one counterweight One parallelogram and one counterweight This lamp has a heavy base, with a parallelogram pantograph construction formed by bars which are all hinged on each other. One long bar extends past the parallelogram construction and has a counterweight. One short bar also extends past the parallelogram construction and holds the lamp cap. The base has an arc formed stand so the counterweight does not hit the stand in vertical position. ; One parallelogram with an extended counterweight 200px This lamp is similar to the one above, but as the counterweight has a low position the lamp needs no heavy foot for stability as the center of gravity is low. The counterbalance does not swing, but slides and rotates safely around the center of the stand. ; Three parallelograms with one counterweight 500px This lamp stand has a complex construction with matching narrow openings. This lamp is out of production . Lamps balanced with two counterweights ; A single arm with two counterweights 300px With this lamp the movement is very limited (the arm moves up and down only) but the technique is nice to look at. As the forearm becomes more horizontal the weight ceases to be balanced on both side of the base. The weight of the base is needed to avoid over-balancing. ; Two arms with two counterweights A lamp type like the Tizio works like this. A balancing arm (the forearm) has on one side of an axis a small counterweight and on the other side a lamp cap. These parts are lifted by a second bigger balancing arm (the upper arm) that has on the other side of a second axis a heavier counterweight. The lamp designed by Edouard-Wilfrid Buquet in 1927 works in this way. The lamp is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. The two axes have a different angle, and this has some advantages. Lamp-cap x fore-Arm = Arm x Small weight (Lamp- cap + Small weight) x upper-arm = Arm x Big weight. 300px Lamps using other systems Here are some less common ways of balancing arms. ; Lamps having a vertical axis Lamps having a vertical axis This kind of lamp has a forearm balanced by weight or springs. Its disadvantage is that the upper arm cannot point up or forwards. ; Friction Lamp with flexible bars The friction between the twisted arm controls the movement between the arms. Another lamp with flexible bars This arm system also works with friction. ; Mechanical coupling devices Mechanical locking jointlamp This lamp works by coupling together the upper arm and the forearm. It is called a gravity-locked or cam-locked elbow.See here ; Hydraulic arm Moving streetlamps in Rotterdam The pivoting arm streetlamps in the Schouwburgplein, Rotterdam use a pair of hydraulic cylinders to control the forearm and upper arm. ; Pneumatic arm 300px Arm lamp with a pneumatic cylinder. The gravity compress the air in the pneumatic cylinder. In popular culture * Two spring-balanced desk lamps of this type feature as the main characters in the Pixar animated film Luxo Jr.. It also serves as the letter I in the Pixar logo presented before each of their films. * Myster Shadow-Sky is the only composer who from 1980 to 2007 performed the balanced-arm lamp as a musical instrument: the archisonic lamp. In 1980 he wrote the score \\"Ludus Musicae Temporarium\\" for a balanced arm lamp orchestra. The world premiere was performed by Les Percussions de Strasbourg at the Manca contemporary music festival in Nice in 1988.

Crane Carrier Company (often abbreviated CCC) is a manufacturer that specializes in construction truck and garbage truck chassis. Located in New Philadelphia, Ohio, it was established by Robert Zeligson in 1946, along with the affiliated Zeligson Trucks. The primary design of CCC's trucks are Cab- Beside-Engine (CBE) or half-cabs, most notably the Century II Unimixer. Half- cabs have the advantage of being able to carry the booms of cranes, hence the name of the company.http://www.cranecarrier.com/ History A 1999 CCC Century II concrete mixer CCC began as a firm that remanufactured World War II-era surplus vehicles for civilian crane-carrying use. In 1953 CCC presented their first own truck, and soon evolved into a company that manufactured over- the-road trucks for concrete mixing, logging, mining, and other construction industries, including a wheeled loader. CCC also builds trucks for oil drilling, water well drilling, terminal tractors, and aviation fuelers. As with most American specialty truck manufacturers, the customer's choice of proprietary engines and transmissions have been available. CCC wheel loader built for the U.S. Army Though primarily building CBEs, CCC started moving toward the two-seater market during the 1970s, with models such as the Centaur. The Centurion is a series of low-entry trucks, primarily used for garbage collection. The Centurion has an engine mounted behind the cab and was also available with dual controls. CCC manufactured Type D school bus chassis during the early to mid-1990s, which were used by bus manufacturers Carpenter Body Company and Wayne Corporation. CCC sold Zeligson in 1980. It lasted as a separate company for nine years. In 2008, CCC and its parent, CCI Corp., were sold to Glenview, Illinois-based Illinois Tool Works, which stated its plans to continue operating CCC as a separate company.Illinois company acquires Crane Carrier, Tulsa World, September 16, 2008. Crane Carrier Company (CCC) was acquired by Hines Corporation in June of 2013 and the company‚Äôs headquarters was relocated to New Philadelphia, Ohio. Under Hines, a strategic merger was initiated to join CCC and Kimble Manufacturing forming Hines Specialty Vehicle Group ‚Äì manufacturer of custom heavy-duty chassis and purpose built vehicles for the refuse and recycling, infrastructure maintenance, ground support, agriculture, oil and gas, and concrete mixer markets. Crane Carrier Company (CCC) embarked on a new chapter by launching as an independent company in 2019.

Davis is widely and erroneously considered to be the first Black lawyer in Canada, but Robert Sutherland (who was called to the bar in 1855 and died in 1878) was already dead before Davis was called to the bar of the Law Society of Upper Canada, and Abraham Walker was called to the New Brunswick bar in 1882. Davis was born in Maryland in 1846 and grew up in the Colchester Township, Ontario area. He was the son of James Davis, a former slave from Virginia who came to Colchester Township, Canada West via the Underground Railroad in 1850. Delos started by teaching in school and then began to study law with Gordon Watts Leggatt and Charles Robert Horne of Windsor due to his dream of being a lawyer. In 1868, Davis married Nancy Jane Mitchell. He qualified to practice as a notary public in 1873. Since he was not able to find a law office that was willing to let him article with them, in 1884, William Douglas Balfour introduced a special act allowing Davis to practice as a solicitor if he passed the required Law Society of Upper Canada test. A second special act allowed Davis to become a barrister and he was called to the bar on November 15th, 1886. On November 10, 1910, the Ontario Government appointed him a King's Counsel, \\"the first Black so appointed in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the British Dominions\\".First Black Lawyer in Canada He set up practice in Amherstburg in 1887. From 1900 to 1905, he practiced with his son Frederick Homer Alphonso, who had graduated from Osgoode Hall. In 1907, he married Mary Jane Banks; his first wife had died in 1893 during childbirth. Davis was named King's Council in 1910, the year after he retired from practice. He died at home near Amherstburg in 1915.

It connects Camano Island and Stanwood to a junction with Interstate 5 (I-5) northwest of Arlington. The eastern section of the road was constructed in 1887 and was connected to Camano Island by a cable ferry, which was replaced by a bridge opened in 1909. The highway was paved in 1916 and acquired by the state government in 1945, becoming Secondary State Highway 1Y (SSH 1Y). The state funded new bridges across the Stillaguamish River and Davis Slough and later renumbered the highway as SR 532 in 1964, a few years before the highway was moved to a new roadway. From to 2009 to 2010, major sections of the highway were rebuilt, including a new bridge over the Stillaguamish River. Route description Looking westbound on SR 532 in downtown Stanwood, towards the Camano Gateway Bridge SR 532 begins at the intersection of Camano Drive and Sunrise Boulevard at the Y-shaped Terry's Corner on Camano Island. The highway passes the island's branch library and park-and-ride, traveling east across farmland on the north side of Livingston Bay. It then descends from the hilltop and crosses Davis Slough, a small stream that marks the boundary between Island and Snohomish counties. SR 532 continues across the wetland and crosses the main arm of the Stillaguamish River on the Camano Gateway Bridge at the west end of Stanwood. The highway runs through Stanwood on the south side of the city, following the bank of the Stillaguamish River. Near the city's eastern downtown and Amtrak station, SR 532 crosses over a railroad and intersects the Pioneer Highway, which was formerly signed as SR 530. From downtown Stanwood, the road passes through the city's suburban hilltop neighborhoods, including a business district centered at 72nd Avenue Northwest. SR 532 curves southeasterly after leaving the city, but returns to a northeasterly path near Sunday Lake. The highway ends at an interchange with I-5 near another park- and-ride lot, while the road continues east to SR 9 at Bryant. SR 532 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state's highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. In 2016, WSDOT calculated that 21,000 vehicles traveled on SR 532 in downtown Stanwood and 12,000 used it near the I-5 interchange, the highest and lowest traffic counts along the highway, respectively. History SR 532 crossed the Stillaguamish River on the Mark Clark Bridge, which served as the only road connection to Camano Island until 2010 Stanwood and Camano Island were originally connected by a horse-pulled cable ferry on the Stillaguamish River, which was replaced by a steel swing bridge that opened on August 7, 1909. A lift bridge across the Davis Slough was completed in 1912. The eastern approach through Stanwood and neighboring East Stanwood was paved with bricks in 1913, replacing a wagon road built in 1887 to Bryant. The rest of the road was paved by the Snohomish County government in 1916, completing a Stanwood‚ÄìArlington highway. The state government took over maintenance of the Stanwood‚ÄìCamano highway in 1945, designating it as Secondary State Highway 1Y (SSH 1Y). SSH 1Y ran from Camano Island to East Stanwood, where it was briefly concurrent with SSH 1E, and continued to a junction with Primary State Highway 1 (PSH 1, also signed as U.S. Route 99). At the request of the three communities, the state government allocated $615,000 in funds (equivalent to $ in dollars) to construct a new bridge over both the Stillaguamish River and Davis Slough. The new concrete bridge over the Stillaguamish River was opened on July 23, 1950, and named for World War II general Mark Wayne Clark, who resided seasonally on Camano Island. Further lobbying from Stanwood resulted in a $395,500 budget allotment (equivalent to $ in dollars) to relocate most of SSH 1Y onto a more southerly highway that would bypass East Stanwood and include modern shoulders and gentler grades. The first phase, centered around a railroad overpass south of East Stanwood, was completed as scheduled in November 1962, despite part of the overpass collapsing midway through construction. The remaining highway between East Stanwood and US 99 (later rebuilt as I-5) was completed in October 1969, serving a temporary partial cloverleaf interchange until I-5 was expanded in 1972. During the 1964 highway renumbering, SSH 1Y was replaced by SR 532 and SSH 1E became SR 530. In the 1990s, population growth in Stanwood led to a 70 percent increase in traffic along some sections of SR 532. WSDOT conducted several corridor and traffic studies for the highway in the early 2000s, recommending that SR 532 be expanded to five lanes by 2022 to handle expected traffic growth. The Nickel gas tax program approved by the state legislature in 2005 included $84 million to fund a series of expansion and replacement projects along SR 532. The corridor improvement program included a replacement for the Mark Clark Bridge, pavement repairs on the railroad overpass, and the addition of several truck climbing lanes, left-turn lanes, and sidewalks in downtown Stanwood. Construction began in 2009 and a majority of the projects were completed by the following year. The Camano Gateway Bridge was opened to traffic on August 13, 2010, replacing the Mark Clark Bridge. The new bridge has shoulders for bicyclists and pedestrians and meets modern earthquake standards. A replacement for the Davis Slough Bridge began construction in August 2014 and was completed in May 2016, costing $29.3 million and funded with state gas taxes. The new bridge includes widened shoulders and was raised higher to reduce disruptions during floods and high tide.

Antonio was raised in Port Melbourne, Victoria, a working class suburb of Melbourne. Her father was a Chilean docker of French and Spanish descent who died when she was 15 months. With the encouragement of her uncle she learnt her cricket from the boys in her neighbourhood streets. As a young girl during the Great Depression, she was lucky enough to find work at a shoe factory in the industrial suburb of Collingwood. The factory was home to a women's cricket team where Antonio came to the attention of Eddie Conlon, a club cricketer with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the game. With the assistance of Conlon, Antonio developed a rare mix of leg spin and off spin, including a top spinner and a wrong'un. She came to the attention of the Australian Women's Cricket Council and was invited to play for Victoria against the travelling English team. Taking 10/48, including the star batswoman, Molly Hide, she was selected to represent Australia in the inaugural women's Test match at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground at the age of 17. The first Australian to take a wicket in women's Test cricket, Antonio took twelve wickets in the three Test series and was considered suitable for a publicity date with the great Don Bradman. Invited to tour England in 1937, the ¬£75 passage was beyond the means of a shoe factory worker and her family. A campaign started and thanks mainly to the generosity of James McLeod, a businessman and sometime acquaintance of her late father, the necessary funds were raised to allow her to take her place in the squad. Antonio proved successful again on the tour taking 9/101 in Northampton and 8/65 at Blackpool. The final Test of the series at The Oval would be Antonio's last. Tiring of the grind and no longer finding the game enjoyable, she retired from cricket at the age of 20. In 1943 she married Eddie Howard, an Englishman resident in Australia, and settled down into domestic life, raising a large family. She died in Melbourne in 2002.

Plot In 1985, town planning student Richard Gillespie visits his older sister Natalie, whom he is not very close to since they grew up separately. Natalie has recently split with her boyfriend and is unhappy with her job. She's extremely depressed, and Richard's attempts to lighten the mood are ended when Natalie pulls him into an unexpectedly passionate embrace, kissing him on the lips. She immediately apologizes, making the excuse that she just wanted someone to hug. Richard seems stunned, but not disturbed. Six years pass, during which Richard achieves success while Natalie's career stagnates; she marries a powerful and rich stock analyst named Sinclair Bryant. When Richard visits Natalie, he is introduced to Sinclair and the two get along well. Shortly after Richard's visit to her home, Natalie goes to Richard's apartment. They attempt to resist their attraction to one another, but eventually they succumb to their desires and have sex. They meet a few more times and eventually Sinclair begins to have suspect that Natalie is having an affair. He questions Richard, believing Richard knows who Natalie's lover is. Some time later, after learning that Sinclair and Natalie plan to move to America, Richard has an emotional breakdown. He attempts to commit suicide with sleeping pills, but Natalie arrives unexpectedly at his apartment. She invites him to the going-away party, on the condition that he not attempt to renew their affair. He attends with his colleague Jessica, but abandons her to search for Natalie. On finding her, the two have a fight, then return to the gathering disheveled. Sinclair appears, and staying calm, makes it clear that he knows what has happened. Cast * Alan Rickman as Sinclair * Clive Owen as Richard * Saskia Reeves as Natalie * Karl Johnson as Colin * Lesley Sharp as Jessica * Kate Garside as Paula * Niall Buggy as Geof Themes The film is largely a grand-scale re-working of Poliakoff's earlier stage play Hitting Town in that the main plot remains one of brother/sister incest, and the film re-uses some lines from that play in dialogue between the brother and sister characters. Beyond this, the film also covers the chaos (as the film sees it) that was the initial stages of the London Docklands development, the late 1980s recession and attitudes towards AIDS. A parallel thread running through the movie is the rapacious replacement of the classical by the modern, represented visually by old and new buildings.Plays: 3, Stephen Poliakoff, Methuen Drama, 1998, Introduction, pages xi-xii. Locations The film was shot mainly in London and, specifically, London Docklands with Sinclair and Natalie's house being in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.

Both was born in Bloomfield, New Jersey, the son of a carpenter. Inspired by The Beatles, he learned to play the guitar at age 11 and started his first band in the 8th grade. He also started writing songs and making simple recordings on a home tape recorder by age 14. Throughout high school Both continued writing songs and playing in bands. When he graduated from high school he attended The Ridgewood School of Art and studied to become a commercial artist. In his second year of school his strong interest in music led him to quit art school and search for a job in the music business. At age 19, armed with nothing little more than a letter of recommendation from one of his art teachers, he landed a job as A&R; assistant to Peter K. Seigel at Polydor Records, NYC. There Both learned the basics of record production from Seigel and the fundamentals of record mastering from Bob Ludwig who was a mastering engineer at Sterling Sound. He also began to develop his engineering skills producing mixes for James Brown. In 1972, he became James Brown's recording engineer, A&R; director and production supervisor. He worked on 11 of Brown's albums including the number one hits \\"Get on the Good Foot\\", \\"The Payback\\", \\"My Thang\\" and \\"Doing It to Death\\" with Fred Wesley & the J.B.s (Brown's backup band). Both also recorded records for artists signed to Brown's production company including Hank Ballard, Maceo Parker, Lyn Collins, Bobby Byrd, Vicki Anderson and others. Both left Brown in 1977 and opened his own studio, Twain Recording, in New Jersey. He has done recordings for thousands of bands in the New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania areas such as Stephanie White & The Philth Harmonic, The Antics], The Insomniacs, Bonjee, The Disconnects, Crazy & The Brains, Mythology, Dan Sheehan Conspiracy and many others.. Both has also had years of experience recording punk rock/hardcore bands. New Jersey punk/hardcore producer Mark \\"The Mutha\\" Chesley recorded the bulk of Mutha Records catalog at Twain Recording including The Worst, Chronic Sick, Secret Syde, Tribulation, Youth in Asia, Stisism, Lost in Aggression, Fatal Rage and many more. Producer Marty Munsch of Punk Rock Records has also recorded many notable projects with Bob, including U.S. Chaos, The Vote (band), The New York Rel-X, Broken Heroes, The Flare Ups, The Stun Gunz, Terabithia, to name just a few. Both worked closely with Harry Weinger of Polygram Records catalog development on the re-issue of many of James Browns classic seventies albums on CD throughout the 1990s. In 1993 Both began teaching audio production courses at Ramapo College of NJ. In 1995 he also started teaching audio courses at William Paterson University, NJ. Both recorded the drumming technique DVD Soul of the Funky Drummers with Clyde Stubblefield and Jabo Starks in 1999 and recorded the Accelerate Your Playing DVD series for The Berklee Press in 2000. 2007 saw Bob once again reuniting with Fred Wesley to record \\"Funk For Your Ass\\" for Columbia Music. Both's work is cited in several books including The Billboard Book of Number One Rhythm & Blues Hits and Hit Me, Fred, Fred Wesley's biography. Both has written articles on recording techniques for magazines including EQ, REP, Soundtrack, Pro Music and others. He has received RIAA gold record awards for several of his James Brown recordings and is listed in The Marquis Who's Who in Entertainment. Currently Both continues to operate Twain Recording, engineering and producing records in rock, R&B;, alternative and a variety of other musical styles. He performs several times a month playing guitar in a classic rock band just for the fun of making music.

Moore was a socialist lawyer and the defense attorney of the controversial Sacco and Vanzetti case. He had collaborated in many labor and Industrial Workers of the World trials. He played a minor role in several celebrated I.W.W. trials, including the Los Angeles Times bombing case in 1911 and the Ettor‚ÄìGiovannitti case, which arose from the 1912 Lawrence, Massachusetts, textile strike. Following the acquittal of Ettor and Giovannitti, Moore spent the next several years roaming the country defending I.W.W. organizers. He was involved in the Centralia Massacre trial and the mass prosecution, on charges of sedition, of the I.W.W. in Chicago in 1918. Errors in a later trial, however, led Big Bill Haywood to demand Moore's resignation as I.W.W. attorney in 1920. Moore's career was revived by his being hired to head the defense team for Sacco and Vanzetti in the summer of 1920. Sacco and Vanzetti case Many Italians involved with the defense of Sacco and Vanzetti were suspicious of Moore from the start, but they desperately needed a lawyer, any lawyer. \\"We didn't know what to do,\\" said Aldino Felicani, head of the Sacco-Vanzetti Defense Committee. \\"We were just in despair.\\"Watson, Bruce, Sacco & Vanzetti: The Men, the Murders, and the Judgment of Mankind, Viking, 2007, 88. Arriving in Boston and meeting with the two defendants, Moore immediately saw the case as more than a murder trial. The uncompromising anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti, Moore realized, had the potential to spark an international cause c√©l√®bre. While preparing his courtroom case, Moore began alerting labor and socialist organizations in America and Europe, thus setting the stage for the worldwide attention the two men would later draw. But Moore's style annoyed more than the Defense Committee. Unkempt and utterly indifferent to decorum, he inspired little confidence in his clients. Sacco came to loathe Moore, and Vanzetti later regretted hiring him. In a letter written to Moore from prison, Sacco signed \\"Your implacable enemy, now and forever, Nick Sacco.\\" Groff, B. (2019) Analysis: Selected prison letters of Nicola Sacco. Salem Press Encyclopedia. Their fears were borne out in court, where Moore proved both incompetent and inflammatory. In the steamy courtroom, he frequently took off his jacket, and once, his shoes, enraging Judge Webster Thayer. Thayer routinely denied Moore's motions and lectured the California-based lawyer on how law was conducted in Massachusetts. Thayer once told reporters that \\"no long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!\\"RADICALS: Thayer Flayed (Time Magazine - May 16, 1927) Fred Moore was considered by some much more than a criminal defense attorney. Eugene Lyons, a strong socialist who later went on to be a senior editor of Reader's Digest described Moore as an idealist with \\"no conscience once he decided his client was innocent. He would stop at nothing, frame evidence, suborn witnesses, have his people work on witnesses who had seen the wrong things...\\" Lyons worked with Moore on publicity to stimulate the sympathies of those who were unaware of the two Italian anarchists' trials.Felix, David Protest Sacco-Vanzetti and the Intellectuals. Indiana University Press, 1965, 22-23. Moore's summation before the jury likewise failed to mention other factors that might have acquitted the men, including a cap found at the scene that did not fit Sacco and anomalies concerning Vanzetti's gun. After Sacco and Vanzetti were convicted, however, Moore's passion for politics and notoriety consumed him. For the next three years, he dug up evidence in his clients' defense while simultaneously publicizing the case through worldwide labor channels. While the names Sacco and Vanzetti were chanted in marches across Europe and later South America, Moore filed appeal after appeal, keeping the men from a quick trip to the electric chair. He also interviewed several prosecution witnesses, raising doubts that still dog the case. However, Moore continued to anger both the defendants and their defense committee, and was dismissed from the case in 1924. He returned to Los Angeles to live with his ailing mother. He never tried another case. He did however, weigh in on the Sacco-Vanzetti case. In 1928, after the men had been executed, author Upton Sinclair interviewed Moore in connection with a book Sinclair was writing about the case. Sinclair was stunned to hear that Moore had come to conclude that both Sacco and Vanzetti were guilty. Many have since cited this as proof of their guilt, but others were skeptical. \\"Fred is embittered because he was dropped from the case and it has poisoned his mind,\\" said one of Moore's many ex-wives.Watson, 363. Boston corporate attorney William Thompson, who waged a spirited defense of the men following Moore's dismissal, never doubted the innocence of Sacco and Vanzetti. \\"To have known you 6 years ago,\\" Vanzetti wrote to Thompson in 1926, \\"I would never have been a convict.\\"Watson, 263.

Arrival in Mexico Around 1580 Don Luis de Carabajal, Spanish governor of Nuevo Le√≥n, brought with him to Mexico his brother-in-law, Don Francisco Rodr√≠guez de Matos, and his sister, Do√±a Francisca Nu√±ez de Carabajal, with eight of their nine children, Do√±a Isabel, the oldest, 25 years of age, widow of Gabriel de Herrera; Do√±a Catalina, Do√±a Mariana, Do√±a Leonor, Don Baltasar, Don Luis, Miguel and Anica (the last two being very young). Another son, Gaspar, a pious young man, perhaps a monk, in the convent of Santo Domingo, Mexico, had arrived a short time before. Do√±a Catalina and Do√±a Leonor married respectively Antonio Diaz de Caceres (see Caceres family) and Jorge de Almeida‚Äîtwo Spanish merchants residing in Mexico City and interested in the Taxco mines. The entire family then removed to the capital, where, in the year 1590, while in the midst of prosperity, and seemingly leading Christian lives, they were seized by the Inquisition. Auto-da-f√© Torture of Francisca de Carabajal at Mexico, from El Libro Rojo, 1870 The eldest, Do√±a Isabel, was tortured until she implicated the whole of the Carabajal family. The whole family was forced to confess and abjure at a public auto-de-f√©, celebrated on Saturday, February 24, 1590. Luis de Carabajal the younger, with his mother and four sisters, was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, and his brother, Baltasar, who had fled upon the first warning of danger, was, along with his deceased father Francisco Rodriguez de Matos, burnt in effigy. In January, 1595, Do√±a Francisca and her children were accused of a relapse into Judaism and convicted. During their imprisonment they were tempted to communicate with one another on Spanish pear seeds, on which they wrote touching messages of encouragement to remain true to their faith. They were found out and at the resulting auto-da-f√©, Do√±a Francisca and her children, Isabel, Catalina, Leonor, and Luis, died at the stake, together with Manuel Diaz, Beatriz Enriquez, Diego Enriquez, and Manuel de Lucena. Of her other children, Do√±a Mariana, who lost her reason for a time, was tried and put to death at an auto-da-f√© held in Mexico City on March 25, 1601; Anica, the youngest child, being \\"reconciled\\" at the same time.

A club house was built and players were recruited from around the area, most of them coming from the local schools of St Olaf's, Gaelscoil Thaobh na Coille, St Benildus College, and St Tiernan's. In recent years more and more players are coming from the Leopardstown and Stepaside areas.  Location  The club is located on the Sandyford Industrial Estate in Dublin and recruits players from all around the Sandyford and Balally area, including Wedgewood and The Gallops all the way up to Stepaside. In 1999 Dundrum-Churchtown joined forces with Naomh Olaf to serves both Dundrum and Churchtown areas. The club now has 9 schools in their area stretching from Churchtown right up to Stepaside.  Recent achievements  Football: The Club won promotion back to Division 2 in 2016, winning the promotion playoff after just missing out on automatic promotion. The club won the Dublin Intermediate Championship in 2013 and went on to represent Dublin before losing in a thrilling Leinster Intermediate Club Football Championship Semi-Final replay. The Junior team won Division 9 in 2016 and now football teams compete in AFL2, AFL5 and AFL9. Hurling: The club's two adult hurling teams playing in AHL3 and AHL6 and the 1st team competed in the Intermediate hurling championship. Ladies Football: After a long absence the club fielded an adult ladies team again in 2012 after the successful launch of the G4M initiative. A core of the G4M's transferred to a full adult team competing in the lower end of the leagues but have quickly progressed and took a championship in 2012, a cup and league double in 2013, and cup honours in 2014 and 2015. The team will compete in Div 4 in 2020. Camogie: In 2015, the club fielded an adult Camogie team for the first time ever, and finished the season with a Championship to show for their efforts. The club also has over 100 juvenile camogie players so the future looks bright.

History  GEC Computers started as Elliott Automation with the then ageing Elliott 900 series, and needed to develop a new range of systems. Three ranges were identified, known internally as Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Alpha appeared first and became the GEC 2050 8-bit minicomputer. Beta followed and became the GEC 4080. Gamma was never developed, so a few of its enhanced features were consequently pulled back into the GEC 4080. The principal designer of the GEC 4080 was Dr. Michael Melliar-Smith and the principal designer of the GEC 4060 and GEC 4090 was Peter Mackley. The 4000 series systems were developed and manufactured in the UK at GEC Computers Borehamwood offices in Elstree Way. Development and manufacture transferred to GEC Computers new Dunstable factories in Woodside Estate, Dunstable in the late 1970s. In 1979, GEC Computers was awarded the Queen's Award for Technical Achievement for the development of the 4000 series, particularly Nucleus. By 1991, the number of systems manufactured was falling off, and manufacture was transferred to GPT's Beeston, Nottinghamshire factory, and development returned to Borehamwood. The last systems were manufactured around 1995, although there are still a few GEC 4220 systems operating in 2018 with maintenance provided by Telent and some GEC 4310 were operating until 2013.  Nucleus  The GEC 4000 series hardware and firmware included a pioneering facility known as Nucleus. Nucleus implements a number of features which are more usually implemented within an operating system kernel, and consequently operating systems running on GEC 4000 series systems do not need to directly provide these features themselves. Nucleus firmware cannot be reprogrammed by any code running on the system, and this made the systems particularly attractive to a number of security applications. Nucleus performs:P. J. Denning, \\"ACM president's letter: computer architecture: some old ideas that haven't quite made it yet\\", Communications of the ACM, 24 (9), 1981, page 553. * process scheduling * context switching * efficient semaphores * asynchronous message passing * memory segmentation and protection * error handling * I/O directly by processes, and routing of interrupts back to processes There is no provision for running any Supervisor/Privileged/kernel mode code on the 4000 systems‚Äîall operating system code runs as processes. Hence, device drivers, file system code, and other features which are often found within operating system kernels must be run in processes on the 4000 systems. Inherent in this is that they are all running in their own address spaces, protected from the actions of each other, just as all processes are. Nucleus is configured by a set of system tables, and processes which have a need to modify the operation of nucleus are given access to the relevant system tables. This would be the case for processes which directly change the state of other processes, processes which allocate and delete memory segments, processes which can change the routing of messages between other processes or change the mapping of I/O devices to processes, etc. Normally system table access is limited to relatively few trusted processes, and other processes which need to perform operations such as loading processes, allocating memory, etc. will pass a message to the relevant trusted process which it will vet before performing the action and replying.  Instruction set  The 4000 series has a CISC instruction set. It has 8-bit bytes, big-endian, byte-addressable memory, two's complement arithmetic, base-16 excess-64 floating point format (same as IBM System/360). The model numbers less than 4090 are 16-bit processors, and model numbers from 4090 upwards are mixed 16-bit and 32-bit processors. This relates to pointer sizes available to programs. All systems support 16-bit pointers, which is known as CST (Current Segment Table) addressing. The 32-bit systems also support 32-bit pointers, known as PAS (Paged Address Space) addressing. Each process has a PAST (Program Accessible Segment Table) which lists which of the system's memory segments the program is permitted to access. CST addressing allows 4 of the PAST entries to be mapped at addresses 0KiB, 16KiB, 32KiB, and 48KiB, giving the 16-bit/64KiB address space. Programs which use more than 64KiB of memory must explicitly map the PAST entries they require at any moment into their 4 CST entries, although Nucleus will automatically map different code segments into the CSTs. PAS addressing allows programs to view their address space as a flat 32-bit address space, with successive PAST entries appearing every 16KiB, and Nucleus performing the PAST entry segment mapping automatically. The 32-bit systems support both CST and PAS addressing mixed in the same process. All instructions are 16 bits wide, except for some PAS addressing instructions which are 32-bits wide. Instructions can only be run from CST address space. The 32-bit A register is the main accumulator register. There is a 32-bit B register too, which is most commonly used together with the A register as a 64-bit BA register for double precision floating point operations. A 16-bit X register is used mainly for array indexing, and two 16-bit Y and Z registers are used as 16-bit pointers. A 16-bit L register points to function local data, and a G register always contains zero which can be used as a 16-bit global pointer, and also an 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit zero value. The 16-bit S (sequence) register points to the next instruction to be obeyed. The 8 bit EC register contains condition codes bits. (Some of this is illustrated in the much simpler instruction set of the GEC 2050.) A read-only keys register allows programs to read the value set on the front panel toggle switches (keys) by the operations staff. No 32-bit PAS pointer register exists‚Äî32-bit PAS pointers always reside in memory in the 16-bit CST address space, and are accessed by using a 16-bit pointer. There is no instruction set support for a stack. There are a number of registers inaccessible to programs which are used by Nucleus, such as the hardware segment registers which point to the running process's 4 CSTs and master segment and PAS segments, and the system tables. The instruction set contains instructions which operate register-register, store-register, register-store, and store-store. There are a set of string manipulation instructions which operate on variable lengths of store, copying, comparing, or scanning for a pattern. There are a number of Nucleus instructions which do things such as send message to another process or a peripheral device, receive a message or interrupt, change a CST entry to point to a different segment which is accessible to the process, etc. The 4080 has a two-stage instruction pipeline. This becomes a four-stage pipeline for the 4220, the highest-performing system in the series. The entry-level 415x and 4x6x systems have only a single-stage pipeline. The normal operating mode of the CPU is called Full Nucleus. All systems also support a limited mode of operation called Basic Test. In Basic Test mode, Nucleus is disabled, I/O is performed differently, and only a single program can run, restricted to the bottom 64KiB of store, but all other non-nucleus and non-PAS instructions operate normally. This mode is used very early during booting to set up the system tables required by Nucleus, before obeying a Switch Full Nucleus instruction. Once the system has switched to Full Nucleus, it cannot return to Basic Test mode without operator intervention at the front panel, in effect killing any operating system which was running. Basic Test mode is also used to run certain test software (hence the name).  Input/output  The 4000 I/O design is based around having a number of Input/Output Processors known as IOPs, each of which interfaces between the store and a set of I/O controllers. The IOPs are controlled by the Nucleus function in the CPU, but once an I/O event is triggered, they operate autonomously without interaction with the CPU until the I/O completes. The Normal Interface IOPs can each support up to 255 or 256 simultaneous I/O operations, each on a separate Way. The I/O controllers on each IOP would each occupy one or more Ways, depending on how many simultaneous I/O operations they need to handle. The IOP polices each Way's access to main store, allowing only access to successive memory locations defined for the I/O operation that Way is currently performing. The earlier IOPs performed 8-bit and 16-bit wide store accesses, with a burst mode for doing up to 8 transfers together for higher throughput I/O controllers. The later IOPs added 32-bit wide store accesses. All systems have at least 1 IOP. On the 4080, this first IOP was called the Basic Multiplexer Channel, or BMC, and the 4080 front panel provides for controlling both the CPU and the BMC. The entry level 415x and 4x6x systems have their first IOP (Integral Multiplexer Channel, or IMC) integrated into the Nucleus firmware, and thus I/O operations on the IMC did have some impact on CPU performance, although the 4x6x systems could have additional external IOPs added too. The 4000 series Nucleus i/o instructions and system tables allow for up to 8 IOPs, although most of the models in the 4000 series range had some type of hardware limitation which reduced this. The 408x systems had 4-ported store, with the CPU and first IOP sharing one of these, and up to 3 additional IOPs connected to the remaining store ports. (Early documentation shows these additional store ports were also designed to connect additional CPUs, although this was not a configuration which was ever sold using 4080 processors.) Later models had more varied number of store ports, depending on how many store port boards could be fitted into the system. The 4190 could support the full complement of 8 IOPs, and the 4190D supported 8 IOPs with 2 CPUs. Some commonly used I/O Controllers are the interval timer, system console controller, punched tape reader and punch controllers, line printer controller (all these use just a single Way), a number of SMD (and earlier disk bus interface) disk controllers for controlling up to four drives (all using 2 Ways), Pertec PPC magnetic tape controllers for up to four ¬Ω\\" tape drives, and a number of multi ported synchronous and asynchronous serial communication controllers (using between 4 and 32 Ways). A digital I/O board (using 4 Ways) was commonly used for direct process control interfacing, and for providing a fast parallel link between systems. A CAMAC crate controller was also available (again, used for process control interfacing). The Normal Interface bus which these controllers plug into is a published interface, and many customers also built their own controllers for their own specific process control requirements. Also, the earlier GEC 2050 minicomputer used an 8-bit version of the Normal Interface, and most I/O Controllers could be used on both ranges of systems. All the IOPs designed and built through the 1970s provided the same Normal Interface bus for I/O Controllers, and the I/O controllers could generally be used in any of them. In the 1980s, some more specialised IOPs were designed. A Direct Memory Access Director (DMAD) IOP allowed for a new type of I/O controller which had more freedom to access main memory, and allowed the design of more intelligent communications controllers. A SCSI IOP generated a SCSI bus for attaching more modern disks, and also included an integrated Interval Timer, system console controller, and Calendar Clock so that an additional Normal Interface IOP and separate controllers was not required to support just these functions.  Customers  Users of GEC 4000 series systems included many British university physics and engineering departments, the central computing service of University College London (Euclid) and Keele University, the JANET academic/research network X.25 switching backbone, Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory, Daresbury Laboratory, Harwell Laboratory, NERC, Met Office, CERN, ICI, British Telecom, SIP (Italian telco), Plessey, British Steel Corporation and BHP Steel real-time control of rolling steel mills, British Rail and London Underground for real-time train scheduling, London Fire Brigade and Durham Fire Brigade command and control systems, Suffolk Constabulary, and most of the National Videotex systems in the world including the Prestel viewdata service. At the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory a GEC 4000 system was used to control the synchrotron and injectors used for the ISIS neutron spallation source until 1998. A GEC 4080M was also used as the central processor for the radar system of the ill-fated Nimrod AEW.3 airborne early warning aircraft. CEGB also used GEC 4080 processors at three of their Grid Control Centres. Known as GI74 they were used to collect data from substations and display this on the wall diagrams and tabular VDUs.  Models  A number of variants of the GEC 4000 processor were produced, including (in approximate chronological order): * 4080: original 1973 model with 64‚Äì256 KiB of core memory * 4082: 4080 with up to 1 MiB of memory * 4070: entry-level model without memory interleaving * 4085: 4082 with semiconductor memory * 4060: entry-level model based on AMD Am2900 bit-slice processors * 4062/4065: 4060 supporting up to 1 MiB memory * 4080M: compact ruggedised 4080 for military applications * 4090: Am2900-based with 32-bit addressing extensions and up to 4 MiB of memory * 4190: revised 4090 with up to 16 MiB memory * 4180: cheaper, slower version of the 4190 (no memory cache, no fast multiply unit) * 4060M: compact ruggedised 4060 for military applications * 4160: 4065 with the 4090 32-bit addressing extensions * 4150: desktop 4160 * 4162: 4160 with DMAD IOP(s) for high speed communications controllers * 4195: compact 4190 * 4185: cheaper, slower version of the 4195 (no memory cache, no fast multiply unit) * 4151: rackmount 4150 * 4190D: dual-processor 4190 * 4193: 4195 with SCSI IOP replacing the default Normal Interface IOP * 4220: Reimplement 4190 using gate array processor technology * 4310: Motorola 88100 MVME187-based system emulating a GEC 4220  Software  Several operating systems were available for the GEC 4000 series, including the following: * COS: Core Operating System, for diskless real-time systems * DOS: Disk Operating System, for real- time systems, providing a filesystem and swapping facilities * OS4000: a multi-user system supporting batch and interactive use, and transaction processing * SCP-2: Secure Operating System (DOD A1/B3) Multilevel security Programming languages available included Babbage (a high-level assembly language), FORTRAN IV, CORAL 66, ALGOL, APL (programming language) and BASIC.

He is the only athlete to throw a javelin 100 metres or more, with his world record of . A new javelin design was implemented in 1986 and the records had to be restarted, thus Hohn's mark became an \\"eternal world record\\". Born in Neuruppin, Hohn excelled at the javelin throw from a young age and won the 1981 European Junior Championship with a throw of 86.56 m, a junior record. He then won gold at the 1982 European Championships with a 91.34 m throw. He did not compete at the 1983 World Championships and missed out on the 1984 Summer Olympics as East Germany had boycotted the games. He did however win gold at the Friendship Games, throwing 94.44 m (Arto H√§rk√∂nen won the 1984 Olympics with a throw of 86.76 m). In 1985, Hohn won the IAAF World Cup and European Cup but his career ended in 1986 after several setbacks due to a surgery. After his retirement from competition, Hohn became a coach and since 1999 he has worked for SC Potsdam, the successor of ASK Vorw√§rts Potsdam, where he started his career as a sportsman. World record On 20 July 1984, competing in the Olympic Day of Athletics competition at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, Berlin, Hohn threw the javelin a distance of . Hohn's throw shattered the previous world record of 99.72 m set by Tom Petranoff of the United States in May 1983. Contrary to popular myth, this was not the primary reason for the change in javelin design rules that came into force starting in 1986; the relevant change of moving the javelin's centre of gravity forward by four centimetres had already been officially proposed prior to Hohn's record throw, not only to shorten distances but also to get rid of the then frequent flat or ambiguous landings, which often made it hard to assess if a throw should be declared legal. However, Hohn's record-breaking throw accelerated the process as throws of his distance were in danger of going beyond the available space in normal stadiums. Coaching career Hohn has been a professional coach since 1999. Among others, Hohn has coached China's national champion Zhao Qinggang. Hohn is expected to sign the contract to coach the Indian javelin squad including Junior world record holder Neeraj Chopra till the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) confirmed the development, saying a proposal has been sent to the government for clearance and hoping the German expert will join the national squad as early as possible as said by AFI president Adille Sumariwalla. Personal life Hohn has been married since 1983 and has two children. He is tall and had a competition weight of 112 kg.

The film premiered on May 20 at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, in the Directors' Fortnight section. It ran for the Cam√©ra d'Or. Caramel was distributed in over 40 countries. The story focuses on the lives of five Lebanese women dealing with issues such as forbidden love, binding traditions, repressed sexuality, the struggle to accept the natural process of age, and duty versus desire. Labaki's film is unique for not showcasing a war-ravaged Beirut but rather a warm and inviting locale where people deal with universal issues. The title Caramel refers to an epilation method that consists of heating sugar, water and lemon juice. Labaki also symbolically implies the \\"idea of sweet and salt, sweet and sour\\" and showcases that everyday relations can sometimes be sticky but ultimately the sisterhood shared between the central female characters prevails.Screen Daily - News Synopsis Caramel revolves around the intersecting lives of five Lebanese women. Layale (Nadine Labaki) works in a beauty salon in Beirut along with two other women, Nisrine (Yasmine Al Massri) and Rima (Joanna Moukarzel). Each one has a problem: Layale is stuck in a dead-end relationship with a married man; Nisrine is no longer a virgin but is set to be married, and in her conservative family pre-marital sex is not accepted; Rima is attracted to women; Jamale (Gis√®le Aouad), a regular customer and wannabe actress, is worried about getting old; Rose (Sihame Haddad), a tailoress with a shop next to the salon, is an old woman who had devoted her life to taking care of her mentally unbalanced elder sister Lili (Aziza Semaan), but has found her first love. The film does not refer to any of the political problems or recent warfare that has troubled Lebanon. Rather, Labaki's tale paints everyday people with everyday problems. Cast *Nadine Labaki as Layale *Adel Karam as Youssef (The policeman) *Yasmine Al Massri as Nisrine *Joanna Moukarzel as Rima *Gis√®le Aouad as Jamal *Sihame Haddad as Rose *Aziza Semaan as Lili (Rose's older sister) *Fatmeh Safa as Siham (mysterious lady with long hair to whom Rima gets attracted) *Ismail Antar as Bassam (Nisrine's fianc√©) *Fadia Stella as Christine *Dimitri Staneofski as Charle Production Labaki chose to cast mostly non-professional actors. The shooting of Caramel ended just nine days before the Israel-Lebanon war erupted in July 2006 and was released in Cannes exactly one year after the shooting began. An old clothes shop in the Gemmayzeh area of Beirut District was transformed into a salon where the filming of the movie took place. Caroline Labaki, Nadine's sister, was the costume designer. The music was composed by Khaled Mouzanar. Shortly after the movie release, Labaki married him. Reception =Critical reception= The film received critical acclaim. , the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 92% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 77 reviews with an average rating of 7.1/10.

Plot Monica decides that she would like to get to know the neighbours in the apartment building better (to Chandler's dislike) and resorts to doing what she does best: cooking. She makes a batch of wonderful chocolates and hangs them on the door in a basket hoping that her neighbors will take some and they can meet. The neighbours (including Joey) eventually go crazy over the candy and demand more. Eventually, Chandler admonishes the neighbors for taking advantage of Monica's kindness and not making an effort to get to know her, and furiously sends them home. Ross gets Phoebe her first bike. Then the gang finds out she does not know how to ride. So Ross takes Phoebe to the park to teach her, but she's reluctant. With Ross' convincing and training wheels, Phoebe eventually manages to ride the bike. Rachel and her assistant Tag have started dating, but they strive to keep their relationship a secret from their workplace.

Legends Fidelis' cult is associated with Carpophorus and Exanthus, two soldier-saints. Variations on their legend are applied to Fidelis. The first says that he, with Carpophorus and Exanthus, were Roman soldiers, members of the legendary Theban Legion, who deserted during the persecution of Christians by Maximian. They were caught and executed at Como. The second says that Fidelis was an army officer who was guarding Christian prisoners at Milan, including Saint Alexander of Bergamo. He managed to procure the freedom of five of these prisoners. With Carpophorus and Exanthus, he and these five attempted to make their way to the Alps, but were executed at Como.Alban Butler, revised by Peter Doyle, Butler‚Äôs Lives of the Saints (Liturgical Press, 1996), 196. The martyrdom of Fidelis is considered to have occurred on the north side of Lake Como, near Samolaco. Veneration The Basilica of San Fedele in Como. The cult of Fidelis at Como is ancient.Alban Butler, Peter Doyle, Butler‚Äôs Lives of the Saints (Liturgical Press, 1996), 196. Magnus Felix Ennodius describes, in the early sixth century, a tomb at Como containing the relics of the martyr. Reports of miracles at the tomb fomented the popularity of his cult. Sometime before 1000, the church of Sanfedelino, which was dedicated to him, was built on the site of a much earlier simple chapel, which dates from around the fourth century. Milan, Como, and Arona claim the relics of Fidelis. Relics are said to have been transferred to Arona during a time of war between Milan and Como. In Arona, the presence of the relics of Fidelis and Carpophrous is attested in documents dating back to 1259 and 1321. Como's claim is based on an account of 964 that describes the translation of Fidelis' relics from the spot where he was killed to Como in that year.Alban Butler, Peter Doyle, Butler‚Äôs Lives of the Saints (Liturgical Press, 1996), 197. San Fedele in Milan. In 1576, Charles Borromeo transferred to Milan relics of Carpophorus and Fidelis. Though until then their veneration in Arona was minimal, Borromeo's proposed transfer angered the people of the city. As a compromise, Borromeo brought back to Arona the two left forearms of the saints. This occurred on March 13. The city council, which had been pressured by the populace to bring back the relics, decreed that an annual festival occur on that day, which in succeeding centuries has increased in importance. The purpose of the festival was extended to include the celebration for the martyrs Felinus and Gratian, thereby uniting their cult to that of Carpophorus and Fidelis. At Milan, Borromeo commissioned the church of San Fedele to Pellegrino Tibaldi (1559).

The club was founded in 1928. History Naomh Maur G.A.A. club is based in Rush, Fingal, North County Dublin. Rush is a farming and market gardening area, seventeen miles from Dublin City. Football was played in the area between local Parish Teams prior to the foundation of the G.A.A. in 1884. It is believed that a Club called \\"Emerald Isles\\" existed 1900, but there are no records to support this. After an unsuccessful attempt to set up a Club between 1914 and 1919, local Curate Fr. Skeehan organised football games in the local school. In 1928, two Garda√≠, Tom MacCarville and Peter Fallon, who were stationed in Rush, and local G.A.A enthusiast Mick Jones called a meeting. The meeting was held on 28 June 1928 and St. Maurs G.A.A Club was founded. Mick Jones was elected chairman. The club colours were a maroon jersey with a gold diagonal sash, which remain with the club to the present day. In the club's first year, it won the Division 3 Championship and progressed to win the Division 2 title in 1929‚Äì30. St. Maurs entered the Division 1 league in 1930 and subsequent to this the \\"Big team\\" or \\"A team\\" never played below this level. In 1936, the club embarked on a tour to Liverpool to play against a team of Irish farm workers, and St. Maurs won the game. Under the guidance of Mick Jones, the club had built a solid foundation and continued to grow. The 1940s were a quiet time, with many founding players \\"hanging up their boots\\", though giving assistance to their younger replacements. Pat Butterly succeeded Mick Jones as chairman in 1949 and did Trojan work with the young players. They qualified to play in the Dublin Junior Football Championship but lost. However, on 23 December 1951, they beat Skerries Harps in Parnell Park to give the club its first Dublin County Championship. This game is still spoken about as a huge crowd packed to Parnell Park to see the game. St. Maurs won by two points. A prominent player was S√©amus (Jim) McGuinnes, who progressed to the Dublin Senior Team where he became one of the finest footballers of that era. Injury cut short his Inter- County career, but not before he won a National League medal and played in the semi-final against Kerry. Liam (Willie) Price was elected chairman in 1950 and over the next forty-four years he led the club with great skill, style and dedication. After the club won the 1951 Championship, Price set to obtain a pitch; nine acres on the west side of the Parmer Estate were purchased from the Land Commission in 1958. With the willing hands of the Rush men, the field was turned into one of the finest pitches in Ireland. The pitch and new dressing rooms were opened in 1961 with Dublin and Kildare playing in a Senior Football Challenge. During the 1960s, the Club established a good Juvenile section and by the late 1960s things were taking shape. The 1970s brought a golden era to Naomh Maur. 1972 saw the Club win its second Dublin Junior Championship and in 1973 Senior status was achieved for the first time by winning the Intermediate title. The Club stayed Senior for eleven years and won a Senior League title during that time, but fell back to Intermediate football in 1985. In 1986, the Club qualified to play in Croke Park against a rejuvenated and star-studded Garda team which included Ashley Sullivan (Wicklow), Davy Byrne (Monaghan) and John McGrath (Tipperary). Naomh Maur won by 2‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì10. The final was against Round Towers of Lusk, which had a few relations playing against each other. The final was played in The Naul and a massive crowd were present for a superb game which St. Maurs won by 11 points to 6. During the club's first spell in Senior Football, the need for a Clubhouse was realised and √Åras Naomh Maur was opened in 1983. A huge amount of work was done by the Committee with the kindness and generosity of the people. The Club gained a top-class handball alley, squash court, three badminton courts, basketball court, kitchen, changing rooms, meeting rooms and a lounge bar. The Club remained Senior for a few years but slipped back to Intermediate football. The 1990s brought about many changes and a big juvenile policy from 1993 is aimed at returning the club to Senior football. 1994 saw the end of a forty-four-year term as chairman for Liam Price, who had done much for the association and Club. Liam is now Club President and ever-present at games. Brendan Harpur took over as chairman in 1994 and served for three very fruitful years, placing an emphases on juvenile development and coaching. A native of Tyrone, Brendan was the first person from outside the parish to hold executive office. Brendan is couch to our first football team. In 1997, Maureen Bollard took over the Chair of the Club for one year and spared no effort with her team. Maureen came from a great football background. Her father, Rupert Newcomen, played for St. Maurs and her uncles, Pat and Jackser, were voted players of their time. Jackser captained the 1951 Junior Championship winning team. S√©amus Carton, a native of Lusk, took over the Chair in 1998. He had been a noted hurler and goalkeeper of the 1972 and 1973 team, and a former Inter-County referee. He was soft-spoken and things were done without a fuss. S√©amus died during his term of office, which shook the Club. John Keely was elected chairman in 1998 for a three-year term, and showed boundless energy and enthusiasm. During his term of office, the club lounge was refurbished and a new development plan launched. The 1999‚Äì2000 season saw the club enter a Junior hurling team for the first time in the Dublin Adult League, and 2001 saw the club win the County Dublin Junior C Division 3 hurling title.

Plot House is returning from a pandemics symposium in Singapore with Cuddy. During the flight, a Korean man, Peng, sitting next to House begins vomiting. He also presents with fever, headache, abdominal pain and petechial rashes on his lower back. Cuddy notes that these are classic symptoms of meningococcal disease and that an outbreak might be imminent. House is not convinced there is a problem, and persuades the flight crew not to turn the plane around. Soon another passenger becomes ill with the same symptoms and House assembles a makeshift diagnostic team. After a discussion with his \\"team\\", House is convinced that both passengers are sick with ciguatera poisoning because they both ate seafood. This theory is contradicted by Cuddy, who is showing similar symptoms despite having not eaten the sea bass. Cuddy persuades House to do a lumbar puncture to confirm meningitis, but the test comes back negative. When Cuddy begins to shout at House to cure the sickness quickly, he realizes that she and the rest of the plane are suffering from mass hysteria. Peng, however, is still dying; House believes he is a drug mule and has cocaine in his system. Searching through Peng's wallet, House finds a scuba license and a receipt for scuba gear rental. Peng is diagnosed with decompression sickness, which was further worsened by boarding an airplane. Cuddy tells the flight crew to drop the plane below and get Peng oxygen. Meanwhile, at the hospital, a 58-year-old woman, Fran, has been admitted with unexplained seizures and vision loss. After lying about where she was, Fran admits that she just arrived from a trip to Caracas, where she had unprotected sex and used cocaine. Chase and Cameron visit Fran's house to search for clues, and return without a diagnosis, leaving Foreman to believe that Fran is bleeding into her brain. Chase realizes neither Fran nor her cat have eaten in the last few days, and discovers that when the neighbors had their home fumigated, some of the poison entered Fran's house. Fran is diagnosed with methyl bromide toxicity. At the end of the episode, Chase suggests that he and Cameron take their relationship to the next level. Cameron responds that all she was looking for was sex.

Weddle, \\"Carvajal Y De La Cueva, Luis De,\\" accessed 13 August 2016, http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fcadn He was a Portuguese-born, Spanish-Crown officer, who was awarded a large swath of territory in New Spain, known as Nuevo Reino de Le√≥n, in 1579. He was born in Mogadouro, Portugal, around 1537, but was raised in the Kingdom of Le√≥n, Spain at the home of the Count of Benavente, a contemporary and friend of Philip II, who named Carvajal Governor of Nuevo Reino de Le√≥n and granted him many privileges on the basis of previous services to the Spanish Crown. The territory granted to Carvajal included some portions in the south that had been settled by other Spaniards who refused to accept the terms of the grant and sued Carvajal before the highest court in New Spain. The suits were decided in favor of Carvajal, but √Ålvaro Manrique de Z√∫√±iga, marqu√©s de Villamanrique, viceroy of New Spain, ordered the arrest of Carvajal in 1588, charging that Carvajal was enslaving Indians. Carvajal was accused of several charges by the Inquisition in Mexico City, but only the charge of concealing that his relatives secretly practiced Judaism was upheld. Sentenced to exile, he was first sent back to the court's jail, where he died a year later. Background Carvajal was born circa 1537 in Mogadouro, Portugal, to Gaspar de Carvajal and Catalina de Le√≥n, descendants of Jewish conversos (converts to Catholicism). When he was eight years old, his family took him to Benavente, in the Spanish Kingdom of Le√≥n. There, he was placed, probably as a page, in the house of the Count of Benavente, where he learned the manners and language of a Spanish nobleman. He lived there until his maternal uncle, Duarte de Le√≥n, a wealthy Portuguese contractor sent him to the Portuguese islands of Cape Verde. There Carvajal learned a variety of skills, including navigation, accounting, and probably some military skills. In 1560, D. Sebastian, king of Portugal, named him treasurer for the assets of the deceased. In 1564, Carvajal left Cape Verde and went to Seville, where he married Guiomar Nu√±ez or Nunes, later known as Guitar de Ribera, the oldest daughter of Miguel Nu√±ez or Nunes, a Portuguese merchant stationed in Santo Domingo as an agent in the slave trade. By the time Carvajal married, his father-in-law was involved in the transportation of wheat, a lucrative business in those days. He joined the business for about two years, but abandoned it because of his ambitious plans. First sojourn in New Spain In 1567, Carvajal sailed for New Spain in his own ship as Admiral of a merchant fleet that sailed from the Canary Islands. Upon his arrival in Veracruz, he purchased a cattle hacienda near Tampico, and settled in that village, become its mayor the following year. In late 1568, Carvajal captured 78 Englishmen marooned on the Tamaulipas coast by John Hawkins, who had lost some of his ships in a fight with the Spanish fleet at Veracruz. In 1572, Viceroy Mart√≠n Enr√≠quez de Almanza commissioned Carvajal a captain, sending him to open a road through the mountains between the P√°nuco and Mazapil. This long expedition resulted in the discovery, by Carvajal, of a mountain pass that allowed him to achieve his goal and enabled him to discover the lands that later become Nuevo Reino de Le√≥n. After that expedition was completed, Carvajal was sent to chastise hostile Indian bands at the mouth of the R√≠o Bravo (Rio Grande). He claimed to have punished the natives responsible for the massacre of 400 castaways from three ships wrecked on the coast en route to and from Spain. During the campaign, he crossed the lower Rio Grande into what is now Texas. Due to his reputation as an Indian fighter, Viceroy Enr√≠quez de Almanza commissioned him in 1575 to join Capt. Francisco de Puga to pacify a large area north of Mexico City centered in Xalpa (present day Jalpan de Serra, Queretaro). The Indian tribes collectively known as Chichimecas had destroyed the Catholic missions in the area. Carvajal, using Indian labor, built a fort and resettled a large number of \\"pacified\\" Indians near the fort, a policy known in Spanish Latin America as reductions. However, whatever victories he achieved did not endure as the local Indians, the Pames, soon resumed the war. During this period, Carvajal continued his business dealings by trading in slaves and cochineal.Cohen, Martin A. (2001), The Martyr Luis de Carvajal, Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, pp. 50-51 In 1578, after obtaining an endorsement from the viceroy and the Audiencia de M√©xico for his desire to be granted an important official charge by the king he went to Spain. After lengthy negotiations in the Consejo de Indias, on 31 May 1579 he succeeded in obtaining his desired post, and was awarded a large territory that was to be named Nuevo Reino de Le√≥n. From South to North that territory extended from Tampico to just below present day Dallas, Texas. A similar distance extended East to west. Among the privileges granted to Carvajal by the king was that he could recruit, in Spain, up to 100 males, sixty of whom should be married, to be the first colonizers of his Nuevo Reino. Because of time limitations, the king ordered that the requirement that each should show proof of being an Old Christian be waived. This was not the only time the king did so, but it did result in the recruitment of several New Christians, including Carvajal's sister, Francisca de Carvajal, and her family, all of whom were later found to secretly practice Judaism and were burnt at the stake by the Spanish Inquisition in Mexico City. Carvajal was also instructed to civilize, pacify, and Christianize the Indians in his domain, but forbidden to enslave them, an injunction he \\"never obeyed\\" in the words of a Mexican essayist.Cadena, Raul,\\"Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva\\", rcadena.net; accessed 13 August 2016. Second sojourn in New Spain In 1579 Phillip II, King of Spain, granted him the title of governor and captain- general with the mission to \\"discover, pacify and settle\\" a new province in New Spain to be called Nuevo Reino de Le√≥n, 200 leagues inland from the port of Tampico. The people recruited by Carvajal in Spain and Portugal were transported to the New world in a ship, an urca, owned by Carvajal and named La Urca de Panuco. The urca left Seville on 10 June 1580 and arrived in Tampico on 24 August of the same year. The following October he went to Mexico City to present his credentials to the new viceroy, the Count of Coru√±a. In consideration of the appointment of governor, Carvajal undertook to colonize the territory at his own expense, being allowed to repay himself out of the revenues. His original jurisdiction was to comprise a somewhat ill-defined territory, beginning at the port of Tampico, extending along the River P√°nuco, and thence turning northward; but it was not to exceed 200 leagues either way. It would seem to have included Tamaulipas, as well as the states of Nuevo Le√≥n and Coahuila, and parts of San Luis Potos√≠, Zacatecas, Durango, Chihuahua and Texas. Towards the end of 1581, Carvajal started to settle the lesser-known parts of his territory, founding, as required by his capitulaci√≥n with the king, several villages. On 10 December 1581, he founded Villa de la Cueva de Le√≥n, no longer in existence, and in April 1582 he founded, as a city, Ciudad de Le√≥n, now Cerralvo. About the same time he ordered his captain (and later Lieutenant) Gaspar Casta√±o de Sosa to found Villa de San Luis, now Monterrey, the capital of the modern Mexican state of Nuevo Le√≥n. Casta√±o de Sosa is also known as the leader of the first attempt to establish a Spanish settlement in New Mexico. The attempt failed and Casta√±o de Sosa was arrested and punished by Spanish authorities for his unauthorized expedition. As mentioned earlier, the territory granted to Carvajal by Philip II included lands that were contested by other Spaniards living in New Spain. These individuals sued Carvajal in the highest court in New Spain -The Audiencia de M√©xico. Lasting more than three years these legal suits were decided in favor of Carvajal. But the litigants did not give up. Taking advantage of a sympathetic prosecutor and of the arrival of a new viceroy, they argued that Carvajal was enslaving pacified Indians. =Arrest and trial= In late 1588, Carvajal was arrested at Almad√©n (present day Monclova), which he had established allegedly as a base to carry out slaving raids. Taken to Mexico City, he was imprisoned. Spanish authorities said the Carvajal had a gang of \\"more than sixty soldiers\\" and to have made a fortune capturing and selling Indian slaves. They raided north along the Rio Grande, capturing hundreds of Indians whom they sold into slavery.Hammond, George P. and Rey, Apapito, The Rediscovery of New Mexico, 1580-1594, Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1966, 297; Flint, Richard and Flint, Shirley Cushing, \\"Juan Morlete, Gaspar Castano de Sosa, and the Province of Nuevo Le√≥n.\\" , accessed 19 December 2010 But the government was attempting to find a peaceful solution to the long-running and bloody Chichimeca War. Enslavement was one of the grievances of the Indians and a peaceful solution involved protecting the Indians against slavers. All along the frontier two successive Viceroys promoting peace with the Chichimecas cracked down on the slavers.Powell, Philip Wayne. Soldiers, Indians, and Silver: The Northward Advance of New Spain, 1550-1600. Berkeley: U of CA Press, 1952, 197-198 New charges were also brought against Carvajal. This was based on the accusations that Carvajal's ancestors were New Christians, which contradicted the \\"Purity of Blood\\" laws required to obtain permission to settle in the New Spain. This was sufficient to have Carvajal transferred to the jails of the Inquisition. Although several charges against him were initially mentioned - including enslaving Native Americans, only the charge of covering up the practicing Judaism of his sister and her children remained. In the end he was sentenced to a six-year exile in an auto-da-fe held on 24 February 1590 in Mexico City. However, before the sentence was carried out, he was sent back to the jail of the Court, where he died, nearly one year later, on 13 February 1591.

Rieger Memorial Highway) is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of Washington. It is split into two sections in Clark County, a north-south alignment connecting Interstate 5 (I-5) in Vancouver to the Port of Vancouver and the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge, and a west-east alignment connecting Ridgefield to I-5. Prior to the 1964 highway renumbering, SR 501 was designated as Secondary State Highway 1T (SSH 1T), established in 1937 and re-aligned to serve the Port of Vancouver in 1963. Route description =Southern section= I-5 in Downtown Vancouver The southern section of SR 501 and the Erwin O. Rieger Memorial Highway begins as the four-lane Mill Plain Boulevard at a diamond interchange with I-5 in Downtown Vancouver. The highway travels west through Downtown Vancouver and splits into a one-way pair on Mill Plain Boulevard and 15th Street before rejoining as Mill Plain Boulevard. SR 501 crosses a BNSF rail yard and enters the Port of Vancouver, becoming the Lower River Road and narrowing to a two-lane highway on the south side of Vancouver Lake. The highway follows the Columbia and Lake rivers north past the Shillapoo Wildlife Recreation Area, ending south of Post Office Lake in the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 501 overall was west of I-5 at C Street, serving 13,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section of SR 501 overall was south of Shillapoo Wildlife Recreation Area, serving 650 vehicles. Between I-5 and the Port of Vancouver, SR 501 is designated as part of WSDOT's Highway of Statewide Significance, which include interstate highways and other principal arterials that are needed to connect major communities in the state of Washington. =Northern section= Downtown Ridgefield The northern section of SR 501 within Ridgefield begins as Pioneer Street at an intersection with Main Avenue at the Ridgefield City Hall. The highway travels east through Downtown Ridgefield, passing View Ridge Middle School, before crossing over Gee Creek. SR 501 continues east through two roundabouts, at 45th Avenue and 56th Place, before ending at a diamond interchange with I-5. Every year, WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of AADT, which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of the northern section was the I-5 interchange, serving 11,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section was the intersection with Main Street in Downtown Ridgefield, serving 3,200 vehicles. History SSH 1T was created in 1937 during the formation of the primary and secondary state highways, traveling on a route north from Primary State Highway 1 (PSH 1) and U.S. Route 99 (US 99) in Vancouver through Felida and Ridgefield to PSH 1 and US 99 at Pioneer. The highway was extended into Vancouver in the 1950shttps://www.newspapers.com/clip/24415055/ssh_1t_extension_in_vancouver/ and re-aligned in 1963 to serve the Port of Vancouver, traveling along the Columbia River to Ridgefield west of Vancouver Lake onto a roadway that was to be constructed. The state highway commission realigned the highway onto a pair of one-way streets within Vancouver in late 1968.https://cdm16977.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16977coll1/id/5469/rec/1 The first section of the Columbia River section was completed in 1969, but the remainder never left the design phase. SSH 1T became SR 501 during the 1964 highway renumbering and codified as such in 1970, being designated as the Erwin O. Rieger Memorial Highway in 1991. In the late 1990s, Mill Plain Boulevard was extended west from downtown Vancouver to the industrial area west of the railyard to serve the Port of Vancouver. The $35 million project was dedicated on September 30, 2000, and incorporated into SR 501. The section of the highway between the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge and the city of Ridgefield has never been constructed and remains as a physical gap in the state highway system. The interchange between I-5 and SR 501 east of Ridgefield was rebuilt by WSDOT between 2010 and 2012, adding roundabouts at intersections west and east of the interchange as well. On July 14, 2015, WSDOT permanently closed the northern of SR 501's southern section due to the Columbia River reclaiming the highway. That part of the highway was relinquished to Clark County in 2016. Eventually, that section was vacated to surrounding property owners.

The company became notable for its fountain pens, although it also produced ballpoint pens. Conway Stewart was placed in receivership in 2014, with its stocks and assets acquired by Bespoke British Pens Ltd., which owns the rights to the brand since then. Nowadays, a wide range of fountain pens with the \\"Conway Stewart\\" brand are manufactured and marketed by Bespoke British Pens.British luxury pens on BBP website  History  Jarvis and Garner had previously worked for the De La Rue Company, the leading British fountain pen manufacturer of the time. Drawing on the experience they had gained at De La Rue, the two started their own business, initially reselling fountain pens manufactured by other companies. The name \\"Conway Stewart\\" was apparently derived from a popular music hall act of the time. The fountain pen market in Britain at that time was dominated by De La Rue and it was clear to Jarvis and Garner that only a very limited market share could be gained by reselling un-branded fountain pens. At the same time, De La Rue was embarking on a substantial marketing campaign by re-branding its products \\"Onoto\\". Jarvis and Garner identified a market niche for attractive and reliable writing instruments at an affordable price. The 1920s saw rapid development of the Conway Stewart product line. Pens of several different types of filling mechanisms, materials and sizes were offered for sale. The business model proved successful for Conway Stewart and its market share increased at the expense of other established manufacturers. As a result, Conway Stewart had outgrown its initial premises and in 1927 the company relocated to a larger facility which would serve as its home for the next two decades. During the depression years, the company was able to remain profitable, helped by the public's perception of good value products. In 1935, Conway Stewart went public, raising additional capital at the same time by offering shares. The years of World War II proved difficult for Conway Stewart and many other manufacturers; there were shortages of materials but the company managed to survive by continuing to offer good reliable pens at reasonable prices. Emerging from post-war austerity in Britain, the 1950s proved to be golden years for Conway Stewart, with the creative use of coloured plastic reaching its peak. The company once again relocated to new premises, but the golden age proved to be short-lived. At the same time, the ballpoint pen was being developed and while initially unreliable and more expensive than comparably finished fountain pens, soon decreased rapidly in price. Conway Stewart, along with most other fountain pen manufacturers of the time, failed to anticipate the effect that this innovative product would have on fountain pen sales. In the 1960s, fountain pen sales declined very quickly and Conway Stewart began to feel the effect of falling revenues. The company tried to compete by offering lower priced fountain pens and also introduced ballpoint pens to its range. The company relocated to Crumlin, Caerphilly in Wales in 1968, taking advantage of regional development grants, but its financial health continued to deteriorate. In 1975, the company was wound-up and production ceased. The company was revived in the 1990s, with headquarters in Plymouth, England. Sales started in 1998, although some models had been produced for special occasions before that, including for the Heads of State attending the 1998 G8 Summit in Birmingham. On 28 August 2014, the company was placed in receivership. The remaining stock, as well as the machinery and tooling, were sold off and its offices closed. Bespoke British Pens went on to acquire the stock of components from the Conway Stewart factory.History of Conway Stewart from Bespoke British Pens. Retrieved 12 February 2018 On 11 November 2014, Mr Caltagirone Emmanuel registered the trademark Conway Stewart for the USA.  Models  = 1905‚Äì1975 = Conway Stewart fountain pens from the 1950s Early models marketed by Conway Stewart were sourced from other manufacturers, were made of hard rubber and were indistinguishable from many other pens available at that time. By the mid-1920s, the company was establishing its own design style, helped by the use of colourful celluloid and casein plastics. Conway Stewart's model designation is a combination of names and numbers. Important named models with approximate age ranges include: * 1920s ‚Äì 1960s: Dinkie (540‚Äì550) * 1930s ‚Äì 1940s: Duro (various numbers), Dandie (720, 728), Scribe (336), International (356), Universal (470, 479) During the 1940s, model names were dropped for all product lines apart from the Dinkie. The model numbering is not chronological and the same pen may appear with a different numbers depending on whether it was sold in Britain or exported. Major model numbers include: * 1920s ‚Äì 1940s: 200, 217, 286, 380, 388 * 1950s ‚Äì early 1960s: 12, 14, 15, 16, 22, 27, 28, 36, 58, 60, 73‚Äì77, 84, 85, 100, * early 1960s ‚Äì 1975: 65‚Äì69, 94‚Äì98, 107 The plastics of the 1940s to 1960s were produced in a variety of styles and colours and while never specifically named by Conway Stewart, they have become known informally by collectors by names such as cracked ice, herringbone, tiger‚Äôs eye and crosshatch and the more common marbled finish. Of particular note is the model 22 which was produced in the 1950s in a floral pattern. This was produced in very small numbers compared to other models of the time. There is some uncertainty as to the number produced; estimates range from 200 to 2000. After the early 1960s injection moulded plastic of a uniform colour was used for the manufacture of pens. Nibs, which had been 14ct gold until this time, were generally replaced by stainless steel. = 1990s‚Äìpresent = Models produced in this era are made for the \\"high-end\\" of the market and feature precious metals, enamels and casein or celluloid plastics and 18ct gold nibs. Notable models include the Churchill. 58 series, the Duro series, the Dinkie series and the 100 series, all styled after the original models. The Churchill being based on the larger red ripple hard rubber versions from the vintage conway stewarts. The brand was purchased by Don Yendle over a period of 3 years from 1994 to 1997. The Conway Stewart trademark in the UK was purchased by Helix from the liquidators in 1975. The trademark was then purchased by another company with a view to relaunching the brand on a range of fibre tipped pen for the mass market, only limited numbers were produced and in 1994 Don Yendle purchased the UK tradename from the company. The USA trademark was purchased from Stuart Edwards of Palo Alto in 1994. In 1995 Don Yendle met with the directors of Shaeffer Australia who had registered the name with a view to relaunching a cheap range of Chinese pens for the Australian market. A meeting was held in Hong Kong in early 1995 whereby Don Yendle purchased the rights to the CS tradename for Australia. Having formed Conway Stewart as a Limited Company in the UK the trademark was registered in Europe and Asia to ensure worldwide security for the brand. Having researched Conway Stewarts previous manufacturing history and techniques Don Yendle wanted to keep true to its core values from 1905. What followed were 3 years of research into Casein and plastics including vulcanite for barrels and feeders for nibs. The company even used a Birmingham-based company who still used a 1-metre pantograph to make the miniature moulds for the pen clips in order to keep the detail in the clips. All of the new clips were exactly the same size as the originals so pen collectors would have spares for the vintage pens they wished to repair. After much experimentation with slabs of casein from uk and some very old stock from Japan Conway Stewart re-launched in 1997. At that first exhibition the Foreign Office chose Conway Stewart as a supplier of gifts for Number 10 Downing Street and gifts from the government to visiting dignitaries. The first collections (58 series and Dinkies) were all made from casein with solid gold rings swaged on to each cap. Each slab of casein had to be cured for at least 3 months in drying room with just the right humidity. Returning the barrels to the drying room after each process in order to train the material to be 'round'. Each collection was limited to 500 pcs based on material and colour. Each pen code and number laser engraved on to each barrel. The company then introduced designs (Churchill series, 58, Dinkie) in acrylic, solid silver, and solid gold. The first solid gold pens were made for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth and HRH Prince Philip on the celebration of their golden wedding anniversary 20 November 1997. Two pieces were made in 18ct solid gold. The queen wrote a letter of thanks for the gift stating they were 'useful to boot'. The pens were originally made in Horrabridge and the company moved to its Plymouth premises in 2001 having outgrown the original premises. The company continued to produce pens for the Prime Ministers Office, supplying birthday presents of a Conway Stewart Churchill to Bill Clinton, George Bush, Jacques Chirac, Vladimir Putin to name but a few. The pens were also selected by the Foreign Office as gifts to all world leaders at the G8 and G20 summits, along with pens for Prince Charles, Princess Diana and Barbara Cartland. Conway Stewart introduced a few prototype celluloid pens, mainly as overlays on solid silver Duro pens. The company supplied another set of gold pens for the celebration of Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee featuring a hard rubber Churchill with an 18ct Overlay. Only a few pieces were sold. Don Yendle sold the company to an investor in October 2003 having established worldwide distribution.

This school is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami History Named for Monsignor Pace the first native-born Floridian to become a diocesan priest, the first all-male, freshmen and sophomore classes commenced in September 1961 in the old parish hall of Our Lady of Perpetual Help on NW 28th Avenue in Opa- Locka under the direction of Marist Brothers from Cuba and New York. Classes moved to buildings at the school's present site in October 1961. All-female classes were added the next year under the direction of the women of the Teresian Association. The original mascot was the Lion, and the colors were green and white, but students voted in the third school year to change the mascot to the Spartan, and the colors to scarlet and gold. The first class of 32 graduated in 1964 at the present day Jackie Gleason Auditorium. Pace's first graduating class created the first newspaper, called the Kerygma (\\"The Proclamation\\") as well as the first Torch yearbook, which acquired its name from president John F. Kennedy's inauguration speech, in which he referred to passing the \\"torch\\" to the next generation. Pace's school seal was also designed that year to be engraved on the class rings, and the school's motto was chosen as well. It was in the 1964-1965 school year that the tradition of \\"Freshmen Orientation,\\" began in which seniors essentially 'hazed' freshmen, in a tradition that continues to this day, but in a milder form. The first co- institutional class graduated in 1966, the same year in which the school's alma mater, Gratia et Veritas, was composed. Just one year later, the first football team was formed and the school celebrated its first football Homecoming Week, after having had several Spirit Weeks for the basketball team. By 1969, the school already had seven buildings, including five academic buildings, a field house, and an on-campus residence for the Teresian Association, which switch homes with the Marist brothers just three years later for a home they felt better suited their lifestyle. The first state championship was won in 1971 by the Cross Country team, in time for a banner to be hung in the new gymnasium, constructed in that school year, along with the adjoining cafeteria. By the 1974-1975 year, after several years of gender- mixing in classes such as math and science, the school became officially co- educational. The first senior trip to Canada took place four years later in February 1979, becoming a tradition for every senior class after it. In Homecoming of 1979, the first King was chosen by the student body, and the Powderpuff game in which boys cheered and girls played flag football, was introduced five years later. Pace celebrated its 25th anniversary in the 1985-1986 school year, and the 25th senior class graduated in 1988. Tons of Love, an annual fall food drive, began in 1987, the first year of the L.I.F.E. (Living In Faith Experience) youth group, a key component of the Campus Ministry Program. In the early 1990s, Pace underwent several facility improvements, such as outdoor lockers, school-wide air conditioning, and renovated science labs. The gym was renovated in 1997 and renamed for Brother Felix Anthony, a Marist brother who served as a teacher and basketball coach from 1965 to 1988. Pace's cafetorium, the Spartan Center, was completed in that same year after three years of construction, and the newest classroom building (500) was finished in 1999. In 2002, the school was named a Blue Ribbon School of Excellence at the end of its 40th Anniversary year, and the 40th class graduated just a year later in 2003. The school was a named one of the Top 50 Catholic High Schools in this period as well and received an award for Catholic Identity in 2004. After far outgrowing the \\"old chapel\\" found in the school's first building, a new building, the Dantee Navarro Religious Education Center, was completed in 2008 and can hold 500 people, although masses are still held in the gymnasium. It was in that same year that Pace was named the first official \\"green school\\" in South Florida by instituting a recycling program and initiating changes across campus, from lighting to landscaping. Pace celebrated its 50th anniversary in the 2011-2012 school year, and its 50th class graduated in 2013.

United States, the first freedom of religion case to issue from that court. Early life Reynolds was born in Marylebone, England, to George Reynolds and Julia Ann Tautz. He spent much of his childhood under the care of his maternal grandmother. His grandmother employed a maid, Sarah White, who invited nine-year-old Reynolds to attend a meeting of the LDS Church with her. Reynolds received permission from his grandmother to do so; Reynolds attended a sacrament meeting of the church's Paddington Branch with White, and almost immediately decided that he wished to become a member. However, Reynolds's parents refused to allow him to be baptized a member of the church. Often, he would evade his parents' wishes and attend the Sunday meetings in Paddington. When Reynolds was 14 years old, he attended the church's Somers Town Branch, where he was unknown, and asked to be received into the church by baptism. Not knowing that Reynolds' parents had forbidden the action, the branch president, George Teasdale, baptized him on May 4, 1856; Reynolds was confirmed a member of the church by Teasdale on May 11, 1856. In December 1856, Reynolds was given the Aaronic priesthood and ordained to the office of deacon. He was responsible for opening the doors to the Sunday meetinghouse for the Somers Town Branch and organizing the seating in preparation for sacrament meeting. In May 1857, at the age of 15, Reynolds was ordained to the office of priest. Reynolds engaged in open-air preaching in the streets of London, usually with an adult elder of the church. After Reynolds began street preaching, his parents discovered that he had become a Latter-day Saint. In August 1860, Reynolds was given the Melchizedek priesthood and ordained to the office of elder. In May 1861, he was called to be a full-time missionary of the church in London. In 1863, Reynolds was reassigned as a missionary to the Liverpool area to work as a clerk for church apostle and mission president George Q. Cannon. When Cannon returned to the United States later that year, Reynolds retained his position as a clerk under the new mission president, apostle and counselor in the First Presidency, Daniel H. Wells. As mission clerk, one of the primary responsibilities Reynolds had was organizing and coordinating the efforts to assist European church members in emigrating to Utah Territory, where the headquarters of the church were located. While acting as mission clerk, Reynolds was asked to serve as the branch president of the Liverpool Branch. Life in America In May 1865, Reynolds was released as a missionary and invited to emigrate to Utah Territory. He traveled to Salt Lake City with fellow elders of the church, William S. Godbe and William H. Sherman, arriving on July 5, 1865. On July 22, 1865, mere weeks after his arrival in Utah, Reynolds married his first wife, Mary Ann Tuddenham. Soon afterwards, LDS Church president Brigham Young hired Reynolds as secretary to the First Presidency. Reynolds was ordained to the priesthood office of seventy by Israel Barlow on March 18, 1866. In February 1869, Reynolds was elected by the legislature of the Utah Territory to be a member of the board of regency of the University of Deseret, which was later renamed the University of Utah. Reynolds was re-elected to this position by the legislature a number of times. In May 1871, Young asked Reynolds to return to England to assist apostle Albert Carrington in the publication of the Millennial Star, a church newspaper for British Latter-day Saints. Reynolds did so, and in September of that year Carrington was required to return to the United States, leaving Reynolds as the de facto president of the church's European Mission. However, Reynolds was suffering from ill health due to a severe case of smallpox, and when Carrington returned in May 1872, Reynolds was sent home to Utah to recover. Like many early Latter-day Saints, Reynolds practiced the religious principle of plural marriage. On August 3, 1874, Reynolds married his second wife, Amelia Jane Schofield. At this time, Young continued to employ Reynolds as the secretary to the First Presidency and also appointed him to be the manager of the Salt Lake Theatre. In 1875, Reynolds was elected as a member of the Salt Lake City Council. Party to polygamy test case In 1874, strong efforts were being made to prosecute Latter-day Saints who practiced polygamy in violation an 1862 Morrill Anti- Bigamy Act. Confident that the law would be declared to be an unconstitutional violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the leaders of the church agreed to furnish a defendant for a test case. Young asked Reynolds if he would be willing to serve as the test defendant. Reynolds agreed and was indicted for bigamy by a grand jury on June 23, 1874. Because it was a test case the church wished to pursue before the United States Supreme Court, Reynolds cooperated with investigators and the trial court, supplying the witnesses and testimony that proved he was married to two women at the same time. Reynolds was found guilty by a jury on April 1, 1875, and was sentenced to one year's imprisonment and a fine of five hundred dollars. On appeal, the indictment was overturned by the Utah Territory's Supreme Court because the grand jury had not been empanelled in compliance with the Poland Act. Thus, for the test case to proceed, Reynolds had to be reindicted and retried. On October 30, 1875, Reynolds was indicted a second time; he was found guilty of bigamy by a jury on December 9 and sentenced to two years imprisonment of hard labor and a fine of five hundred dollars. On June 13, 1876, the Utah Supreme Court upheld the conviction. The stage was set for the case to be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. =Reynolds v. United States= Arguments were heard in the Reynolds case before the United States Supreme Court on November 14, 1878. On January 6, 1879, the Court issued its unanimous decision for Reynolds v. United States. The court rejected his argument that the Latter-day Saint practice of plural marriage was protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution. Thus, his conviction was upheld, as was the constitutionality of the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act. (The court did rule that the hard labor clause of his sentence was not permitted by law; as a result, this clause of his sentence was lifted.) =Imprisonment= Reynolds had been imprisoned in Utah since his second conviction was confirmed by the Utah Supreme Court in June 1876. After his failed appeal to the Supreme Court, Reynolds was transferred from a jail in Utah to the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln, where he became U.S. Prisoner Number 14 and was appointed to be the bookkeeper in the knitting department. Reynolds only remained in the Nebraska penitentiary for 25 days, after which he was transferred to the Utah Territory Penitentiary, where regulations were more primitive and vermin more abundant. Reynolds reported that the prisoners were not permitted to have a fire for fear that the prison would burn down; as a result, on many winter mornings he would awake and his beard would be one solid mass of ice. Reynolds was released from prison on January 20, 1881, having served his full sentence, less five months for good behavior. He was pardoned in 1894 by U.S. President Grover Cleveland. Life after release from prison Upon his release from prison, Reynolds resumed his position as secretary to the First Presidency; he also became an active organizer within the Deseret Sunday School Union (DSSU), acting as the editor of and writing many articles for its publication, the Juvenile Instructor. From 1899 until his death in 1909, Reynolds was a first or second assistant to three general superintendents of the DSSU: From 1899 to 1901, he was the second assistant to George Q. Cannon; in 1901 he was first assistant to Lorenzo Snow; and from 1901 until 1909 he was first assistant to Joseph F. Smith. On April 25, 1885, Reynolds married his third and final wife, Mary Goold. His first wife, Mary Ann, died on December 17, 1885, following the birth of a child. In 1890, LDS Church president Wilford Woodruff asked Reynolds to become one of the seven members of the First Council of Seventy, a calling in the church hierarchy that ranked just below the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Reynolds agreed, and on April 10, Reynolds was set apart to this position by Lorenzo Snow, who was then president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Reynolds continued in this position and as the secretary to the First Presidency until his death in 1909. Reynolds was a gifted writer and after his release from prison he became active in writing religious literature. His most famous works are his Story of the Book of Mormon (1888), which was intended for children; Complete Concordance to the Book of Mormon (1900); and Dictionary of the Book of Mormon (1910). Reynolds suffered a nervous breakdown in 1907 as a result of stress incident from overwork. He died from meningitis at Salt Lake City on August 9, 1909, at the age of 67.State of Utah Death Certificate Reynolds had three wives and 32 children. One of his daughters married Joseph Fielding Smith. Published works     * See also *1890 Manifesto *Alice Louise Reynolds *Edmunds Act *Edmunds‚ÄìTucker Act *Reed Smoot hearings *Ruth H.

It was founded as Grace Livingston Hill Memorial School in 1953. It had an enrollment of around 650 students in 2007. It has an interdenominational student body, mostly of Protestant background. The campus spans , set among tall oak trees reminiscent of its once rural surroundings, and is about half of a mile outside Seminole, Florida, whose city council annexed the school into its city limits in 2000.Norton, Wilma (July 13, 2000). \\"School's Growth Concerns Neighbors.\\" St Petersburg Times.

Founding  Following a temporary location started with help from Roy Gustafson and her other friends at \\"the Baptist Church on 22nd Avenue South\\" in St. Petersburg in 1952, Ruth Munce founded Grace Livingston Hill Memorial School in 1953, naming it after her mother, an author of more than 100 Christian-themed romance novels.Miller, Betty Jean (May 30, 1988). \\"Unhappy with Public Education, She Founded a Christian School.\\" St.Petersburg Times. Retrieved April 5, 2007, from Lexis Nexis Academic. Munce felt called by God to establish this private educational facility because no other Christian school existed in Pinellas County, so she purchased a site, an old chicken farm off Seminole Boulevard on the outskirts of St. Petersburg, Florida. Munce's philosophy that \\"God would be the sum of the equation, the Bible a textbook\\" was put into motion. Classes were held in the chicken house and log cabin-style farmhouse.Rosen, Christine (January 3, 2006).Book Excerpt: \\"My Fundamentalist Education\\". Retrieved April 7, 2007. Munce taught Bible and English courses and remained principal of the school for 15 years, bringing enrollment to as many as 200 students a year. In 1968, at age 70, she undertook an eight-year stint teaching at Nairobi Bible Institute in Kenya.Basse, Craig (April 25, 2001). Keswick School Founder Dies at 103. St. Petersburg Times. Retrieved April 3, 2007.  Name change and growth  Headquartered on the same site as the school were Keswick radio stations, WKES-FM and WGNB AM, and the Southern Keswick Bible Conference. Bill Caldwell operated these facilities, and to him, Munce turned over the school in 1961. The following year, the school name was changed to Keswick Christian School to reflect its new ownership. The Keswick name is said to come from a holiness movement that originated in Keswick, England, in the late nineteenth century. By 1970, the school's enrollment rose to 480 students, giving the board of directors ample reason to expand the school to offer a senior high, which was completed in 1975 with the first senior class graduating in 1978. Also around this time, the school became a mission of Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, an affiliation that lasted 18 years. Moving into the 1980s, school officials broke ground in February 1983 for constructing a new library, but to do so, part of Keswick's history was removed. The early log-cabin farmhouse, where Keswick's first classes were held, was partially demolished, Leaving only one room, maintained for elementary music classes. The library was named Ruth Munce Library after the school's founder.Laurenzo, Catherine, ed. Tradition: Crusader 1983 Yearbook, p. 76. In the early 1990s, the Upham Music Building was constructed to better accommodate band and choral instruction and rehearsal.  Parting ways with Moody  In 1996, Moody Bible Institute decided that their future focus would be solely on higher education, so the college amicably parted ways with Keswick. Moody sold its conference center property, established in 1962 on Lake Kersky, including a 48-room lodge, a 550-seat chapel and three homes, to Keswick for $600,000. The radio station remained the property of Moody. A fundraising campaign ensued to fund the purchase;Norton, Wilma (December 15, 1995). Keswick, Moody Parting Ways. St. Petersburg Times. Retrieved April 6, 2007, from Lexis Nexis Academic. however, this was only the beginning of the school's endeavors to reach new goals through a capital campaign.  Foundations for the future  In 1999, school officials announced their expansion plans to add a two-story building that would house administrative offices, classrooms and a state-of-the-art media center.Byrne, Maureen (November 12, 2001). \\"Keswick Abandons Plan for Building.\\" St. Petersburg Times. Retrieved April 9, 2007, from Lexis Nexis Academic The following year, the Seminole city council changed the school's unincorporated status with Pinellas County, annexing it into Seminole city limits. At a Seminole city council meeting in July 2000, neighbors of the school aired their grievances concerning the expansion. They argued the proposed building would change the look of the neighborhood and generate more traffic and noise. This council meeting, however, was not to discuss the school's expansion but to decide its request for rezoning it from residential status to public/semipublic status. The re-designation was granted after tough debate. In 2001, Keswick officials scrapped the plan for the large, two-story building; instead, minor modifications were made, such as installing a fence on the grounds along 54th Avenue, building a paved running track, improving drainage and paving dirt parking lots. Despite the false start, Keswick embarked on a three-year capital campaign called Foundations for the Future in 2003, the fiftieth anniversary of the school. The $4.5 million campaign was completed in 2007. Highlights of the campaign include a new senior high school building; a refurbished preschool and new two-year-old program; and a relocated junior high building.

Route description I-5. SR 502 begins as the four-lane Battle Ground Highway at exit 11 on I-5, a trumpet interchange located north of Mount Vista, and travels due east as 219th Street, crossing Gee Creek and passing the northbound Gee Creek rest area. The four-lane highway travels east through rural Clark County and the community of Dollars Corner before it enters the city of Battle Ground, where it becomes Main Street. SR 502 crosses over Mill Creek and travels through the city, ending at an intersection with SR 503 and Main Street. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 8,200 and 26,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly within Battle Ground. The entire route is designated as part of the National Highway System, which includes roadways important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. History SSH 1S was created in 1937 during the formation of the primary and secondary state highways, traveling on a route east from Primary State Highway 1 (PSH 1) and U.S. Route 99 (US 99) north of Mount Vista to intersect SSH 1U in Battle Ground and turned north towards Amboy and west to end at PSH 1 and US 99 in Woodland. After PSH 1 and US 99 was realigned onto a four-lane limited-access highway in the late 1940s, SSH 1S was extended south over the old highway to intersect PSH 1 and US 99. SR 502 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering and codified in 1970 as the successor to the Mount Vista-Battle Ground section of SSH 1S, while US 99 was replaced by I-5. WSDOT constructed a new interchange between I-5 and 219th Street between April 2007 and October 2008 at a cost of $52 million. The new interchange and subsequent realignment shortened the total length of SR 502 by , however, the mileposts were not updated, . During construction of the interchange, WSDOT uncovered archaeological remains belonging to a Coast Salish settlement at Gee Creek that were at least 8,000 years old. The entire highway was christened the \\"Battle Ground Highway\\" in May 2009 to signify the importance of SR 502 connecting the city of Battle Ground to I-5. WSDOT began preparing to install a median barrier and widen SR 502 to four lanes between the I-5 interchange and the western Battle Ground city limit in July 2012 to accommodate increasing traffic on the highway, which has a speed limit up to . Construction for the $85 million project began in earnest in 2014. New Mill Creek wetlands were created, to mitigate for wetlands buried by construction, which included the driving of 1,200 concrete pilings. The new, four-lane highway, which includes shoulders for bicycle and pedestrian travel and traffic signals at major intersections, opened on June 27, 2016.

It is one of the largest employers in the Erie region. The complex features several large buildings, including a heart institute. History Hamot was founded as the Hamot Hospital Association on February 7, 1881. The hospital was named after Pierre Simon Vincent Hamot, a successful French businessman who had settled in Erie in the early 19th century and became an active member of the community. Following his death in 1846, his children and grandchildren donated the Hamot Homestead for use as a general hospital. Quickly organized and managed by the first nurse hired by the hospital, Irene Sutleff, the hospital opened its doors to the public on July 1, 1881, and treated its first patient who was admitted on July 10, 1881. The Hamot Homestead facility quickly outgrew its 25 patient capacity, and the first of many expansions was conducted in 1888. In 2009, Kane Community Hospital in Kane, Pennsylvania became a controlled affiliate of the Hamot Health Foundation, and therefore later became affiliated with UPMC through Hamot's integration with UPMC in 2011. UPMC Hamot also has clinical affiliations with Charles Cole Memorial Hospital, Elk Regional Health Center, and Warren General Hospital. On January 8, 2011, Hamot opened a five-story, $59 million Hamot Women's Hospital to house its obstetrics and gynecology services. Hamot's marketing campaigns have used a variety of themes, including \\"...it matters where you go\\", and \\"leading the way to better health\\". =Affiliation with UPMC= On August 27, 2010, Hamot Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) signed a letter of intent to negotiate a $300 million affiliation deal. On January 10, 2011, Hamot's board of trustees unanimously approved a formal agreement to affiliate and integrate into UPMC as the medical center's tertiary hub for northwestern Pennsylvania. Hamot's affiliation with UPMC official began on February 1, 2011 and the medical center was renamed \\"UPMC Hamot\\". In December 2015, UPMC Hamot Women's Hospital was renamed to Magee-Womens Hospital - UPMC Hamot Campus to reflect its alignment with Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC.

Designed to tie in with the Edinburgh Festival, on both occasions when competed for it consisted of a single match between Edinburgh's two professional clubs, Heart of Midlothian and Hibernian. Concept and format The idea for a football tournament during the Edinburgh Festival was first mooted in early 2003, with the intention being to organise a three team tournament during the duration of the Edinburgh Festival. Initial proposals suggested a club from one of the cities with which Edinburgh has twinning agreements would be invited to compete with Hearts and Hibernian in a triangular tournament. As Edinburgh's twin cities include Munich, Florence and Kiev, the local media speculated that a globally recognised team such as FC Bayern Munich, ACF Fiorentina or Dynamo Kiev may play in Scotland's capital. Eventually, though, organisers proved unable to attract a suitable foreign team and a single game format, comprising Hearts and Hibs, was agreed upon, with the clubs hosting the game in alternate years. The first event was scheduled for the Saturday before the start of the 2003-04 season. Tournaments \\\\---- Demise Despite initial enthusiasm for the competition, logistical problems soon led to doubts over its future. The failure to attract any non-Scottish opposition reduced it merely to the status of an extra Edinburgh derby. The prominence of the first game was not helped by the Scottish Premier League scheduling a league derby would occur just two weeks after the Festival Cup, with both matches played at Easter Road. The following year, pre-arranged friendlies and fixture congestion meant that the clubs found it difficult to find a suitable date within the Festival period. The international fixture weekend in early September was agreed upon, but this meant that both sides were missing players who were representing national teams, effectively reducing the game to little more than a reserve team fixture. Amongst the sides who played, Craig Sives and Calum Elliot had both yet to feature in the Hearts first team, while Hibs included untried personnel in the form of John Kane and Jay Shields. Further fixture congestion resulted in the clubs failing to reach agreement upon a suitable date in 2005, and there has been no attempt since then to revive the competition.

Sackler Center for Feminist Art opened on March 23, 2007 at the Brooklyn Museum as the first public space of its kind in the country; it is a nexus for feminist art, theory, and activism. The center, located on the museum's fourth floor, aims to create a compelling and interactive environment to raise awareness and educate future generations about feminism‚Äôs impact on culture. Since 2007 the Center has been the permanent home of Judy Chicago's landmark feminist work The Dinner Party. The Center's Forum is a venue for public programs and a platform of advocacy for women‚Äôs issues, and its Feminist Art and Herstory galleries present critically acclaimed exhibitions. The Council for Feminist Art, a membership group, supports the ongoing educational programming and the continuing success of the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. The Center's namesake and founder, Elizabeth A. Sackler, is a philanthropist and art collector. Layout The Dinner Partys gallery is the centerpiece of a dramatic design for the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art that was conceived and developed by award-winning architect Susan T. Rodriguez, FAIA, a partner in Ennead Architects. The Dinner Party, which includes 39 placesettings as well as the names of 999 women on a Heritage Floor, is enclosed in large, canting glass walls that provide a first glimpse of Chicago‚Äôs work. It is surrounded by a series of distinct, yet interconnected series of galleries that include two changing exhibition galleries and a study center that can be transformed from an academic forum into a multimedia gallery, as required, by a large pivoting wall.

The highway travels north from a short concurrency with SR 500 in Orchards through Battle Ground, the eastern terminus of SR 502, and communities in rural Clark County before crossing the Lewis River on the Yale Bridge. SR 503 intersects its spur route and turns west to parallel the Lewis River downstream to Woodland, where the highway ends at an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5). The highway was part of the Lewis River Road, signed as State Road 15, from 1909 until 1919. The current route of SR 503 was split between Secondary State Highway 1S (SSH 1) from Woodland to Battle Ground and SSH 1U from Battle Ground to Orchards in 1937, combined to form SR 503 during the 1964 highway renumbering. A spur route, established in 1991, travels northeast into the Gifford Pinchot National Forest along Yale Lake, serving the community of Cougar. Route description SR 503 crossing the Lewis River on the Yale Bridge between Clark and Cowlitz counties. SR 503 begins concurrent to SR 500 at an intersection with Fourth Plain Boulevard in Orchards. The two highways travel north on the four-lane 117th Avenue through Orchards until SR 500 turns east onto Padden Parkway, while SR 503 continues north into rural Clark County, passing Prairie High School. The roadway bypasses Brush Prairie on its west side and crosses the Chelatchie Prairie Railroad, before it turns northeast onto 122nd Avenue. SR 503 enters Battle Ground as 10th Avenue and intersects the eastern terminus of SR 502 west of Battle Ground High School. The highway crosses the East Fork Lewis River and leaves Battle Ground to pass Lewisville Park, listed on the National Register of Historic Places and located in Lewisville. SR 503 continues heading northeast into a heavily forested region of the Cascades foothills, toward Fargher Lake and Amboy. SR 503 turns east onto Fargher Lake Highway at Rock Creek and enters Amboy by following Chelatchie Creek towards Yale Lake. The highway travels north and crosses the Lewis River into Cowlitz County on the Yale Bridge. The one-lane warren truss bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is located downstream from the Yale Dam on Yale Lake and upstream of Lake Merwin. SR 503 continues into Cowlitz County and turns west onto Lewis River Road at an intersection with its spur route that heads east to Skamania County. The highway travels southwestward in the Lewis River valley and passes through the communities of Yale and Ariel. SR 503 enters Woodland and turns south onto Goerig Street before ending at a diamond interchange with I-5 near the confluence of the Lewis and Columbia rivers. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of the highway was the SR 500 concurrency in Orchards, serving 34,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section was at the western terminus of SR 503 Spur east of Yale, serving 720 vehicles. SR 503 between Orchards and Battle Ground is designated as part of the National Highway System, which includes roadways important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. History The spur route of SR 503, part of the original Lewis River Road in 1909, approaching its junction with the main highway near Yale SR 503 follows the route of State Road 15, established in 1909 as the Lewis River Road, traveling east from Woodland to the Skamania county line in Columbia National Forest. The Lewis River Road was removed from the state highway system in 1919 and transferred to Cowlitz County for maintenance. Clark and Cowlitz counties contracted the Portland Bridge and Iron Company to build a bridge over the Lewis River in 1917 and the bridge was opened to traffic in September 1920 at a cost of $15,000. After the completion of the Merwin Dam downstream in 1931 caused water levels on the Lewis River to rise, the two counties completed a one-lane warren truss bridge named the Yale Bridge over the Lewis River the following year to serve the remote communities of Yale and Yacolt. During the creation of the primary and secondary state highways in 1937, State Road 15 was added back to the state highway system as part of SSH 1S, which traveled from Primary State Highway 1 (PSH 1) and U.S. Route 99 (US 99) to SSH 1U in Battle Ground and turned west to end at PSH 1 and US 99 north of Mount Vista. PSH 1U, also established in 1937, traveled south from SSH 1S in Battle Ground to SSH 8A in Orchards. The Yale Bridge was maintained by Clark and Cowlitz counties until the 1940s and had its timber approach spans replaced with steel in 1958 under maintenance of the Department of Highways. SR 503 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering and codified in 1970 as the successor to SSH 1U and part of SSH 1S between Battle Ground and Woodland, while the remaining portion of SSH 1S between Mount Vista and Battle Ground became SR 502. The highway in the Lewis River valley, between Woodland and the Yale Bridge, was closed following the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens and re-opened after the Yale Bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in July 1982. The spur route of SR 503 was added to the state highway system in 1991 as part of the original Lewis River Road between Yale and the Skamania county line in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Between Orchards and Amboy, SR 503 was designated as the \\"Lewisville Highway\\", serving historic Lewisville Park. Spur route SR 503 Spur, known locally as the Lewis River Road, begins its route at an intersection with SR 503 east of Yale and north of the Yale Bridge. The highway travels northeast along Yale Lake through a forested region of Cowlitz County, passing Yale Park and the community of Cougar. SR 503 Spur turns east at Beaver Bay Park and ends shortly thereafter at Forest Route 90 on the Skamania County line south of Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument and Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The Lewis River Road was part of State Road 15 from 1909 until 1919 and was re-established in 1991 as a spur route of SR 503. WSDOT conducted a series of surveys to measure traffic volume in terms of AADT and calculated that 650 to 1,300 vehicles per day used the spur route in 2011.

Because of the build-up of adipocere in the bodies, a result of their being immersed in a cold flooded quarry, Littlejohn and Smith were able to provide important evidence in the trial, leading to the conviction and execution of Higgins. The two scientists' famous work gained notoriety 94 years later, when a relative of the boys asked for the return of specimens taken from their remains from the University of Edinburgh, for a proper burial. Research revealed that after their work on the case, Littlejohn and Smith had removed parts of the bodies from police custody to use as scientific specimens, as described in Smith's autobiography, according to Chris Paton in The Scotsman. In January 2008, the University agreed to return the remains, if the claimant could establish her relationship and the other relatives all agreed. In 1935, Smith was one of the forensic experts involved in the identification of the bodies of the victims of Buck Ruxton, using a novel technique of forensic anthropology to superimpose a photograph over the X-ray of a victim's skull. Also in 1935, while on holiday in Australia, he was called to give evidence in the infamous Shark Arm case. In 1937, Smith produced a profile of the Falkirk cat burglar, using a pair of shoes, predating the field of forensic podiatry.

Designed by Dub Architects, the building was completed in 1992. It was built to replace the former city hall after it had become outdated and expensive to operate. Design The building features two steel and glass pyramids, one (ground to peak), on top of a three-storey concrete structure. One pyramid provides natural light for the main atrium, the other for the council chambers. The building also features a clock Friendship Tower topped with a set of 23-carillon bells. Located on the eastern edge of the financial district in Edmonton's downtown, the building is the main feature on Sir Winston Churchill Square. In the winter, the fountain is converted to a skating rink. The design for the city hall met with some controversy when it was first announced. The original design called for the building to be topped with four cones. The cones were meant to pay tribute to the tipis that the First Nations once lived in on the site. The design met with negative feedback from the public as they felt it looked like dunce caps and nuclear reactors. Dub Architects then revised their design to replace the cones with the pyramids, with the pyramids designed to be evocative of the Rocky Mountains and the Muttart Conservatory.

Malakars are traditionally garlander by trade.  Origin  Malakars lived around Dhaka and other smaller towns of Bengal. The origin of the word Malakar came from Sanskrit. It is a Sandhi of mala and akar, which means a person who shapes mala, i.e a garlander. They are expert shola craftsmen. The Malakars are one of the nine artisan class that constituted the NavashƒÅkha and for generations they are involved in this craft. The nine trading castes that constitute Navashaka are Kumbhakar, Karmakar, Malakar, Kangsakar, Sankhakar, Swarnakar, Sutradhar, Chitrakar and Tantubaya.  Occupation  Malakars were employed to provide garlands and flowers for the village deities and also for the religious and social functions of the society. The profession of a Malakar required a considerable knowledge of flowers, for some were forbidden to be used in religious services and others could only be exhibited before the shrines of the deities to whom they belonged. But their principal occupation used to be Sholapith craft, one of the primordial handicrafts of both the Bengals. Sholapith craft of West Bengal was recognized as one of the best example of elegance, exquisite beauty and finest craftsmanship. Like many other traditional crafts, it has its origin in the ritual and religious requirements of old days. In ancient times these artisans held a respectable position in society and used to supply the Daker Saaj for the regional deities on occasions. Sholapith items formed an integral part of the major religious rituals in West Bengal. Fine examples of craftsmanship can be seen during the Durga Puja celebrations. At marriages their services are indispensable, for they prepare the crowns called topor worn by the bridal pair. No puja or marriage could be celebrated without the floral decoration for the deities or the topor made by the Malakar. Every community in each village, town and city needed an idol as fine as they could afford, so the craft flourished there.  Caste and religion/rituals  Malakars are mainly Vaishnava by creed, Shaivism and Saktism are also found among Malakars. Malakars who have their ancestral origin in Dhaka have a single gotra, Alamyan. During marriages, the bridal dress must be made up of red silk brought from Murshedabad. The bride is always carried in a palki or palanquin. The caste of Malakar is not well classified among the modern-day classifications. Traditionally they are Nabasakhas whose family rituals are performed by Kulin Bhramans. Even though in 1991, government of Indian classified many surnames including Malakars into the other backward classes, most of them still belong to the general caste of the modern day classification throughout West Bengal and Bangladesh.

William H. Taylor was born in Iowa on February 12, 1853 to a large mid-western family. In 1872 at the age of 19, his family moved to the Snoqualmie Valley where William took a cooks assistant job at the Newcastle Coal Mine cookhouse, near Issaquah. Later, he relocated to Fall City to help clear land and worked as logger near the mouth of the Skykomish River. Like most pioneers, he found work wherever he could and later returned to the upper Snoqualmie Valley to work as cabin builder, logger and general laborer for Lucinda Fares and her uncle Jeremiah Borst, known as the \\"Father of the Snoqualmie Valley\\". In 1876, he moved to California to take work as a miner. After receiving a work offer from Borst, he married Molly Beard and they returned north to work on Borst's farm for six years. They built their own home, a popular boarding house and trading post for travelers over the Snoqualmie Pass. As a family, they raised six children, but in the 1890s the Taylors separated. William later remarried valley resident Ella Hyman, who was a widow with one daughter. From 1888 to 1891, Taylor served as county commissioner and was instrumental in building many of the bridges over the rivers and streams that cut through the Snoqualmie Valley. On February 16, 1889, with the upcoming railroad boom, Taylor formally platted a town including his farm, upcoming street plans and building lots, giving it the name Snoqualmie. Later that summer competing Seattle land speculators subsequently platted nearby Snoqualmie Falls choosing a similar name. Pressured by demands of the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway to avoid confusion, Taylor reluctantly renamed his town Mountain View. However, the United States Post Office Department objected to Mountain View as a town already existed in northern Whatcom County. To conclude the matter Taylor agreed to permanently rename his settlement North Bend after its prime location near the large northward bend of the South Fork of the Snoqualmie River. Taylor was proud of his new, thriving town, but by historical accounts \\"He never got over having his town name taken away\\".http://www.historylink.org/File/305 Throughout his remaining years Taylor served on the Snoqualmie Valley school board, operated a general store, cleared an abundance of valley land and built many homes. He was also an early conservationist who planted trees to replace those he felled. In 1931, at the age of 76, he helped build a trail up Mount Si, which was dedicated as the William H. Taylor Memorial Trail by his friend the regional historian Edmund Meany. A hard-working man, he lived to the age of 88, long enough to see the settlement he founded grow into a vibrant community. Taylor died on January 9, 1941, and was buried at the foot of Mount Si.http://www.historylink.org/File/305 References Category:1853 births Category:1941 deaths Category:City founders Category:People from Iowa Category:People from North Bend, Washington ","title":"Will Taylor (land speculator)"},{"id":"10467572","text":"Ivan Petrovich Dombrovskyy (; born March 7, 1947 in Tsekhanivka, Odessa Oblast) is Ukrainian jurist, notary, electro-welder, and a judge of Constitutional Court of Ukraine and Supreme Court of Ukraine.

Douglass played college football at the University of Kentucky after transferring from Coffeyville Community College. Douglass played nine seasons with the Bears on special teams and as a nickel back. He then played two seasons with the Giants. In his early years, he was a witness in a federal trial involving illegal activities by a pair of sports agents. In high school, he had played for Trotwood-Madison High School and graduated in 1982. He returned to coach the team in 2001. In 2006, he led the team to the playoffs for the first time in 25 years. That year, he was accused of luring players from other teams and found guilty the following year, which was met with a brief suspension. Early life and amateur career Born in Muncie, Indiana, Douglass graduated from Trotwood-Madison High School in 1982 and then played defensive back for Kentucky. In 1984, he was a junior college transfer from Coffeyville Community College and earned the starting job for Kentucky after two games. He made an interception on his first play from scrimmage against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights team on October 6. Two weeks later he had an interception that set up a 36-yard field goal against LSU. He totalled three interceptions in his two-year career at Kentucky. On November 3, he recovered a fumble against . That season Kentucky got off to a 5-0 start, but they lost to all three ranked Southeastern Conference schools that they faced and finished the season 9-3\\\\. In September 1985, he suffered from a pinched nerve and was notable for having blown his defensive coverage on two plays in a 27-7 victory over Cincinnati Bearcats. The last of his interceptions occurred on November 16, 1985 against the Florida Gators when his 43-yard return set up Kentucky's touchdown that gave them a 13-12 lead. However, in the waning seconds as they clung to a 13-12 lead, his attempt at a second interception on an errant halfback option pass by future Bears teammate Neal Anderson slipped away and Florida was able to execute the winning field goal in their 15-13 victory. Douglass was selected to play for the Gray team in the 1985 Blue‚ÄìGray Football Classic. Playing career =Chicago Bears= With the last pick of the eighth round of the 1986 NFL Draft and 221st overall selection, the Bears drafted Douglass. He was the third of four defensive backs selected by the Bears in that draft (Vestee Jackson 2nd round, Bruce Jones 7th round, and Barton Hundley 10th round). The 1986 Bears signed Douglass in mid-July. In training camp, Douglas was switched from cornerback to safety and recovered a fumble in the first exhibition game against the Cowboys. He was described by bears scout Rod Graves as \\"built more like a fullback and could possibly help us inside as a strong-safety type\\". The Chicago Tribune listed him at and , and the Chicago Sun-Times reported him at and with the description that \\"Big, strong, tough hitter who likes to play. A little too slow to play cornerback. Makes some mistakes because of overeagerness.\\" Douglass was one of the final five players cut during training camp by the Bears at the beginning of September, but they re-signed him in late November when they put Jim McMahon on injured reserve. He did not play much in 1986, but was described as a favorite of coach Mike Ditka by the Chicago Sun-Times. Chicago Tribune writers noted that Ditka got a kick out of his big earring and fashion sense. In the 1987‚Äì88 NFL playoffs, although had only one previous start in his two-year career, he started for the Bears in place of five-year veteran Mike Richardson at left cornerback against the Redskins in their January 10, 1988 Divisional playoff game. The following season, when Shaun Gayle suffered a season-ending injury for the 1988 Bears, he took over the starting free safety assignment. In March 1989, he testified against sports agents Norby Walters of New York and Lloyd Bloom of California in United States District Court in Chicago in a trial about \\"inducing college athletes to sign professional contracts in violation of National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, and of threatening bodily harm\\". He told the jury that Bloom threatened that \\"somebody might break my legs\\" if he attempted to break his contract. In April, the agents were convicted of five counts of racketeering and fraud. In August 1989, he was one of thirteen athletes issued a four-game suspension for using steroids. Following the suspension, the Bears activated him in October. In September 1994, New York Jets fullback Richie Anderson dislocated an index finger punching Douglass in the head, while Douglass was wearing a football helmet, in reaction to what he believed was a late hit on teammate Adrian Murrell. Anderson was ejected from the game. In his nine seasons with the Bears, he earned a reputation as an excellent special teams player. =New York Giants= Prior to his time with the Giants, he worked as a male stripper. Following the 1994 NFL season, Douglass signed with the New York Giants in April. The two-year contract was estimated at $1.4 million. Douglass was impaired by a quadriceps injury in 1995 Giants training camp. The injury recurred during the season. He had performed well as the nickel back as a Giant. However, in October, he fractured his left fibula and was out for the rest of 1995 NFL season. Douglass appeared to be a likely roster cut during the 1996 Giants training camp final selection of its 53-man roster of players, but he made the final roster cut. In the second game of the 1996 NFL season, he made a fourth-and-one goalline stop against the Cowboys. Later that season, he scored his only career touchdown when he intercepted a Scott Mitchell pass and returned it 32 yards against the Detroit Lions on October 27. Late in the season he was affected by a hamstring injury. Douglass re-signed for the 1997 New York Giants season. Douglass was in competition with Sam Garnes and Rodney Young for the starting strong safety position for the 1997 NFL season. However, in training camp he was hampered by a deep thigh bruise. Despite the injury, he was projected as the starter. The injury caused him to miss an exhibition game. When he returned to practice he was soon also dealing with a sprained elbow. He lost the job to Garnes after missing a lot of exhibition time and allowing the latter to see plenty of action. In addition to the injury, Douglass had had a poor exhibition showing. Coaching career In 2001, he became the football coach at his alma mater Trotwood. He transformed the program by spending time creating player highlight reels, responding to college recruiters and taking his athletes on college tours. Subsequently, the athletes began getting college scholarship offers. In his first seven years nearly 100 of his players went on to play college football and over one-third at Division I programs. He is said to have a relaxed mentoring style of coaching and is known as Coach Doug. In 2007, the team made the playoffs for the first time since 1982. That year, he was charged with illegally recruiting athletes to play for his team. Upon review by the Ohio High School Athletic Association, he and his staff were found guilty of the charge. In 2008, he was placed on suspension for three weeks and his offensive coordinator resigned. The school was placed on two-year probation. In 2014, Douglass left Trotwood and became the head coach at Springfield High School. Before taking the position at Springfield, Douglass turned down an opportunity to coach defensive backs for Vanderbilt under new head coach Derek Mason.

Moreover, to prevent Northern warships from bringing their guns within range of the latter stronghold, they had sunk old hulks in narrow points of the channel and, ironically, had already carried out the mission of Union's stone bearing whalers. As a result, American and most of her consorts sailed for Port Royal on the 10th and 11th. There, Flag Officer DuPont decided that these ships could be put to good use as obstructions in the main channel in Charleston Harbor. They were moved to that port, and American was sunk in the main channel there on 20 December 1861.

It was part of former Sinanana Dinsho woreda what was separated for Dinsho and Sinana woredas and Robe Town. Part of the Bale Zone, Sinanana Dinsho was bordered on the south by the Mena River which separated it from Goba, on the west by Adaba, on the northwest by Agarfa, on the northeast by Gaserana Gololcha, on the east by Ginir, and on the southeast by Goro, Oromia. The administrative center of this woreda is Dinsho.  Overview  The altitude of the district varies from 2000 to 3600 meters above sea level, with higher elevation in the Dinsho subdistrict. Rivers include the Togona, Weyib and Shaya Rivers. A survey of the land in this woreda shows that 33.1% is arable or cultivable (29.8% was under annual crops), 30.4% pasture, 30.2% forest and other heavy vegetation, and the remaining 2.3% is considered swampy, mountainous or otherwise unusable. Sinanana Dinsho is one of the woredas in this Zone with abundant forests; the Bale Mountains National Park extends into the woreda.

Background and education The son of the Reverend John Pyle (died 1709), Rector of Stody, he was educated at Gresham's School, Holt, and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was admitted sizar on 17 May 1692, at the age of seventeen. He was elected a scholar of the College later the same year. He graduated BA in 1696 and MA in 1699. Career Pyle was ordained deacon on 30 May 1697 and priest on 25 September 1698, by Dr John Moore, bishop of Norwich, whose chaplain, William Whiston, commented that Pyle was one of the two best scholars he had ever examined. He was appointed vicar of Thorpe Market in 1698. In 1701, he was appointed minister of St Nicholas's Chapel in King's Lynn. He was lecturer and curate of St Margaret's, King's Lynn, from 1711, and Rector of Bexwell (1708‚Äì9), Outwell (1709‚Äì18), and Watlington (1710‚Äì26). Pyle was a strong Whig, and the accession of George I, together with the fact that King's Lynn was represented in parliament by the prime minister, Robert Walpole, gave Pyle hope of preferment in the church. His publications on the Bangorian controversy gained him the friendship of Benjamin Hoadly. After Hoadly became bishop of Salisbury, Pyle gained the living of Durnford, in Wiltshire. Pyle preached in London, and his Paraphrase of the Acts and Epistles, in the Manner of Dr Clarke (1725) and another volume of paraphrases gained the support of dissenters and latitudinarians such as Samuel Chandler, Samuel Clarke, and Thomas Herring. But Pyle never received additional preferment, even after Herring became Archbishop of Canterbury. Pyle made no secret of his views on the Trinity, in which he adopted an Arian position, revelling in what he called \\"the glorious prerogative of private judgement, the birth-right of Protestants\\". In 1732, he exchanged his old livings for the vicarage of St Margaret's, King's Lynn, which he retained until 1755, when he retired to Swaffham and died on 31 December 1756. Publications *On the Bangorian controversy, Pyle wrote A Vindication of the Bishop of Bangor, in Answer to the Exceptions of Mr Law (1718) and A Second Vindication (1718). He also published two tracts in reply to Henry Stebbing's on the matter. *A paraphrase with short and useful notes on the books of the Old Testament. : the third and fourth volumes.

Edmund (1702‚Äì1776) was lecturer at St Nicholas's, King's Lynn, archdeacon of York, chaplain to Bishop Benjamin Hoadly and chaplain to the King.

The census found the total population to be 286,730,819 inhabitants.This is the total \\"de facto\\" population (nalichnoye naseleniye ‚Äì –Ω–∞–ª–∏—á–Ω–æ–µ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ); the \\"permanent\\" population (postoyannoye naseleniye ‚Äì –ø–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ) was about 1 million persons fewer. Over time, the State Statistics Committee changed its method of reporting population totals in censuses. In the 1959 and 1970 censuses, it used the permanent population; in 1979 and 1989 it used the de facto or present population. See Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, \\"'Permanent' and 'Present' Populations in Soviet Statistics,\\" Soviet Studies, Vol. 37, pp. 386-402, July 1985. In 1989, the Soviet Union ranked as the third most populous in the world, above the United States (with 248,709,873 inhabitants according to the 1 April 1990 census), although it was well behind China and India. Statistics In 1989, about half of the Soviet Union's total population lived in Russia, and approximately one-sixth (18%) of them in Ukraine. Almost two-thirds (65.7%) of the population was urban, leaving the rural population with 34.3%.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Book of the Year 1991, Soviet Union, page 720. In this way, its gradual increase continued, as shown by the series represented by 47.9%, 56.3% and 62.3% of 1959, 1970 and 1979 respectively.United Nations: Demographic Yearbook, Historical supplement - Population by sex, residence, and intercensal rates of increase for total population, each census: 1948-1997, on the UN Statistics Division website (unstats.un.org ). The last two national censuses (held in 1979 and 1989) showed that the country had been experiencing an average annual increase of about 2.5 million people, although it was a slight decrease from a figure of around 3 million per year in the previous intercensal period, 1959‚Äì1970. This post-war increase had contributed to the USSR's partial demographic recovery from the significant population loss that the USSR had suffered during the Great Patriotic War (the Eastern Front of World War II), and before it, during Stalin's Great Purge of 1936‚Äì1938. The previous postwar censuses, conducted in 1959, 1970 and 1979, had enumerated 208,826,650, 241,720,134, and 262,436,227 inhabitants respectively. In 1990, the Soviet Union was more populated than both the United States and Canada together, having some 40 million more inhabitants than the U.S. alone. However, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991, the combined population of the 15 former Soviet republics stagnated at around 290 million inhabitants for the period 1995‚Äì2000. This significant slowdown may in part be due to the remarkable socio-economic changes that followed the disintegration of the USSR, that have tended to reduce even more the already decreasing birth rates (which were already showing some signs of decline since the Soviet era, in particular among the people living in the European part of the Soviet Union). The next census was possibly planned for 1999. Largest cities of the USSR according to the 1989 census.

He is described as an attractive Native American of the Quileute tribe in La Push, near Forks, Washington. In the second book of the series (New Moon), he discovers that he is a therianthrope who can shapeshift into a wolf. For the majority of the series, Jacob competes with Edward Cullen for Bella Swan's love. In the films Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn: Part 1, and Breaking Dawn: Part 2, Jacob is played by Taylor Lautner. Concept and creation According to Stephenie Meyer, Jacob was originally meant to be a device through which Bella could learn Edward's secret in Twilight. Meyer, her agent, and her editor all liked the character so much that they decided to give him a larger role in the following book, New Moon, with Meyer referring to the character as, \\"my favorite gift that New Moon gave to me.\\" > Jacob was my first experience with a character taking over‚Äîa minor character > developing such roundness and life that I couldn't keep him locked inside a > tiny role. ... From the very beginning, even when Jacob only appeared in > chapter six of Twilight, he was so alive. I liked him. More than I should > for such a small part.  Role in the books  =Twilight Saga= Jacob is given a small role in the first book of the series. He is introduced as the son of Billy Black, an old Swan family friend. When Bella uses him to get information on Edward Cullen and his family, Jacob tells her Quileute legends and introduces her to the idea that Edward is a vampire. Bella comes to like Jacob, and he develops a crush on her. =New Moon= In New Moon, Jacob's character is used as a device to help Bella emerge from her months-long depression, brought on by her distress over Edward's departure. The friendship between the two characters grows strong, but Jacob also develops romantic feelings for Bella that she does not reciprocate. It is revealed that, as a member of the Quileute tribe, Jacob is descended from an ancient line of \\"shapeshifters\\" that assume wolf form. In their backstory, the Quileutes and vampires are mortal enemies. When Jacob undergoes his first transformation into a wolf in front of Bella, it is in response to Paul, one of the wolf pack members who becomes enraged when he was slapped by Bella, causing him to phase and attempt to attack her. Jacob rushes outside to defend Bella, and he jumps high over her and phases in midair. Jacob rushes at Paul first and bites and pushes him. Jacob is shown in this scene to be very talented even when this was his first transformation at attacking and countering Paul as he is able to hit him before he has a chance to attack. A scene shows him tackling Paul causing him to crash into a boat rack. He and Paul later arrive at Emily Young's house and Paul apologizes to Bella. Soon, he becomes busy patrolling the forest with his pack, searching for vampires in the area. When Bella is caught by the vampire Laurent alone in a clearing, she is saved by Jacob and the wolf pack, who chase and kill Laurent. Sam first emerges from the woods, Laurent noticing more emerge runs away. Sam closes in on him but is struck back by Laurent just before he was about to tackle him. He later claims that Laurent was nothing but a simple kill. During the chase, Laurent is cornered by part of the pack while Jacob goes for the kill. Jacob and his friends are able to cover a range of 1.67 miles in just 1 minute meaning they are able to run at nearly or close to 100 mph at full run. Jacob serves as a rescue for Bella and a foil to Edward on multiple occasions in the narrative. When Bella, who has taken increasingly dangerous risks to feel closer to Edward, impulsively jumps off a cliff and almost drowns, Jacob rescues her. After Edward mistakenly believes she has died and plans to kill himself, Bella and Alice Cullen, rush to Italy to prevent his suicide, leaving Jacob heartbroken. Jacob is disgusted by Edward's return and by Bella's willingness to take Edward back after he left her. Jacob reminds Edward of his tribe's treaty with the Cullen family, which states that the Cullens are not allowed to bite humans. Bella interrupts and points out to Jacob that she wants to become a vampire, and it's her own decision. This angers Jacob, and he attempts to start a fight with Edward. Edward decides to leave with Bella, but Jacob grabs him and says: \\"You don't speak for her.\\" causing Edward to uppercut punch him into the air, causing him to transform. Edward and Jacob are stopped immediately by Bella as she says: \\"You can't harm each other without harming me.\\" Jacob, now feeling full of guilt and knowing that he would not harm her due to his still having a tremendous crush on her and her being his best and closest friend, decides to accept her wish, but he is feeling hurt by her decision which causes him to run away. =Eclipse= In Eclipse, Jacob, enraged that Bella plans to become a vampire, attempts to distance himself by not returning her phone calls and refusing to see her. Later, during the scene when Jacob visits Bella and Edward to discuss the vampire Victoria's return, he tells Bella that he misses her and wishes that they could remain friends. With Edward's approval, Bella begins to visit Jacob on a regular basis. On one of these visits, Jacob tells Bella that he is in love with her and that he wants her to choose him over Edward. Bella is caught off guard by his confession and tells him she only thinks of him as a friend. He forcibly kisses her, and she reacts by punching him in the face. This breaks her hand, though it does not affect Jacob because he is a werewolf and doesn't get hurt easily. This act later enrages Edward, and the two get into a heated argument in front of Bella's house. They come extremely close to a physical fight, until Bella pushes Edward away and pleads for them to stop. Edward, still fuming with rage, tells Jacob that if Bella gives him the word, he will harm him. Bella's father comes outside at that moment, and demands to know what's going on. Jacob admits that he kissed Bella, and she broke her hand punching him. Jacob apologizes and leaves. Later on, Jacob's shapeshifter wolf pack and the Cullen family join forces to defeat Victoria and the army of newborn vampires she has created. The wolf pack have agreed to meet at their house. They are in their wolf form as they don't trust the Cullen's enough to be in their human form as they possibly believe this to be a plot to destroy the pack. Carlisle greets them and tells how they should accurately and successfully attack a newborn. Sam telepathically asks what a newborn is and what the difference is between them and the newborn. He tells them that the newborns are a fresh breed of vampires that were humans forcibly turned with a combination of both human and vampire strength with most of their human element relying on intelligence. Carlisle tells them that they should never let a single one get their arms around them as they are strong enough to crush their bodies. He also says that they should never go for the \\"obvious\\" kill as they can get outnumbered easily and lose most of the pack. As the Cullen's demonstrate their tactics to the wolves on how they deal with newborns, Jacob also in his wolf form comes up to Bella. He nudges close to her as he still has a crush on her. She tells Jacob that if they join this attack many of them could get hurt or even killed. In response Jacob places his head in front of her and she pets him. Suddenly Edwards sees this and Jacob looks at him with a disgusted and annoyed look and walks off. The night before the battle, Edward and Jacob are alone with Bella on the top of a mountain. They are there, in a secluded spot, to protect her from Victoria and her blood-hungry army. It is night, and a blizzard beats at their tent. Bella is freezing to death, huddled in a blanket hold and shivering violently. Edward watches on with despair, as he can do nothing to help because his vampire skin is ice-cold. Jacob, being a werewolf, is never cold and has very a warm body. Because of his enhanced senses he can hear Bella's teeth chattering as he claims that he \\"can't sleep with all that teeth chattering going on.\\" He moves forward to lay down with Bella, knowing his body heat would keep her warm. Edward shoves him away, outraged, and says he will not go near her. Jacob demands that Edward lets him go. Bella, hardly conscious, pleads for them not to fight. Jacob insists that Bella needs his warmth, and reluctantly Edward lets him crawl into the blankets with her. She cuddles into his warmth, still hardly conscious. Bella stops shaking and chattering. She falls asleep in his arms. While she is sleeping, Edward and Jacob begin to talk quietly. As the night wears on, their private conversation softens and the two become closer. Right before the battle the next morning, Jacob overhears Edward and Bella discussing their engagement. He did not know about this, because Bella was trying to keep it a secret until the battle was over, for she knew he'd be reckless with his anger. Jacob is outraged, and refuses to believe that Bella truly loves Edward more than him. He threatens suicide by hoping he'd be killed in the battle. He is about to run off to join the soon-to-be-battle. Bella, in an attempt to stop him from getting killed, demands to be kissed by him. Jacob doesn't hesitate, and he kisses her passionately. Then, he leaves for the battle and Bella feels relieved to know that he no longer wants to be killed while fighting. After he is gone, she comes to the realization that she does love Jacob. In the battle, Jacob fights ferociously and savagely. He is in his wolf form as is the rest of the pack. He kills many vampires and together, with the Cullens, they defeat Victoria's newborn army. The battle is over, but one newborn vampire who had remained hidden the whole time, emerges from hiding. Leah, one of the wolves, immediately attacks. The enemy vampire wraps his arms around her neck and tries to strangle her, but Jacob lunges forward and knocks him off. They engage in a brief but vicious fight. Jacob falls and the vampire crushes his body with violent force. At once the vampire is pulled off by the other wolves and killed. Jacob is now back in human form. He is writhing on the ground naked and in extreme agony. Carlisle, the doctor vampire, announces that the bones in the right half of his body are crushed. The other wolves, now back in their human form too, stare in horror as Carlisle continues to inspect him. He tells the others that Jacob is healing from but at an extremely low rate and says that he needs to re-align Jacobs bones in order to speed up his healing. Leah is full of guilt and shame, and insists that she \\"had him\\" [the vampire]. Sam tells her to shut up. Sam suggested that they bring Jacob back to Billy's house so he start helping Jacob. Then, they haul Jacob off the ground and carry him off. At Jacob's house, Bella overhears Jacob screaming in pain as Carlisle re-aligns him. One of the pack tells Bella that Carlisle is doing this to speed up Jacobs healing. He is in bed with a high fever. Bella is worried and apologizes to him, wishing he'll get better soon. She also admits that it was a mistake to kiss him, and tries to tell him that even if she does love him, he has to accept that it is Edward who truly lies in her heart. Then she leaves, and Jacob his angered and deeply hurt. The epilogue is written from Jacob's point of view; angry and heartbroken at Bella's decision to become a vampire. He runs away in his wolf form to escape his pain. =Breaking Dawn= Jacob returns after an absence of several weeks to attend Bella and Edward's wedding in Breaking Dawn. Though described as being still visibly pained by her decision, he tells Bella that he wants her to be happy. Bella tells him that she and Edward plan to have a normal honeymoon before she becomes a vampire. Jacob becomes enraged, because he knows that Edward's vampire strength could kill her. Sam and the rest of the pack stop him before he phases into wolf form and gets into a fight with Edward. When Bella and Edward return from their honeymoon, Jacob becomes the narrator of the story for several chapters, during which he learns that she is pregnant with Edward's half-human, half-vampire baby and is extremely ill. When Jacob informs the pack of Bella's pregnancy, their leader Sam Uley plans an attack on the Cullens in order to kill Bella and her unborn child because of the threat he believes the child presents. Jacob, who feels that the Cullens are innocent, fights back against Sam and leaves the pack. Fulfilling his birthright as Alpha wolf, he is joined in a new pack by Seth and Leah Clearwater, who aid Jacob in protecting the Cullens. After the birth of Renesmee Carlie Cullen, Edward and Bella's daughter, Jacob \\"imprints\\" - an involuntary response in which a wolf finds his soulmate - on her. Afterward, Jacob is completely over Bella, and they remain close friends. The relationship between Jacob and the Cullens is also dispelled, and he and Edward come to view each other as friends after Jacob emotionally bonds with Renesmee. Characterization =Physical appearance= Wolf form: Jacob's wolf form is that of a large russet brown wolf. He has equivalent abilities to his brothers. He is shown to be very intelligent in both reasoning and coordinating others. He is the largest and strongest wolf in the pack. Human form: In the first film, Jacob has a very skinny physique that undergoes major physical changes by the second film. Being a werewolf, Jacob develops a massive physique. He is able to lift heavy objects that no human is capable of picking up. For example, a dirt bike he easily picked up from his father's truck. After becoming a wolf, he cuts off his long hair and gets the Quileute tattoo on his upper right arm. =Personality and abilities= Bella describes Jacob as a \\"happy person\\" who extends his happiness to the people around him. As Jacob's character emerges in New Moon, he is shown to be cheery, passionate, and adventurous, but hot-headed. Jacob is also able to shape-shift at will into a giant wolf, and sometimes when angered he will involuntarily phase. His body temperature is warmer than a human's body should be, reaching about , which allows him to withstand very cold weather. In human form, his body heals within seconds, he possesses superhuman strength and speed, has a high durability rate, sharp senses and free running abilities. In wolf form he can communicate with his wolf pack telepathically, has enhanced superhuman strength and speed and a substantial size increase. While in wolf form, his teeth can cut through the granite-hard bodies of a vampire with ease. Members of Quileute wolf-pack do age if they do not phase for a long time, which was pointed out when they were talking about the tribe's history, as long as they phase from every now and again they don't age with Jacob's body physically grown to the equivalent of a 25-year-old in Breaking Dawn but stopping after that. Jacob is the largest and strongest of the pack. Once they begin phasing, a Quileute shape-shifter may \\"imprint\\" - a method of finding one's soulmate - on someone, and will act as whatever that person wants or needs, whether it be an older brother, friend, protector, or lover. Jacob imprints on Edward and Bella's newborn daughter, Renesmee in Breaking Dawn. While treating Jacob in Eclipse, Carlisle takes a blood sample and runs some tests on it. He discovers that he has 24 pairs of chromosomes, one more than a human. A distinction is made in Breaking Dawn between the old world Children of the Moon (\\"true werewolves\\") and this shape-shifting Quileute tribe. The former are held to be a more ferocious and territorial type, with a transformative venomous bite and who involuntarily phase as do traditional werewolves on the full moon. The latter are implied as being blessed with the supernatural ability to shapeshift into other giant animals or \\"spirits of nature\\". Film portrayal Taylor Lautner Taylor Lautner played the part of Jacob Black in the film adaptation of Twilight. Due to major physical changes in the character of Jacob between Twilight and New Moon, director Chris Weitz considered replacing Lautner in the sequel with an actor who could more accurately portray \\"the new, larger Jacob Black.\\" In an attempt to keep the role, Lautner stated, \\"I have been working out. I've been working out since the day we finished filming Twilight. I just weighed myself today; I've put on 19 pounds ... [and] I'm guaranteeing Weitz 11 more [pounds] by filming.\\" Lautner would continue to play the role of Jacob in New Moon, and all the subsequent films. He also did his own stunts. Team Jacob Many fans of the Twilight franchise, particularly teenagers, have debated whether Edward or Jacob is the better match for Bella. Both sides of the debate have coalesced around informal \\"teams\\" of followers, whether \\"Team Jacob\\" or \\"Team Edward\\". In a poll done by Novel Novice Twilight and appearing on NNT News in 2008, Team Jacob got 2,641 votes and Team Edward got 5,130 votes. A poll done by Top 7 with over 43,000 votes had Jacob trailing Edward by around 3,000 votes.\\"Top Twilight Characters\\" . Top7. Retrieved February 6, 2013.

Differences were minor, a twin \\"push/pull\\" throttle cable for the E2 and different brake caliper stickers. The bike was manufactured in Japan, with parts also shipped to the US and assembled in Kawasaki's Nebraska plant for the US/Canada market to bypass the import tax levied on bikes over 700cc at the time by the US government, a protectionist move designed to save Harley-Davidson which was having financial problems at the time. Although carrying GPz badges on the engine covers, it was only referred to by Kawasaki as the \\"750 Turbo\\"‚Äî‚Äîthe GPz tag was not mentioned. It is also referred to as the ZX750E. Development started in January 1981 as a turbocharged 650, then as a 750 from November 1981. When finally released, the stock bike made a claimed , had sports bike handling (for the day) and looked good - especially next to the other factory turbo bikes which were already on the market such as the Suzuki XN85, Honda CX500 and CX650 turbos, and the Yamaha Seca Turbo. Performance was on a par with the GPz1100, at around 11.2 seconds at for the quarter mile and flat out. One magazine even branded it the fastest bike they had ever tested, and Kawasaki ran some ads claiming it to be \\"The Fastest Production Motorcycle in the World\\". Jay \\"PeeWee\\" Gleason also recorded a 10.71 second quarter mile for Kawasaki to show that the turbo had genuine performance and was ahead of the other factory turbos. It is widely considered to be the \\"best\\" factory turbo produced by the Japanese manufacturers. To build the turbo, Kawasaki did not simply add fuel injection and a turbocharger to a standard GPz750 motorcycle engine. Some parts are exclusive to the \\"turbo\\", such as low-compression (7.8:1) pistons, stronger gearbox internals, a modified oil pan with an extra oil scavenge pump, a boost indicator, the characteristic aluminium \\"turbo\\"-spoiler, and a different Unitrak linkage (which gave it a firmer ride). The exhaust system and turbo (except silencers) were strengthened with different tube material, and some dimensions and frame geometry differed (28¬∞ rake instead of 26¬∞). The rest came from conventionally aspirated 750 and the 1100 (front fork, brakes and some injection parts) and the entire cylinder head assembly from the KZ 650. The GPz Turbo used a Hitachi HT-10B turbocharger, positioned close to the headers, and electronic fuel injection.

Since 2011 it is known as Christian School and Chapel for the Deaf (CSC) History The Evangelical School for the Deaf is a private Christian school for deaf children founded by missionaries in 1959. The school was originally known as Evangelical Mission to the Deaf and for a time was under the mission board United Mission Fellowship. In 1971, the ministry settled on the current name. ESD is under the administration of the World Mission to the Deaf, a Canadian organization that channels resources to the school and provides counsel. In 2011, the school was reincorporated as Christian School and Chapel for the Deaf, Inc. as the board and staff began to envision more outreach and an enlarged vision to include adult ministries. ESD opened its doors to a class of five students (three boys, two girls) in September 1960. School directors School directors at ESD have traditionally assumed a multi-faceted role. In addition to administrative and supervisory duties, directors have often taught academic and technical classes, ran ministries outside of the school, taught religious classes at local churches, and even served as pastors. * Gene Orcutt served as the school director from 1959 until the 1970s. * Roger Rawlings served as school director from 1970 to 1989. While serving at ESD, Roger and his wife Pamela continued a church for the deaf in San Juan. In 1985, the church bought a building in Hato Rey and began the Evangelical Church and Center for the Deaf. * Pam Mobray served until 1998. * Elisabeth Hoke began working at ESD in 1984 after graduating from Penn State University with a B.S. in deaf education. In 1989, Hoke returned to college and graduated with a M.S. in deaf education from Western Maryland College in 1991. She took over the position in 1998 and is now working as an administrator and as a teacher. Educational philosophy The Evangelical School for the Deaf uses the Total Communication (TC) approach to provide academic instruction. Under this philosophy, teachers use whatever means of communication is most readily understood by the student to provide him/her with an appropriate and stimulating level of academic instruction. Sign language at ESD The kind of sign language used at the school varies due to the diverse population of students and staff. The types of sign language includes the following: American Sign Language (ASL), Puerto Rican Sign Language (PRSL), signed English, and pidgin signed English (PSE), known as contact signing. This is not a definitive list as research in the field of sign language linguistics is constantly making new discoveries and these categories of language frequently overlap. Handbell choir Since 2002, the Evangelical School for the Deaf bell choir has been performing in venues around Puerto Rico. Initially conceived and directed by Marisol Matos, the bell choir has grown in popularity and skill. The students are directed using sign language instead of audible cues and rely on sheet music to know when to play their parts. The handbell choir has performed at the Puerto Rican Senate and many local churches and universities. The school director, Elisabeth Hoke, directs the choir.

(MISO)url=https://www.misoenergy.org/AboutUs/MediaCenter/pages/MediaCenter.aspxformat=https accessdate =2013-07-03 is an Independent System Operator (ISO) and Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) providing open-access transmission service and monitoring the high-voltage transmission system in the Midwest United States and Manitoba, Canada and a southern United States region which includes much of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. MISO also operates one of the world's largest real-time energy markets. Definition of ISOs and RTOs Both ISOs and RTOs are organizations formed with the approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to coordinate, control and monitor the use of the electric transmission system by utilities, generators and marketers. An ISO is a non-profit organization that combines the transmission facilities of several transmission owners into a single transmission system to move energy over long distances at a single lower price than the combined charges of each utility that may be located between the buyer and seller. The ISO provides non- discriminatory service and must be independent of the transmission owners and the customers who use its system. RTOs also provide non-discriminatory access to the transmission network; however, they are required to meet specific FERC regulations that deal with transmission planning and expansion for an entire region, the use of energy markets to deal with system congestion, of power users and owners. RTOs offer regional wholesale electric transmission services under one tariff. FERC first required transmission owners to provide non- discriminatory access to their lines in Order Nos. 888 and 889, building on the model it had used to require interstate natural gas pipelines to provide access to pipeline capacity. In those orders, FERC noted that ISOs could provide the additional assurance of independence from the owners, and the elimination of multiple (\\"pancaked\\") rates to transmit electricity over long distances. Shortly thereafter, FERC Order No. 2000 encouraged the formation of RTO's to regionally manage portions of North America's electricity grid. There are nine ISOs, five of which are RTOs, operating in North America. They manage the systems that serve two-thirds of the customers in the U.S., and over half the population of Canada. Over time, the distinction between ISOs and RTOs in the United States has become insignificant. Both organizations provide similar transmission services under a single tariff at a single rate, and they operate energy markets within their footprints. =Incorporation under FERC= MISO was established in 1998 as an ISO and was approved as the nation's first RTO by FERC in 2001. The organization is headquartered in Carmel, Indiana with operation control centers in Carmel and Eagan, Minnesota and Little Rock, Arkansas. =Footprint/membership= MISO is an independent and member-based non-profit organization. Its members include 51 transmission owners with more than 65,800 miles of transmission lines. Members include investor-owned utilities, public power utilities, and cooperatives, such as: Entergy, Indianapolis Power & Light, International Transmission Company, Great River Energy, Xcel Energy, and City Water Light and Power. =History= MISO began its operation on \\"Day 1,\\" a development phase between 1998 and 2005. Throughout this period the company initiated and built up transmission services to increase grid reliability. MISO was established as an ISO in 1998 after voluntary discussions led to its formation. One year later, the first board of directors was elected and by the end of 2000, the organization had more than 70 employees. In 2001, FERC approved MISO as the nation's first RTO. Northeast blackout of 2003 The following is the blackout's sequence of events on August 14, 2003 (times in EDT): 12:15 p.m. Incorrect telemetry data renders inoperative the state estimator, a power flow monitoring tool operated by the Indiana-based Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO). An operator corrects the telemetry problem and forgets to restart the monitoring tool. In 2005 MISO announced the opening of the MISO Energy Markets. The new services ushered in MISO's \\"Day 2\\" development phase, providing a wholesale electricity market that settles $2 billion in transactions each month. During this period, MISO grew its employee base to more than 600 staff, and moved the corporate headquarters and operations center under one roof in Carmel, Indiana. Now, in addition to Day-Ahead and Real-Time markets, MISO operates an ancillary services market which began on January 6, 2009. This market provides both energy and operating reserves as well as regulation and response services that support reliable transmission service. Name was changed in April 2013. Value Proposition The Value Proposition is a study demonstrating MISO's major benefits as an RTO provider for the heartland region. MISO participants see $700 million to $900 million in annual benefits due to improvements in reliability, efficiency, and development: *Reliability ‚Äì MISO monitors the state of the grid every 30 seconds. This allows the organization to detect potential issues and identify effective responses within minutes. Its reliability function also maintains seamless management between neighboring ISO and RTO providers and ensures that all government regulations are met. *Efficiency ‚Äì MISO maximizes the efficient use of the transmission system and energy under fluctuating power demands. The Security Constrained Economic Dispatch software matches energy needs with resources in terms of capability and price. *Development ‚Äì Regional planning efforts have resulted in almost $8.4 billion in new infrastructure and improvements to the transmission system. The development of the transmission system supports the reliable operation of the interconnected grid and maintains a competitive energy market. Workforce MISO is governed by an independent nine-member Board of Directors, with eight independent directors elected by the membership, plus the president of MISO. No board member may have been a director, officer or employee of a member, user, or affiliate of a member or user for two years before or after the election to the Board. Under MISO's Standards of Conduct, all MISO board members, employees, and their immediate family members are required to divest themselves of any financial holdings in member or user companies. MISO employs a staff of approximately 900 full-time employees between its three operation control centers and its transmission planning office in Metairie, LA. Technology MISO uses a computer model called a State Estimator that analyzes real-time conditions of the MISO power grid. The system has been in operation since December 31, 2003, and serves as the primary management tool for the reliability of transmission facilities throughout the organization's footprint. The State Estimator is one of the world's largest computer systems and provides 303,800 data points that are updated every 5 seconds. Operations As the primary RTO in the Midwest and South United States, MISO carries out operational responsibilities to maintain the flow of energy. =Grid management and reliability= Data is evaluated by Reliability Coordinators and Reliability Analysts, monitoring the grid 24/7. Projecting the movement of power in real-time, MISO's control room staff monitors and manages activity on the electric transmission system. =Infrastructure planning and energy alternatives= MISO performs regional planning in accordance with FERC principles. MISO infrastructure planning has four primary objectives: * provide an efficient and reliable transmission system * access a diverse number of energy resources, including renewable energies * expand energy trading opportunities * meet state and federal energy policy objectives =MISO Markets= This open market began on April 1, 2005, and provides financially binding day-ahead and real-time pricing of energy. MISO Markets include a Financial Transmission Rights Market, a Day-Ahead Market, a Real-Time Market, and a market for operating reserves and regulation. They are operated and settled separately, providing a clear look at day-to-day price changes., Planning efforts =MISO Transmission Expansion Plan (MTEP)= MTEP is a long-term annual planning study that identifies and supports the development of transmission infrastructure that is sufficiently robust to meet local and regional reliability standards and enables competition among wholesale energy suppliers. The MISO Board of Directors reviews the MTEP annually during its December meeting. MTEP includes recommendations for transmission infrastructure additions and electric grid improvements throughout the MISO footprint. Since its inception in 2003, MTEP plans have recommended almost $6.9 billion in transmission projects, totaling $2.2 billion already in operation. Page text.MISO Transmission Expansion Plan =MISO ‚Äì PJM Interconnection Joint and Common Market (JCM)= In cooperation with PJM Interconnection (PJM), the two organizations developed a Joint and Common Market (JCM) to align market rules between them and to reduce the operating impact of the many transmission interconnections between the two RTOs. In December 2003, the two RTOs filed a Joint Operating Agreement with FERC, detailing how the organizations will share information and phase in their respective operations.

He was killed in an air accident following the war. Early life Pierre Marinovitch was born in Paris on 1 August 1898, to Velizar and Agripina Marinoviƒá (n√©e Bronkov). His father was a Serb and his mother was Polish. Marinovitch's paternal grandfather, Jovan Marinoviƒá, served as Prime Minister of Serbia between 1873 and 1874, and was Serbian ambassador to France from 1879 to 1889. His great-grandfather was wealthy Serbian merchant Mi≈°a Anastasijeviƒá. Marinovitch attended school in France and Ireland, and was fluent in English. He went by the nickname \\"Marino\\". World War I Seventeen-year-old Marinovitch enlisted in 27e R√©giment de Dragoons on 12 February 1916. On 16 July, he transferred to aviation as a student pilot, and received Military Pilots Brevet N.4910 on 15 November 1916. Marinovitch received his graduate diploma on 19 March 1917, and was assigned to Escadrille No. 38. He became seriously ill shortly afterwards, and had to spend two months in a French military hospital. Upon being released from hospital, he was assigned to Escadrille No. 94, which was being formed near Ch√¢lons-en- Champagne. The unit earned the nickname \\"The Reapers\\" and adopted the Grim Reaper as their logo. Marinovitch was promoted to the rank of Mar√©chal-des- logis on 26 July 1917. On 10 January 1918, he was awarded the M√©daille militaire (Order N.6239) in recognition of his third aerial victory. Marinovitch claimed his first four kills flying Nieuport 24s. On 30 January, Escadrille No. 94 was relocated to Villeneuve-les-Vertus and incorporated into Groupe de Chasse XVIII under Captain Jacques Sabattier de Vignolle. Marinovitch was promoted to adjutant on 20 February 1918. On 26 March, he attacked a German two-seater above Caurel, and watched as it spiraled towards the ground exuding smoke before he disengaged at a height of . This was initially listed as a \\"probable kill\\", and was not confirmed until after the war. On 15 May, Marinovitch downed a German reconnaissance plane over Essertaux. Its crew was later taken prisoner. Four days later, Marinovitch shot down a Rumpler just south of Moreuil. By this point, the French press began referring to him as \\"The Youngest Ace\\" (Benjamin des As), because of his youth. On 31 May, Marinovitch shot down a two-seater near Villers-Cotter√™ts. The pilot, unteroffizier Hippolyt Kaminski, was killed, and his observer was captured. A few minutes later, Marinovitch downed a Fokker Dr.I. On 5 June, Marinovitch and Andr√©-Henri Martenot de Cordou teamed up to destroy a German two-seater over Parcy-et-Tigny on 5 June. On 1 July, Marinovitch downed another Rumpler near Monnes. Two weeks later, Marinovitch participated in the destruction of two German planes. On 22 July, he destroyed another Rumpler. He was made Ch√©valier de la L√©gion d'honneur on 11 August 1918. On 17 August, he shot down a Rumpler and a Fokker D.VII. Marinovitch was promoted to second lieutenant on 20 October, and awarded the Croix de guerre. He was credited with 21 aerial victories during the war. Death Marinovitch survived the war, and continued to fly. He was killed in a flying accident in Brussels on 2 October 1919.

After arriving, she is invited to a party by a guy, Scott Baker (Mark-Paul Gosselaar), with her roommates Jordan McCann (Jenna Von Oy) and Kellie Salter (Nikki Cox), and attracts the attention of Scott, the member of the college's most popular fraternity (to which her brother, Michael Connell (Brandon Douglas), also belongs) who has a history of date-raping fellow female students. She and Jordan attend a party at Scott's frat; there, she becomes the latest victim of Scott, who drugs her. Before he takes her upstairs to a room to rape her, she notices a passed-out Jordan being taken to a room by a guy as well. Upstairs, Scott turns on loud music, and then rapes her. Melissa manages to escape his room afterwards and flees from the frat house in tears. The next day, an upset Melissa returns to college and bumps several times into Scott, who pretends as if nothing has happened. Melissa becomes depressed, ignoring her school work, estranging from her friends, not eating and not sleeping. Jordan takes it worse and drops out of college immediately. One night, while having dinner with Michael and his girlfriend Holly Essex (Hillary Danner), Scott shows up. Melissa freaks out, runs away and causes a car accident. She is taken into the hospital, but is not severely injured. She admits to a doctor about what happened, and she realizes she had been raped. She later admits this to her mother Denise Connell (Bess Armstrong), who wants to press charges. Michael and her father Edward (Lawrence Pressman) discourage her from doing this, explaining it could ruin her future. Prosecuting Scott proves to be difficult, because she does not have any evidence. She receives no support from her friends and fellow students either, who think she led him on and was asking for it. When Scott starts to threaten her and students start bullying her, she considers pulling back from prosecuting. However, fed up with being scared, she decides not to give up, but Scott manipulates the jury and is found not guilty. Devastated by the results, Melissa attempts to move on with her life, wanting to put the rape behind her. Michael, however, is determined to help her and finds photos taken the night of the party (as she is fleeing from the room) proving Melissa was right all along. He gets into a fight with Scott for raping his sister and announces he is leaving the fraternity. Meanwhile, Melissa starts receiving support from other students. Courtney (Jennifer Greenhut), a promiscuous girl, admits to her that she was raped by Scott as well but did not have the courage to say something. At Michael's going away party, Scott and the rest of his fraternity brothers force him to drink excessively (possibly as retribution for sticking up for Melissa), causing him to severely black out and be hospitalized, though he survives. This inspires Melissa to fight back so she starts to collect evidence against Scott and is successful in gaining much video footage, that was taken the night of the party and various other times in the frat house that shows his true nature, from Leland (Kristoffer Ryan Winters) (Michael's best friend, the frat camera man, who is also considering leaving the fraternity after Michael's hospitalization). She gives Scott one chance to come clean, and when he does not take it, she publicizes the footage by airing it on TV, showing what kind of person he truly is. Afterwards, Scott becomes alienated, Kellie apologizes to Melissa for not being there for her, and Jordan finally shares her rape story with Melissa before telling her that she plans to reapply for the next semester. As the film ends, Scott's fraternity house is being shut down, apparently, the fraternity's charter having been revoked for the consumption of alcohol on their premises.

Wong is also an active member of the Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women. Biography Wong was born in Oakland, California to Chinese immigrants. Her father had immigrated to Oakland in 1912. Wong is a Chinese American poet, feminist, and socialist who has organized and participated in activist groups working to create better conditions for women, workers, and minorities.Madsen, Deborah L. (2005). Asian American writers. Detroit: Thomson Gale. p. 318. During World War II, the Wong family worked in a grocery store in Berkeley. The internment of her Japanese American neighbors left a profound impact on her intellectual development, sensitizing her to issues of racism and the concerns of Asian Americans. The family borrowed $2,000 to start a restaurant, The Great China, in Oakland's Chinatown, where Wong worked as a waitress during her youth.Memorymap.oacc.cc She attended public school, graduating from Oakland High School, and started bull work as a secretary for the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, a position she held until 1982. She later served as senior analyst in affirmative action at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). While in her mid-30s, Wong began studying creative writing at San Francisco State University (SFSU) and began to write and publish her poetry. Wong credits her feminist classmates at SFSU with encouraging her writing. A male professor had once told her to throw away an angry poem she had written. One classmate told her, \\"You don't have to listen to him!\\" While a student at San Francisco State University, Wong was involved with the campus Women Writers Union, which organized around issues of race, sex, and class. In the late 1970s, alongside lesbian activist and writer Merle Woo, Wong organized the feminist literary and performance group Unbound Feet. The group performed at colleges, universities, and community centers. During this time she encountered members of two affiliated socialist feminist organizations, Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party, and within a few years had joined their ranks. In 1983, Wong traveled to China on the first U.S. Women Writers Tour to China sponsored by the US‚ÄìChina Peoples Friendship Association with Tillie Olsen, Alice Walker, Paule Marshall. Also in 1983 she was a major organizer of the Merle Woo Defense Committee. Woo, a lesbian Korean-Chinese American feminist, had filed a complaint against their former employer alleging wrongful termination based on discrimination. Working with other Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women members, Wong raised funds and awareness of the case. Two legal cases were won against the defendant. From 1983 to 1985 Wong taught poetry writing at Mills College in Oakland and playwriting at the Asian American Theater Company in San Francisco.Madsen, Deborah L. (2005). Asian American writers. Detroit: Thomson Gale. p. 318. . During the 1980s and 1990s, Wong was keynote speaker at many national and regional conferences, including Third World Women and Feminist Perspectives, Women Against Racism, and the National Women's Studies Association. She has recited her poetry in China, Cuba, and throughout the U.S. She has also participated on panels concerning labor, Asian American literature, and poetry. Furthermore, Wong has taught Women's studies at the University of Minnesota and poetry writing at Mills College in Oakland, California. Excerpts from two her poems have been permanently installed as plaques at public sites at the San Francisco Municipal Railway. She has received awards from the Women's Foundation (San Francisco), University of California, Santa Barbara's Asian American Faculty and Staff Association, and the San Francisco-based Kearny Street Workshop, a multidisciplinary art collective. She served many years as the Bay Area organizer of the Freedom Socialist Party, and is still active with the party, Radical Women, and Bay Area United Against War. She currently resides in San Francisco. Work Wong's first collection of poetry, Dreams in Harrison Railroad Park (1977), was published by Kelsey Street Press. This book went through four printings and was the most successful release in the history of Kelsey Street Press. Her other titles are The Death of Long Steam Lady (1986), published by West End Press and Stolen Moments (1997). Her work has appeared in approximately 200 anthologies and publications.\\"Nellie Wong.\\" Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale, 2007. Biography in Context. Web. 17 Jan. 2016. Wong writes directly from her working life; she states \\"A lot of my poems come from the workplace; that's where I've experienced a great deal of sexism and racism.\\" Other themes include her family history and Asian American identity, about which she has said, \\"I care about the roots of Asian American culture and how and why they came here [...] It's something every Asian family has experienced.\\" Her poetry spans issues of feminism, the fight against racism, workplace injustice, and finding identity as a writer and activist. In 1981, Wong participated with Mitsuye Yamada in the documentary film Mitsuye & Nellie, Asian American Poets, produced by Allie Light and Irving Saraf. The film recounts the experiences and hardships that affected the writers and their families. Significant to the film's focus is how World War II and the bombing of Pearl Harbor encouraged divisive perceptions of Japanese as \\"bad\\" Asians, while the Chinese were seen as \\"good\\" Asians. \\"Can't Tell,\\" one of the poems Wong recites in the film, highlights the author's attempt to understand why her Japanese neighbors were being sent to internment camps when she and her family, as Chinese Americans, were considered patriotic citizens. The film also shows lively exchanges between Wong and her siblings, highlighting the feistiness of her older sister, Li Keng, also an author, and her youngest sister, Flo Oy Wong, an installation artist. Her brother, William Wong, is a journalist and the author of Yellow Journalist: Dispatches from Asian America. Her papers are housed at the California Ethnic and Multicultural Archives.

They grow up to 70 cm. Shortjaw bonefish are important to food security throughout the coastal Pacific where they are native as Pacific island communities depend on this fish for food. However, the species has become depleted throughout much of its range. Recreational angling for shortjaw bonefish is popular in Hawaii, Cook Islands, Christmas Island, and French Polynesia. Anglers must be cautious when angling in some Pacific destinations because of the high rates of post-release predation that released bonefish can experience by sharks. Reef sharks on sandy flats are highly capable predators that can detect injured or stressed bonefish and research has shown that high numbers of bonefish can be eaten very soon after release. When angling, bonefish should be brought in quickly with extremely limited handling. Faster release yields better outcomes for bonefish that are captured by anglers. Flats with high densities of sharks should be scrutinized by anglers before fishing.

From the final stages of their training and farewells at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, through their deployment to Baghdad, Samarra and Tikrit, and then the return home to their loved ones, this is a searching examination of the combat, the life and death struggles, and the profound changes in the lives of these professional soldiers who set out with hope and confidence of making a difference in Iraq. Access The British/American filmmakers were given unprecedented access to the soldiers for fourteen months: from September 2005, to November 2006, and accompanied them into the most dangerous places. The result is a feature film that attempts to examine the Iraq War with ruthless scrutiny, with honesty and fairness, and reveals courage of an uncommon kind. Before they leave Fort Campbell, hundreds of soldiers shout ‚ÄúHoo-ah‚Äù in response to their brigade commander's dramatic war speech in which he tells them to \\"look like a killer\\" at all times in Iraq. The film begins by demonstrating the lethal force of America‚Äôs best-trained soldiers. But that is not how the rest of the story unfolds. The soldiers of Charlie Troop find it increasingly difficult to carry out their mission in a hostile environment, full of deception and danger. A carefully planned attempt to destroy a team of insurgents who are firing rockets and mortars at them, the troops are sabotaged by the over-protective actions of a parent unit from the Third Infantry Division. Despite vigilant surveillance work, superior weapons and training, and all the energy of their warrior natures, the soldiers are thrown into the most frustrating mission conceivable. This is a film about young men and their commanders who prepare in earnest for their duty, who understand what they are meant to do in Iraq, and how - through their experiences in Samarra, Baghdad and Tikrit - dramatic changes take place in their perspectives. It is about soldiers who fight for their lives when their humvee is destroyed by insurgents. It is about a specialist who shoots up a car full of people who later turn out to be civilians. It is about mothers and young wives, gathered at a military funeral for the soldiers killed in action in Iraq, mourning their lost sons and husbands. This is their story, narrated by the soldiers and their families. It provides the most revealing, in-depth look inside the U.S. Army at war ever produced on film. Between them, Laurence, Green and Thompson have covered more than thirty wars since Vietnam in 1965, and have won every major award in broadcast journalism in the United States.

According to some scholars he converted to Christianity and died in a St. Petersburg asylum. Chabad sources claim that his conversion and related documents were faked by the Church. Life The year of Moshe Schneersohn's birth is not clear. It is known that he married in 1797, and since all of his brothers married at 14 years of age, scholars assume that he was born around 1784. The sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe in his historical notes on the Chabad movement notes that he was born in 1784 in Liozna, but elsewhere writes that he was born in 1779. It is alleged that when he was eight years old he started showing signs of mental infirmity. He received medical treatment, and from the scant information available, it appears that his illness alternated between remission and outbreak during his childhood. In 1801 his father took him for treatment with doctors in Vitebsk, St. Petersburg and Smolensk. He married Shifra daughter of Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh of Ule, a town near Liadi. He went to live with his father-in-law in Ule and was soon appointed to the post of Rabbi in that town. Moshe had an excellent memory, and while in Ule he authored a number of manuscripts of novellas that he had heard from his father (as well as notations). These are still used by Chabad Hasidim today. During Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, his family fled from Liadi to the Russian interior. His father died as a result of the journey. Moshe did not go with them, instead traveling to Shklov. He was captured by the French Army and sentenced to death for espionage, but he was pardoned. According to a letter written by his mother in 1817, he had been stable prior to this incident, but apparently this event took a toll on his mental health. Alleged conversion Chabad accounts and scholarly accounts of Moshe's conversion and later life differ. The Chabad biography, authored by the sixth Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, recounts that Moshe accompanied his brother, the second Rebbe of Chabad, Dovber Schneuri to the Tsar to discuss the situation of the Jews in his territory. The Tsar was impressed by Moshe's erudition, and ordered a disputation between Moshe and his Chief Priest. Moshe reluctantly accepted the challenge, and won the debate. Furious, the Christians arrested Moshe, took him to a church and physically forced him to sign his name to a letter that declared his intent to convert to Christianity. Moshe managed to escape from the church, but due to fear of rearrest, he traveled around Europe incognito until his death in 1878. The documentation of his conversion post date this incident by several years. Contemporary Chabad sources repeat the story of the attempted forced conversion.Chabad: Documents are fakes His conversion and mental infirmity and apostasy have been denied by the Chabad movement consistently since his death, with no historical backing whatsoever.New Book Reveals Darker Chapters In Hasidic History, Allan Nadler, August 25 2006, (Review of Assaf's book in The Forward) Documents found by historian Shaul Stampfer apparently document Schneersohn's conversion to Christianity. The original documents are located in the National Historical Archives in Minsk, Belarus. These include a letter to the local priest in which he states his intent to convert and his baptismal certificate dated July 4, 1820. The documents also show that after his conversion he worked for the Tsar to assist in the conversion of other Jews.It's official: Son of Chabad movement's founder converted to Catholicism In the letter in which he stated his intention to convert he wrote that Jews who knew him had tried to prevent him from doing so by watching him constantly, beating him and threatening him. He wrote: \\"I have remained steadfast in my desire to take upon myself the true faith of Jesus Christ, to which the holy books and all the prophets testify.\\" After conversion he changed his name to Leon Yulievitch. He returned to visit Lubavitch, but fled, ultimately dying in a mental institution in St. Petersburg.

American imperialism was a serious problem in the formation of Arab cinema in general and cinema of Kuwait in particular. This act caused the absence of the real personality and character of a Kuwaiti culture and history. However, Kuwaitis tried to preserve their national identity by producing and broadcasting local content in their television channels. Which was a balance between protecting and preserving their national identity while also satisfying other preferences. The domination of American films and other foreign produced films has the Kuwaiti cinema imitate and depend on it for so long. It was in 1971 that the young talent of Khalid Alsidiqq that emerged and directed the first Kuwaiti feature film that talks about its cultural heritage and history. Although Kuwait is a country that depends heavily on importing movies, they did not abandon their culture and tradition. Sensitive topics, phrases and scenes are removed. If the movie contains an abundance of these type of offensive or obscene content they rather cancel the whole movie from the cinemas. In 1972, Kuwait produced their first feature film Bas ya Bahr The Cruel Sea. Which talks about pre-oil discovery life and when fishing was a predominant occupation. This initiated the film industry in Kuwait as it was one of the most famous and acknowledged feature film at that era. In 1976, Kuwait produced its second feature film The Wedding of Zain In The Gulf region, Kuwait considered as the birthplace of Khaleji culture and film industry. In the cinematic history of Kuwait there were few female actress who had a prominent role in shaping the cinema today. One of them is Hayat Al Fahad. She is one of the prominent Kuwaiti actresses in the industry, she also participated in the first feature Kuwaiti film Bas Ya Bahr. And Souad Abdullah who is considered an iconic actress who had a prominent role in shaping the Kuwaiti cinema today. In 1954 Kuwait National Cinema Company was established. Being the first leading entertainment company in Kuwait and in the Gulf. Moreover, in 2005 it released its Cinematic brand and theatre in the country, Cinescape. Cinescape created an environmental space for the audience to experience films in five different experiences with different features to its experience. Kuwait was the first country in the Middle east and the second worldwide after Australia to ease M-NET payment, making the audience's experiences in Cinescape effortless and easy.  History  Cinema in Kuwait was affected by the dominance of Hollywood on the cinematic world as most of the portrayed films were American made. It was dominated with Western movies, while the local television channels was dominated widely with Kuwaiti made movies and television series. Most of its portrayed films were in foreign languages imported from other countries. There is a clear dominance of Hollywood movies in Kuwaiti theaters. On average, the percentage of American movies are 80 percent, while other movie content produced by countries such as Egypt, India and Britain never exceeded 38 percent of the movies premiered. In a period of eight weeks only once a Kuwaiti made movie was shown in the cinemas. This is due to the fact that Kuwait is a rather small country that is saturated with expatriates. The domination of American film and other foreign produced films has the Kuwaiti cinema imitate and depend on it for so long. It was in 1971 that the young talent of Khalid Alsidiqqi that emerged and directed the first Kuwaiti feature film that talks about its cultural heritage and history. Kuwait began producing their own television content in 1961, which was early comparing to other countries in the region, thus it instantly gained popularity and admiration from surrounding gulf countries. This drove them forward to launch their own satellite. KTV 1 is one of the oldest television broadcast channels established in Kuwait. The Kuwaiti satellite was able to cover the gulf and reach further regions such as North America, which was difficult to accomplish at that time period in 1997. They had a vision which was ‚Äúto spread Kuwaiti produced news, information, and cultural programming all around the globe.‚Äù (P.434). they wanted to share their culture and convey it to other nationalities. Kuwait was and still named ‚Äòÿπÿ±Ÿàÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿÆŸÑŸäÿ¨‚Äô which translated to The Bride of The Gulf, this nickname was initiated by the Gulf countries to Kuwait for its history in films and music, etc. Kuwait is the birthplace of film in the Gulf, it was not until the release of Bas ya Bahr that it was recognized and known by Khalejis for its films and their artistry in showing the cultural and heritage of the Kuwaiti citizens and the Khaleji community in general. = Bas ya Bahr The Cruel Sea (1972) = Bas ya Bahr a film produced in Kuwait, directed by Khalid Alsiddiq, young and talented, showcased his skills through the movie.

The film was in black and white and its duration was an hour and 41 minutes. Before the drastic changes that took place in Kuwait due to the discovery of oil, pearl diving was one of the main income sources people had. The events happen to a typical Kuwaiti family, a young man seeks to marry the girl he loves ‚ÄúNura‚Äù however many obstacles come in his way. The first issue is that he does not have enough money to propose thus her father stands in their way. He wants to marry off his daughter to someone with a decent amount of money in possession. ‚ÄúMoussaed‚Äù insisting on his decision to pearl dive finds his father also preventing him from diving, fearful of the many dangers in the sea that his son could come across. Eventually his father allows him to pursue what he wants. Moussaed excessively trying hard to obtain the pearls lead to his death. In his final dive, he found a huge pearl that was taken to his family as a gesture of his braveness and determination. His mother then goes to sea with grief and sorrow in her heart and yells ‚ÄúBas ya Bahr‚Äù which translates in to ‚Äúenough of sea‚Äù.

Urs AL-Zayn The Wedding of Zein (1976)  It is the second feature film to be produced in Kuwait, it was directed by the famous Kuwaiti director Khalid Alsiddiq.

On the Harmful Effects of Tobacco () is a one- act play by Anton Chekhov. It has one character, Ivan Ivanovich Nyukhin. First published in 1886, the play was revised by Chekhov and is best known from his 1902 version. This was first published in English in The Unknown Chekhov (1954), a collection of writings. Plot The action takes place in a town hall. Nyukhin has been told by his wife to give a lecture about \\"the harmful effects of tobacco,\\" although he is a smoker. He emphasizes that this will be a dry and boring lecture, but always postpones the actual subject by talking about his problems with his domineering wife. > \\"I must tell you, by the way, that my wife runs a boarding school. Well, not > exactly a boarding school, but something in the nature of one. Just between > us, my wife likes to complain about hard times, but she has put away a > little nest egg... some forty or fifty thousand rubles. As for me, I haven't > a kopek to my name, not a penny... \\" He wants to stand up against his wife, he wants to run away, to forget and to be alone. He throws off his old, shabby waistcoat (a metaphor for himself), but suddenly picks it back up, because > \\"She is here. My wife is there in the wings waiting for me.\\" By the end of the monologue, Nyukhin has said hardly anything relevant about the harmful effects of tobacco, but asks the audience not to betray him: > \\"If she asks you, please, I beg you, tell her that her scarecrow husband, I > mean, the lecturer, me, behaved with dignity.\\" Publication history The play was originally published on 17 February 1886 by Peterburgskaya Gazeta, subtitled \\"The Monologue scene\\" (–°—Ü–µ–Ω–∞-–º–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥) and signed A.

The first English publication was by Ecco Press in The Unknown Chekhov (1954), a collection of writings.Chekhov, Anton P.: On the Harmful Effects of Tobacco, Literature, Arts and Medicine Database, New York University Adaptation Paul Newman directed a short film adaptation of On The Harmful Effects of Tobacco that received limited screening in New York City in 1962. Nyukhin was played by Michael Strong, who had performed the monologue to high praise in The Actors Studio. Despite a favorable mention in The New York Times, Newman removed his name from the credits for reasons that remain unclear. He gave the sole print to Strong, who kept it until his death in 1980. As of November 2016, Turner Classic Movies plans to air the film in early 2017. The play was also adapted and set to music composed by American Dominick Argento, in his A Water Bird Talk (1974‚Äì1976); he also used passages (and images in performance) from Audubon's Birds of America.

The game was released in North America on June 8, 1993, and in Europe in 1993. Run Saber features side-scrolling fighting as the two main heroes, and Sheena, the Run Sabers, fight to save the planet. The gameplay is very similar to Strider, Valis and some elements of Psycho Dream.  Gameplay  boss changed in appearance in the final game due to content guideline violations After choosing either the male character, Allen, or the female character, Sheena, the player is sent to five different levels around a fantastical Earth. Sheena has an ice affinity, while Allen has a lightning one. A third Saber, Kurtz, is aligned with fire, and is an enemy the player must fight several times. The players can use a slash attack (the standard attack) which Allen does forward and Sheena upward, use a mid-air kick, or use the Hyper Bomb (special pick up item). The players can also climb up and down walls and hang onto the ceiling. There is a power jump similar to the Screw Attack of Super Metroid. In each of the five levels (Taj Base, Tong City, Jodvalley, Grey Fac, and Bruford), there are multiple minor bosses and one final boss at the end of each level. These battles are noted when an alert message appears on the screen. In between each boss, the player must fight hordes of enemies and collect health pickups and weapon enhancers. Originally, the boss at the end of the Tong City level was supposed to be a woman lying on her side, however Nintendo felt that this violated their content guidelines as they did not want to depict or reference violence against women on their hardware, so the woman was changed into a dead woman and was approved.VideoGames & Computer Entertainment \\"Could It Be...?\\" Vol v. Issue 8. 1993 pg. 13.  Plot  Years into the future after Earth has been overly polluted and resources are running low, a scientist quickly comes up with a solution: a new chemical that will reverse the effects of pollution. As colonists settle in space to avoid the pollution, the newfound chemical is quickly launched in a missile into the atmosphere where it explodes and releases the chemical. However, the chemical begins to horribly mutate any and all humans infected with it. The scientist knew the effects of his chemical and uses the mutated people as his soldiers to rule the Earth. Humanity's only hope is a new weapon known as Project Saber, three cyborgs that are genetically enhanced to supernatural levels. Kurtz, the first Saber, malfunctions and escapes to Earth before the project is complete. The remaining Sabers, Allen and Sheena, are dispatched to eliminate the scientist and his militant mutant threat, and to neutralize Kurtz if possible.

His name \\"Mugo\\" means \\"a healer\\". Mugo wa Kibiru was born in Kariara, Murang'a, near Thika, but his exact dates of birth and death are unknown. There are various anecdotes regarding Chege wa Kibiru in Kikuyu folklore, but his claim to fame arose as a result of his accurate prophecies regarding the advent of the Caucasian (white man) on African soil long before British missionaries set their feet in Kenya. Chege's prophecies were that there would come a race of people whose skin complexion would resemble a small pale coloured frog that lives in water (kiengere) and one would be able to see their blood flowing under their skins just like the frog. And these pale strangers would have clothing that resembles butterflies (ciƒ©uhuruta) in their colourful aspect. And that these pale strangers would carry magical sticks that would produce fire (guns firing bullets), and it will be foolish for our warriors to confront them with their spears. Chege also prophesied that there would be a cultural erosion of tribal customs where Kikuyu youth would adopt the ways of the Caucasians. The Caucasians would also carry fire in their pockets (matchboxes). Cooked food previously never sold in Kikuyu custom, would be sold on roadsides and markets all over the country. The plains where the Maasai graze their cattle would be farmed. Chege prophesied the coming of the Uganda Railway line that would stretch from one body of water Indian Ocean in the east to another in the west Lake Victoria and described an iron snake that would have many \\"legs\\" like an earthworm (train), travelling on this railway line, eating the Caucasians and vomiting them when it stopped (train journey with passengers). According to the prophecy, the iron snake would have a bushy head bellowing smoke. Chege predicted with astonishing accuracy that there would be a famine in Kikuyuland that would exterminate much of the tribe right before the arrival of these pale coloured strangers or foreigners. The Sacred Tree Chege foretold that the Kikuyus and other tribes would be colonised by the Caucasians but that the colonisation would end after many years (68 years) with the result that the Caucasians would leave Kenya.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu_4M4T8UbE Chege predicted that a giant fig tree 15 feet in diameter located in Thika, 26 miles north of Nairobi, would wither and die by the day Kenya gained independence. Chege's prophecies had proved so accurate that the fig tree was regarded as sacred by the Kikuyus; even the British administrators/colonialists took the prophecy very seriously that they tended to and reinforced the fig tree with a mound of earth, and then built an iron ring around it to prevent it from falling. These measures were bound to fail. Shortly before Kenya gained independence from the British, the fig tree was struck by lightning and began to wither rapidly. On 12 December 1963 when Kenya officially became an independent state, the tree had decayed and died thereby fulfilling Chege wa Kibiru's prophecy over a century earlier.  Literature  Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong'o, 1965. The River Between Chege wa Kibiru appears as a secondary character in \\"The River Between\\" as Waiyaki's fore-father: \\"Had not Mugo Kibiru the great seer, in whose line Chege and his son run, talked about the coming of the white man? Mugo told people that 'You could not cut butterflies with a panga (machete or cutlass).... you could not spear them until you learnt their ways of movement, trap and fight back'\\"- page 20 - The River Between, Heinemann, 1965, 1989 (London); Ng√ªg√Æ wa Thiong'o, 1967. A Grain of Wheat Mugo wa Kibiru is mentioned in this literary classic. \\"It's (Mau Mau movement) origins can, so the people say, be traced to the day the whiteman came to the country, clutching the book of God in both hands, a magic witness that the whiteman was a messenger from the Lord. His tongue was coated with sugar: his humility was touching. For a time, people ignored the voice of the Gikuyu seer who once said: there shall come a people with clothes like the butterflies\\"- page 10 - A Grain of Wheat, Heineman, 1967, 1986, 2002 Heinemann (London); . \\"Waiyaki and other warrior-leaders took arms. The iron snake spoken of by Mugo wa Kibiro was quickly wriggling towards Nairobi for a thorough exploitation of the hinterland\\"- page 12 - A Grain of Wheat, 1967, 1986, 2002, Heinemann (London); . Mugia, D., 1979. ≈®rathi wa Cege wa Kibiru  Controversy  Some scholars cast doubt on these prophecies, claiming that Chege wa Kƒ©bir≈© must have heard about Caucasians and trains from Kikuyu traders who might have travelled to the coast for trade purposes. And it would certainly have been easy to know about guns, clothing, trains and railways from the Arabs and Caucasians with stories from Kikuyu traders reaching the hinterland from the coastal region where many Arabs and Caucasians carried out their trade. The question would then be; how did Chege know that the Uganda Railway would stretch from one body of water to another many years before the railway was laid out? Chege was long dead before the beginning of the railway construction in 1901. Furthermore, what about Chege's accurate prophecies regarding the falling of the giant fig tree signifying end of colonial rule, the great famine in the late 19th century, and the subsequent cultural erosion of African values and customs? Leakey says that trade contacts existed between Arabs and the Kikuyu for a while, and it is possible that these contacts existed only in certain parts of the Kikuyu nation and not everywhere. Boyes in his accounts testifies that he was the first white man that some Kikuyus in a particular region, saw, and that he was an object of great curiosity. Boyes states that he enjoyed demonstrating his \\"white powers\\" by shooting a hole through a soft barked tree with a rifle {Mutaarani, A Kikuyu Reader for Std.

History ChemSpider was acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) in May, 2009. Prior to the acquisition by RSC, ChemSpider was controlled by a private corporation, ChemZoo Inc. The system was first launched in March 2007 in a beta release form and transitioned to release in March 2008. ChemSpider has expanded the generic support of a chemistry database to include support of the wikipedia chemical structure collection via their WiChempedia implementation. Services A number of services are made available online. These include the conversion of chemical names to chemical structures, the generation of SMILES and InChI strings as well as the prediction of many physicochemical parameters and integration to a web service allowing NMR prediction. =SyntheticPages= SyntheticPages is a free interactive database of synthetic chemistry procedures operated by the Royal Society of Chemistry. Users submit synthetic procedures which they have conducted themselves for publication on the site. These procedures may be original works, but they are more often based on literature reactions. Citations to the original published procedure are made where appropriate. They are checked by a scientific editor before posting. The pages do not undergo formal peer-review like a scientific journal article but comments can be made by logged-in users. The comments are also moderated by scientific editors. The intention is to collect practical experience of how to conduct useful chemical synthesis in the lab. While experimental methods published in an ordinary academic journal are listed formally and concisely, the procedures in ChemSpider SyntheticPages are given with more practical detail. Informality is encouraged. Comments by submitters are included as well. Other publications with comparable amounts of detail include Organic Syntheses and Inorganic Syntheses. The SyntheticPages site was originally set up by Professors Kevin Booker-Milburn (University of Bristol), Stephen Caddick (University College London), Peter Scott (University of Warwick) and Dr Max Hammond. In February 2010 a merger was announced with the Royal Society of Chemistry's chemical structure search engine ChemSpider and the formation of ChemSpiderSyntheticPages (CSSP). =Open PHACTS= ChemSpider is serving as the chemical compound repository as part of the Open PHACTS project, an Innovative Medicines Initiative. Open PHACTS will deploy an open standards, open access, semantic web approach to address bottlenecks in small molecule drug discovery - disparate information sources, lack of standards and information overload.

Life Mendel was born in Delhi, New York, son of Benedict Mendel, a merchant born in Aufhausen, Germany in 1833, and Pauline Ullman, born in Eschenau, Germany. His father immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1851, his mother in 1870.\\"Lafayette Benedict Mendel.\\" World of Biology. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Thomson Gale. 2006. At 15, he won a New York State scholarship. Mendel studied classics, economics and the humanities, as well as biology and chemistry at Yale University and graduated with honors in 1891.Arthur H. Smith, \\"Lafayette B. Mendel, Companion in Research\\", American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 12(4):261-263. He then began graduate work at the Sheffield Scientific School on a fellowship and studied physiological chemistry under Russell Henry Chittenden. He finished his Ph.D. 1893 after only two years; his thesis topic was the study of the seed storage protein edestin extracted from hemp seed. Upon graduation, he began as an assistant at the Sheffield School in Physiological chemistry. He also studied in Germany and was made an assistant professor on his return in 1896. He became a full professor in 1903 with appointments in the Yale School of Medicine and the Yale Graduate School as well as Sheffield. With Chittenden, Mendel became one of the founders of the science of nutrition. Together with longtime collaborator Thomas B. Osborne he established essential amino acids. As early as 1910 he found an important growth factor...later to be known as vitamin B. In 1903, at age 31, he was appointed full professor of physiological chemistry. In promoting Mendel, Yale made him one of the first high-ranking Jewish professors in the United States. Capping his illustrious career Mendel was appointed Sterling Professor of Physiological Chemistry in 1921. Of the twenty professors to be designated Sterling professors in the decade following their inception in 1920, only two were selected before Mendel. Of the twenty, Mendel was the only Jew.Dan A. Oren, \\"Joining the Club, A History of Jews and Yale\\", pages 113-114; Yale University Press, New Haven & London,1985 Mendel wrote over 100 papers with Osborne of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, where Mendel was also an appointee. In their early work, they studied the deadly poison ricin which is classified as a type 2 ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) from castor beans. He was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences. ;Vitamin A discovery Mendel and Osborne's most important work involved the use of carefully controlled studies on rats to study the necessary elements in a healthy diet. They discovered Vitamin A in 1913 in butter fat - independently discovered by Elmer McCollum and Marguerite Davis, who submitted their publication first, with both papers appearing in the same issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry - as well as water-soluble vitamin B in milk. They showed, for example, that a lack of Vitamin A in the diet led to xerophthalmia. They also established the importance of lysine and tryptophan in a healthy diet.\\"Lafayette Benedict Mendel.\\"Dictionary of American Biography, Supplements 1-2: To 1940.

The park sits across the Illinois River from Starved Rock State Park, just south of the Illinois and Michigan Canal trail. According to legend, it was once used as a \\"blind canyon\\" for Indians to capture buffalo. Effigy Tumuli, an art exhibit on the park property, consists of five earth art animal sculptures native to the Illinois River. It was constructed as a tribute to Native American tradition. The park is located east of Utica, Illinois (Starved Rock State Park), and approximately southwest of Chicago, Illinois. Its sandstone bluffs were carved by the Illinois River near the end of the Pleistocene epoch (the most recent ice age), and now serves as a State Park for local residents and tourists.  History  The area of Buffalo Rock, the Village of La Vantum, was the home of the Illinois Indians when Louis Jolliet, the French explorer, and the Jesuit missionary priest Father Jacques Marquette made their trip up the Illinois River in 1673. In August of 1680 the Illinois Tribe was virtually annihilated in protracted warfare with the aggressive Iroquois. Buffalo Rock State Park served as an early military, trading, and missionary post for the French. During the winter of 1682-1683, LaSalle and Tonty built Fort St. Louis on Starved Rock, and gathered 4,000 Indian warriors at Buffalo Rock to form a confederation against the Iroquois. The Miami, one of the tribes in the confederation, built their own fort on Buffalo Rock. During the State Park's later years, it was used as a religious sect as a place for holding camp meetings, and was recently used for a tuberculosis sanatorium. In 1912, the Crane Company of Chicago purchased Buffalo Rock and maintained a sanatorium for employees and a summer vacation home for employees and family members. The company moved to a recreational park and donated the land in 1927 for Buffalo Rock to become a state park. On November 15, 1928, the deed of the property was turned over to the State of Illinois with provisions that it would become a permanent state park. As a reward for his loyal services, Robert Barnett, the 72-year-old caretaker, he was retained to the land for the remainder of his life. An American Bison Grazing Wildlife Many animals can be seen and heard within the park, but two American Bison reside here. They have a pen and grazing field which is located across from the baseball diamond and can be seen daily.  Trails  The state park currently has two trails: the River Bluff Trail and the Woodland Trail. The River Bluff Trail runs above the Illinois River and has two observation decks that provide views of the river. The Woodland Trail runs deeper into the park, providing an opportunity for close-up viewing of trees, plants, and wildlife within the park.  Camping  There are three primitive camping sites between Buffalo Rock and Utica, Illinois. A fire ring is provided at each campsite, but water and restroom facilities are not. The sites are accessible via biking or walking only - vehicles are not allowed. One of the three camping sites is dedicated to youth campers, where a shelter with a fireplace can be found. Prior to camping, permits must be obtained from Buffalo Rock State Park at the information center.  Effigy Tumuli  The Effigy Tumuli earthwork consists of five animal sculptures as tribute to ancient Native American tradition, mound building. The five animals that are depicted are a water strider, a turtle, a catfish, a frog, and a snake which is measured from head to toe. The water strider, catfish, and frog are built from mounds of dirt, grass, shrubbery, and exposed earth, while the turtle and snake use the geographic landscape to their advantage. The turtle's shell is formed as a mound with rock that dips into the river. The snake curves and dips down into the river down . Effigy Tumuli is one of the largest artworks in the country and must be seen from an aerial view in order to view the massive artworks. The site was owned by Ottawa Silica Company, who had an interest in art, and commissioned the sculptures to Michael Heizer in 1983 who used heavy equipment to finish the project 2 years later in 1985. Visitors can walk a trail through the site (which is long), and are invited to climb upon the artworks and read interpretive signs and maps to help visualize what they are looking at. A picnic shelter with a stone fireplace  Picnicking  Buffalo Rock State Park has two shelters dedicated for picnickers, or family and friends outings. Both shelters offer grills, picnic tables, water fountains available for drink, and restrooms located nearby. The larger of the two shelters comes complete with a stone fireplace and may be reserved, while the smaller shelter has a first- come, first-served basis. A playground is located near the larger shelter and a baseball diamond is located in the center of the park.

Born in 1830 to Willam Borst and Nancy Ann Bookout. Borst was raised in Tioga County, New York. In 1850, Borst traveled to California during the California Gold Rush. He used the proceeds to rent a farm near Sacramento. He moved to Seattle around 1858. His brother Joseph Borst had previously moved to Oregon Territory in 1846 Oregon Bigraphical Index Card File and his sister Diana Borst Collins to Nisqually in 1847. In the spring of 1858, Borst was on his way to Eastern Washington over the Cedar River trail, decided that the Snoqualmie Valley was too good to pass up. He moved into an abandoned building at Fort Alden, at present Snoqualmie. He raised hogs and apples and carried the goods for sale back to Seattle. He owned land in what is now Snoqualmie and North Bend. In 1865, Borst accompanied Seattle pioneer Arthur Denny, William Perkins and a Snoqualmie native guide visited Snoqualmie Pass to make a plan to widen the trail to a wagon road. He oversaw construction of the first road through the pass in 1868. While in the Valley, Borst married first a woman named Sally. She died around 1867. He married secondly Mina Kanim in 1868Washington Marriage Records.

History Sister Virginia Bento and the members of her council chose to establish in Warren, Bristol County because they perceived a need for a girls' high school in this area. As a Catholic Institution, FATIMA would provide a solid academic foundation for its students in preparation for college, and help them to strengthen their faith to become Christian leaders in the tradition of St. Paula Frassinetti, foundress of the Sisters of St. Dorothy. FATIMA opened on September 8, 1965 with 55 students. At that time, the school building consisted of classrooms (one of which was converted into a chapel), a library, science and art laboratories, and a double room to be used for several purposes. The school also served as housing for the sisters who were members of the staff. The gymnasium and cafeteria were completed in 1969, in time for the first graduation ceremonies while the convent was ready for occupancy in 1977. As a private institution, owned and operated by the Sisters of St. Dorothy, all funding for the school was provided by them. The principals have been Sisters, J. Sousa, Isabel Borg-Cardona, Mary Ann Campanelli, Lillian Cravinho, Eileen Egan and Mary Margaret Souza. The faculty originally consisted only of religious sisters. After a brief period of time, a layman was hired to teach social studies and physical education. Since its opening, courses have been modernized, including the addition of a computer lab and a full-time computer teacher. On top of that, grades 7 and 8 were added to the school. In 1985, the 20th anniversary of the foundation of the school, and the year that the foundress of the sisters of St. Dorothy was canonized, FATIMA became co-educational. This decision was made primarily because of the declining enrollment rate. Sadly, the school closed in 2012. Highlander Charter School moved into the building in 2014.

It is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List since July 2008, as part of the inscription: \\"Cave of Altamira and palaeolithic cave art of Northern Spain.\\"Lamalfa, Carlos and Pe√±il, Javier, 'Las cuevas de Puente Viesgo', in Cuevas de Espa√±a (Editorial Everest, Le√≥n, 1991). It is located in the heart of the uniprovincial community, in the middle of the Pas River valley, around the cave of Hornos de la Pena and Monte Castillo, in the same group of caves as Las Monedas, Las Chimeneas, and the cave of El Castillo. The caves of Monte Castillo form an amazingly complete series, both as regards the material culture of the Old Stone Age and from an artistic point of view. La Pasiega is basically an enormous gallery, its known extent more than 120 meters, that runs more or less parallel to the slope of the mount, opening to the surface at six different places: six small mouths, the majority obstructed, of which two can be accessed for inspection. The principal gallery is approximately 70 meters and opens to deeper secondary galleries, winding and labyrinthine, which in places broaden out to form large chambers. Thus one refers to \\"room II-VIII\\", the room called \\"Gallery B\\", or \\"room 11\\" of \\"Gallery C\\", all with paleolithic decorations. The two last mentioned rooms contain some of the rock sanctuaries that will be mentioned below. The recorded remains belong mainly to the Upper Solutrean and the Lower Magdalenian ages, although older objects are also found. In 2018 uranium- thorium dating revealed a scalariform (ladder shaped) symbol to be older than 64,000 years and therefore made by Neanderthals. Throughout the cave are many 'walls' with paintings and with engraved or incised images. There are representations of equines (horses), cervids (deer, male and female) and bovines (cattle). There are also many abstract symbols (ideomorphs). Discovery The scientific discovery of the La Pasiega can be credited to Werner and Hugo Obermaier. While excavating the Cave of El Castillo in 1911, they received news that the workers knew of another cavity nearby, which villagers called \\"La Pasiega.\\" The investigators soon confirmed that the cave contained rock paintings. Later, Henri Breuil, Hugo Obermaier, and Hermilio Alcalde del R√≠o began their systematic study of the cave. However, the study could not be finished due to Henri Breuil's ongoing work on his magnum opus.Breuil, H., Alcalde del R√≠o, H., and Sierra, L., Les Cavernes de la R√©gion Cantabrique (Espagne), Ed. A. Ch√™ne. (Monaco 1911). A separate monograph was necessary, and was published in 1913.Breuil, H., Obermaier, H., and Alcalde del R√≠o, H., La Pasiega √† Puente Viesgo, Ed. A. Ch√™ne (M√≥naco, 1913)Both publications were issued in Monaco because it was Prince Alberto I of Monaco who was patron of the investigations, ever since he had visited the site in 1909. He was a great lover of archaeology, supported this excavation and others greatly, and one of the fossil humans is named in his honour \\"Grimaldi Man\\", one of many names given to Homo sapiens fossilis). The study was crucial to advance prehistoric science in Spain.

ISSN 1131-6993. In 1903 Alcalde del R√≠o had discovered the cave El Castillo, and, as noted, Obermaier carried out excavations between 1910 and 1914. The excavations were continued at various times, intermittently, until our own times, by qualified specialists.Cabrera, V., Bernaldo de Quir√≥s F. et al. (2004), 'Excavaciones en El Castillo: Veinte a√±os de reflexiones', in Neandertales cant√°bricos, estado de la cuesti√≥n, vol. Actas de la Reuni√≥n Cient√≠fica, N¬∫ 20-22 (October) (Museo de Altamira, Ministerio de Cultura 2004). Ultimately the investigation was taken up by the archaeologists Rodrigo de Balb√≠n Behrmann and C√©sar Gonz√°lez Sainz. After the discovery of \\"La Pasiega\\" and the first campaigns, the area was little visited ‚Äî mainly owing to the difficult historical circumstances of Spain in the 1930s. After this, in 1952, while a eucalyptus plantation was being put in, another cave was found with a small monetary treasure of the 17th century: hence the new cave was called \\"Las Monedas\\": in it, however, was found a rock sanctuary with important pictures and drawings. In light of this, the engineer Alfredo Garc√≠a Lorenzo concluded that Monte Castillo held more secrets. Therefore, a geological survey was set in motion which resulted the following year in the discovery of another cave with rock paintings, \\"Las Chimeneas\\" (\\"The Chimneys\\"), and also other covachas of lesser importance such as \\"La Flecha\\", \\"Casta√±era\\", \\"Lago\\" etc. Other archeologists The cave, because it had remains of the primary Cantabrian Solutrean and Magdalenian epochs, provided the basis for a chronological series for the 'wall' paintings. The excavations were old, most recently conducted by Dr. Jesus Carballo in 1951. There was a base level with ambiguous artefacts which, by their characteristics, seemed related to a possible Mousterian phase. Above that there rested a comparatively rich Solutrean level with very characteristic implements such as 'feuilles de laurier' (leaf-points) and notched points with the finest working produced by light pressure-flaking, like light javelin points. This level could be attributed accurately to the Upper Solutrean. The most recent layer was also relatively rich, with various burins (borers), striker pins, and perforated objects of bone and that could belong to the Lower Magdalenian. Certainly, compared with the stratigraphical significance of El Castillo, La Pasiega is an archeological sequence of less organization, so far as the materials yet found are concerned.This evaluation carries the caveat that it depends on the archaic system of excavation which existed in Spain in the 1950s and before. In fact it is a notorious and proven fact that in the spoil-heaps of those old works carried out at Monte Castillo, one can find discarded specimens which are really objects of archaeological importance. However they should certainly not be less valued for this. Cave paintings On the plan proposed by Andr√© Leroi-Gourhan, La Pasiega can be taken as a good example of the \\"Cave as Sanctuary\\", or to be more precise as a collection of sanctuaries of different epochs, arranged according to certain models. In fact this idea developed in the thoughts of the distinguished French prehistorian precisely when he visited the Cantabrian caves, while he was participating in a group of foreign investigators who were excavating in the cave of El Pendo during the 1950s. \\"I can definitely confirm that the study of the rock art of northern Spain was decisive in the master's ideas, which since then have become famous through his many publications.\\"Gonzalez Echegaray 1994, 'Consideraciones preliminares sobre el arte rupestre cant√°brico', in Complutum, Vol. 5, New Series of publications of the Complutense University of Madrid. For Leroi-Gourhan, this type of cave has a rather complex spatial or topographical hierarchy in which it is possible to discern principal groups of animals (bos facing equus, forming a duality), which occupy the most conspicuous or preferred areas, complemented by secondary animals (deer, goat, etc.) and other more occasional species which however fulfil their subsidiary function: on the other hand it is usual that the ideomorphic symbols appear in peripheral or marginal areas, or in those which are difficult to reach:Leroi-Gourhan, Andr√©, 'Consideraciones sobre la organizaci√≥n espacial de las figuras animales en el arte parietal paleol√≠tico', in S√≠mbolos, Artes y Creencias de la Prehistoria (Editorial Istmo, Madrid 1984). > Animals and symbols correspond, therefore, to the same basic formulae, > logically binary and even defended by the fact that animals of the same > species appear frequently in pairs, male and female, though the dispositivo > is so complex that we ought not suppose an explanation purely based in the > symbolism of fertility; the first element is the presence of two species A-B > (horse-bison); confronted with two types of signs, masculine and feminine, > an attempt to attribute to the horse and bison the same symbolic value or, > at least, a bivalency of the same kind as that of the symbols of the two > categories (S1 and S2)Leroi-Gourhan, Andr√©, 'Los hombres prehist√≥ricos y la > Religi√≥n', in S√≠mbolos, Artes y Creencias de la Prehistoria (Editorial > Istmo, Madrid 1984). It is supposed that there are exceptions to this rule, many variants which depend on regions and epochs, the significance of which is not entirely clear in its general outline, but which should be explained in a particular way, also at La Pasiega.

ISSN 1131-6993. have made various counts of the species of animal represented, one of which reckoned more than 700 painted forms in this cave, among others: 97 deer (69 females and 28 males), 80 horses, 32 ibex, 31 cattle (17 bison and 14 aurochs), two reindeer, a carnivorous animal, a chamois, a megaloceros, a bird and a fish; also there may be a mammoth and about 40 quadrupeds not clearly identified; also the ideomorphs, such as roof-shaped and other surprisingly varied symbols (more than 130), and very often including various anthropomorphs and hundreds of marks and partly erased traces. =Gallery A, 1st Sanctuary= Plan and layout of the rock images of Gallery A, 1st Sanctuary To get into Gallery A it is necessary to descend by a little well, but originally one could go in by another entrance which, however, is now thoroughly blocked by stalactites and by collapses from outside. The gallery runs to a depth of 95 meters (from the present entrance), but it gets narrower and it is not possible to know whether it continues beyond. Entering into the cave, one passes a blocked entrance on the right, and between 60 and 70 meters depth appears the connection to Gallery B, slightly before the most interesting collection of pictures. Then at a bit more than 75 meters it seems that the sanctuary (properly so-called) begins, with more than 50 deer (the majority female), the horses about half that number, and the cattle (aurochs and bison) fewer, strategically placed dominating the most visible places. In this sanctuary there have been found an anthropomorph, a vulva, linear and dotted symbols, a square and a great quantity of tectiforms, about as many as the deer. The paintings can be put together in various groups, paying attention, above all, to dating criteria, but also technical and thematic sequence which unfolds like clockwork. These groups seem schematized with the semiotic zoological conventions unravelled by Leroi-Gourhan.Leroi-Gourhan, 'Consideraciones sobre la organizaci√≥n espacial de las figuras animales en el arte parietal paleol√≠tico', in S√≠mbolos, Artes y Creencias de la Prehistoria (Editorial Istmo, Madrid 1984), p.: 453) identifies the figures of animals and signs with the following notation: { border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:80%; margin:auto;\\"  * A: Horse * B: Cattle ** B1: Bison ** B2: Aurochs * C: Peripheral animals ** C1: Deer ** C2: Mammoth ** C3: Ibex ** C4: Reindeer Others are * P: Fish * S: Sign ** S1: Sign signifying male ** S2: Sign signifying female * M: Hand or sign in the form of a hand * H: Male anthropomorph * F: Female anthropomorph * ?: Figure or mark (not identified) } The First Large Group is on the left hand wall of the gallery, including figures arranged as a double frieze with numerous deer, mostly female, and also plenty of horses and a bison which is at the centre of the composition. Between them are symbols which stress the association of the vulva and the rod, the male-female distinction. The group brings out the theme of Bison-Horse which can also be interpreted as the same type of dualism. The group is completed by another little group of horses, the remaining animals being in the centre and the upper part of the frieze, where there are only hinds and ideomorphs. { style=\\"margin:auto;\\" Grouping arrangement, First Group, Gallery A The bison‚Äìhorse opposition (with a giant deer), from the First Group, Gallery A } The techniques of execution include outlines for hinds and bison, linear drawing (between outline and modelling) and, only in two places, partial tinta plana (selective infilling) is used (for the heads of certain hinds). The dominant color, without any doubt, is red, but in a small way yellow and purplish red also appear. Engraving was not used in this group. After this one finds a series of groupings of less organization, more or less connected with these, on the left wall of the gallery: in them appear every kind of figure that, certainly, complement the following group. They are clearly dominated by deer in association with some ideomorphs and a few cattle (possibly aurochs), which seem to stand in relation to the horses in the group which next appears round a corner. The Second Large Group begins around a bend to the left, in the end area of the gallery, where it becomes narrow: it brings together figures on one side and the other. This time the horses and the deer are almost equal in number, as usual at La Pasiega, and fewer but not less important are the cattle, two of which are bison. Also there is a possible feminine anthopomorph and about thirty rectangular tectiform symbols, positioned in the way that seems to be usual in this type of cave sanctuary: > \\"The symbols, in general, occupy a separate space from the animals, either > in the borders of the panels, or running into a niche or hollow, or a cranny > more or less nearby. Even so, there are reasons to think that the signs are > placed in relation to the same animals.\\"Leroi-Gourhan, 'Consideraciones > sobre la organizaci√≥n espacial de las figuras animales en el arte parietal > paleol√≠tico', in S√≠mbolos, Artes y Creencias de la Prehistoria (Editorial > Istmo, Madrid 1984). The cattle are concentrated on the right side, together with three of the horses, forming the nucleus of the binary dialectic arrangement of this second group, and moreover, there is also included with them the anthropomorph, all surrounded by the typical peripheral animals (deer) and ideomorphs. On the left wall, together with more deer, the other five horses which apparently stand in binary relation to the cattle painted before the bend, which have been mentioned in the earlier description. At the end of the gallery, which is starting to turn into a narrow defile, there are rectangular signs on either side. { style=\\"margin:auto;\\" The bison‚Äìhorse confrontation (complemented by a tectiform sign, from the 'Second Group' of Gallery A Grouping formula of the Second Group, Gallery A } Nearby, in a little recess there is a third group of lesser extent. In this are five deer, an ibex and a bovid, all complemented by seven quadrangular signs, one of them shaped like the segment of an orange. The arrangement seems clear in principle: the pictures of the two walls form two confrontations, on one side the bovid with some deer and idiomorphic signs; this confronts the horses which, in this way, align themselves with the bison, and the rest of the deer, the signs, and the goat. All this large complex of paintings is predominantly in modeled outline drawing in red. The Third Large Group is sited on a stalagmite formation which hangs from the vault (such as has the speleological name bandera), between the first group already described and the last, which will be described below. The two groups, although they are near to one another, are executed in a different techniqueThe article refers to these groups of different method in order to give weight of attention, by their physical nearness, to their different techniques of execution. giving rise to the suspicion that they were created in different periods. There are about ten hinds, also several horses (though not so many), two cattle and a square symbol. Coming from the entrance direction, one sees first most of the hinds, followed by the association of the horses, below which are the symbol and the remaining hinds. { style=\\"margin:auto;\\" Hinds painted in red in 'tinta plana', Third Group, Gallery A Grouping formula, 3rd Group, Gallery A Grouping formula, 4th Group, Gallery A } The predominant technique, for its warmth and for its frequency of use, is the tinta plana - the plane or block color ‚Äì either combined with black lines forming an outline in a sort of two-color method (as occurs on one of the horses), or emphasized with engraved lines which define details (this can be seen on various hinds), or enclosed, with scraffito in the rock to add chiaroscuro textures, as happens with a hind painted in red. Three of the horses and the head of another are black, the square sign is yellow, and the remainder of the figures are red. The Fourth (and last) Large Group, placed facing the group just described, is in a very close relationship to it, containing a similar number of deer and horses, together with a pair of bison. Among the various symbols an ideomorph in the shape of a hand is prominent, reminiscent of those at Santi√°n,Jord√° Cerd√°, Francisco, 'Los estilos en el arte parietal magdaleniense cant√°brico,' in Curso de Arte rupestre paleol√≠tico, (Publicaciones de la UIMP , Santander-Zaragoza, 1978), p. 98. and a red sign which could well be meant for a grotesque bison head. In the central position appear a horse and a bison, forming the typical binary combination, at one end other bison and at the opposite end the remaining horses. There is no tinta plana, no engraving and no two-color work: on the contrary, it is predominantly (more or less modeled) outline work in red. =Gallery B, 2nd Sanctuary= Plan and schema of the rock paintings of Gallery B, 2nd Sanctuary Entering through Gallery A, after 60 or 70 meters, through a tunnel on the right, the first big room of Gallery B is met with. Fairly far away from the entrance which is used nowadays there are various old exits to the exterior which have become blocked with the passage of time. One of them has been made into an opening, but it is not known whether, in the epoch in which this area was decorated, any of these were usable, which would be a help in understanding the point of view which the prehistoric artists would have taken in conceptualizing the zonal arrangement and levels of the room's decoration.Above this lack of information, the contents are limited to the present condition of the cave. A second problem concerns the available material which has not been described in Gallery A, being in that case the figures shown in the monograph (Breuil, Obermaier y Alcalde Del R√≠o, op. cit, 1913) shown on unassociated sheets, out of context, in a way that one cannot reconstruct how to obtain a realistic idea of the complete arrangement of the panels. The inventory tells of the cumulative effect but not the numerical proportions of their composition. This problem recurs in the pictorial groups of Gallery C. Nor is there a detailed study of the structure of the panels of the annex room discovered in 1964 by Joaqu√≠n Gonz√°lez Echegaray and Eduardo Ripoll Perell√≥ (1964): 'Nuevos grabados y pinturas en las cuevas del Monte Castillo', in Zephyrus, Revista de Prehistoria y Arqueolog√≠a, vol. XV, N¬∫ Universidad de Salamanca. ISSN 0514-7336. The pictorial density of this room is less than in Gallery A, with which it is partly to be associated. Among its depictions there is a roughly equal number of deer and horses, with a lesser number of cattle, following the customary pattern of this cave. But it is outstanding for the originality of some of its other figures, including a fish, a large ibex and ideomorphs like rods, key-shapes and an unprecedented little group of symbols popularly known as \\"The Inscription\\". Image:La Pasiega-Galer√≠a B-panel 53.svgPanel 53 Image:La Pasiega-Galer√≠a B-panel 55.svgPanels 54 and 55 Image:La Pasiega-Galer√≠a B-panel 57.svgPanel 57 So far as it has been possible to observe, the arrangement of all these figures amounts to a careful scheme of introduction to the main panels of Gallery A, supposing that this might have been the main entrance. At the entry (from Gallery A) is a little engraved hind, and later, signs of the kind named alfa by Leroi-Gourhan (that is to say, masculine), which appear on both sides of the gallery. Following the constructed entrance, on the right appears a fish, followed by a large male deer (stag) together with a little hind (both in black). Immediately before reaching the centre of the large room there appear signs on both sides, but this time they are of the beta type (feminine), red in color. The crowning feature of this sanctuary consists of three groups or panels which repeat the scheme of cattle-horse complemented by secondary animals or without them. There are three other panels in which only horses appear, several of them on the same stalagmite columns, others on the walls. In this nucleus a hand in positive depiction is emphasised, not mutilated, but with six fingers!: a grill-shaped symbol, some unidentified animal engraved in striated lines and the only male ibex of the room. Image:La Pasiega-Galeria B-Gran Ciervo (panel 59).pngDeer painted in red, panel 59 Image:La Pasiega-Galeria B-Numero 50.pngEngraved horse, panel 50 Image:La Pasiega-Galeria B-Numero 51.pngHorse painted in black, panel 51 Image:La Pasiega-Galeria B-Numero 47.pngMale ibex painted in black, panel 47 The techniques employed by the painters recall, partly, those of Gallery A (which is why they have come to be considered as related rooms): red painting, between modeled and outline, red block coloring (tinta plana), with some internal modeling achieved by scraffito to the underlying rock and by the addition of lines of the same color but in more intense shades. The most important difference is the copious use of engraving, both simple and striated, applied specially to the horses. =Gallery C (room XI), 3rd Sanctuary= Plan and schema of the rock paintings of Gallery C, 3rd Sanctuary Access to Gallery C is found, after entering the cave, by a way through to the left crossing Gallery D. Along there opens \\"Room XI\\" of Gallery C. This, in the same way as Gallery B, has direct communication with the outside, despite the fact that it is obstructed by rubble and rocks which have certainly been introduced. Once again, the perception of the arrangement of the pictures is changed for the observer by the problem of the blocked entrances, as we have noticed in the second Sanctuary. Leroi-Gourhan differentiates two clear parts to this sanctuary, located in separate places within the same room, and with different themes, technique and chronology.Leroi-Gourhan, Andr√© (1972): 'Considerations sur l'organisation spatiales des figures animales, dans l'art parietal pal√©olithique,' in las Actas del Symposium Internacional de Arte Prehist√≥rico, vol. Santander, N¬∫ pp. 281-308. This article is translated (into Spanish) as a chapter in: Leroi-Gourhan, Andr√©: 'Consideraciones sobre la organizaci√≥n espacial de las figuras animales en el arte parietal paleol√≠tico', in S√≠mbolos, Artes y Creencias de la Prehistoria (Editorial Istmo, Madrid, 1984). In addition there are two ibexes in the original monograph indicated at number 67, produced in partial block color by a kind of modeling and black in color, a method which is not found in any of the remaining figures of the room. The First Large Group of Room XI is the one found mainly around the presumed original entrance, now blocked. It contains mainly hinds, some stags, various cattle and a pair of horses, and also there is a goat. There are other symbols difficult to identify, some seeming to be animals, others anthropomorphs, and there is a positive hand impression colored black, dotted signs, rod signs, and other ideomorphs, among which stands out the so-called \\"Trampa\\" (a kind of column which encloses, behind a symbol, a bison and a hind (more will be said of this anon). The arrangement of this group seems to correspond to a threefold or ternary structure with variations: bos-equus-cervus with various signs or bos-equus-anthropomorph with signs. The truth is that the complexity of this panel is great, given the concentration of very varied figures. Image:La Pasiega-Galeria C-Macho Cabrio.pngMale ibex painted in black with modeled lines in Gallery C Image:La Pasiega-Galer√≠a C-paneles 74-75.svgScheme of the wall depictions in panel 74-75 of Gallery C Image:La Pasiega-Galer√≠a C-panel 79.svgScheme of the wall depictions of panel 79 of Gallery C Clearly the dominant technique is red outline drawing, but in one of the panels is also found, for some deer, striated engraving of very fine execution: also, there are various figures in black. In addition, there is two-color work on one of the cattle, in which red block painting and black lines are combined, this time a repainting of different date. The presumed anthropomorph seems to contain up to three colors, not a very usual thing in palaeolithic art (red, black and yellow). There are some yellow figures. The Second Large Group is around the access area to Zone D, that is, on the opposite side of the room. The species represented show predominantly horses, followed by cattle, and fewer but certainly present are deer and ibex (for which the symbols are complementary to the foregoing group). The symbols are of indeterminate number, and are of distinct kind, including key-shaped and feather-shaped ones, and also barred and dotted ones. The reduction in number of the deer does not happen in any other parts of the cave, where they are in the majority, whereas the proportion of horses is increased. Image:La Pasiega-Galeria C-panel 86.svgScheme of the wall depictions of panel 86 of Gallery C Image:La Pasiega-Galer√≠a C-Panel 86.pngOverlay of painting and engraving, Gallery C Image:La Pasiega-Galeria C-panel 83.svgScheme of wall depictions of panel 81-83 of Gallery C Image:La Pasiega-Galer√≠a C-numero 83.pngBison in dark coloration from panel 83, Gallery Here the arrangement is also complex. All the ideomorphs are in the area nearest to the cave mouth, and the overlays show repaintings, maybe in distinct periods. There are three possible sub-groups of horses without cattle (only two of the compositions are the typical A-B which have been observed up to this point). However, there are plenty of isolated figures, above all round the entrance to the room from Zone D. The dominant techniques are engraving of multiple lines, as if striated, and black painting: the yellows, reds and ochres are fewer. However, there is an example of the two-color work, in one representation, although it is not very prominent. As we have seen, the technique is also distinct from that of the earlier group and confirms the separation of the two areas within the room. =Zone D= This is an intermediate part of the cave, which is probably an extension of the sanctuary of Gallery C, like a 'grey area', with much fewer and more sporadic images among which there is little coherency, apart from a pair of small groups which continue to repeat the theme of the cattle and horse dualism. =Differences between the sanctuaries= Taken together, one can see clear differences between the various 'sanctuaries'. That of Gallery A, which is the most substantial, has no engraved work apart from a few images in which it is combined with block color painting; on the other hand, tamponado method is very important, combined with other techniques of painting basically in red; the ibex is very scarce, but the deer are almost double in number to the horses and five times more frequent than the cattle. There are many rectangular tectiform ideomorphs. In Gallery B, which has fewer images, one notices the absence of tamponado, while engraving (simple or striated) gains importance. The deer here are fewer, except in the room which was found in the 1960s; and the ideomorphs are completely different, with the so-called 'inscription' outstanding for its uniqueness. Gallery C has, so to say, two independent sanctuaries, both with striated engraving, but while the first present images which are mainly red, in the second they are mainly black; here the goats attain an importance not seen in the rest of the cave, and the ideomorphs are fairly unusual, particularly those painted in red. Although both Gallery A and Gallery C have dual-color work, the methods are different in each case. The ideomorphs of La Pasiega The ideomorphs ‚Äì and possible anthropomorphs ‚Äì of La Pasiega are listed and classified as: * Dotted signs: These are the simplest symbols in the cave. Generally they appear in two forms, one of which has many dots, usually not associated with animals, but with other ideomorphs to which they are complementary. They are commonest in Galleries B and C, in the latter the groups of many dots seem related to deer, but the symbols are painted and the animals engraved, from which it is possible to deduce that they are of different periods. Image:La Pasiega- Galeria A-panel 46.pngLarge group of dots Image:La Pasiega-Galeria A-panel 48.pngSmall group of dots Image:La Pasiega-Galeria A-panel 16.pngHorse head associated with two large groups of dots Image:La Pasiega-Galeria A-panel 44.pngHorse head associated with a small group of dots In the second type, the dots can appear much more loosely grouped. Then it is certainly possible to associate them with animals without too much uncertainty. The small groups of dots always appear once or twice in each room combined with cattle. But there are two very distinct cases in Gallery A in which horses have an aureole of dots, and these are confronted one to the other as at the entrance to the room mentioned. The dotted forms are most common during the Solutrean period. * Linear signs: These are more varied and complex both in their morphology and in their associations (there are examples shaped like arrows, branches, feathers, simple lines called rods (bastoncillos), etc.). They are sometimes associated with hinds. For example, one of the foremost panels of gallery A has these kinds of ideomorphs associated with a vulva and a hind. In the second group of Gallery C there is a bison (panel 83) which may have a linear sign associated (it looks like a javelin, but that idea is very controversial), as well as some other symbol. At the side is a feather-shaped symbol grouped with other key-shaped (claviform) ones (discussed below) which were not identified in the original monograph (but became known through an article by Leroi-GourhanLeroi-Gourhan, Andr√© (1958), 'La fonction des signes dans les sanctuaires pal√©olitiques,' in Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Pr√©historique Fran√ßaise, vol. 55, N¬∫ Fasc√≠culos 7-8. ISSN 0249-7638). Image:La Pasiega- Galeria A-panel 37.pngRods Image:La Pasiega-Galeria B-panel 60.pngBar and dot signs Image:La Pasiega-Galeria C-panel 79.pngArrow-shaped sign Image:La Pasiega-Galeria C-panel 82.pngFeather-shaped sign Finally there is a series of signs involving rods which appear in the entries to Galleries B and C. Breuil interpreted this type of sign in relation to the topographical changes within the sanctuary, which is possible: they could be marks which the initiates followed, or which warned them of possible dangers such as clefts.Breuil, Henri (1952), Quatre cents si√®cles d'Art pari√©tal (New Edition by Max Fourny, Par√≠s), pp. 373-374. Certainly the difficult areas of the cave when visited can be negotiated more easily thereby. For Leroi-Gourhan, they are male symbols in binary relation to the cave itself, which represents the female principle (discussed below). * Claviform signs: The signs called 'claviform' (key-shaped) are fairly abundant, specially in gallery B and in Room XI, but are doubtful if not indeed non-existent in Gallery A. Those of Room XI are the most characteristic and may be associated with horses. One of these can be considered as what Leroi-Gourhan calls a 'coupled sign', made by uniting in the same ideomorph a line or bar (masculine) with a key-shape (feminine). The typology and chronology of these signs is very ample. Image:La Pasiega-Galeria B-panel 58.pngClaviform symbols Image:La Pasiega- Galeria C-panel 81.pngCoupled claviforms Image:La Pasiega-Galeria C-panel 74b.pngTriangular sign Image:La Pasiega-Galeria C-panel 74a.pngPolygonal signs * Polygonal signs are a varied group, a general category which includes rectangular, pentagonal and hexagonal signs. There is one in every room and, although they are few, one can draw comparisons with examples in other caves. for example there is a grill-shaped sign in Gallery B which can be compared with others in the cave of Aguas de Novales and of Marsoulas. In Gallery A there is a rectangular sign comparable to one which is found in one of the recesses at Lascaux. Lastly there is a sign formed by a pentagon and a hexagon side by side which, in the opinion of the specialist Pilar Casado, should be classified as a variant of the oval signs.Casado L√≥pez, Pilar (1977), Los signos en el arte paleol√≠tico de la pen√≠nsula Ib√©rica, Monograf√≠as Arqueol√≥gicas (Saragossa), pp. 90 and 242. * Tectiform signs: These are without any question the most abundant signs of this cave. They have a more or less rectangular shape, with and without additions, with and without internal divisions. Despite their frequency, these signs are absent from Gallery B. Breuil established a chronology and development through all of them; according to Leroi-Gourhan they belong to Style III and they have parallels in many caves of Spain and France, the nearest being the cave of El Castillo. At La Pasiega they are found in the end area and the narrow defile of Gallery A, and in the first large group of Room XI. Tectiform signs in Gallery A * Unique signs: \\"La Trampa\\" * La Trampa: Mentioning this strange pictorial group in his description of Gallery C, Breuil was the first to appreciate that really it is the result of painting a symbol like a rectangular black tectiform sign, of very evolved type, superimposed upon two older red figures. Leroi-Gourhan accepted that it was the result of combining paintings of different dates, but did not think it should be thought of as a developed tectiform sign: but he thought that the repainting was intentional and concerned the effect of enclosing the animals (the hind-quarters of a bison and the fore-parts, the head and forelegs of a deer) within the ideomorph; he included it all within Style III and interpreted it as a mithogram resulting from the combination of three symbols of femininity. Jord√° Cerd√° and Casado L√≥pez do not admit of a female symbology in 'La Trampa', which they relate, rather, to other representations of sealed enclosures which occur in Las Chimeneas and La Pileta.Jord√° Cerd√°, Francisco, 'Los estilos en el arte parietal magdaleniense cant√°brico,' in Curso de Arte rupestre paleol√≠tico, (Publicaciones de la UIMP, Santander-Zaragoza, 1978), p.73; Casado L√≥pez, Pilar (1977), Los signos en el arte paleol√≠tico de la pen√≠nsula Ib√©rica, Monograf√≠as Arqueol√≥gicas (Saragossa), p.269. * The 'Inscription' of Gallery B is even more complex and unique than these signs; such that Breuil interpreted it as an authentic inscription which contained a coded message for initiates. Leroi-Gourhan goes to some lengths to explain that, being deconstructed, the figure is composed of feminine symbols. Jord√° sees in it a typical sign in the form of a 'sack' related to the sealed enclosures mentioned before, and to serpentine forms which appear at the end of its Middle Cycle. Casado L√≥pez finds parallels at Marsoulas and Font de Gaume. Amelkin proposes a way to read the inscription using the symbols of the Australian Aborigines as well as the Proto- Afroasiatic pictograms.Alexander A. Amelkin, Dr (2019): The Inscription of La Pasiega. - ‚ÄúHieroglyph‚Äù, 08.01.2019 The so-called 'Inscription of La Pasiega' * Human representations: This includes human images, more or less realistic, whether of a part or of the whole human anatomy. The foremost of the partial representations is the vulva: there can be identified three of oval, another rectangular and one triangular, very near 'La Trampa'. Also in this group are the hands which are painted in different ways in la Pasiega: one of these is schematic, which is called a maniform, related, as said above, to those of Santian. There is also a red hand in positive (with six fingers and in relation to a rectangular grill sign). Finally there is another positive hand, but in black, with continuing lines which may be meant to represent an arm. After this come the presumed complete human representations or anthropomorphs. * The anthropomorphs can be counted as three (four if we count the lines which seem to complete the black hand already mentioned), and all of them are very debatable. The most doubtful of all is in Gallery A, which could be a female representation associated with fragmentary animals which are difficult to identify. Also debatable is another, that is executed in red tinta plana, with a globular form, located in Room XI. Very near is the one anthropomorph accepted as such by all investigators, namely a figure in varied colors: the body is outlined in red, with a large mouth; by contrast the skin is black, and there are added some horns, also black (in the opinion of the specialists these are re-paintings of different dates): lower down the figure has a linear ideomorph in yellow ochre which Breuil interpreted as a phallus. In relation to this human shape there are two external red symbols. Image:La Pasiega- Galeria C-panel 74c.pngVulva Image:La Pasiega-Galeria A-panel 11.pngHand- shaped symbol Image:La Pasiega-Galeria B-panel 54.pngHand impression and ideomorph Image:La Pasiega-Galeria C-panel 77.pngAnthropomorph Attempts of chronology The cave of La Pasiega offers many examples of overpaintings and repaintings, which allow attempts of a relative chronology: on the other hand, the great variety of techniques and colors employed make one think of a fairly extensive chronological sequence. The authors of the 1913 monograph ended by establishing three chronological phases which span practically the whole development of palaeolithic art: two Aurignacian phases, a Solutrean and a peak of two-color work (very rare in such paintings), which could be MagdalenianBreuil, H., Obermaier, H., and Alcalde Del R√≠o, H., (1913), La Pasiega √† Puente viesgo, Ed. A. Ch√™ne (M√≥naco). Later Henri Breuil, one of the authors of the monograph, increased the decorative phases to eleven, within the same chronological framework.Breuil, Henri (1952), Quatre cents si√®cles d'Art pari√©tal, Re-ed. Max Fourny (Par√≠s). In 1968 came the analysis of Leroi- gourhan,Leroi-Gourhan, Andr√© (), Prehistoria del arte occidental, Editorial Gustavo Gili, (S.A, Barcelona). . who proposed a rather general chronology, which broadly was in agreement with Gonz√°lez Echegaray.Gonz√°lez Echegaray, Joaqu√≠n, 'Cuevas con arte rupestre en la regi√≥n Cant√°bric', in Curso de Arte rupestre paelol√≠tico (Publicaciones de la UIMP, Santander-Zaragoza, 1978). In both publications the decorations of the entire Gallery A and the first sub- sanctuary of Room XI are placed at the very start of Style III; whereas the second sub-sanctuary of the same room should be placed within the earliest Style IV. Leroi-Gourhan argued from the basis of comparing the works of Gallery A with Lascaux, although recognising that that is more archaic, suggested that they were contemporaneous. Recently, as a result of being able to apply absolute systems of dating to the paintings, it has been demonstrated that the style-classification proposed by Leroi-Gourhan, and some relative dating of other investigators, is shaky.Chauvet and Niaux also were included within Style III, but the absolute chronology relocates them in the Gravettian (25000 years B.P.), see Clottes, J. (1995): 'Les peintures de la Grotte Chauvet Pont d¬¥Arc, √° Vallon Pont d¬¥Arc (Ard√®che, France): datations directes et indirectes par la methode du radiocarbone', in Comptes-Rendus de la Acad√©mie des Sciences de Paris, vol. 320, N¬∫ serie II¬™. Paris, pp. 1113-1140: also Lorbanchet, M. (1995), Les Grottes orn√©es de la Prehistoire; nouveaux regards, Ed. Errance, Paris. The opposite seems to happen in the cave of Las Chimeneas, near La Pasiega, which was grouped with it for stylistic reasons('The animals which accompany them are perfectly of Style III', Leroi Gourhan, French version of 1965, p. 269), but, since then, radiocarbon datings have made them much younger, in the Magdalenian. Jord√° took on the task of revising the chronology of La Pasiega.Jord√° Cerd√°, Francisco, 'Los estilos en el arte parietal magdaleniense cant√°brico', en Curso de Arte rupestre paleol√≠tico Publicaciones de la UIMP, Santander-Zaragoza, 1978. His last publications place the decoration of this cave in his \\"Middle Cycle: Solutrean-Magdalenian\\", accepting integrally the eleven phases of Breuil, but without allowing (or at least seriously doubting) that any part of the decoration could really be Aurignacian. In the Solutrean phase of the Middle Cycle he includes the figures painted in red, and those with fine lines or outlines; also some of the figures in the tampanado method. The engravings of this period would be, according to Jord√°, rare and crude. A little later come the incomplete red horses, but in a lively and realistic style, some of the ideomorphs and the so-called inscription. During the second part of his Middle Cycle, he says, of the Cantabrian Lower Magdalenian, the archaizing engraved contours continue, but there also appears the multiple and striated line drawing in the horses of Galleries B and C, and in the hinds of Gallery C. The painted figures can be red, with tamponado, outline or modelled line. But more important are the tinta plana red paintings treated with modelled chiaroscuro, sometimes associated with graved or black lines which complete them: These are the ones which express dynamism most of all (twisting of the neck, movement of the legs, etc.). For some authors, these figures are the most evolved. The bi- chromes are rare, and in the majority of cases we are dealing with later corrections in a different color to the original painting. Only a horse from gallery A, in the final group, could be considered an authentic bichrome, comparable to those of El Castillo. The most abundant ideomorphs are the quadrangular ones with internal divisions. Jord√° maintains that, during the Middle Cycle, the anthropomorphs disappear, even though La Pasiega contains a few: according to the oldest authors four, and according to the most recent only one.

ISSN 1131-6993. In fact, pretty much all of Gallery A and the first assemblage of Gallery C (room XI) belongs to Style III, in which predominates the red painting with simple lines or lined tamponados, also including the block colors and the addition of engraving or the bi-chrome work as a complement to model the volumes. For its part Style IV is present above all in Gallery B and in the second group of Gallery C: this phase has mainly the black color or drawn with a fine linear outlining, almost without modeling, but with an internal filling of scratches. The engraved forms are most abundant (simple linear marks, or repeated or striated lines, including scraffito).

It was originally thought to be a member of the Dorado Group, however, this membership was later rejected. NGC 1672 has a large bar which is estimated to measure around 20 kpc. It has very strong radio emissions emanating from its nucleus, bar, and the inner portion of the spiral arm region. The nucleus is Seyfert type 2 and is engulfed by a starburst region. The strongest polarized emissions come from the northeastern region which is upstream from its dust lanes. Magnetic field lines are at large angles with respect to the bar and turn smoothly to the center. General structure The center of the galaxy contains a high surface brightness bar, and four filament-like spiral arms extend outward from the ends of this bar. The spiral arms are asymmetric; one of the arms in the northeast part of the disk is significantly brighter than its counterpart on the other side. The spiral arms also contain numerous star formation regions, some of which may be as large as 4‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. Nucleus The classification of the nucleus of NGC 1672 is uncertain. Most galaxies may be classified by their spectra as having one of three different types of nuclei: *A nuclear HII region, a region which has a spectrum similar to that of star formation regions in the Milky Way and which therefore is associated with nuclear star formation activity. *A Seyfert nucleus, a type of active galactic nucleus (AGN) that may contain a supermassive black hole. *A low ionization nuclear emission-line region, a type of nuclear region with spectral line emission from weakly ionized gas that could contain either a star formation region or a supermassive black hole. NGC 1672, however, is one of several nearby galaxies that does not fit into this classification scheme, as its spectrum appears intermediary between these three classes of objects. It may in fact contain both nuclear star formation regions and an AGN. In some wave bands (such as in ultraviolet light), the star formation regions are the primary source of emission.

The station carries a news, talk, and sports format. WINC serves Winchester along with Frederick and Clarke counties in Virginia. Launched on June 26, 1941, by Richard Field Lewis, Jr., WINC was Winchester's first radio station. It remained in the hands of the Lewis family until sold to North Carolina-based Centennial Broadcasting in 2007. The station's current format, established in 1996, consists mostly of conservative talk programs and top-of-the-hour news from Fox News Radio. Sports programming from Virginia Tech is also broadcast. Prior formats heard on WINC include middle of the road music, adult contemporary, and classic hits. Several milestones have occurred during the station's 75 years of history. WINC was the station on which country music singer Patsy Cline made her debut in 1948, when Cline asked the leader of a \\"hillbilly band\\" for a chance to perform with them on air. In the late 1950s, the station's chief engineer, Philip Whitney, designed a CONELRAD alarm device for FM stations to warn listeners in the event of an enemy attack during the Cold War. Whitney also created many of the remote control systems used by radio stations. He was awarded for his work by the National Association of Broadcasters in 1970. WINC had difficulty renewing its license in the early 1970s, as it was airing 22 minutes of commercials per hour‚Äîin excess of what the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permitted. The station encountered further trouble in 1988 when a local prosecutor called one of its promotions an \\"illegal cash lottery\\"; a judge disagreed. In that same year, the news department at WINC received an Associated Press Broadcasters Association national award for \\"Best Radio Spot News\\". The entirety of WINC's program schedule began simulcasting on sister-station WZFC on January 31, 2018. History =Pre-broadcast and launch= Richard Field Lewis, Jr. was a graduate of the College of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. He founded Fredericksburg, Virginia-based radio station WFVA in 1939. Before that, he had worked at KFXM in San Bernardino, California, as chief engineer. Lewis filed the initial application for a new station in Winchester, Virginia, with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) during the week of November 10, 1940. He applied to have WINC broadcast on AM 1370 at 250 watts, and the application was approved on February 4, 1941. In early March 1941, the FCC assigned the WINC call sign, derived from the first four letters in Winchester. In June 1941, WINC announced it would join the NBC Blue Network the following month. At 6:57am, on June 26, 1941, WINC began broadcasting for the first time, becoming Winchester's first radio station. Instead of the frequency of AM 1370 applied for, WINC launched on AM 1400. At launch, the station broadcast at 250 watts day and night. Two weeks later, on July 13, Virginia Senator Harry F. Byrd and Governor James Hubert Price attended the dedication of the station. The first announcer on WINC was Grant Pollock, who had been hired as the station's commercial sales manager. Pollock came to Winchester from NBC Radio in Los Angeles. At the time of WINC's launch, Winchester had a population of 12,095, with only 2,968 radios. Throughout the station's existence, WINC's studios have been located at 520 North Pleasant Valley Road in Winchester. The address at launch was 520 Kerr Street, later incorporated into Pleasant Valley Road. =History since launch= World War II Less than six months after the station's first broadcast, WINC carried live descriptions of the attack on Pearl Harbor and President Roosevelt's \\"Infamy Speech\\" the following day. With the United States entry to World War II, WINC participated in the war effort on the air and at its studios. The City of Winchester erected an Aircraft Warning Service station, manned by volunteers, beside the WINC facility. The station aired an hour-long special program called \\"Virginia Schools at War Mobilization\\" on February 22, 1943. The program involved approximately 618,000 schoolchildren and teachers from around the state, war-savings staff, and state and civic dignitaries. The special, broadcast live from Mount Vernon, was carried on 13 other Virginia stations and on WWDC in Washington, D.C. WINC participated in another wartime broadcast, this one in late January 1944, to encourage the public to buy War Bonds. A total of $150,525 in bonds were sold during the two-hour program, broadcast on 13 stations in Virginia and one in Washington, D.C. On June 15, 1945, the NBC Blue Network formally changed its name to the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). WINC remained an affiliate of the renamed network. In the same year, C. Leslie Golliday was hired as the station's production manager. Golliday also built and launched two stations of his own: WEPM in Martinsburg, West Virginia, in 1946 and WCLG in Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1954. Post World War II The station began carrying Standard Oil's \\"Your Esso Weather Reporter\\" spots on April 22, 1946. The Esso programs included the \\"latest weather prediction and [a] brief commercial\\". WINC began carrying programming from the Keystone Broadcasting System (KBS) and Lang‚ÄìWorth Feature Programs in 1946 and 1948 respectively. Both Keystone and Lang-Worth were electrical transcription networks. Programming from Lang- Worth was removed from the station's schedule in 1951, while Keystone programming remained until 1960. Richard F. Lewis, Jr., launched WINC-FM, sister station to WINC, on November 18, 1946. A January 1947 contest on WINC was responsible for knocking out the entire telephone system for the city of Winchester. Mark Sheeler, a disc jockey at WINC, gave a \\"wolf whistle\\" as the signal for Winchester area \\"housewives\\" to call the studio. The first one to reach him would win \\"a free pair of nylon hose and a $10 handbag\\". The station received around 4,000 simultaneous phone calls; the first call to get through was from the telephone company. Sheeler was informed that his contest was jamming local phone lines. He quickly made an on-air announcement calling off the contest. On August 8, 1947, WINC applied to move from 1400 to 950 AM. In the same application, the station requested an increase in the station's power to 1,000 watts during the day and 500 watts at night. More than two years later, the application was dismissed and WINC remained at its original frequency and power. Fourteen-year-old country music singer Virginia \\"Ginny\\" Hensley, who later became Patsy Cline, began her career by making her broadcast debut on WINC in 1948. Hensley asked \\"Joltin'\\" Jim McCoy, the leader of a \\"hillbilly band\\" called \\"The Melody Playboys\\", about to perform on the station, for a chance to sing with them. She told the band leader, \\"If you just give me a chance to sing with you, I'll never ask for pay.\\" Cline continued to perform regularly on Saturday mornings on WINC. In 1948 and 1949, respectively, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope visited WINC, where they were interviewed on-the-air. Crosby and Hope were each in town for the city's annual Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival. In early 1950, Lewis hired Whittaker Chambers. Chambers was an American journalist (who had previously worked at Time Magazine), Communist Party member, and a former Soviet agent. Chambers was a \\"principal figure in the Alger Hiss case\\". WINC joined the NBC Radio Network (previously named NBC Red) on November 1, 1951, after more than ten years as an ABC affiliate (previously called NBC Blue). WINC rejoined ABC Radio, carrying both networks' programming, on January 18, 1952, but dropped NBC programming in 1953. WINC became one of the flagship members of the Washington Senators Baseball Network, established in May 1952. The station added the long-running Voice of Prophecy program on June 3, 1953. On October 18, 1957, WINC owner Richard F. Lewis, Jr., died, and control of WINC passed to his widow, Marion Park Lewis. Ownership of the station was transferred again on January 31, 1964, from Richard F. Lewis Jr., Inc., a company owned by Marion Park Lewis, to Mid-Atlantic Network Inc., a corporation wholly owned by the Lewis family. The station applied for and received a construction permit on August 9, 1958, to increase its broadcasting power from 250 to 1,000 watts, both day and night. The FCC approved the application in January 1961 but only for a daytime power increase. In 1959, WINC engineer Philip Whitney designed a CONELRAD alarm device for FM stations. The CONELRAD system allowed for early nationwide warnings in the event of possible enemy attack during the Cold War. Whitney is also credited with creating many of the remote control systems used by radio stations, including the microwave remote control system. The National Association of Broadcasters presented Whitney with its annual Engineering Award on April 7, 1970, for his work. 1960s through 1980s WINC's studios and transmitting tower, North Pleasant Valley Road, Winchester. In the 1960s, the station hosted interviews with several prominent figures. Paul Harvey, in town for a speaking engagement, broadcast his \\"News and Comment\\" program from WINC studios on April 14, 1962. President Lyndon B. Johnson, visiting for the Apple Blossom Festival in 1964, was interviewed live on the station. The station was the first in Winchester to announce the assassinations of John F. Kennedy in 1963 and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. While attempting to renew the station's license in early 1971, Mid-Atlantic Network ran into trouble with the FCC due to the quantity of commercials the station was airing. The station was carrying 22 minutes of commercials an hour according to a letter from then-FCC Broadcast Bureau Chief Francis R. Welsh. Welsh said in the letter that the FCC was not convinced the amount of commercials served the community in a positive way. At the time, the FCC allowed no more than 18 minutes of commercials per hour. However, the station's license was ultimately renewed on May 14, 1971. Part of WINC's programming in 1977 included daily political commentaries from former California governor Ronald Reagan. WINC remained an ABC Radio affiliate in 1978, carrying its American Contemporary Network with a middle of the road music format. WINC added adult contemporary music to its format in 1980. In 1981, the first year for which ratings information is available, WINC led all other area stations with a 16.3 rating. The station dropped the middle of the road music in 1982, airing only adult contemporary music. In 1985, WINC removed ABC Radio's \\"American Contemporary Network\\" from its schedule in favor of ABC's \\"American Entertainment Network\\", while continuing to air an adult contemporary format. The station increased its nighttime power to 1,000 watts in 1986. The news department at WINC received an Associated Press Broadcasters Association national award for \\"Best Radio Spot News\\" in 1988. =1988 \\"Lottery\\" lawsuit= The local prosecutor, City of Winchester Commonwealth's Attorney Paul Thomson, filed suit against WINC and sister station WINC-FM in June 1988 for a promotion Thomson called an \\"illegal cash lottery\\". A license plate number of a car with a WINC bumper sticker was announced over the air, and the owner was given 92 minutes to call in and choose to accept a prize of $92 or give up the money for a chance of winning $9,200. Thomson compared the contest to the game show Let's Make a Deal. On December 19, 1988, Winchester Circuit Court Judge Perry Sarver ruled in favor of WINC stating he did not believe \\"promotional plans such as was used ... are in violation of the lottery statute\\". Sarver also said it would require a \\"substantial expenditure\\" for the contest to be considered a lottery. 1990s and after By 1991, WINC was airing a classic hits format, which was dropped a year later, returning to adult contemporary. Talk programs were added in 1994 and all music dropped two years after that. Also in 1996, WINC became an affiliate of AP Radio. With the change to News/Talk, WINC garnered only a 2.9 in the 1996 radio ratings. In contrast, sister station WINC-FM received a 12.1 during the same ratings period. The station's Internet presence also began in 1996, as a subpage within sister station WINC-FM's website. WINC launched its own website in 2008. In 1998, WINC began using the slogan \\"The Right Side of the AM Dial\\". The station picked up CBS and CNN affiliations in 2000, dropping the Associated Press. WINC's last logo prior to adding the FM simulcast. On October 22, 2007, WINC debuted a live and local morning show called The Winchester Morning Magazine airing weekdays from to The program, hosted by Michael Haman, featured topics ranging from local general interest to news. The program was cancelled under a year later in September 2008, and the station returned to syndicated programming in the mornings. Also in 2008, WINC began using the \\"First in Winchester, First in News\\" slogan. =Sale to present day= On May 17, 2007, Mid-Atlantic Network announced it was selling WINC to North Carolina-based Centennial Broadcasting. The price of the sale, initially reported at $36 million, also included sister stations WINC- FM, WWRT (now WZFC), and WWRE (now WXBN) in Winchester and WBQB and WFVA in Fredericksburg. Later reports had the price of the sale at $35.972 million. Centennial CEO Allen B. Shaw, commenting in a Winchester Star interview on the sale, said he had been considering buying the company for several months. At the time of the interview, he did not foresee any changes to the stations. The sale closed in August 2007, and in the last ratings book under Lewis Family ownership, WINC received a 2.7 rating. The station's ratings have stayed within a two- to three-point range, while the format has remained the same after the sale. WINC celebrated its 75th year on the air on June 26, 2016. The station aired vignettes with former employees and a classic photo album was added on the station's website. Sister-station WZFC began simulcasting WINC on January 31, 2018, extending WINC's programming into Front Royal and Woodstock, as well as parts of Warren and Shenandoah Counties in Virginia. The addition of the FM simulcast was something Operations manager Mike Herald had considered \\"for quite some time\\" but only brought to fruition due to the current political climate. Hearld felt the \\"conservative lean\\" of the hosts aired by WINC would \\"resonate really well with the folks here in the valley\\" as \\"Mr. Trump has made things very exciting\\". The fact that Warren and Shenandoah Counties voted Republican or \\"red\\" by \\"at least a 30-point margin\\" in the 2016 Presidential Election and the 2017 Virginia Gubernatorial Election also made it a \\"natural fit\\". Programming WINC carries a news/talk/sports format established in 1996. The station's weekday schedule starts with the John Trout-hosted America in the Morning newshour followed by Hugh Hewitt. Conservative talk show hosts Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Mark Levin are then broadcast, followed by The Jim Bohannon Show and Coast to Coast AM. WINC carries five-minute newscasts every hour from Fox News Radio. The station also has a news department that prepares and broadcasts local news reports. The station is an affiliate of the Virginia Tech IMG Sports Network, which carries Virginia Tech football and basketball. Weekend programming on WINC includes The Kim Komando Show, home-improvement shows In the Garden with Andre Viette, At Home with Gary Sullivan, and On the House with the Carey Brothers. The station also airs \\"best of\\" editions of previously recorded weekday programming.

The 30th floor of the point blocks were the highest inhabitable floor level of any building in Glasgow. Views from the upper floors drew the eye along the Campsie Fells to Ben Lomond and the Arrochar Alps, then west past the Erskine Bridge and out to Goat Fell on the Isle of Arran continuing south over Glasgow and East towards Edinburgh. On a clear day, the buildings were visible on the Glasgow skyline from up to away. The 31st floor of the point blocks and the corresponding 28th floor of the slabs were reserved as a communal drying area. Among the best-known of Glasgow's highrise housing developments of the 1960s, the buildings were formally condemned in July 2008 after a long period of decline, with their phased demolition taking place in three stages between 2010 and 2015. Construction After the publication of the Bruce Report in 1946, Glasgow Corporation identified Comprehensive Development Areas (CDAs), which were largely inner-urban districts (such as the Gorbals, Anderston and Townhead), with a high proportion of overcrowded slum housing. These areas would see the mass demolition of overcrowded and insanitary tenement slum housing, and their replacement with lower density housing schemes to create space for modern developments. The dispersed population would be relocated to new estates built on green belt land on the outer periphery of the city's metropolitan area, with others moved out to the New Towns of Cumbernauld and East Kilbride. These initiatives began to be implemented in the late 1950s. Barlornock was a green belt area that had undergone little development before the construction of the Red Road estate. The original plan for Red Road was far more modest than the eventual high-rise scheme ‚Äì it called for a complex of maisonettes no taller than 4 storeys. What emerged was Glasgow Corporation architect Sam Bunton's scheme to house a population of 4,700 people in 28- and 31-storey tower blocks which were at the time the highest in Europe, although they were quickly surpassed when Birmingham City Housing Department opened The Sentinels, two 32 storey council blocks in 1971 (these were themselves surpassed by the 42-storey Barbican Estate in the City of London completed in 1973). Criticism Contemporary critics of the scheme accused Bunton ‚Äì who was close to retirement at the time ‚Äì of championing the development as a personal vanity project; he was well known within Glasgow Corporation as a strong proponent of high-rise housing; his practice having designed other similar multi-storey estates around the city. Bunton was said to have dreamt of \\"building a Manhattan-style skyscraper\\" in Glasgow, hence the use of the steel frame construction system in place of the \\"system-built\\" pre-fabricated concrete panel method which had been used for all other tower blocks built in the city up until that point. This would create one of the estate's most significant legacies ‚Äì steel construction had to be fire-proofed, which meant the use of asbestos, a legacy which would blight the estate in the coming years. Bunton argued for the steel frame in numerous letters to the Glasgow Herald in February 1963, claiming \\"it is the best material available in the construction field since it brings into active participation an array of steel erectors, and the resources of an industry which is at present only working at one-third of its capacity\\", thus suggesting that local politics (primarily lobbying from Glasgow's underworked steel fabrication industries) had shaped the design of the buildings in other ways. The first three towers were formally opened on 28 October 1966, by the then Scottish Secretary, Willie Ross. For most of the early residents, living in the flats meant a considerable and welcome rise in their living conditions, since most had previously lived in much worse housing, often severely overcrowded, either nearby or elsewhere in the city. From the time they were built until recent years, they were owned by the local council. =Use of asbestos= During the original construction, large amounts of asbestos were used to ensure the structural integrity of the buildings' steel frames in the event of a fire.Jacobs, J.M.; Cairns, S. and Strebel, I. '‚ÄòA tall storey‚Ä¶but, a fact just the same‚Äô: The Red Road highrise as a black box.', 2006, University of Edinburgh School of Geosciences Despite contemporary concerns over the suitability of the nature of the fire proofing solution used in the buildings, Bunton vehemently defended it, stating in an article to the International Asbestos Cement Review in 1966; \\"steel and asbestos in partnership with social others operate as the collective that stabilises Red Road and holds it together, albeit provisionally, as a viable, safe housing solution\\". Two decades later it became widely known that the use of this material caused illnesses and deaths, and whilst some of it was removed over the course of the life of the buildings ‚Äì between 1979 and 1982 the buildings were fitted with coloured metal overcladding to cover the exterior asbestos walls, whilst the slab blocks had additional external fire escapes built in the late 1980s.Williamson, Elizabeth, et al. The Buildings of Scotland: Glasgow, Penguin Books 1990, p. 477 Asbestos was integral to their structure and could not be fully removed until the buildings were demolished. Decline The two most westerly blocks of the complex; 10 Red Road Court (left) and 33 Petershill Drive (centre), were later used as student accommodation and a YMCA, respectively Red Road Flats, view from Broomfield Road, 2012. By the 1970s the estate had gained a reputation for anti-social crime, ranging from disaffected youths throwing objects from the roofs to frequent burglaries. Such problems were less severe than those evident in parts of the city such as the nearby low-rise Blackhill estate, long dominated by ruthless crime gangs. But they were able to strike a nerve in the perceptions of non-residents, owing partly to the \\"looming\\" ambience of the blocks which in some ways might be called emblematic. The slab blocks, for example, are not only 25 storeys high but also almost 100 metres wide. A major turning point came in August 1977, when a fire started by vandals in an empty flat on the 23rd floor of 10 Red Road Court, caused serious structural damage to the building, resulting in the death of a 12-year-old boy and a large number of tenants being evacuated. Many refused to return to their ruined homes, since the fire had brought to the fore the issues surrounding the asbestos lining used in the buildings, and prompted the outer refurbishment of the towers. As a mark of respect ‚Äì the flat on Floor 23 of 10 Red Road Court was never let out again for rent, and instead was refurbished as a drop-in \\"community flat\\" with social amenities for the whole estate. Around 1980 the authorities declared two of the blocks (10 Red Road Court, and 33 Petershill Drive) unfit as family accommodation and transferred them for use by students and the YMCA respectively. These happened to be the blocks closest to the front of the complex when approached from the city centre. Being nearest the bus stop, they were also easiest to locate for the YMCA guests and college students. Graffiti around the flats By the time the 1980s had dawned, it had become clear that the optimism that had surrounded the policy of high rise housing had waned in less than two decades, and despite attempts to regenerate the estate, drug dealing, muggings and other serious crime continued, and the towers also became a frequent spot for suicides. Along with the equally controversial and derided Hutchesontown C estate in the Gorbals, Red Road became increasingly looked upon as a monument to the errors of Glasgow's ambitious post-war housing renewal policy. Improvements Measures were introduced in the 1980s which gave residents increased protection. These included the control of access through the communal entrance doors by means of RFID keys and intercoms, and the installation of round-the-clock concierge facilities. Crime fell dramatically. Refugees By the 1990s, residents included refugees from the Kosovo War. Later residents included people who had fled from countries in Africa, Asia, and elsewhere in Europe. Transfer to housing association ownership The position changed dramatically in 2003 when the flats were transferred, after a ballot, to a housing association in the shape of the Glasgow Housing Association Ltd. The practice of transferring housing stock from public to private ownership had initially been launched in the 1970s as a flagship policy promoted by the Conservative Party. At that time, the recipients were individual tenants who opted to buy their homes, or long-term leases thereon. Twenty years later the policy was continued by the Labour Party led council, which transferred its entire housing stock to a single company set up for the purpose. Demolition Demolition site at the Red Road flats 153‚Äì213 Petershill Drive (view from west, before demolition) Soon the new landlords as well as the council insisted that repairs were costing more than receipts in rent, and that big changes therefore had to be made. In 2005 Glasgow Housing Association announced its intention to demolish one of the tallest blocks as part of a regeneration of the area. Defend Council Housing, a pro-council housing campaign group, set up a local campaign against the demolition, seeking to ensure the scheme's continued existence. However, all the eight buildings were planned for phased demolition beginning in the spring of 2010 and expected to be accomplished within a decade. On 7 March 2010, the Serykh family, three asylum seekers, jumped to their deaths from one of the towers. These deaths galvanised much in the way of action in and around the Red Road. Various projects now exist to document the end of the flats positively, with the hope that everyone with memories of the flats will contribute actively to the projects as best they can. The first block, the 28-floor slab block, was demolished by controlled explosion on 10 June 2012. The steel structured tower took just six seconds to fall after a series of carefully timed explosions, using of explosive, ripped along the building around the sixth to eighth floors. The second block, the 31-floor point block on Birnie Court was demolished on 5 May 2013, at 11:46 a.m., taking about four seconds to fall. In April 2014, it was announced that five of the remaining towers would be given a dramatic explosive demolition as part of the 2014 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony. The spectacle would have the five towers simultaneously felled by controlled explosion, with the footage being broadcast live to large screens in Celtic Park. Former MSP Carolyn Leckie criticised the demolition plans and called for the five flats to be \\"demolished with dignity, not for entertainment\\". She has said \\"the image of tower blocks coming down is not a positive international spectacle\\" and suggests it also conveys disregard for the asylum seekers living in the sixth tower, which would remain standing. The demolition plan for the Commonwealth Games was cancelled for safety reasons, but the flats were demolished the following year. In August 2015, Glasgow Housing Association announced that all six remaining high-rise blocks would be brought down in a one-off demolition later in 2015. The six remaining towers were demolished on 11 October 2015, after Sheriff Court interdicts (the Scottish law equivalent of an injunction) were obtained against a group of residents who refused to leave their nearby homes during the explosions.http://www.thenational.scot/news/campaigners-vow- to-form-human-shield-in-bid-to-stop-red-road-flats-demolition.8361 Two of the six blocks failed to completely collapse and remained partially standing. The contractors, Safedem, are to carry out a review to determine the best way of completing the demolition. The partial remains of the two flats were eventually demolished using a high reach excavator. In popular culture The towers have often been used as locations by photographers and film makers, and have been the subject of various literary works. As well as making numerous appearances in the STV police drama Taggart, the estate was featured in the 2006 film, Red Road, which won a BAFTA and the Prix de Jury (third prize) at the Cannes film festival. In July 2007, the French high wire artist Didier Pasquette, a protege of Philippe Petit (famous for his high wire walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York), undertook a high wire stunt between two of the Red Road towers, attempting to cross the gap between Towers 4 and 5. Although thwarted by Glasgow's temperamental weather he managed to walk across the chasm, backwards on one occasion. From 19 February to 27 June 2010, the Red Road flats featured in the \\"Multi-Story\\" exhibition at Glasgow's Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA). Multi-story is a collaborative arts project based in the Red Road, established in 2004 by Street Level Photoworks in partnership with The Scottish Refugee Council and the YMCA. On 14 March 2010, The Sunday Times in Scotland featured the recollections of Glasgow born film-maker, Matt Quinn, who grew up in the flats. Glasgow Life, a part of the city authorities, have a project to document the Red Road experience. This features specially commissioned photography, film and even a novel to celebrate life in 'the scheme'. On 15 March 2010 this was updated to include volume 1 of \\"Your Stories\\" which features the recollections of the area by various local people. Alison Irvine published the novel This Road Is Red (2012); a collection of semi-fictional stories based on anecdotes from real- life residents over the 50-year history of the estate. The novel was illustrated by Mitch Miller, who produced a series of 4 dialectograms (large- scale documentary plan drawings) depicting everyday life within the flats.

Its construction began in 1937, with delayed completion until 1948 due to World War II shortages in labor and materials. A portion of the canal's right of way has been developed as the Contra Costa Canal Regional Trail, a biking and walking trail, and is managed by the East Bay Regional Park District.  Canal uses  The Contra Costa Canal is used for agricultural, industrial, and municipal water purposes. Due to the water used for water supply for different cities, the canal is fenced off from the public. The canal provides water for the largest urban contractor of the Central Valley Project, the Contra Costa Water District. It is part of the Central Valley Project managed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation to divert Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta water from Rock Slough as far as Martinez, California in Central Contra Costa County.  Canal management  = Contra Costa Water District = Distributes water from the canal to: * Antioch * Bay Point * Clyde * Concord * Knightsen * Martinez * Oakley * Pacheco * Pittsburg * Pleasant Hill * Walnut Creek = Los Vaqueros Reservoir = Fish Screen at Contra Costa Canal Los Vaqueros Reservoir is an off-stream water storage passed in 1988 by voters to store water from the canal for purposes to improve water quality. = Contra Loma Reservoir = A 2,000 acre-foot reservoir built in Antioch as an emergency supply for Contra Costa Canal. = East Bay Regional Park District = = Inline canal water screens = An inline canal water screen was installed to remove debris including moss, grass, hyacinth, and tumbleweeds.  Social impact  A three-day water arrival celebration from Contra Costa Canal to the City of Pittsburg was held in 1940. Per the Canal's link to the city, Pittsburg became desirable due to its drinkable water, resulting in building of homes and increasing population in the area. Local citizens were satisfied with the new arrangement because of the increase of water quality that exceeded their local water reserves.  Public concerns  = Accidents and prevention = Eight people have drowned since 2000, causes ranging from trespassing to car accidents. Many people drown due to falling into the canal and having trouble getting out because the canal has a steep build and the sides are slippery. The water current reaches up to 12 mph, and can take people through areas of 6‚Äì8 feet of depth, and 18 feet wide. Ways to stop trespassing and reduce deaths in the canal include putting up chain link fences around the canal, placement of warning signs, childhood education, pamphlet distribution, phone numbers to report people, and handing out fines from $25-$500. However, people still jump or cut fences to get into canal for all different kinds of activities. = Safety education = The Contra Costa Water District has created and uploaded a video on YouTube and on their site named ‚ÄúStaying Safe Along the Contra Costa Canal‚Äù for public viewing. Safety drills are held to train canal workers in rescuing people from the canal in case of an emergency. There are also canal patrol officers. = Recreation =  Contra Costa Canal Trail  The trail runs along the Contra Costa Canal through central Costa County, connecting regional trails. It connects schools, commercial areas, and public transportation. It was created by Contra Costa Water District, Bureau of Reclamation and the Park District. It is publicly accessible by bikers, runners, pedestrians, and equestrians.  Wildlife  Fish, crawdads, geese, ducks, egrets, muskrats, beavers, otters, and wild pigs have been spotted in the canal.

For example, the Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian gives the eventual distribution of heat in a room several hours after the heating is turned on. Differential equations describe a large class of natural phenomena, from the heat equation describing the evolution of heat in (for instance) a metal plate, to the Navier-Stokes equation describing the movement of fluids, including Einstein's equations describing the physical universe in a relativistic way. Although all these equations are boundary value problems, they are further subdivided into categories. This is necessary because each category must be analyzed using different techniques. The present article deals with the category of boundary value problems known as linear elliptic problems. Boundary value problems and partial differential equations specify relations between two or more quantities. For instance, in the heat equation, the rate of change of temperature at a point is related to the difference of temperature between that point and the nearby points so that, over time, the heat flows from hotter points to cooler points. Boundary value problems can involve space, time and other quantities such as temperature, velocity, pressure, magnetic field, etc... Some problems do not involve time. For instance, if one hangs a clothesline between the house and a tree, then in the absence of wind, the clothesline will not move and will adopt a gentle hanging curved shape known as the catenary.Swetz, Faauvel, Bekken, \\"Learn from the Masters\\", 1997, MAA , pp.128-9 This curved shape can be computed as the solution of a differential equation relating position, tension, angle and gravity, but since the shape does not change over time, there is no time variable. Elliptic boundary value problems are a class of problems which do not involve the time variable, and instead only depend on space variables.  The main example  In two dimensions, let x,y be the coordinates. We will use the notation u_x, u_{xx} for the first and second partial derivatives of u with respect to x, and a similar notation for y. We will use the symbols D_x and D_y for the partial differential operators in x and y. The second partial derivatives will be denoted D_x^2 and D_y^2. We also define the gradient abla u = (u_x,u_y), the Laplace operator \\\\Delta u = u_{xx}+u_{yy} and the divergence abla \\\\cdot (u,v) = u_x + v_y. Note from the definitions that \\\\Delta u = abla \\\\cdot ( abla u). The main example for boundary value problems is the Laplace operator, :\\\\Delta u = f \\\\text{ in }\\\\Omega, :u = 0 \\\\text { on }\\\\partial \\\\Omega; where \\\\Omega is a region in the plane and \\\\partial \\\\Omega is the boundary of that region. The function f is known data and the solution u is what must be computed. This example has the same essential properties as all other elliptic boundary value problems. The solution u can be interpreted as the stationary or limit distribution of heat in a metal plate shaped like \\\\Omega, if this metal plate has its boundary adjacent to ice (which is kept at zero degrees, thus the Dirichlet boundary condition.) The function f represents the intensity of heat generation at each point in the plate (perhaps there is an electric heater resting on the metal plate, pumping heat into the plate at rate f(x), which does not vary over time, but may be nonuniform in space on the metal plate.) After waiting for a long time, the temperature distribution in the metal plate will approach u. = Nomenclature = Let Lu=a u_{xx} + b u_{yy} where a and b are constants. L=aD_x^2+bD_y^2 is called a second order differential operator. If we formally replace the derivatives D_x by x and D_y by y, we obtain the expression :a x^2 + b y^2. If we set this expression equal to some constant k, then we obtain either an ellipse (if a,b,k are all the same sign) or a hyperbola (if a and b are of opposite signs.) For that reason, L is said to be elliptic when ab>0 and hyperbolic if ab<0. Similarly, the operator L=D_x+D_y^2 leads to a parabola, and so this L is said to be parabolic. We now generalize the notion of ellipticity. While it may not be obvious that our generalization is the right one, it turns out that it does preserve most of the necessary properties for the purpose of analysis. = General linear elliptic boundary value problems of the second degree = Let x_1,...,x_n be the space variables. Let a_{ij}(x), b_i(x), c(x) be real valued functions of x=(x_1,...,x_n). Let L be a second degree linear operator. That is, :Lu(x)=\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^n (a_{ij} (x) u_{x_i})_{x_j} + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i(x) u_{x_i}(x) + c(x) u(x) (divergence form). :Lu(x)=\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij} (x) u_{x_i x_j} + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\tilde b_i(x) u_{x_i}(x) + c(x) u(x) (nondivergence form) We have used the subscript \\\\cdot_{x_i} to denote the partial derivative with respect to the space variable x_i. The two formulae are equivalent, provided that :\\\\tilde b_i(x) = b_i(x) + \\\\sum_j a_{ij,x_j}(x). In matrix notation, we can let a(x) be an n \\\\times n matrix valued function of x and b(x) be a n-dimensional column vector-valued function of x, and then we may write :Lu = abla \\\\cdot (a abla u) + b^T abla u + c u (divergence form). One may assume, without loss of generality, that the matrix a is symmetric (that is, for all i,j,x, a_{ij}(x)=a_{ji}(x). We make that assumption in the rest of this article. We say that the operator L is elliptic if, for some constant \\\\alpha>0, any of the following equivalent conditions hold: # \\\\lambda_{\\\\min} (a(x)) > \\\\alpha \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall x (see eigenvalue). # u^T a(x) u > \\\\alpha u^T u \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. # \\\\sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij} u_i u_j > \\\\alpha \\\\sum_{i=1}^n u_i^2 \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\forall u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. An elliptic boundary value problem is then a system of equations like :Lu=f \\\\text{ in } \\\\Omega (the PDE) and :u=0 \\\\text{ on } \\\\partial \\\\Omega (the boundary value). This particular example is the Dirichlet problem. The Neumann problem is :Lu=f \\\\text{ in } \\\\Omega and :u_ u = g \\\\text{ on } \\\\partial \\\\Omega where u_ u is the derivative of u in the direction of the outwards pointing normal of \\\\partial \\\\Omega. In general, if B is any trace operator, one can construct the boundary value problem :Lu=f \\\\text{ in } \\\\Omega and :Bu=g \\\\text{ on } \\\\partial \\\\Omega. In the rest of this article, we assume that L is elliptic and that the boundary condition is the Dirichlet condition u=0 \\\\text{ on }\\\\partial \\\\Omega.  Sobolev spaces  The analysis of elliptic boundary value problems requires some fairly sophisticated tools of functional analysis. We require the space H^1(\\\\Omega), the Sobolev space of \\"once-differentiable\\" functions on \\\\Omega, such that both the function u and its partial derivatives u_{x_i}, i=1,\\\\dots,n are all square integrable. There is a subtlety here in that the partial derivatives must be defined \\"in the weak sense\\" (see the article on Sobolev spaces for details.) The space H^1 is a Hilbert space, which accounts for much of the ease with which these problems are analyzed. The discussion in details of Sobolev spaces is beyond the scope of this article, but we will quote required results as they arise. Unless otherwise noted, all derivatives in this article are to be interpreted in the weak, Sobolev sense. We use the term \\"strong derivative\\" to refer to the classical derivative of calculus. We also specify that the spaces C^k, k=0,1,\\\\dots consist of functions that are k times strongly differentiable, and that the kth derivative is continuous.  Weak or variational formulation  The first step to cast the boundary value problem as in the language of Sobolev spaces is to rephrase it in its weak form. Consider the Laplace problem \\\\Delta u = f. Multiply each side of the equation by a \\"test function\\" \\\\varphi and integrate by parts using Green's theorem to obtain :-\\\\int_\\\\Omega abla u \\\\cdot abla \\\\varphi + \\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} u_ u \\\\varphi = \\\\int_\\\\Omega f \\\\varphi. We will be solving the Dirichlet problem, so that u=0\\\\text{ on }\\\\partial \\\\Omega. For technical reasons, it is useful to assume that \\\\varphi is taken from the same space of functions as u is so we also assume that \\\\varphi=0\\\\text{ on }\\\\partial \\\\Omega. This gets rid of the \\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega} term, yielding :A(u,\\\\varphi) = F(\\\\varphi) (*) where :A(u,\\\\varphi) = \\\\int_\\\\Omega abla u \\\\cdot abla \\\\varphi and :F(\\\\varphi) = -\\\\int_\\\\Omega f \\\\varphi. If L is a general elliptic operator, the same reasoning leads to the bilinear form :A(u,\\\\varphi) = \\\\int_\\\\Omega abla u ^T a abla \\\\varphi - \\\\int_\\\\Omega b^T abla u \\\\varphi - \\\\int_\\\\Omega c u \\\\varphi. We do not discuss the Neumann problem but note that it is analyzed in a similar way. = Continuous and coercive bilinear forms = The map A(u,\\\\varphi) is defined on the Sobolev space H^1_0\\\\subset H^1 of functions which are once differentiable and zero on the boundary \\\\partial \\\\Omega, provided we impose some conditions on a,b,c and \\\\Omega. There are many possible choices, but for the purpose of this article, we will assume that # a_{ij}(x) is continuously differentiable on \\\\bar\\\\Omega for i,j=1,\\\\dots,n, # b_i(x) is continuous on \\\\bar\\\\Omega for i=1,\\\\dots,n, # c(x) is continuous on \\\\bar\\\\Omega and # \\\\Omega is bounded. The reader may verify that the map A(u,\\\\varphi) is furthermore bilinear and continuous, and that the map F(\\\\varphi) is linear in \\\\varphi, and continuous if (for instance) f is square integrable. We say that the map A is coercive if there is an \\\\alpha>0 for all u,\\\\varphi \\\\in H_0^1(\\\\Omega), :A(u,\\\\varphi) \\\\geq \\\\alpha \\\\int_\\\\Omega abla u \\\\cdot abla \\\\varphi. This is trivially true for the Laplacian (with \\\\alpha=1) and is also true for an elliptic operator if we assume b = 0 and c \\\\leq 0. (Recall that u^T a u > \\\\alpha u^T u when L is elliptic.) = Existence and uniqueness of the weak solution = One may show, via the Lax‚ÄìMilgram lemma, that whenever A(u,\\\\varphi) is coercive and F(\\\\varphi) is continuous, then there exists a unique solution u\\\\in H_0^1(\\\\Omega) to the weak problem (*). If further A(u,\\\\varphi) is symmetric (i.e., b=0), one can show the same result using the Riesz representation theorem instead. This relies on the fact that A(u,\\\\varphi) forms an inner product on H_0^1(\\\\Omega), which itself depends on Poincar√©'s inequality.  Strong solutions  We have shown that there is a u\\\\in H_0^1(\\\\Omega) which solves the weak system, but we do not know if this u solves the strong system :Lu=f\\\\text{ in }\\\\Omega, :u=0\\\\text{ on }\\\\partial \\\\Omega, Even more vexing is that we are not even sure that u is twice differentiable, rendering the expressions u_{x_i x_j} in Lu apparently meaningless. There are many ways to remedy the situation, the main one being regularity. = Regularity = A regularity theorem for a linear elliptic boundary value problem of the second order takes the form Theorem If (some condition), then the solution u is in H^2(\\\\Omega), the space of \\"twice differentiable\\" functions whose second derivatives are square integrable. There is no known simple condition necessary and sufficient for the conclusion of the theorem to hold, but the following conditions are known to be sufficient: # The boundary of \\\\Omega is C^2, or # \\\\Omega is convex. It may be tempting to infer that if \\\\partial \\\\Omega is piecewise C^2 then u is indeed in H^2, but that is unfortunately false. = Almost everywhere solutions = In the case that u \\\\in H^2(\\\\Omega) then the second derivatives of u are defined almost everywhere, and in that case Lu=f almost everywhere. = Strong solutions = One may further prove that if the boundary of \\\\Omega \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^n is a smooth manifold and f is infinitely differentiable in the strong sense, then u is also infinitely differentiable in the strong sense. In this case, Lu=f with the strong definition of the derivative. The proof of this relies upon an improved regularity theorem that says that if \\\\partial \\\\Omega is C^k and f \\\\in H^{k-2}(\\\\Omega), k\\\\geq 2, then u\\\\in H^k(\\\\Omega), together with a Sobolev imbedding theorem saying that functions in H^k(\\\\Omega) are also in C^m(\\\\bar \\\\Omega) whenever 0 \\\\leq m < k-n/2.  Numerical solutions  While in exceptional circumstances, it is possible to solve elliptic problems explicitly, in general it is an impossible task. The natural solution is to approximate the elliptic problem with a simpler one and to solve this simpler problem on a computer. Because of the good properties we have enumerated (as well as many we have not), there are extremely efficient numerical solvers for linear elliptic boundary value problems (see finite element method, finite difference method and spectral method for examples.)  Eigenvalues and eigensolutions  Another Sobolev imbedding theorem states that the inclusion H^1\\\\subset L^2 is a compact linear map. Equipped with the spectral theorem for compact linear operators, one obtains the following result. Theorem Assume that A(u,\\\\varphi) is coercive, continuous and symmetric. The map S : f \\\\rightarrow u from L^2(\\\\Omega) to L^2(\\\\Omega) is a compact linear map. It has a basis of eigenvectors u_1, u_2, \\\\dots \\\\in H^1(\\\\Omega) and matching eigenvalues \\\\lambda_1,\\\\lambda_2,\\\\dots \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} such that # Su_k = \\\\lambda_k u_k, k=1,2,\\\\dots, # \\\\lambda_k \\\\rightarrow 0 as k \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty, # \\\\lambda_k \\\\gneqq 0\\\\;\\\\;\\\\forall k, # \\\\int_\\\\Omega u_j u_k = 0 whenever j eq k and # \\\\int_\\\\Omega u_j u_j = 1 for all j=1,2,\\\\dots\\\\,. = Series solutions and the importance of eigensolutions = If one has computed the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then one may find the \\"explicit\\" solution of Lu=f, :u=\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\hat u(k) u_k via the formula :\\\\hat u(k) = \\\\lambda_k \\\\hat f(k) ,\\\\;\\\\;k=1,2,\\\\dots where :\\\\hat f(k) = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} f(x) u_k(x) \\\\, dx. (See Fourier series.) The series converges in L^2. Implemented on a computer using numerical approximations, this is known as the spectral method. = An example = Consider the problem :u-u_{xx}-u_{yy}=f(x,y)=xy on (0,1)\\\\times(0,1), :u(x,0)=u(x,1)=u(0,y)=u(1,y)=0 \\\\;\\\\;\\\\forall (x,y)\\\\in(0,1)\\\\times(0,1) (Dirichlet conditions). The reader may verify that the eigenvectors are exactly :u_{jk}(x,y)=\\\\sin(\\\\pi jx)\\\\sin(\\\\pi ky), j,k\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} with eigenvalues :\\\\lambda_{jk}={ 1 \\\\over 1+\\\\pi^2 j^2+\\\\pi^2 k^2 }. The Fourier coefficients of g(x)=x can be looked up in a table, getting \\\\hat g(n) = { (-1)^{n+1} \\\\over \\\\pi n }. Therefore, :\\\\hat f(j,k) = { (-1)^{j+k+1} \\\\over \\\\pi^2 jk } yielding the solution :u(x,y) = \\\\sum_{j,k=1}^\\\\infty { (-1)^{j+k+1} \\\\over \\\\pi^2 jk (1+\\\\pi^2 j^2+\\\\pi^2 k^2) } \\\\sin(\\\\pi jx) \\\\sin (\\\\pi ky).  Maximum principle  There are many variants of the maximum principle. We give a simple one. Theorem. (Weak maximum principle.) Let u \\\\in C^2(\\\\Omega) \\\\cap C^1(\\\\bar \\\\Omega), and assume that c(x)=0\\\\;\\\\forall x\\\\in\\\\Omega. Say that Lu \\\\leq 0 in \\\\Omega. Then \\\\max_{x \\\\in \\\\bar \\\\Omega} u(x) = \\\\max_{x \\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega} u(x). In other words, the maximum is attained on the boundary. A strong maximum principle would conclude that u(x) \\\\lneqq \\\\max_{y \\\\in \\\\partial \\\\Omega} u(y) for all x \\\\in \\\\Omega unless u is constant.

The first Supreme Court of the North-West Territories was created in 1885. At that time, the North-West Territories included the territory which later became the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, as well as the Yukon Territory. The first Supreme Court lasted until abolished for territorial purposes in 1905. However, it continued to act for the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta until finally being abolished in 1907. The current Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories was created in 1955 and continues to operate today. Both courts had general jurisdiction over matters of both civil and criminal law. The first Court was both the trial court and the appellate court, but the current Court is primarily a trial court, with appeals going to the Alberta Court of Appeal, sitting as the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories.  The First Supreme Court (1885-1907)  = Creation of the Court = Regina Courthouse of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, 2002 Victoria Avenue, c.1919. The first Supreme Court of the North-West Territories was created by the federal Parliament in 1885 to replace the system of individual stipendiary magistrates which had previously operated in the Territories.The North-West Territories Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 50. The former stipendiary magistrates were appointed as the first judges of the new Supreme Court. = Jurisdiction and Powers = The Court was a superior court of civil and criminal jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of the Court was defined by reference to the jurisdiction of the English courts which existed as of July 15, 1870, the date the North-West Territories became part of Canada. The Court had all the powers \\"... used, exercised and enjoyed by any of Her Majesty‚Äôs superior courts of common law, or by the Court of Chancery, or by the Court of Probate in England\\" as of that date.The North-West Territories Act, s. 48. The judges of the Court sat individually as trial judges.The North-West Territories Act s. 52. The full court sat en banc to hear appeals.The North-West Territories Act s. 50. A further appeal lay to the Supreme Court of Canada under The Supreme Court Act. The judges of the Supreme Court were initially non-voting members of the Legislative Council of the North-West Territories, to provide legal advice to the Council.The North-West Territories Act, R.S.C. 1885, c. 50. They ceased to have this function when the Legislative Council was converted to a fully elected Legislative Assembly. When the Yukon was created as a separate territory from the North-West Territories in 1898, the Supreme Court continued its jurisdiction over the territory as prescribed by the Yukon Act 1898. = Abolition of the Court = In 1905, Parliament created two new provinces, Alberta and Saskatchewan, from the southern portion of the North-West Territories. Parliament disestablished the Supreme Court in the Territories, and re-established a system of stipendiary magistrates for the North-West TerritoriesThe North-West Territories Amendment Act, 1905, S.C. 1905, c. 27, s. 8. However, as a transitional measure, the federal Acts establishing Alberta and Saskatchewan provided that the Court continued to dispense justice in the new provinces.Alberta Act, S.C. 1905, c. 3, s. 16.Saskatchewan Act, S.C. 1905, c. 42. The Supreme Court lasted for two more years, until the provincial Legislatures created the Supreme Court of Alberta and the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan in 1907. The provincial legislation creating these courts also abolished the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories. Half of the judges of the Supreme Court were appointed to the Supreme Court of Alberta, and the other judges were appointed to the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan. = Judges of the Court= The judges of the Court were appointed by the Governor General, on the advice of the federal Cabinet.The North-West Territories Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 50, s. 42 There were originally three justices of the Court, but by the time of the abolition of the Court, it had grown to six justices: the Chief Justice and five puisne justices.The North-West Territories Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 50, s. 42.

This contrasts with other forms of participatory action research, which emphasize the collective modification of the external world . Praxis potential means the members' potential to reflexively work on their respective mentalities; participant here refers not just to the clientele beneficiaries of the praxis intervention project, but also the organisers and experts participating in such a project. Praxis intervention is intended to lead its members through a \\"participant objectivation\\". The method prioritizes unsettling the settled mentalities, especially where the settled mindsets prevalent in the social world or individuals is suspected to have sustained or contributed to their suffering or marginality .  Reflexive and routine praxis  Praxis was conceptualized in its reflexive and non-reflexive varieties by Karl Marx . The reflexive praxis is the moment in the dialectic change, and the non-reflexive one as the routinising mechanism operating within the ideologies as a reproductive or status quo maintaining. In Marx, it is the non-reflexive habituating praxis, that leads to false consciousness and alienation. Mihailo Markoviƒá explained that moments of praxis include creativity instead of sameness, autonomy instead of subordination, sociality instead of massification, rationality instead of blind reaction and intentionality rather than compliance.  Reasons  Praxis intervention makes research, creative expression or technology development into a bottom-up process. It democratizes making of art, science, technology and critical conscience. The praxis intervention method aims at provoking members to unsettle their settled mindsets and to have a fresh look at the world around and intervene. For instance, members may take a fresh critical look on the gender relations existing, if the praxis intervention method is applied to study gender relations. They would be unsettling their biographically and structurally ingrained perceptions of gender relations and freshly look at it. A gradual process by which members are helped to reflexively recognize the arbitrary and discriminating mindsets within themselves and the world around and working towards correcting it is praxis intervention. The praxis intervention method helps members to struggle against structurally ingrained discrimination. Praxis intervention helps respondents to come out with answers which they would not have otherwise expressed. Questionnaire based surveys, formal interviews, and even focus group discussions are not useful to help respondents to come out with genuine answers to the questions posed at them. Praxis intervention as it helps groups of people probing their own conditions phase by phase through prolonged discussions, experiments and conscious explorations is capable of coming out with better quality data that could be useful for the group to challenge existing epistemic structures and work out their own well being. Praxis intervention is useful wherever reflexivity is a major component in a research project.  Systematic participant objectivation  Praxis intervention interferes not only with the habitus of the people with whom the action research is carried out, but also the praxis intervention practitioner's own habitus. In this respect, the practice of praxis intervention is also a systematic participant objectivation. Participatory objectivation is \\"objectifying the act of objectification\\". By objectifying the objectification it is meant the researcher, while observing and objectifying, takes a similar critical distance towards the objectification itself. It is being sensitive to the immensely possible biases from the researcher‚Äôs social coordinates, field and intellectual orientation and self- critically problematising them to reduce the impact of the biases (; ). According to Bourdieu, within the sociological analysis, the participant objectivation is the essential but difficult exercise of all because it requires the break with the deepest and most conscious adherence and adhesions, those quite often give the object its very interest for those who study it, that is, everything about their relation to the object they try to know that they least want to know . It is through the participant objectivation that the practical relation to practice is substituted with the observer‚Äôs relation to practice . Through the practice of participant objectivation, Bourdieu aims to make the critical and political activity of social research the \\"solvent of doxa\\". Though the practice of reflexive participant objectivation, the practitioner re-looks the taken-for-granted assumptions in order to wake up from their epistemic sleep and helps their clients too to help them to wake up from their own.  In practice  Praxis intervention as a practice involves working on the bias of the professionals and their clientele. It is a practical method of \\"objectifying objectification\\" on a collective basis . The praxis intervention method problematises the bias of the researcher and her clientele emerging from their social origins, class, gender coordinates; their position in the intellectual field and in their respective social space; and also their \\"intellectual bias,\\" the results of viewing the world as a spectacle. In practice it involves the clientele and the researchers collectively probing into a problem that affects the clientele and helping the clientele to find solutions to their problem through reflexive probing with the experts belonging to relevant fields. The project aims at the clientele and the researchers work together and collectively learn from each other. Praxis intervention can be carried out in phased manner. The first phase could involve orienting the clientele (and experts as well) of the problem under focus. The problem under focus could be anything like existing status of marginality, gender relation, health condition or status of present technology etc. Once the problem could properly be oriented from as much angles as possible the clientele, experts and others could involve discussing appropriate method to probe the issue under discussion. They could also decide on the phases through which the collective probing to be undertaken. The second phase could be clientele exploring the issue themselves through the methods collectively agreed. They could maintain a journal to record their experiences and reflexive probing. The third phase could be the clientele coming together with experts and sharing their experience with their fellow clients and experts. After discussing all the observations and experiences the method of enquiry can be further fine-tuned for better understanding. Gradually the clientele could be guided to intervene on the issue concerned and document their experience. Their action and reflexion could be discussed and fine tuned for further interventions. The phases and intervention strategies could be decided as it could be appropriate for different problems. Praxis intervention method focuses on what happens to mindsets. In the community work situation it could be a project helping the community participants to undertake a systematic research on themselves in the areas such as history of their social relationships, land ownership patterns, critically exploring gender relations, studying the ecological changes happening in their habitat, learning historically and comparatively on their health status, nutrition status etc. The research undertook by the local residents can be converted into social actions or welfare projects. The practice of praxis intervention can be used in many fields such as post positivist research, social work research, participatory action research, local history research, social action and social work projects, clinical health research, community health research projects, participatory technology development projects, and many other projects where people's participation and their critical reflexivity is crucial. = In education = The method can be used in the field of education. Educational process can be re constituted in accordance to the learning capabilities of the sets of students. Students going under the process of praxis intervention would listen to the expert opinions and explanations of the phenomenon under discussion and they would carry out experiments in the laboratory or in appropriate practical field relevant to the phenomenon under focus individually, collectively and collaboratively as they are guided by the expert teachers. They would bring back the results of experiments to the classroom setting and clarify with each other and also with the expert teachers. In this process syllabus can be indicative negotiable taking into consideration of the advancement of knowledge creation. In this process knowledge becomes creative appropriation rather than indoctrination. This may help students to gain great quantity of quality knowledge within short periods of time. The method could be effectively used in pre-primary to Higher schools of education. The method could be used in development of professional skills such as engineering, medicine, nursing, law, agricultural science, social work, management, career guidance, expertise development, teaching and other such fields. For instance, students of various technology oriented courses can be guided to develop and enhance technology by going under a praxis intervention experiment with users, experts and other relevant stakeholders. This could be appropriate for development and promotion of free software. = In healthcare = Similarly praxis intervention can be used in helping patients to undergo a participatory diagnostic and experience sharing research with the medical professionals and other experts on their health conditions and take necessary action. Group of Patients suffering from similar diseases, their family members, and their significant others, medical practitioners and relevant experts can sit together and be guided through informed dialogue, systematic corrective measures, and experience sharing. In this process both the facilitating professionals and the patients can overcome their respective personal and professional bias. = In social work = The praxis intervention method could be extended to the professional social work practice in facilitating the social workers themselves and their clients overcoming personal or social mindsets that induce suffering or marginality. The praxis mode of social work depends on the sensibility that could be provoked in a given context: sensible towards one‚Äôs own biography, historical locatedness, spatial positioning and the interaction setting. The praxis intervention practice has its implications for social work education. A social work education based on praxis model could shape the students and teachers self-reflexive, sensible. Through this method, it may be possible for students gaining theoretical and practical skills. The method can be used in other branches of education and training like the management education, medical education, agriculture extension and other fields where the clientele really matter. However, the praxis model would be yielding better results if sufficient flexibility is maintained. It could be a model for providing companionship to people in need of self-exploration. Praxis intervention as a practice can be carried on to the extent it is possible for people to take care of themselves and to the extent people require professional companionship of the social work practice. Praxis intervention practice requires the professionals and the client participants to be self-reflexive and self-critical. The model provides opportunity for the social worker to undertake a reflexive inward journey to get rid of biases that affect her practice. The context that is not suitable for self- reflexivity or self-criticism is not suitable for praxis intervention practice either. The praxis practice could also be extended to social work practice in the medical setting, AIDS care, psychiatric social work, management of juvenile delinquency, school social work, correctional administration practices in prison social work, gender related social work practice, geriatric social work, etc. The relevance of praxis intervention in social work. The method could be fruitful in working with the marginalized people as marginalisation is usually a historical phenomenon. This would avoid people losing self-respect and dignity under the conditions of marginalisation. The method could be applied in other conditions of marginalisation such as working with people discriminated on the basis of gender. It can also serve as a model for opportunity scanning. The praxis intervention can be used as a method to initiate and implement participatory project provided the project has sufficient flexibility inbuilt for effecting a change from its pre-designs. A project management from praxis perspective should not have full-fledged blue print beforehand, rather the projects should be flexible enough to wait till the participants themselves research and come out with a project plan. In the new practice, the experts could be facilitated to work with the participants. While a project is designed and carried out with this method, there should be options to change the course of project or even to suspend some projects according to the collective findings and evaluations of the collaborative research. Similarly the praxis method could be used in the planning process provided sufficient flexibility is allowed and reflexivity is tolerated. It has to be further tested whether the model works with socially, economically, and culturally heterogeneous set of people. The praxis intervention model of social intervention may not be applicable in all contexts. There are sections of people who cannot take care of themselves and hence require absolute external care. For example, persons suffering from progressive, irreversible diseases characterised by degeneration of the brain cells such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease would require complete external care. The praxis practice would be inappropriate for the people who do not need care. The approach could be helpful in accompanying people who can be helped to care for themselves. Praxis intervention practice is appropriate for working with the people who can be helped to care themselves within a scale of caring. We also witness from the current literature that the method is used in development of bottom- up organizational ethics, generating participatory forms of art and music and also in transformative nursing practices.

Born in the north of the state, Bruxner was educated at The Armidale School and started studies at University of Sydney but later dropped out to take up employment as a grazier and station agent in Tenterfield. After serving in the Citizen Military Forces from 1911, Bruxner enlisted into the Australian Light Horse upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Serving with distinction in Gallipoli, Egypt and Palestine, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Returning to Australia in 1919, Bruxner sold his business and joined the Progressive Party, being elected to the Parliament of New South Wales for Northern Tablelands at the 1920 election. Bruxner came to political prominence when he led the rural \\"True Blues\\" faction of the Progressive Party that went against their Leader's decision to form a coalition in Sir George Fuller's short-lived government in 1921. Bruxner emerged as the leader of the reduced Progressive Party, which consisted of the members of his faction, but they nevertheless joined with Fuller's Nationalists to form government in 1922. Bruxner also became involved in the New England New State Movement. Bruxner resigned the party leadership, now for the renamed Country Party, at the end of 1925. At the 1927 election, with the abandonment of proportional representation, he won the new seat of Tenterfield unopposed. Bruxner was included in new Premier Thomas Bavin's cabinet as Minister for Local Government, which included the responsibility for transport. He served until Labor won the 1930 election. In April 1932 Bruxner was elected again as the new Country Party Leader, which he would hold continuously until 1958. When Sir Philip Game dismissed Jack Lang and called upon the Leader of the Opposition Bertram Stevens to form a caretaker government in 1932, Stevens formed a coalition with Bruxner's Country Party and Bruxner was named as the first Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Bruxner was also sworn in as Minister for Transport and briefly resumed his former Local Government portfolio. Bruxner also worked with his long-time friend and Minister for Education David Drummond, to establish the New England University College in 1938, which was later to become the University of New England. Bruxner was central in ensuring Alexander Mair became Premier after Stevens was defeated in the house in August 1939. The Coalition lost government at the 10 May 1941 election and Bruxner would never again serve in government. The rest of Bruxner's parliamentary career was to be on the opposition benches, leading the Country Party through five more elections and through the instability of the larger opposition parties that eventually united as the Liberal Party. On 6 May 1958, Bruxner formally resigned as Leader of the Country Party, having served continuously in that role since 1932. He continued to serve in his capacity as Member for Tenterfield for one more term before retiring from politics before the 1962 election. Bruxner was Knighted as a KBE in 1962, and thereafter served in various capacities on boards and continued his passion for horses before his death aged 88 on 28 March 1970. Early life and military career Bruxner was born in Tabulum, near the Clarence River in Northern New South Wales, the second son of English-born grazier Charles Augustus Bruxner (1851‚Äì1915) and his wife Sarah Elizabeth Barnes (1858‚Äì1941). Bruxner was initially educated in private tuition but was soon sent as a boarder first at St Mark's Crescent School in Darling Point, Sydney and then to The Armidale School, where he became School Captain in 1900. From 1901 to 1903, he studied arts and law at the University of Sydney while resident at St Paul's College, but was expelled for non-attendance of lectures. Lieutenant Colonel Bruxner in Palestine in November 1918. Returning to home to work as a grazier, Bruxner eventually moved to Tenterfield and set up business as a Stock and station agent. He also purchased \\"Roseneath\\", a grazing property near Tenterfield, where he bred Hereford cattle. On 17 June 1908 at Christ Church, Kiama, he married Winifred Catherine Hay Caird. Bruxner became vice-president of the local agricultural society and of the Cricket and Rugby clubs in Tenterfield. Being a racehorse owner, Bruxner also rose to be President of the Tenterfield Jockey Club from 1909 to 1911. He was commissioned as a Justice of the Peace in 1914. Bruxner started his military career when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 11 September 1911 in the 6th Australian (New England) Light Horse, Citizen Military Forces, which was redesignated the 5th the following year. When the First World War broke out in September 1914, Bruxner joined up soon after on 10 October 1914 with the 6th Light Horse Regiment in the Australian Imperial Force.Michael Frederick Bruxner, National Library of Australia ‚Äì WWI Service Record. Promoted to captain, Bruxner was sent with his unit to take part in the Gallipoli Campaign, being wounded several times. Later, in 1916, he commanded the 6th during part of the Battle of Romani and served with distinction in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, for which he was mentioned in despatches twice.Celebrities of the A.I.F. no. 71: Lieut.-Col. M.F. Bruxner, DSO, Reveille 9 (11) (July 1936), 8‚Äì9. On 30 May 1917 was appointed by the President of France, Raymond Poincar√©, as a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur \\"in recognition of distinguished services during the campaign\\". Also in 1917, Bruxner was appointed to General Headquarters and rose to be assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general of the ANZAC Mounted Division. For his service he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and appointed as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1919. In July 1919, he returned Australia and was discharged a month later in August. Bruxner then returned to Tenterfield, sold his stock and station agency and went back to his property as a grazier. They eventually raised a family, having a daughter, Helen Elizabeth Bruxner, and two sons, James Caird and John Michael Bruxner. Early political career Bruxner in 1925 as leader of the Progressive Party As a prominent member of his local community, Bruxner became involved in emerging movements to have a political force for regional areas and joined and was convinced by friends to stand as a Progressive Party candidate in the 1920 New South Wales state election. Bruxner was elected under proportional representation with 23% as the second member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly district of Northern Tablelands alongside his friend David Drummond. On 20 December 1920, the Labor Party Premier, James Dooley, and his cabinet resigned after having lost a vote in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly a week before. The Governor, Sir Walter Davidson, then commissioned the Leader of the Opposition, Sir George Fuller, as Premier. As Fuller did not have a majority, he initiated attempts to form a coalition with the Progressive Party. The Progressives split over whether to join the Fuller government into an urban wing, led by Leader Walter Wearne and Deputy Leader Thomas Bavin, which agreed to enter Fuller's coalition and a rural wing (\\"The True Blues\\"), led by Bruxner and Ernest Buttenshaw who offered Fuller only conditional support. After seven hours in government, still without a workable majority, Fuller requested a double-dissolution from Davidson. Davidson refused, on the basis that Dooley still had a majority in the lower house, and Fuller resigned. Davidson then re-commissioned Dooley, who was then granted a dissolution for an election in March 1922. The Progressives were permanently divided and Bruxner and the \\"True Blues\\" who had opposed the coalition maintained their separate identity, while the urban members of the party joined Fuller's Nationalist Party. The Rural Progressives then elected Bruxner in 1922 as Leader for the election. The Progressives were reduced to nine rural members at the 1922 election and entered a Coalition with the Nationalists. Bruxner increased his margin to become the first electorate member with 39%. Bruxner also became involved in the New England New State Movement and helped pass a formal request to the Commonwealth by the Legislative Assembly to establish a new state in northern New South Wales.Totaro, Paola. History's lesson to the bush: if at first you don't secede, try, try again. Sydney Morning Herald. 28 July 2003. The request resulted in the 1924 Cohen Royal Commission into New States. At the May 1925 election, Bruxner retained his seat with an increased margin of 41%, while the Nationalist/Progressive Government lost office to Jack Lang and the Labor Party. After the election, the Progressive party renamed themselves the Country Party, reflecting the electoral base of the party. Bruxner resigned the leadership at the end of 1925, citing the difficulty in balancing the needs of his family with the commitments of his political career, and was succeeded by Ernest Buttenshaw. Minister of the Crown Bill Hedges and Alf Pollack At the 1927 election, with the abandonment of proportional representation, he won the new seat of Tenterfield unopposed. At the election, Lang's Labor Party was defeated and Bruxner was included in new Premier Bavin's cabinet as Minister for Local Government, which included the responsibility for transport. As Minister, Bruxner was responsible for the amendment to the Main Roads Act which gave more powers to the Main Roads Board and provided for the reclassification of the principal roads of the State. All the roads of the state were classified in accordance with their order of importance, which formed the basis for which road development was funded. His view that transport should be a public asset was reinforced when he brought through the passage of the Transport Act 1930, which regulated private bus services to prevent the collapse of government-owned tramways and railways. He remained as Minister until the Bavin Government was defeated by Lang at the 1930 election. At the election, Bruxner retained his seat with 59%. On 23 December 1930, Bruxner was granted by King George V retention of the title \\"The Honourable\\" for having served for more than three years as a Member of the Executive Council of New South Wales. In 1931 Bruxner moved a motion to censure Sydney University Professor of Philosophy John Anderson for his statements that war memorials were \\"political idols\\". The motion was vigorously debated but did not pass.James Franklin, Corrupting the Youth: A History of Philosophy in Australia (Macleay Press, Sydney, 2003), ch. 1. As the political climate in New South Wales became more volatile after Lang's attempts to abolish the Legislative Council and conflict with the Federal Government over debts, Bruxner emphasised the need that the Country Party remain independent of the United Australia Party (which had succeeded the Nationalist Party) amidst calls for the opposition to unite. On 26 April 1932, Country Party Leader Buttenshaw notified the party of his intention to resign. Bruxner was then elected as the new party Leader. Deputy Premier Bruxner entering the Treasury Building, Sydney in 1932 Not long after, on 13 May Governor Sir Philip Game dismissed the Lang government and called upon the Leader of the Opposition and UAP Leader Bertram Stevens to form a caretaker government. Stevens formed a coalition with Bruxner's Country Party and immediately called an election. Lang's NSW Labor Party was heavily defeated and the Country Party gained eleven seats and held five seats on the cabinet. Bruxner retained his seat again unopposed (he would be elected unopposed a total of five times during his term). This time, the Country Party was an equal partner in the coalition and Bruxner was named as the first Deputy Premier of New South Wales. Sworn in on 16 May 1932 as Minister for Transport, Bruxner also briefly resumed his former Local Government portfolio during the caretaker period until 17 June 1932. Insistent that his party take an equal role in the coalition government, Bruxner formed a good working relationship and long-lasting friendship with Stevens that would ensure the government's stability. The Stevens government had significant success, reducing Lang's 2 million pound deficit by 75%. However, one significant problem was that Stevens had trouble with an unruly backbench, and increasingly depended upon Bruxner and the Country Party. As Deputy Premier, Bruxner saw himself as loyal to Stevens, but still managed to push through several initiatives that specifically benefited rural areas, including another royal commission on the question of new States in 1935. The May 1935 election saw Stevens and Bruxner retaining government against a divided and fractious Labor opposition and Bruxner was returned unopposed again in his seat. Bruxner detested the UAP Deputy Leader and Minister for Public Works and Local Government, Eric Spooner, whom Bruxner saw as trying to undermine confidence in Steven's leadership and reducing Country Party influence in the government. When Stevens went on a visit to London in March 1936 for six months until October, Bruxner became Acting Premier, with Spooner as Acting Deputy. The animosity between the two became most pronounced at this time, often over the most petty issues. In May 1937, Bruxner visited the United Kingdom as a member of the NSW parliamentary delegation to the coronation of King George VI. At the March 1938 election, the Stevens-Bruxner government retained power against Lang and the still-divided Labor Party. Bruxner was re-elected with 61% of the vote. Bruxner worked with his long-time friend, now Minister for Education David Drummond, to establish a regional tertiary education institution. After the 1938 election, they moved to establish the New England University College, a constituent college of the University of Sydney in the city of Armidale, and Bruxner was appointed to the first Advisory Council, on which he served until 1951. Bruxner (left) with Premier Stevens in 1939. Bruxner worked well with Stevens and their friendship ensured the government's survival for a record nine years. In July 1939, Stevens and Colonial Treasurer Alexander Mair attempted to address Spooner's unwillingness to accede to cabinet decisions regarding ministerial expenditure by creating a committee of four, consisting of Mair, Stevens, Spooner and Bruxner, to approve all expenditure. Furious at this gesture, Spooner resigned on 21 July 1939 as Minister and Deputy Leader, citing a 'disagreement in government policy on relief works' as the reason. Despite Spooner's departure, the stability of the government was to be short. On 1 August 1939, Spooner carried a motion of no confidence in Stevens in the house, which unexpectedly passed by two votes, owing to the absence of several ministers. On 3 August Stevens tendered his resignation to the Governor, Lord Wakehurst, but was granted several days to remain until his successor was chosen. Upon the resignation, Spooner was touted as Stevens' possible successor until Bruxner, who had always detested Spooner, refused to form a coalition government with him. At a UAP party meeting on 5 August, Spooner chose not to nominate and Steven's favoured candidate, Alexander Mair, defeated Athol Richardson 18 votes to 6, becoming Leader of the United Australia Party and was sworn in as Premier by Lord Wakehurst on the same day. Mair, who had got on well with Bruxner, ensured the survival of the coalition government. Mair attempted to shore up unity in his party to save the government. In the last months of government Bruxner was preoccupied with preparation for Australia's entry into the Second World War. He equipped railway workshops with modern machine tools and established National Emergency Services to deal with air raids. However, despite the efforts of Mair and Bruxner, the controversy surrounding Stevens' departure and a resurgent Labor Party, now led by the moderate William McKell, ensured that the popularity of the government never recovered. At the campaign for the 10 May 1941 election, the government performed poorly, finding it difficult to distinguish themselves from the past and proposing policies but only promising action after the war. McKell's Labor Party did the opposite, leaving war matters to the federal government and promising current reforms. At the election, the Labor Party polled more than half the vote while Bruxner's Country Party lost nine seats and Mair's UAP lost twenty seats. Bruxner retained his seat with 56%. Bruxner would never again hold ministerial office and the conservative political forces would not take government again until Robert Askin and Charles Cutler won the 1965 election. In opposition The rest of Bruxner's parliamentary career was to be on the opposition benches, due largely to the disintegration of the larger opposition party, the UAP, after the 1943 Federal election. A large number of former UAP members then formed the Democratic Party in New South Wales, led by Mair, who continued as Opposition Leader. Mair resigned as Democratic Party Leader on 10 February 1944, to be replaced by former Assembly Speaker Reginald Weaver. At the 1944 election, Bruxner's stable leadership ensured that the Country Party retained all ten of its seats in the Legislative Assembly. Bruxner retained his seat with 67.73%. Bruxner witnessed the fragmented opposition parties forming into the Liberal Party in 1945, under the leadership of Weaver, Mair and then former Justice Minister Vernon Treatt from March 1946. Bruxner led the party, again being elected unopposed, again at the May 1947 election, achieving an overall gain of 5 seats from independents and the Labor Party, now led by James McGirr. Recognising the importance of the larger Liberals to opposing Labor while also being responsive to the needs of the Country Party's rural voters, Bruxner maintained the Country Party's coalition with the Liberals as well as trying to prevent seat conflicts between the two parties. However, it was to be the persistence of these \\"tri-cornered\\" contested seats between Labor, Liberal and Country candidates that were to prove problematic not only for maintaining the coalition but also for attempting to wrest government from Labor. Treatt and Bruxner led the Coalition at the 17 June 1950 election, which resulted in a hung parliament. The Country Party gained two seats for a total of 17 for a Coalition total of 46 seats. With the Labor Party also holding 46 seats, the balance of power lay with the two re-elected Independent Labor members, James Geraghty and John Seiffert, who had been expelled from the Labor Party for disloyalty during the previous parliament. Seiffert was readmitted and, with the support of Geraghty, McGirr and Labor were able to stay in power. Bruxner retained his seat with 60%. He sold his \\"Roseneath\\" property in 1950 and in 1951 bought the homestead section of Old Auburn Vale station, dividing his time between there and his Sydney residence in Bellevue Hill. The near loss of the election by Labor further weakened McGirr's position and he was replaced as premier by Joseph Cahill in April 1952. Cahill had won popular support as a vigorous and impressive minister who had resolved problems with New South Wales' electricity supply and in his first 10 months as premier had reinvigorated the party. He brought order to the government's chaotic public works program. In addition, he attacked the increasingly unpopular federal Coalition government of Robert Menzies. All this, combined with Bruxner and Treatt constantly clashing over policy and candidate issues, contributed to the Liberal-Country Coalition again being defeated at the 14 February 1953 election. This amounted to a total loss of ten seats, three being Country Party seats, and a swing against them of 7.2%. Bruxner retained his seat with 60.15%. Murray Robson replaced Treatt as Leader of the Opposition in August 1954. Like other senior members of the Liberals, after having no conservative government since Alexander Mair in 1941, Robson had no experience in government, he had little interest in policy except for Cold War anti- communism, ignored majority views of his party and fellow parliamentary colleagues and Robson's attempts to forge a closer alliance with Bruxner and the Country Party, failed dismally and alienated him from many in his party. Robson was replaced by Pat Morton as leader in September 1955. Bruxner, now aged 70 and having fallen ill several times, led the Country Party one last time at the March 1956 election, which resulted in another labour victory and Country Party regained the seat of Armidale, but overall the government's majority fell from twenty to six.The Liberals: The NSW Division 1945‚Äì2000, pg 98. Bruxner retained Tenterfield unopposed. On 6 May 1958, Bruxner formally resigned as Leader of the Country Party, having served continuously in that role since 1932. He continued to serve in his capacity as Member for Tenterfield, retaining his seat one final time at the March 1959 election, with 68% of the vote. After a final term he retired from the assembly before the election in 1962. Retirement and legacy Upon his retirement, his youngest son, James Caird (Tim) Bruxner, who had served with distinction in the 2nd AIF and the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II, gained preselection for his father's vacated seat, allegedly against his parent's advice, and won it at the 1962 election. Tim Bruxner went on to become a member of the Askin, Lewis and Willis Cabinets from 1973‚Äì1976, including in his father's old portfolio as Minister for Transport and as Deputy Leader of the Country Party.\\"In Father's Footsteps...doing the job where you can't please everyone\\". Sydney Morning Herald 8 February 1976 pg 64. His eldest son, John Michael Bruxner, having graduated from Sydney University with honours in law in 1935, was admitted to the Bar in 1936 and also served in the 2nd AIF as an officer. On 2 June 1954, he was appointed as a Judge of the District Court of New South Wales. Upon retiring from politics, Bruxner was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1962 \\"For political and public services\\". On 2 November 1959, the Mains Roads Board named the highway spanning across Northern NSW as the \\"Bruxner Highway\\" in recognition of his services to transport and roads in NSW. Throughout his life, Bruxner had maintained his passion for horses, including as a member of the Australian Jockey Club and the Sydney Turf Club. From 1960 Bruxner was also Deputy President of the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales. His wife Winifred having died the year before in 1969, Bruxner died on 28 March 1970, survived by his daughter and both sons. His portrait by William Chandler is in the National Party offices in Sydney, and a sketch of him by George Washington Lambert is in the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.

The term The concept of a Russian soul arose in the 1840s chiefly as a literary phenomenon. Writer Nikolai Gogol and literary critic Vissarion Belinskii jointly coined the term upon the publication of Gogol's masterpiece Dead Souls in 1842. At the time landowners often referred to their serfs as ‚Äúsouls‚Äù for accounting purposes, and the novel's title refers to the protagonist's scheme of purchasing claims to deceased serfs. Apart from this literal meaning, however, Gogol also intended the title as an observation of landowners‚Äô loss of soul in exploiting serfs. Vissarion Belinskii, a notedly radical critic, took Gogol's intentions a few steps farther and inferred from the novel a new recognition of a national soul, existing apart from the government and founded in the lives of the lower class. Indeed, Belinskii used the term ‚ÄúRussian soul‚Äù several times in his analyses of Gogol's work, and from there the phrase grew in prominence, and eventually became more clearly defined through the writings of authors such as Fyodor Dostoyevsky. This famous brand of nationalism, however, was the product of a continuous effort by Russia's various classes to define a national identity. Gogol and his contemporaries established literature as Russia's new weapon of choice, the tool by which it could inform itself of its greatness and urge the nation to its destined position as a world leader. Gogol may not have had such grand notions, but with the help of Vissarion Belinsky he paved the way for a new concept of Russian identity - the great Russian soul. As opposed to the preceding ‚ÄúRussian spirit‚Äù (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –¥—É—Ö), which focused on Russia's past, ‚ÄúRussian soul‚Äù was an expression of optimism. It stressed Russia's historical youth and its ability, by following the wisdom of the peasant, to become the savior of the world. Indeed, although the concept of the Russian soul grew upon Western ideas, its advocates believed that Russia had made those ideas its own and would use them to save Europe from itself. The term Russian soul is also to found in Russian folk culture. Culmination of the concept =Dostoyevsky= The Russian soul evolved and entered into Western consciousness in the following decades, most famously through the work of Fyodor Dostoyevsky. In his novels and stories, Dostoyevsky exhibited an often anti-European nationalism and frequently suggested a \\"people's spirit\\" held together by \\"unexpressed, unconscious ideas which are merely strongly felt\\". By Dostoyevsky's death in 1881, the \\"Russian soul\\" had completed its evolution in Russia. Dostoevsky had the following opinion about the freedom and strength of the Russian soul. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs frightening how free a Russian man‚Äôs spirit is, how strong is his will! No one has ever been so much torn away from his native soil, as he sometimes had to be; nobody ever took a turn so sharp, as he, following his own belief!‚Äù \\\\- Fyodor Dostoevsky =After Dostoyevsky= From about 1880 to 1930, largely thanks to Dostoyevsky, the \\"Russian soul\\" concept spread to other countries and began to affect foreign perception of the Russian people. For many Europeans the idea offered a positive alternative to the typical view of Russians as backward, instead depicting the Russian people as an example of the innocence the West had lost. The popularity of the \\"Russian soul\\" continued into the 20th century but faded as Soviet power increased. By the 1930s the concept was slipping into obscurity, but it would survive in the work of the numerous writers who devised it.

Fisheries and aquaculture Part of a gilt-head bream Gilthead seabream is an esteemed food fish, but catches of wild fish have been relatively modest, between 6,100 and 9,600 tonnes in 2000‚Äì2009, primarily from the Mediterranean. In addition, gilthead seabream have traditionally been cultured extensively in coastal lagoons and saltwater ponds. However, intensive rearing systems were developed during the 1980s, and gilthead seabream has become an important aquaculture species, primarily in the Mediterranean area. Reported production was negligible until the late 1980s, but reached 140,000 tonnes in 2010, thus dwarfing the capture fisheries production. Greece is the biggest seabream producer in Europe, followed by Turkey.http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/naso_greece/en Gilthead seabream in aquaculture are susceptible to parasitic infections, including from Enterospora nucleophila.

Several California tribes signed treaties with the United States in 1851 which promised lands to the tribes; however these treaties were never ratified and many California tribes were left completely landless. In 1901, the United States Congress passed several laws, known as the Homeless Indian Acts.

Cause Rickettsioses can be divided into a spotted fever group (SPG) and typhus group (TG). In the past, rickettsioses were considered to be caused by species of Rickettsia. However, scrub typhus is still considered a rickettsiosis, even though the causative organism has been reclassified from Rickettsia tsutsugamushi to Orientia tsutsugamushi. Examples of rickettsioses include typhus, both endemic and epidemic, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Rickettsialpox. Organisms involved include Rickettsia parkeri. Many new causative organisms have been identified in the last few decades. Most are in the genus Rickettsia, but scrub typhus is in the genus Orientia. Diagnosis No rapid laboratory tests are available to diagnose rickettsial diseases early in the course of illness, and serologic assays usually take 10‚Äì12 days to become positive. Research is indicating that swabs of eschars may be used for molecular detection of rickettsial infections. Treatment Doxycycline has been used in the treatment of rickettsial infection.

This film and In Like Flint (1967) were the last movies made in CinemaScope, with most studios moving to Panavision and other widescreen processes. Plot In the Swiss Alps, a skier shoots and kills another skier down a mountain slope. Cut to a woman picking up a newspaper in Paris, the headline story telling of yet another Interpol agent killed in Switzerland. That woman is Patricia Foster (Doris Day), an industrial designer for Femina Cosmetics, owned by Sir Jason Fox (Edward Mulhare). She is caught trying to sell a secret Femina cosmetics formula to a rival company, May Fortune, owned by Matthew Cutter (Jack Kruschen). After her arrest, her subsequent release, and her firing from Femina, Patricia is hired by Cutter, but she states she will not divulge any of Femina's other secrets as part of this employment. However, this selling of secrets was a scheme devised by Sir Jason for Patricia to steal a secret formula for a new water- repellent hairspray from Cutter, the formula invented by Dr Stuart Clancy (Ray Walston), May Fortune's head chemist. Patricia is wooed by Cutter's right-hand man, Christopher White (Richard Harris), who drugs her with truth serum to get her to divulge Femina's other secrets to him. Patricia, however, was aware of what Christopher was trying to do; she only pretended to be drugged and passed along false information. While she cannot get the formula from Cutter or Clancy, Patricia learns that the formula can be obtained through analysis of a lock of hair from the one person known to have used the hairspray, Clancy's secretary, Su Ling (Irene Tsu). As Patricia goes to work trying to cut off a lock of Su Ling's hair, Christopher spots her. Patricia is unable to get a lock of hair, but Christopher tells her that he too is truly working for Sir Jason, and has the proof to back up his claim. Later, Christopher is seen setting up surveillance, which includes speaking to Cutter via hidden microphone, Cutter stating that it will be good to see an undercover agent of Sir Jason's caught red-handed trying to steal his formula. Patricia sees what Christopher is doing, although she is assured by Sir Jason that Christopher indeed does work for him and not Cutter. Patricia still does not trust Christopher. She does whatever she can to thwart the surveillance that Christopher has set up, much to Christopher's and Cutter's chagrin. At a date with one of his regulars named Miranda (Lisa Seagram) ‚Äì a May Fortune model who Patricia earlier seemed to recognize ‚Äì Christopher learns that Patricia Foster is not the real name of the woman whom May Fortune has just hired. At The Times newspaper archives, Christopher is looking through old clippings of a story concerning a man named Robert Fowler being murdered in the Swiss Alps while skiing. At Su's apartment, Patricia finds her unconscious on the floor, seemingly drugged. She takes a small sample of a black powder lying on the coffee table, which she believes was used to drug Su and which she later gives to Sir Jason to have analyzed for her. Patricia finds a bottle of the hairspray, which she takes with her. Christopher catches her, blackmailing her that he will tell Sir Jason that her real name is Felippa Fowler. Dr Clancy arrives, but Patricia and Christopher manage to escape him and the police without being seen. At a later rendezvous, Patricia admits to Christopher that her real name is indeed Felippa Fowler, and that her father ‚Äì the man featured in the news clipping ‚Äì was murdered in Switzerland while on the trail of a narcotics ring. Before his death, he had divulged that the head of the narcotics ring was discovered to be a woman, most probably the person who killed him. Although finding her father's killer is her main objective, Patricia is still devoted to Sir Jason, to whom she plans to give the bottle of hairspray. Purposely breaking the bottle upon hearing this news ‚Äì but noticing that the bottle is an expensive Swiss one not used by Cutter ‚Äì Christopher in turn tells Patricia that Clancy has Swiss connections ‚Äì that he is married to a Swiss woman still living in Switzerland. Patricia goes to Switzerland and finds a woman named Madame Piasco (Lilia Skala) ‚Äì Clancy's mother-in-law ‚Äì who is the actual cosmetics expert who had long ago come up with the formula for herself to protect her hair for skiing. She gives a bottle to Patricia for free, as Madame Piasco states that May Fortune now has the distribution rights and it will soon be on the market in America. Patricia goes skiing on the same hill where her father was killed, and comes under fire from a masked skier. She is rescued by Christopher, who arrives in a helicopter in the nick of time. Patricia believes it is Clancy who tried to kill her, while Christopher thinks it could not be him. He seems unconcerned about the news about the hairspray or Clancy's mother-in-law, which makes Patricia realize that neither Christopher nor Sir Jason was ever after the hairspray. Christopher tells her the story: Clancy used to be the chief cosmetics chemist for Sir Jason, but was an utter failure at it, and Sir Jason's true goal was to discover and hire the true chemical mastermind behind Clancy, whose identity he still does not know. Regardless, Patricia plans to give the hairspray solely to Sir Jason, which was her agreed mission. Christopher and Patricia profess their love for each other, but Christopher requests one more job from her concerning Sir Jason. Out in the middle of a snowy mountaintop, Christopher has secretly placed a microphone on Patricia and secretly films her while she goes to speak to Clancy off in the distance. She offers Clancy a job with Femina as head chemist, with an illegal under- the-table bonus. Clancy declines as he says that Cutter already knows about Madame Piasco, and if Cutter does not care, he is happy where he is. Cut to Cutter's office where he is watching the film that Christopher took of Clancy's and Patricia's encounter. He tells Christopher that this footage, which he plans to broadcast, will ruin Sir Jason forever. But Cutter is angry that Christopher has not kept Patricia under confinement for her illegal role in the matter; he in return states that they can nab Patricia as she leaves Sir Jason's. Patricia is visiting with Sir Jason, who tells her that he was able to convince Madame Piasco to come and work for him, which Patricia finds incredible. Sir Jason also tells her about the analysis of the black powder, which contains a powerful narcotic. Patricia in turn tells him that she already had the powder analyzed herself, and this analysis conducted by Sir Jason was a test purely to see if he would tell the truth or a lie, the latter of which would implicate him in her father's murder. Sir Jason also tells her that Christopher had her encounter with Clancy filmed, that Cutter plans to broadcast it to the world to ruin him, and that the Paris police after being shown the film, are now after her for bribery. He states that Christopher's motivation is purely financial, as he collects from both sides. Patricia is heartbroken about this news concerning Christopher. As the police are ready to arrest Patricia outside Sir Jason's apartment, Christopher snatches her away. He admits that he works for Interpol. Later, Patricia is able to tell Christopher's Interpol colleagues that the narcotics were smuggled as May Fortune face powder, which was perfectly harmless until incinerated, but then turned into a powerful hallucinogen. None of them believes that Cutter is smart enough to be the head of the narcotics ring. Donning a microphone to Interpol while searching through Cutter's Paris office, Patricia tries to tell the cleaning lady who enters the office she need not clean here. The cleaning lady is revealed to be Clancy in disguise, with a gun ‚Äì he being the mysterious woman killer. As Patricia and Clancy move through the building, they scuffle, a gunshot is heard; Clancy is shot, and tumbles over the railing to his death several stories below. Sir Jason, the co-conspirator of the narcotics ring, arrives wielding a gun against Patricia. With Clancy dead, Sir Jason will have the cosmetics market all to himself. Sir Jason manages to force Patricia into a helicopter and take off. Christopher shoots and kills him from a distance, leaving a frightened Patricia alone in the air. She manages to fly the helicopter back to Paris and land it atop the Eiffel Tower. Patricia and Christopher live happily ever after.

Reception =Box office= The 20th Century Fox release was a box office bomb, failing to place in the top 20 movies for 1967. According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $7,200,000 in rentals to break even and made $4,580,000, meaning it lost money. =Critical= Film critic Leonard Maltin‚Äôs review of the film was quite negative. He gave the film zero stars and said the film was a ‚Äúterrible vehicle for Day.‚Äù In her memoir, Day recounts an argument she had with her manager-husband Martin Melcher over the script for Caprice, unaware he had signed her name to the contracts before she had the chance to say no. On the DVD commentary, authors Pierre Patrick and John Cork discuss the ways the screenplay was rewritten, ostensibly to please the star. They speculated that recent interest in the film's mixture of slapstick, satire, and adventure‚Äîcoupled with its Mod design‚Äîhas acquired renewed respect from film buffs and, possibly, from Day herself. Music The title theme sung by Doris Day was released as the flip- side to her final single release on the Columbia Records label, the A-side being a more uptempo number, \\"Sorry.\\" Adaptations The screenplay by Jay Jayson and Tashlin was novelized by Julia Withers and was published in paperback by Dell in February, 1967.

Path of the Furon is an action-adventure video game developed by American studio Sandblast Games and published by THQ. The game is set in the 1970s and is the fourth and final installment in the original Destroy All Humans! franchise. It was released December 1, 2008 in North America for the Xbox 360. ‚Äì THQ CEO Brian Farrell mentions work on the Destroy All Humans franchise for the 2008 fiscal year. Path of the Furon expands on the open world format of the previous Destroy All Humans! games, with five open worlds on the ground and in the air to obliterate with weapons and alien powers. On November 26, 2008, the North American PlayStation 3 version was canceled citing \\"development issues\\". However, the PlayStation 3 version was still released in Australia on February 12, 2009 and Europe on February 13, 2009 alongside the Xbox 360 release. Gameplay Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon has over 30-story missions, 20 side quests, and multiplayer modes. As with previous games, most story missions can be played in a non-linear order. Creative director Jon Knoles stated that the side quests would be related to the story, would also be creative, and \\"epic\\". Knoles added that the achievements are tied to statistic tracking in the game, and they are unique to the weapons and abilities found, allowing the player to experiment with different possibilities. For example, IGN noted that when the player takes the \\"Sunny\\" off of the Sunnywood sign they get a cutscene and one of the more creative achievements. There are also challenges and mini-games that the player can return to repeatedly to better their score and collect more rewards. There are five new open-world locations based on Las Vegas (\\"Las Paradiso\\"), Hollywood (\\"Sunnywood\\"), Hong Kong (\\"Shen Long\\"), Paris (\\"Belleville\\"), and the home planet of the Furons itself, The 4th Ring of Furon. =Multiplayer= This game features split screen offline multiplayer. Most challenges are player versus player, although one is co-op. The maps are scaled down versions of their single-player counterparts. The games are Ion Soccer, where players use their ion detonators to shoot a ball into each other's goals, Brain-O-Matic, where players PK humans into a machine that will extract their brains for processing, and Abductorama, basically a competitive game of \\"keep away\\", in which the goal of the game is to abduct the ball, and keep it out of the reach of the other player until the player color fills up the bar, or get the bar filled up more than the other player and keep it like that until time runs out. There are no co-op single-player missions, nor can the player play through the story with co-op. Plot After the events of Big Willy Unleashed, Cryptosporidium 138 (Crypto) (J. Grant Albrecht) crashed his old saucer into the Space Dust casino in Las Paradiso while drunk, perishing in the crash. His cohort Orthopox 13 (Pox) (Richard Horvitz) clones Crypto 139, and they take ownership of the casino, which they use to maintain a steady flow of cash and human DNA. They discover that the local mob seeks to gather information on them. Crypto defeats the mob, destroying their profits and taking control of the city. Soon he begins hearing an etheric voice beckoning him to the path of enlightenment. As Crypto begins to discover the potential of his powers, strange creatures arrive and attack. Pox identifies them as Nexosporidium warriors (Nexos), who are supposedly extinct. In an act of desperation, Pox orders Crypto to destroy all of Paradiso to erase any evidence of their being there. Crypto reluctantly does so, and the pair flee to Sunnywood. In Sunnywood, the duo assume Curt Calvin (Andre Sogliuzzo), leader of the Lunarian Church of Alientology, to be another DNA harvesting Furon on Earth. They stage an alien landing to draw Calvin out. Crypto confronts the cult leader and demands he show his true Furon form. A Nexosporidium walker appears and steps on Calvin, revealing he is actually human. After defeating the walker, Crypto is shot in the neck with a dart and faints. Crypto converses with The Master.Crypto awakens days later in a monastery ran by a Furon known as The Master (Darryl Kurylo). He reveals that one hundred years ago imperial traitors marked Emperor Meningitis, ruler of the Furon Empire, for death. He stopped the assassination, but was in turn marked for death. Fleeing to Earth, he crash-landed off the coast of China near the town of Shen Long. He soon realized eastern philosophies could help him improve his mental abilities, and so immersed himself in their culture. He built an academy and passed on knowledge to followers. His apprentice, Saxon (James Horan), became power hungry, forming a triad to oppose him. When Crypto next returns to the monastery, he witnesses Saxon kill the Master. He interrogates the villain at gunpoint amidst the sudden appearance of Nexos, and Saxon dies in the confusion. Pox deduces that the Nexos have been cloned on Earth, and only one organization could accomplish such. They then set off for Belleville, France, home of the Francodyne corporation. Crypto infiltrates the mansion of Francodyne's CEO Henri Crousteau (Michael Lonsdale), but Crousteau escapes. Pox and Crypto learn Crousteau intends to create a virus to destroy the Furon DNA within the human genome. Crypto sets out to destroy his Nexo manufacturing operation. He causes a riot between the workers and destroys the Nexo laboratory. However, Crousteau still manages to create the virus and sends four Nexo walkers to distribute it into the river. Crypto destroys the walkers and defeats Crousteau in a final battle at the Belleville tower. He learns that Crousteau only wanted to destroy his own race to stop the planet from being polluted, that he was feeding the Nexos synthetic DNA, and that he wasn't responsible for the attack on the casino. The Nexos that attacked were rogues responding to a signal from the Furon homeworld. Crypto realizes that Emperor Meningitis (Nolan North) is responsible. He and Pox set off for the Fourth Ring of Furon to confront the emperor. Upon arriving, Crypto immediately attacks the palace. The emperor expels them from the city and erects a large shield. Pox and Crypto manage to deactivate it and re-enter the city. Pox reveals that since he once worked for the emperor, his biometrics are still in the system, allowing them to open the palace door. Crypto and Pox download Pox's clone data from the imperial repository and clone Pox a new body, Orthopox 14. However the wrong mold is used, and Pox exits the machine with a simian appearance. Pox informs Crypto they'll need a distraction, and to start a human riot in the artificial human habitat. As the riot ensues, Crypto confronts Meningitis, defeating him, but the emperor disintegrates from old age before he can be interrogated. The Master then reappears from the Jade Talisman Crypto inherited from him, revealing that he was the conspirator who set everything in motion and controlled the Nexos. The Jade Talisman was actually a cloning device used so that after Meningitis was defeated, he could become the new emperor. Crypto becomes infuriated and motions towards Pox to slam The Master against a wall, killing him. Feeling defeated, Crypto tries a canister of synthetic DNA, but vomits at its horrible taste. Pox tells Crypto that as long as synthetic DNA cannot be stomached, their mission wasn't a sham. Crypto realizes that Pox is right, and decides to return to Earth. Pox then tells Crypto he isn't returning with him, and takes the throne. As Crypto walks out of the palace, the other Furons begin running in to greet their new emperor. Development The musical score is performed by composer Garry Schyman. According to the game's creative director, Jon Knoles, there are approximately 15,000 lines of spoken dialogue in the game. There is more back and forth banter between Crypto and Pox, interactive conversations, and more human minds to read. There are between 30 and 50 thoughts for each human in the game and about 2000 in total. Reception Destroy All Humans! Path of the Furon received \\"generally unfavorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Reviews of the in-game soundtrack fared generally better. GameZone said, \\"The score still has that sci-fi B-movie feel with a heavy dose of '70s-styled funk and disco tossed in for good measure.\\" References Category:2008 video games Category:Action- adventure games Category:Destroy All Humans Category:Multiplayer and single- player video games Category:Open world video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Science fiction video games Category:THQ games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in 1979 Category:Xbox 360 games ","title":"Destroy All Humans!

Over much of history, the village was under control of von Bibra family (c.1356 - 1850). Much of the manor house still exists. The village received the right to hold a market in 1743 and commerce flourished. Before World War I, about one third of the population was Jewish. A Jewish cemetery is outside of town. The church, which stands somewhat in the middle of the village, was built onto the tower in 1843.

The term was used by Langdon Winner in his essay Technology as forms of life. Winner puts forth the idea that we are simply in a state of sleepwalking in our mediations with technology. This sleepwalking is caused by a number of factors. One of the primary causes is the way we view technology as tools, something that can be put down and picked up again. Because of this view of objects as something we can easily separate ourselves from technology, and so we fail to look at the long term implications of using that object. A second factor is the separation of those who make the technology and those who use the technology. This division causes there to be little thought and research going into the effects of using/developing that technology. The third and most important idea is the way in which technology seems to create new worlds in which we live. These worlds are created by the restructuring of the common and seemingly everyday things around us. In most situations the changes take place with little attention or care from us because we are more focused on the menial aspects of the technology (Winner 105-107).Winner, Langdon. \\"Technologies as Forms of Life\\". Readings in the Philosophy of Technology. David M. Kaplan. Oxford: Rowman & Littlefield, 2004, . 103-113 The concept can be found in the earlier work of Marshall McLuhan, cf. Understanding Media, where he refers to a comment made by David Sarnoff expressing a socially deterministic view of \\"value free\\" technology whose value is solely defined by its usage as representing, \\"...the voice of the current somnambulism\\".McLuhan, Marshall. Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man. New York: McGraw Hill, 1964. Given that this piece by McLuhan has become standard reading in Media Theory it is reasonable to suspect that Winner encountered the concept there or elsewhere and then went on to develop it further.

The district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. In 2010, by town meeting vote, this district became part of a larger, officially zoned local historic district.  Town Pound  The Town Pound is a square-shaped stone structure, open at the top and entered through a gate. It was constructed in 1774, and originally was topped with a wooden enclosure.  Town Hall  The Town Hall is Lyndeborough's third completed hall, and the second to occupy a site in the Historic District. (The town's second Town Hall, a two-story, meetinghouse, occupied roughly the same site from c. 1769 until 1845.) The current hall is a -story Greek Revival building, constructed in 1845-46 as a building with a meeting hall and one anteroom at the southeast corner. In 1883, the town significantly enlarged the building by removing the west wall and adding a addition to the back of the building and installing partitions to create the northeast anteroom (now used as a kitchen)and a small entry foyer. In 1890, apparently at the urging of and with the help of the Pinnacle Grange (the local chapter of The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry), the town increased the pitch of the roof, thereby adding space in the attic for dinners and other functions, and added an ell to the southwest corner. At this time a metal roof was added to the building, though it was removed in 1919. A metal ceiling was installed in the meeting room in 1913, an Arts-and- Crafts-style stage sometime between 1913 and 1919, and a second chimney behind the stage in 1920. (The piano now sitting against the stage wall dates from 1919.) A storage area was added to the back of the building in 1913. The attic was remodeled in 1934, and electricity was installed in the building in 1937. Since 1975, the building has appeared on Lyndeborough's unofficial town seal.  Congregational Church  The Greek Revival-style Congregational Church dates from 1837, when pressure from the Baptist Society resulted in the church moving out of the third town hall. According to Donovan and Woodward, in their History of Lyndeborough, the church steeple was shortened sometime in the nineteenth century when it was hit by lightning; in fact, exterior details suggest the entire steeple may have been rebuilt prior to or during the mid-1850s, when the church bell was added. The interior of the church was extensively remodeled in the 1890s, and the entire structure underwent major structural repairs in the mid-1980s. Since the merging of the Baptist and Congregationalist churches in town, the church has been under the control of the United Church of Lyndeborough. Currently it is used for summer services, as the building is not heated. From 1837 until about 1920, horse sheds occupied the area between the Congregational Church and the Town Pound.  Roads and stone walls  Three roads pass through the Historic District: Center Road, which is a paved class-IV (state-maintained) road; Stone Bridge Road, which is an unpaved class-VI (unmaintained town) road; and an unnamed class-VI right-of-way connecting Center Road to a lower section of Stone Bridge Road. Center Road was created as a two-rod (33-foot) right-of-way sometime before 1770, and was widened to three rods (50 feet) as part of a project to create a road across Hillsborough County in 1800-1804. The right- of-way was widened in 1840 between New Road and Stone Bridge Road because of problems relating to blowing snow. The original section of Center Road, which ran much closer to the Old Town Hall, Town Pound, Congregational Church, and Congregational Parsonage, was not discontinued, but generally fell into disuse as a travelled road after 1840. It is now part of the town common. Stone Bridge Road is a two-rod (33-foot) right-of-way that was constructed in 1770 to connect Lyndeborough Center (and the meetinghouse) to western Lyndeborough. The road connected to Putnam Hill Road, which allowed travel from the Town Hall to the site of the first town meetinghouse, into South Lyndeborough and through what later became the South Lyndeborough Village Common, and along Citizens' Hall Road and Pettingill Hill Road before veering southward into Wilton. The unnamed class-VI road appears as a road on an 1858 map of Hillsborough County, but like Stone Bridge Road, fell into disuse by 1892 (though it was never discontinued, and thus legally is still a public right- of-way). Under New Hampshire law it is a prescriptive road, created through \\"adverse possession\\" (continuous public use) over a 20-year period prior to January 1, 1968. Thus, the width of the right-of-way is legally undetermined, but is assumed to be two rods. The stone walls behind the Town Pound, Town Hall, and former Town Barn date from about 1800. The stone wall along the east side of Center Road dates from 1840, when the road was moved to its current position.  Town Common  The Town Common between the current Town Hall and Congregational Church, and which runs in front of the church and Town Pound, was created in 1840 when Center Road was moved to its current location east of the original right-of-way. The right-of-way over the common was never discontinued, giving the town the right to use the common space for public purposes. However, the remainder of the land around the Town Hall has been referred to as the \\"Common\\" since at least 1770, during construction of the original meetinghouse at this site. Originally the common extended from what today is the north side of the Town Pound to the north side of the Center Cemetery. (The cemetery was added around 1800.) However, the town sold a small portion of the common adjacent to the cemetery's north side in 1817 to pay for repairs to the original meetinghouse. Today that land‚Äîapproximately one acre in area‚Äîis a privately owned apple orchard. Meanwhile, the area west of the meetinghouse became private property at an undetermined time in the 19th century, but was donated back to the town in 2001. In 1940 the town added a flagpole to the common. The current fiberglass pole which replaced it dates from approximately 1999.  Town Barn  The historic district also includes a noncontributing (newer) structure, the Town Barn. Constructed c. 1938, the building housed the town's highway department until the mid-1980s. In 1997, the town rented it to the Lafayette Artillery Company for 99 years at $1 per year. It continues to serve as the Artillery's headquarters. The building occupies a site immediately adjacent to the former location of the town's old late-nineteenth-century hearse house.  Controlling organizations  Currently, several entities oversee the properties that compose the Lyndeborough Center Historic District. By state statute, the Board of Selectmen controls the Town Hall, Town Pound, common, and roads. The Lyndeborough Highway Department oversees general maintenance of the grounds. The local Cemetery Trustees oversee the cemetery (which is part of the local historic district, but is not part of the federally recognized historic district). The Lafayette Artillery Company rents the Town Barn. The United Church of Lyndeborough controls the church building, though technically the building continues to belong to the Congregational Society/United Church of Christ. From the late 1980s until 2010, the local Meetinghouse Committee recommended repairs to the Town House to the Board of Selectmen. Starting in 2010, the Lyndeborough Center Historic District Commission has overseen issues relating to historic preservation and zoning for the entire district, with special attention to the maintenance, repair, and restoration of the Town Hall. The commission adopted rules and regulations pertaining to the district on September 13, 2012. Finally, the Lyndeborough Trails Association has worked to improve Stone Bridge Road for the use of horse traffic.  Local monuments controversy  In 2009, a controversy erupted over the historic district when the Meetinghouse Committee, which at the time advised the Board of Selectmen on matters relating to the upkeep to the Town Hall, suggested that the Selectmen approve the permanent removal of the town's war memorials and Civil War-era Hartshorn Memorial Cannon to the historic district. The monuments were moved to the center temporarily, but who moved them‚Äîand on whose authority‚Äîremains unknown. Subsequently, in 2010, a town Monuments Committee determined that the move was not appropriate, as it created a new focal point which detracted from the historic district's authenticity. In April 2010, the Board of Selectmen voted to move the monuments to South Lyndeborough, from which they had been taken.

They are fished, mostly by trawling, with the flesh being well regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed their conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Taxonomy This fish was first described in 1758 as Mullus barbatus by the Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae. FishBase currently recognizes two subspecies, though the validity of M. b. ponticus is uncertain: * M. b. barbatus (red mullet) Linnaeus, 1758 (found throughout most of its range) * M. b. ponticus (blunt-snouted mullet) Essipov, 1927 (found in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov) Description The red mullet can grow to a standard length of , but a more common length is about half that. The body is somewhat laterally compressed. The snout is short and steep and there are no spines on the operculum. The upper jaw is toothless, but there are teeth on the roof of the mouth and on the lower jaw. A pair of moderately long barbels on the chin do not exceed the pectoral fins in length. The first dorsal fin has eight spines (the first one tiny) and the second dorsal fin has one spine and eight soft rays. This fish is rose-pink, without distinctive markings on its fins. Distribution and habitat The red mullet is found in the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the northeastern and central eastern Atlantic Ocean, where its range extends from Scandinavia southwards to Senegal, including Canary Islands, Azores and Madeira. It is a demersal fish and occurs at depths ranging from over muddy, sandy or gravel bottoms. Ecology The red mullet is carnivorous, the diet consisting mainly of polychaete worms, bivalve molluscs and crustaceans. The barbels are sensory organs and are used to help locate prey. Both young and adult mullet are preyed on by various fish including the angler fish (Lophius piscatorius), the thornback ray (Raja clavata), the common stingray (Dasyatis pastinaca), the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus), the John Dory (Zeus faber) and the European hake (Merluccius merluccius). Breeding takes place in the spring and summer, with spawning occurring in April and May in the Adriatic Sea, at depths between . The larvae soon move to shallower depths and are pelagic, as are the juveniles at first. At a length of about the juveniles move to the coast and become demersal, often congregating in estuaries, and sometimes swimming a short distance upstream. Later they disperse to muddy, sandy or gravelly substrates, becoming sexually mature at a length of during their first year of life. Status The flesh of the red mullet is much esteemed and it is the target of fisheries, especially in the Mediterranean Sea and northeastern and central eastern Atlantic Ocean. It is mainly caught by trawling, but also with trammel nets, gill nets and hook and line, and in artisanal fisheries with traps and spears. In the Mediterranean there are signs of overfishing, and many of the fish caught are shorter than in total length, and being under two years old, are not yet sexually mature. For conservation of the species in the Mediterranean, the breeding grounds and nursery areas need to be protected. It is also heavily fished off the coast of northwestern Africa. Here the fish are caught by local artisan fishermen as well as by foreign industrial fleets; they may be the targeted species or may be bycatch in hake, cephalopod or shrimp fisheries, but the catch statistics are not subdivided by species.

The techniques also apply to cluster analysis. Minimum facility location A simple facility location problem is the Weber problem, in which a single facility is to be placed, with the only optimization criterion being the minimization of the weighted sum of distances from a given set of point sites. More complex problems considered in this discipline include the placement of multiple facilities, constraints on the locations of facilities, and more complex optimization criteria. In a basic formulation, the facility location problem consists of a set of potential facility sites L where a facility can be opened, and a set of demand points D that must be serviced. The goal is to pick a subset F of facilities to open, to minimize the sum of distances from each demand point to its nearest facility, plus the sum of opening costs of the facilities. The facility location problem on general graphs is NP-hard to solve optimally, by reduction from (for example) the set cover problem. A number of approximation algorithms have been developed for the facility location problem and many of its variants. Without assumptions on the set of distances between clients and sites (in particular, without assuming that the distances satisfy the triangle inequality), the problem is known as non-metric facility location and can be approximated to within a factor O(log n). This factor is tight, via an approximation-preserving reduction from the set cover problem. If we assume distances between clients and sites are undirected and satisfy the triangle inequality, we are talking about a metric facility location (MFL) problem. The MFL is still NP-hard and hard to approximate within factor better than 1.463. The currently best known approximation algorithm achieves approximation ratio of 1.488. Minimax facility location The minimax facility location problem seeks a location which minimizes the maximum distance to the sites, where the distance from one point to the sites is the distance from the point to its nearest site. A formal definition is as follows: Given a point set P ‚äÇ ‚Ñùd, find a point set S ‚äÇ ‚Ñùd, S = k, so that maxp ‚àà P(minq ‚àà S(d(p, q)) ) is minimized. In the case of the Euclidean metric for k = 1, it is known as the smallest enclosing sphere problem or 1-center problem. Its study traced at least to the year of 1860. see smallest enclosing circle and bounding sphere for more details. =NP hardness= It has been proved that exact solution of k-center problem is NP hard.. . . Approximation to the problem was found to be also NP hard when the error is small. The error level in the approximation algorithm is measured as an approximation factor, which is defined as the ratio between the approximation and the optimum. It's proved that the k-center problem approximation is NP hard when approximation factor is less than 1.822 (dimension = 2) or 2 (dimension > 2). =Algorithms= Exact solver There exist algorithms to produce exact solutions to this problem. One exact solver runs in time n^{O(\\\\sqrt{k})}. 1 + Œµ approximation 1 + Œµ approximation is to find a solution with approximation factor no greater than 1 + Œµ. This approximation is NP hard as Œµ is arbitrary. One approach based on the coreset concept is proposed with execution complexity of O(2^{O(k \\\\log k/\\\\varepsilon^2)}dn). As an alternative, another algorithm also based on coresets is available. It runs in O(k^n). The author claims that the running time is much less than the worst case and thus it's possible to solve some problems when k is small (say k < 5). Farthest-point clustering For the hardness of the problem, it's impractical to get an exact solution or precise approximation. Instead, an approximation with factor = 2 is widely used for large k cases. The approximation is referred to as the farthest-point clustering (FPC) algorithm, or farthest-first traversal. The algorithm is quite simple: pick any point from the set as one center; search for the farthest point from remaining set as another center; repeat the process until k centers are found. It is easy to see that this algorithm runs in linear time. As approximation with factor less than 2 is proved to be NP hard, FPC was regarded as the best approximation one can find. As per the performance of execution, the time complexity is later improved to O(n log k) with box decomposition technique. Maxmin facility location The maxmin facility location or obnoxious facility location problem seeks a location which maximizes the minimum distance to the sites. In the case of the Euclidean metric, it is known as the largest empty sphere problem. The planar case (largest empty circle problem) may be solved in optimal time Œò(n log n)., p. 256G. T. Toussaint, \\"Computing largest empty circles with location constraints,\\" International Journal of Computer and Information Sciences, vol. 12, No. 5, October, 1983, pp. 347‚Äì358.  Integer programming formulations  Facility location problems are often solved as integer programs. In this context, facility location problems are often posed as follows: suppose there are n facilities and m customers. We wish to choose (1) which of the n facilities to open, and (2) which (open) facilities to use to supply the m customers, in order to satisfy some fixed demand at minimum cost. We introduce the following notation: let f_i denote the (fixed) cost of opening facility i, for i=1,\\\\dots,n. Let c_{ij}denote the cost to ship a product from facility i to customer j for i=1,\\\\dots,n and j=1,\\\\dots,m. Let d_j denote the demand of customer j for j=1,\\\\dots,m. Further suppose that each facility has a maximum output. Let u_i denote the maximum amount of product that can be produced by facility i, that is, let u_i denote the capacity of facility i. The remainder of this section follows = Capacitated facility location = In our initial formulation, introduce a binary variable x_i for i=1,\\\\dots,n, where x_i=1 if facility i is open, and x_i=0 otherwise. Further introduce the variable y_{ij} for i=1,\\\\dots,n and j=1,\\\\dots,m which represents the fraction of the demand d_j filled by facility i. The so-called capacitated facility location problem is then given by\\\\begin{array}{rl} \\\\min & \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^mc_{ij} d_j y_{ij}+\\\\sum_{i=1}^nf_ix_i  \\\\text{s.t.} & \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^ny_{ij}=1 \\\\text{ for all }j=1,\\\\dots,m  & \\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_{j=1}^md_jy_{ij}\\\\leqslant u_ix_i\\\\text{ for all }i=1\\\\dots,n  &y;_{ij}\\\\geqslant0\\\\text{ for all }i=1,\\\\dots,n \\\\text{ and }j=1,\\\\dots,m &x;_i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}\\\\text{ for all } i=1,\\\\dots,n \\\\end{array} Note that the second set of constraints ensure that if x_i=0, that is, facility i isn't open, then y_{ij}=0 for all j, that is, no demand for any customer can be filled from facility i. = Uncapacitated facility location = A common case of the capacitated facility location problem above is the case when u_i=+\\\\infty for all i=1,\\\\dots,n. In this case, it is always optimal to satisfy all of the demand from customer j from the nearest open facility. Because of this, we may replace the continuous variables y_{ij} from above with the binary variables z_{ij}, where z_{ij}=1 if customer j is supplied by facility i, and z_{ij}=0 otherwise. The uncapacitated facility location problem is then given by\\\\begin{array}{rl} \\\\min & \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^mc_{ij} d_j z_{ij}+\\\\sum_{i=1}^nf_ix_i  \\\\text{s.t.} & \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^nz_{ij}=1 \\\\text{ for all }j=1,\\\\dots,m  & \\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_{j=1}^mz_{ij}\\\\leqslant Mx_i\\\\text{ for all }i=1\\\\dots,n  &z;_{ij}\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}\\\\text{ for all }i=1,\\\\dots,n \\\\text{ and }j=1,\\\\dots,m &x;_i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}\\\\text{ for all } i=1,\\\\dots,n \\\\end{array} where M is a constant chosen to be suitably large. The choice of M can affect computation results‚Äîthe best choice in this instance is obvious: take M=m. Then, if x_i=1, any choice of the z_{ij} will satisfy the second set of constraints. Another formulation possibility for the uncapacitated facility location problem is to disaggregate the capacity constraints (the big-M constraints). That is, replace the constraints\\\\sum_{j=1}^{m}z_{ij}\\\\leqslant Mx_i\\\\text{ for all }i=1,\\\\dots,nwith the constraintsz_{ij}\\\\leqslant x_i\\\\text{ for all }i=1,\\\\dots,n \\\\text{ and }j=1,\\\\dots,mIn practice, this new formulation performs significantly better, in the sense that it has a tighter Linear programming relaxation than the first formulation. Notice that summing the new constraints together yields the original big-M constraints. In the capacitated case, these formulations are not equivalent. More information about the uncapacitated facility location problem can be found in Chapter 3 of \\"Discrete location theory\\". Applications to Clustering A particular subset of cluster analysis problems can be viewed as facility location problems. In a centroid- based clustering problem, the objective is to partition n data points (elements of a common metric space) into equivalence classes‚Äîoften called colors‚Äîsuch that points of the same color are close to one another (equivalently, such that points of different colors are far from one another). To see how one might view (read \\"transform\\" or \\"reduce\\") a centroid-based clustering problem as a (metric) facility location problem, view each data point in the former as a demand point in the latter. Suppose that the data to be clustered are elements of a metric space M (e.g. let M be p -dimensional Euclidean space for some fixed p ). In the facility location problem that we are constructing, we permit facilities to be placed at any point within this metric space M ; this defines the set of allowed facility locations L . We define the costs c_{\\\\ell, d} to be the pairwise distances between location-demand point pairs (e.g., see metric k-center). In a centroid-based clustering problem, one partitions the data into k equivalence classes (i.e. colors) each of which has a centroid. Let us see how a solution to our constructed facility location problem also achieves such a partition. A feasible solution is a non-empty subset L' \\\\subseteq L of k locations. These locations in our facility location problem comprise a set of k centroids in our centroid-based clustering problem. Now, assign each demand point d to the location \\\\ell^* that minimizes its servicing-cost; that is, assign the data point d to the centroid \\\\ell^* := \\\\mathrm{arg\\\\,min}_{\\\\ell \\\\in L} \\\\\\\\{c_{\\\\ell, d}\\\\\\\\} (break ties arbitrarily). This achieves the partitioning provided that the facility location problem's costs c_{\\\\ell, d} are defined such that they are the images of the centroid-based clustering problem's distance function. The popular algorithms textbook Algorithm Design provides a related problem-description and an approximation algorithm. The authors refer to the metric facility location problem (i.e. the centroid-based clustering problem or the metric k -center problem) as the center selection problem, thereby growing the list of synonyms. Furthermore, see that in our above definition of the facility location problem that the objective function f is general. Specific choices of f yield different variants of the facility location problem, and hence different variants of the centroid-based clustering problem. For example, one might choose to minimize the sum of distances from each location to each of its assigned demand points (√† la the Weber problem), or one might elect to minimize the maximum of all such distances (√† la the 1-center problem).

Like a Grassmannian, it is a kind of moduli space, whose points correspond to certain kinds of subspaces V, specified using linear algebra, inside a fixed vector subspace W. Here W may be a vector space over an arbitrary field, though most commonly over the complex numbers. A typical example is the set X whose points correspond to those 2-dimensional subspaces V of a 4-dimensional vector space W, such that V non-trivially intersects a fixed (reference) 2-dimensional subspace W2: :X \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\\\\\{V\\\\subset W \\\\mid \\\\dim(V)=2,\\\\, \\\\dim(V\\\\cap W_2)\\\\ge 1\\\\\\\\}. Over the real number field, this can be pictured in usual xyz-space as follows. Replacing subspaces with their corresponding projective spaces, and intersecting with an affine coordinate patch of \\\\mathbb{P}(W), we obtain an open subset X¬∞ ‚äÇ X. This is isomorphic to the set of all lines L (not necessarily through the origin) which meet the x-axis. Each such line L corresponds to a point of X¬∞, and continuously moving L in space (while keeping contact with the x-axis) corresponds to a curve in X¬∞. Since there are three degrees of freedom in moving L (moving the point on the x-axis, rotating, and tilting), X is a three-dimensional real algebraic variety. However, when L is equal to the x-axis, it can be rotated or tilted around any point on the axis, and this excess of possible motions makes L a singular point of X. More generally, a Schubert variety is defined by specifying the minimal dimension of intersection between a k-dimensional V with each of the spaces in a fixed reference flag W_1\\\\subset W_2\\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset W_n=W, where \\\\dim W_j=j. (In the example above, this would mean requiring certain intersections of the line L with the x-axis and the xy-plane.) In even greater generality, given a semisimple algebraic group G with a Borel subgroup B and a standard parabolic subgroup P, it is known that the homogeneous space X = G/P, which is an example of a flag variety, consists of finitely many B-orbits that may be parametrized by certain elements of the Weyl group W. The closure of the B-orbit associated to an element w of the Weyl group is denoted by Xw and is called a Schubert variety in G/P. The classical case corresponds to G = SLn and P being the kth maximal parabolic subgroup of G.  Significance  Schubert varieties form one of the most important and best studied classes of singular algebraic varieties. A certain measure of singularity of Schubert varieties is provided by Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig polynomials, which encode their local Goresky‚ÄìMacPherson intersection cohomology. The algebras of regular functions on Schubert varieties have deep significance in algebraic combinatorics and are examples of algebras with a straightening law. (Co)homology of the Grassmannian, and more generally, of more general flag varieties, has a basis consisting of the (co)homology classes of Schubert varieties, the Schubert cycles. The study of the intersection theory on the Grassmannian was initiated by Hermann Schubert and continued by Zeuthen in the 19th century under the heading of enumerative geometry. This area was deemed by David Hilbert important enough to be included as the fifteenth of his celebrated 23 problems. The study continued in the 20th century as part of the general development of algebraic topology and representation theory, but accelerated in the 1990s beginning with the work of William Fulton on the degeneracy loci and Schubert polynomials, following up on earlier investigations of Bernstein‚ÄìGelfand‚ÄìGelfand and Demazure in representation theory in the 1970s, Lascoux and Sch√ºtzenberger in combinatorics in the 1980s, and of Fulton and MacPherson in intersection theory of singular algebraic varieties, also in the 1980s.

He and his family settled in New York City where, for the remainder of his life he was a member of the research staff of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. He was also affiliated with Yeshiva University's Holocaust studies program. According to Zachary Baker from Stanford, Dobroszycki became YIVO's \\"'research consultant to the stars'; he compiled a history of former New York mayor Ed Koch's ancestors and was a consultant to Barbra Streisand's film production of \\"Yentl\\" (an indirect Yiddish connection).

Only two of five projected volumes were published before Dr. Dobroszycki moved to New York in 1970. The first English translation of \\"The Chronicle of the Lodz Ghetto\\" was published by Yale University Press in 1984. In his review, Stefan Kanfer of Time.com reflected on the collected accounts: > \\"Within the barbed-wire boundaries a microcosm arose... Children were born, > stores were opened, a road constructed, hospitals set up, administrators > employed, records kept. It is these records, miraculously preserved in > private libraries and underground caches, that provide the first detailed > portrait of a Holocaust society.

One of the original applications of these conjectures, envisaged by Alexander Grothendieck, was to prove that his construction of pure motives gave an abelian category that is semisimple. Moreover, as he pointed out, the standard conjectures also imply the hardest part of the Weil conjectures, namely the \\"Riemann hypothesis\\" conjecture that remained open at the end of the 1960s and was proved later by Pierre Deligne; for details on the link between Weil and standard conjectures, see . The standard conjectures remain open problems, so that their application gives only conditional proofs of results. In quite a few cases, including that of the Weil conjectures, other methods have been found to prove such results unconditionally. The classical formulations of the standard conjectures involve a fixed Weil cohomology theory . All of the conjectures deal with \\"algebraic\\" cohomology classes, which means a morphism on the cohomology of a smooth projective variety : induced by an algebraic cycle with rational coefficients on the product via the cycle class map, which is part of the structure of a Weil cohomology theory. Conjecture A is equivalent to Conjecture B (see , p. 196), and so is not listed.  Lefschetz type Standard Conjecture (Conjecture B) One of the axioms of a Weil theory is the so-called hard Lefschetz theorem (or axiom): Begin with a fixed smooth hyperplane section :, where is a given smooth projective variety in the ambient projective space and is a hyperplane. Then for , the Lefschetz operator :, which is defined by intersecting cohomology classes with , gives an isomorphism :. Now, for define: : : The conjecture states that the Lefschetz operator () is induced by an algebraic cycle.  K√ºnneth type Standard Conjecture (Conjecture C) It is conjectured that the projectors : are algebraic, i.e. induced by a cycle with rational coefficients. This implies that the motive of any smooth projective variety (and more generally, every pure motive) decomposes as :h(X) = \\\\bigoplus_{i=0}^{2 dim(X)} h^i(X). The motives h^0(X) and h^{2 dim(X)} can always be split off as direct summands. The conjecture therefore immediately holds for curves. It was proved for surfaces by . have used the Weil conjectures to show the conjecture for algebraic varieties defined over finite fields, in arbitrary dimension. proved the K√ºnneth decomposition for abelian varieties A. refined this result by exhibiting a functorial K√ºnneth decomposition of the Chow motive of A such that the n-multiplication on the abelian variety acts as n^i on the i-th summand h^i(A). proved the K√ºnneth decomposition for the Hilbert scheme of points in a smooth surface.  Conjecture D (numerical equivalence vs. homological equivalence)  Conjecture D states that numerical and homological equivalence agree. (It implies in particular the latter does not depend on the choice of the Weil cohomology theory). This conjecture implies the Lefschetz conjecture. If the Hodge standard conjecture holds, then the Lefschetz conjecture and Conjecture D are equivalent. This conjecture was shown by Lieberman for varieties of dimension at most 4, and for abelian varieties.  The Hodge Standard Conjecture  The Hodge standard conjecture is modelled on the Hodge index theorem. It states the definiteness (positive or negative, according to the dimension) of the cup product pairing on primitive algebraic cohomology classes. If it holds, then the Lefschetz conjecture implies Conjecture D. In characteristic zero the Hodge standard conjecture holds, being a consequence of Hodge theory. In positive characteristic the Hodge standard conjecture is known for surfaces () and for abelian varieties of dimension 4 (). The Hodge standard conjecture is not to be confused with the Hodge conjecture which states that for smooth projective varieties over , every rational -class is algebraic. The Hodge conjecture implies the Lefschetz and K√ºnneth conjectures and conjecture D for varieties over fields of characteristic zero. The Tate conjecture implies Lefschetz, K√ºnneth, and conjecture D for ‚Ñì-adic cohomology over all fields. Permanence properties of the standard conjectures For two algebraic varieties X and Y, has introduced a condition that Y is motivated by X. The precise condition is that the motive of Y is (in Andr√©'s category of motives) expressible starting from the motive of X by means of sums, summands, and products. For example, Y is motivated if there is a surjective morphism X^n \\\\to Y. If Y is not found in the category, it is unmotivated in that context. For smooth projective complex algebraic varieties X and Y, such that Y is motivated by X, the standard conjectures D (homological equivalence equals numerical), B (Lefschetz), the Hodge conjecture and also the generalized Hodge conjecture hold for Y if they hold for all powers of X. This fact can be applied to show, for example, the Lefschetz conjecture for the Hilbert scheme of points on an algebraic surface. Relation to other conjectures has shown that the (conjectural) existence of the so-called motivic t-structure on the triangulated category of motives implies the Lefschetz and K√ºnneth standard conjectures B and C.

The school is located next to the Los Angeles International Airport, across from Westchester High School. The school's mission statement is \\"to send forth faith-filled, principled and knowledgeable young men and women by providing an exemplary college preparatory and an extra-curricular education, rooted in Roman Catholic tradition.\\" The school was founded in 1957. It is located within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Events Plans for St. Bernard High School were begun in 1955, in response to the need for high schools in the Westchester‚ÄìPlaya del Rey area. Classes were held for one year at the St. Anastasia School while the present campus was being completed. On December 4, 1957, a ceremony blessed the present site. During the 2007 and 2008 school years, the school added new computers for teachers and students. In the 2008/09 school year, a state-of-the-art video production studio was added. An Academic Success Class was developed in 2008 to ensure academic achievement for students that seem to have fallen behind in their studies. In the fall of 2008, Academic Coach training was provided to over 30 qualified juniors and seniors. The Academic Coaches work with students one-on-one and in teams during the Academic Success Class. In addition, teachers post assignments and syllabi on the school's online portal, allowing parents to access the site from any computer. In June 2009, the school hired a new principal, Mike Alvarez, a former principal of St. John Bosco High School. The 51st Graduation ceremony was held, on June 3, 2011 at The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, in light of the Class of 1961's 50th class jubilee reunion. Seventy percent of St. Bernard's 2011 graduates were accepted to four-year universities, and ninety eight percent of the class went on to attend higher learning institutes. Enrollment had doubled, greatly, from the 2010‚Äì2011 school year to the 2011‚Äì2012 school....Due to this increase, SBHS became a member of the LMU/LA: Family Of Schools. In July 2012, the school announced the appointment of co-principal, Dr. Cynthia Hoepner, who will be Co-Principal of Operations. Co-Principal Mike Alvarez will be in charge of Advancement & Campus Ministry. In the summer of 2013, Mike Alvarez resigned as co-principal making Dr. Cynthia Hoepner the school's first female principal bringing some much needed campus remodeling and upgrading such as changes to the school library, computer labs, hallways, front office/offices, and the installation of wifi.

The record stood for seven years, until it was beaten by a team from Long Beach Polytechnic High School; it still ranks as the second-best performance in the event. That year, the girls' track team‚Äîled by Miesha Withers and sisters Malika and Miya Edmonson‚Äîfinished half a point behind Long Beach Polytechnic for the overall state team title. The girls' basketball team were the 2010 Division VI Southern Section CIF Champions. In the 2010‚Äì2011 season, both the boys' and girls' teams won the Southern California Regional Division V championship and were the State Runner-up of the Southern California State Championship under first time SBHS boys' coach, Reggie Morris Jr, and girls' coach, Bo Corona. In the 2011‚Äì2012 season, the boys' basketball team were 10‚Äì0 League Champions and the first time Division V Southern Section CIF Champions in 16 years under coach Reggie Morris. St. Bernard was the 2011 Del Rey League Football Champions Varsity and JV ‚Äì 10-1 Record Seasons under first time, SBHS head coach Larry Muno. Due to the resignation of head football coach, Larry Muno and the subsequent transfer out of several of the Varsity football team members, St. Bernard did not host a Varsity Football team for the 2012 Season.

It was once abundant and widespread in the basin, its numbers and range have declined to the point where it has been listed as endangered since 1980 (ESA) and 1986 (IUCN), a fate shared by the other large Colorado basin endemic fish species like the Colorado pikeminnow, humpback chub, and razorback sucker. It is now the rarest of the endemic big-river fishes of the Colorado River. There are 20 species in the genus Gila, seven of which are found in Arizona. Description A bonytail chub can grow to long. Like many other desert fishes, its coloring tends to be darker above and lighter below, serving as a camouflage. Breeding males have red fin bases. They have a streamlined body and a terminal mouth. Bonytail chubs have bodies that sometimes arch into a smooth, predorsal hump (in adults). While their skull is quite concave, their caudal peduncle (tailside) is thin, and almost looks like a pencil (hence, ‚Äúbony tail‚Äù). The coloration of bonytail chubs is usually dark dorsally and lighter ventrally, however, in very clear waters, they looks almost black all over.Minckley, W.L. 1973. Fishes of Arizona. Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix. pp. 95-96. During breeding season, males and females have distinct coloration as well. Mature males have bright red-orange lateral bands between their paired fins; while females have a more subdued coloration that is described with the males. Range and status The bonytail chub was once found in the Colorado River basin in many U.S. states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. It also occurred in the part of the basin in Mexico, but it has been extirpated from this country. This fish species experienced the most abrupt decline of any of the long-lived fishes native to the main-stems of the Colorado River system. No remaining wild population is self-sustaining and it is functionally extinct. Its survival currently relies on release of hatchery-produced fish; several hatcheries maintain this species. Bonytail chubs were one of the first fish species to reflect the changes that occurred in the Colorado River basin after the construction of Hoover Dam; the fish was extirpated from the lower basin between 1926 and 1950.Mac, M. J., Opler, P. A., Haecker, C. E. P. and Doran, P. D., editors. 1998. Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources - Southwest. United States Geological Survey, Biological Resources Division, 986 pp. They may still be found in the Green River of Utah and perhaps in the larger Colorado River water bodies. Gila elegans was added to the US list of endangered species on April 23, 1980 and was first recognized as Endangered in 1986 by IUCN. In 2013, its IUCN status was upgraded to Critically Endangered. There is contention about the reintroduction of the bonytail chub.(18 January 2007) \\"Editorial: Fish to Fry\\" The Pueblo Chieftain Pueblo, Colorado Some are concerned about the amount of water used to increase stream flows that are required for adequate bonytail chub habitat.Baird, Joe (20 January 2006) \\"Uintah County seeks money for possible lawsuit against feds\\" The Salt Lake Tribune Salt Lake City. Utah. p. B-2 Bass fishermen are concerned about facilitating the recovery of the bonytail chub by the removal of smallmouth bass, a popular gamefish.Staff (3 May 2007) \\"Group works to control smallmouth bass, pike\\" Deseret Morning News Salt Lake City, Utah Fears of spreading the quagga mussel, an invasive species that clogs water pipelines and fouls marine equipment, has halted the reintroduction of the bonytail chub in Arizona, pending establishment of a stocking protocol that is satisfactory to Arizona wildlife officials.Rogers, Keith (17 February 2007) \\"Stocking of trout resumes at lakes\\" Las Vegas Review-Journal Las Vegas, Nevada, p. 2B Habitat Bonytail chub prefer backwaters with rocky or muddy bottoms and flowing pools, although they have been reported in swiftly moving water. They are mostly restricted to rocky canyons today but were historically abundant in the wide downstream sections of rivers. Biology Young bonytail chubs typically eat aquatic plants, while adults feed mostly on small fish, algae, plant debris, and terrestrial insects. Bonytail chubs are long-lived and may reach an age of up to 50 years. = Reproduction = Little is known about their reproductive habits, but they are thought to spawn in mid-summer and perhaps hybridize with both roundtail and humpback chubs. Spawning in Lake Mohave has been observed during May, while in the upper Green River, it occurs in the months of June and July. Eggs are laid randomly over the bottom, and no parental care occurs.  Conservation  The bonytail chub's population sizes are small, and continue to become even smaller. The depletion of the population is primarily due to the habitat alterations caused by dams and due to competition and predation by non-native fish.Bestgen, K.R., Zelasko, K.A., Compton, R.I., Chart, T.E. Survival, Condition, Habitat Use, and Predation on Stocked Bonytails (Gila elegans) in the Green River, Colorado and Utah. The Southwestern Naturalist 53(4):488-494. 2008.

Nongame field note: Bonytail Chub. Arizona Game and Fish Department, Phoenix. pp. 1‚Äì3. The Bonytail Chub Recovery Plan was approved on September 4, 1990, and refugia for the bonytail chub exist today in several places: Dexter National Fish Hatchery, New Mexico; Arizona Game and Fish Page Springs Hatchery; Ouray National Wildlife Refuge, Ouray, Utah; Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, Sasabe, Arizona; Niland Native Fish Ponds, California.

Differentiating between \\"waste oil\\" and \\"used oil\\" The U.S. EPA defines the term \\"used oil\\" as any petroleum or synthetic oil that has been used, and as a result of such use is contaminated by physical or chemical properties. \\"Used oil\\" is a precise regulatory term. \\"Waste oil\\" is a more generic term for oil that has been contaminated with substances that may or may not be hazardous. Any oil contaminated with hazardous waste may itself be a hazardous waste, and if so, must be managed subject to hazardous waste management standards. Both used oil and waste oil require proper recycling or disposal to avoid creating an environmental problem. Products used as waste oil Some examples of types of products that after use, can be labeled as used oil are: hydraulic oil, transmission oil, brake fluids, motor oil, crankcase oil, gear box oil, synthetic oil,State of Maine (www.maine.gov) and grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 fuel oil. Disposal of waste oil Waste oil can be disposed of in different ways, including sending the used oil off-site (some facilities are permitted to handle the used oil such as your local garages and local waste disposal facilities), burning used oil as a fuel (some used oil is not regulated by burner standards, but others that are off-specification used oil can only be burned in either industrial furnaces, certain boilers, and permitted hazardous waste incinerators), and marketing the used oil (claims are made that the used oil is to be burned for energy recovery, and then it is shipped to a used oil burner who burns the used oil in an approved industrial furnace or boiler). Oils that are off-specification typically contain: Arsenic 5 ppm, Cadmium 2 ppm, Chromium 10 ppm, Lead 100 ppm, Flash point 100¬∞F, minimum (i.e., FP must be greater than 100¬∞F), Total Halogens >4,000 ppm Storage and handling of waste oil For on-site burning of used oil, the oil must be stored in tanks or containers, above or underground. The containers must be in good condition with no leaks, the tanks/containers must be labeled with the words ‚Äúused oil‚Äù, and there must be a spill prevention plan (or a control and countermeasures plan). =Used Oil Management= In 1984 the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) implemented a used oil management program under Sections 403.75 through 403.769, Florida Statutes. Florida‚Äôs Used Oil Recycling Program has grown to become one of the most successful in the United States and has received national recognition. =Waste oil furnaces and boilers= Waste oil furnace is a type of furnace used for heating purposes and is fueled by used oil that is free of hazardous contaminants, as described by the EPA. Waste-oil-fueled boilers can be used for various industrial purposes as well as heating.

Hudock began his career in Major League Soccer, playing primarily for the Seattle Sounders, before moving to the Charleston Battery of the A-League and USL First Division. Career =Youth and college= Hudock grew up in Phoenix, Arizona and played youth soccer for CISCO Arsenal. He played at the University of Washington from 1991 to 1993, where he was named to the All American Second Team in 1992 and 1993.1992 All Americans 1993 All Americans He was also a member of the US soccer team at the 1991 World Student Games held in Sheffield. At some point during his collegiate career, Hudock also played for the Tucson Amigos of the USISL.Local fans kick up heels for Desert Cup soccer =Professional= Hudock initially began playing soccer at the college level at the University of Washington, until turning professional by signing with the Seattle Sounders of the A-League in 1994. During his tenure with the Sounders, he primarily served as a backup for then starting goalie Marcus Hahnemann which resulted in minimal appearances for the young goalkeeper. Despite not recording much minutes on the field, he did receive his first piece of silverware as Seattle would become the A-League Champions in 1995. In 1996, the Colorado Rapids drafted Hudock in the second round of the 1996 MLS Inaugural Player Draft. At Colorado, he received the chance to experience being a starter during the commence of earlier part of the season, but was soon after replaced by Chris Woods, and returned to Seattle in 1997. Ironically soon after his release from Colorado, the club would sign his former teammate Hahnemann as his successor, which allowed Hudock to complete for a starting goalkeeper position in Seattle. Hudock superb performances during the 1997 campaign resulted in him to be awarded the A-League Goalkeeper of the Year award. After an exceptional showing at Seattle led him to be sign by the Chicago Fire on a loan, where it got Hudock a MLS championship. In April 1998, he went on loan with the Colorado Rapids., COLORADO CALLS IN FORMER RAPIDS KEEPER DUSTY HUDOCK FOR D.C. UNITED GAME SATURDAY while a late call-up during the playoffs by the Chicago Fire got Hudock an MLS championship ring as he was on the bench in the final. During the time of the 1999 MLS draft it was presumed by many that Tampa Bay Mutiny would sign Hudock, but instead the team signed Scott Garlick. Dusty entered the MLS Draft and was picked up by the Miami Fusion. Hudock started the first three games of the season until usual starter Jeff Cassar returned from injury. Fusion waived Hudock, and he signed with the Charleston Battery on April 15, 1999. In Charleston he earned a reputation for being a prime goalkeeper and an outstanding shot-stopper. His immense contributions brought Charleston to a great level of prestige among the league. During his tenure at Charleston he has established himself as the all-time leading goalkeeper for the Battery with 130 wins and a GAA of 1.08. His Battery records include 91 shutouts and 260 games started. He assisted the club by claiming their second A-League Championship and several Division titles; he was awarded for the second time in his career A-League Goalkeeper of the Year award in 2002. In February, 2010 he was ranked 16th in the USL First Division Top 25 of the Decade, which announced a list of the best and most influential players of the previous decade. In 2000, he posted a career high season by recording 17 victories under his belt, as well receiving his first piece of silverware by winning the Division title. His 2002 season was exceptional, as he managed to finish as the league's leading goalkeeper with 13 shutouts that resulted in a GAA of 0.60. His remarkable season led to him being awarded the A-League Goalkeeper of the Year award, as well receiving the majority of his domestic club's team awards. Hudock would experience a tremendous season with Charleston in 2003, where he provided a pivotal role in the club's championship season. He recorded 11 shutouts that clinched the Southeast Division title and provided a playoff berth for the Battery. In the club's playoff round, Hudock posted three consecutive shutouts against the likes of the Rochester Rhinos, and including the final match against the Minnesota Thunder, which culminated in a 3-0 A-League Championship victory. For his dedication the club honoured him with the Charleston Battery MVP award for the second consecutive year in a row. The following season, Charleston produced a mediocre season because the majority of its championship winning squad went overseas to pursue new opportunities. Despite not making the post season, he led the club to the semifinals of the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup. In 2005, Hudock would pursue other club offers eventually signing with the Rochester Rhinos. His tenure at Rochester met an unfavorable run for the goalkeeper, where he would primarily serve as a substitute to Scott Vallow. This prompted a return to South Carolina in 2006, where he was appointed club captain and once again played an important role in Charleston entry into the playoffs. In 2008, Hudock was part of the Charleston squad that made history in the US Open Cup, by becoming the second USL club in the MLS era of the tournament to reach the tournament championship, where their opponents were D.C. United. Unfortunately in the final, D.C. United came away with a 2-1 victory.

Although the album was released on April 16, 2007 in Europe, and the following day worldwide, the game had been underway since roughly February 12, 2007 and was expected to continue for approximately eighteen months. The game was created by 42 Entertainment, the same group responsible for the Halo 2 promotional alternative reality game I Love Bees. Trent Reznor, frontman and sole member of the band, has called the game \\"a new entertainment form\\". In response to criticism regarding the promotion of the album, Reznor stated: Premise An Art is Resistance flier from the Year Zero ARG. Reznor said that Year Zero is a concept album, \\"could be about the end of the world\\", and marked a \\"shift in direction\\" in that it \\"doesn't sound like With Teeth.\\" The 2006 tour merchandise designs featured overt references to the United States military, which \\"reflects future directions.\\" In an interview with Gigwise.com, Reznor stated that the concept behind Year Zero was partially inspired by his feelings toward the Bush administration. He further explained, > I really wanted to focus on something that was at the forefront of my > consciousness which is, as an American, I'm appalled by the behavior of our > government, the direction that it has taken and the direction that it's > taken everyone else in the world and its arrogance... I decided to write an > essay about where the world might be if we continue down the path that we're > on with a neo-con-esque government doing whatever it pleases... To this end, the storyline of Year Zero borrows heavily from such well-known dystopian fiction as George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (government surveillance), Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (use of drugs to subdue the populace), Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (large-scale censorship and uniformism), and Yevgeny Zamyatin's We (synthesis of church and state). Specific plot elements bear a resemblance to the Philip K. Dick short story Faith of Our Fathers, including hallucinogens in the water supply, an oppressive, heavily militaristic state, aggressive government monitoring of the populace, and a venerated entity which manifests in many forms. In keeping with the dystopian theme, Year Zero takes place in 2022, the same year as the 1973 film Soylent Green. Plot The story takes place in the United States in the year 2022, which has been termed \\"Year 0\\" by the US government, being the year that America was reborn. The U.S. had suffered several major terrorist attacks, including attacks on Los Angeles and Seattle. In response, the government granted itself emergency powers and seized absolute control on the country. The U.S. government is now a Christian fundamentalist theocracy, maintaining control of the populace through institutions like the Bureau of Morality and the First Evangelical Church of Plano, and locked into near constant war abroad against their aggressors, with the implied ulterior motive to expand their spheres of influence. Americans must get licenses to marry, bear children, etc. Subversive activities can result in these licenses being revoked. Dissenters regularly disappear from their homes in the night, and are detained in federal detainment centers and sanitariums, if not executed. The government corporation Cedocore distributes the drug Parepin through the water supply, under the guise of it being an \\"immune booster\\" to prevent future bioterrorism attacks. However, Parepin is actually a psychoactive drug, engineered to reduce aggression, affect memory retention, and instill great credulity toward authority. As a result, most Americans who drink the water become apathetic and carefree; in addition, side effects such as schizophrenia-like behavior, muscle twitches, anorgasmia are implied to have effective treatment only in urban and developed areas, discouraging people moving to rural and remote areas with untreated water. There are several underground rebel groups, mainly operating online, most notably Art is Resistance and Solutions Backwards Initiative. The First Evangelical Church of Plano is a fundamentalist Protestant Christian church which is favored, and implied to be funded, by the neo-conservative government. Amidst all of this are increasing sightings of what is labelled \\"The Presence\\", which manifests as a pair of massive ghostly hands and arms extending down from the sky into the ground. Despite early attributions of The Presence to drug-induced mass hysteria, it soon becomes clear that it is a physical phenomenon capable of being recorded on video and film, although grainy and unfocused. Theories vary on the real cause of the appearances, but the prevailing opinion appears to be that the hands represent God or some other equivalent supernatural force. The sightings become more and more frequent, and those who are \\"touched\\" by the hand begin to report their experiences, mostly of a feeling of terror and clarity. On February 10, 2022, a government official named Doug is in his office tracking The Presence, while missing the birth of his daughter in Denver. He begins writing a letter to his then-unborn child, describing the state of the world and his family. Doug continually references The Presence, as more and more sightings are suddenly reported all around the planet at once. He says goodbye to his child, as the letter ends with a frantic, broken message that the Presence is above the Capitol Building and \\"the stars are going out like candles\\". It cuts off suddenly, implying reports that sightings of the phenomenon are rapidly being reported from all over the world. The sequence ends with a broken message announcing the appearance of The Presence over the United States Capitol Building. The message cuts off suddenly, implying the end of the world. Meanwhile, the Solutions Backwards Initiative - a group of students, professors, and computer experts - devise a successful means with which to send information back through time using quantum mechanics in order to prevent the dystopian future (and eventual apocalypse) they live in from ever occurring. The websites and music of the Year Zero alternate reality game are implied to be part of the information packets sent back through the wormholes, activated only moments after Doug's message. Media attention The concept behind the Year Zero alternate reality game, as well as avid fan participation in the game, has caught the attention of the media numerous times; USA Today and Rolling Stone have cited fan site The NIN Hotline, forum Echoing the Sound, fan club The Spiral, and NinWiki as sources for new discoveries. Film and television project In March 2007 Kerrang! Radio reported that \\"Reznor admitted he's already in talks about a movie version of his upcoming album a concept piece, with part two scheduled for next year.\\" He had earlier noted Year Zero as \\"part of a bigger picture of a number of things I'm working on. Essentially, I wrote the soundtrack to a movie that doesn't exist.\\" Reznor has commented that he is currently more interested in a television project than a film project. He has stated that he has a producer and has met with writers. On August 10, 2007, Reznor announced that they would soon be taking the concept to television networks in an attempt to secure a deal. \\"We're about to pitch it to the network, so we're a couple of weeks away from meeting all of the main people, and we'll see what happens.\\" Since first announcing his plans for a television series, progress has slowed, reportedly due to the 2007‚Äì2008 Writer's Guild strike. Despite this, Reznor has reported that the project is \\"still churning along\\". Reznor clarified in November 2012 that the project was \\"currently in a holding state\\" due to himself and Rob Sheridan failing to \\"find the right match with a writer\\". In 2017, during an interview promoting new Nine Inch Nails EP Add Violence, Reznor said that \\"They got so far as hiring a writer for it, but then it fell to shit because we never had the right writer. I should have just done it [myself].\\" Critical reception Many reviewers of the Year Zero album also commented on the accompanying game. Ann Powers of The Los Angeles Times praised the album and game concept as \\"a total marriage of the pop and gamer aesthetics that unlocks the rusty cages of the music industry and solves some key problems facing rock music as its cultural dominance dissolves into dust.\\" In 2008, 42 Entertainment won two Webby Awards for their work on the Year Zero game, under the categories of \\"Integrated Campaigns\\" and \\"Other Advertising: Branded Content\\". 42 Entertainment was also awarded three medals in The One Show's entertainment award ceremony, including a gold medal in the \\"online gaming\\" category, a silver in the \\"music\\" category, and a merit award in the \\"online branded entertainment\\" category.

The date of the masque's performance at the English Court has long been in dispute: while the earliest text assigns it to 1625, mid-twentieth-century scholars placed it on 19 June 1620,Logan and Smith, pp. 87‚Äì8. the king's birthday, at the royal palace at Greenwich. More recently, Martin Butler has argued for a date of 6 January 1621. The show The masque is set in Arcadia, in a classical pastoral setting, and opens with three nymphs and an elderly shepherd. They are quickly joined by a fencer, who engages the shepherd in a long discussion. The point of this dialogue is to portray the fencer, and the martial spirit he represents, as exaggerated and rather clownish, in keeping with the pacifistic orientation of King James I.Hardin Aasand, \\"'Sed Pater et Filius Unum Fictione Iuris Sunt:' Oberon and the Masque of Succession,\\" in Rutledge, p. 193. The two anti-masques feature Boeotians and Thebans (Grecian Thebes was the capital of Boeotia), while the masque proper reveals the principal masquers clustered around a \\"fountain of light\\" before they descend to dance. The intended contrast was between the pastoral peace and simplicity of Arcadia and the warlike spirit of Thebes. (The musicians who provided the accompaniment were costumed as priests of Pan.) Jonson experimented with an unusual structure in this work, placing the anti-masques both before and after the main masque. James was hailed and praised in the guise of Pan. One critic has categorized it this way: \\"Exquisitely artificial though the masque may formally be, it is infused with the colors, scents, and sounds of a very concrete natural world.\\"Torrance, p. 842. A more jaded view is that the work \\"is a competent but not particularly exciting masque.\\"Salzman, p. 109. Publication Jonson's text for Pan's Anniversary was first published in the second folio collection of Jonson's works in 1641, though it was mis-dated to 1625 and placed out of the proper chronological order of the masques in that volume. The title page for the work is unique among Jonson's masques in placing Inigo Jones's name before Jonson's. Some of Jones's designs for the masque's sets survive; they consist, unsurprisingly, of forest and mountain scenes typical of the pastoral form. Modern production Pan's Anniversary is one of the rare masques from the early Stuart era to have received a twentieth-century production. An April 1905 production at Stratford-upon-Avon, part of a Shakespeare Birthday Celebration, featured incidental music composed by Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams,Kenndy, p. 64. and a student performance was given at Columbia University Teachers' College on 27 April 1916.

They are large snakes; adults may attain a total length of . Description 'Boiga nigriceps' (subadult) in Khao Luang National Park, Thailand It gets its name from the greenish to blackish coloration of its head. Neonates and juveniles do not exhibit this dark color on the head until adulthood. The body color ranges greatly from brown, orange, red, and even black. The ventral region of the snake is yellowish below the neck and white for the rest. Subspecies Two subspecies are recognized: * Boiga nigriceps nigriceps (G√ºnther, 1863) * Boiga nigriceps brevicauda Smith, 1926 Distribution Indonesia, Borneo, Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand. Habitat The black-headed cat snake is arboreal, but frequently comes down to the ground in search of prey. They occupy lowland and mid-elevation tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. Venom Little is known about the black- headed cat snake's venom toxicity on humans, but it is thought to be comparable to the severity of a copperhead. This rear fanged colubrid's bite rarely results in adverse effects due to its poor venom delivery system. Luckily their fangs' positioning doesn't result in any significant envenomation. Symptoms tend to stay localized to the envenomation site, limiting the victim to minor pain. Diet The black-headed cat snake feeds on lizards, frogs, birds, small mammals and other snakes in the wild.

South Saddle was originally known as simply Saddle Mountain but in 1983 officially became South Saddle Mountain to avoid confusion with Saddle Mountain to the north in Clatsop County.  Geology  Origins of the mountain begin in around 40 million years ago during the Eocene age when sandstone and siltstone formed in the region consisting of parts of the Northern Oregon Coast Range. Igneous rocks and basalt flows combined with basaltic sandstone to create much of the formations. Other sedimentary rock in the area formed more recently, around 20 million years ago. It is hypothesized that the region was an island during the Eocene era.  Area and access  A golden-crowned kinglet. The lower peak houses a microwave transmission tower, while the lower parts of the mountain are popular for bird watchers and off-road motorcycle enthusiasts. This tower includes amateur radio repeaters and an AT&T; microwave transmitter. Surrounding the mountain are forests of western hemlock and Douglas fir trees. Fauna in the area include a variety of birds such as hermit warbler, sooty grouse, chestnut-backed chickadee, golden-crowned kinglet, Steller's jay, and Pacific-slope flycatcher.

He is also the founder of the record label Brainfeeder. Flying Lotus has released six studio albums1983 (2006), Los Angeles (2008), Cosmogramma (2010), Until the Quiet Comes (2012), You're Dead! (2014), and Flamagra (2019)to critical acclaim. He has produced much of the bumper music on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block. He also contributed remixes for fellow Plug Research artists including Mia Doi Todd. In 2012, Ellison began rapping under the persona Captain Murphy, based on the Sealab 2021 character of the same name. Ellison kept this fact a secret for several months, finally revealing his identity several weeks after the release of his first rap mixtape, Duality.  Early life and education Flying Lotus was born Steven Ellison on October 7, 1983, in Los Angeles, California. He is the grand-nephew of the late jazz pianist Alice Coltrane, whose husband was saxophonist John Coltrane. Additionally, he is the grandson of singer- songwriter Marilyn McLeod, who is notable for having written Diana Ross's \\"Love Hangover\\" and Freda Payne's \\"I Get High (On Your Memory)\\" and is Alice Coltrane's sister. McLeod has been called by one writer \\"the biggest influence on Ellison's music\\". A DNA test revealed that Ellison descended from the Tikar people of Cameroon. Ellison attended Los Angeles Film School and Academy of Art University.  Musical career  =2006‚Äì07: Adult Swim, 1983 and Warp Records= In 2006, while at his mother's house, Ellison saw an advertisement on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block asking for song submissions. He sent some in, under the name Flying Lotus (a moniker inspired by lucid dreaming) and was accepted. Around this time, he was interning at the pioneering hip hop label Stones Throw Records. He released his debut studio album 1983 on October 3, 2006. The album helped him develop his eclectic creative mission, forging compressed, spacey and Eastern sounding hip-hop beats, that summoned Madlib as much as Dntel, while sampling as far back as 70s Japanese proto-synthpop and 60s jazz harp. In 2006, Ellison participated in that year's annual Red Bull Music Academy, which took place in Melbourne, Australia. In 2007, he announced on CSU-Fullerton‚Äôs Titan Radio that he signed with Warp Records. He released his debut EP, the six-track Reset on October 1, 2007. Soon afterwards, he became one of the label's cornerstone artists and released his second studio album, Los Angeles on June 10, 2008. =2008‚Äì09: Los Angeles and Brainfeeder= In 2008 Flying Lotus released Los Angeles, a 17-track album dedicated to his home city. Telling Quietus on the subject of J Dilla's influence on his music: \\"I love Dilla and who knows where this beat thing would be without him. His work ethic inspired so many producers around the world, but when he moved out to LA, it seemed that his presence here inspired everyone to kick things into overdrive. If I had to describe his music, I'd say it were 'imaginative soul music'. I think it's his imagination that appeals to me, personally. Dilla could flip a boring record and make you feel like you were flying.\\" 2008 saw Ellison enter a stage of hyper- productivity, as he followed up the Los Angeles record with collaborative tracks with Samiyam and Gonjasufi, a limited white label run of remixes (\\"Camel\\", \\"Lightworks\\", R2-D2 sound effects, \\"Shadows of Tomorrow\\" and \\"Promiscuous\\") called Shhh!, and a series of LA inspired EPs. Each of the La EPs features remixes and unreleased tracks from his Los Angeles Album. The third in that series (titled L.A. EP 3 X 3), marked a new atmospheric style in his sound. The same year, Flying Lotus also remixed \\"Reckoner\\" from Radiohead's album In Rainbows. =2010‚Äì11: Cosmogramma and collaborations= His third studio album, Cosmogramma, was released in the UK on May 3, 2010, and in the US on May 4, 2010. In January 2011, Cosmogramma won in the Dance/Electronica Album category in the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards. The multi-award-winning Cosmogramma was a hard-hitting afrofuturistic shrine to soul, hip-hop, jazz and IDM but, with more emphasis on a lyrical message than ever before, it was also a cathartic grieving experience. The album was accompanied by live instrumentation (Thundercat on bass, Miguel Atwood Ferguson on strings, Rebekah Raff on harp) and live vocalists (Thom Yorke, Laura Darlington) ‚Äì all picked to help communicate the spiritual musical lineage of Ellison‚Äôs family (Ravi Coltrane, himself, played tenor sax). Stephen Bruner, aka Thundercat, who is featured extensively on Cosmogramma, would later become a large part of future albums by Flying Lotus. In 2010, Flying Lotus collaborated with the Ann Arbor Film Festival in the performance of a live scoring of the 1962 avant-garde film Heaven and Earth Magic. In a post-viewing interview with the audience, Flying Lotus said that he was unsure whether or not a recording of the performance (or a recreation of it) would be publicly released, but he would be enthusiastic toward similar projects in the future. He was chosen by Battles to perform at the ATP Nightmare Before Christmas festival that it co-curated in December 2011 in Minehead, England, UK. In September 2010, Flying Lotus released \\"Pattern+Grid World\\", an 8 track EP featuring Thundercat on bass & art by Theo Ellsworth. The Track Camera Day was used in the Killer Mike song Swimming, which was released as part of the Adult Swim Singles Series. In January 2011, Flying Lotus won the 10th Annual Independent Music Awards for his video \\"MmmHmm\\" in the Short-Form Video category. It was reported in 2011 that Flying Lotus would be collaborating with R&B; singer Erykah Badu on new material for her next album, and planned to remix one of Radiohead's songs from The King of Limbs. =2012‚Äì13: Until the Quiet Comes and Captain Murphy= Flying Lotus performing at the 2012 Bonnaroo Music Festival With an appreciation for hip hop, but no established work, artists like Odd Future (also aficionados of Adult Swim), A$AP Mob, Spaceghostpurrp and Shabazz Palaces inspired him to directly participate, and he began production work for Odd Future‚Äôs Hodgy Beats‚Äô Untitled EP. This led to the moment in which he decided to produce more in the genre: \\"I can recall the moment specifically ... [Odd Future] started playing me some of The OF Tape Vol. 2. ... I asked them, 'Yo, Hodgy, how long did it take you to record this shit? How long did it take you to write this song?' 'Aw, my nigga, it took me like 15 minutes.‚Äô 15 minutes? Are you fucking serious? I was like, 'Nah, nigga. I am gonna do this shit.'\\"https://pitchfork.com/news/49132-flying-lotus-gives-first-interview- about-captain-murphy-working-on-new-material/ Throughout the summer of 2012, Captain Murphy began to make more appearances, dressed in Luchadore Ensemble. In August 2012, Flying Lotus announced a multimedia project with filmmaker Miwa Matreyek, which is to be titled The Mapping of Countries Yet to Come. Flying Lotus produced rapper Mac Miller's song \\"SDS‚Äô\\" for his album Watching Movies with the Sound Off. He also created a song for the Cartoon Network series Adventure Time entitled \\"About that time//A glitch is a glitch\\". Behind closed doors though, the work for his fourth album Until the Quiet Comes was pretty much done. A year prior, Ellison had worked with Ann Arbor Festival to live score a surreal and avant-garde 50s animation Heaven and Earth Magic (pictured below), and a fascination with dreamlike states had continued into this record. Until The Quiet Comes continued his creative relationship with Radiohead's Thom Yorke, as well as Jonny Greenwood, Niki Randa, Erykah Badu, Laura Darlington and, of course, Thundercat, and was cinematically captured in a short film by Kahlil Joseph. In late 2012, less than two months after the release of his last record, a website started circulating online: www.captainmurphy.xxx. Press speculated who the rapper was, with guessing being centered around the Odd Future Crew. The site hosted Duality, a 34-minute short film mixtape, that comprised both new material and tracks that had been leaking all summer. In April 2013, Flying Lotus announced that he has his own radio station called FlyLo FM in the video game Grand Theft Auto V, saying there would be \\"a ton of new songs and information, including rapping a new Captain Murphy song produced by Hudson Mohawke\\".

He was born and died in Antwerp. His father was the sculptor Jan Mertens the Elder, whose family is thought to have originated in Tournai. Mertens the Younger was apprenticed to the painter Jan Gossaert in 1505, and he became a master of the Antwerp painters' guild in 1509. He was the father-in-law (and perhaps teacher) of Pieter Coecke van Aelst, who married Mertens‚Äôs daughter Anna before 1526, and whose work has been used as the basis for the identification of Mertens with the Master of 1518, an Antwerp painter named after the date inscribed on the painted wings of a carved wooden altarpiece of the Life of the Virgin in St. Mary's Church, L√ºbeck. The sharp focus, lively narrative and exaggerated poses evident in the painted wings in L√ºbeck are characteristic of Antwerp Mannerism, but Mertens‚Äôs work is distinguished by its brilliant color, sense of structure, thoughtful composition and delicacy of style. Mertens formed an important link in the artistic dynasties of Antwerp, for his second daughter married first Jan van Amstel, now usually identified with The Brunswick Monogrammist, and subsequently Gillis van Coninxloo.

Structure Sonnet 132 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form abab cdcd efef gg and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 3rd line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Have put on black and loving mourners be, (132.3) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Line 13 features a mid-line reversal and, potentially, an initial reversal: / √ó √ó / / √ó √ó / √ó / Then will I swear beauty herself is black, (132.13) Lines 2, 4, and 6 also exhibit initial reversals. Line 6 may be scanned as exhibiting a mid-line reversal; such a reversal is normally preceded by at least a slight intonational break, which \\"grey cheeks\\" does not allow. Peter Groves calls this a \\"harsh mapping\\", and recommends that in performance \\"the best thing to do is to prolong the subordinated S-syllable [here, \\"grey\\"] ... the effect of this is to throw a degree of emphasis on it\\". Some rhythmic uncertainty at the beginning of lines 7 and 9 may be resolved by applying contrastive accent to line 7's \\"that\\" and line 9's \\"those\\", rendering both lines regular and foregrounding a characteristically Shakespearean antithetical construction. The meter demands that line 1's \\"pitying\\" function as two syllables. Regarding lines 5 and 7's rhymes \\"heaven\\" and \\"even\\", Booth regards them as monosyllabic, whereas Kerrigan evidently reads them as disyllabic.

It is one of the most common pastries in Hong Kong. Overseas, however, it is much more rare in Chinatown bakery shops. It is made from rice flour, white sugar, water, and a leavening agent. While it is called a \\"cake\\", it is not served as a circular round cake. It is usually purchased as an individual square piece or a mini triangle. The cake is white in color, with a spongy and soft consistency. The taste is sweet, and sometimes has a slightly sour taste due to fermentation of the batter prior to cooking. Like most Chinese cakes, it is steamed, giving it a moist, soft, and fluffy texture, as opposed to a dry and firm one. If left exposed to the air, it hardens quickly. It is usually kept under some cover to preserve moistness. It is typically served hot, because when it is cold it is not as soft and moist. The batter is either poured over a bowl in a steamer, a Chinese steamer cloth or aluminum foil. If made from brown rice flour and brown sugar it is called a brown sugar sponge cake. A Vietnamese version of the cake, called b√°nh b√≤, differs from the Chinese version in that it often uses coconut milk as an ingredient, and does not have the sourness that often typifies the Chinese version.

Eventually open hostilities between the Thirty and disenfranchised or disaffected Athenian citizens led to a coup d'etat in 403 BC that deposed them.

According to some critics he is also the subject of another of Lysias' speech, On the Murder of Eratosthenes (Speech 1). However, the age of the Tyrant does not fit with the context of the latter speech: he must have been aged at least 18 in 411 BC to have served as a trierarch, and at least 30 by the time of the Thirty Tyrants period in 403/2 BC.

Towery Sr. (1916‚Äì1996) in his southwest Amarillo home, and was sentenced to death by 251st state District Judge Patrick Pirtle. The victim had been stabbed nearly 60 times with such weapons as a paring knife, a butcher knife, a grapefruit knife and a fork. He also suffered blunt trauma to the head from a hammer, and a foot-long lamp pole had been shoved more than five inches (127 mm) down his throat.Offender Information - Holberg, Brittany Murder trial Mountain View Unit, where Holberg is held Holberg was working as a topless dancer and was hired by Towery. During the trial, defense attorney Catherine Brown Dodson argued that Towery was wrongly portrayed as an innocent elderly man, and that Holberg acted in self-defense when Towery attacked her. Dodson said A.B. Towery became angry and violent when he found a crack pipe on Holberg. She told the jury that Towery struck Holberg twice in the head with a metal pan while her back was turned, and then threatened her with a knife. Holberg reacted by stabbing him with her own knife, and the fight escalated until Holberg put the lamp post in his mouth to attempt to end the struggle. Holberg believed she would have little legal recourse because of her status as a drug-abusing prostitute and fled to Tennessee.Canyon jury asks for death penalty against Brittany Holberg Testimony showed that A.B. Towery, the victim, also had a problem with drugs. Holberg filed an appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas (No. 73,127), but on November 29, 2000, the appeals court upheld the decision of the trial court.Holberg v State In 2015 James Farren, the district attorney of Randall County, stated that due to the legal complications involving the Holberg case and the resulting legal expenses‚Äîhe estimated the cost was about $400,000‚Äîand time expended, he would pursue life imprisonment without parole for future capital murder cases unless exceptional circumstances occur.Kanelis, John. \\"Holberg capital case still causing headaches\\" (Archive).

A right-handed batsman who could play aggressively, but with a sound defensive method, Roe was considered one of Somerset's leading batsmen of the era. He played without merit for Cambridge, and only achieved his Blue during his final year at the university. Roe gained cricketing fame in the summer of 1881, when he was drafted into the Emmanuel College Long Vacation Club cricket team for their match against a similar team from Gonville and Caius. After Caius had scored 100 runs, Roe batted for the rest of the game to reach 415 runs, the highest score in cricket at the time, just passing the previous total of 404 by Edward Tylecote. The match was reported across the contemporary press, though it was stressed that the quality of the opposition bowling was weak. Roe's first-class career never reached the heights it might have done; he was generally an inconsistent scorer, and scored just four hundreds in first-class cricket. His struggles were mirrored by his county side, Somerset, who flitted between first- and second-class cricket during his career. He played for the county from 1879 until 1899, and scored 2,690 runs in all first-class matches. Life and education career William Nichols Roe was born on 21 March 1861 in Closworth, near Yeovil, in south Somerset. He attended the Clergy Orphan School in Canterbury before being admitted to Magdalene College, Cambridge in 1879. He graduated from Cambridge with a BA in 1883, and took a position as an schoolmaster at Elstree School, in Hertfordshire, from 1883 to 1900. He left Elstree in 1901 to set up Stanmore Park preparatory school with former England Test cricketer Vernon Royle. In 1892 he married Zoe Susanna Charlotte Jennings Crew Crew,Hill 2016, pp. 54‚Äì55. and the pair had a son, also named William Nichols Roe, in 1898. Roe (senior) died on 11 October 1937, aged 76, in a nursing home in Marylebone, London following an operation. Cricket career =Early cricket= Roe had been a dominant cricketer during his time at school; in three years at the Clergy Orphan School, he took 292 wickets at a bowling average of eight, scored over 1,000 runs in 1878, and took all ten wickets in an innings against Chartham Asylum during his final year. In 1879, before going up to Cambridge University, Roe played four times for Somerset County Cricket Club. By his own recollections, he recounts his first experience of county cricket as being bowled by W. G. Grace \\"neck and crop\\". Originally published in In two trial matches for the Cambridge University Cricket Club, Roe impressed a little; in the freshman's match he was dismissed twice for single figure scores, and was little used as a bowler. In the trial match between the first team and the \\"next fifteen\\", he once again struggled in the first innings, but improved in the second, scoring 44 runs. He made his first-class cricket debut a few days after the second of those matches, appearing for the university side against an England XI. The university fared badly in the match, with no batsman reaching double figures in the first innings, and only four managing it in the second. Roe was dismissed for four and two, and did not play for the university again that year. =Highest score in cricket= In the second half of the 19th century, high scores in cricket matches were becoming more common as pitches improved, and in the summer of 1880, Roe gave a prelude to his record breaking of the following year when he hit 223 in a one-day match against his former school. In competitive, albeit second-class, county cricket, his scores remained significantly lower. Nor did he impress in the trial matches at Cambridge in his second year, resulting in him not appearing for the university that season. In 1868, Edward Tylecote had become the first batsman to score a quadruple century (400 runs) in cricket, when he accumulated 404 not out in an internal match at Clifton College. W. G. Grace had got close to the total in 1876, but ran out of batting partners to finish on 400 not out. In the summer of 1881, Roe achieved his fame, by surpassing them both. In an intercollegiate match between the \\"long vacation clubs\\" of Gonville and Caius and Emmanuel, Roe was called upon as a guest player for Emmanuel, who had only managed to find nine players. Caius batted first, and were dismissed for 100 runs exactly, Roe taking half of their wickets and Charles Allcock the other half. Roe and Allcock then proceeded to open the batting for Emmanuel, finishing the day on 157 without the loss of either batsman. The next afternoon Roe reached his century early, and then after scoring 200 runs he could have been out three times, but each chance was missed. Against bowling described in the contemporary press as weak, he batted through the rest of the day to finish on 415 not out. The game was played on a ground with no boundaries, so he had to run each of his team's 708 runs, a distance of nearly eight miles. In all, he scored 1 six, 6 fives, 16 fours, 48 threes, 52 twos and 67 ones, but so fastidious was Roe, that when he came off the field at the close of play, he challenged the scorer for crediting him one run short; Roe had counted 416 runs. Roe's record was beaten by James Stewart Carrick in 1885, when the latter scored 419 not out for the West of Scotland against Priory Park, Chichester. =University and county cricketer= Magdalene College, Cambridge, which Roe attended in the 1880s. In Haygarth's Cricket Scores and Biographies, Roe is described as a \\"fine, free hitter with excellent defence\\", who could also \\"bowl a very useful medium-paced ball\\".Ashley-Cooper & Haygarth 2004, p. 330. He got more of a go at Cambridge during his third year, playing five matches for the university side in 1882. Roe, who was known for his cricket tales, related a tale from one match that season in which the weather was so cold that catches were difficult to take. George Nash, the Lancashire professional, was missed off every ball of an over from Robert Ramsay. \\"C. T. Studd bowled the next ball, and a catch came to me at mid-off, the crowd began to boo, and I felt certain I should not make the catch, but by great good fortune the ball stuck!\\" Roe did not excel with bat or ball in any of his five university matches, and was not selected for the match against Oxford University at the end of the season. In his final year at Cambridge, Roe played seven times for the university, and achieved his Blue‚Äîthe awarding of the Cambridge \\"colours\\" to sportsmen‚Äîby appearing in the University match against Oxford. He was out without scoring any runs in his only innings of the match, which Cambridge won by seven wickets. In all, during his time at Cambridge, Roe played 13 first-class matches for the university, scoring 246 runs at an average of 11.18, with just one score greater than 50. He also took ten wickets at 15.60. Roe was rated as being one of Somerset better batsmen in their early years of first-class cricket, but his form in club cricket did not translate into good performances for the county. Between 1881 and 1882, Roe scored thirteen centuries, but none of those came in county cricket. In fact, it was not until 1884 that he made his first hundred in first-class cricket, scoring 132 against Hampshire. His work as a schoolmaster limited his availability for Somerset, and he only played three first-class matches for them in each of 1884 and 1885. After the 1885 season, Somerset were stripped of their first-class status for three reasons: they had not organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first-class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches.Foot 1986, pp. 23‚Äì28. In 1886, Roe was only available for two of Somerset's matches, but the following year, he was one of the team's leading batsmen. He scored three fifties, and accumulated 272 runs in all for the county, second only to the club captain, Ted Sainsbury. He was less effective in 1888, averaging just 13 runs with a top-score of 27. Despite this, he was elected captain at the club's annual general meeting. Sainsbury, though a good cricketer, was unpopular with the club's committee as he did not live near to Taunton. Herbie Hewett was first proposed, but he declined to take the position. Roe was then elected unanimously to the position, with Hewett as his vice-captain. The club chairman noting that \\"considering what Mr Roe had done for the club his appointment would be a well-deserved compliment.\\" Despite this, the 1889 season summaries refer to Hewett as being the captain, and at the annual meeting that year, it was noted that Hewett was re-elected as captain. Whether he was captain or not, Roe had a poor season. He played four of Somerset's eight matches, averaging 6.1 runs. Indeed, half his 43 runs that season came in one innings, when he scored 27. After the close of Somerset's formal county fixtures, Roe found some form, hitting 83 runs against the Gentlemen of Wiltshire, and 104 against the Gentlemen of Devon. Roe, (back-row, middle, wearing a bowler hat) pictured with the Somerset team in 1892. Somerset had an extraordinary season in 1890, going unbeaten in their thirteen fixtures; winning twelve and tying the other.Foot 1986, p. 27. Though he was described in the Taunton Courier's summary of the season as \\"one of Somerset's best bats\\", Roe was no longer relied upon so much by the team, which could now look to the batting of Hewett and Lionel Palairet. Roe finished the season sixth on the counties batting averages, having managed to play in eight of the county's fixtures. Due to their record in 1890, the county were admitted to the County Championship for 1891 after a unanimous vote, regaining their first-class status.Foot 1986, pp. 27‚Äì28. He played infrequently, and without excelling himself, for Somerset over the subsequent few years. One of his highlights during this period was an innings against Gloucestershire in which he scored 75 runs to help Somerset set up a large victory. The Gloucestershire Chronicle praised him for the pace of his innings; he took an hour to patiently accrue his first 28 runs while the Somerset innings was in trouble, then added another 47 in just over half an hour. During the 1896 season, Roe enjoyed his best run of scores for Somerset. Against Kent, he batted for most of Somerset's innings to score 93 runs without being dismissed, almost half of his team's total, to help Somerset recover from 12 for 5 to post 194. He added a further 45 runs in the second innings, but despite his efforts, Somerset lost by 145 runs. In his next match, Roe posted a low score in the first innings, but recorded his second century in first-class cricket in the second innings to help Somerset secure a draw. He scored 106 runs, including six boundaries. Against Sussex in the next game, Roe scored an unbeaten 85, but was overshadowed by scores of 154 and 156 by Richard and Lionel Palairet, and 191 by Sussex's Ernest Killick. Roe finished the season fourth in the national batting averages, the highest of any Somerset player, his 434 runs coming at an average of 43.4. Each of Somerset's principal batsmen struggled in 1897; both Palairet brothers, Sammy Woods and Roe himself. Roe only passed 50 once that season, and accumulated less than half as many runs as in the previous year, scoring 192 at an average of 21.33. As a result of their batsmen's poor form, Somerset finished the season 11th (of 14) in the County Championship. The next year, Somerset finished bottom of the table, though their batting had mostly improved. Roe was fourth in the team's averages, having scored 265 runs at an average of 33.12. In fact, of his total, 212 of those runs came in two innings. He scored a cautious century against Sussex at the start of August, and then a more attacking one at the end of the month against Surrey. Roe's performances led the Bath Chronicle to note in their season review that \\"there was plenty of cricket still left in him.\\" Despite this assertion, Roe played only once more for Somerset, as one of four Somerset batsmen to be dismissed without scoring in both innings of Somerset's 1899 contest against Middlesex. In all, Roe played 83 first-class matches, alongside a significant number of second-class county matches for Somerset. In first-class cricket he scored 2,690 runs, including four centuries, at an average of 20.22. He also took 32 wickets with his medium pace and spin bowling, and was well-regarded as a fielder, having taken 35 catches.

Many of his monographs on sex, psychology, or health were published by Emanuel Haldeman- Julius in such forms as Big Blue Books. He was the editor of Sexology magazine's question and answer department. Cauldwell and Harry Benjamin were \\"two early and important American voices on transsexuality\\". Biography He was born on June 17, 1897 in Cleveland, Ohio to Gilbert Cauldwell, a surgeon; and Virginia Oliver-Wright. Cauldwell reports himself as having had an interest in sexual anatomy since his childhood. He studied medicine at the Chester College of Medicine and Surgery (later merged with Loyola University Chicago) and at Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico. After several years as a private general practitioner, Cauldwell became an Associate Medical Officer of the Department of War, and as a contract surgeon for the Army, and became a neuro-psychiatrist for the Department of War. In 1945, Cauldwell ended active practice to become a writer on topics of health, notably sexology. In 1949 he used the term transsexual in his essay Psychopathia Transexualis to describe individuals whose sex assigned at birth was different from their gender identity.The German term \\"transsexualismus\\" was introduced by Magnus Hirschfeld in 1923, Cauldwell appears to be the first to use the term for those who desired a change of physiological sex. Compare Die intersexuelle Konstitution in Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen by Magnus Hirschfeld in 1923 versus Psychopathia Transexualis by David Oliver Cauldwell in 1949. Cauldwell distinguished ‚Äúbiological sex‚Äù from ‚Äúpsychological sex‚Äù, and saw the latter as determined by social conditioning. He denied that there were modes of thinking intrinsically linked to male or female biology. Primarily because of this view of gender as plastic, and secondarily because of the limitations of medical science, he regarded sex reassignment surgery as an unacceptable response to transsexualism, and instead advocated that it be treated as a mental disorder. He advocated acceptance of homosexuality and of transvestism. He died on August 30, 1959 in El Paso, Texas of cirrhosis of the liver. He was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in El Paso, Texas.Death certificate for David Oliver Cauldwell  References   Further reading  *Cauldwell, David Oliver.

This concept was introduced by . Differentially closed fields are the analogues for differential equations of algebraically closed fields for polynomial equations.  The theory of differentially closed fields We recall that a differential field is a field equipped with a derivation operator. Let K be a differential field with derivation operator ‚àÇ. *A differential polynomial in x is a polynomial in the formal expressions x, ‚àÇx, ‚àÇ2x, ... with coefficients in K. *The order of a non-zero differential polynomial in x is the largest n such that ‚àÇnx occurs in it, or ‚àí1 if the differential polynomial is a constant. *The separant Sf of a differential polynomial of order n‚â•0 is the derivative of f with respect to ‚àÇnx. *The field of constants of K is the subfield of elements a with ‚àÇa=0. *In a differential field K of nonzero characteristic p, all pth powers are constants. It follows that neither K nor its field of constants is perfect, unless ‚àÇ is trivial. A field K with derivation ‚àÇ is called differentially perfect if it is either of characteristic 0, or of characteristic p and every constant is a pth power of an element of K. *A differentially closed field is a differentially perfect differential field K such that if f and g are differential polynomials such that Sf‚â† 0 and g‚â†0 and f has order greater than that of g, then there is some x in K with f(x)=0 and g(x)‚â†0. (Some authors add the condition that K has characteristic 0, in which case Sf is automatically non-zero, and K is automatically perfect.) *DCFp is the theory of differentially closed fields of characteristic p (where p is 0 or a prime). Taking g=1 and f any ordinary separable polynomial shows that any differentially closed field is separably closed. In characteristic 0 this implies that it is algebraically closed, but in characteristic p>0 differentially closed fields are never algebraically closed. Unlike the complex numbers in the theory of algebraically closed fields, there is no natural example of a differentially closed field. Any differentially perfect field K has a differential closure, a prime model extension, which is differentially closed. Shelah showed that the differential closure is unique up to isomorphism over K. Shelah also showed that the prime differentially closed field of characteristic 0 (the differential closure of the rationals) is not minimal; this was a rather surprising result, as it is not what one would expect by analogy with algebraically closed fields. The theory of DCFp is complete and model complete (for p=0 this was shown by Robinson, and for p>0 by ). The theory DCFp is the model companion of the theory of differential fields of characteristic p. It is the model completion of the theory of differentially perfect fields of characteristic p if one adds to the language a symbol giving the pth root of constants when p>0. The theory of differential fields of characteristic p>0 does not have a model completion, and in characteristic p=0 is the same as the theory of differentially perfect fields so has DCF0 as its model completion. The number of differentially closed fields of some infinite cardinality Œ∫ is 2Œ∫; for Œ∫ uncountable this was proved by , and for Œ∫ countable by Hrushovski and Sokolovic.  The Kolchin topology  The Kolchin topology on K m is defined by taking sets of solutions of systems of differential equations over K in m variables as basic closed sets. Like the Zariski topology, the Kolchin topology is Noetherian. A d-constructible set is a finite union of closed and open sets in the Kolchin topology. Equivalently, a d-constructible set is the set of solutions to a quantifier-free, or atomic, formula with parameters in K.  Quantifier elimination  Like the theory of algebraically closed fields, the theory DCF0 of differentially closed fields of characteristic 0 eliminates quantifiers. The geometric content of this statement is that the projection of a d-constructible set is d-constructible. It also eliminates imaginaries, is complete, and model complete. In characteristic p>0, the theory DCFp eliminates quantifiers in the language of differential fields with a unary function r added that is the pth root of all constants, and is 0 on elements that are not constant.  Differential Nullstellensatz  The differential Nullstellensatz is the analogue in differential algebra of Hilbert's nullstellensatz. *A differential ideal or ‚àÇ-ideal is an ideal closed under ‚àÇ. *An ideal is called radical if it contains all roots of its elements. Suppose that K is a differentially closed field of characteristic 0. . Then Seidenberg's differential nullstellensatz states there is a bijection between *Radical differential ideals in the ring of differential polynomials in n variables, and *‚àÇ-closed subsets of Kn. This correspondence maps a ‚àÇ-closed subset to the ideal of elements vanishing on it, and maps an ideal to its set of zeros.  Omega stability  In characteristic 0 showed that the theory of differentially closed fields is œâ-stable and has Morley rank œâ. In non-zero characteristic showed that the theory of differentially closed fields is not œâ-stable, and showed more precisely that it is stable but not superstable.

His parents originally hailed from Banaripara Upazila of Barisal. He completed the matriculation in 1952 from Dhaka Collegiate School and the intermediate in 1954 from Dhaka College. After completion of bachelors from the Dhaka University in physics, he went to England to study Electrical Engineering at Oxford University at the age of 22. Career During his stay in Oxford University he watched The Seventh Seal by Ingmar Bergman several times and became attracted to filmmaking. He attended the British Film Institute to complete a number of courses on the history of the film industry, film direction and aesthetics. He also got involved with the Communist Party of England and became a reporter of the Communist Party newspaper, the Daily Worker. In the early 60s, Alamgir went for guerrilla warfare training in Cuba. As a reporter of the communist daily, he took interview of Cuban President Fidel Castro. He also took part in the wars of liberation of Palestine and Algeria. Alamgir was the founder of organisations such as East Pakistan House and East Bengal Liberation Front at London and was active in the campaign against racial discrimination. In 1966, Alamgir came back to Dhaka. The Ayub government imprisoned him for his involvement with the leftist movement. Later, he started his professional life as a journalist. With the start of the war of independence in 1971, he joined the Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra as the chief of its English section. He also worked as the chief reporter of the Bangladesh government in exile. This period also marks the start of his directorial life with the making of documentaries.

He served as the band's director from 1946 to his retirement in 1998. His innovations revolutionized college marching band technique and the perceptions of the collegiate band. Foster was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame, the National Association for Distinguished Band Conductors Hall of Fame, the Florida Music Educators Association Hall of Fame and the Afro-American Hall of Fame among others. He also served as the president of the American Bandmasters Association and was appointed to the National Council on the Arts by President Bill Clinton. Foster wrote the book titled The Man Behind the Baton. Education At age 12, Foster began his music career by learning to play the clarinet. While in high school, his talent was recognized and he was appointed student director of the Sumner High School Orchestra, in Kansas City, Kansas. In 1936, he became the director of an all-city band. Foster was a fellow of the Rosenwald General Education Board at Teacher's College, Columbia University, 1953-1955 for Doctorate Studies. He received his Bachelor of Music Education Degree from the University of Kansas in 1941, a Master of Arts in Music Degree from Wayne State University in 1950, a Doctor of Education Degree with a major in music from Teachers College, Columbia University in 1955, and an Honorary Doctor of Human Letters Degree in 1998 from Florida A&M; University. He became a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia in 1953 at Columbia University. The Marching \\"100\\" The original FAMU Band was organized in 1892 under the leadership of P.A. Van Weller. At that time, the school was still known as the State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students. When Foster became the director of bands in 1946, the school was known as the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes. Foster brought over 30 new techniques to the band, which have now become standard procedure for high school and college bands nationwide. Under his direction, the Marching \\"100\\" appeared in films, commercials, numerous magazine and newspaper articles, nationally televised performances. In 1989, the French chose Foster and his band as America's official representative in the Bastille Day Parade, celebrating the bicentennial of the French Revolution. On January 27, 1996, the Marching \\"100\\" was the center-piece of the Opening Ceremonies of the Walt Disney Indy 200. The Band was also the featured attraction at the Fifteenth and Twenty-fifth Anniversary National Telecast of Walt Disney World in 1986 and 1996. In January 1993 and 1997, the band appeared in the Inaugural Parade of President Bill Clinton. Innovation of techniques The collective style of the FAMU marching band evolved by happenstance during band practice in 1946. \\"Our first dance routine, I don't know how or why it came about,\\" said Foster, in his book Band Pageantry, A Guide for the Marching Band. Foster's break with tradition was a fanfare that trumpeted the changing of the guard in marching band style and forever changed the look, feel and emotion associated with halftime performances. The block, militaristic, corps style immediately became secondary to Foster's upbeat, high-energy shows and, by the '60s, bands such as Grambling, Southern and Tennessee State in addition to Florida A&M; began to garner national attention. Foster's innovations made for a quantum leap for a U.S. marching band scene, which had already witnessed lagging interest in live band concerts as the numbers of radio and vinyl-record fans began to soar. While educators saw bands as a way to teach music to large numbers of students, few college bands existed around the turn of the century. Those that did were usually either small and informal club-like organizations modeled on the community bands, or ROTC bands modeled on the music of the military. \\"I don't know what possessed me to go to the dean's office, but I was there and he asked me what I wanted to do,\\" recalled Foster in his book on marching band technique. \\"I told him I wanted to be a conductor, but he said, 'You should rethink that. There are no jobs for colored conductors.' And he was right! So I wanted to develop a band that would be better than any white band in the country.\\" At FAMU, Foster began redefining band pageantry with a showy style‚Äîrapid tempos, high-stepping, dancing, etc., which was eschewed by some band directors who continued to cling to more staid military tradition and its emphasis on correct carriage and marching precision. Foster has been credited with developing at least 30 new marching band techniques, including the double-time marching step of 240 steps per minute or four steps per second, and the triple-time marching step of 360 steps per minute, the death-slow cadence of 20 steps per minute or one step every three seconds, and memorization of all music played in stands, parades, pre-game and halftime shows. Other achievements Foster authored 18 articles for professional journals, 4 published marching band shows, and the textbook, Band Pageantry, considered \\"The Bible\\" for the marching band. He is the composer of Marche Brillante, National Honors March, March Continental, and Centennial Celebration. Foster was the first recipient of the United States Achievement Academy Hall of Fame Award and the Outstanding Educator Award presented by the School of Education Society of the University of Kansas Alumni Association. In 1992, Sports Illustrated declared The 100 as the best marching band in the country. In 1998, Foster was inducted as a Great Floridian by the Museum of Florida History. He was also a director of the prestigious McDonald's All-American High School Band (1980-1992). President Bill Clinton nominated and the United States Congress approved Foster as a member of the National Council on the Arts. Foster was a member of the Hall of Fame of the following organizations: Music Educators National Conference; the Florida Music Educators Association, Florida A&M; University Sports, the National High School Band Directors, and the Afro-American Hall of Fame. He was a Board member with G. Leblanc Corporation, John Philip Sousa Foundation, International Music Festival, Inc., and the Marching Musician. On December 17, 1998, the Board of Electors in Chicago, Illinois elected Foster to the National Band Association Hall of Fame of Distinguished Band Conductors, the most prestigious honor a bandmaster can receive. Death On August 23, 2010, Foster, who had been a resident of Miracle Hill nursing home in Tallahassee, Florida, was admitted to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital's Intensive Care Unit. He died on August 28, 2010 at 12:01 AM. His funeral was held in Florida A&M; University's Lee Hall on September 4, 2010. He was 91 years old. References External links * \\"William P.

The college is affiliated to the University of Gour Banga, which offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in several subjects. Established on July 23, 1944, it is the oldest state-governed college in Malda district. History The roots of the college can be traced to a pre- partition temporary college at Dadanchak (presently under Shibganj Police Station in the district of Nawabganj, Bangladesh). In mid-1943, a report was published in one of the popular local newspapers appealing the public of Maldah district to donate in order to establish the estimated fund of 300,000 Rupees, required to change the Dadanchak College's location to Malda. The much-needed land was given by Mr. Jadunandan Choudhury and Mr. Asutosh Choudhury. In a very little time, the people of Malda donated the estimated sum, which helped start the initial work for shifting. On 1 May 1944, the University of Calcutta granted affiliation to Malda College and on 23 July 1944 the college was officially established by the then District Magistrate of English Bazar, Mr. W. H. Saumarez Smith, as an \\"Intermediate Arts and Commerce College\\", with eight teachers and 150 students. In the founding phase, the college was affiliated to teach English, Vernacular Bengali, Philosophy, Economics, History, and Sanskrit. In 1952, the college moved from its original rented building at the present-day Atul Market-area, Malda, to a new building at Rathbari More, Malda, in a large compound. Two auditoriums were built in 1994, commemorating the golden jubilee celebrations.

It has been nicknamed \\"The Walkie-Talkie\\" because of its distinctive shape. Construction was completed in spring 2014, and the three-floor \\"sky garden\\" was opened in January 2015. The 38-story building is tall. Since July 2017, the building has been owned by Lee Kum Kee Groups. Designed by architect Rafael Vi√±oly and costing over ¬£200 million, 20 Fenchurch Street features a highly distinctive top-heavy form which appears to burst upward and outward. The entrance floor and 34 floors of office space are topped by a large viewing deck. A bar and restaurants are included on the 35th, 36th and 37th floors; these are, with restrictions, open to the public.https://skygarden.london/sky- garden The tower was originally proposed at nearly tall but its design was scaled down after concerns about its visual impact on the nearby St Paul's Cathedral and Tower of London. It was subsequently approved in 2006 with the revised height. Even after the height reduction there were continued concerns from heritage groups about its impact on the surrounding area. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Ruth Kelly, called in the project for another public inquiry. The project was consequently the subject of a public inquiry; in 2007 this ruled in the developers' favour and the building was granted full planning permission. In 2015 it was awarded the Carbuncle Cup for the worst new building in the UK in the previous 12 months. In 2013 Paul Finch of the Design Council CABE said he regretted supporting the project during the public inquiry, saying that the developers \\"made a mess of it\\" and were architects of their own misfortune.  Ownership  Previously owned by the Land Securities Group, the company posted a ¬£95m loss in 2016. In July 2017, the Hong Kong food company Lee Kum Kee Groups agreed to purchase the building from Land Securities and Canary Wharf Group for ¬£1.3 billion. Leasing of the building is carried out by CBRE and in July 2018, CBRE's Asset Services were awarded the contract to carry out all management of 20 Fenchurch Street.  Previous building  the Monument The previous building at 20 Fenchurch Street was tall with 25 storeys and was built in 1968 by Land Securities. The architect was William H. Rogers. The building was formerly occupied by Dresdner Kleinwort and was notable for being one of the first tall buildings in the City of London, and for its distinctive roof. It was one of the towers nearest to the River Thames when viewed from the southern end of London Bridge. In 2007, one of the upper floors was used in the drama series Party Animals. Demolition of the building was completed in 2008. Despite the top-down method of construction, it was not demolished from the bottom-up, as a temporary structure was built, allowing Keltbray, the demolition contractor, to demolish the building from the top down.  Design  The new tower at 20 Fenchurch Street was designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael Vi√±oly. The 'sky garden' at the top of the building was claimed by the developer to be London's highest public park, but since opening there have been debates about whether it can be described as a 'park', and whether it is truly 'public' given the access restrictions. The garden spans the top three floors, which are accessible by two express lifts and include a large viewing area, terrace, bar and two restaurants. Fourteen double-deck lifts (seven low-rise up to the 20th floor, seven high-rise above the 20th floor) serve the main office floors of the building. The south side of the structure is ventilated externally to improve efficiency and decrease solar gain, whilst the east and west faces incorporate extensive solar shading. There is a southern entrance in addition to the main northern entrance set back from Fenchurch Street.  Construction  In January 2009, Canary Wharf Contractors began piling on the site of 20 Fenchurch Street. Piling and ground works were completed in June 2009. In January 2011, work at the basement level of the tower began. By the end of October 2011, the building was rising above street-level. December 2011 saw the tower's core begin to rise.http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6108/6289438745_57da31881a_b.jpghttp://farm7.static.flickr.com/6103/6315754111_50ce6d10e3_b.jpg The concrete core was topped out in March 2012 and by July the structural steelwork was under way around the core. Structural steelwork topped out in December 2012. Fire protection contractor Sharpfibre Ltd began applying fire protection to the structural steelwork in December 2012, completing in March 2013. Cementitious spray was applied to the steelwork, which was supplied directly to the entire building using a purpose-built mixing and pumping station located on the ground floor. The building completed to shell and floor in April 2014 and the first tenants began moving into the building from May 2014 prior to final completion in August of that year.  Criticisms  =Carbuncle Award= The building won the Carbuncle Cup in 2015, awarded by Building Design magazine to the worst new building in the UK during the previous year. The chairman of the jury that decided the prize, Thomas Lane, said \\"it is a challenge finding anyone who has something positive to say about this building\\", whilst a town planner at the nearby Royal Town Planning Institute described the building as \\"a daily reminder never to let such a planning disaster ever happen again.\\" = Solar glare problem = During the building's construction, it was discovered that for a period of up to two hours each day if the sun shines directly onto the building, it acts as a concave mirror and focuses light onto the streets to the south. Spot temperature readings at street-level including up to and were observed during summer 2013, when the reflection of a beam of light up to six times brighter than direct sunlight shining onto the streets beneath damaged parked vehicles, including one on Eastcheap whose owner was paid ¬£946 by the developers for repairs to melted bodywork. Temperatures in direct line with the reflection became so intense that City A.M. reporter Jim Waterson managed to fry an egg in a pan set out on the ground. The reflection also burned or scorched the doormat of a shop in the affected area. The media responded by dubbing the building the \\"Walkie-Scorchie\\" and \\"Fryscraper\\". In September 2013, the developers stated that the City of London Corporation had approved plans to erect temporary screening on the streets to prevent similar incidents, and that they were also \\"evaluating longer-term solutions to ensure the issue cannot recur in future\\". In 2014, a permanent awning was installed on the south side of the higher floors of the tower. The building's architect, Rafael Vi√±oly, also designed the Vdara hotel in Las Vegas which has a similar sunlight reflection problem that some employees called the \\"Vdara death ray\\". The glass has since been covered with a non-reflective film. In an interview with The Guardian, Vi√±oly said that horizontal louvre windows on the south side that had been intended to prevent this problem were removed at some point during the planning process. While he conceded that there had been \\"a lot of mistakes\\" with the building, he agreed with the building's developers that the sun was too high in the sky on that particular day. \\"[I] didn't realise it was going to be so hot,\\" he said, suggesting that global warming was at fault. \\"When I first came to London years ago, it wasn't like this ... Now you have all these sunny days.\\" = Sky garden = The 'sky garden' occupies the 36th to 38th storeys The Sky Garden, which was described as a large, free, public viewing space at the top of the building, was part of the justification for the planners allowing such a vast office block to be built on the edge of a conservation area. Computer visualisations shown to the planners included a glade of full-height trees, but the garden as constructed has a slope with ferns and succulents instead. Free access to the public is provided in 90-minute slots until 18:00, after which the garden is available only to paying customers of the catering facilities. The Garden has been criticised for these restrictions, and for its extent and quality failing to meet pre- construction expectations. Oliver Wainwright, architecture critic of The Guardian, described it as \\"a meagre pair of rockeries, in a space designed with all the finesse of a departure lounge\\". The City of London Corporation's former chief planner, Peter Rees, who approved the structure, said: \\"I think calling it a sky garden is perhaps misleading. If people [are] expecting to visit it as an alternative to Kew, then they will be disappointed.\\" In July 2015 it was reported that planners are to consider a landscape architect's alterations to the layout, following claims it is not consistent with illustrations submitted with the original planning application. The 'sky garden' was a key feature in sealing approval for the building, which is situated outside the main cluster of skyscrapers in the City. = Wind tunnel effect = In July 2015, the building was criticized for having an unexpected impact on wind strength at street-level. The City of London Corporation received an increased number of complaints about draughts around 20 Fenchurch Street following its completion. The Corporation's head of design, Gwyn Richards, said: \\"The wind outcome at street level experienced post- construction on a number of projects differs somewhat to the conditions we were expecting from the one outlined in the planning application wind assessments.\\"  Tenancy  In June 2012 the insurer Markel Corporation signed a tenancy agreement with the developers to move into 20 Fenchurch Street upon its completion. Markel, previously based on Leadenhall Street, was the first confirmed tenant of the new tower and occupies the 25th to 27th floors. Another insurance company, Kiln Group, announced in September 2012 that it had agreed to become the building's second tenant and Ascot Underwriting followed in November 2012. Other insurance companies that have taken space in the building include RSA Group, Tokio Marine, CNA Financial, Allied World, Liberty Mutual's European operations, and Harry Townsend Corp. As of 2017 the ground floor is let for retail and the office space is fully let.

The local administration worked as a subsidiary of the British Government. The tribals under their administration were treated badly by revenue officials, forest guides and police constables, and were subjected to torture. Nayak organised the rebels successfully against exploitation by the officials of Jeypore Samasthanam. This brought him recognition as a potential tribal leader and the National Congress admitted Nayak into its fold. During the course of his training in Naupuri training centre for Congress workers, Nayak had the opportunity to meet and interact with several Zonal and State level leaders which enabled him to broaden his horizons. His training inculcated in him a spirit for Nationalism and indoctrinated him with the Gandhian principles of truth, nonviolence and peaceful non-cooperation with the British Government. He carried a charkha, with the message of adult education and abstinence from alcohol to every tribal household of his area and brought about a total change in the rural scenario. He became the leader of mission in the Congress campaign in the Koraput Sub-division during the first ever election in 1936. Responding to the call of Mahatma Gandhi, Nayak led a procession on 21 August 1942 and demonstrated peacefully in front of Mathili Police Station. The police however fired at the demonstrators indiscriminately, which killed forty and injured more than two hundred people.

In her online \\"Prologue\\" to Anatomy of Deceit, she observes that the feuilleton essay is an important medium for expressing opinions which might ordinarily be censored due to government displeasure, citing recent examples such as former Czechoslovakian dissident and former Czech President V√°clav Havel.  Career  Wheeler makes occasional contributions to the commentary and analysis section of The Guardian, Daily Kos, The Huffington Post, Democracy Now!, and Michigan Liberal. Between early December 2007 and July 2011 Wheeler published primarily on Jane Hamsher's FireDogLake (FDL) and prior to that on The Next Hurrah. Many of Wheeler's 2007 blog entries at The Next Hurrah focused on the Congressional hearings into the dismissal of eight U.S. attorneys subsequent to the November 2006 U.S. midterm election. During United States v. Libby, the trial of I. Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby, Wheeler reported on the testimony as one of the few press-accredited bloggers allowed in the courtroom. In her account, she describes her entries as \\"not a transcript\\"; nevertheless, such bloggers' eye-witness accounts served as sources of reliable information about the trial for readers. In his column/blog White House Watch, published in washingtonpost.com, Dan Froomkin cited the efforts of FiredogLake in live-blogging the Libby trial as \\"essential reading\\" (page 3). During the trial, she appeared on camera in video reports posted online on PoliticsTV.com, along with other accredited Libby trial blogger-correspondents such as TalkLeft creator Jeralyn Merritt and FDL creator Jane Hamsher and FDL principal blogger Christy Hardin Smith. Wheeler held an unpaid, part-time position as \\"Senior Policy Analyst\\" at The Intercept for several months after its February 2014 launch. She has described that period as a \\"chaotic time,\\" and said that working there \\"was a pain in the ass.\\" In particular, she came into conflict with editor-in-chief John Cook, who refused to pay for her work and expertise, was reluctant to publish what she believed was an important surveillance story, and excluded her from the first meeting of all staff reporters‚Äîwhich she construed as Cook's opinion that she was not a worthy journalist. Consequently, she resigned. Wheeler became a witness in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of President Donald Trump's possible connections to Russia after outing one of her sources to the FBI in 2017. Wheeler stated that she had \\"concrete evidence he was lying to [her]\\" and that her source was \\"doing serious harm to innocent people\\". She campaigned for Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean in 2004, and is a former vice chairwoman of the Washtenaw County Democratic Party. Anatomy of Deceit Wheeler's reputation as a blogger stems from her analysis of the outing of the covert CIA identity of Valerie E. Wilson, also known as Valerie Plame, and the Bush administration's justification for 2003 invasion of Iraq and the Iraq War. Several of her posts led to follow-up stories in the mainstream media. As their first book publication by FDL Books (Vaster Books), \\"in order to have Marcy [Wheeler]‚Äôs work seen by a larger audience,\\" FireDogLake and Daily Kos jointly published her book on the CIA leak scandal, entitled Anatomy of Deceit: How the Bush Administration Used the Media to Sell the Iraq War and Out a Spy, on January 28, 2007. Related media articles and interviews Due to her extensive research about the outing of Valerie Plame and her coverage of the Libby trial as a blogger, Wheeler was a guest on NPR's Talk of the Nation. Wheeler was interviewed by online media outlets such as The Raw Story; Amy Goodman interviewed her along with Murray Waas on the radio program Democracy Now! and she was also a special guest at the Daily Kos \\"YearlyKos Convention\\" fundraiser in New York City, on March 10, 2007.  Awards  Wheeler received a 2009 Sidney Hillman Foundation Journalism Award, in the blog category, cited for her body of work, including 2009 coverage of the auto industry crisis, and the evolution of G.W. Bush administration justification and practice of torture (so-called \\"Enhanced Interrogation Techniques\\"). Personal life Wheeler is married to an engineer. Bibliography *Wheeler, Marcy.

Reed (born March 6, 1978) is a Republican former member, and former Majority Leader, of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He represented the 62nd District, made up of parts of Indiana County. In November 2014, Reed was elected House Majority Leader and assumed those duties on December 1. He was sworn into his seventh term on January 6, 2015. Biography =Early life= Reed was born in Blairsville, Pennsylvania. He attended and graduated from Homer-Center High School, where he played football and baseball. After high school, Reed attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania, receiving a bachelor's degree in mathematics/economics. He later earned a master's degree in government administration from the University of Pennsylvania. Reed completed an internship in the Governor's Policy Office for Community and Economic Development in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He also coordinated special projects for the Indiana County Chamber of Commerce and worked as a director of a business-development group for Blairsville, Pennsylvania. =Pennsylvania House of Representatives= In 2002, the 24-year-old Reed challenged Representative Sara Steelman for the 62nd legislative district, winning an upset. Both candidates made improving the local economic climate part of their platforms. Reed was inspired to challenge Steelman after seeing fellow 20-something Jeff Coleman defeat another long-term Democrat in the adjacent 60th legislative district. As a challenger, Reed followed the campaign blueprint established in 2000 by when young Jeff Coleman defeated Tim Pesci in nearby Armstrong County. Coleman personally assisted Reed in his campaign, from recruiting campaign help to advising him on his campaign statements. The political news site PoliticsPA named Reed's campaign website the \\"sixth best website\\" in Pennsylvania during the election season. During the campaign, Steelman \\"erupted\\" on the district's airwaves with taxpayer-funded \\"public service announcements\\" for the first time in a decade. His website was praised by PoliticsPA as being among the best in that election cycle. With the 57-43 victory, Reed became the youngest member of the House. Coleman had previously held that distinction. In 2003, the political website PoliticsPA named him to \\"The Best of the Freshman Class\\" list, saying that \\"What he lacks in practical experience, Reed more than makes up for with hard work.\\" =U.S. Congressional campaign= In January 2018, Reed announced he would campaign for the United States Congress in Pennsylvania's 9th congressional district after Bill Shuster announced he would not run for re-election in 2018. However, he ended his campaign several months later when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled the current district maps illegal and established new district maps. The new maps placed Reed's residence in Indiana, Pennsylvania in a new 15th congressional district alongside current Representative Glenn Thompson. =Personal life= Reed is married to the former Heather Camp, whom he met during his first election campaign. They have a son and two daughters, and reside in White Township, Pennsylvania.

His most influential book, Systematic Theology, proved to be a mainstay of Reformed Baptist theological education for several generations. Biography He was born on August 3, 1836 in Rochester, New York. His father was Alvah Strong, printer of such early Rochester newspapers as the Anti-Masonic Enquirer, the Morning Advertiser, and the Weekly Republican before becoming the longtime proprietor of The Daily Democrat. His grandfather was a \\"physician of considerable eminence\\" from Warren, Connecticut who moved to Scipio, New York in 1799 and Rochester in 1821. Both his eldest uncle and father were deacons in the First Baptist Church of Rochester and helped found the Rochester Theological Seminary, over which he later presided. His youngest uncle became a 49er after losing both his wife and infant son. His younger brother, Henry A. Strong, was a wildly successful businessman and philanthropist who served as Eastman Kodak's first president. He graduated from Yale College in 1857, having had a religious conversion during his time in college. He began his theological studies at Rochester Theological Seminary and was awarded his D.D. in Germany. In August 1861 he was ordained pastor of First Baptist Church of Haverhill, Massachusetts. After his short pastorate in Haverhill, he went on in 1865 to become the pastor of First Church, Cleveland, OH, and from there to become president of Rochester Theological Seminary, during which time he wrote his Systematic Theology. His eldest son was the American psychologist and philosopher, Charles A. Strong. Diplomat Theodore C. Achilles was a first cousin, twice removed. A niece married George R. Carter and a second cousin, twice removed married Margaret Woodbury Strong. Theology Strong held a form of inclusivism, that is, he believed that some people from non-Christian religions actually believe in the one true God, the God revealed in the Bible.

Two or more fictional characters are often combined into a single character in the course of an adaptation of a work for a different medium, as in adapting a novel in the course of authoring a screenplay for a film. A composite character may be modeled on historical or biographical figures. An amalgamation or amalgam, when used to refer to a fictional character or place, refers to one that was created by combining, or is perceived to be a combination of, several other previously existing characters or locations. To emphasize the origin of their creations, authors or artists may use amalgamated names. An example of an historical composite character is the three Herods in the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles. Herod the Great (Luke 1:5), Herod Antipas (Luke 3:1; 9:7-9; 13:31-33; 23:5-12), and Herod Agrippa I (Acts 12:1-23) are three separate historical rulers. Yet they are portrayed as a single composite character who functions in Luke-Acts \\"as an actualization of Satan‚Äôs desire to impede the spread of the good news though his [\\"Herod‚Äôs\\"] rejection of the gospel message and through political persecution\\", for example the execution of John (Luke 9:7‚Äì9), Jesus (Acts 4:24‚Äì28), James (Acts 12:1‚Äì2), and the attempted execution of Peter (Acts 12:3‚Äì5).Frank E. Dicken, Herod as a Composite Character in Luke-Acts, Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament II 375 (T√ºbingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2014), 7. Composite characters are also found in apocalyptic literature, for example the Book of Revelation. The two witnesses of Revelation 11 are an amalgamation of several character traits taken from Jeremiah, Elijah, and Moses. The composite characterization of the two witnesses represents the Christian community as a whole (the church) in their specific vocation as witnesses.

Use in journalism Creating composite characters in journalism is considered a misrepresentation of facts and, without appropriate notice to the reader, unethical. Some writers who are considered journalists or who describe themselves as journalists have on occasion used composite characters. *In 1944, The New Yorker ran a series of articles by Joseph Mitchell on New York's Fulton Fish Market that were presented as journalism. Only when the story was published four years later as the book Old Mr. Flood did Mitchell write, \\"Mr. Flood is not one man; combined in him are aspects of several old men who work or hang out in Fulton Fish Market, or who did in the past.\\" Mitchell assigned his composite character his own birthday and his own love for the Bible and certain authors. In his introduction to Mr. Flood, Mitchell wrote, \\"I wanted these stories to be truthful rather than factual, but they are solidly based on facts.\\" *John Hersey is said to have created a composite character in a Life magazine story as did Alastair Reid for The New Yorker. *Vivian Gornick in 2003 said that she used composite characters in some of her articles for the Village Voice. Amalgamated places Places may be amalgamated in fiction by taking districts, landmarks, or characters of real-world locations, or previously created locations of another work of fiction. For example, a sample fictional city could contain the Eiffel Tower a block away from the Forbidden City, where Bill Gates may be living after having bought a nearby clacks tower from Albus Dumbledore. Usually, if the author or artist desires the city to be more believable, he or she will amalgamate it only from real places, whereas if the story is more fantastic, fictional places may be better. An author or artist may choose to amalgamate a city rather than imagining all of its aspects from scratch in order to be humorous by referencing other works and/or real places, or to avoid having to name his or her city altogether, such as when shooting a film in several existing cities, while the city portrayed is supposed not to exist. =Examples= *Mega City (The Matrix) *San Fransokyo (Big Hero 6) See also *Fictional character *Fictional location References Category:Fictional characters by role in the narrative structure Category:Journalism ethics Category:Literary motifs ","title":"Composite character"},{"id":"10471326","text":"John Raymond Martin (18 November 1909 ‚Äì 28 July 1988) was an Australian rules footballer who played in the VFL in 1930 and then from 1932 to 1940 for the Richmond Football Club.

Its name is derived from that of the native camas plant. Lacamas Creek is fed by numerous streams, but the five largest tributaries are Matney Creek, Shanghai Creek, Fifth Plain Creek, China Ditch, and Dwyer Creek. Geologists think it likely that the creek used to flow westward through the Burnt Bridge Creek channel. This changed when the Missoula Floods deposited an alluvial fan that diverted the flow into the Lacamas Lake trough. Watershed and water quality Lacamas Creek drains a basin of . About 41 percent of the basin is forested, while the rest is developed to one degree or another. The least developed land is near the headwaters, while the most developed is near the mouth. Farm fields, pastures, shrublands, and bare earth cover about 35 percent of the watershed. Residential, commercial, and industrial uses account for most of the rest. Water quality along the creek varies from \\"good\\" in the forest to \\"fair\\" along the lower reaches near Camas. The watershed's artificial channels such as China Ditch have water of \\"very poor\\" quality. These were dug as early as the 1890s to drain wetlands for farming and to supply water to mills in Camas. Eliminating wetlands has increased runoff surges during heavy rains, eroded streambanks, and increased lowland flooding. Lacamas and Round lakes, connected by a short channel, have water of \\"fair\\" quality. The sedimentation rate of the lakes has increased eightfold since the beginning of the 19th century. As a result, both lakes are eutrophic, containing many nutrients found in fertilizer, soil, and waste from people and animals. Blooms of algae and other aquatic plants supported by the nutrients deplete the oxygen in the lakes and make it hard for fish to survive. Recreation Activities on Lacamas and Round lakes include boating, swimming, water skiing, picnicking, biking, and fishing. Lacamas Heritage Trail, long, runs along the shore of Lacamas Lake. A trail system at Lacamas Park at Round Lake connects to waterfalls on the lower reaches of the creek. Round Lake is stocked with bluegill, bass, and perch.

Old Overholt is a rye whiskey distilled by A. Overholt & Co., currently a subsidiary of Beam Suntory, which is a subsidiary of Suntory Holdings of Osaka, Japan. It is produced at the Jim Beam distillery in Clermont, Kentucky. It is one of the most commonly available straight rye whiskies in the U.S., where it is available at most liquor stores. It is aged for three years and bottled at 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume). A four-year Bottled In Bond, 100 proof version was released in late 2017. Old Overholt has been called a \\"foundation stone of American whiskey\\" because of its long history. History =Early years= Henry Oberholzer (Anglicized to \\"Overholt\\"), a German Mennonite farmer, moved to West Overton, Pennsylvania, on the banks of Jacobs Creek in Western Pennsylvania in 1800. His family came from the area of Germany which specialized in distilling \\"korn\\", or rye whiskey, and Henry took up the tradition. =Growth= Abraham Overholt (1784‚Äì1870)In 1810, Henry's son Abraham Overholt (1784‚Äì1870) took over management of the distillery and made it into a business. By the 1820s, the distillery was putting out 12 to 15 gallons of rye whiskey per day. Abraham grew the company rapidly; by 1843, Baltimore newspapers were advertising Overholt's \\"Old Rye\\"; at that time, only the very few top distilleries were advertised by name. By 1859, Overholt incorporated his business as \\"A. Overholt & Co.\\" He operated out of a new distillery building that was six stories high, 100 feet long, and which could produce 860 gallons per day. In 1881, Abraham's grandson Henry Clay Frick took over the company. As one of the country's wealthiest people, the distillery was a sentimental side-business for Frick. Frick took on Andrew Mellon and one Charles W. Mauck as partners, each owning one-third of the business. In 1888, Mauck adopted the name \\"Old Overholt\\" as the official name of the company, adding a picture of Abraham as the logo. Around that time, the company started selling its product in bottles instead of barrels. By 1900, Old Overholt became a national brand. In the early years of the 20th Century, Old Overholt became one of the largest and most respected whiskeys in the country. Frick died in December 1919, and left his share to Andrew Mellon. This ended family ownership in the company. =Prohibition= The Old Overholt Distillery in West Overton, PA The national prohibition of alcohol in 1920 hit most American breweries and distilleries hard, putting many out of business. Perhaps because of its association with Mellon, who was then secretary of the treasury under Warren G. Harding, Old Overholt was able to secure a permit for selling medicinal whiskey. This permit allowed Overholt to sell existing whiskey stocks to druggists for medicinal use. In 1925, under pressure from prohibitionists, Mellon sold his share of the company to a New York grocer, thus ending local ownership. The company was sold again in 1932 to National Distillers Products Co., which owned more than 200 brands. =War and decline= During World War II, Overholt and other whiskey distilleries were ordered by the government to make industrial alcohol. After war's end, whiskey fell out of favor with the American public generally, as drinkers switched to vodka. Rye whiskey especially fell out of favor, and by the 1960s, Old Overholt was the only nationally distributed straight rye whiskey. The brand struggled through the 1970s as sales continued to decline. In 1987, Old Overholt was sold to the James B. Beam Distilling Company, a subsidiary of American Brands, which moved production to Kentucky. Later the Jim Beam division was acquired by Suntory. Since December 2015, Old Overholt and Old Grand-Dad, both of which are Beam Suntory brands, have been marketed together as \\"The Olds\\".The Olds, Beam Suntory. In popular culture Old Overholt is closely associated with the Old West, particularly Tombstone, Arizona and is served in \\"Old West\\" tourist saloons in Tombstone today. The brand was parodied in a Warner Brothers cartoon and in the Terry Pratchett novels The Dark Side of the Sun and Soul Music as \\"Old Overcoat\\". The Old Overholt distillery was a plot element at the end of season 3 of Boardwalk Empire. The distillery was part of a deal between Andrew Mellon and Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson, who persuaded him to let him manage it in order to implicate Jess Smith and George Remus. Overholt is mentioned as the favored whiskey of Sonny McGuiness, a prospector, in the novel EarthCore by Scott Sigler. =Famous drinkers= Overholt is said to have been the alcoholic beverage of choice for notables ranging from Old West gunfighters to U.S. presidents, including: * Gunfighter and gambler Doc Holliday * Old West outlaw Johnny Ringo * Civil War general and U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant * U.S. President John F. Kennedy * U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles Reviews Food critic Morgan Murphy said \\"This very old brand of rye whiskey needles the drinker with zings of fruit flavors, grain bite, and sweet cereal notes.\\" Whisky writer Jim Murray said \\"creamy nose...citrus notes...very hard rye...momentarily moist and sweet before going on to perfect the driest, crispest finish of its genre\\".

This person then uses their knowledge to kill the victim. In some cases, as time goes on, this behavior escalates to encompass the healthy and the easily treated.  Characteristics and motivations  The motivation for this type of criminal is variable, but generally falls into one or more types or patterns: * Mercy killer: Believe the victims are suffering or beyond help, though this belief may be delusional. * Sadistic: Use their position as a way of exerting power and control over helpless victims. * Malignant hero: A pattern wherein the subject endangers the victim's life in some way and then proceeds to \\"save\\" them. Some feign attempting resuscitation, all the while knowing their victim is already dead and beyond help, but hope to be seen as selflessly making an effort. =In the medical field= Some people with a pathological interest in the power of life and death can be attracted to medical or related professions.SitpondWhittle and RitchieLinedeckerHickey (1997), p. 142 Killers who occupy the role of a professional career are sometimes referred to as \\"angels of death\\" or angels of mercy. In this role they may kill their patients for money, for a sense of sadistic pleasure, for a belief that they are \\"easing\\" the patient's pain, or simply \\"because they can\\".Holmes, Ronald, & Holmes, Stephen. (2009). Serial murder. Sage Publications, Inc. In some cases the killer claims the motive is euthanasia when it is not, and the difference is that a serial killer lacks a sense of compassion towards the patient which is expected in situations of euthanasia. Most murders committed by nurses are performed by lethal injection. The typical medical professional who murders kills two patients each month. A 2011 study of characterizing 70 female serial killers found that 30% of the offenders were nurses. One such killer was nurse Jane Toppan, who admitted during her murder trial that she was sexually aroused by death. She would administer a drug mixture to patients she chose as her victims, lie in bed with them and hold them close to her body as they died. Another example is Harold Shipman, an English family doctor, who made it appear that his victims died of natural causes (disease). Between 1975 and 1998, he murdered at least 215 patients; he is suspected of having murdered 250 people. Dr. John Bodkin Adams, meanwhile, though acquitted in 1957 of the murder of one patient, is believed to have killed around 163 patients in Eastbourne, England. An example of a malignant hero serial killer was Richard Angelo, who was called the \\"angel of death\\", or angel of mercy. Angelo devised a plan where he would inject the patient with drugs, then rush into the room and attempt to \\"save\\" the patient so that he could be a hero to the patient's family. This motive of excitement from inducing a health crisis for the patient has recently been labeled as a professional version of M√ºnchausen syndrome by proxy, a type of factitious disorder.Yorker, B., Kizer, K., Lampe, P., Forrest, A., Lannan, J., & Russell, D. (2006). \\"Serial Murder by Healthcare Professionals\\". Journal of Forensic Sciences, 51(6), 1362-1371. Richard Angelo confessed to killing 25 of his patients. A number of medical murderers were involved in fraud. For example, H. H. Holmes was often involved in insurance scams and confidence tricks.http://www.themediadrome.com/content/articles/history_articles/holmes.htm Harold Shipman had a previous conviction for prescription fraud and forgery, for which he was fined ¬£600. More known \\"Angels of Death\\" include: * Beverley Allitt, English nurse who murdered four child patients * Kristen Gilbert, American nurse and convicted serial killer * Donald Harvey, American orderly and convicted serial killer * Aino Nykopp-Koski, Finnish nurse convicted of five murders and five attempts of murder. * Michael Swango, American physician who poisoned over 30 patients and coworkers * Niels H√∂gel, German nurse and convicted serial killer There is concern that legalized euthanasia could enable serial killers, who could use euthanasia to mask murderous motives. Concern over this possibility could fuel mistrust of palliative care practitioners among the general public, and mistrust of government agencies to properly oversee nursing homes.  In popular culture  The two spinster aunts in Joseph Kesselring's play Arsenic and Old Lace act as angels of mercy for lonely old men, poisoning them with elderberry wine laced with arsenic, strychnine and cyanide. The character Annie Wilkes in the Stephen King novel Misery seems to be a serial killer of this type. Additionally, \\"angel of mercy\\" is mentioned in Agatha Christie's novel By the Pricking of My Thumbs. The novel The 5th Horseman in James Patterson's Women's Murder Club series features an \\"Angel of Mercy\\" serial killer. The term is also mentioned in a Fear Factory song \\"Demanufacture\\". In the television series Dexter, Dexter Morgan's first kill is his father's nurse, an angel of mercy, who worked in the fictional Angel of Mercy Hospital. In season 1, episode 5 of the television series Elementary, \\"Lesser Evils\\", Sherlock Holmes solves a series of angel of death murders at a hospital, revealed to be the work of the janitor, himself an ex-doctor. In season 3, episode 7 of the television series Lie to Me, \\" Veronica\\", Dr. Lightman helps a woman with early-onset Alzheimer's disease uncover a traumatic memory from her past, and in the process discovers that there may be an \\"angel of death\\" working in her health care facility. British soap opera Hollyoaks featured a storyline of the \\"gloved hand killer\\" featuring Lindsey Butterfield a seemingly hardworking and kind doctor who crumbled under the pressure to be in control. She administered potassium chloride injections to patients to render heart attacks and cover her tracks. She killed seven people and attempted to kill three more, and attempted to kill her younger sister as a young girl. American TV series, \\"Fargo (TV series)\\" featured a fledgling Angel Mercy in Season 4, episode 1 - 2. The character ‚ÄúNurse Oraetta Mayflower‚Äù, played by Jessie Buckley, attempts to shoot a fatal dose of morphine into Italian-American crime boss Donatello Fadda, referring to herself as an Angel of Mercy.

Its relief is very rough and rocky. The contours are very steep, especially on the west side of the island. The island is white in appearance due to the deposition of guano by seabirds. Reserve This island is an ecological and tourist reserve formed by mountains largely devoid of vegetation. It is the largest of the islands in El Ferrol Bay (Chimbote Bay) and is located northwest of the city of Chimbote, about 5 km from the coast. It preserves a guano island, the l√≠tico forest, the fauna of the island, coves, and defiles. The island has no human population. It serves as a refuge to some guaneras birds such as pelicans and gulls. When taking refuge these guaneras birds in this place the birds carry ticks. There are also small lizards on the island that feed on the ticks. Sea lions can be found in the surroundings of the island.

James Birrell practiced from 1951 to 1986. Personal life James Peter Birrell was born in Melbourne on the 24 October 1928, the eldest child of Harry and Elizabeth Birrell. Growing up in North Essendon, Birrell attended North Essendon Primary School from 1934‚Äì40 and Essendon State High School from 1940‚Äì44. In 1945 at the age of 17 James Birrell was accepted into the Melbourne Technical College as an architecture student. To help finance his studies Birrell worked part-time as a builder's labourer. In 1947 Birrell began work as a draughtsman for the Victorian State Works Department and continued his studies Part-time. The same year he also became involved in the Contemporary Arts Society, through the Society he gained many new friends, notably Peter Burns. In 1950 Birrell was accepted into Fourth Year Architecture at The University of Melbourne. In 1951 he graduated and designed his first houses, in Frankston and Warrandyte, Birrell also worked briefly as the resident Architect at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. In 1952 Birrell co-founded the magazine Architecture and Arts with his contemporaries, Peter Burns, Helen O'Donnell and Norman Lehey. In 1954 Birrell contributed to the Contemporary Arts Society's exhibition 'Space Modulators' along with artists including Sidney Nolan, Ian Fairweather, Charles Blackman, Arthur Boyd and John Perceval. Working for the Commonwealth Works Department, Birrell was transferred to Canberra, before going on to Darwin and finally Brisbane. In Brisbane James Birrell went on to become Brisbane City Council Architect and University of Queensland Staff Architect. It was during this period that Birrell designed his most significant buildings. Throughout his life Birrell admired the works of Walter Burley Griffin and in 1964 he wrote a biography on Griffin. In March 1985 James Birrell was elected as a councillor for the Shire of Maroochy in Queensland. Birrell's archive is held at the Fryer Library at the University of Queensland and the State Library of Queensland. Birrell died 20 September 2019. Notable projects Annerley Library, 2016 Brisbane City Council ArchitectCentenary Pool Complex, 2008In 1956 as Brisbane City Council Architect Birrell designed the Chermside and Annerley Libraries, Centenary Pool Complex at Spring Hill as well as numerous public amenities. In 1957 his design proposal for the Centenary Pool complex was successful with construction finishing in 1959. Architecture and Arts magazine named the building as one of the top ten buildings within Australia. Toowong Municipal Library, 1998 Birrell also designed the former Toowong Municipal Library Building, which was completed in 1961. Located on Coronation Drive, it was directly opposite to Birrell's Toowong Pool (which has since been demolished). The library is heritage listed although is now used for commercial purposes (medical imaging-MRI). University of Queensland Staff Architect Union College, 2014 From 1961‚Äì66 James Birrell practiced as The University of Queensland Staff Architect. In this position he designed and documented Union College, which was constructed in five stages from 1964 and 1972. Union College was highly commended after its construction. It was visually pleasing while also being innovative in terms of the structure and its response to pre-existing site conditions. Union College received a High Commendation award from Arts and Architecture journal as one of the best ten new buildings in Australia at the time. J D Story Administration Building, University of Queensland, St Lucia, October 1966 During his tenure as staff architect James Birrell was also responsible for the JD Story Administration Building (1965) the Agriculture and Entomology Building, now known as the Hartley Teakle Building (1966).

Life  thumb Seal of Ulrich I (1259) Ulrich's relation to his predecessors is uncertain. The historian Hansmartin Decker Hauff labelled Ulrich as a son of Hermann of W√ºrttemberg and Irmengard of Ulten. Hermann, of which very little is known, is probably a son of Hartmann, Count of W√ºrttemberg. Ulrich is believed to have been a cousin to Hartmann II, Count of Gr√ºningen, and to have a paternal relation with Albert IV, Count of Dillingen. He was twice married. From his marriage to Mechthild of Baden, daughter of Hermann V, he had two daughters, and a son, who succeeded him as Ulrich II. From his second marriage to Agnes of Schlesien-Liegnitz, he had another son, Eberhard I, and possibly another daughter.  Count of W√ºrttemberg  The argument between Emperor Frederick II and the Popes Gregory IX and Innocent IV had effects on conditions in the duchy of Swabia, of which W√ºrttemberg was a part. After Frederick's excommunication and deposition by the Council of Lyon, Ulrich joined Anti-king Henry Raspe and William of Holland, against Frederick's son Conrad IV. With Ulrich's support, Conrad IV was defeated. Ulrich used the situation, to develop his power within Swabia. After the death of Conrad IV in 1254, however, his two-year-old son Conradin was recognized as Duke of Swabia. Conradin's guardian, Louis II, Duke of Bavaria, annexed the territories that Ulrich had gained from defeating Conrad IV, to Swabia. Ulrich was forced to concentrate on the middle Neckar valley as the basis of the county of W√ºrttemberg.

He was a son of the dynasty's founder Emperor Gaozu of Tang (Li Yuan), and in the intense rivalry developed between his older brothers Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince and Li Shimin the Prince of Qin, he sided with Li Jiancheng and often advocated drastic actions against Li Shimin, including assassination. In 626, Li Shimin, fearing that Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji were about to kill him, laid an ambush for them at Xuanwu Gate outside the palace and killed them. Li Shimin then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong).  Background  Li Yuanji was born in 603, during the reign of Emperor Wen of Sui. He was the fourth and final son of Li Yuan the Duke of Tang, a hereditary noble, and Li Yuan's wife Duchess Dou, who was herself the daughter of Dou Yi (Á´áÊØÖ) the Duke of Shenwu and Northern Zhou's Princess Xiangyang. He had three older brothers by Duchess Dou -- Li Jiancheng, Li Shimin, and Li Xuanba (ÊùéÁéÑÈú∏, who died in 614). She also gave birth to an older sister of Li Yuanji's, the eventual Princess Pingyang. In 616, with agrarian rebellions beginning to engulf northern China and frequent Eastern Tujue incursions across the border, Emperor Yang of Sui commissioned Li Yuan to be the commander of the forces at Taiyuan, guarding it against both agrarian rebels and Eastern Tujue. At that time, Li Yuan took Li Shimin with him to Taiyuan, but left Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji, another son Li Zhiyun (ÊùéÊô∫Èõ≤), and the rest of his household at Hedong (Ê≤≥Êù±, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). In 617, Li Yuan, fearful that Emperor Yang might punish him for his inability to suppress the rebels led by Liu Wuzhou the Dingyang Khan, was persuaded by Li Shimin to rebel against Sui rule. He then sent secret messengers to Hedong to summon his sons and to the capital Chang'an to summon his daughter and son-in- law Chai Shao (Êü¥Á¥π). Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji secretly travelled to Taiyuan, but left the 13-year-old Li Zhiyun at Hedong.  Participation in Tang's founding  Even before Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji, and Chai Shao (who, at the urging of Li Yuan's daughter, left Chang'an on his own while she went into hiding) arrived at Taiyuan, Li Yuan rebelled, declaring that he wanted to support Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You the Prince of Dai, then nominally in charge at Chang'an, as emperor, while honoring Emperor Yang as Taishang Huang (retired emperor). In response, Sui officials arrested Li Zhiyun, took him to Chang'an, and executed him. Li Yuan made Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin both key generals, but the younger Li Yuanji was not, initially, although Li Yuan created him the Duke of Guzang. When Li Yuan subsequently began his campaign toward Chang'an, he left Li Yuanji in charge at Taiyuan. Later that year, after he captured Chang'an and declared Yang You emperor (as Emperor Gong) but kept power for himself as regent, he created Li Yuanji the Duke of Qi and put him in charge of the 15 commanderies around Taiyuan. In spring 618, Emperor Yang, then at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), was killed in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji. When the news arrived at Chang'an, Li Yuan had Yang You yield the throne to him, establishing Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu. He created Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi. It was said that, while he was at Taiyuan, Li Yuanji was arrogant and wasteful, and he often held military exercises with his concubines and servants, involving use of actual armor and arms, and they suffered many casualties in these exercises, including injuries to Li Yuanji himself. His wet nurse Chen Shanyi (Èô≥ÂñÑÊÑè) tried to get him to change his ways, but he had his guards batter her to death. In spring 619, when his assistant Yuwen Xin (ÂÆáÊñáÊ≠Ü) reported this to Emperor Gaozu, Emperor Gaozu temporarily removed him from his post. Less than a month later, however, with the people of Taiyuan petitioning to have Li Yuanji kept in charge, Emperor Gaozu restored him. (The traditional historians allege that Li Yuanji pressured the people into petitioning Emperor Gaozu.) In summer 619, Liu Wuzhou launched an attack on the Taiyuan region, and Li Yuanji sent the general Zhang Da (ÂºµÈÅî) to resist Liu, despite Zhang's protestations that the army given him was too small to resist Liu. When Zhang was in fact defeated, he surrendered to Liu and served as Liu's guide in subsequent attacks. Liu soon put Taiyuan under siege, and while Li Yuanji initially repelled him, Liu was soon back and again had Taiyuan under siege. In fall 619, Li Yuanji fled with his wife and concubines back to Chang'an, and Liu captured Taiyuan, moving his capital from Mayi (È¶¨ÈÇë, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi) there. (In 620, Li Shimin defeated Liu and recaptured the region.) In 621, with Li Shimin leading the army in besieging Luoyang, the capital of Wang Shichong's rival Zheng state, Li Yuanji served as Li Shimin's assistant. When subsequently another rival ruler, Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia, came to Wang's aid, Li Shimin left Li Yuanji at Luoyang to continue the siege and to watch Wang, while he himself advanced to Hulao Pass to engage Dou. Li Shimin defeated and captured Dou at the Battle of Hulao, and Wang, in fear, surrendered. Li Shimin received the most honors stemming from the victory, but Li Yuanji also received promotions and honors. Subsequently, when Emperor Gaozu had the government mint new coins, there were strict prohibitions against minting by any other persons, except that Li Shimin and Li Yuanji were each granted the right to have three mints and Pei Ji was granted the right to have one mint. Later that year, when Dou's general Liu Heita rose in resistance to Tang rule and took over all of Dou's former territory, Li Shimin and Li Yuanji were sent against him. Li Shimin defeated Liu in spring 622, forcing Liu to flee to Eastern Tujue. Subsequently, they attacked another rebel leader, Xu Yuanlang the Prince of Lu, when Li Shimin returned to Chang'an and left Li Yuanji in charge of the operations against Xu. Meanwhile, however, Liu returned from Eastern Tujue and again occupied Dou's old territory, and Li Yuanji was not able to stop him.  Role in the rivalry between Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin  Meanwhile, an intense rivalry had developed between Li Jiancheng, who as the oldest son was Emperor Gaozu's crown prince, and Li Shimin, as Li Jiancheng, while a capable general himself, was overshadowed by Li Shimin, who had done much to solidify Tang rule by destroying Liu Wuzhou, Wang Shichong, Dou Jiande, and Xue Rengao. Li Yuanji supported Li Jiancheng in this rivalry, as he believed that if Li Jiancheng became emperor, Li Jiancheng would create him crown prince. Since their mother Duchess Dou had died in 614, the fact that Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji had better relations with Emperor Gaozu's favored young concubines than Li Shimin did take a notable importance, since those concubines helped rehabilitate Li Jiancheng's standing before Emperor Gaozu, causing him to no longer consider making Li Shimin crown prince instead, as he considered at one point. After Liu Heita returned from Eastern Tujue and reoccupied old Xia territory, Li Jiancheng, at the suggestion of his staff members Wang Gui and Wei Zheng, volunteered to lead the army against Liu. Emperor Gaozu thus sent Li Jiancheng, assisted by Li Yuanji, against Liu. Around the new year 623, with Liu's forced bogged down while attacking Tang's Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei), Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji engaged him at Guantao (È§®Èô∂, in modern Handan as well), crushing him. Liu fled north toward Eastern Tujue, but was ambushed and captured by his own official Zhuge Dewei (Ë´∏ËëõÂæ∑Â®Å), who delivered him to Li Jiancheng. Li Jiancheng executed Liu. China was by this point almost completely unified by Tang. At one point, Li Yuanji tried to persuade Li Jiancheng to have Li Shimin assassinated when Li Shimin was visiting Li Yuanji's mansion, but Li Jiancheng, not having the heart to kill a brother, stopped Li Yuanji from doing so. In 624, Li Jiancheng requisitioned a number of soldiers from the general Li Yi the Prince of Yan, to supplement his guard corps, against Emperor Gaozu's regulations. When this was revealed to Emperor Gaozu, Emperor Gaozu rebuked Li Jiancheng and exiled his guard commander Keda Zhi (ÂèØÈÅîÂøó). When, subsequently, Li Jiancheng nevertheless requested the commandant at Qing Prefecture (ÊÖ∂Â∑û, in modern Qingyang, Gansu), Yang Wen'gan (Ê•äÊñáÂππ), to conscript troops, presumably to guard against Li Shimin, the officers Erzhu Huan (ÁàæÊú±ÁÖ•) and Qiao Gongshan (Ê©ãÂÖ¨Â±±) informed Emperor Gaozu that Li Jiancheng was encouraging Yang to start a rebellion so that they could seize power together. Emperor Gaozu, then at Renzhi Palace (‰ªÅÊô∫ÂÆÆ, in modern Tongchuan, Shaanxi), was incensed, and summoned Li Jiancheng, then at Chang'an, to Renzhi Palace. Li Jiancheng briefly flirted the idea of occupying Chang'an and not accepting the order, but eventually reported to Renzhi Palace to request forgiveness. Emperor Gaozu put him under arrest. When Yang heard this, Yang rebelled, and Emperor Gaozu, after promising Li Shimin that he would be made crown prince, sent Li Shimin to attack Yang. (Under Emperor Gaozu's promise, Li Jiancheng would be removed as crown prince and created the Prince of Shu instead. He would then send Li Jiancheng to the modern Sichuan region.) Once Li Shimin left, however, Li Yuanji, Emperor Gaozu's concubines, and the chancellor Feng Deyi, all spoke on Li Jiancheng's behalf, and Emperor Gaozu changed his mind, released Li Jiancheng, and allowed him to return to Chang'an and remain as crown prince. Instead, Emperor Gaozu only blamed the discord between his sons on Li Jiancheng's staff members Wang Gui and Wei Ting (ÈüãÊå∫), and Li Shimin's staff member Du Yan, exiling them. Yang was subsequently assassinated by his own subordinates. Later that year, Emperor Gaozu, troubled by repeated Eastern Tujue incursions, seriously considered burning Chang'an to the ground and moving the capital to Fancheng (Ê®äÂüé, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), a suggestion that Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji, and the chancellor Pei Ji agreed with. Li Shimin opposed, however, and the plan was not carried out. Meanwhile, Li Shimin himself was sending his confidants to Luoyang to build up personal control of the army there. After an incident in which Li Shimin suffered a severe case of food poisoning after feasting at Li Jiancheng's palace‚Äîan event that both Emperor Gaozu and Li Shimin apparently interpreted as an assassination attempt‚ÄîEmperor Gaozu considered sending Li Shimin to guard Luoyang to prevent further conflict, but Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji, after consulting each other, believed that this would only give Li Shimin an opportunity to build up his personal power there, and therefore opposed it. Emperor Gaozu therefore did not carry out the plan.  Death  By 626, Li Shimin was fearful that he would be killed by Li Jiancheng, and his staff members Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, and Zhangsun Wuji were repeatedly encouraging Li Shimin to attack Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji first‚Äîwhile Wei Zheng was encouraging Li Jiancheng to attack Li Shimin first. Li Jiancheng persuaded Emperor Gaozu to remove Fang and Du, as well as Li Shimin's trusted guard officers Yuchi Gong and Cheng Zhijie (Á®ãÁü•ÁØÄ), from Li Shimin's staff. Zhangsun, who remained on Li Shimin's staff, continued to try to persuade Li Shimin to attack first. In summer 626, Eastern Tujue was making another attack, and under Li Jiancheng's suggestion, Emperor Gaozu, instead of sending Li Shimin to resist Eastern Tujue as he first was inclined, decided to send Li Yuanji instead. Li Yuanji was given command of much of the army previously under Li Shimin's control, further troubling Li Shimin, who believed that with the army in Li Yuanji's hands, he would be unable to resist an attack. Li Shimin had Yuchi summon Fang and Du back to his mansion secretly, and then on one night submitted an accusation to Emperor Gaozu that Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji were committing adultery with Emperor Gaozu's concubines. Emperor Gaozu, in response, issued summonses to Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji for the next morning, convening the senior officials Pei Ji, Xiao Yu, and Chen Shuda to examine Li Shimin's accusations. As Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji approached the central gate leading to Emperor Gaozu's palace, Xuanwu Gate (ÁéÑÊ≠¶ÈñÄ), Li Shimin carried out the ambush he had set. He personally fired an arrow that killed Li Jiancheng. Subsequently, Li Yuanji tried to kill Li Shimin, but Yuchi killed Li Yuanji instead during the struggle. Li Shimin's forces entered the palace and, under the intimidation of Li Shimin's forces, Emperor Gaozu agreed to create Li Shimin crown prince, and two months later passed the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong). Li Yuanji's five sons were all executed as well. Emperor Taizong also took Li Yuanji's wife Princess Yang as a concubine. Li Yuanji was initially posthumously reduced to commoner rank. After Emperor Taizong took the throne, he posthumously created Li Yuanji the Prince of Hailing, with the unflattering posthumous name of La (meaning \\"ungrateful\\"). In 642, Emperor Taizong changed Li Yuanji's posthumous title to the greater title of Prince of Chao, and adopted his own son, by Consort Yang (Li Yuanji's widow), Li Ming (ÊùéÊòé) the Prince of Cao (note difference in title) into Li Yuanji's line, as Li Yuanji's heir.

S. Bellman, as a temporary hangar capable of being erected or dismantled by unskilled labour with simple equipment and to be easily transportable. Commercial manufacturing rights were acquired by Head Wrightson & Co of Teesdale Iron Works, Thornaby-on-Tees. By November 1938, 10 had even been supplied to Russia. Origins of transportable hangars Bellman hangar at former RAF Stoke Orchard During World War I and for some time after, the only successful transportable hangar design was the Bessonneau hangar. This could be very quickly erected and secured to provide adequate shelter for a few small aeroplanes. But with post-war increases in the number and size of aeroplanes, the need for larger transportable accommodation soon became apparent. The Air Ministry therefore issued a specification in 1936 covering the dimensions and requirements for a light transportable shed for use in war. It had to be end-opening with doors at both ends, be capable of mass production and have interchangeable parts to permit rapid erection and dismantling with minimal permanent foundations. This specification was submitted to various designers and eventually two different designs were presented - the Bellman and the Callender Hangar. An example of each was erected at two demonstration sites (airfields) in the north-east: at RAF Thornaby an Air Ministry design was built (later to be known as the Bellman hangar) and at RAF Usworth a Callender Cable & Construction design was built (later to be known as the Callender-Hamilton hangar). In 1938, the Bellman design was chosen as the standard Air Ministry wartime transportable shed, but Callender-Hamilton hangars were also purchased in small numbers for Royal Naval Air Stations until superseded by a new hangar type in 1943. Construction The Bellman hangar was designed in 1936 by N S Bellman (an Air Ministry Directorate of Works structural engineer) and its general dimensions were 175 ft long, 95 ft wide (87 ft 9in clear width) and 25 ft (clear height). It was constructed in 14 bays at 12 ft 6in centres based on a unit system of rolled steel sections; both walls and roof used the same standard units joined at the junction of wall and roof by a standard corner unit. The time taken for 12 men to erect the hangar at Thornaby, including levelling the ground, laying door tracks, erecting the steelwork, and fitting oiled canvas doors, was 500 man-hours. Two light jib derricks using timber poles were required to erect the fabricated vertical and side members. The roof trusses were assembled on the ground before being lifted into position. As a result of the bad winter of 1937 when a number of Bellman hangars at Thornaby were damaged after a heavy to severe fall of snow, production Bellmans were modified slightly to have steel-framed and steel-clad doors. From 1938 to 1940 some 400 Bellman hangars were built in the UK, some 230 others were manufactured in Australia and probably more were produced under licence in other Commonwealth countries too. Pre-war examples are known to have been built at Brooklands (two for Hawker Aircraft Ltd were supplied by January 1939) and at Croydon Airport (one was provided there for Air Ministry use). Bellmans proved to be invaluable in the early part of the war and met an increasing demand not only to supplement permanent hangars, but also to provide the total hangar requirements for many temporary Armament Training, Elementary Flying Training, and Air Navigation Schools. Hangars were purchased in bulk and in 1938 a central parts storage depot was established at No. 3 MU at Milton, Oxfordshire. The parts for 40 Bellmans were stored in two specially built Bellman sheds for issue in the event of war. When all the hangars had been dispatched, these sheds were used for storing spare parts. Surviving examples in the UK Today, there are believed to be about 100 Bellman hangars still in RAF/MoD service in the UK - including Chivenor, Cosford, St Athan and RNAS Yeovilton airfields. Two examples are preserved in UK aircraft museums - one at AeroVenture near Doncaster, South Yorkshire and another at Brooklands Museum in Surrey. The latter has a clear height of 25 ft (required for dispersed production of Vickers Wellington and Warwick aircraft in World War II), was one of ten erected at Brooklands between 1938 and 1944 and became a designated Grade II Listed building in 1999. Currently the UK's only Listed example, it was recently the subject of a major restoration project supported by a major Heritage Lottery Fund grant, was dismantled in late 2016 then restored off-site before being re-erected in 2017 adjacent to its original location on part of the former Brooklands Race Track's Finishing Straight. Officially reopened to visitors as the Brooklands Aircraft Factory on 13 November 2017, it now houses a comprehensive new exhibition about the aircraft industry at Brooklands and related locations. Others survive at UK civil airports/airfields such as Blackpool Airport, Booker (4), Detling (1), Fairwood Common (Swansea Airport) (1), Halfpenny Green (3), Southend Airport (1),Stoke Orchard (1) and White Waltham (2). Further survivors can be found away from airfields in a variety of alternative uses. Two Bellman hangars still stand at Daedalus Airfield, Lee-on-the-Solent. Both are in use; one storing gliders for Portsmouth Naval Gliding Club, while the other is used by Britten-Norman for client aircraft maintenance. Four Bellman Hangars survive at Jurby Airfield, now disused, on the Isle of Man. One appropriately houses a Transport Museum. There are 09 Bellman Hangers at No 101 Air Logistics Centre, PAF (PAF Base Faisal Karachi Pakistan). No 101 ALC, PAF before partition of Sub Continent was No 1 MU India established in 1918 and later renamed N0 301 MU in 1942. 9 Bellman Hangers were erected in Year 1945-46; and these hangers are still in use of ALC for storage of aircraft stores. Bellman hangars in Australia Bellman hangar at RAAF Base Wagga Maryborough, Queensland, 2008. Port Pirie, South Australia, 2007. Bellmans were also produced in Australia from c.1939 to 1945. They are often stated to have been made by Lysaght, but a history of Commonwealth Engineering reports that Waddington Engineering made over 200 Bellmans from a total of 283 ordered by the Air Ministry in Australia, but the steel within the structures is clearly marked as Lysaght suggesting the materials were sourced by Waddington from Lysaght, possibly explaining the conflicting stories. They were designed as easily transportable, temporary hangars which could be erected using unskilled labour and were used on war-time airfields constructed across Australia, particularly on training airfields. Post war many were removed from temporary wartime airfields as they closed or downsized for civilian use and were relocated to expand or consolidate the permanent RAAF bases, or to establish new civilian airfields. In Victoria the following Bellmans survive: * Four imported UK manufactured examples on the Southern Tarmac at Point Cook (RAAF Williams) These are believed to be the only examples supplied from the UK surviving in Australia. * A further ten Australian-built examples on the Northern Tarmac at Point Cook housing the RAAF Museum (RAAF Williams) (These Bellmans at Point Cook are therefore on the National Heritage List). * Five at the RAAF Laverton base, these are listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List of that base (RAAF Williams) * A further two adjacent to RAAF Laverton base on the road next to the railway, on land excised from the site. * Thirteen at (Moorabbin Airport), having been moved from elsewhere when that civilian airfield was created post war. * Twelve at (RAAF Base East Sale).

(These Bellmans are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register). * Three were at Fishermen's Bend (Victoria) at the site of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation factory. (These have since been relocated to Tyabb Airport). * Two at (Essendon Airport), possibly relating to either DAP aircraft manufacturing or the EFTS operating on the site during World War II. * One at (Mildura Airport), the former No.2 Operational Training Unit. * One at Benalla Airport, the former 11 Elementary Flying Training School under EATS (Empire Air Training Scheme). * One at Nhill Airport, the former No.2 Air Navigator School under EATS. * One at West Sale Airport. * Four at Deniliquin Airport, New South Wales (built as part of the WWII No.7 Service Flying Training School) * About six others were at Tottenham (former RAAF stores) but may have been removed by now. In South Australia the following examples survive: * Three at Parafield Airport, Adelaide, the former No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School 1940-1944. Two have been re-clad, but one which houses the Classic Jets Fighter Museum is in original condition * One at Mount Gambier Airport, the former No. 2 Air Observers School 1941-1946. It has been re-clad * One at Port Pirie Airport, the former No. 2 Bombing and Gunnery School 1941-1943. It is in original condition * One at Waikerie Airport, used by the Waikerie Gliding Club. Others existing in other parts of Australia include: * One at Evans Head Memorial Aerodrome in Northern NSW, is the last remaining example from an original 17 at this historic heritage listed aerodrome and was recently restored as part of a NSW State Heritage endorsed restoration project. The Bellman is now home to the Evans Head Memorial Aerodrome Heritage Aviation Association (www.ehmahaa.org.au). During World War II, this airfield was the largest air training facility in the Southern Hemisphere when home to the RAAF's No. 1 Bombing and Gunnery School and No. 1 Air Observers School (No. 1 BAGS and No. 1 AOS). 5,500 personnel trained on 109 separate RAAF Courses held there. 1,100 of these lost their lives mainly when serving in Britain with Bomber Command on operations over occupied Europe and Germany. This represented a 23% attrition rate compared to the Australian national average during the conflict of 7%. The aerodrome is listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register and this historic Hangar #156 was recently restored to house a former Royal Australian Air Force F-111 fighter jet (A8-147) in Australia's newest aviation museum which was officially opened on 25 August 2013.Evan's Head Memorial Aerodrome Website, accessed 2 January 2013 * Fourteen at RAAF Base Wagga (Forest Hill) central NSW; this is believed to be the largest number of Bellman hangars surviving at one location. * One at Maryborough Airport, Queensland. * Two at RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland, both re-clad. * One at RAAF Base Fairbairn, Canberra Airport ACT. * Three at Macrossan Stores Depot near Charters Towers, Queensland. * One at Jezzine Barracks, Townsville, Queensland. * Two in the General Aviation area at Cairns Airport, Queensland, one of which houses the North Queensland Aero Club and is in almost original condition; the other houses Skytrans and has been altered. * Four at HMAS Albatross (air station) NSW, believed erected when used by the RAAF in 1944. * One at the Army Aviation Centre, Oakey, Queensland. * One at Toowoomba, Queensland, is owned by the Darling Downs Aero Club. * One in Mackay Airport, Queensland, is owned by Chrisair Maintenance. * One occupied on Temora Airport, NSW, by the Temora Aero Club. * One was dismantled and transported from Parkes, New South Wales and set up at Vung Tau Air Base by No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron (5ACS) during the Vietnam War and may still exist.

In 1993 Telecom Australia was renamed Telstra after the merger of Telecom Australia and OTC (Overseas Telecommunications Corporation). A fraction of the thousands of items housed are on display for visitors. One is a working mini telephone exchange with four old phones that can call each other. The visitor can watch the exchange manually step up and click around as the numbers are dialled. The phones have all the original dial tones and rings that were standard for this equipment. Mechanical speaking clock The most significant exhibit is one of the original mechanical speaking clocks, made with rotating glass discs. This is one (number 2) of the four Mark II machines produced in England for use in Australia, which were received in Australia in the early 1950s. The discs were originally read using an exciter and a detector made with valve technology. These devices are no longer available and, because all the originals had failed, replacements had to be fashioned using digital technology adapted to plug into the original valve sockets. This development has enabled the speaking clock to be restored to full operation. The site is managed by volunteers and is open to the public on the 4th Wednesday of the month or by appointment only. A Mark II speaking clock is also on display at the Telstra Museum, Bankstown Sydney, 12 Kitchener Parade, next to the Bankstown Telephone Exchange, which is open to the public every Tuesday and Wednesday. This museum also is run by volunteers. The Brisbane Telstra Museum is at Albion Telephone Exchange, at the corner of Sandgate and Oriel Streets, Albion. Volunteers also run this site, which is open to the public every Wednesday. References External links * * The Postal-Telecommunications Historical Society of Queensland Inc.

The scar tissue accumulates as a result of repeated damage and healing, with the scarring causing a stricture (a narrowing of the lumen of the bowel). The narrowing can force bowel contents into fissures and ulcers at the site, causing additional damage and narrowing. The surgery restores free flow through the bowel without the need for removing bowel segments (i.e., without bowel resection). Strictureplasty was first used in Crohn's disease patients about 30 years ago. The first strictureplasty for Crohn's disease was performed by Emanoel Lee in 1976 and was reported in 1982. The course of the following two decades several papers demonstrated that strictureplasties were safe and effective. Strictureplasties are categorized into three groups: Conventional, intermediate, and complex procedures. The Heineke-Mikulicz Strictureplasty is the most common among the conventional stricutreplasties. Best-suited for short (up to 7 centimeters) strictures, the H-M Strictureplasty is performed by making a cut lengthwise along one side of the bowel, pushing the two ends of the cut together and then suturing the bowel widthwise (picture), thus, having the effect of widening the segment of narrowed bowel, therefore resolving the stricture. The Finney Strictureplasty is the most common intermediate strictureplasty. Indicated for strictures up to 15 centimeters, the Finney Strictureplasty is performed by folding the diseased bowel on itself and creating a large opening between the two loops. For multiple strictures or for longer strictures neither the conventional nor the intermediate strictureplasties are suitable. In these cases surgeons need to use complex procedures. The most common complex strictureplasty is the Michelassi Strictureplasty. In this strictureplasty the long loop of the bowel affected by Crohn's is first divided at its midpoint. The two halves are then moved side to side. A very long opening is created between the two loops, which are then sutured together (Figure 1), (Figure 2), (Figure 3), (Figure 4). Multiple strictureplasty can be performed in the same patient. All strictureplasty techniques spare the patient from bowel resections, an important consideration in a chronic recurrent intestinal condition or in patients with short gut. In addition, recent data suggests that strictureplasty has a protective effect on disease recurrence. Because of the reconfiguration of the bowel, strictureplasty causes slight discontinuities in peristalsis, visible in some imaging tests.

He was the son of Salih ibn Mirdas. Early life and career Thimal was a son of Salih ibn Mirdas, the paramount emir (prince) of the Banu Kilab who founded the Mirdasid dynasty whose territories encompassed the region of Aleppo and the western Jazira. Thimal's birth year, like that of the other Mirdasids, is unknown.Zakkar 1971, p. 87. Like most Muslims of the Aleppo region, the Kilab professed the Twelver Shia doctrine, though to what extent is unclear.Zakkar 1971, p. 84. One indication of Thimal's subscription to the religion was his kunya (paedonymic), \\"Ab≈´  øUlwƒÅn\\", a name associated with Shia Islam. Prior to Salih's capture of Aleppo in 1024, Thimal resided in the fortress of al-Rahba,Zakkar 1971, p. 105. a fortified town on the middle Euphrates that had been in his father's possession since 1008; Salih lived in a tribal encampment on the outskirts of Aleppo. Until the conquest of Aleppo, the Mirdasid court was in al-Rahba, where it was visited by the poet Ibn Abi Hasina in 1019 and 1022.Zakkar 1971, p. 91. In both visits, the poet extolled Thimal and eulogized him as a malik (king). Ibn Abi Hasina was particularly associated with Thimal and noted nearly every event of his life, though many of these events were not recorded by the medieval chroniclers.Zakkar 1971, p. 29. Struggles for power =Power-sharing with Nasr= Thimal moved to Aleppo following its conquest. He was designated by Salih as his walƒ´ al- øa·∏•d (chosen successor) and his name was inscribed accordingly on coinage alongside the names of Salih and the Fatimid caliph, az-Zahir (r. 1021‚Äì1036), whose suzerainty the Mirdasids nominally acknowledged. When Salih was slain by the forces of the Fatimid general Anushtakin al-Dizbari, Thimal may have remained in Aleppo, while his elder brother Nasr managed to escape the Mirdasids' rout.Zakkar 1971, pp. 105‚Äì106. Afterward, Nasr and Thimal abandoned the string of central Syrian cities their father had conquered and concentrated their forces in the territories of Jund Qinnasrin and Diyar Mudar, corresponding with northern Syrian and the western Jazira, respectively.Bianquis 1993, p. 117. They shared power in Aleppo, with Thimal controlling the citadel and Nasr the city. The Byzantine emperor Romanos III perceived the young Mirdasid emirs as weak rulers whose emirate was susceptible to a Fatimid takeover.Zakkar 1971, pp. 113‚Äì116. Thus, he decided to move against the Mirdasids despite the latter's efforts to negotiate a peaceful arrangement. However, the army Romanos led was routed by a much smaller Mirdasid force led by Nasr at the Battle of Azaz in August 1030. During the engagement with the Byzantines, Thimal had remained in Aleppo with the bulk of the warriors of Banu Kilab to defend the city and its citadel should Nasr's cavalry be dispersed.Zakkar 1971, p. 113. The brothers had meanwhile sent away their families to shelter in their tribe's encampments at the outskirts of Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, p. 107. Subsequent to the Mirdasids' victory, Thimal left Aleppo to bring back his family to the city, but during his absence Nasr seized the citadel and became the sole Mirdasid emir of Aleppo. Thimal sought to regain the city and to that end, gained the support of most of the Banu Kilab.Zakkar 1971, p. 108. Most likely in response to this threat, Nasr appealed for Byzantine protection and entered Byzantine vassalage in May 1031. The chieftains of the Banu Kilab ultimately mediated a reconciliation between Thimal and Nasr whereby the former would rule the Upper Mesopotamian portion of the Mirdasid emirate from al-Rahba while Nasr would rule the Syrian portion from Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, pp. 107‚Äì108. =Conflict with the Fatimid governor of Syria= By 1038, Nasr had become embroiled in conflict with al-Dizbari, the powerful Damascus-based governor of Syria. The enmity, dating from al-Dizbari's defeat and killing of Nasr and Thimal's father at al-Uqhuwana, was reignited when the Fatimid vizier al-Jarjara'i engineered the alottment of Homs to Nasr's emirate to al- Dizbari's chagrin.Zakkar 1971, pp. 122‚Äì123. The dismissed Fatimid governor of Homs appealed for al-Dizbari's assistance to oust Nasr, prompting al-Dizbari to launch a campaign against the Mirdasids.Zakkar 1971, pp. 123‚Äì124. Nasr mobilized as many Kilabi warriors as he could and together with Thimal confronted al-Dizbari's troops, whose ranks included numerous Banu Tayy and Banu Kalb tribesmen, near Salamiyah.Zakkar 1971, p. 124. The Mirdasids were defeated and while they regrouped, al-Dizbari sacked Hama north of Homs. The two sides fought again at Tell Fas, near Latmin. During the battle, Thimal fled with his Kilabi loyalists, leaving Nasr and a small core of supporters to be defeated and slain by al-Dizbari.Zakkar 1971, pp. 124‚Äì125. According to historian Suhayl Zakkar, Thimal's intention had been to \\"restore his own position in Aleppo which Nasr had usurped from him an almost similar way\\".Zakkar 1971, p. 125. Nonetheless, he became demoralized at the defeat of his brother and feared he was not in a strong enough position to hold Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, p. 132. He therefore departed the city for the Jazira with his family, including Nasr's wife, al-Sayyida al-Alawiyya bint Waththab, and the latter and Nasr's son Mahmud ibn Nasr. He left his cousin Muqallid ibn Kamil in charge of the citadel and a Kilabi kinsman, Khalifa ibn Jabir, in charge of the city, while he could gather reinforcements from among the Bedouin tribesmen of the Jazira. Al-Dizbari's army ultimately besieged Aleppo and by June/July 1038, had captured it and expelled Muqallid and Khalifa, along with any Mirdasid loyalists left in the city.Zakkar 1971, p. 133. Thimal retained the Mesopotamian portion of Mirdasid emirate,Zakkar 1971, p. 134. but al-Dizbari later captured Balis and Manbij from him, but was unable to take al-Rahba.Bianquis 1993, p. 118. Meanwhile, Thimal had married al-Sayyida al- Alawiyya, Nasr's widow and a princess of Thimal's allies, the Banu Numayr. When her brother Shabib ibn Waththab died in 1039/40, she inherited the twin cities of al-Raqqa and al-Rafiqa and subsequently entrusted them with Thimal. The latter made al-Raqqa his capital in order to remain as close as possible to Aleppo. Emir of Aleppo =First reign= The Fatimid state, guided by al-Jarjara'i, had grown afoul of al-Dizbari's virtual independence and consolidation of power across Syria. Al-Jarjara'i condemned al-Dizbari as a traitor and much of the Fatimid army in Syria abandoned him. He was ultimately forced to leave Damascus for Aleppo, prompting al-Jarjara'i to request that Thimal neutralize him. Moreover, Thimal was formally granted by the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir (r. 1036‚Äì1094) the governorship of Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, p. 138. By the time Thimal mobilized his Kilabi and other Bedouin forces from al- Raqqa to seize Aleppo, al-Dizbari died in January 1042. However, Thimal and Muqallid's troops were refused entry into the city by the a·∏•dƒÅth (urban militia) supported by the Fatimid garrison whose troops defied al-Mustansir's decree.Zakkar 1971, p. 139. Thimal retreated to the Kilabi tribal encampments at Qinnasrin, but within a few days an opportunity arose to take Aleppo when the a·∏•dƒÅth and the Fatimid troops entered into conflict over control of the city. The a·∏•dƒÅth consequently allowed Thimal entry on 22 February, forcing the Fatimid troops to barricade themselves in a palace adjacent to the citadel, which was held by al-Dizbari's former ghilmƒÅn (slave soldiers). Thimal was able to quickly capture the palace, but only captured the citadel after a seven-month siege, after which he was congratulated by al-Mustansir. During his siege of the citadel, Thimal sent envoys to Empress Theodora (r. 1042‚Äì1056) to gain Byzantine protection in return for recognizing Theodora' suzerainty and offering tribute.Zakkar 1971, p. 140. Theodora accepted and bestowed upon Thimal the title of magistros, while conferring lower-ranking imperial titles on al-Sayyida al-Alawiyya and six other members of the Mirdasid household. Thimal thus became a vassal of Byzantium in the same way Nasr had been. In Zakkar's estimation, Thimal had been motivated to seek Byzantine protection out of fears that the Fatimids would at one point or another turn against him. Though al-Mustansir confirmed Thimal's governorship in 1045, tensions between Thimal and al-Mustansir increased when the former only partially restored to the Fatimids the 400,000 or 600,000 dinars left in Aleppo's citadel by al-Dizbari. Further straining ties was Thimal's discontinuation of the annual 20,000 dinar tribute to al-Mustansir. In 1048, al-Mustansir dispatched an army led by the Fatimid governors of Damascus and Homs, Nasir al-Dawla ibn Hamdan and Ja'far ibn Kulayd, respectively, along with auxiliaries from the Banu Kalb, to conquer Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, p. 141. The Fatimid force captured Hama and Ma'arrat al-Nu'man before defeating Thimal outside of Aleppo, forcing the latter to retreat behind the city walls. In the fall of 1048, Ibn Hamdan encamped his forces at Shildi, a village on the Quwayq River in Aleppo's vicinity for the dual purpose of remaining close to the city and having access to a water supply for his troops. However, he was forced to Damascus as a result of heavy losses in men and equipment incurred when the Quwayq flooded his camp during heavy rains. Due to these natural events, Thimal was spared a potential Fatimid siege. Following Ibn Hamdan's withdrawal, Thimal attempted to negotiate a peace with al-Mustansir through the latter's successive Jewish viziers, Sadaqa ibn Yusuf al-Falahi and Abu Sa'd, but both were executed in relatively quick succession. His cousin, Ja'far ibn Kamil, meanwhile went on the offensive and killed Ibn Kulayd at Kafartab, provoking a renewed Fatimid expedition against the Mirdasids.Bianquis 1993, p. 119. This campaign was led by Rifq at the head of a 30,000-strong army including an uneasy mix of regular Berber troops and Bedouin auxiliaries from the Banu Kalb and Banu Jarrah. The Byzantine emperor unsuccessfully attempted to persuade al-Mustansir to halt the advance and consequently dispatched two armies to oversee developments in northern Syria. To prevent their utilization by the Fatimids, Muqallid demolished the fortifications of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man and Hama. In August 1050, Rifq's forces were annihilated by Thimal's Kilabi troops at Jabal Jawshin and Rifq was detained and fatally wounded. After his victory, Thimal sought to avoid further conflict and achieve reconciliation with the Fatimids. To that end, he released all their war prisoners and entered into a mediation brokered by the Fatimid qƒÅ·∏çƒ´ (judge) of Tyre, Ali ibn Iyad.Zakkar 1971, p. 154. The latter persuaded al-Mustansir to accept a Mirdasid delegation headed by al-Sayyida al-Alawiyya and including Thimal's young son, Waththab, in late 1050. The delegates paid the caliph 40,000 dinars, which amounted to two years of unpaid tribute. Al-Sayyida al-Alawiyya declared the Mirdasids' loyalty to the Fatimids and beckoned al-Mustansir to \\"grant peace and protection\\" to Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, p. 78. Al-Mustansir subsequently confirmed Thimal's authority over Aleppo and the other territories of his realm. The peace with the Fatimids contributed to the stability of Thimal's emirate for the next seven years. During this time, Thimal‚Äôs shaykh al-dawla (chieftain of the state), Ibn al-Aysar, oversaw municipal affairs in Aleppo and was Thimal‚Äôs principal representative with the Byzantine emperor and the Fatimid caliph. Annual tributes to both rulers were maintained. Thimal entrusted fiscal policy to a succession of viziers from al-Rahba: Abu‚Äôl Fadl Ibrahim al-Anbari, Abu Nasr Muhammad ibn Jahir and Hibat Allah ibn Muhammad al-Ra‚Äôbani al-Rahbi. The latter two were ‚Äúexperts in public finance‚Äù, according to Bianquis, and had served other Muslim rulers. The inhabitants of Aleppo generally prospered during this period and benefitted from low prices. The city experienced a construction boom in houses, most of which survived until the Mongol destruction of Aleppo in 1260. =Second reign= In 1060, Thimal was in Cairo when he was informed by the caliph that his nephew Rashid al-Dawla Mahmud had seized Aleppo, and as a result the caliph would be retaking the coastal provinces allotted to him. Thimal decided to return to Aleppo, but found Mahmud unwilling to yield control, while another Mirdasid, 'Atiyya ibn Salih, Thimal's brother, had become independent in Rahba. After several military engagements between Thimal and Mahmud, the Kilab came up with a compromise. Mahmud gave up Aleppo to his uncle, in exchange for cash and grain. Thimal therefore reentered Aleppo in 1061. Thimal's second reign lasted little more than a year. He led several successful expeditions against Byzantine positions to the west, between Antioch and Aleppo. He died at the end of 1062. He had named his brother 'Atiyya as his successor, but Mahmud contested this, causing more strife between the Mirdasids.

Around 1200, Hartmann married the heiress to the county of Veringen in Upper Swabia, thus acquiring lands including Altshausen, Burg Alt-Veringen and the county of eastern Apphagaues.

At its peak, his emirate (principality) encompassed much of the western Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), northern Syria and several central Syrian towns. With occasional interruption, Salih's descendants ruled Aleppo for the next five decades. Salih launched his career in 1008, when he seized the Euphrates river fortress of al-Rahba. In 1012, he was imprisoned and tortured by the emir of Aleppo, Mansur ibn Lu'lu'. Two years later he escaped, capturing Mansur in battle and releasing him for numerous concessions, including half of Aleppo's revenues. This cemented Salih as the paramount emir of his tribe, the Banu Kilab, many of whose chieftains had died in Mansur's dungeons. With his Bedouin warriors, Salih captured a string of fortresses along the Euphrates, including Manbij and Raqqa, by 1022. He later formed an alliance with the Banu Kalb and Banu Tayy tribes and supported their struggle against the Fatimids of Egypt. During this tribal rebellion, Salih annexed the central Syrian towns of Homs, Baalbek and Sidon, before conquering Fatimid-held Aleppo in 1025, bringing \\"to success the plan which guided his [Banu Kilab] forebears for a century\\", according to historian Thierry Bianquis. Salih established a well-organized administration over his Aleppo-based domains. Militarily, he relied on the Banu Kilab, while entrusting fiscal administration to his local Christian vizier, policing to the a·∏•dƒÅth (urban militia) under Salim ibn Mustafad, and judicial matters to a Shia Muslim qƒÅ·∏çƒ´ (head judge). His rule was officially tolerated by the Fatimids, to whom he paid formal allegiance. His alliance with the Banu Tayy ultimately drew him into conflict with the Fatimid general, Anushtakin al- Dizbari, whose forces killed Salih in battle near Lake Tiberias. Salih was succeeded by his sons Nasr and Thimal. Early life and career =Family and tribe= Genealogy of Salih ibn Mirdas and the Mirdasid dynasty The year of Salih ibn Mirdas' birth is not known. Both of Salih's parents belonged to noble households of the Bedouin (nomadic Arab) tribe of Banu Kilab. His father was a Mirdas ibn Idris, from a princely clan of the Kilab, specifically from the Rabi'a ibn Ka'b line of the Abd Allah ibn Abu Bakr branch. Nothing else is known about Mirdas ibn Idris. Salih's mother, Rabab al-Zawqaliyya, belonged to the princely Kilabi clan of Zawqal, which inhabited the environs of Aleppo. Salih had at least three brothers, only one of whom, Kamil, is named in sources, and at least four sons, Nasr (d. 1038), Thimal (d. 1062), Atiyya (d. 1071/72) and the youngest whose name is not known (d. 1029). Salih's family inhabited and controlled the town of Qinnasrin (ancient Chalcis), to the southwest of Aleppo. Like most Aleppine Muslims in the 10th‚Äì11th centuries, the Kilab embraced Twelver Shia Islam. Although it is not clear how strongly the tribesmen identified with their faith, Salih's kunya (paedonymic), \\"Ab≈´  øAlƒ´\\" (father of Ali), honored Ali ibn Abi Talib, a central figure in Shia tradition. The Kilab were a major sub-tribe of the Banu Amir and first migrated to Syria from central Arabia during the 7th-century Muslim conquest. They soon became a pillar of the Qaysi tribal faction and established their strongholds in the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) and the steppes around Aleppo, which thenceforth became their diyƒÅr (tribal territory). Through their military strength and consistent ambition to govern and keep order in the territories they inhabited, the Kilab persisted as a powerful force in northern Syria throughout the following centuries. In 932‚Äì933, another wave of Kilabi tribesmen moved to the environs of Aleppo as soldiers of an invading Qarmatian army; according to historian Suhayl Zakkar, the new arrivals \\"paved the way to the rise and establishment of the Mirdasid dynasty\\". By then, the Kilab had established itself as the dominant tribal force in northern Syria and played a significant role in all of the uprisings and internecine fighting involving the Hamdanid rulers of Aleppo, between 945 and 1002. =Emir of al- Rahba= Salih was first mentioned in the historical record when he captured the fortress of al-Rahba (pictured in 2005) in 1008. The fortress as depicted in the photograph dates to the 12th century. Salih is first mentioned in 1008 in relation to the power struggle over the Euphrates fortress town of al- Rahba. The town was strategically situated at the crossroads between Syria and Iraq and frequently contested by local and regional powers. In 1008, Ibn Mihkan, a native of al-Rahba, expelled its Fatimid governor and sought Salih's military backing to uphold his rule. Salih continued to dwell in his tribe's desert encampment, and it is not known what he received in exchange for protecting Ibn Mihkan. A dispute soon arose between Salih and Ibn Mihkan, leading the former to besiege al-Rahba. The hostilities came to an end following an agreement that stipulated Salih's marriage to Ibn Mihkan's daughter and Ibn Mihkan's relocation to Anah, which he would rule in addition to al-Rahba. When Anah's inhabitants revolted against Ibn Mihkan, Salih intervened to reassert his father-in-law's rule. Amid these developments, Ibn Mihkan was assassinated; contemporary chroniclers assume that Salih ordered his death. Salih proceeded to capture al-Rahba and proclaim his allegiance to the Fatimid caliph, al-Hakim. This marked \\"the first step in Salih's career and from which his ambition probably evolved\\", according to Zakkar. His capture of al-Rahba most likely boosted his prestige among the Kilab. =Supreme emir of the Banu Kilab= Between 1009 and 1012, the Kilab participated in the struggle for control of Aleppo between the emirate's ruler Mansur ibn Lu'lu' and its former rulers, the Hamdanids, and their regional backers. Twice the Kilab betrayed the Hamdanids and their allies, and in return, demanded from Mansur numerous pastures to breed their flocks and war horses. Instead, Mansur, who viewed the Kilab as a hindrance to his rule, strove to eliminate them by luring the tribesmen into a trap. To that end, on 27 May 1012, he invited them to a feast. Once the tribesmen entered his palace, the gates were locked and Mansur and his ghilmƒÅn (slave soldiers or pages; sing. ghulƒÅm) attacked them. Several were killed and the rest, including Salih, were imprisoned in the citadel of Aleppo. Afterward, the Kilabi emir Muqallid ibn Za'ida besieged the town of Kafartab to gain leverage with Mansur. This prompted the latter to move the Kilabi prisoners to facilities with better conditions in case of future peace negotiations with Muqallid. Upon hearing of Muqallid's death and his failed siege, Mansur returned the prisoners to the citadel's dungeons, where many among them, including some chieftains, were executed or died from torture or poor conditions. Salih was among those tortured, and was also forced to divorce his wife and cousin Tarud, who was famed for her beauty, so that Mansur could wed her. Zakkar writes that it is not known whether this was meant to humiliate Salih, \\"an energetic and bold\\" emir, or to establish marital ties with other elements of the Kilab. Mansur frequently threatened to execute Salih, who upon being informed of these threats, escaped the citadel. According to the reports of medieval chroniclers, Salih managed to cut one of his shackles and make a hole in his cell wall. Then, on the night of 3 July 1014, he jumped from the wall of the citadel with one shackle still attached to his leg, and hid in a drain pipe for the remainder of the night until joining his tribesmen at their encampment in Marj Dabiq. Zakkar questions the truth of this story, and asserts that it is likelier that Salih escaped through bribery or a friendly arrangement with a guard. Salih's escape boosted Kilabi morale, and they assembled to offer him their allegiance. In the following days, the Kilab under Salih besieged Aleppo, but Mansur's forces were able to plunder their camp and capture fifty tribesmen. Buoyed by his victory, Mansur collected his army of ghilmƒÅn in Aleppo, along with local ruffians, Christians and Jews, and confronted Salih's forces on the outskirts of Aleppo. The Kilab routed their opponents, killing some 2,000 Aleppines in the process, and captured Mansur. Negotiations between Salih and Mansur's representatives ensued, concluding with an agreement that freed Mansur in return for the release of Salih's brothers, a ransom of 50,000 gold dinars, and the allotment of half of the Emirate of Aleppo's revenues to the Kilab. Salih was also able to remarry Tarud and was also given Mansur's daughter to wed. Furthermore, Mansur recognized Salih as the supreme emir of the Kilab, formally investing him with authority and control over his tribesmen. Establishment of Mirdasid emirate =Mesopotamian conquests and struggle for Aleppo= Balis (pictured in 2005) on the Euphrates River. Between 1009 and 1022, Salih laid the foundations of his emirate by capturing a string of fortress towns along the Euphrates, including Balis, Manbij, al-Rahba, Raqqa and al-Rafiqah Using his new-found power, Salih captured the Euphrates towns of Manbij and Balis, located east and southeast of Aleppo, respectively. With these conquests and his control of al-Rahba, Salih established what would become the Upper Mesopotamian portion of the Mirdasid emirate. This crossroads region was agriculturally, commercially and strategically valuable, and put Salih in contact with the Byzantines, the Fatimids and the rulers of Iraq. Meanwhile, the agreement between Salih and Mansur collapsed as the latter abandoned most of his promises, including giving his daughter's hand in marriage and according the Kilab their share of Aleppo's revenues. Salih retaliated by besieging Aleppo, while the Kilab and their Bedouin allies plundered the countryside. Mansur appealed for Byzantine intervention and warned the Byzantine emperor, Basil II (), that if left unchecked, the Bedouin uprising could spread to his territory. Basil dispatched 1,000 Armenian relief troops in response, but withdrew them after Salih informed him of Mansur's treachery and pledged his goodwill to the Byzantines. Basil may have also acquiesced to Salih's activities to avoid provoking Bedouin raids against his territory, which bordered the emirates of both the Kilab and their Numayri kinsmen. The withdrawal of Byzantine troops weakened Mansur's position further and strengthened Salih, who dispatched one of his sons to Constantinople to pay allegiance to Basil. In January 1016, Mansur fled Aleppo after the citadel commander, Fath al-Qal'i, revolted and recognized Salih's emirate and Caliph al-Hakim's suzerainty over Aleppo. According to Aleppine chroniclers, the revolt was coordinated with Salih, who was restored his share of Aleppo's revenues and given custody of the mother, wives and daughters of Mansur; Salih immediately sent the women to join their patriarch, but kept one of the latter's daughters to marry, per their earlier arrangement. Mansur's ouster and the subsequent disorder in northern Syria drove Basil to halt all travel and trade with Syria and Egypt, but Salih persuaded him to exempt Aleppo and the Kilab from these sanctions. To secure his hold over Aleppo, Fath invited Fatimid troops from Afamiyah led by Ali al-Dayf. Al-Hakim bestowed on Salih the laqab of \\"asad al-dawla\\" (lion of the state) and requested that he cooperate with al-Dayf. Salih opposed the Fatimid presence in Aleppo and proposed an arrangement to Fath giving the latter control of the citadel and the Kilab control of the city. Fath responded favorably, but Aleppo's inhabitants protested the rumored deal, demanding the establishment of Fatimid rule; they enjoyed al-Hakim's tax exemptions and opposed Bedouin governance. Fath was compelled to relocate to Tyre by al-Hakim, who also sent reinforcements to Aleppo. Salih was thus prevented from seizing the city. Nonetheless, Mansur's flight and the instability of Fatimid rule enabled him to strengthen his Upper Mesopotamian emirate. He established his own administration and tribal court, which as early as 1019, was visited by the Arab poet Ibn Abi Hasina, who became a prominent panegyrist of the Mirdasid dynasty. Meanwhile, in 1017, al-Hakim appointed Aziz al-Dawla, an Armenian ghulƒÅm, governor of Aleppo. Aziz established friendly relations with Salih and had the latter's mother live in Aleppo to strengthen ties. There is no mention of Salih's activities during Aziz's five-year reign; according to Zakkar, this indicated that Salih \\"was satisfied and remained contented\\" throughout this period. Though Salih was not strong enough to challenge the Fatimids, the Kilab were nonetheless given control of the plains surrounding Aleppo by Aziz. By 1022, Salih had extended his rule to the Euphrates twin towns of Raqqa and al-Rafiqah. In July of that year, Aziz was assassinated, allegedly by his Turkish ghulƒÅm, Abu'l-Najm Badr, who briefly succeeded him. This was followed by a succession of governors with short terms, the last being Thu'ban ibn Muhammad and Mawsuf al-Saqlabi as governors of the city and citadel, respectively. =Formation of the Bedouin alliance= Aziz's replacements were challenged by Salih and chaos prevailed in Aleppo. In 1023, Salih entered the Kilab into a military pact with the Banu Tayy of Transjordan and the Banu Kalb of central Syria, both of which opposed direct Fatimid rule. The contemporary historian Yahya al-Antaki relates that the alliance was a renewal of a previous pact made by the same parties in , since which they rebelled against and ultimately reconciled with the new Fatimid caliph, az-Zahir (), who took power in the aftermath of al-Hakim's disappearance in 1021. The reconciliation unraveled by 1023 owing to the Tayy's conflict with the Fatimid governor of Palestine, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, which prompted the respective chieftains of Tayy and Kalb, Hassan ibn Mufarrij and Sinan ibn Ulayyan, to meet with Salih at the outskirts of Aleppo and renew the alliance. According to the terms of the pact, Syria would be split into three Bedouin-run states, the Kilab under Salih governing Aleppo and northern Syria, the Tayy under its princely Jarrahid household ruling Palestine from al-Ramla, and the Kalb ruling central Syria from Damascus. The combined strength of the three largest tribes in Syria made them a formidable opponent of the Fatimids. A Bedouin alliance of this magnitude and nature had not occurred since the 7th century and was made without consideration to the traditional Qaysi‚ÄìYamani rivalry between the tribes; the Tayy and Kalb were Yamani, while the Kilab were Qaysi. Moreover, its formation surprised Syria's population at the time, who were unaccustomed to the spectacle of Bedouin chiefs seeking kingship in the cities rather than nomadic life in the desert fringe. According to Zakkar, \\"Salih was the outstanding figure among the allies, particularly from a military standpoint\\", though Hassan apparently managed the allies' communications with the Fatimids. In 1023, Salih and his Kilabi forces headed south and helped the Tayy evict Anushtakin's Fatimid troops from the interior regions of Palestine. Afterward, Salih assisted the Kalbi siege of Damascus. The Tayy and Kalb's revolts in Palestine and Jund Dimashq (Damascus Province), respectively, \\"supplied the impetus\\", according to Zakkar, for Salih to move on Aleppo, particularly as the Fatimids' grip on that city had been weakened. While he fought alongside his allies in the south, his kƒÅtib (secretary), Sulayman ibn Tawq, captured Ma'arrat Misrin in Aleppo's southern countryside from its Fatimid governor. In November, Salih returned to Aleppo in the belief that its defenders would immediately surrender to him, but this did not occur. He then withdrew and mobilized his tribal warriors and other local Bedouin. =Conquest of Aleppo= Map of the Mirdasid domains, highlighted in yellow, at their greatest extent during Salih's rule in 1025 In October 1024, Salih's forces, led by Ibn Tawq, advanced against Aleppo and fought in sporadic engagements with the Fatimid troops of governors Thu'ban and Mawsuf. Salih arrived at Aleppo‚Äîafter having sacked several Syrian coastal districts‚Äîwith large numbers of Bedouin warriors on 22 November. He besieged the city, first camping outside of Bab al-Jinan, where his demand for the surrender of Ibn Abi Usama, the city's qƒÅ·∏çƒ´ (head Islamic judge), and other notables was refused. He then gathered more troops and engaged Aleppo's defenders for over fifty days, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. On 18 January 1025, the Bab Qinnasrin gate was opened to Salih by Salim ibn al-Mustafad, head of the city's surviving Hamdanid ghilmƒÅn; Ibn Mustafad had defected from the Fatimids after a quarrel with Mawsuf, and together with numerous townsmen and other former ghilmƒÅn, he welcomed Salih, who granted the inhabitants aman (safe conduct). Afterward, Salih had the towers of the city walls demolished. According to the contemporary Egyptian chronicler al-Musabbihi, this led the local populace to believe Salih was preparing to hand over Aleppo to the Byzantines; fearing this, they fought alongside Fatimid troops and briefly ousted Salih's forces, killing some 250 Kilabi warriors. Zakkar views Salih's destruction of Aleppo's towers as a tactic that would enable an easier reconquest of the city should his troops be ousted. On 23 January, Salih besieged the citadel, where Mawsuf and his troops were ensconced, while Thu'ban and his garrison barricaded themselves in the governor's palace at the foot of the citadel. By 13 March, Salih entered the palace and allowed the townspeople to loot it. As his Bedouin troops were not accustomed to siege warfare, he requested skilled forces from the Byzantine governor of Antioch, Constantine Dalassenos, who dispatched three hundred bowmen to Aleppo; the troops were soon after recalled on the orders of Basil II, who did not support Salih's rebellion. On 5 May, Salih appointed Ibn Mustafad muqaddam al-a·∏•dƒÅth (commander of the urban militia) and governor of Aleppo, entrusting him and Ibn Tawq with continuing the siege, while Salih left for Palestine to help the Tayy combat a renewed expedition by Anushtakin. The Fatimid garrison's appeal for a truce on 6 June was ignored, prompting their desperate calls for Byzantine assistance; the troops went so far as to hang Christian crosses on the citadel walls and loudly praise Basil II while cursing Caliph az-Zahir. Muslim townsmen reacted to the pro-Byzantine pleas by joining the siege. By 30 June, the citadel was breached and Mawsuf and Thu'ban were arrested. Meanwhile, Salih and the Tayy had fended off Fatimid troops in Palestine. On his way back to Aleppo, Salih captured a string of towns and fortresses, namely Baalbek west of Damascus, Homs and Rafaniyya in central Syria, Sidon on the Mediterranean coast and Hisn Ibn Akkar in the hinterland of Tripoli. These strategically valuable towns gave Salih's emirate an outlet to the sea and control over part of the trade route between Aleppo and Damascus. The fall of Sidon, in particular, alarmed the Fatimids, who had largely prioritized control of Syria's port cities over the inland towns and feared that other ports would subsequently recognize Bedouin rule. In September, Salih entered Aleppo's citadel victoriously. Afterward, he had Mawsuf and Ibn Abi Usama executed, and confiscated the estates of numerous upper class Aleppines. He released Thu'ban in return for financial compensation and allowed the city's dƒÅ øƒ´ (chief Isma'ili propagandist) to depart safely. Emir of Aleppo General view of old Aleppo (foreground) and its citadel (background), 2008. Aleppo was the capital of Salih's Mirdasid emirate. The citadel as depicted in the photograph dates to the 12th century. Despite his rebellion, Salih paid formal allegiance to the Fatimid Caliphate after conquering Aleppo, and dispatched Ibn Tawq to meet az-Zahir in Cairo; in turn, az-Zahir officially recognized Salih's Mirdasid emirate and sent him numerous robes of honor and presents. There is no information about the Byzantines' relationship with Salih following the conquest of Aleppo, though Emperor Basil II refused to back Salih's rebellion when he appealed for support. =Administration= According to the 13th-century historian Ibn al-'Amid, \\"Salih put in order all [the state] matters and adopted the way of justice\\". Salih organized his emirate along the typical lines of a medieval Islamic state. To that end, he maintained the fiscal administration, appointed a vizier to administer civilian and military affairs, and a Shia qƒÅ·∏çƒ´ to oversee judicial matters. He also appointed deputies to govern Sidon, Baalbek, Homs, Rafaniyya and Hisn Ibn Akkar. His vizier was a Christian named Tadhrus ibn al-Hasan, who wielded considerable influence over him, according to Ibn al-'Adim, and accompanied Salih on all of his military campaigns. Aleppine Christians would largely monopolize the post of vizier under later Mirdasid rulers, and members of the community managed significant parts of the emirate's economy. Their major role in the emirate indicated Salih's reliance on local Christian support, the existence of a large Christian minority in Aleppo and an effort to establish friendly ties with the Byzantines. The influence of Tadhrus in securing Christian interests provoked communal tensions in the emirate. Amid Muslim‚ÄìChristian clashes in Ma'arrat al-Nu'man in 1026/27, Salih imprisoned Muslim notables from the town on charges of razing a winehouse whose Christian owner was accused by a Muslim woman of molesting her. Salih later released them after the intercession of the poet al-Ma'arri, whose brother was among the prisoners. Information is largely absent regarding any major administrative changes Salih made to the Emirate of Aleppo. His only known institutional innovation was the post of shaykh al-dawla (chieftain of the state) or ra æƒ´s al-balad (municipal chief), who came from a prominent leading family and served as Salih's trusted confidant and permanent representative with the people of Aleppo. The post emulated that of the sheikh, who played a secondary role to an emir in a princely Kilabi clan. Salih appointed Ibn Mustafad to the post and utilized the latter's a·∏•dƒÅth, which consisted of armed young men from the city's lower and middle classes, as a police force. Although they cooperated with Salih, the a·∏•dƒÅth were still an independent force. Sometime during his reign, Salih also acquired some Turkish ghilmƒÅn, though details about them are lacking in the sources. =Influence over the Bedouin= According to historian Thierry Bianquis, Salih had \\"brought to success the plan which guided his [Kilabi] forebears for a century\\", and that he ruled with \\"concern for order and respectability\\". At its core, Salih's emirate was held together by Kilabi tribal solidarity, and indeed the Kilab were the backbone of the Mirdasid army. Though Salih previously established his paramountcy over the Kilabi chieftains, the Mirdasids were not the only princely clan of the tribe and several emirs from other clans demanded a stake in the emirate. Salih granted each of these emirs an iq·π≠ƒÅ ø (fief; pl. iq·π≠ƒÅ øat), though details about the size or specific holders of the iq·π≠ƒÅ øat are absent in contemporary sources. Bedouin customs were a conspicuous feature of Salih's rule, and he always appeared publicly in the garb of a Bedouin chieftain rather than that of an urban leader. Moreover, Salih preferred to live in his tribal camp in the outskirts of Aleppo rather than the city itself. After his establishment in Aleppo, Salih's status increased among the Bedouin of Syria and Mesopotamia. He was sometimes referred to by Arabic chroniclers as amƒ´r  øarab al-ShƒÅm (commander of the Bedouin of Syria). The value of this title in Salih's time is unclear, but it \\"at least indicate[d] the high position of its holder\\", according to Zakkar. Besides his leadership of the Kilab and influence over the Tayy and Kalb in Syria, Salih's influence also extended to tribes in the Jazira, including the Numayr. When two Numayri emirs lost Edessa to Nasr al-Dawla, the Marwanid emir of Mayyafariqin, they appealed for Salih's intervention; accordingly, he persuaded Nasr to restore Edessa to the Numayr. Furthermore, the Banu Munqidh first emerged as a political force in the Orontes valley under his patronage in 1024/25. At that time, Salih awarded the Munqhidi chieftain Muqallad ibn Nasr ibn Munqidh the feudal lands around Shayzar as an iq·π≠ƒÅ ø for supporting his conquest of Aleppo, but the town of Shayzar itself was controlled by the Byzantines. Death and aftermath Salih was killed in battle near the eastern shore of Lake Tiberias (pictured in 2014). Between 1025 and 1028, the Fatimids reached an agreement with Salih's Jarrahid/Tayyi allies, allowing them to maintain their foothold in interior Palestine, while Anushtakin was recalled to Cairo. In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants. Moreover, the Fatimids would not permanently tolerate independent rule in Palestine: as Egypt's gateway to Southwest Asia, this posed a threat to the Caliphate's survival. Meanwhile, as the Fatimids regrouped, the Kalb had been repelled from Damascus, and in 1028, their emir died. He was replaced by his nephew, Rafi ibn Abi'l-Layl, who defected to the Fatimids, thus weakening the tripartite Bedouin alliance. In November 1028, Anushtakin returned to Palestine with a large Fatimid army and more horsemen from the Kalb and Banu Fazara to drive out the Tayy and evict the Mirdasids from central Syria. With the Fatimids and Kalb poised against him, Hassan appealed for Salih's help to maintain their tribes' virtual autonomy throughout Syria against Fatimid encroachment. Accordingly, Salih mobilized his Kilabi forces to reinforce the Tayy in Palestine. The Bedouin leaders first encountered the Fatimid‚ÄìKalb army in the vicinity of Gaza, but, unable to halt their advance, they withdrew to the north. On 12 May or 25 May 1029, the two sides fought at al-Uqhuwana, on the eastern shores of Lake Tiberias. For unknown reasons, Hassan and his forces fled in the heat of battle, leaving Salih and his men to face Anushtakin's army alone. The Kilab were decisively defeated and Salih, his youngest son and his vizier were slain. After the battle, Salih's head was sent to Cairo and put on display, while his body was nailed to the gateway of Sidon, a town he had enjoyed residing in. The Fatimids proceeded to conquer Sidon, Baalbek, Homs, Rafaniyya and Hisn Ibn Akkar from Salih's deputy governors, who all fled. Salih had designated his second eldest son, Thimal, as his successor and left him in charge of Aleppo. His eldest son, Nasr, who fought at al-Uqhuwana, escaped the battle to wrest control of Aleppo. For a brief period, the two sons ruled Aleppo jointly with Nasr controlling the city and Thimal the citadel, until sometime in 1030 when Nasr compelled Thimal to relocate to al-Rahba. In 1038, Anushtakin killed Nasr and seized Aleppo, but Thimal later restored Mirdasid rule in the city, which continued, with occasional interruption, until 1080. The fall of the Mirdasids was followed by the reign of the Uqaylid Arab prince Muslim ibn Quraysh whose death in battle against the Seljuk Turks in 1085 signaled the definitive end of Arab rule in Aleppo, the virtual disappearance of Arab tribes from Syria's political scene and their replacement by Turkish and Kurdish dynasties.

He was the eldest son of Salih ibn Mirdas, founder of the Mirdasid dynasty. Nasr fought alongside his father in the battle of al-Uqhuwanah near Tiberias, where Salih was killed by a Fatimid army led by Anushtakin al-Dizbari. Afterward, Nasr ruled the emirate jointly with his brother Thimal. The young emirs soon faced a large scale Byzantine offensive led by Emperor Romanos III. Commanding a much smaller force of Bedouin horsemen, Nasr routed the Byzantines at the Battle of Azaz. Following his victory, he ousted Thimal from Aleppo and entered into Byzantine vassalage, while attempting to maintain ties with the Fatimids. He nominally recognized Fatimid suzerainty in 1037 and was concurrently given control of Hims, which the Mirdasids had lost several years prior. Anushtakin, who had become governor of Syria, objected to Nasr's acquisition of Hims; in 1038, his forces marched against Nasr and killed him during a battle in Hama's environs. Thimal succeeded Nasr, but Aleppo fell to Anushtakin weeks later. Mirdasid rule was restored and continued with some interruption until 1080. Nasr renovated the Aleppo Citadel and made it his seat of power. Under the direction of his local Christian vizier, Aleppo was expanded and urbanized to accommodate an influx of Muslims from the countryside. Nasr's rule was limited to the northern Syrian portion of the emirate, while the Mirdasids' Upper Mesopotamian fortresses were controlled by Thimal. Though relations with his Banu Kilab tribe were strained at times, Nasr secured strong ties with the Banu Numayr by marrying the Numayri princess al-Sayyida Alawiyya. From her, he had his only known son, Mahmud, who ruled Aleppo in 1065‚Äì1075. Early life and career Nasr was the eldest son of Salih ibn Mirdas,Zakkar 1971, p. 105.Crawford, p. 91. the supreme emir of the Banu Kilab tribe and founder of the Mirdasid dynasty. By 1025, Salih's Aleppo- based Mirdasid emirate covered much of northern Syria, western Upper Mesopotamia and the central Syrian towns of Sidon, Ba'albak and Hims. Though he ruled independently, Salih nominally recognized Fatimid suzerainty over his emirate. However, in 1029, he supported his ally, Hassan ibn Mufarrij, the Jarrahid emir of the Banu Tayy, against a Fatimid army led by Anushtakin al- Dizbari.Zakkar 1971, pp. 100‚Äì101. In May 1029, the two sides fought at the battle of al-Uqhuwanah near Lake Tiberias, which ended in a rout for the Bedouin allies, the deaths of Salih and his youngest son, and the subsequent loss of the Mirdasids' central Syrian possessions. Nasr fought alongside his father, but escaped al-Uqhuwanah and returned to Aleppo, where his younger brother, Thimal, had been left to administer affairs in his father's absence.Crawford, p. 92. It is evidenced by the two surviving coins minted during Salih's reign that Thimal had been designated as Salih's walƒ´ al- øahd (chosen successor) as late as 1028/29, the year before Salih's death. However, in the aftermath of al-Uqhuwanah, Nasr and Thimal apparently ruled Aleppo jointly, with Nasr based in the city and Thimal in the citadel.Bianquis 1993, p. 117. In the aftermath of their defeat at al-Uqhuwanah, the Mirdasids lost Sidon, Baalbek, Hims, Hisn Ibn Akkar and Rafaniyya, and concentrated their forces in Jund Qinnasrin and western Diyar Mudar. Conflict with the Byzantines The Battle of Azaz, miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes The youth and inexperience of Nasr and Thimal was viewed by the Byzantine katepano of Antioch, Michael Spondyles, as an opportunity to establish a protectorate over the Mirdasids' domains and prevent the reestablishment of Fatimid rule in the wake of Salih's death.Zakkar 1971, p. 109. Spondyles sent an expedition against Aleppo; however, Nasr and Thimal, leading their Kilabi tribesmen, ambushed and routed the Byzantine force at Qaybar (in Aleppo's western countryside) in July 1029. In the aftermath, Spondyles was dismissed by Emperor Romanos III (r. 1028‚Äì1034), who resolved to avenge the Byzantine loss, install his ally Mansur ibn Lu'lu' in place of the Mirdasids,Zakkar 1971, p. 111. and in the process, achieve a glorious military victory over the Arabs.Zakkar 1971, p. 110. Romanos III arrived at Antioch with a 20,000-strong army, composed mostly of mercenaries,Zakkar 1971, p. 115. on 20 July 1030,Zakkar 1971, p. 112. and sent a messenger to Nasr and Thimal demanding they cede Aleppo to him.Zakkar 1971, pp. 111‚Äì112. Nasr rejected the demand, detained the envoy and sent his own diplomatic mission, led by his cousin Muqallid ibn Kamil, to persuade Romanos to desist from attacking Aleppo. Nasr's envoys told Romanos that the Mirdasids had not given the Byzantines any pretext for war and maintained the Byzantine protectorate and alliance per the treaty of 969. They also related that they were prepared for war should Romanos continue his offensive against Aleppo. Nasr's envoys were detained and Romanos continued his march, setting up camp outside Azaz, to the northwest of Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, p. 113. Nasr and Thimal, meanwhile, evacuated their families from the city, and mobilized the Kilab, the Banu Numayr and other Bedouin tribes, as well as local Muslims from Aleppo and its hinterland. The bulk of the Mirdasid force remained with Thimal to defend Aleppo and its citadel, while Nasr and some 700‚Äì900 Bedouin horsemen left to confront the Byzantines.Zakkar 1971, p. 114. Romanos, whose army was encamped in a barren plain during the summer heat, sent a force to survey the fortress of Azaz, but these troops were all killed or captured by the Mirdasids.Zakkar 1971, p. 116. Romanos subsequently decided to withdraw toward Byzantine territory. Disorder soon spread throughout the Byzantine camp, with Armenian mercenaries looting the camp's market and trench guards fleeing for safety. Nasr and his Kilabi warriors used this opportunity to launch a surprise sortie against the retreating Byzantine troops. The latter were decisively defeated and chaotically dispersed. According to the contemporary Byzantine historian Michael Psellus, Romanos \\"himself was almost captured and made prisoner by the enemy [Mirdasids]\\", who, \\"as if amazed at the sight of the Romans [Byzantines] routed and fleeing for no reason, merely stood and watched this outstanding triumph\\".Zakkar 1971, p. 117. Emir of Aleppo =Seizure of power= Nasr seized the Aleppo Citadel from his brother Thimal in 1030, and became sole ruler of Aleppo. He added numerous living quarters and reception halls to the citadel and made it his residence and seat of power. Nasr opposed Thimal's appointment and sought to take sole control of Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, pp. 105‚Äì106. There are two accounts about Nasr's seizure of power, both agreeing that Nasr took the Aleppo citadel while Thimal was away. In the first account by Ibn al-Adim, Nasr and his men seized the citadel by force when Thimal was in the Kilabi tribal camps in Aleppo's outskirts attempting to persuade his estranged wife to return to the city.Zakkar 1971, p. 106. In reaction, Thimal mobilized his Kilabi loyalists with the goal of retaking Aleppo by force, but the arrival of Romanos's forces spurred the Kilabi chieftains to mediate the dispute between Nasr and Thimal.Zakkar 1971, p. 107. In the ensuing agreement, Nasr would control the Syrian portion of the emirate from Aleppo, while Thimal would rule the Mesopotamian portion from al-Rahba on the Euphrates River. The second account by Yahya of Antioch, and also cited by Ibn al-'Adim, holds that Nasr's coup took place after the Battle of Azaz. Accordingly, when Thimal left Aleppo to bring back his family to the city after Nasr's victory over the Byzantines, Nasr took control of the citadel in his absence. Historian Suhayl Zakkar asserts that this account was the more likely scenario,Zakkar 1971, pp. 107‚Äì108. particularly since Nasr immediately appealed for Byzantine forgiveness and protection, offering an annual tribute of 500,000 dirhams, despite his decisive victory over Romanos at Azaz;Zakkar 1971, p. 108. Zakkar explains that Nasr's spontaneous offer to the Byzantines must have come as a result of Kilabi dissent or threats toward his rule organized by Thimal in response to the latter's ouster. =Byzantine vassalage and Fatimid relations= Romanos accepted Nasr's offer and declared the Emirate of Aleppo a vassal of the empire, obliging the Byzantines to back and protect Nasr in case of aggression. Nasr's vassalage with the Byzantines became the principal sticking point in Byzantine‚ÄìFatimid peace negotiations, which commenced in 1031.Zakkar 1971, pp. 119‚Äì120. While Romanos adamantly sought to include Nasr's emirate in the proposed treaty, he died and was replaced in 1034 by Emperor Michael IV (r. 1034‚Äì1041); the latter was more conciliatory toward Fatimid concerns.Bianquis 1993, p. 118. Thus, when negotiations concluded in 1036 with a ten-year truce (hudna), the issue of Aleppo was excluded entirely.Zakkar 1971, p. 120. According to Zakkar, \\"It would appear that Byzantium, which by this Treaty, had solved most of its problems with the Fatimid Caliphate, lost interest in Aleppo, or at least no longer deemed it to be of the same political importance.\\" Map showing Nasr's emirate of Aleppo (bottom right corner) as a protected vassal of the Byzantine Empire The Byzantine‚ÄìFatimid treaty weakened Nasr's strategic position and forced him to improve relations with the Fatimids. As early as 1030, Nasr sought Fatimid approval of his rule and dispatched an envoy carrying a large amount of war booty from Azaz to Caliph az-Zahir. In turn, the caliph accepted Nasr's authority in Aleppo, at least for the time being. However, there is no indication that Nasr paid the Fatimids tribute.Zakkar 1971, p. 121. Nasr's envoy remained in Cairo for several years and likely did not return to Aleppo until after the accession of Caliph al-Mustansir (r. 1036‚Äì1094). Zakkar speculates this indicated discord between Aleppo and Cairo due to Nasr's continued tribute to Byzantium instead of to the Fatimids or Fatimid reservations at Nasr's request for the governorship of Hims. Following the 1036 treaty, Emperor Michael IV mediated between Nasr and al-Mustansir by advising the former to accept the Fatimids' conditions, which are not known;Zakkar 1971, pp. 121‚Äì122. indeed, the contemporary chroniclers provided scant information about Nasr's relations with the Fatimids between 1030 and 1036.Zakkar 1971, p. 122. The chroniclers do mention that Nasr's envoy returned to Aleppo in 1037 with a diploma giving Nasr the governorship of Hims, as well as gifts and robes of honor from al-Mustansir, whose suzerainty was nominally acknowledged by Nasr.Amabe 2016, pp. 64‚Äì65. Al-Mustansir also bestowed on Nasr the noble titles of mukhta·π£ al-umara, khƒÅ·π£tu æl-imƒÅm, shams al-dawla wa majdihƒÅ and dhu æl-azƒ´matayn, in addition to his previous title of shibl al-dawla. =Fortifications= Nasr moved the seat of the emirate to the Aleppo Citadel, marking a change from previous tradition whereby Aleppo's rulers were based in a palace in the city or its outskirts. This \\"brought about the erection of magnificent apartments and reception halls\\" in the citadel, which thenceforth became the residence of Nasr and later rulers of the city.Zakkar 1971, pp. 106‚Äì107. To make up for the loss of Hisn Ibn Akkar to the Fatimid governor of Tripoli in 1033, Nasr strengthened Hisn al-Safh (the future Krak des Chevaliers) on the northern end of the Hims Gap, opposite of Hisn Ibn Akkar.Salibi 1977, p. 108. He garrisoned the fortress with Kurdish tribal auxiliaries, hence its more common Arabic name \\"Hisn al-Akrad\\". =Domestic affairs= Upon seizing power, Nasr, like his father, appointed an Aleppine Christian, al-Mu'ammal al-Shammas, as vizier to administer civilian and military affairs.Bianquis 1993, p. 117.Amabe 2016, p. 66. During Mirdasid rule, a large influx of peasants and nomads from the countryside moved to the city of Aleppo, resulting in the establishment of crowded quarters and suburbs within and outside the city's walls. Al-Mu'ammal, aided by his brother, oversaw the urbanization of these suburbs and the construction of mosques and hammams (bathhouses) to accommodate the new arrivals. Nasr consecrated ties with the Numayrids by marrying al-Sayyida Alawiyya, sister of Shabib ibn Waththab, the Numayrid emir of Harran; the Numayrids were distant kinsmen and traditional allies of the Banu Kilab and the Mirdasids. As a result of his vassalage to the Byzantines, Nasr provoked the opposition of Salim ibn al- Mustafad, Aleppo's municipal chief and leader of the ahdath (urban paramilitaries), appointed during Salih ibn Mirdas' reign.Kennedy 2004, p. 260. Ibn al-Mustafad stirred a rebellion among the ahdath and the lower and middle class residents of the Zajjajin quarter in protest at the alliance.Amabe 2016, p. 66. This prompted the Byzantine governor of Antioch to request Nasr kill Ibn al-Mustafad. Accordingly, Nasr had Ibn al-Mustafad arrested and executed in 1034. =Downfall and death= Nasr's acquisition of Hims in 1037 came at the expense of its Fatimid-appointed, Berber governor, Ja'far ibn Kulayd al-Kutami, who was concurrently dismissed from the governorship.Zakkar 1971, pp. 122‚Äì123. Ibn Kulayd appealed for the assistance of the Damascus-based, Fatimid governor of Syria, Anushtakin al-Dizbari. The latter was already perturbed by the expansion of the Mirdasid realm to Hims, which would give the Byzantine-backed Mirdasid‚ÄìNumayrid alliance full control of the lowland regions and routes between the Iraqi frontier and the Mediterranean Sea. Al-Dizbari relayed his concerns to the Fatimid court, which was effectively run by Ali al-Jarjara'i, the power behind the throne. It was al-Jarjara'i who had granted Nasr the governorship of Hims partly to check al- Dizbari's power and territorial ambitions in Syria. Al-Dizbari did not await Cairo's response, and he and Ibn Kulayd mobilized their forces to assert direct Fatimid rule over northern Syria. Al-Dizbari's army was bolstered by troops from the Banu Kalb and Banu Tayy, as well as a dissident faction of the Banu Kilab.Zakkar 1971, p. 124. Moreover, al-Dizbari gained Byzantine permission to take Aleppo provided he maintain the emirate's annual tribute. Upon hearing of al-Dizbari's campaign against him, Nasr mobilized his local and Kilabi forces, including Thimal and his loyalists, and set out to confront the Fatimid coalition. Nasr's force was defeated in a battle just west of Salamiyah, and withdrew toward Hama to regroup. Meanwhile, al-Dizbari's troops attacked and plundered Hama and moved against Nasr's camp. On 22 May 1038, the two sides fought at Tell Fas, a site immediately west of Latmin in Hama's northwestern countryside.Zakkar 1971, pp. 124‚Äì125. During the ensuing battle, Thimal and his men abandoned Nasr and his core loyalists, who were left to face the much larger Fatimid coalition. Thimal's reason for fleeing is not definitively known, though he likely used it as an opportunity to wrest back control of Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, p. 125. Nasr, meanwhile, was \\"killed fighting bravely\\", according to historian Hugh N. Kennedy; his head was given to al- Dizbari and his body was displayed on the gate of the Hama Citadel. Thimal succeeded Nasr as emir of Aleppo, but, fearing al-Dizbari's northward advance, left the city shortly after in the company of Nasr's children, Shabib ibn Waththab and Nasr's widow al-Sayyid Alawiyya, who Thimal later married. Thimal entrusted governance of the city and citadel to his kinsmen, Khalifa ibn Jabir al-Kilabi and Muqallid ibn Kamil, respectively.Zakkar 1971, p. 132. These governors surrendered the city to al-Dizbari's forces in June 1038, following a siege. With this, al-Dizbari brought all of Syria under direct Fatimid administration for the first time.Zakkar 1971, pp. 132‚Äì133. Mirdasid soldiers and officials were consequently expelled from Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, p. 133. However, in 1042, al-Dizbari died and Thimal restored Mirdasid rule over the city with al-Jarjara'i's backing.

Located on the banks of the Air Itam (\\"Black Water\\") River, the earliest of the two buildings is notable for having served as the residence of Francis Light, the founder of the first British settlement on Penang. Following Light's death in 1794, and with Penang becoming the fourth presidency of India in 1805, a newer Suffolk House replaced the original house, assuming multiple roles before it was later neglected and subsequently restored.  History  Suffolk House in 1811 = As Light's residence = The original Suffolk House served as Francis Light's residence and has been described as a simple Anglo-Indian Garden House style of timber and attap construction, built within his pepper estate called Suffolk. Light lived on the estate until his death in 1794. = Service to Colonial Britain = Entrance hall of Suffolk House. On the purchase of the land from Light's estate in 1805, William Edward Phillips began the works of a Georgian-styled mansion called Suffolk Park. He was not, at the time of the mansion's construction, governor to the island, but became so in later years. It was an ostentatious statement in a settlement with barely 120 European residents, many of whom were trades people and merchants. The mansion subsequently served as the residence of several more early governors for less than a quarter century, including William Edward Phillips' father-in-law, Governor Bannerman, amongst other Governors of Penang and the Governors of the Straits Settlements. The mansion also served as a venue for social and official functions. During the 1810s and 1820s, the mansion was a Government House that assumed the role as a meeting place for critical political discussions, including, most notably, discussions with Stamford Raffles regarding the founding of Singapore. = Service to the Methodist Boys' School = Suffolk House viewed from the northwest. The annexe is visible in the background. The mansion remained in use as a governor's residence until the completion of The Residency in 1890, after which it was relegated to general government functions before being sold to Mr. Lim Cheng Teik. In 1928, Mr Lim sold the building and land to Reverend P.L. Peach of the Methodist Church of Malaya for $40,000 (Straits Settlement dollars) for the purpose of housing the Anglo-Chinese High School, later to become the local Methodist Boys' School. A smaller school building containing 12 classrooms was built near the original North Porch of the mansion in 1955. In 1956, the Methodist Church submitted plans to have Suffolk House demolished and to have new school buildings built over it. The then President of the Municipal Council, Mr. John Sjovald Hoseasom Cunnyngham-Brown, persuaded the school to retain the mansion but build on the rest of the land. The main school building and another wing was completed later in 1956. The building assumed various roles through its 46 years of ownership by the Methodist Church. In 1931, Standard Six students were transferred into the building, before the entire Primary School (Standards 1-6) eventually moved into it in 1945. World War II saw the building temporarily occupied by the Japanese administration. A dental clinic was later added into the building in 1953, and it also served as the Old Tuckshop (school canteen) until 1975. The building's rapid deterioration was noted since the 1950s, and in 1975, the building was declared unsafe and was vacated. Between then and its restoration in the 2000s, the building's roof and upper floor had collapsed. = Restoration = View of the modern annexe of Suffolk House with the Methodist Boys' School in the background. Since 1961, campaigning has existed to restore the mansion. Through the years, various efforts to restore the house were hampered by complications, including problematic land transfers and waning interest. In 1993, the Penang Heritage Trust conducted structural studies and stabilisation works on the buildings with assistance from the SACON Heritage Unit, an organisation based in South Australia (Adelaide, the capital of South Australia, was surveyed and laid out by Francis Light's son, William Light). The Suffolk House Committee was also formed by the Penang state government. In 2000, the Methodist Boys' School was given a neighbouring plot of land from the state government in exchange for the land on which Suffolk House stood. Restoration work began in November 2000, but funds by the state government were only sufficient to provide stabilisation steel work, repair the central jack roof timbers over the ball room and retile the pitched jack roof. From 2004 onwards, rehabilitation work were aided by further state funding and donations from HSBC (of RM 2.5 million) and various parties. An estimated RM 5 million was needed to restore and refit the mansion. = Reopening to the public = A tour group viewing the restaurant at the restored Suffolk House. After years of anticipation, Suffolk House finally opened its doors to the public in 2009. The house is being managed by YKH Group of Restaurant under the watchful eyes of Badan Warisan Malaysia, a non-government organisation, which is concerned with the conservation and preservation of Malaysia's built heritage. The house and garden are open for public walkabout daily and guided tours are on offer.  Dispute over construction and ownership  First-floor colonnade terrace at Suffolk House with modern netting installed. The first owners of the Suffolk House remains has been disputed, as to whether the present house was built for Light or Phillips. Light's will indicates that he bequeathed his common-law wife, Martina Rozells, \\"...the pepper gardens with my garden house, plantations and all the land by me cleared in that part of this island called Suffolk...\\", which does not provide proof that his house resembled in any way the current Suffolk House. Historian F. G. Stevens, one of the main authorities on the early development of Penang, pointed out in a 1929 article \\"A Contribution to the Early History of Prince of Wales Island\\" that the road leading to the house from Air Itam Road was only \\"lined out but not made\\" in 1807, discounting the possibility that the house could have been built before then. Australian historian Marcus Langdon believes that Suffolk House was built by Phillips, who was also the owner of Strawberry Hill, on Penang Hill, and not David Brown. Architecture Cutaway model of Suffolk House. The original house was simply a humble timber-and-attap garden house, fashioned in a simple Anglo-Indian Garden House style formerly common in British India. The current Suffolk House is a detached double-storey building of Euro-Indian Georgian styling.

It is home to one of the first on-campus high school fish hatcheries and aquaculture programs in the state. Academics In 2008, 86% of the school's seniors received their high school diploma. Of 70 students, 60 graduated, eight dropped out, and two were still in high school the following year. Fisheries program The Fisheries Program at WHS started as the \\"fish farm club\\" and became the aquaculture class in the early 1960s. The program was conceived and began in the late 1950s. It started with rearing salmonids in buckets and releasing them into the on-campus Skipanon River, and grew to eventually being one of the pioneers of netpen rearing in the Pacific Northwest, with the first netpens built in the 1960s. Warrenton was founded under water and after its diking and incorporation as a city, it still was mostly wetland. The fish rearing operation had only a 2\\"x6\\" wide wooden catwalk as the only means of reaching the operation, until the early 1970s when the Oregon National Guard cleared and built a road to the pump shed. The first on-campus fish hatchery was built in 1974 by the aquaculture, shop, welding, and PE classes alongside community volunteers directing the engineering. During the early to mid-1980s, the operations expanded to the Warrenton Municipal Sewer Ponds in the form of netpens. This operation recorded extremely high growth rates. The fish were tested and later released. The test results revealed that the fish were healthy and consumable, despite their environment.http://www.dailyastorian.com/Main.asp?SectionID=2&ArticleID;=70485 A new fisheries rearing and research facility was built by Warrenton High Fisheries, Inc.

His father, a wealthy industrialist, did not support his son's desire to be an artist. When his father died, Okada entered the department of Western painting at Tokyo School of Fine Arts, called today Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, but in 1924 left for France where he studied with fellow Japanese expatriate Tsugouharu Foujita, executing paintings of urban subjects. In 1927, he exhibited work in the Salon d'Automne. In the same year, he returned to Japan and within a year he had his first one-person show at the Mitsukoshi Department Store in Tokyo. His success continued with a prize in 1936 from the Japanese contemporary artist group Nikakai Group, of which he went on to become a lifetime member. He taught at the School of Fine Arts, Nihon University from 1940 to 1944, but was evacuated to Mori village in the Miyagi Prefecture, later returning to Tokyo to teach at the Musashino Art University. A realist painter in Japan, in 1950 he moved to New York City, where he produced abstract paintings. Undoubtedly stimulated by abstract expressionism, these paintings nevertheless display a strong Japanese sensibility and feeling for form. In 1953, he began to exhibit his abstract expressionist paintings with the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York City, and through Parsons, gained access to the inner circle of Abstract Expressionism.Papanikolas, Theresa and Stephen Salel, Stephen, Abstract Expressionism, Looking East from the Far West, Honolulu Museum of Art, 2017, , p. 17 His paintings from the 1950s and 1960s reveal subtle changes in the natural world through the use of imagery constructed with delicate, sensitive color tonalities, floating within the compositional space. Turn from 1962, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, and Hagoromo from 1966, in the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection, are examples of the artist's tonal abstractions. During the 1970s he painted numerous works that used as a point of departure the reinterpretation of the decorative effects of traditional Japanese painting. Okada evokes the aura of landscape by using earth colors, abstract patterns hinting at rocks and flowers, and an overall haziness that makes his scenes look submerged in water. Bringing an Asian sensitivity to the New York School of abstraction, Okada distills the essence of nature into his painting, making it seem elemental and thus sublime. Okada became friends with Mark Rothko and many other abstract expressionists, especially the early color field painters. His sensitive and personal style of abstract expressionism, with his Asian roots, relates directly to both color field painting and lyrical abstraction. Okada died in Tokyo July 24, 1982.

Its primary objective is to support projects in the natural and computer sciences as well as mathematics. The KTS places strong emphasis on the public understanding in these fields. Klaus Tschira‚Äôs commitment to this objective was honored in 1999 with the \\"Deutscher Stifterpreis\\" by the German National Academic Foundation (German: Studienstiftung). The KTS is located at the Villa Bosch in Heidelberg, Germany, the former residence of Nobel Prize laureate for chemistry Carl Bosch (1874‚Äì1940). Activities The foundation mainly initiates academic and non-profit, non-academic research projects in the natural sciences, computer sciences and mathematics. It supports teaching and research at public and private universities as well as projects involving children and young people. Its main goal is to arouse public appreciation for natural sciences, to engage in research for the benefit of society and to present science in an understandable format for the general public. Furthermore, upon application, the foundation supports projects in line with the mission of the foundation. The main goals of the organization have been set as: *Promoting fascination for science *Research for the benefit of society *Understandable science. In 2013, the Klaus Tschira Stiftung established the Heidelberg Laureate Forum Foundation (HLFF). The HLFF organizes the annual Heidelberg Laureate Forum, an event in Heidelberg, which gives a select group of young researchers the opportunity to meet pre-eminent scientists from the fields of mathematics and computer science. Science for young people The foundation induces children and young people to be enthusiastic and curious about natural phenomena. =Forscherstation= The Forscherstation is the name of the Klaus Tschira Competence Centre for Early Science Education. It seeks to instill kindergarten children and their caretakers with enthusiasm for the natural sciences. Children are encouraged to playfully explore natural phenomena from their immediate environment. The explorer station is a research facility of the college of education Heidelberg. It also investigates the effects of further training on the teacher‚Äôs development of competence and the children‚Äôs learning processes. =GIS-Station= The GIS-Station is the Klaus Tschira Competence Centre for digital geographical media. It offers learning opportunities in the fields of remote sensing, geographical information systems and GPS. With this, the station seeks to support teachers' and students' skills in using digital geographical media. This is based on the assumption that digital geographical media will help students to better explore the earth and facets of global change. The project is attended by the college of education Heidelberg. =Explore Science= Every year since 2006, the Klaus Tschira Foundation has been hosting science adventure days in Luisenpark, Mannheim. Children, students, teachers and parents are able to go on natural scientific expeditions with competitions for students, oral presentations, as well as experiments and hands-on exhibitions. A different scientific theme is chosen for Explore Science each year. Research  Another main goal of the foundation‚Äôs work is the use of research results for the benefit of society. Therefore, the foundation supports young academics, conducts its own research and sponsors projects of other institutions initiated by the Klaus Tschira Foundation. =Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies= In January 2010, the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS) opened its doors as the successor of the European Media Laboratories (EML) Research, which was founded in 2003. As a sister institute of the application-oriented EML, it has the agenda to engage in long-term oriented, fundamental scientific research, irrespective of popular trends. The investigators come from the following fields: life sciences, scientific databases and computational linguistics, theoretical astrophysics, statistic methods and computational sciences. In the future, up to ten research groups are envisioned at HITS. The institute pursues an interdisciplinary and cooperative approach. =Klaus Tschira Laboratory= The Klaus Tschira Laboratory for physical age determination is an institution of the Reiss Engelhorn Museum Mannheim and a related institute of the University of T√ºbingen. Humanistic considerations regarding the dating of artwork are examined with the aid of natural scientific methods such as radiocarbon dating. Understandable science To support the a better understanding of the natural sciences by the general public, the Klaus Tschira Foundation supports journalists and scientists in developing communicative skills in this matter. =KlarText!= Since 2006, the Klaus Tschira Stiftung has been looking for young scientists who write a generally understandable article (8,000 to 10,000 words) in German about their research and the content of their PhD thesis. The prize is awarded in each of the categories biology, chemistry, information technology, mathematics, neurosciences and physics as well as in closely related fields. Participation is open to young scientists graduating within the previous year with excellent research results. Contributions are judged for scientific quality and public understanding by a panel of experts on science and communication, respectively. With this competition, the Klaus Tschira Stiftung pursues the goal of advancing public appreciation of the natural sciences, mathematics and information technology. The ability to communicate is fundamental to making innovative research findings accessible to an interested but rather unspecialized public. Yearly, up to six winners receive the award endowed with prize money of ‚Ç¨ 5,000. Furthermore, the prize-winning contributions are released in the supplementary issue of the popular science magazine Bild der Wissenschaft (German). All competitors are offered a participation in a one-day workshop for science communication. The Klaus Tschira Prize was first awarded from 1996 to 1999, but at the time was restricted to graduates from the University of Karlsruhe. The competition was revived in 2005 and since 2006 has been open to participants nationwide. =NaWik= The National Institute for Science Communication (NaWik) trains students and scientists for the dialogue with the general public. The NaWik is an institute of the Klaus Tschira Stiftung and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.  External links  *Klaus Tschira Foundation *KlarText!

While his father and teacher discuss his aggressive behavior, his six-year-old sister, Lucy, suffers a heart attack caused by constrictive pericarditis. Over the course of the episode she develops more symptoms that are usually only exhibited by elderly people, such as arthritis and a stroke. Exploring the patient's house, they find a bloody T-shirt stuffed into a heating vent. Suspecting child abuse at first, the team runs tests and finds that the girl has been menstruating at the age of six. Shallow cuts around the genital area found in a previous exam were attributed to her trying to remove pubic hair with her father's razor. House and his team are baffled, but the breakthrough comes when Jasper, who is eight, goes into a rage when Chase acts affectionately towards Cameron on whom the boy had a crush. It turns out that both children had been affected by their father's sexual-enhancement cream and were going through puberty early. Their father had been using the cream to \\"keep up\\" with his much younger girlfriend, who is his children's teacher.

It is primarily found growing around the rims of tide pools, but can be found in shallow crevices anywhere on the rocky shore that are regularly refreshed with sea water. It predominantly grows on the lower shore, especially where fucoid algae are absent, but is also found further up shore on exposed coasts. It forms calcium carbonate deposits within its cells which serve to strengthen the thallus. These white deposits cause the seaweed to appear pink in colour, with white patches where the calcium carbonate is particularly concentrated, such as at the growing tips. The calcium carbonate makes it unpalatable to most rocky shore grazers. Description L., herbarium sheet. Collected in Heligoland, Germany The thallus of C. officinalis is firmly attached generally to rock and grows in tufts to a length of 120mm. It has articulated pinnate branching with successive opposite lateral branches.Newton, L. 1931. A Handbook of the British Seaweeds. British Museum (Nat. Hist.)

Insignia and uniform The collar badge of the regiment comprised the figure 16 above a scroll inscribed \\"Queen's Lancers\\", over a pair of crossed lances and surmounted by a crown. The lancer full dress cap bore the regimental battle honours and number in silver. In its early years as the 16th Light Dragoons, the regiment wore the standard red uniform of this branch of cavalry with black and then royal blue facings. In 1784 the red coat was replaced by a dark blue jacket. From 1816 to 1832 a dark blue lancer uniform was worn, until in December 1832 a scarlet coatee and undress jacket was authorized for all lancer regiments as part of a general policy to make red the national military colour. In 1840 it was ordered that Light Cavalry should revert to the blue uniforms formerly worn. Sir John Vandeleur petitioned that the regiment might be permitted to retain their scarlet coatee and on 2 March 1841, his request was granted.Sumner, p. 116 The scarlet uniform was worn by the regiment during the First Sikh War and on their return to England in 1846, they remained the only Lancer regiment not to resume the blue jacket of the light cavalry.

He was promoted captain on 10 September 1890, and major on 1 April 1900. On the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, Wyndham went to South Africa where he served on the Staff, and was present at the Relief of Ladysmith. During the later parts of the war he was in command of a Column. For his services he was mentioned in despatches (including the final despatch by Lord Kitchener dated 23 June 1902), and received the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel on 29 November 1900. He returned to the United Kingdom on the steamer Dunvegan Castle in April 1902, and the residents of his home village of Upwey, Dorset had decorated the village on his arrival there. Two months later, he was received in audience by King Edward VII, who personally presented him with the King's South Africa Medal. As British military attach√© in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1909 he first warned his Austrian counterpart that an Austrian General Staff officer was supplying top secret information to the Russians. This information, however, ended up on the desk of Alfred Redl, head of counter-intelligence at the Evidenzbureau in Vienna, who unfortunately was the very spy being sought.

It has rough, fibrous or flaky bark on the trunk and branches, egg-shaped, elliptical or more or less round leaves, flower buds arranged in groups of seven to fifteen or more, white flowers and conical, hemispherical or cup-shaped fruit.  Description  Eucalyptus populnea is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous or flaky, greyish bark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth grey bark that is shed in short ribbons from the thinner branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped to almost round, dull greyish green leaves that are long and wide. The crown has leaves that are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, egg-shaped, elliptical or more or less round leaves that are long and wide tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are mostly arranged on the ends of branchlets in groups of seven to fifteen or more, on a branched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oblong to spherical, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs from August to December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical, hemispherical or cup-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level.  Taxonomy  Eucalyptus populnea was first formally described in 1858 by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society, Botany. The specific epithet populnea is a Latin adjective referring to the poplar-like foliage.https://www.anbg.gov.au/gnp/interns-2002/brachychiton-populneus.html The common names bimble box and bimbil box are from the Wiradjuri name for the species. Other common names recorded include round-leaf box, red box, white box, egolla, nankeen gum, round-leaved box and shiny-leaf box. In 1990, Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill described two subspecies, populnea and bimbil but the names have not been accepted by the Australian Plant Census. Hybrids with E. populnea have been recorded but only one, Eucalyptus populnea F.Muell. √ó Eucalyptus thozetiana (F.Muell. ex Maiden) R.T.Baker is accepted at the Australian Plant Census.  Distribution and habitat Poplar box is widespread in New South Wales where it is found on the western plains north from Narrandera and Pooncarie, extending into Queensland as far as Rockhampton. It is most abundant in the northern and central sections on the western plains, becoming gradually less common the New South Wales far west, where it is restricted to areas that are more reliably watered and sandier. This eucalypt is most commonly found on red soils with a sandy loam to clay loam texture, growing in association with gum coolibah (E. intertexta), grey box (E. microcarpa) and white cypress pine (Callitris glaucophylla). It can be found less commonly on sandplains composed of deep loamy sands, where it will be found growing with ironwood (Acacia excelsa) and mulga (Acacia aneura). In the far west of New South Wales it grows in small terminal drainage depressions with sandy soils overlying clay at depth.  Ecology  It is a favoured food tree for koalas in the range where it occurs.  Uses  The flowers of E. populnea produce honey of a good quality, but of limited supply, and which is very dense and pale amber in colour. The timber has been found to be durable and hard and is suitable for fence posts and construction work. However it is not any easy to work timber and is susceptible to white ant attack. It is a suitable species for a windbreak, as it can be propagated easily and is not difficult to establish. It is an excellent fuel, producing a great deal of heat and burns cleanly.  Conservation  Although it is widespread, the conservation status of E. populnea and allied plant communities is poor. Along the eastern edge of the species' distribution, only a small remnant of some communities occur on the better soil types. There are also a number of minor communities which only occur in limited areas, with very few of these represented in conservation areas such as national parks or nature reserves. Protected areas in which significant populations can be found include the Yathong Nature Reserve in New South Wales.

While the original foundation of the cathedral was in 1605, making it the oldest Catholic church in Beijing, the current building in Baroque style dates from 1904.Clark, Anthony E. \\"China's Thriving Catholics: A Report From Beijing's South Cathedral.\\" Ignatius Insight August 20, 2008. The present Archbishop Joseph Li Shan, installed in September 2007, is one of the few Catholic bishops also recognized by the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Church. The church has been closed for repairs since 10 December 2018. History The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, as a foundation, dates back to 1605, in the 33rd year of the reign of the Wanli Emperor of the Ming dynasty. When the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci arrived in Beijing, the Wanli Emperor permitted him a residence slightly to the west of the site of the current cathedral, near Xuanwumen. Attached to this residence was a small chapel, in Chinese style, with only the presence of a cross atop the entrance to distinguish it as a church. This was at the time referred to as the Xuanwumen Chapel (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶Èó®Á§ºÊãúÂ†Ç). In 1650, in the seventh year of the reign of the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty, under the leadership of the German Jesuit Johann Adam Schall von Bell, work on a new church building was begun on the site of the Xuanwumen Chapel. Construction of was complete in two years, and the new church received the honour of a Ceremonial gateway with the words 'Respect the Teachings of the Way of Heaven' (Èí¶ÂÆóÂ§©ÈÅì). The Shunzhi Emperor was friendly to Schall and the church, visiting it no less than 24 times, bestowing upon it a stone stela with the words 'built by Imperial Order' (ÊïïÂª∫) inscribed upon it. In 1690, Beijing received its first Roman Catholic bishop in three hundred years, the Franciscan Bernardin della Chiesa, and the church became a cathedral. In 1703, in the 24th year of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor, the cathedral was enlarged and renovated, and after ten years, a European-style building was complete, the second European-style building in Beijing after the Canchikou church. This was destroyed in 1720 by an earthquake in Beijing. A new cruciform structure was built in the baroque style, with a length of 86 metres and width of 45 metres. This was again severely damaged by an earthquake in 1730, in the eighth year of the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, who donated 1000 taels of silver towards its repair. The repaired cathedral had larger and taller windows, resulting in a brighter and grander interior. The cathedral was damaged by fire in 1775, the 40th year of the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, who donated 10,000 taels of silver for restoration work, and also bestowed a calligraphed board in his own hand, inscribed with the characters '‰∏áÊúâÁúüÂéü' on it, meaning 'The True Origin of All Things'. In 1838, in the 14th year of the reign of the Daoguang Emperor, due to constant conflicts with the power and influence of the Catholic Church, for the sake of peace, the Qing government decreed a restriction of the activity of the Catholic Church in China. In this decree, the cathedral was confiscated by the government and remained such until the end of the Second Opium War, when the Catholic Church was again permitted to act freely. The cathedral was reopened in 1860 under the leadership of Bishop Joseph Martial Mouly. When the Boxer Rebellion broke out in 1900, all the churches of Beijing were targets of vandalism, and on 14 June 1900, the cathedral was razed to the ground, together with most other churches of Beijing. In 1904, the present structure, the fourth church on the site, was completed. On 21 December 1979, Bishop Michael Fu Tieshan was consecrated in the cathedral, the first major event in the life of the Catholic Church in China after the Cultural Revolution. The cathedral is possibly the best known to foreigners in China, as English- language masses are celebrated there. Current masses The cathedral is currently (April 2019) closed for renovation and the English Mass is being held at 14:00 (2 P.M.) in the North Church. The Italian/Spanish mass is at 10:00 (10 A.M.) in an outbuilding of the South Cathedral. There is a Chinese Mass at 08:30 (8:30 A.M.). Masses before the Cathedral was closed for renovation Masses are held in multiple languages. Weekday masses are held Monday to Saturday in Latin at 06:00, and then in Mandarin at 06:30 and 07:15. On Saturday, there is a vigil mass at 18:30 in Mandarin that is a \\"youth mass\\". On Sundays, there are mass in Latin at 06:00, and Mandarin at 07:00, 08:30, 16:00, and 18:00.

Lucas became the Greek Consul General to Australia in 1921, then Consul in Melbourne in 1931‚Äì46. Early years Born Antonios Ioannis Gerasimos Lekatsas on 18 October 1862, he was the second child of Ioannis Lekatsas (a priest) and his wife Magdalene Palmos. Migrating just before his younger brother Marino Lucas (Marinos Lekatsas) from their hometown of Exoghi (Exogi) on the Greek island of Ithaca in 1886, the young man quickly began to build his fortune. In 1894 Lucas opened the Town Hall Caf√© in Swanston Street, the main thoroughfare of Melbourne, opposite the Town Hall. Often employing Greek staff and spanning two floors, the caf√© serviced over five hundred diners at any one time.  Prosperity  Lucas subsequently opened two more restaurants in the early 1900s, both in 'the block', the north side of Collins Street between Swanston and Elizabeth Streets, which was the most fashionable part of the city - the Paris Caf√© (at about no. 240) and the Vienna Caf√© (a few doors down at 260 Collins Street). These ventures prospered under Lucas' keen entrepreneurial skills. During World War 1, when anti-German sentiment was at a fever pitch, with German street names changed and German social clubs closed, the name of the cafe drew protests, especially when the Austrian eagle appeared on the wine list in June 1916. According to 2016 Age article even worse had occurred: > \\"In 1915, a group of drunken soldiers, incensed that the Vienna Cafe bore > the name of the enemy, stoned the premises and threatened its patrons. > Lekatsas closed the cafe and hired Chicago architect, Walter Burley Griffin > and his wife, Marion Mahony Griffin, to remodel it. Griffin was in Australia > to oversee the building of Canberra. The contract also allowed him to set up > private practices in Melbourne and Sydney.\\" Having purchased the adjoining building in 1915, Lekatsas quickly implemented his plans to rebuild and expand his cafe, and responded to the prevailing mood by naming the venture the Cafe Australia. The cafe was re-opened in only five months on November 1916 at a gala event attended by prominent Melburnians, including opera singer, Nellie Melba. The guests were stunned by the arched quartz entrance, the piers with reliefs of Greek goddesses, the marble stairway to the grand banquet hall, the murals of Australian pastoral scenes, and the avant-garde design of the furniture, among many other striking features. The renovations arguably marked the beginnings of modernist architecture in Australia. . In the early 1920s Lekatsas, now known as Anthony Lucas, joined forces with the American Phillips brothers, who had been behind the development of Luna Park in seaside St Kilda, to demolish the Town Hall Cafe and build Melbourne's first large scale elaborate picture palace, known as the Capitol Theater. He again employed the Griffins to design both the theatre and the ten storey office building placed above, and when the theatre opened on 7 November 1924, the unique crystalline interior and coloured lighting was considered a marvel. The Capitol has subsequently achieved heritage status as one of the most avant-garde theatres in the world, and is now registered with the Australian Heritage Commission, the National Trust and Heritage Victoria. With reference to the journal The 200 years History of Australian Cooking, Tess Malos claims that Lucas also ran an open-air restaurant in the public gardens of the inner Melbourne suburb of Kew. The 1916 'Life in Australia' publication by John Comino had a significant section devoted to AJ Lucas, some of which follows: > \\"24 years have flowed (since his arrival in Australia) and, properly used by > a great, capable and audacious man, such as Mr. Antonios Lekatsas is, have > resulted in the acquisition of substantial wealth. Three splendid, smart and > exquisite buildings, of a commercial nature and part of the property owned > by him, together with another building of twelve storeys, the tallest in > Australia, standing by Sydney Central Railway Station and bearing the name > ‚ÄúAustralian Buildings‚Äù, sing the praises of the splendid abilities of Mr. > Antonios Lekatsas, who is the richest of the Greeks settled in the State of > Victoria.\\" Initially residing on the top floor of the Town Hall Caf√©, Lucas was wealthy enough by 1918 to purchase the Toorak mansion Whernside. This property was subsequently owned by Jewish immigrant and business tycoon Solomon Lew. In 1928 Lucas moved to the large property Yamala on the Mornington Peninsula, where he again employed the Griffins to redesign the house and gardens.  Religious and Ithacan Interests  Lucas helped found and was frequently the head of the Greek Orthodox Church in Melbourne and was also the President of the Ulysses Philanthropic Society of Melbourne ('Antonis Lekatsas' was the first president of the Ithacan Philanthropic Society) from 1916 until 1923. He was also opposed to the thinking of Archbishop Knitis and Consul-General Chrysanthopoulos in the Greek Church dispute of the 1920s. During the 1920s, genocidal massacres following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire saw millions of people displaced from what is now Turkey. Thousands of Orthodox fled to Australia during this period. In July 1924, the Greek Orthodox Metropolitan Christoforos Archbishop Knitis of Australia and New Zealand arrived but by 1929 he had been deposed and was exiled to Samos. Lucas' opposition to Knitis created a degree of conflict with Andreas Papadopoulos, author of the International Directory: O Diethnis Emporikos Odigos, a huge publication of over 600 pages published in 1927 by International Publishers of Adelaide. The compilation of this journal was primarily instigated and financed by Georgios Nikolaidis, who was also the founder of a short-lived Greek newspaper Okeanis in Adelaide and by G. Hetrelezis. Papadopolous had married Angeliki Papadopoulou, also from Ithaca and a niece and god-daughter of Antony Lucas.  War Effort  At the height of World War II, Lucas organised a programme whereby Melbourne's Greeks donated a day's pay to the Greek war effort. On 1 May 1941 an Italian annexation of Ithaca had begun and by late September 1943, the subsequent German occupation commenced, although this lasted just over one year. Lucas was also an avid supporter of the Lord Mayor's Hospital Appeal. He personally donated ¬£10,000 to a fund which he organised for Greek and British child war-victims and in 1939 was awarded the Golden Cross of Taxiarchon, an order initiated by Greece's King George I. In October 1944 a special service to commemorate his birthday and the coincident liberation of Athens was conducted in the Greek Orthodox Church in Victoria Parade.  Later life  In later life he was director of several companies and was said to be the richest Greek-Australian in the country. He died in Sydney on 10 August 1946, leaving an estate valued for probate at nearly ¬£134,000. He was buried with Greek Orthodox rites in Melbourne general cemetery; his six daughters survived him.

The factory was under construction from 1943 to March 1945 using forced labour, but was damaged by air-raids and unfinished by the end of the war. The Valentin factory was the largest fortified U-boat facility in Germany, and was second only to those built at Brest in France. As a manufacturing facility, it differed from conventional U-boat pens, which were designed to house and service operational U-boats. Construction A roof truss of U-boat bunker \\"Valentin\\" is lifted into place (1944) Production of U-boats by German shipyards had been dramatically reduced as a result of bombing by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces, necessitating the creation of bomb-proof production sites. Many such sites were in use in 1944, including the U-boat pen Nordsee III on the German island of Helgoland, Fink II and Elbe II in Hamburg and Kilian in Kiel. Other sites in Germany and other occupied countries were under construction or planned, such as Hornisse in Bremen, Elbe XVII and Wenzel in Hamburg, Wespe in Wilhelmshaven, Kaspar in Kiel. Under the codename Valentin a submarine factory was to be built directly on the Weser river between the Bremen suburbs Rekum and Farge. It was intended the facility would be used for the final assembly of Type XXI submarines, starting in April 1945 with three boats and from August 1945 a monthly delivery of a minimum of 14 boats. A second bunker called Valentin II was planned as well. The bunker is around long and wide at its widest point; the walls are thick. The height of the structure is between . The roof was constructed using dozens of large, reinforced concrete arches, manufactured on-site and individually lifted into place. Most of the roof is around thick but part of it is thick as the Germans began adding to its thickness before the bunker was even completed. Construction required of concrete. The design and oversight of the Valentin's construction was carried out by the Organisation Todt. Marineoberbaurat Edo Meiners was in charge overall; the on-site supervising engineer was Erich Lackner. He had a lengthy post-war career, becoming one of Germany's most prominent civil engineers. By March 1945, the facility was 90% completed and the most of the necessary machine tools had been installed. Production of U-boats was due to begin within two months. Planned use Plan of Valentin, taken from the 1946 US Air Force report on the results of Project Ruby After completion, the bunker would have had a work‚Äìforce of around 4,500 slave workers. Under the management of the Bremer Vulkan shipyard, it would assemble U-boats. Each would be built from eight, large, pre-fabricated sections manufactured in other shipyards such as Bremer Vulkan, Deschimag AG Weser with its bunker Hornisse, Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven with bunker Wespe and Deschimag Seebeckwerft in Bremerhaven, and then shipped to Valentin on barges. The bunker was to house 13 assembly bays (calledTaktplatz in German, or Takt for short), each carrying out one part of the assembly process. Two bays, Takt 9 and Takt 10, were underneath box-like structures on the roof that allowed the extra height needed for the installation of periscopes, snorkels and antennas. The two last bays, Takt 12 and Takt 13, were separated by high walls from the rest of the building and could be closed by water-tight floodgates. Takt 13, the final bay, was a dry dock with an deep pool of water. The two separated bays could be flooded to give a total water depth of about 20 metres from the bottom of Takt 13's dry dock to the water-surface at the building's roof-level. Takt 13 was to be used for leak‚Äìtests of the completed U-boats as well as engine starts and other tests. In addition to the 13 assembly bays, the bunker housed workshops and store-rooms for the prefabricated sections, diesel-engines and batteries, and storage tanks for fuel and lubricants. The gateway in the western wall could be closed by means of a sliding bomb-proof door which opened to a small canal, a creek and then directly onto the Weser river. Through this, sections of submarine would be delivered by barges and completed submarines could leave. Operations at Valentin were intended to commence by late 1944, but was postponed to mid-1945 due in part to a combination of manpower and supply shortages and bombing. It is likely that production would have been limited due to the severe quality control problems experienced with the prefabricated sections. Albert Speer (the Reich armaments minister) had directed that the sections be made by inland companies and then assembled at the shipyards so as to ease production. However, these companies had little experience in shipbuilding resulting in lengthy re-working to rectify flaws in the sections. Out of the 118 boats completed, only four were rated fit for combat before the war ended in Europe. Labour force The partially completed Valentin bunker and some of its prisoner work‚Äìforce (1944) Most of the 10,000‚Äì12,000 people who built Valentin were slave workers, who lived in seven camps located between from the bunker. Some were housed in the nearby Bremen-Farge concentration camp, the largest subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp complex, with 2,092 prisoners as of March 25, 1945. The camp facility was erected close by at a large naval fuel oil storage facility; some prisoners were accommodated in an empty underground fuel tank. Among the labourers were mainly non‚ÄìGerman concentration camp inmates (Fremdarbeiter) as well as Russian, Polish, and French prisoners of war, but also some German criminals and political prisoners.These were befristete Vorbeugungsh√§ftlinge (\\"temporary preventive custody prisoners\\"); some were prisoner functionaries. The \\"Camp Elder\\" was Erich Meissner, a German political prisoner (described by another ex‚Äìprisoner as a brutal alcoholic), who became mayor of Leipzig post‚Äìwar. See Neuengamme / Bremen-Farge, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The camp was initially run by the SS, but the expansion of the camp network in the area led to a shortage of personnel. By mid-1944, the camp was commanded by an army captain, Ulrich Wahl, and the prisoners were guarded by a detachment of naval infantry. Only a handful of SS men remained involved in the running of the camp. Work on the bunker took place around the clock, with personnel forced to work 12-hour shifts from 7am to 7pm. This resulted in a high death rate amongst the prisoners. However, the identity of only 553 victims, mostly Frenchmen, has been confirmed. The total number of deaths may be as high as 6,000 as the names of the Polish and Russian dead were not recorded. The worst work on the site was that of the so-called iron detachments (Eisenkommandos), responsible for the movement of iron and steel girders. A French survivor, Raymond Portefaix, stated that a prisoner's life expectancy fell dramatically on being assigned to one of these detachments. He described the Eisenkommandos as suicide squads. The prisoners held at the Neuengamme concentration camp and its subcamps were evacuated in April 1945, just before the capture of the area by the British army. Many were placed on board the SS Cap Arcona. This German ship was heavily laden with around 5,000 concentration‚Äìcamp prisoners when she was attacked and sunk by the RAF on 3 May 1945; only 350 prisoners survived. The sinking took place just one day before the German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath, the unconditional surrender of German forces in the Netherlands and North-West Germany. It is estimated that more than 6,000 workers died during the building of Valentin. Bombing Grand Slam bomb strike Interior of Valentin ‚Äì the figure standing on the pile of rubble gives scale The Valentin factory was attacked by the RAF on 27 March 1945. The attacking force consisted of twenty Avro Lancaster heavy bombers of 617 Squadron which had, after the \\"Dambusters\\" raid, developed precision bombing methods. Simultaneously, a force of 115 Lancasters bombed the nearby fuel oil storage depot in the village of Schwanewede. The bombers were escorted by ninety RAF North American Mustang fighters of 11 Group The Lancasters attacking Valentin each carried a single large earthquake bomb ‚Äì seven carried the 5 ton 'Tallboy', thirteen carried the 10 ton 'Grand Slam'. Two 'Grand Slam's hit the target and penetrated about half-way through the thick ferrous concrete roof before exploding. The explosions blew large holes in the remaining thickness of the roof and brought down around 1,000 tons of debris into the chamber below. Workers who were inside the bunker at the time survived, as the bombs did not penetrate the roof before detonating. Another bomb caused damage to a nearby electricity plant, workshops and a concrete mixing plant. Fortunately for the British, the two bombs struck and penetrated the thick west section of the roof. Post‚Äìwar American analysis suggested the thick, east section would have been able to resist even the Grand Slams, although not without significant damage, and it is unlikely that it would have survived repeated hits. Three days later, on 30 March, the US Eighth Air Force attacked Valentin with Disney bombs. These were large () weapons with hard steel casings, rocket-assisted to increase their penetrating power. Sixty were launched but only one hit the target, causing little damage. However, considerable damage was done to installations surrounding the bunker. The factory was abandoned, and four weeks after the bombing, the area was occupied by the British Army's XXX Corps, which captured Bremen after a five-day battle. Post war The 1983 memorial, Vernichtung durch Arbeit, commemorating the deaths and suffering of those who built Valentin After the war, when the already installed machine tools had been removed, further bombing of Valentin was carried out. Beginning in March 1946, Project Ruby was a joint Anglo-American affair to investigate the use of penetration bombs against heavily protected concrete targets. The U-boat pen Nordsee III and subterranean bunkers on the island of Heligoland were also selected as targets for this testing. Bombs were carried by Avro Lancasters from No. 15 Squadron RAF and US Boeing B-29 Superfortress and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft operating from RAF Marham. Around 140 sorties were flown, testing a range of different bombs. Because it seemed impossible to destroy Valentin by bombing it, the decision was made to destroy it by blasting. This idea was later abandoned because the blasting would have caused severe damage to the nearby villages of Rekum and Farge including the power-station in Farge. In 1960 the bunker was taken over by the German Navy, for use as a storage depot. In 1983, a memorial to the workers who built Valentin was erected. Titled Vernichtung durch Arbeit (Extermination through labour), it was by Bremen artist Fritz Stein.Beschreibung auf der Homepage des KZ Neuengamme. High maintenance costs forced the German Defence Ministry to offer the bunker for sale in 2008. Military use finally came to an end on 31 December 2010. Its custodianship was passed to a group called Denkort Bunker Valentin with the intention of developing it as a museum and a memorial. The group currently offers guided tours of the bunker to the public.

Biography In September 1706, William Cowper secretly married the beautiful 20-year-old Mary, daughter of John Clevage, of Chopwell, Durham after his first wife died in 1705.William Cowper, History of Parliament, Retrieved 12 February 2017 Her half-sister was Ann Liddell whose letters recorded contemporary politics. In November of the same year her husband succeeded to his father's baronetcy and in December he was raised to the peerage as Baron Cowper of Wingham, Kent. In May 1707 Queen Anne in Council named William Cowper the first Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. The Queen came to have a high regard for Cowper: she valued his advice and, due to his exceptionally youthful appearance, called him \\"her schoolboy\\". When his party went out of office in 1710 the Queen pleaded with Cowper not to resign, and only accepted his resignation with \\"tears in her eyes\\". He was later appointed one of the Lords Justices responsible for governing the country until George I arrived in England after Queen Anne's death. King George reappointed him Lord Chancellor, and for a time placed great trust in him, although they later quarrelled. As Lady of the Bedchamber to Caroline, Princess of Wales, Mary immediately put her new-found access to court and her fluent French to use in acting as a go- between for her husband (who did not speak French). The first day she attended the Princess she gave her Bernstorff‚Äôs 'A Treatise on the State of Parties' which she 'had transcribed and translated for my Lord, in French and English, to give the King.' In April 1718 Earl Cowper resigned his office as Lord Chancellor, and retired to Colne Green, his home in the country, but Mary remained at Court as Lady of the Bedchamber to Caroline, Princess of Wales and in her diaries wrote an account of events at Court. Some of the diaries were destroyed by Mary but the diaries covering October 1714 to October 1716 and April 1720 to May 1720 were later published by Charles Spencer Cowper in 1864.Anne Kugler, ‚ÄòCowper , Mary, Countess Cowper (1685‚Äì1724)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 12 Feb 2017 She could write vividly and with a dry wit, as when describing the unfortunate marriage of John Hartstonge, Bishop of Derry, to Isabelle Danvers, a lady of the Royal Bedchamber. Lord Cowper died after a short illness on 10 October 1723 at his residence, Colne Green, in Hertford, built by himself in 1704 (demolished by the 5th Earl in 1801 on advice from the landscape designer Repton) nearby to which the later mansion of Panshanger was built in 1840 and also demolished in 1954. Mary died grief-stricken several months later. The 1st Earl and Mary left two sons and two daughters; their younger son, Spencer, became Dean of Durham.

Life Fortescue-Brickdale was born at her parents' house, Birchamp Villa in Upper Norwood, Surrey as Mary Eleanor Fortescue Brickdale the daughter of Matthew and Sarah Fortescue Brickdale. Her father was a barrister. She was trained first at the Crystal Palace School of Art, under Herbert Bone and entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1896. In that year she also exhibited a work at the Royal Academy, RA, and won a prize for designing a lunette, Spring for the RA Dining Room. Her first major painting was The Pale Complexion of True Love (1899). She soon began exhibiting her oil paintings at the Royal Academy, and her watercolours at the Dowdeswell Gallery, where she had several solo exhibitions. While at the academy, Fortescue-Brickdale came under the influence of John Byam Liston Shaw, a prot√©g√© of John Everett Millais much influenced by John William Waterhouse. When Byam Shaw founded his art school in 1911, Fortescue-Brickdale became a teacher there. In 1909, Ernest Brown, of the Leicester Galleries, commissioned a series of 28 watercolour illustrations to Tennyson's Idylls of the King, which Fortescue-Brickdale painted over two years. They were exhibited at the gallery in 1911, and 24 of them were published the following year in a deluxe edition of the first four Idylls. She lived during much of her career in Holland Park Road, opposite Leighton House, where she held an exhibition in 1904. Fortescue-Brickdale exhibited at the first exhibition of the Society of Graphic Art in 1921. Later, she also worked with stained glass. She was a staunch Christian, and donated works to churches. Amongst her best known works are The Uninvited Guest and Guinevere. She died on 10 March 1945,\\"Obituary. Times [London, England] 14 Mar. 1945: 7. The Times Digital Archive.

At the age of 89, was presented with a 'baggy green' Australia cap and badge in a ceremony in 2004 at the offices of Cricket Australia in Melbourne. Interviewed after the ceremony she recalled how some of her team mates slept on luggage racks as they traveled by train around the country: She died in 2006 aged 91, but her death was not reported until later as she had no close relatives.

It was substantially amended by the Employment Relations (Validation of Union Registration and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2001 and by the ERAA (No 2) 2004. Preceding statutes The original statute governing employment relations in New Zealand was the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894 (ICAA). It remained in force for 80 years from 1894 to 1973. In 1973, the Third Labour Government brought in the Industrial Relations Act 1973 (IRA). In 1987, the Fourth Labour Government brought in the Labour Relations Act 1987 (LRA). In 1991, the Fourth National Government brought in the Employment Contracts Act 1991 (ECA). It was in force from 15 May 1991 to 2 October 2000 when it was repealed by the Fifth Labour Government and replaced with the ERA 2000. The ICAA and IRA gave the most power to a government agency to force employers and employees to reach an agreement. The ECA gave the most freedom to employers and employees to reach agreement without government intervention. The LRA, the ERA 2000 and the ERAA 2004 lie in the middle of this spectrum. Courts and institutions Each Act established a court or institution to settle industrial disputes. The ICAA had the Court of Arbitration. The IRA had the Industrial Court and the Industrial Commission which was replaced in 1977 by Arbitration Court. The LRA had the Labour Court and the Arbitration Commission. The ECA had the Employment Court and the Employment Tribunal. The ERA established the Employment Court, the Employment Relations Authority, and the Mediation Service. =Employment Court= The judges of the Employment Court are appointed by the Governor- General on the advice of the Attorney-General (section 200). Section 187 of the ERA gives the Employment Court jurisdiction over all matters relating to employment disputes. The Employment Court is a court of record and has equal standing to the High Court of New Zealand. =Employment Relations Authority= The members of the Employment Relations Authority are appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Minister (section 167). Section 157 states that the Employment Relations Authority is an investigative body that examines the facts of the case, as opposed to legal technicalities, in seeking to resolve problems with the parties' employment relationship. =Mediation Service= Section 144 established the Mediation Service, which was hosted by the Department of Labour until 2012, when the department ceased to exist and the role was transferred to the Labour Group of the newly formed Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Section 164 (b) says that the parties should have tried to solve their problems before going to the Employment Relations Authority. Coverage of the ERA Almost all employees in NZ are covered by the ERA (section 6). The ERA covers persons who do any work for payment for an employer under a contract of service. Payment may include commissions, piece rates, salaries, or wages. In 2007 the Employment Relations Authority decided that some Ukrainian sailors, who entered into their employment agreements in Russia and were working on a Russian registered ship in NZ waters for a NZ-based charter were entitled to get the NZ minimum wage while in NZ waters.Your rights: Working under Aussie law, NZ Herald However, the armed forces, judges, the NZ SIS, and to some extent the police are not covered.Police officers quit after rural station woes, www.stuff.co.nz The ERA specifically includes homeworkers, for example, a person who buys material from a provider to make shirts at home and then sells the shirts back to the provider, and persons intending to work, that is, those who have accepted a job offer but not yet started working. It specifically excludes volunteers. The ERA does not cover the relationship between principal and contractor or between contractor and sub-contractor. When the nature of the employment relationship is in doubt the Employment Court \\"must consider all relevant matters\\" pertaining to the nature of the relationship. (section 6(3) a). =Employee vs independent contractor= Independent contractors are not covered by the ERA. Whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee can be difficult to determine. In Bryson v Three Foot Six Ltd (2003) & (2005),7 NZELC 97,317 & 7 NZELC 97,866 the Employment Relations Authority decided Bryson was a contractor but the Employment Court and the Supreme Court decided he was an employee. The Employment Court may consider the following factors when deciding when a person is an employer or a contractor. * The intention of the parties, that is, the terminology used in their contract. * Whether one party is able to exercise control over how the other party does the work and to what degree. * Whether the worker is free to get another person to do part of the work. * Which party provides the tools or equipment needed to do the job. Hook v JB's Contractors Ltd (2001).6 NZELC 96,207 * Whether the alleged contractor hires their own workers or not. Hook * Which party is assuming the risk of making a profit or a loss. Hook * The amount of responsibility for management and investment each party has. Hook * The way in which taxes are paid (or avoided). Employers must deduct PAYE and ACC levies from employees' wages. * The way in which workers are paid. * Whether the person is GST registered. If they are, they are likely to be a contractor. * Whether the work the worker does is fundamental to the organisation. * The way in which the relationship may be terminated. The Employment Court also recognises that relationships can change over time. In Excel Corp Ltd v Carmichael (2003),7 NZELC 97,183 the worker started as a contractor but over time became an employee, whereupon he was covered by the ERA. Duties and obligations of employers and employees Section 4 states that the parties must deal with each other in good faith. In Telecom South Ltd v Post Office Union (Inc)(1991)4 NZELC 95,352;[1992] the contract of employment was described as \\"a special relationship under which workers and employers have mutual obligations of confidence, trust and fair dealing.\\" A contract of employment is not the same as a commercial contract as it resembles a fiduciary relationship in some ways. When the ERA was introduced in 2000 the Government's policy statement stated that it is > ... based on the understanding that employment is a human relationship > involving issues of mutual trust, confidence and fair dealing, and is not > simply a contractual, economic exchange. This basis requires specific > recognition of the relationship ‚Äì something not satisfactorily achieved by > general contract law.Rudman, Richard. New Zealand Employment Law Guide > (2006), page 79. =Duties and obligations of employers= Most of the duties and obligations that fall on employers are not found in the ERA but in other statutes or in common law. To pay the worker Section 65(2) of the ERA requires the employer to set out in writing the rate payable to employees. The Minimum Wage Act 1983 sets the minimum wage. The Minimum Wage Act also applies to workers who are being trained, as an Auckland Subway sandwich branch recently discovered when it tried to pay new workers in training $5 an hour.Subway in strife for paying $5 an hour Under the Wages Protection Act 1983 most employers must pay wages in cash unless they have written consent to do otherwise. Employers may only make deductions required or permitted by statute or with the written consent of the employee. To ensure a safe workplace Under the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 the employer has a duty to ensure that the workplace is safe for employees, contractors and visitors. In Williams v Dunedin City Ford (Unreported, Employment Relations Authority, Christchurch, 19 September 2007) the Employment Relations Authority decided that a female worker who had viewed 2 pornographic images at work in three days, and complained about them to her supervisor, had not been provided with a safe and secure workplace \\"free of avoidable harm\\", due to the employer's failure to deal with the second pornographic image. The employee was eventually dismissed after being absent from work on long-term sick leave. She was awarded $10,000 for lost salary and $7500 as compensation for distress.Workplace porn: a health and safety issue? To permit employees to take paid leave The Holidays Act 2003 gives employees 11 public holidays, 4 weeks of annual leave, 5 sick days, and 3 days bereavement leave. The Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987 gives employees 14 weeks (though increasing to 16 weeks as of 1 April 2015) of government funded parental (maternity) leave (maximum $504 per week).Paid parental leave rate Employees may also take an additional 38 weeks extended leave for child care. There is a presumption that the job will be kept open for the employee taking leave. Not to discriminate against employees Three pieces of legislation cover discrimination in the workplace. The Equal Pay Act 1972 made different pay rates for men and women doing the same job illegal. The Human Rights Act 1993 made discrimination on 13 grounds illegal. They are : sex, marital status, religious belief, ethical belief, color, race, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, political opinion, employment status, family status, or sexual orientation. Section 103 of the ERA adds 3 more prohibited grounds to the 13 in the Human Rights Act. They are sexual harassment, racial harassment and discrimination due to union activities. To take responsibility for employees actions Unless employees are knowingly acting unlawfully or deliberately disobeying instructions employers have a common law duty to honour contracts or promises that employees make on their behalf. Employers also have a duty to indemnify employees for losses and reimburse them for reasonable expenses. In October 2005, an Air New Zealand flight attendant lost a $450 gold tie-pin on a flight. 18 months later, the Employment Relations Authority ordered Air NZ to pay for the tie-pin.Air NZ ordered to pay flight attendant for lost tie-pin, NZ Herald Employers are also vicariously liable for damages caused by employees in the course of their employment. To provide written employment agreements Section 65 of the ERA states that individual employment agreements must be in writing. An employment agreement must contain: * The names of the employer and employee. * A description of the work to be performed. * An indication of where the employee will work. * The working hours. * The wages or salary. * A plain- language explanation of the services available for sorting out employment relationship problems. * Notice of the 90-day time limit to raise a personal grievance. If an employer does not provide a written employment agreement, the maximum fine is $5,000 for an individual or $10,000 for a company. A good employment agreement should also have clauses covering the term of employment, protection of the employer's confidential information, leave (statutory and non-statutory), redundancy, termination of employment, serious misconduct, suspension, and where applicable, clauses covering probationary periods, targets and bonuses, and restraint of trade.Get it in writing for a good start in a work relationship, www.stuff.co.nz Covert surveillance Covert surveillance of employees by employers does not breach the principle of good faith if it is done in accordance with the law.Under Surveillance Legislation allows employers to use cameras and other methods of surveillance without the knowledge of staff if there was reasonable suspicion that a crime was being committed, if the equipment was used for the specific purpose of investigating that crime and if the equipment is removed immediately after the crime has been solved. In one case a sales rep was given a company car but wasn't achieving sales targets or satisfactorily accounting for his time so the employer covertly installed a GPS tracking device in his car to monitor his movements, and discovered that most of his days were spent at golf courses around Auckland. The employee was dismissed and he challenged his sacking by appealing to the Privacy Commissioner, claiming the company had been underhand in installing a GPS device in his car without his knowledge. The commissioner upheld the employer's right to use it since the company had reasonable grounds to suspect that the employee was behaving dishonestly.Big Brother in the office =Duties and obligations of employees= Most of the duties and obligations that fall on employees are not found in the ERA but in other statutes or in common law. To work Employees must be ready, willing and able to perform their job as specified in their employment agreements. Employees must have the required skill and necessary qualifications to perform the work. They must give personal service to their employer and not get another person to work in their place. Part 6 of the ERA allows workers to preserve their working conditions if they choose to transfer to a new employer through restructuring. If an employee doesn't show up for work for 3 or 4 consecutive days and fails to inform his or her employer, then the employer is entitled to conclude that the employee has \\"abandoned the employment\\". However, the employer should make an effort to contact the absent employee. Employment agreements often contain an abandonment clause.Your Rights: Save the hassle ‚Äì let the boss know you'll be away To obey instructions Employees must obey instructions so long as the instructions are lawful, are not dangerous, and are within the scope of their employment agreement. =Dangerous tasks= Employees cannot refuse dangerous tasks that are an inherent part of their work. e.g. nurses providing treatment to someone with an infectious disease. =Overtime= An employment agreement may contain a clause that states an employee must work overtime when requested. If this is the case then a refusal to work overtime is a breach of the employment agreement. If there is no clause regarding overtime, then the 40 hours per week is the maximum set by the Minimum Wage Act.Your Rights: Standing guard over your midnight oil reserves, NZ Herald Employment Agreements of salaried employees often contain a clause like this: > The salary/wages for this position cover all time worked in meeting the > performance requirements and the employee is not entitled to additional > payment for time worked outside the normal hours specified. However, where a > significant number of additional hours are worked, the employer will, if > possible allow the employee to take time off in compensation for the > additional hours worked. As a result, 20% of New Zealanders work more than 50 hours a week. An OECD study shows that New Zealander's now work some of the longest hours in the Western world ‚Äì 1826 hours a year, compared with the OECD average of 1778.Flexible hours bill set to pass, stuff.co.nz In response, the Flexible Working Arrangements Act was passed on 21 November 2007.New Bill brings work relief It aims to allow employees who are also caregivers to request more flexible working hours. =Serious misconduct= Employees can be sacked for serious misconduct. However, in November 2007, the Employment Authority decided that having a shouting match with the boss, which included obscenities and personal abuse, did not amount to serious misconduct, at least when the boss contributes to the dispute.Worker reinstated after row over toilet break, stuff.co.nz On the other hand, in December 2007, the Employment Relations Authority found that a sports journalist who told his editor to leave \\"his f...ing copy alone\\" was fairly dismissed. The rugby league journalist had received warnings about his behaviour before.Man who told editor leave 'f..... copy alone' fairly sacked ‚Äì ERA, NZ Herald To take care Under the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992, employees are also required to ensure a safe working environment. They must also take care not to damage the employer's property and equipment. An employee who damages their employer through deliberate misconduct or negligence may be sued by the employer for compensation. To show fidelity There are many ways in which courts have held that employees have breached this duty. Employees can not : * Work for their employer's competitors in their own time. * Use information gained at work for personal gain or disclose the employer's confidential information unless it is an act of whistle blowing. * Fail to report misconduct by other employees. * Do anything in their free time to damage the reputation of their employer. Many employees have been fired for committing crimes that were unrelated to their job. * Try to take away an employer's customers for when they go into business for themselves. Employers may also try to prevent employees competing with them after the employee has left the company by including restraint of trade provisions in the employment agreement. However these provisions are only enforceable if a court decides they are reasonable in terms of the parties' interests and the public interest.Your Rights: Protecting the business against ex-employees In an unreported case in September 2007, the Employment Relations Authority decided that a clause that prevented a hair stylist from soliciting or dealing with any customers from his old workplace for 3 months after he had left his old workplace, was reasonable. The stylist's new workplace was 50 meters from the old one.Employee restraints: this time it‚Äôs WAR Drug testing Employers can unilaterally introduce drug testing in the workplace if it is \\"reasonable\\" and the employer should consult with employees before introducing the policy. Two useful cases on drug testing in the NZ workplace are NZ Amalgamated Engineering and Manufacturing Union v Air New Zealand Ltd and MUNZ and Ors v TLNZ and Anor. In NZAE&MU; v AirNZ the Employment Court said that employees engaged in \\"safety-sensitive\\" areas, such as flying planes, could be drug tested. In MUNZ and Ors v TLNZ and Anor the Employment Court said the drug testing policy must be \\"reasonable in all the circumstances\\".Your Rights: Workplace drug tests legal =Breach of duties and obligations= A serious breach of any one of the duties by the employee allows the employer to fire the employee. A breach of these duties by the employer that causes the employee to resign allows the employee to sue for constructive dismissal. Termination of employment Employees can only be fired if the employer has a good reason and has followed a fair procedure. Good reasons for firing employees include : * Unsatisfactory performance * Incompatibility with other employees * Absenteeism * Negligence * Misrepresentation in a curriculum vitae (exaggeration in a CV may not be sufficient)Your Rights: Deciphering fact from fiction in a curriculum vitae, NZ Herald * Incompetence (where a person says they have a skill but in fact don't)Your Rights: Dismissal needs valid reason, NZ Herald * Misconduct * Inability to perform the work due to injury or illness * Theft (of even low value items e.g. six jars of jam) Justifying dismissal a serious matter, NZ Herald * Sleeping on the job If you snooze, you lose ‚Äì your job that is, Stuff.co.nz * Violence (even against a co-worker's car Matt McCarten: Rearranging the deck chairs may be enough for the voters, NZ Herald or a cow Farm worker fairly dismissed for beating cow, authority finds, NZ Herald) In all of these situations the seriousness of the \\"bad behaviour\\" is crucial. The termination must also be procedurally fair. A procedure that does not follow the principles of natural justice is unlikely to be held to be fair. The leading case on procedural fairness is NZ Food Processing, IUOW v Unilever.1 NZILR 35;[1990] A dismissal following poor or unfair procedure will not necessary result in the Court finding that the dismissal was unjustified if the conduct was bad enough, but may result in the employee being awarded monetary compensation. Section 103A of the ERA states that the dismissal must be \\"fair and reasonable\\" under the circumstances. In 2006 a woman was sacked for forwarding an email containing pictures of naked people but the ERA awarded her $9000 for unjustified dismissal.Payout for woman sacked over personal emails, NZ Herald (See 7.1 Unjustifiable Dismissal below for further discussion) =Summary dismissal= A summary dismissal is an immediate dismissal for serious disobedience or serious misconduct. Violence, drunkenness, disobeying reasonable orders, and insubordination on the part of the employee may be grounds for summary dismissal if the conduct is bad enough. In 2005 Donna Maree Tauhore assaulted a colleague and was dismissed and prosecuted for assault. She was acquitted of assault in the District Court but the Employment Relations Authority rejected her claim of unjustified dismissal saying that based on the information available at the time, the employer's decision to sack her was reasonable.:. Woman loses unfair dismissal claim after beating up co-worker, NZ Herald =Constructive dismissal= A constructive dismissal results when an employee resigns due to unfair pressure from the employer. In IUOW v Woolworths:2 NZLR 372;[1985] three categories of constructive dismissal were set. * The employee is given a choice between being fired and resigning. * The employer deliberately breached a duty in order to force the employee to resign. * The employer breached a duty (not deliberately) which led the employee to resign. The employee's resignation also needs to be caused by the breach of duty on the part of the employer and the breach has to be serious enough to make it reasonably foreseeable that there was a substantial risk of resignation.Your Rights: Resigned over religious conviction,NZ Herald Claims of constructive dismissal are not simple and are relatively difficult to prove in court. Many claims of constructive dismissal arise when an employer changes the working conditions to the employee's disadvantage, e.g. more responsibility but no more pay. The employee quits and then tries to claim constructive dismissal. However, under section 103(1)b of the ERA, the employee is only entitled to pursue a personal grievance claim when \\"1 or more conditions ... are ... affected to the employee's disadvantage by some unjustified action by the employer\\". In a case from April 2006, the Employment Relations Authority awarded a woman $6000 for constructive dismissal when she felt she had no choice but to resign because she could no longer trust her company's managing director, who broke a promise not to disclose her name to a \\"very unstable\\" colleague that she had reported for making threats, and because she felt unsafe at the company.Woman caught up in office row awarded $6000, NZ Herald =Redundancy= Sections 69M and 69N of the ERA states that every employment agreement must contain an \\"employee protection provision\\" which protects employees in the case of \\"technical redundancy\\", that is a redundancy due to the employer selling, transferring or contracting out, all or part of its business. However, workers are usually only entitled to redundancy compensation if it is specified in their employment agreement.Your Rights: Where do I stand if the winds of change blow?, NZ HeraldYour Rights: New employers can make people redundant, NZ Herald Section 69A of the ERA gives some protection from redundancy in some situations to employees listed in Schedule 1 of the ERA, that is, cleaners, caterers, orderlies and caretakers. When an \\"employee is, or will be, no longer required by his or her employer to perform the work, or part of the work, performed by the employee\\" (section 69C) an employee may be made redundant. Not only does an employer need genuine business reasons for a redundancy, they must follow a fair procedure. Based on case law, fair procedure includes: * notification of the restructuring process before decisions are made. * notification of the criteria used to decide who will be made redundant. * a discussion with employees of how the restructuring process could affect their positions. * an opportunity for employees to comment on the restructuring process. * offering alternative positions within the company. * a reasonable period before the redundancy takes effect. If a redundancy was not fair an employee may bring a personal grievance for unjustified dismissal.:Made redundant without warning, NZ Herald \\"Sham\\" redundancy As there is no automatic entitlement to redundancy pay in NZ, some employers see redundancy as a way of getting rid of an employee they may not like but whose job performance is not poor enough to justify a dismissal. While employers are allowed to restructure their business to make it more efficient, they may not simply change the job title, offer a lower salary or wage, but leave the job description \\"substantially similar\\". This would be a \\"sham\\" redundancy. The test for \\"substantially similar\\" is: > Would a reasonable person, taking into account the nature, terms and > conditions of the new position consider there was sufficient difference > between the former role and the alternative role offered by the employer? Some factors that are compared to determine whether a new role is \\"substantially similar\\" to an old one are: * Level of responsibilities. * Change in seniority ‚Äì is this a demotion? * Changes to salary and other benefits. * Reduced or increased hours of work. * Different type of employment, e.g. fixed term instead of permanent. * Reduced leave entitlements or other benefits. * Reduced/removed redundancy compensation. * Recognition of prior service.Your rights: When redundancy is not genuine New role Employers may make a position redundant but offer the employee another role in the company. If the new role is \\"substantially similar\\" then the employee is obliged to accept the new role.Your Rights: Where do I stand if the winds of change blow?, NZ Herald =Employer bankruptcy= When an employer goes into bankruptcy the order in which creditors are paid is determined by schedule 7 of the Companies Act 1993 and section 104 of the Insolvency Act 1967. The fees and expenses of the Assignee or Liquidator are paid first. The costs and expenses incurred by the creditor who asked the court to declare the bankruptcy are paid second. Wages, salaries, holiday pay, redundancy, and payments ordered by the Employment Relations Authority or Employment Court, owed to employees are paid third. An employee can only receive a maximum of $15,000. However, when the employee is married to the bankrupt then he or she is paid sixth. Money owed to the IRD for child support, the kiwisaver scheme and the student loan scheme, is also paid third. ‚Ä†NB the Act itself says \\"fourth\\" and \\"seventh\\" respectively, but what ever was \\"third\\" has been repealed. Personal grievance According to section 103 of the ERA, an employee that believes he or she has been; # unjustifiably dismissed; # disadvantaged in employment by an unjustified action by the employer; # discriminated against; # sexually harassed; # racially harassed;or # subject to duress over union membership; may pursue a personal grievance. In addition whistle blowers are protected under the Protected Disclosures Act 2000. Section 112 of the ERA states that when an employee can choose to bring an action under the ERA or the Human Rights Act 1993 the employee can not bring an action under both acts. Section 114 of the ERA states that a personal grievance must be raised with the employer within 90 days. =1 Unjustifiable dismissal= The Personal Grievance provisions of the ERA are now the only way for an employee to challenge a dismissal (section 113). Employees no longer have the right to sue under the common law in the Courts. There was no definition of \\"unjustifiably dismissed\\" in the original ERA but in 2004, section 103A(2): \\"Test of Justification\\" which applies to claims for unjustifiable dismissal or unjustifiable disadvantage, was added to the Act: > The question of whether a dismissal or an action was justifiable must be > determined, on an objective basis, by considering whether the employer's > actions, and how the employer acted, were what a fair and reasonable > employer would have done in all the circumstances at the time the dismissal > or action occurred. Section 103A(2) was amended in 2011, with the word 'would' replaced with 'could'. This results in a much more objective approach as to what is fair and reasonable by the employer. The employer must show that a dismissal was justified substantially and procedurally. Procedural fairness The leading case on procedural fairness is IUOW v Unilever NZ. It says that the employee must be given; *notice of the specific allegation and its gravity and possible outcome *an opportunity to refute the allegation (with an opportunity to have a representative, not simply a witness, present) *unbiased consideration of the employee's explanation. These are the minimum standards but a more comprehensive procedure may be required depending on the facts of the case. In Trotter v Telecom NZ:2 ERNZ 351;[1993] the court said that in the case of dismissal for poor work performance: > Warnings for poor work performance should be explicit and fair. They should > describe how an employee's behaviour is deemed to be unsatisfactory, give > clear information about what improvements will meet the employer's > requirements, and how improvement will be measured. However judges have recognised that most employers will not be able to provide perfectly fair procedures for dismissing employees. In BP Oil v NDU:[1992] 3 ERNZ 483 (CA) the Court of Appeal said: > The question is essentially what it was open to a reasonable and fair > employer to do in the circumstances. In IUOW v Unilever NZ the court also said: > ...the employer's conduct of the disciplinary processes is not to be put > under a microscope and subjected to pedantic scrutiny. This means that minor procedural inadequacies should not render a disciplinary action unjustified. For a detailed example see Pixie Eruera Morrison v New Zealand PostUnreported, Employment Court, Auckland, 31 July 2007 (discussed in Investigating misconduct : a delicate tea ceremony? see external links). In this case the Employment Court found that NZ Post's investigation was not up to standard but the employee's misconduct was serious enough to justify the employee's dismissal. However Tony Skelton, managing director and CEO of ACE Training, believes that small to medium-sized employers find it so difficult to comply with the requirements of the ERA 2000 that they pay one to three months salary to underperforming employees to leave rather than dismiss them through the process outlined under the Act.Hard to get bad eggs poached > If we as business owners don't follow the process correctly, irrespective of > the reasons and the legitimacy of a disciplinary action, we are in default > of the Act and we are going to get done for it. From a small businesses > owner's point of view, the business has absolutely no protection whatsoever. > It's a completely lopsided, unbalanced piece of legislation. It takes three > months to go through the process and, if you slip up on one point, the > Employment Court says you've stuffed up. =All the circumstances= \\"...all the circumstances\\" in section 103A could include the size and resources of the organisation. A large organisation with a human resources department could do a better investigation than a small business. A large organisation could also afford to suspend an employee on full pay while the investigation is carried out. The NZ Police suspended Clint Rickards on full pay from February 2004 until November 2007, when Rickards resigned.Clint Rickards resigns from police, NZ Herald A small business could not afford to suspend an employee for several years on full pay. =Procedurally fair process= An example of a procedurally fair process is as follows: 1 The employer conducts a proper investigation into the alleged wrongdoing. 2 The employer invites the employee to a disciplinary meeting. The employee should be told: * All the information that was uncovered in the investigation. * To bring any information of their own. * That he or she can bring a representative or a support person. * That the outcome of the disciplinary process may be dismissal. 3 At the meeting, the employer should properly explain their information and give the employee a chance to respond to it and present their own information. 4 After the meeting, the employer should properly consider all the information with an open mind and inform the worker of the decision.Your Rights: No work permit grounds for firing, NZherald.co.nz =Probation or trial periods= An employer and employee may agree on a probation or trial period but this must be specified in writing in the employment agreement. However the employer can not simply dismiss the employee at the end of the trial period if the employee has not met expectations. An employee on \\"probation\\" has all the protection under the ERA that ordinary employees have, that is, an employer needs a good reason and must follow a fair procedure to dismiss a worker (section 67). In response to an employer who wants to sack an underperforming worker on a probationary period, lawyer Lyndal Yaqub of DLA Phillips Fox gives the following advice:Your Rights: Why you can't fire after a probationary period > Under The Employment Relations Act probationary periods do not affect the > application of the law relating to unjustifiable dismissal. Even if an > employee agrees to enter into an employment agreement that is subject to a > probationary period or trial period, the employer must ensure that any > dismissal is carried out in a procedurally fair manner and is substantively > justified. ...In other words you cannot just let the probationary period > expire and then give the employee notice. You will leave yourself vulnerable > to a personal grievance action based on unjustifiable dismissal if you do > not follow a fair process. ...you should ... set up a meeting with the > employee and at this meeting tell him precisely where he is under performing > and exactly what he needs to do to improve. Allow him to comment on this and > encourage him to put forward any concerns he may have about e.g. his role, > the way he is being supervised etc. If any further training is required then > identify this with the employee at this meeting. At the same time you should > make it clear to the employee that his employment is in jeopardy if he does > not improve. This way the employee will become aware that he needs to > improve and focus rather than being blissfully unaware that he is under > performing. ... You should also extend the probationary period to give the > employee an opportunity to improve. If after the extended probationary > period the employee has still not improved you have the option of dismissing > him. Steve Punter, managing director of Staff Training Associates, gives the following advice to new employees:First 90 days key to your new job > What the new employee needs to know is that, if there is a probationary > period, then it must be written in the contract of employment ‚Äì it cannot be > done verbally. Also in the agreement ‚Äì or in some other document linked to > it ‚Äì has to be what the employer will do if the new person doesn't work out > in the new job... the whole process has to be transparent, upfront and > documented so the employee knows exactly where they stand.

Usually, employees who are still working for their employer file a personal grievance for disadvantage. Employees who have been fired or who have quit, would file a personal grievance for unjustified dismissal or constructive dismissal, respectively. Conditions of Employment that are covered by a collective agreement or an individual employment agreement cannot be unilaterally varied in a substantial way by an employer unless there is a clause in the agreement to this effect. Minor variations that do not make the role \\"substantially different\\" are permissible.Your Rights: Job change needs consent Therefore, claims of unjustified disadvantage usually arise from conditions of employment that are outside a collective agreement or a contract of employment. Examples are: * a demotion. * withdrawal of an offer of promotion. Jarvie v Zebrax * being given new tasks with a lower rate of pay. Anderson v Advanced Foods NZ * a broken promise of casual work after a redundancy. Blance v DB Breweries * withdrawal of a staff discount. * instructions to work on an unsafe machine. * a final warning. Alliance Freezing v NZAE etc. Section 103A, the \\"Test of Justification\\" also applies to disadvantage, so the employer must show that their action was justified substantially and procedurally. =3 Discrimination= Section 104 states that direct or indirect discrimination against employees on the 13 grounds set out in section 21(1) of the Human Rights Act 1993 is unlawful. Section 105 lists these grounds, namely: # Sex # Marital status # Religious belief # Ethical belief # Colour # Race # Ethnic or national origin # Disability # Age # Political opinion # Employment status # Family status # Sexual orientation Section 104 also adds 2 more prohibited grounds for discrimination to this list and they are: # An employee's refusal to do work under section 28A of the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 # An employee's involvement in the activities of a union. Section 106 states that the \\"exceptions in relation to discrimination\\" in the Human Rights Act 1993 also apply to employment. For example, a church is entitled to discriminate against members of a different religion when advertising for a minister. =4 Sexual harassment= Section 108 prohibits direct or indirect sexual harassment by an employer where the harassment has a detrimental effect on the employee's employment, job performance, or job satisfaction. Section 117 prohibits sexual harassment by co-workers or customers. =5 Racial harassment= Section 109 prohibits racial harassment by an employer where the harassment has a detrimental effect on the employee's employment, job performance, or job satisfaction. Section 117 prohibits racial harassment by co-workers or customers. =6 Duress over union involvement= Section 110 prohibits employers from discriminating against employees for their involvement (or non-involvement) in a union or other employee organisation. =Remedies= The primary remedy when the employee has a personal grievance is reinstatement. (section 125) Other remedies include: *Reimbursement of lost wages or money. *Payment for humiliation, loss of dignity, injury to feelings. *Compensation for any other loss. (section 123 b) The Employment Relations Authority may also order interim reinstatement pending the hearing of the personal grievance (section 127). If the employee has contributed to the situation that gave rise to the personal grievance then the remedies may be reduced (section 124). The amount of compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, injury to feelings, etc. is at the discretion of the Authority and the Court and while there is no set maximum, there are indications that $27,000 is the upper limit. However, most amounts are well below this.Employment Problems: it's the putting right that counts. Stuff.co.nz Under the old ACC scheme, which was abolished in 1992, the maximum payout for personal injury was also $27,000. =Cost of pursuing a personal grievance= Employees who are union members can ask the union to help them and legal costs will be low. However, cheap lawyers charge at least $150 per hour and large city firms $300‚Äì$450 per hour.Getting a beef on work menu It costs at least $200 to get a lawyer to file a notice of grievance, unless a free community lawyer acts on your behalf. Community lawyers can be found by ringing the local citizens advice beurau. A day-long mediation at the Department of Labor costs about $300 in legal fees which is only necessary if the case goes beyond one day before the ERA mediator / court. To file a case with the Employment Relations Authority it costs about $71.56 in legal fees and this includes the first day of court costs. The average payout is between $2000 and $4000 and the successful party usually has their legal fees reimbursed by the losing party.When winning the leaky home battle costs too much, NZ Herald Not surprisingly, 95% of cases do not go past mediation. Collective bargaining The ERA acknowledges that there is an \\"inherent inequality of power in employment relationships\\" and promotes collective bargaining (Section 3) as a way of evening up the power disparity between employers and employees. It also \\"recognise(s) the role of unions in promoting their members' collective employment interests\\". (section 12) =Good faith= The requirement for parties to deal with each other in good faith is central to the ERA. A detailed explanation of good faith was added to the ERA in 2004 (Section 4). In addition sections 35‚Äì37 allow the Minister of Labour to approve codes of good faithcode of good faith, Department of Labour \\"to provide guidance about the application of the duty of good faith in ... relation to collective bargaining\\". All parties, that is employers, employees and unions in an employment relationship must act in good faith (section 4,2). Section 32 outlines the minimum things that unions and employers must do when bargaining for a collective agreement. They are: * Agree on a bargaining process. (The Code of Good Faith lists 19 matters for consideration in Section 2.2 a-s) * Meet each other. * Consider and respond to proposals made by each other. * Recognise the authority of the representative and not try to bargain with the persons the representatives are acting for. * Provide the other party with (economic) information to support bargaining claims. Section 33 states that the duty of good faith requires the parties to conclude a collective agreement unless there is a genuine reason, based on reasonable grounds, not to. The following are classic examples of not bargaining in good faith. *Surface bargaining is merely going through the motions or bargaining without any real intention of reaching agreement. *Dilatory tactics is where one party refuses to meet and negotiate at reasonable times and intervals. *Imposing conditions ‚Äì attempting to impose unreasonable or onerous conditions on the other party indicate bad faith. *Unilateral changes in conditions by an employer is a strong indication that the employer is not interested in negotiating. *Bypassing the representative ‚Äì an employer that tries to bypass the union and bargain directly with workers or refuses to negotiate with the union is not acting in good faith. *Not providing information ‚Äì an employer must, upon request, provide information to a union to enable it to understand and intelligently discuss the issues raised in bargaining.Dessler, Gary. Human Resource Management (1997) page 567. The penalty for a breach of good faith is $5000 for an individual and $10,000 for a company (section 135). In November 2007 the Employment Relations Authority found that Air NZ had breached its good faith obligations to the Service and Food Workers' Union (SFWU) by sending letters to 269 employees it believed to be members of the SFWU, trying to entice them to leave the union. Air NZ may be fined up to $2.69 million (decision pending).Air NZ could face $2.7 million fine over dispute, NZ Herald =Collective bargaining process= Sections 40 to 50 cover the collective bargaining process. =Collective agreements= The aim of collective bargaining is to make a collective agreement. Strikes and lock- outs =Strikes= Section 81 defines a strike very broadly. Almost any act that deviates from normal working practices or breaks an employment agreement is included. Go-slows, black bans on persons or products, work-to-rules, reducing normal output and refusing to do overtime are all strike actions. Media statements by Air NZ pilots in 1991, that Air NZ planes may be not be airworthy were held to be a strike, even though the pilots were working as normal, that is, flying planes they had said may not be \\"airwothy\\".NZ Air Line Pilots Assn IUOW v Air NZ, 1992, 1 ERNZ 353 Workers may strike only in relation to bargaining for a new collective agreement (section 86) or \\"on grounds of health and safety\\"(section 84). Workers must wait for the old collective agreement to expire before they go on strike. As collective bargaining can only be undertaken by a union, only union members can go on strike. One person cannot go on strike, only a \\"number of employees\\" can do so (section 81). Sympathy strikes, Strikes for political purposes, such as human rights in other countries, and General Strikes are all unlawful. =Lockouts= Section 82 defines lock-outs. A lock-out occurs when an employer suspends or discontinues the normal operation of their business, completely or partially, with the intent to compel employees to accept terms of employment or comply with demands made by the employer. As with strikes, employers may only lock-out workers in relation to bargaining for a new collective agreement (section 86) or \\"on grounds of health and safety\\"(section 84). In contrast with a strike, one worker may be locked out. = Wages during industrial action = Employers do not have to pay wages to workers taking industrial action, including statutory holiday pay (\\"other emoluments\\") (section 87). Employers may also suspend non-striking workers if there is not enough work for them and does not have to pay those workers. (section 88) Employers do not have to pay wages during lock-outs (section 96). =Essential industries= Strikes and lock-outs in \\"essential industries\\" are possible but are subject to stricter notice requirements. Notice must be given at least 3 days in advance for some industries, (Schedule B ‚Äì to avoid cruelty to animals) and 14 days in advance for others (Schedule A ‚Äì to avoid inconvenience to humans). =Strikebreakers= In general employers can not use strikebreakers (sometimes referred to by the pejorative term \\"scab\\"). They can however ask other non-striking employees to do the work that the strikers normally do. If there are health and safety issues, then the employer may employ someone especially to do the work of those on strike but the new worker can only perform duties to alleviate the health and safety issues. (section 97) =Industrial torts= A common example of an industrial tort (or economic tort) is : Workers go on an illegal strike and the company suffers economic damage due to lost production. The company then sues the workers or their union, or both, for compensation. The Employment Court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear claims based on tort law related to strikes, lock-outs, and picketing (section 99&100). Unions Section 15 states that The Registrar of Unions, who is an employee of the Department of Labour, must register a society as a union if they apply and meets the citeria set out in section 14. A union can only be deregistered if the union asks for it or the Employment Relations Authority determines that the union no longer meets the criteria in section 14. =Union access and meetings= Access : Section 20 gives union representatives the right to enter a workplace for purposes related to the employment of its members or to the union's business. Purposes related to the employment of its members include: *(a) participating in collective bargaining. *(b) dealing with health and safety issues. *(c) monitoring compliance with collective agreements. *(d) monitoring compliance with other employment related legislation. *(e) to deal with an individual's terms and conditions of employment (actual or proposed). *(f) to seek compliance where non-compliance is detected. Purposes related to the union's business include: *(a) to discuss union business with union members. *(b) to seek to recruit employees as union members. *(c) to provide information about the union to any employee. Meetings : An employer must also allow union members they employ to attend 2 paid union meetings of 2 hours duration every year. The union must give 14 days notice (section 26). =Freeloading= A free loader is someone who does not pay any dues or fees to a union yet receives the same benefits that people who have paid fees do. A common example of free loading is where a union negotiates a collective agreement for its members at a workplace and the employer then gives the same conditions to non- members. Historically, labour governments in NZ have solved this problem by legislating for compulsory unionism. National governments in turn legislated for voluntary unionism. To deal with the freeloading problem, Section 59 of the ERA makes it a breach of good faith for employers to \\"pass on\\" terms and conditions that unions have negotiated for their members to non-members if the purpose of doing so is to undermine collective bargaining or collective agreements. Under section 69, if the union, the employer, and the non-member employees at a work place all agree, then the employer may \\"pass on\\" terms and conditions to non-member employees in exchange for those employees paying a bargaining fee to the union that negotiated the agreement. The non-member employees must agree by secret ballot. 2008 Employment Relations Amendment Act The Employment Relations Amendment Act was passed under urgency by the new National Government. It allowed small businesses (those employing fewer than 20 staff) to sack employees within 90 days of being hired without those employees being able to take a personal grievance case against the employer. Kate Wilkinson, the Minister of Labour, said that the Act allowed businesses to employ new staff without a concern that they would face time consuming and costly grievance procedures if the person was not right for the job. The Labour Party said that the Act opened up workers to abuse and reduced their rights.

Lucas was a rising young Conservative politician who abandoned his wife and career for Agnes. They met when she was sent to Italy to nurse him through a bout of malaria contracted in Rome. She had been married unhappily, and after her husband died became a prominent radical lecturer, and then a nurse to earn a living. Lucas was also unhappy in his marriage and they fell in love. Now they (or at least she) envision a future of writing passionate essays against marriage, lecturing and campaigning. His relatives do not accept his decision. His uncle the Duke comes to Venice to \\"arrange\\" matters. He suggests a sham reconciliation between Lucas and his wife, and for Agnes, \\"The suburban villa, the little garden, a couple of discreet servants‚Äîeverything √† la mode.\\" Agnes sneers at this, of course, but is horrified to discover that Lucas actually considers it. She reluctantly agrees. Gertrude, though shocked by Agnes' open \\"immorality\\", has come to appreciate her philosophy. She now urges Agnes to reject this hypocritical arrangement, and instead to come with her and Amos to their home in Yorkshire. Amos also appeals to her, urging her to pray for guidance. Agnes agrees to go with them. Lucas now rejects the Duke's proposal, and the Duke asks Gertrude and Amos to stop interfering. Sybil Lucas now appears. She confronts Agnes, and‚Äîbizarrely‚Äîasks her to return to Lucas and get him to return to London. She despises Lucas, but she loved him once, and doesn't want to see him \\"utterly wasted\\". Also (though this is unspoken) an apparent reconciliation would relieve her of a great humiliation. This even though he made her as miserable as Agnes' husband did her. Agnes breaks down and agrees. But then Gertrude intervenes: this path will corrupt and destroy Agnes. Sybil now breaks down and repudiates the deal. Lucas makes a last effort to join with Agnes, and resume their \\"free love\\" life, but Agnes has had enough; she thought she was a leader, a moral example, who would show the world \\"how men and woman may live independent and noble lives without rule, guidance or sacrament\\", but she proved weak and corruptible. And she feels that she cannot sit in judgment of Sybil any longer; she will go with Amos and Gertrude, and she urges Lucas to learn to pray.

Founded in 1920 in Harrow, Middlesex, from 1921 the company moved to Stroud, Gloucestershire. After motorcycle production finished the company continued in general engineering and plastics. H.P. Baughan Henry P. \\"Harry\\" Baughan was a well-known motorcycle trialist and organiser of such in the 1920s, many of which were close to his childhood home of Stroud, Gloucestershire; although he himself at the time lived in Harrow, Middlesex whilst working as an aircraft engineer. From these sporting beginnings - at a time when making and experimenting with motorcycles was considered a normal, almost home-based art - Baughan began to make his own machines. Production In the 1920s, he had made his own first four-wheel cyclecar, powered by an air-cooled JAP V twin. Asked by fellow competitors to make them a similar machine, he productionised it through use of a JAP of water-cooled Blackburne V-twin, of either 998 or 1097 cc. Drive was to the rear wheels through a Sturmey-Archer three-speed-and-reverse gearbox and chain final drive. The chassis had a wheelbase of with suspension by quarter elliptic leaf springs all round. Lightweight two-seat open bodies were fitted. Car production finished in 1925, but new cars were still listed for sale up to 1929. It is not known how many cars were made, but at least one survives. After his own success in motorcycle trials in the early 1930s, Baughan began to make a range of trial-optimised motorcycles until 1936. Although a production template existed, each machine was a bespoke per-customer fitment. Powered again using either Blackburne or mainly JAP V-twins, ranging in size from 250 to 500 cc, each used qd real-wheel. Production is believed to have been small. As World War II approached, and with his own sporting success ad that of his machines fading, Baughan focused his skills on the production of aircraft parts. Post-World War II Baughan Ltd continued to exist into the new millennium as a producer of plastics processing equipment. They manufactured a large range of equipment including single screw extruders and 2-roll mills, with much still in use today. The company was eventually acquired by the now defunct Rondol Technology Ltd, a Staffordshire-based manufacturer of polymer processing equipment.

He used his great wealth in politics. He was an early promoter of Woodrow Wilson, but they became bitter enemies. Harvey was a conservative who wanted Washington to protect big business and harass labor unions. He repudiated Wilson when he saw Wilson oppose political machines and threaten big business in the style of progressive era reformers. Harvey then supported conservative Republican causes, such as opposition to the League of Nations.Salme Harju Steinberg, \\"Harvey, George Brinton McClellan\\" in American National Biography Online (2000) Biography Born in Peacham, Vermont, he was educated at Peacham Academy. At the age of 18, he became a reporter on the Springfield (Massachusetts) Republican and later on the New York World, where he reported on New Jersey politics. He was appointed by Governor Robert Stockton Green of New Jersey as aide-de-camp on his staff, and was reappointed by Governor Leon Abbett. The latter also made him insurance commissioner of New Jersey in 1890. A prot√©g√© of publisher Joseph Pulitzer, at the age of twenty-seven he became managing editor of the New York World (1891-4). It was the flagship newspaper of the Democratic Party; its editorials were widely reprinted by the party press.Steinberg, \\"Harvey, George Brinton McClellan\\" Harvey then became associated with Thomas F. Ryan and William C. Whitney leading Democrats who were millionaire promoters of street railways. In 1898 Harvey organized a syndicate which acquired the lines in Havana, Cuba. Having accumulated a great fortune, he purchased prestige magazines, the North American Review in 1899. It had long been the leading national magazine in arts, letters, and politics, but it was soon overshadowed and outsold by the muckraking magazines Harvey disapproved of.Frank Luther Mott, A History of American Magazines vol. 2 (1957) In 1901 he also purchased Harper's Weekly, which he edited until 1913. He was president of Harper and Company until 1915. In 1903, Harvey purchased the Metropolitan Magazine. =Politics= A conservative Democrat, Harvey was a top advisor to New Jersey governor Woodrow Wilson. As early as 1906 he became the first leader to suggest Wilson, then president of Princeton University, would be a strong presidential possibility. Arthur Link says, \\"More than any other single individual, he was responsible for Wilson's political career.\\"Arthur S. Link, Wilson: vol.1. The Road to the White House (1947) p 359 In the runup to the start of the 1912 campaign he gave Wilson strong support. But Wilson was moving left and needed to shake off the image that he was under the thumb of Wall Street. Wilson sensed he was jeopardized by Harvey's officiousness and conservatism, while Harvey was alarmed by Wilson's move to the left of the party. Their breakup was the talk of the hour in the national press, and helped Wilson gain support among liberal Democrats.Link, Wilson: vol.1. The Road to the White House (1947) pp 359-78 In 1916 Harvey urged the election of Charles E. Hughes, the Republican candidate for president. Despite retiring from Harper's Weekly as editor in 1913, he returned in 1918 to use it as a medium for attacking the policies of President Wilson.The Columbia Encyclopedia (6th ed 2005) In 1918, he established The North American Review's War Weekly, later called Harvey's Weekly, which bitterly denounced Wilson's foreign policy. Harvey was a central figure in the \\"smoke-filled room\\" that played a major role in the GOP national convention in Chicago in 1920. The politicians there recognized that the three leading contenders were stalemated and that a dark horse like Warren G. Harding was needed as the Republican nominee. Harvey himself favored Will H. Hays, another dark horse but one with less support.Wesley M. Bagby, \\"The 'Smoke Filled Room' and the Nomination of Warren G. Harding,\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review (1955) 41#4 pp. 657-674 in JSTOR Harding was elected and he appointed Harvey to the highly prestigious post of Ambassador to the Court of St. James's (perhaps better known as Ambassador to Great Britain). He served from 1921 until 1923, but was not comfortable in the role. He gained a reputation for being acid-tongued and was quoted in 1923 as saying that \\"the national American foreign policy is to have no foreign policy.\\"Thomas A. Bailey, A Diplomatic History of the American People (10th ed 1980) p. 1 From 1906 until 1908, he promoted the artificial language Esperanto in the North American Review. In 1908 and 1909 he was president of Esperanto-Asocio de Norda Ameriko (Esperanto Association of North America).Enciklopedio de Esperanto, 1934. (available on the web) He was strongly opposed to the League of Nations in 1919 and 1920 on the ground that it involved the yielding of national sovereignty. Harvey published a number of works during his life, most notably Women in 1908 and Henry Clay Frick, the Man (1928), a biography of the industrialist, art collector, and philanthropist. He died on August 20, 1928, at his home in Dublin, New Hampshire.(21 August 1928) Col.

The term was first used in the management of HIV, the first virus in which genome sequencing was routinely used to look for drug resistance. At the time of infection, a virus will infect and begin to replicate within a preliminary cell. As subsequent cells are infected, random mutations will occur in the viral genome. When these mutations begin to accumulate, antiviral methods will kill the wild type strain, but will not be able to kill one or many mutated forms of the original virus. At this point a resistance mutation has occurred because the new strain of virus is now resistant to the antiviral treatment that would have killed the original virus. Resistance mutations are evident and widely studied in HIV due to its high rate of mutation and prevalence in the general population. Resistance mutation is now studied in bacteriology and parasitology. Mechanisms Resistance mutations can occur through several mechanisms from single nucleotide substitutions to combinations of amino acid substitutions, deletions and insertions. Over time, these new genetic lines will persist if they become resistant to treatments being used against them. It has been shown that pathogens will favor and become more resistant to treatment in common host genotypes through frequency- dependent selection. Further, strict adherence to a retroviral regimen correlates to a strong decrease in retroviral resistance mutations. There are five classes of drug that are used to treat HIV infection, and resistance mutations can effect the efficacy of these treatments as well. *Entry inhibitors block the ability of HIV to enter its target cells. HIV must bind to a CD4 receptor on a T cell or the CCR5/CXCR4 co-receptors to enter the cell. They can also block the fusion of the viral and cell membranes. Entry inhibitors modify protein residues on the membrane of the T cell to make it incompatible with the HIV, thus blocking insertion of the viral genome. *Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) are phosphorylated by cellular enzymes rendering it an active NRTI triphosphate stage. When the NRTIs are activated, they being to complete with cellular nucleosides that would be incorporated during reverse transcription by HIV. When the NRTIs are incorporated into the strand being transcribed, it causes the reverse transcription to be stopped. This inhibits HIV from incorporating its genome into the host cell. *Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) inhibit reverse transcriptase by binding to an allosteric site on it. Cessation of a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor regimen poses a significant danger of selection for a drug-resistant form of HIV-1. A K103N mutation in HIV-1 causes the hydrophobic pocket in which the NNRTI binds to inhibit enzyme activity in reverse transcriptase to close by means of a hydrogen bond. Without access to the allosteric site, the NNRTI will not be effective. *Integrase inhibitors prevent the HIV integrase enzyme from incorporating its viral genome into the host chromosome. The enzyme contains a highly conserved region called the catalytic core, which is essential for binding to the virally encoded DNA. Integrase inhibitors block the ability of the catalytic core to form covalent bonds with the phosphodiester backbone of DNA. As a result, the viral DNA cannot be incorporated into the host genome. *Protease Inhibitors cause the immature formation of two essential precursor proteins known as Gag and Gagpol in HIV. These proteins are essential in maintaining viral structure and for enzyme creation. Protease inhibitors bind to the active site of the viral protease, which prevents the cleavage of the Gag and Gagpol proteins. As a result, non-infections viral particles are formed. In Other Viruses  Resistance mutations are found and become problematic in many viruses other than HIV. Notable examples of such viruses include the herpes simplex virus and hepatitis B virus. In the herpes virus, drugs mainly target the viral DNA polymerase. As a result, mutations in the viral DNA polymerase that make it resistant to these drugs are selected for, which ultimately can cause complete resistance of the treatment. In hepatitis B, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs are used to cause early termination of viral transcription. Mutations in viral reverse transcriptase can cause the enzyme to not incorporate these nonfunctional analogs, in favor for their natural counterparts. If this mutation occurs, transcription will not be halted, and viral proteins can be created. Research Applications * A study of hepatitis B in a Chinese population investigated the relationship of resistance mutations in the virus to its replication and genotype. It helped to gain insight into common mutations and their patterns. Patients undergoing treatment with a nucleoside drug were selected and fluorescence PCR and Sanger sequencing was used to sequence the viral genome. These sequences were compared against known hepatitis B sequences from Genbank so that the patterns of resistance could be analyzed. It was shown that many patients had a single mutation in common and many were also completely resist to a common nucleoside drug. In addition to gaining insight into mutation patterns, this study highlights the importance of using multiple types of drugs to treat chronic viral conditions. * An important part of treating HIV is patient-specific tailoring of drugs. A study identified the most common resistance mutations so that point of care tests could determine the resistance mutations of a patient, thereby allowing their provider to tailor their treatment. This point of care test would most likely be an inexpensive assay, which could significantly improve HIV treatment in impoverished areas. The researchers used datasets of the sequences of thousands of individuals around the world to identify the most common resistance mutations to NRTI, NNRTI, and protease inhibitors. Two NRTI mutations and four NNRTI mutations were commonly found, which can now be tested for using an inexpensive point-of-care. This will significantly improve care quality and effectiveness, especially in impoverished areas.

George Sanders committed suicide after making the film. Henson says \\"The story goes that George Sanders saw an answer print of Psychomania in Madrid.

I might as well go now‚Äô.\\" Plot Tom Latham, an amiable psychopath and the leader of a violent teen gang, enjoys riding his motorcycle with his girlfriend and loves his mother. His gang dabble in black magic and call themselves \\"The Living Dead\\". In a similar vein, his mother and her sinister butler get their kicks out of holding s√©ances in their home. With her help (and following in his father's footsteps) Tom returns from the dead. One by one, he and his fellow bikers commit suicide with the goal of returning as one of the \\"undead\\". One of them fails, but the ones who do return gather together at a secret place called \\"The Seven Witches\\" (a circle of standing stones), after which they continue to terrorize the locals. Cast Production It was produced by Benmar Productions, which predominately made Spaghetti Westerns in Spain but also produced Horror Express later that same year. (The film had the same writers as that movie.)* The film was shot under the title The Living Dead. It was filmed at Shepperton Studios in 1971 with some exterior scenes filmed in the (now demolished and rebuilt) Hepworth Way shopping centre and Wellington Close housing block in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. Nicky Henson said \\"I was a mad motorcyclist,\\" he adds, ‚ÄúI never had a car. So this script comes through the door and I open it up and it says, ‚ÄòEight Chopped Hog Harley Davidsons crest the brow of a hill.‚Äô I rang my agent and said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll do it'.\\" Henson said when he arrived on set he saw \\"eight clapped-out 350 AJS‚Äô and Matchless BSAs.

He says the stuntman who performed them were injured after each one. He says the script was written by \\"two expatriate Communist sympathisers\\" and that George Sanders' scenes were shot in ten days to save money as he was being paid more than anyone else in the cast. Henson says Sanders \\"was great fun on the movie. We laughed and laughed and laughed and spoiled an awful lot of takes. I mean, it must have been a nightmare for the director because we were all so young and behaving so badly and realized that we were all working on something that was kind of peripheral, that would just disappear. But of course it hasn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the weird and wonderful thing about it. People come up to me in the street and quote lines from it now.\\" Director Don Sharp called the film \\"great fun to do, especially after doing several films in a row like The Violent Enemy. It was a great change, geared for a younger audience as it was.\\"Midnight p 18 Soundtrack The film's soundtrack, composed by John Cameron, was released on LP and CD in 2003 by Trunk Records. Cameron later said, \\"‚ÄúI knew we needed a score that was spooky and different but had kind of a rock feeling to it and it was kind of pre-synthesizer...

It was designated a National Historic Landmark for its association with revolutionary textile manufacturer Nathan Appleton (1779‚Äì1861), and as the site in 1843 of the wedding of his daughter Frances and poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The house is an excellent early 19th century design of Alexander Parris. Description This pair of brick townhouses rise three stories, and are joined by a common firewall. When built in 1821, they were essentially mirror images of each other, differing in only relatively minor interior respects. Their main facades are each three bays wide, with the outer bay a rounded projection with two windows. The door to each unit occupied the center bay and is framed by a wooden surround and topped by a fanlight; a Doric portico provides shelter. At the top of each building a low balustrade conceals a low-pitched roof. In the 1870s a fourth floor was added; the original balustrades were retained. The rounded bays of number 39 were altered in the 1880s by the addition of a third window on each level, and what were originally single-story servant wings in the rear of each unit were extended and raised to three stories by later owners. History The property here had been owned by painter John Singleton Copley and much of the land had been purchased by Dr. John Joy, who headed a real estate company. In 1819, Nathan Appleton and business partner Daniel Pinckney Parker bought a house that had been standing on the property and tore it down. They then had the twin house built, designed by architect Alexander Parris and numbered 39 and 40 Beacon Street.Tharp, Louise Hall. The Appletons of Beacon Hill. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1973: 8. In 1843 Appleton's daughter Frances (Fanny) was married in this house to poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 165. . Appleton was one of the great financial minds behind the early industrialization of New England, funding the Boston Manufacturing Company and developing a strategy for selling its products. He parlayed this early success into the later development of major industrial complexes at Lowell and Lawrence, Massachusetts, and also Manchester, New Hampshire. Appleton lived at 39 Beacon Street from 1821 until his death in 1861. From 1914 to the 1990s it housed the Women's City Club of Boston. It has since been subdivided into condominiums. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

As of 2008 one creation is extinct while the other is dormant. The Warren Baronetcy, of Little Marlow in the County of Buckingham, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 1 June 1775 for the naval commander and politician John Borlase Warren. He was a descendant of Anne, daughter of Sir John Borlase, 1st Baronet (see Borlase baronets), hence his middle name. Warren had no surviving male issue and the title became extinct on his death in 1822. The Warren Baronetcy, of Warren Court's in the County of Cork, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 7 July 1784 for Robert Warren, High Sheriff of County Cork in 1752. The fifth Baronet served in the Crimean War and in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and was High Sheriff of County Cork in 1867. The eighth Baronet was a Colonel in the Royal Army Service Corps and served as Chief Constable of Buckinghamshire in 1928. The title became dormant on the death of the ninth Baronet in 2006. Five other members of the family may also be mentioned. Thomas Warren, third son of the first Baronet, was a Member of Parliament. His ninth son Brisbane Warren was the father of the Very Reverend Thomas Brisbane Warren, Dean of Cork.

It is largely a parody of The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. Like LOTR it is divided into three sections: Englebert the Enormous, Here Be Dragons and Doctor Cuddles of Giggle Glade. In 2011, a sequel titled Muddle Earth Too was published.  Plot Joe Jefferson, a boy from the ordinary world (Earth), has been summoned to Muddle Earth, a medieval fantasy world \\"full of monsters, mayhem, and more\\", by the wizard Randalf. He is then exhorted as a \\"warrior-hero\\". In other words, he must fight evil on behalf of Randalf, who has in turn been contracted by the ruler of Muddle Earth, the Horned Baron. The Horned Baron, however, has problems that even Randalf cannot attend to: his wife Ingrid is a very demanding woman. This is a trait that the evil villain Doctor Cuddles pays heed to, and uses to his advantage in all three sections of the novel.  Similarities to The Lord of the Rings Characters *Joe: the reluctant hero, who just wants to go home ‚Äì Frodo *Randalf: Incompetent wizard ‚Äì Gandalf *Brenda: the warrior princess.

Sequel In 2011 a sequel named Muddle Earth Too was published. It was also split into three parts, \\"Down with Stinkyhogs!\\", \\"The trouble with Big Sisters\\" and \\"Pesticide the Flower Fairy\\". It contains parody references from The Lord of the Rings, like its predecessor, but also throws in elements of Twilight, Harry Potter, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Hansel and Gretel, The Sword in the Stone, His Dark Materials and Sleeping Beauty. It follows Joe returning to Muddle Earth, through a wardrobe this time, with his big sister Ella (who made a minor appearance in Muddle Earth). He finds Randalf is now Headmaster of a new wizardry school named Stinkyhogs, built in the Horned Baron's castle after his retirement. They are competing against their rival school in the Muddle Earth annual game, Broomball, to win the Goblet of Porridge. But it has gone missing and Joe, Randalf, Ella and the others must go on a quest to find it. Along the way they meet the handsome Edward Gorgeous (Ella's love interest), the eccentric Lord Asbow, the peculiar Mr. Fluffy, the pompous Kings Edmund & Peter, the prissy Queens Susan & Lucy, and the ruthless, two-faced Edwina Lovely, before meeting the troublesome Pesticide and the flower fairies. The story features a great many more characters than Muddle Earth. Some of the major new characters include: *Pesticide ‚Äì A flower fairy. She steals the Goblet of Porridge to become rich but is \\"not evil\\", just misunderstood. She also appears in the CBBC series as Dr. Cuddles' accomplice and is depicted as a gothic fairy (her dress sense being intentional, often saying that she doesn't want to look like \\"something that's fallen off the top of the Christmas tree\\"). *Nettle, Thistle and Briar Rose ‚Äì Her accomplices, the flower faries. *Edwina Lovely ‚Äì The major villain in the story. She appears nice but is in fact a ruthless vampire. *Edward Gorgeous ‚Äì A handsome student at Stinkyhogs. He is in love with Ella. He has become a vampire because Edwina bit him. *Lord Asbow ‚Äì The eccentric Dean of the University of Whatever. Has a dog named Damien. *Eudora Pinkwhistle ‚Äì Muddle Earth's leading witch. A teacher at Stinkyhogs. Lives in Dr. Cuddles' old house. *Mr. Fluffy ‚Äì The woodwork teacher at Stinkyhogs. He is a werehamster. *Kings Edmund & Peter and Queens Susan & Lucy ‚Äì Pompous heads of Stinkyhogs' rival school. *Eraguff and Delia ‚Äì Dragons. *Mrs. Couldn't Possibly ‚Äì Asbow's assistant. *Smutley ‚Äì Grubley's son. *Mr. Polly ‚Äì A cyclops and teacher at Stinkyhogs. *Peat ‚Äì The bog-man. *Titiana and Oberon ‚Äì Pesticide's parents. Several new places appear in the story as well, some of which were briefly mentioned in Muddle Earth. New places include: *Definitely no Dragons here ‚Äì Only briefly mentioned in Muddle Earth. It is where the Kingdom of Kings Edmund & Peter and Queens Susan & Lucy lies. *Nowhere ‚Äì Briefly mentioned in Muddle Earth. It consists of the barbarian camp, the cake competition and King Arthur's palace. *The University of Whatever ‚Äì Run by Lord Asbow; contains many professors and their pets, all named Damien.  Other parody references *Potholes ‚Äì the meaning is taken literally, as a hole in the ground for pots for elves to cook things in: \\"What better place for a pot than a pothole\\". Variants include kettleholes. *The Teaspoon ‚Äì A small silver teaspoon. Revealed to be The Lord of the Teaspoons. > One teaspoon to rule them all, one teaspoon to heed them, one teaspoon to > bring them all to giggle glade and lead them! CBBC adaptations In late 2006, Muddle Earth was adapted as a one-off story for CBBC's Jackanory. The Jackanory version covers the Englebert the Enormous section only, with a light reading of the rest of the book towards the end. Muddle Earth is read by actor John Sessions and produced and directed by Nick Willing. In 2009, the BBC commissioned an animated series of Muddle Earth for broadcast in spring 2010. The series consists of 2 seasons of thirteen 11-minute episodes. The programme is produced by CBBC (making the programme its first ever in-house long-form animation series as well as the first CBBC programme with music composed by Maurizio Malagnini and performed by the BBC Philharmonic), with animation from the Manchester-based Hullabaloo Studios, and features David Jason as the voice of Randalf. Sarah Muller serves as executive producer.

Very similar in appearance to Joe from the original book. *Fang ‚Äì Dr. Cuddles' pet batbird, whom he uses as a spy and source of information. Is also willing to work for Pesticide. *The Fairies ‚Äì fairies that live in Fairy Valley, a location original to the CBBC series. Unlike traditional fairies, they are human-sized. They all wear dresses of varying colour, have different hairstyles and keep stiltmice as pets. The fairy with the bright blue dress is named Fifi and she appears to be their leader. Their sweetness comes from Fairy Dust; without it, they go out of control. *Various unnamed ogres *Gerald ‚Äì A snuggly-wuggly who was stolen from an ogre by Pesticide under Dr. Cuddles' orders and thrown into the Horned Baron's castle to frame him for the theft, so the Horned Baron was taken by the ogre. Gerald didn't want to be the ogre's snuggly-wuggly again and got his wish when the ogre took Dr. Cuddles instead (due to similarity in appearances). *Tallulah ‚Äì A red dragon with a nasty temper, and Margot's niece (the two dragons share similarities in appearance). Went on a rampage when her egg (which had her baby, Rupert, inside) was stolen. *The Babbling Brook ‚Äì A talking, gossiping river. Dr. Cuddles used her to turn Randalf and Norbert against each other, under threat of being drained of her water supply. When Dr. Cuddles fell in as Randalf and Norbert were getting to the end of their duel paces, she admitted the ploy to the two of them. *Mordrolf the Magnificent ‚Äì A wizard who was Randalf's old friend turned fraudulent thief. He had been stealing from all over Muddle Earth and usurped Randalf's position as official wizard to hide from the authorities. At the end of his episode, he was caught and was banned from practising magic and put on community service for his crimes (Randalf also jokes, \\"From now on, they can call him Mordrolf the Mucky!\\"). *Prince Lionel Wolfclaw ‚Äì the Prince of another land. His father can easily get annoyed should the prince be offended (which would be unlikely as he is oblivious to even Pesticide's actions against him) or should anything happen to him (which was almost made so by an irately uninterested Pesticide). In the end, he was sent to the Mirror Glacier to look for an \\"ice gremlin\\", but kept admiring his good looks there. *The Stinky Swamp Demons ‚Äì creatures that manifest themselves in the form of people's worst fears. Dr. Cuddles conjured up the Stinky Smog to bring them out and terrorise Goblintown on Muddle Earth Day. *The Toy Soldiers ‚Äì Computer-generated toy soldiers that Dr. Cuddles enchants in response to the Horned Baron's toy tax proposal. They then came to life on the thirteenth hour to capture the Horned Baron. They however turned against Cuddles when they were won over by Norbert's clothes-peg dolls. *The Horned Duke ‚Äì The Horned Baron's cousin. Wanted to take control of Muddle Earth from him. =CBBC on the web= As of October 2010 Muddle Earth World has been available to the public.Muddle Earth World It is a casual MMO. =CBBC soundtrack= On 10 January 2011, the soundtrack of the CBBC series was released for digital download.

The band self-released it through Ruffa Lane Records on 9 April 2007. The album is heavily influenced by 1960s soul music, featuring string and brass arrangements. Its romantic melodies are often accompany more doleful lyrics. The album received acclaim from music critics, who praised the careful fusion of Lucky Soul's influences. The Great Unwanted yielded five singles but did not find commercial success. Background and music The project began when Andrew Laidlaw was a university student in Scotland. He used a sampler to produce electronic music that he likened to The Avalanches and Saint Etienne. Wanting to achieve a more organic sound, he recruited additional musicians after he moved to London. The group began performing live in June 2005, starting with a performance alongside The Pipettes. As the group wrote songs, lyrics came from Laidlaw and drummer Ivor Sims, and other members prepared the instrumentation. Laidlaw also produced arrangements for string and brass. The band had George Shilling produce the album. The Great Unwanted is influenced by pop and soul girl groups of the 1960s. The full-scale string and brass arrangements add a sense of drama to the music. Its instrumentation draws from the emotional candidness of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound. Laidlaw also identified Motown and Stax Records as influences. He had a stated desire to balance retro influences with modern production techniques, explaining, \\"I love the old gear, but it's blinkered if that's all you use. There's plenty of good stuff that's happened in the past 30 years and we use the odd electronic twirl on our music.\\" Ali Howard's vocals were described as \\"unshowy\\" and \\"polished\\". Singer Ali Howard's melodies are romantic and bittersweet. The jubilant lyrics often belie melancholic themes. Howard's sweet, girlish vocals drew comparisons to Dusty Springfield and Sandie Shaw. Music critics noted similarities to alternative dance band Saint Etienne in Howard's affectionate presentation of tragic lyrics. Reception and release The Great Unwanted met with critical acclaim from music critics. The Independent on Sunday remarked that despite an initial period of hype \\"so long that one began to wonder whether they would ever actually deliver‚Ä¶The Great Unwanted is an immediate classic\\". The Times described the album as \\"something of a 'best of'\\" that measured up to the quality of \\"Lips Are Unhappy\\" and \\"Ain't Never Been Cool\\". The NME commented that although the band sometimes \\"slip over the line with one too many handclaps‚Ä¶mostly, it looks like a summer of love is coming their way.\\" PopMatters noted that many other independent bands had released works patterned after Motown girl groups but that \\"none has done it as completely and confidently as Lucky Soul does here, with as full a sense of the many dimensions one song can have.\\" The Guardian wrote that \\"Understatement isn't in their remit, but what a glorious, over-romanticised racket they make.\\" Pitchfork Media characterized the songs as \\"the type of sumptuous bubblegum that made an impressive showing on Pitchfork's 'The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s' but rarely places on year-end album lists.\\" Reviewers were generally positive regarding the album's reappropriation of retro styles. Metro wrote that there was a \\"mischievous sense of pastiche here in the careful calibration of retro references\\" but that the band \\"incorporate this knowingness with such disarming ease\\". AllMusic said that \\"the style never overwhelms the substance, which is to say that as extravagant as the lush, period-appropriate orchestrations get‚Ä¶it's all in the service of some top-notch songwriting.\\" Q noted that \\"There are pastiches here‚Ä¶but when they get it right, they can soar.\\" Uncut stated that although the band \\"may appear a bunch of whimsical pastiche-mongers‚Ä¶their debut performs the rare feat of meticulously acknowledging its inspirations‚ÄîThe Chiffons and The Shangri-Las via Dusty Springfield‚Äîwhile also transcending them.\\" PopMatters named The Great Unwanted the third best indie pop album of the year and placed the album at 41 on its list of the best albums of 2007. Metro also included the album on its year-end list. Pitchfork listed the album as one of the year's most overlooked records. BBC Radio 1 DJ Colin Murray, who supported the Ain't Never Been Cool EP, predicted the album would win the 2007 Mercury Music Prize; however, it failed to make the shortlist. Believing it would be difficult to attract the attention of a major label, the band decided to self-release the album through their own Ruffa Lane Records. Cost prevented them from pressing it on vinyl, so the band initially made it available as a CD and digital download. Luis Calvo, owner of Madrid-based independent label Elefant Records, found Lucky Soul through the Internet and asked about releasing The Great Unwanted in Spain. The band agreed, citing the label's success with Camera Obscura. The album's critical attention failed to translate into sales, and it sold 50,000 copies worldwide. At the end of 2007, Last.fm users selected \\"Lips Are Unhappy\\" for a \\"Christmas Chart Attack\\". Lucky Soul re-released the song with a cover of Mud's 1974 Christmas single \\"Lonely This Christmas\\". Singles \\"My Brittle Heart\\" was released in March 2006 as the band's debut single, with B-side \\"Give Me Love\\". It was followed three months later by \\"Lips Are Unhappy\\", released as a signed 7\\" vinyl single. The song pairs a prominent rhythm section with melancholic, soulful vocals. A black-and-white music video was produced for it, in which Ali Howard is shown obscured by shadows. An EP for \\"Ain't Never Been Cool\\" was released in January 2007. It includes ballad \\"I Gots the Magic\\" and album track \\"Struck Dumb\\". A limited release of a 7\\" single for \\"Add Your Light to Mine, Baby\\" followed in March. The song was used as the theme song for Japanese TV series Takeshi's University. Its music video is colourful, showing the band in full dress. \\"One Kiss Don't Make a Summer\\" became the album's final single in September 2007, with B-side \\"That Hollywood Glow\\". Its lyrics detail the outcome of a summer romance.

Marching along the river Boarn the Frankish army reached the mouth of the river where it used to flow into the Bordine estuary or Middelsee.

Diagram showing the 1986 orbital configuration of DOS-7. Kvant-1. Mir ( lit: Peace), DOS-7, was the first module of the Soviet/Russian Mir space station complex, in low Earth orbit from 1986 to 2001. Generally referred to as either the core module or base block, the module was launched on 20 February 1986 on a Proton-K rocket from LC-200/39 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The spacecraft was generally similar in design to the two previous Soviet orbital stations, Salyut 6 and Salyut 7, however possessed a revolutionary addition in the form of a multiple docking node at the forward end of the module. This, in addition to the docking port at the rear of the spacecraft, allowed five additional modules (Kvant-1 (1987), Kvant-2 (1989), Kristall (1990), Spektr (1995) and Priroda (1996)) to be docked directly to DOS-7, greatly expanding the station's capabilities. Designed as a 'habitat' or 'living' module, DOS-7 possessed less scientific apparatus than its predecessors (lacking, for instance the large imaging camera which had partially obstructed the living areas of previous stations), instead providing crews with a comfortable living area on the station. Other changes made to DOS-7 from its predecessors included larger solar arrays and a new power system, greater automation and a new docking system, Kurs, in addition to the older Igla system. The spacecraft also featured a small trash/science airlock, and an aluminium hull (about 1 to 5 mm thick) with several portholes with hatches for viewing out. Inside, the spacecraft featured two-toned colours, fluorescent lighting, and one toilet. The module was launched unmanned, and first crewed by the two members of EO-1, launched aboard Soyuz T-15 on 13 March 1986. After 52 days, they left Mir and visited Salyut 7 for 51 days, then returned to Mir for 21 additional days, before returning to Earth on 16 July 1986. This is the only occasion in history when a crew transferred between two different space stations.  Description  The Mir Core Module (DOS-7) design was based on the earlier DOS based Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 space stations. However, there were many key differences which included better computers and solar arrays. It was designed to comfortably fit two cosmonauts each having their own cabin. The Core Module also had six docking ports. Four of them, which were located radially on the node on the front of the module, were called \\"berthing\\" ports designed for station expansions. The other two ports were located laterally, one located at the node and the other located at the aft of the module, were designed for routine Soyuz and Progress dockings. Mir had two engines, located aft, which were designed for orbital maneuvers. Each engine was capable of 300 kg of thrust, although these engines could not be used after April, 1987 with the arrival of the Kvant-1 module at the station's aft port. Christmas in Mir Core Module (DOS-7) The main purpose of the Core Module throughout the station's lifetime was a living area. It was equipped with a lavatory, two cabins for sleeping and privacy, entertainment including movies and music, exercise equipment, and medical equipment. The core also included a command center with televisions screens for communication with TsUP (the Earth command center for the station). In June 1987, a third solar panel was deployed from the Core Module. It was delivered inside of Kvant-1. This increased solar panel area of this module from 76 m2 to 98m2. At one point, it was planned for Buran to visit the station around 1992 and exchange the existing core module for a new one. A grappling arm would transfer the attached modules to the new core, and then take the original core module back to Earth. The module reentered the Earth's atmosphere along with the rest of the Mir Space Station when the station was intentionally de-orbited in March 2001. Any remaining fragments landed in the South Pacific Ocean.

Kvant-2 was divided into three compartments. They were the EVA airlock, the instrument/cargo compartment, and the instrument/experiment compartment. The instrument/cargo compartment could be sealed off and act as an extension or a back-up to the airlock. Before Kvant-2 docked to the station, EVAs had to be carried by depressurizing the docking node on the Core Module. Kvant-2 also carried the Soviet version of the Manned Maneuvering Unit for the Orlan space suit. It delivered the Salyut 5B computer which was an improvement over the Argon 16B computer already on the station. Kvant-2 had a system for regenerating water from urine and a shower for personal hygiene. It carried six gyrodynes to augment those already located in Kvant-1. Unlike Kvant-1, Kvant-2's gyrodynes were only accessible from the exterior which made replacement of failed ones more difficult. Scientific equipment on Kvant-2 included a high-resolution camera, spectrometers, X-ray sensors, the Volna 2 fluid flow experiment, and the Inkubator-2 unit which was used for hatching and raising quail.

Marino was involved in the construction industry and the operation of theatres. Marino and his brother Anthony JJ Lucas, were amongst the first Greeks in Melbourne who contributed significantly to advancing the causes of local Greeks but also the community in general.  Childhood  Marinos Lekatsas was born to Ioannis (John) Lekatsas (a clergyman) and his wife Magdalene (n√©e Palmos) in the small village of Exoghi, on the Greek island of Ithaca in the Ionian Sea. Ithaca is famed for the Homeric tales of Ulysses.  Migration  In 1886, Marinos left Ithaca shortly after his brother Anthony JJ Lucas. Their destination ‚Äì Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. In the 1932 obituary for Lucas that appeared in The Herald newspaper (now the Melbourne Herald Sun), reference was made to the fact that a relative of Marino's had visited the country and returned to Ithaca with tales of great potential in the distant land. This relative was most probably Andreas Lekatsas. Andreas Lekatsas had arrived in 1845, only 10 years after the foundation of Melbourne in 1835 by John Batman. Odysseus was said by Homer to be the leader of the \\"Kefallinians\\", the literal interpretation of which is given as an explanation as to why modern inhabitants of the islands have a keen interest in travelling to other countries. It is likely however that the primary reason for their emigration from the island was its somewhat unstable political situation during those times. Ithaca had been under Venician control until defeat by Napoleon in 1797, when it transferred to French rule. The French were subsequently succeeded by the Russians and Turks in 1798. In 1809, Ithaca was then subject to English rule under the auspices of the \\"United States of the Ionian Islands\\" plan. It was thus governed by a Constitution imposed in 1817. During English occupation, the Ithacecians participated in the War of Independence of 1821, joining the Hellenic Revolutionary fleet against the Turks. The English 'occupation' of the Ionian Islands lasted until 1864. In that year Ithaca was finally liberated and, with the other Ionian Islands, became a part of the New Greek State. Ionian History website The nearby island of Corfu was at the time home to families of the current Prince Philip of Great Britain. The first monarch of this new Greek dynasty George I, King of the Hellenes, was actually Danish. At his enthronement in Copenhagen in 1863 attended by a delegation of Greeks, it was announced that the British government would cede the Ionian Islands to Greece in honor of the new monarch.The Times (London) 8 June 1863 p.12 col.C  Early years  It was perhaps this British influence over the Ionian Island and Ithaca during the mid-19th century that influenced Marino and his brother to leave Greece for the young colony of Australia, at that time established for less than 100 years. After their arrival in Australia and no doubt a great amount of hard work and cultural adjustment, Marino and Anthony prospered. One inevitable byproduct of moving to what was an overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon nation, was the need to modify their surname. Consequently, Lekatsas became 'Lucas'. The brothers became interested in both the building industry and the theater. As the following excerpt from the Victorian Government Immigration website details, some of the immigrants may have been undecided as to whether their new home was to be a permanent one: > Greeks had been establishing new lives in Australia since the Victorian gold > rush of the 1850s. Many Greeks were amongst the sailors who left their > English ships in Australian waters when they heard the discovery of gold. > Most intended to return home rich men, so few women came to join them. By > 1871, there were still only 19 Greece-born women in Victoria, and 127 men. > After the gold declined, those who stayed found work in restaurants, cafes > and shops.Origins: History of immigration from Greece ‚Äì Immigration Museum, > Melbourne Australia  Construction  Melbourne in 1886 was still undergoing the influence of the discovery of gold in nearby fields. This had a significant impact on the wealth of Melburnians and resulted in a boom period of residential and industrial construction. Combining their interests in entertainment and building, the two brothers were instrumental in the construction of theatres in the southern states of Australia. One of Marino's projects in the immediate post World War 1 period was The Victory theatre in Wattletree Road, Malvern (currently a Spotlight fabric outlet). The 1498-seat Victory operated as a dedicated theatre from 1920 to 1956 and was subsequently used as a supermarket and now fabric store. It's false ceilings still allegedly cover the original from 1919.Cinema Tour website (including current pictures) Anthony JJ Lucas, in collaboration with American architect Walter Burley Griffin (noted for his earlier design of the Australian capital Canberra), went on to renovate and operate the Vienna Cafe, and the Hotel Australia and most notably the Capitol Theater in the heart of Melbourne.  Hobart  In 1907 Marino Lucas arrived in Hobart, Tasmania. Continuing his interests, he furthered his involvement with the entertainment industry and not only built but operated theatres, at one stage acting as the manager of the Grand Tivoli Vaudeville Company. He also became involved in cinema and even the making of a film.Neos Kosmos ‚Äì Greeks of the Apple Isle  Princess Theatre, Launceston  In 1911 Marino succeeded in building a theatre of his own design in Brisbane Street, Launceston. With a capacity audience of almost 1,900, the Princess Theatre was referred to in the Daily Telegraph newspaper at the time, as the only theatre in Tasmania with such up-to-date appliances, and which are equal to any in other states.Kythera-Family.net Lucas' efforts with the theater are noted in the following quote from The Launceston Examiner of Monday 28 August 1911. > Costing between ¬£14,000 and ¬£15,000 the Princess was built for Mr Marino > Lucas, a vaudeville entrepreneur from Hobart. All the work except for the > stamped metal ceilings was done in Launceston. Messrs J & T Gunn were the > contractors for the building, decoration and electric lighting.. The Theatre > was built to hold 1800 people \\"comfortably\\". There were two cloakrooms in > the upstairs foyer, one for the ladies with a \\"huge swinging mirror\\" and one > for the gentlemen. It is probably best not to wonder about the 1200 patrons > who were seated downstairs. In 1913 he returned to Melbourne, remaining there until 1916. Again moving to Launceston he built another theatre, The Majestic, which opened in 1917 and was evidently influenced by Lucas' Ithacecian roots. The architecture is Grecian, commented the Launceston Daily Telegraph, and at the top one can see glimpses of the ancient Pantheon style. The paper concluded that 'the Majestic Theatre is undoubtedly one of the most modern in Australia.Princess Theater/Theater North website A 1914 census entry listed Marino Lucas' address as 42 The Avenue, St. Kilda, whilst the 1916 Secret Census recorded seven Tasmanians of Greek extraction, two of them living in Launceston. Marinos Lucas (Lekatsas) nominated himself as a picture theatre proprietor aged 47. By 1918, he was listed at 97 Westbury Street, St. Kilda and in 1922 at 62 Gourlay Street. In the 1927 census he was shown to be residing at his final address, 67 Alexandra St. St. Kilda. A British website investigating 'haunted' theatres states that at Launceston's Princess there are Reported incidents of temperature drops, heavy footsteps, and piano being played.Arts Info  Melbourne  In 1895, Marino had married Elizabeth Eutrope (b:1864 d:1955), one of eight children to Fricaud Eutrope (a chef from Rochefort, France) and Maria Hughes (from County Mayo, Ireland). With Eutrope, he had six children: Sylvia Maria (b:1896), Thelma, Anthony (b:1896), Homer Mareeno (b:05/02/1897 d:15/05/1954), Alfred Ulysses (b:1900 d:1919) and Anthony William (b:1905 d:1927). Marino and his entire family had also travelled to New Zealand, one of his children having been born during his stay in Bluff on the South Island. After finally returning to Melbourne in the early 1920s, Lucas purchased the mansion Fairholme in Alexandra Street, East St. Kilda. He subsequently subdivided a portion of the north-eastern section of the grounds and built five residential houses in the then popular California Bungalow style. After his death on 28 September 1931 at the height of the Great Depression, the mansion was sold, becoming a reception hall and is today modified for use as The Rabbinical College of Australia & NZ Marino's many descendants now live in and around Melbourne.

L. barbicornis is New Zealand's longest beetle, and shows extreme sexual dimorphism: males measure up to 90 mm, and females 50 mm, although there is an extreme range of body sizes in both sexes. In males the elongated snout (or rostrum) can be nearly as long as the body. Male giraffe weevils use this long rostrum to battle over females, although small males can avoid conflict and 'sneak' in to mate with females, sometimes under the noses of large males. The larval weevils tunnel into wood for at least two years before emerging, and live for only a few weeks as adults.  Taxonomy  Female New Zealand giraffe weevil This species was described by the Danish entomologist Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775, from specimens collected by Joseph Banks in 1769 on Cook's first voyage to New Zealand, presumably from Ship Cove in Queen Charlotte Sound. Fabricius described the smaller females as a different species, Curculio assimilis, but suspected they were the males of what he named Curculio barbicornis (later moved to its own genus, Lasiorhynchus). His specimens are now in the Banks Collection of the Natural History Museum, London, and the Fabricius Collection in the Natural History Museum of Denmark. L. barbicornis is occasionally accused of not being a weevil at all, but it fact it is in the family Brentidae, the straight-snouted weevils, as opposed to the much larger family Curculionidae or \\"true\\" weevils; brentids lack the distinctive elbowed antennae that characterise curculionid weevils. These and several other families are part of the superfamily of all weevils, Curculionoidea. L. barbicornis is the only member of the Brentinae (a tropical subfamily) in New Zealand, and its closest relatives are in Sulawesi, Australia, Vanuatu, and Fiji. It is the only member of the genus Lasiorhynchus.  Etymology  Lasiorhynchus means \\"densely hairy rostrum\\"; barbicornis (\\"bearded horn\\") refers to the dense black backward-directed beard underneath the male's rostrum, or possibly to its hairy antennae. The beetle's MƒÅori names include pepeke nguturoa (\\"long-beaked beetle\\": ngutu roa is another name for kiwi), t≈´whaipapa, and t≈´whaitara, the latter two after the MƒÅori god of newly made canoes, because its canoe-like body and upturned rostrum resemble a waka and prow.  Description  Male and female L. barbicornis, showing how the placement of antennae is determined by the female's need to drill into wood. Illustration by Des Helmore. Giraffe weevils have a distinctive elongated head, and reddish-brown markings on their elytra. They are the only weevils in the world with a visible scutellum. They are New Zealand's longest native beetle, and the longest brentid weevil in the world. They vary enormously in size, from 15‚Äì90 mm total length in males and 12‚Äì50 mm in females. This wide variation in body size, particularly in the length of the male rostrum, may be in response to changing environmental conditions from year to year. Body size increases the further south the weevils live, but male rostra get proportionately less long with increasing latitude. These weevils display extreme sexual dimorphism; males have an elongated rostrum or snout with antennae at the tip, which they use as a weapon for fighting over females. The female giraffe weevil has a shorter rostrum with antennae about halfway along, which allows her to bite egg-laying holes in tree trunks without damaging her antennae. Giraffe weevils are mostly active by day, sheltering in the canopy at night, and feed on sap. When suddenly disturbed, they will drop backwards off a tree trunk and lie in the leaf litter, playing dead, for up to an hour. Life cycle 400x400px Eggs are laid on dying wood from October to March. The female bores a narrow hole with her mandibles into the trunk, pulling her head out every half-millimetre to clear away sawdust. During this time the male mates with and guards her, and helps her disengage with the hole if she gets stuck. The hole is usually 0.5 mm wide, 3‚Äì4 mm deep, and at a 45¬∞ angle to the trunk of the tree. When finished, she lays a single egg in the hole, which is then refilled with sawdust and hidden with bark fragments. The whole process takes around 30 minutes. An adult male Lasiorhynchus barbicornis emerging from a tree Fighting frequently occurs if a single male comes across a mating pair: the single male will attempt to dislodge the mating male by raking his mandibles across the back of his rival, or grasping his opponent's leg with his mandibles (this is possibly the reason some males have missing leg sections.) The fight then escalates to grappling, where the males engage side by side and try to push each other off the tree with their rostra. Small males (under 30 mm) are less able to compete with large males, and often retreat rather than fight. Small males, though, will readily fight with smaller or equal-sized males. They can also find success by mating while the larger males are distracted by fighting; these 'sneaking' males will flatten themselves alongside or underneath females in order to avoid detection by a larger male. Due to these varied mating tactics, mating success is independent of male size. Because female giraffe weevils can mate multiple times before they lay their eggs, sperm competition is likely to be an important factor in determining which males get to reproduce. L. barbicornis larvae live at least two years. Dissections of larvae show they feed on fungus growing in the larval tunnels, not the wood itself. During the pupal stage, the weevil's rostrum is doubled underneath the body, but it straightens when the adult beetle emerges and eats its way out of the tree, leaving a square tunnel. Sometimes the tunnel is too narrow, and the adults perish with their rostrum protruding. Adults emerge between October and March; their peak abundance is in February. The sex ratio is about 60:40 males:females. Adult giraffe weevils generally only live for a few weeks, although one male was recorded as living at least 29 days.  Distribution and habitat  Giraffe weevils are common in the North Island, and, although rarer, are found in the northwestern South Island as far south as Greymouth. One has been recorded from the Hollyford Valley in Fiordland. Mitochondrial DNA suggests that during the Pleistocene ice ages giraffe weevils were only found in the remnant forests of Northland, and have expanded southward during this current interglacial. They are found in native forest, mainly at lower altitudes. Their larvae inhabit at least 17 species of native trees, including lacebark, pigeonwood, rewarewa, tawa, pukatea and rimu, but are especially common on karaka and mahoe.

In Byzantium, the office was eventually transformed into a senior honorary rank, simply called magistros (ŒºŒ¨Œ≥ŒπœÉœÑœÅŒøœÇ), until it disappeared in the 12th century. History and functions =Late Roman Empire= The insignia of the Eastern magister officiorum as displayed in the Notitia Dignitatum: the codicil of his office on a stand, shields with the emblems of the Scholae regiments, and assorted arms and armour attesting the office's control of the imperial arsenals. Although some scholars have supported its creation under Emperor Diocletian (), the office can first be definitely traced to the year 320, during the reign of Roman emperor Constantine the Great (), but was probably created sometime soon after 312/13, probably as part of an effort to limit the power of the praetorian prefect (praefectus praetorio) the Roman emperor's chief administrative official. The magister was first given command of the palace guard, the Scholae Palatinae. He was also appointed head of the palatine secretariats, divided into four bureaux, the sacra scrinia, each under a respective magister: the scrinium memoriae, the scrinium epistularum, the scrinium libellorum and the scrinium epistolarum Graecarum. The first bureau handled imperial decisions called annotationes, because they were notes made by the emperor on documents presented to him, and also handled replies to petitions to the emperor. The second handled correspondence with foreign potentates and with the provincial administration and the cities, the third dealt with appeals from lower courts and petitions from those involved in them, and the fourth handled the documents issued in Greek and the translation of Latin documents into Greek. Constantine also transferred the supervision of the agentes in rebus, a corps of trusted messengers who also functioned in a bureaucratic role as monitors of the imperial administration, to the magister. Control of the feared agentes, or magistriani as they were also known, gave the office great power. The office rose quickly in importance: initially ranked as a regimental commander, tribunus, by the end of Constantine's reign the magister was a comes and member of the imperial consistorium was one of the top four palatine officials (along with the quaestor sacri palatii, comes rerum privatarum and comes sacrarum largitionum). In order of precedence in 372 they ranked in the highest of senatorial ranks, illustres, behind the prefects, urban prefects and highest generals. The magister became a kind of \\"Minister of Internal Security, Administrative Oversight and Communications\\".Giardina, Andrea, Aspetti della burocrazia nel basso impero, Edizioni dell‚ÄôAtneo & Bizzarri, 1977, pp. 45-93 The holders of the office were the emperor's chief watchdogs. Almost all routine business was channeled to the office of the magister through the secretariats from other ministries such as the prefectures, the Treasury ('res summa, from 319 the Sacrae Largitions,') the Crown Estates ('res privata') which performed the function in this respect as control points or bottle bottles to catch and vet information (though higher officials and military officers always had the right and duty to communicate with the emperors if the matter was important enough).Giardina ‚Äúthe agentes in rebus were part of a widespread system of control. There were various sectors of the government which they operated in as guarantees of political security. These sectors covered all vital nerve tissue bundles (‚Äúganglia‚Äù) (or focuses of strength metaphorically) of the State from the lines of communication to imperial defense factories, from the transmission of messages to the command of the civil service bureaux, to prevent rebellion, to control the administration and apply the laws: sore points for the late ancient State, and for this reason a subject of great concern to the central government and, what‚Äôs more if one thinks about it, the reason for the very frequent orders concerning the collective responsibility of government departments. The presence of agentes in rebus, who through long familiarity with administrative functioning, were experts in jobs of varying responsibilities must have guaranteed the efficient carrying out of technical work, administrative surveillance and political control,‚Äú p. 71 In a move that further strengthened the authority and power of the magister, sometime in the early 340s Sometime in the early 340s he was made inspector-general of the cursus publicus, the State Post. Perhaps at the same time, senior agentes were appointed as heads (principes) of the staffs of the most important provincial governors: the praetorian prefects, the vicars of the dioceses, and the proconsuls of the provinces of Africa and Achaea. The placements gave the magister, and by extension the emperor, on-the-spot \\"watchdogs\\" over the upper echelons of the administration, as the princeps was a key position: his role was to control the staff, not to do paperwork;Palme, Bernhard, ‚ÄòDie Officia der Statthalter in der Spatantike,‚Äô Antiquite Tardive, 7, 1999, pp. 108-110 he composed confidential reports directly for the magister officiorum, without the praetorian prefect's involvement,A. Piganiol, L‚Äôempire chretien (325-395), 1947, p. 321 ‚Äúlui-meme ne depend pas des prefets du pretoire, mais directemente du prince; le prefet ne peut intercepter ses rapports, et c‚Äôest au prince, non pas au prefets, qu‚Äôon fait appel des decisions judicaires du vicaire,‚Äù p. 354. and vetted all business coming in and going out of the office and countersigned all documents.Codex Theodosianus 6, 28 4 (387 = Codex Justinianus 12, 21, 1) A law of 387 forbids the legal staffs of the prefects and vicars from instituting legal proceedings without the princepss permission or order (as an additional means of determining the validity of a legal suit.Codex Theodosianus 6, 28, 4 (387); 6 (399) = Codex Justinianus 12, 21 1; 6 (399); 8 (435) =Codex Justinianus 12, 21, 4 The office's powers were further enhanced in the eastern (or Byzantine) half of the Empire in 395, when Emperor Arcadius () stripped the Praetorian Prefecture of the East of some of its jurisdiction over the cursus publicus, the palace guard (Scholae Palatinae) and the imperial arsenals (fabricae) and handed them to the magister officiorum. These last changes are reflected in the Notitia Dignitatum, a list of all offices compiled circa 400.Notitia Dignitatum, Pars Occ. IX and Pars Orient. XI. In the year 443 the eastern magister was made inspector-general of the border army units or limitanei and was ordered to bring them up to full strength and effectiveness. In the course of time, the office also took over the coordination of foreign affairs (already in the late 4th century, the official translators and interpreters were under the control of the magister officiorum for this reason), and in the East, the Notitia records the presence of four secretaries in charge of the so-called Bureau of Barbarians under the magister's supervision. One of the most important incumbents of this office was Peter the Patrician, who held the position from 539 to 565 and undertook numerous diplomatic missions in this role for Emperor Justinian I (). The office was also retained in Ostrogothic Italy after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and was held by eminent Roman senators such as Boethius and Cassiodorus. =Byzantine Empire= The office survived as a bureaucratic function in the eastern (or Byzantine) half of the Roman Empire, but during the late 7th or the 8th century, most of the office's administrative functions were removed, and it was converted into the dignity of magistros (Greek: ŒºŒ¨Œ≥ŒπœÉœÑœÅŒøœÇ, female form magistrissa, ŒºŒ±Œ≥ŒØœÉœÑœÅŒπœÉœÉŒ±). At least until the time of Emperor Leo VI the Wise (), however, the full former title was remembered: his powerful father-in-law, Stylianos Zaoutzes, is recorded once again as \\"master of the divine offices\\" (). In his administrative functions, the magister officiorum was replaced chiefly by the logothetƒìs tou dromou, who supervised the Public Post and foreign affairs, while the imperial bodyguard was transformed into the tagmata. vestƒìs, and stratƒìlatƒìs of the East Herv√© Frankopoulos Until the reign of Emperor Michael III () there seem to have been only two magistroi, the senior of whom was termed pr≈çtomagistros (œÄœÅœâœÑŒøŒºŒ¨Œ≥ŒπœÉœÑœÅŒøœÇ, \\"first magistros\\"), and who was again one of the senior ministers of the state (without specific functions) and head of the Byzantine Senate. From the reign of Michael III on, the title was conferred on more holders, effectively becoming a court rank, the highest in the Byzantine hierarchy until the introduction of the proedros in the mid-10th century. The List of Precedence (Klƒìtorologion) of Philotheos, written in 899, implies the existence of 12 magistroi, while during the reign of Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (), the western envoy Liutprand of Cremona recorded the presence of 24. The rank continued in existence thereafter, but lost increasingly in importance. In the late 10th and 11th centuries, it was often held in combination with the title of vestƒìs. From the late 11th century it was considerably devalued, especially in the Komnenian period, and disappeared entirely by the mid-12th century.

Nick Carter, Master Detective was a Mutual radio crime drama based on tales of the fictional private detective Nick Carter from Street & Smith's dime novels and pulp magazines. Nick Carter first came to radio as The Return of Nick Carter, a reference to the character's pulp origins, but the title was soon changed to Nick Carter, Master Detective. A veteran radio dramatist, Ferrin Fraser, wrote many of the scripts. Program history With Lon Clark in the title role, the series commenced 11 April 1943, on Mutual, continuing in many different timeslots for well over a decade. Between October 1944 and April 1945, it was heard as a 30-minute program on Sunday afternoons at 3pm, sponsored by Acme Paints and Lin-X, with a 15-minute serial airing four or five times a week in 1944 from April to September. In April 1945, the Sunday series moved to 6pm, continuing in that timeslot until June 1946, and it was also heard in 1946 on Tuesday from March to August. Sponsored by Cudahy Packing and Old Dutch Cleanser and later Acme Products (makers of such home-improvement chemicals as Kem-Tone paints and Lin-X floor-cleaning waxes, a near-rival to the more- popular Johnson's Wax products heard on numerous NBC Radio shows at the same time), the series finally settled in on Sundays at 6:30pm for broadcasts from August 18, 1946 to September 21, 1952. Libby Packing was the sponsor when the drama aired on Sundays at 6pm (1952‚Äì53). In the last two years of the long run (1953‚Äì55), the show was heard Sundays at 4:30pm. Jock MacGregor was the producer-director of scripts by Alfred Bester, Milton J. Kramer, David Kogan and others. Background music was supplied by organists Hank Sylvern, Lew White and George Wright. Walter B. Gibson, co-creator/writer of The Shadow pulp novels, was fired when he asked for a raise in 1946, and then became head writer for the Nick Carter radio series. Oddly enough, he never liked to write scripts for the radio version of The Shadow, though both characters were published by Street & Smith. Patsy Bowen, Nick's assistant, was portrayed by Helen Choate until mid-1946; then Charlotte Manson stepped into the role. Nick and Patsy's friend was reporter Scubby Wilson (John Kane). Sgt. Mathison (Ed Latimer) was Nick's contact at the police department. The supporting cast included Raymond Edward Johnson, Bill Johnstone and Bryna Raeburn. Michael Fitzmaurice was the program's announcer. The series ended on September 25, 1955. =Chick Carter, Boy Detective= Chick Carter, Boy Detective was a serial adventure that aired weekday afternoons on Mutual. Chick Carter, the adopted son of Nick Carter, was played by Bill Lipton (1943‚Äì44) and Leon Janney (1944-45). The series aired from July 5, 1943 to July 6, 1945. On film Walter Pidgeon played Nick Carter and Donald Meek played Bartholomew in three films produced by MGM: Nick Carter, Master Detective (1939), Phantom Raiders (1940), and Sky Murder (1940) Several films covering Carter's adventures were released during the silent era.

A rival firm in West Germany found out about the incident and made the details public. As punishment, May was given a lifelong ban from participating on behalf of the GDR. He also lost his job as an unpaid employee at the Erfurt newspaper Das Volk, and therefore had to work from then on as a sports teacher. New start in the FRG In 1967 May took advantage of an offer to move to West Germany, where he was able to continue his career as a sportsman. He was selected by the German Athletics Federation for the 1969 European Championships. However, the team boycotted the European Championships and participated only symbolically in the relay competitions. May did not succeed in obtaining a foothold in international competitions again. In 1970 in Stockholm he pulled out of the European Cup final at short notice due to a tooth operation. He pulled out of the 1971 European Championships in Helsinki in advance. His last international competition was the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich where he failed to qualify for the final in the 5000 metres. Afterwards he retired from competitive sport.

Plevris (; born 1939 in Athens), known sometimes in English as Constantine Plevris or Kostas Plevris, is a Greek politician, lawyer and far right author. A prolific writer, over the course of decades he has authored a number of books and other texts relating to Greek history, Greek culture, sociology, and politics, with a clear nationalist, homophobic (such as his book titled \\"ŒüŒπ ŒöŒØŒΩŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒøŒπ\\", a vehement polemic against homosexuals) content. In his book The Jews: The Whole Truth he described himself as a ‚ÄúNazi, fascist, racist, anti-democrat, anti-Semite.‚Äù He was the founder and leader of the Metaxist 4th of August Party and Front Line, with the former political party not only playing a significant role in influencing and shaping the future direction of the Greek extreme right, but also standing in its own right as a prominent pre-junta political movement in general. He has also cooperated (according to interviews he gave to various publications, including one to Italian magazine L'Europeo in 1976, which were quoted and accepted as proof in a court of law where he was the plaintiff against author Nikos Kleitsikas) with various European neo-fascist groups (including the Ordine Nuovo), and figures such as Pino Rauti, Pino Romualdi, Giorgio Almirante, and others of the same ilk. He later briefly joined the right-wing party Popular Orthodox Rally, as its leading candidate in the 2004 elections. He is father of Thanos Plevris, former member of the Greek parliament with the Popular Orthodox Rally party. In December 2007, Plevris was initially found guilty of inciting racial hatred by a Greek court based on excerpts and quotations in his book The Jews: The Whole Truth. He appealed the court ruling and on 27 March 2009 the court of appeals overturned the ruling of incitement with 4-1 votes. Plevris was cleared on the charge of having caused violence by the 5-member court, but it was noted that he was a Holocaust denier. The court justified his acquittal by saying that \\"\\"The defendant does not revile the Jews solely because of their racial and ethnic origin, but mainly because of their aspirations to world power, the methods they use to achieve these aims, and their conspiratorial activities.\\" The ruling prompted some charges of miscarriage of justice.\\"ŒëŒ∏œéŒøœÇ (ŒºŒµ 4-1) Œø Œ†ŒªŒµœçœÅŒ∑œÇ Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒø Œ≤ŒπŒ≤ŒªŒØŒø œÑŒøœÖ œÄŒµœÅŒØ ŒïŒ≤œÅŒ±ŒØœâŒΩ\\" Eleftherotypia, 31 March 2009\\"Triumph des Rassisten\\" S√ºddeutsche Zeitung 30 December 2009\\"Plevris\` acquittal signals that authorities in Greece fail to take firm action to curb racism\\", Minority Rights Group International, 17 April 2009\\"European Jewish Congress Calls Greek Neo-Nazi‚Äôs Ruling ‚ÄúMiscarriage of Justice‚Äù \\", European Jewish Congress, 7 April 2009\\"Greek court clears anti-Semite writer\\" Press TV, 27 March 2009 Education and academic background Plevris graduated from the Lyc√©e L√©onin.

As a professor, he taught political sociology and psychological warfare at the School of Police Officers and the Faculty of General Education of the Hellenic Army General Staff. Controversy =Terrorism charges= In 1977, Plevris was brought up on charges of incitement of terrorist activities (bombing attacks), along with Aristotelis Kalentzis, who was accused of being the perpetrator of these acts. Plevris claimed that Kalentzis was never a member of his 4th of August Party and admitted that he informed the authorities of weapons and explosives possessed by Kalentzis. Plevris was cleared of the incitement charges, while Kalentzis was sentenced to 12 years in prison; this caused Kalentzis to write several books accusing Plevris of being a para-state agent and a snitch that framed him.Œó Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÉŒ∫ŒµœÖŒÆ œÑŒøœÖ œáŒ±œÜŒπŒ≠ - Œ≤ Eleftherotypia, 23 June 1996 =Lawsuit against Nikos Kleitsikas= In his 2000 book The Greek Student Movement in Italy Nikos Kleitsikas write that Plevris was a CIA or Mossad agent during the Cold War and participated in bombings. Plevris successfully sued Nikos Kleitsikas and the publisher of the book, Aggelos Sideratos, for libel in the summer of 2006. The Greek court of appeals vindicated him and the defendants were forced to pay 15,000 euros in compensation for the not well documented claim that Plevris organized and participated in provocative acts to pave the path for the coup d'√©tat that brought into power the Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì1974, but the court found and accepted that the defendant proved Plevris' fascist leanings, as well as his connection with European neo-fascist terrorist groups and personalities (such as Pino Rauti and the far-right terrorist group Ordine Nuovo), his collaboration with the Greek junta and his collaboration with various secret services, based on Plevris' own statements in interviews he had given.\\"Œü Œ†ŒõŒïŒ•Œ°ŒóŒ£ ŒöŒëŒôŒïŒô Œ§ŒüŒù ŒöŒëŒ°ŒëŒ§ŒñŒëŒ¶ŒïŒ°Œó - ŒüŒªŒØŒ≥ŒøŒΩ Œ±Œ∫œÅŒøŒ¥ŒµŒæŒπŒøŒØ;\\" Eleftherotypia, 16 January 2005 =Lawsuit over Jews: The Whole Truth= Konstantinos Plevris is the author of Jews: The Whole truth, a book containing outright praises for Adolf Hitler and openly questioning the Holocaust, published by Adonis Georgiades in June 2006.

They also brought charges against the newspaper Eleftheros Kosmos (published by Golden Dawn party's former second-in-command Dimitris Zafeiropoulos), which published extracts of the book.KIS Lawsuit Against \\"Eleftheros Kosmos\\" and Konstantinos Plevris, 1 August 2007 Panagiotis Dimitras of the Greek Helsinki Monitor began to visit the Public Prosecutor's Office of District Court Judges on a daily basis to push the public prosecutors for legal action against Plevris and nationalist weekly newspaper Eleftheros Kosmos, which published extracts of the book, on charges of racism.(Originally retrieved and accessed: 30 August 2007) K.I.S. Lawsuit Against \\"Eleftheros Kosmos\\" and Konstantinos Plevris, 1 August 2007 After two months, and the support of the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece, he eventually succeeded and so, in December 2006, Plevris was indicted for violation of Article 191 of the Penal Code, the dissemination of false news. Several weeks later Eleftheros Kosmos and Plevris learned that they were being taken to court under the Greek Anti-Racist Law of 1979., a fact they say they were never informed of, although Plevris quoted this particular law in its entirety in his book. They held that the case should be thrown out for this reason alone, although the argument that one did not know the law is not acceptable in a Greek court of law. Both Plevris and Eleftheros Kosmos characterized the lawsuit as an attempt to suppress free speech. According to Plevris, this lawsuit had no legal basis because it was, to quote Plevris, a \\"violation of articles 320, 321 (paragraph 1), and 111 (paragraph 7) of the Greek Penal Code\\".(Originally retrieved and accessed: 30 August 2007) Jews Are Bringing Us to Court, 30 July 2007 Because this is the first time the aforementioned law has ever been used in Greek judicial history, this law is regarded as historic by both sides. In the book, Plevris describes himself as a \\"Racist, anti-democrat, anti-Semite\\" (p. 600), subscribes to the myth of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (which he presents as authentic and valid evidence against the Jews), characterizes Jewish children in the concentration camps as \\"very fat\\" and \\"well-fed\\", claims that Jews are \\"subhuman\\" (p. 583) \\"mortal enemies\\", and criticizes the Nazis for \\"not ridding Europe of Jewish Zionism\\". In the same book, he characterizes former UN secretary Kofi Annan as \\"cannibal\\" and \\"descendant of cannibals\\" and states that Jews need to be \\"rounded-up and executed within 24 hours\\", which is \\"the only way they understand\\" (p. 742). However, Plevris contends that \\"Of the 1,400 pages of my large book, the condemnation encompasses only several paragraphs, of which portions were extracted, with the result that another meaning was given to the words and truth is distorted due to the alteration of phrases\\". The first hearing, which was set for 5 September 2007, was postponed until 11 September 2007.(Originally retrieved and accessed: 7 September 2007) K.I.S. and E.P.S.E Postpone Trial of Eleftheros Kosmos, 5 September 2007 The trial began on 11 September 2007 but, due to time constraints, it was again postponed, this time to 3 December 2007. On the first court date, 150 supporters, mainly from neo-Nazi and nationalist groups, attended to show moral support for Plevris and Eleftheros Kosmos and over 200 police officers were stationed in the area out of fear that there would be clashes. However, the planned anti-fascist gathering never materialized and there were no incidents. On December 13, 2007 the court found Plevris guilty of inciting racial hatred and handed him a 14-month suspended sentence. His co-accused, the publisher, editor and a journalist of Eleftheros Kosmos were found not guilty. Plevris condemned the verdict, stating that \\"Jews are trying to fight me with this trial so they can shut my mouth\\".\\"Lawyer is sentenced for racism\\", Kathimerini, 14 December 2007 Plevris appealed and was eventually acquitted on 27 March 2009; his acquittal caused a controversy as to whether the Greek justice system failed to enforce Greece's antiracist legislation. Counter-lawsuit over Jews: The Whole Truth In response to publications of Eleftherotypia's \\"Ios\\" which depicts Jews: The Whole Truth as a \\"Fascistic and anti-Semitic\\" book and Plevris as a \\"Fascist\\", Plevris launched a SLAPP- type libel suit against the newspaper for the sum of ‚Ç¨1.2 million. All four journalists of \\"Ios\\" and its editor-in-chief publisher were sued for ‚Ç¨200,000 each. Plevris also sued Panagiotis Dimitras of the Greek Helsinki Monitor for the sum of ‚Ç¨200,000 as compensation for libel. In addition, Plevris counter- sued all seven executive members of the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece for ‚Ç¨200,000 each.(Originally retrieved and accessed: 30 August 2007) Lawsuit Against \\"Ios\\" From Plevris, 1 April 2007 (Originally retrieved and accessed: 30 August 2007) Plevris To Holy Synod: Take a Position on the Talmud, 29 April 2007 He dropped the charges in May 2013 and the court determined that the defendants had not made false accusations.

Analysis  \\"To a Wreath of Snow\\" is Emily writing as the character Augusta Almeda, the Queen of Gondal. Gondal was a fantasy world created by Emily and Anne three years previously. The context in which this poem was written suggests that Emily was attempting to escape the reality of her sister's illness by falling back into the fantasy world they created together. Emily describes the snow as a \\"transient voyager of heaven\\" and \\"angel like\\", suggesting that she sees the snow as coming directly from God. In addition, the fact that the poem is addressed to the snow, gives it status. This is then reinforced when she describes the mountains \\"crowned\\" in snow. When Emily was alive, royalty was seen to be chosen by God and so this imagery portrays the snow as being a gift from God. The use of \\"crowned\\" and \\"silvery\\" also presents the snow as being precious. Sibilance is used most successfully in stanzas one and five. Emily uses sibilance to imitate the sound and atmosphere she is trying to describe. In stanza one she is imitating the \\"silent sign\\" and in stanza five she is trying to create the serene atmosphere that is \\"soft\\" and \\"sweetly spoke\\" by using the soft \\"s\\" sound repeatedly. Emily uses punctuation throughout to emphasise her meaning. The first two lines of stanza one both begin with \\"O\\" and end with an exclamation mark which suggests that these lines are bursts of Augusta's (and therefore possibly Emily's) emotions. Emily also uses caesura in the first line in stanza four. By use of repetition and the comma in \\"For many a week, and many a day\\", Emily mimics the length she is describing. Juxtaposition and contrasting images are used highly effectively in stanza four. Emily uses a metaphor of Augusta's heart \\"sinking\\" when the morning \\"rose\\". This creates an image that when one thing goes down something else has to go up. This could therefore suggest that to compensate for God's gift of the snow falling, Anne's life has to be a gift back to God.

It first aired on CBS in the United States on April 3, 2007. The episode is written by John Kelly and directed by James Whitmore, Jr., and was seen by 13.79 million viewers. An NCIS team, led by Special agent Paula Cassidy, receives a tip about terrorist activity but it turns out to be a trap, resulting in the death of two agents. Cassidy, grief-stricken, begins blaming herself for what happened. Gibbs and his team are sent to investigate the deaths with Cassidy joining them during the investigation. While Ducky is sure that the man who Cassidy received the tip from was dead at least one day before the explosion even happened, Cassidy and Abby insist otherwise. The episode marks the final appearance of NCIS Special agent Paula Cassidy, who is killed when she sacrifices herself to stop a suicide bomber. Plot Two NCIS agents are killed when they follow a possible lead inside a building, which explodes. Both agents are part of NCIS Agent Paula Cassidy's team, leaving her the only one surviving the attack. Originally, Gibbs' team was supposed to be on duty for the week-end, but it was later changed by Gibbs. Dr. Mallard proposes that the man who was in the store was a suicide bomber. Two men, Wahid and Malik, come to the store, telling the team that they are part of The Muslim Coalition for Peace that works there. Ziva finds the head of the suicide bomber, and Wahid and Malik tell the team that it's the head of their chapter president, Yazid, who was planning a conference. Later, back at the crime scene, DiNozzo finds an escape route through the wall, which the terrorist used. The team later finds that Ducky was right in saying their tip had died the day before and the terrorist had used a computer to digitally make it sound like the actual person to lead the team into a trap. The conference continues to go forward, with a special memorial for Yazid at the building that blew up held by high-ranking Muslim clerics, who Gibbs figures to be the real targets. Malik comes out from behind the trick wall, primed with explosives on his chest. Cassidy jumps and tackles Malik, throwing him back behind the wall, and the door automatically closes behind them while also preventing Gibbs and DiNozzo from interfering. In her final moments, Cassidy sees her teammates standing before her. Seconds later, the bomb then explodes, killing her and Malik while the sheer force of the explosion causes the building to shake. The team are left devastated by Cassidy's death and following on from the attack, Tony arrives at Jeanne's apartment, having finally gained the courage to tell Jeanne he loves her. He does so and then embraces her while crying for Cassidy as R.E.M.'s Everybody Hurts plays in the background. Production The episode is written by John Kelley and directed by James Whitmore, Jr. \\"Grace Period\\" refer to earlier deaths of NCIS agents. Gibbs told DiNozzo \\"it could have been us every single day and week, and sometimes it has\\", as shown in the episode \\"Twilight\\" when NCIS special agent Kate Todd is shot dead. In the commentary track on the DVD, Michael Weatherly says that \\"the last time [Tony] put a black band across the [NCIS] badge, it was a hole in agent Todd's forehead\\". The reason why Cassidy's team had the weekend duty, not Gibbs' as it originally was intended to be, is explained by Weatherly to be because Gibbs wanted to spend some quality time with Hollis Mann instead, as shown in the start of the episode. Together with the focus on dead NCIS agents, the thought about being the one themselves is another big part of the episode. Especially McGee and DiNozzo talks about it, leading up to the death of agent Cassidy at the end of the episode. According to Michael Weatherly, who portrays NCIS Special agent Tony DiNozzo, it takes about 9 days to shoot an episode like \\"Grace Period\\". Three characters are recurring in the episode: Scottie Thompson as Jeanne Benoit, Susanna Thompson as Army Lt. Col. Mann and Jessica Steen as Paula Cassidy. Cassidy was last seen in season 3 episode \\"Mind Games\\", while Benoit and Mann has been in numerous episodes in season 4. Reception \\"Grace Period\\" was seen by 13.79 million live viewers following its broadcast on April 3, 2007, with a 4.9 share among all households. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program.

On June 15, 1892 he married Helen Van Uxem,Helen Van Uxem (August 4, 1871 - January 25, 1952) - aka \\"Nettie\\" Van Uxem. a fellow student he had met at Indiana University. He was superintendent of schools in San Diego, California from 1896 until 1898. He joined the faculty of Stanford, then went to Columbia University where he earned a Ph.D. in 1905. He returned to the Stanford faculty in 1906 as a professor of education. He was the dean of the Stanford school of education from 1917 until he retired in 1933. Works Cubberley published a total of 30 works during his life, including: * Syllabus of Lectures on the History of Education, 1902 online * Changing conceptions of education (Houghton Mifflin Company, 1909) online * Public Education in the United States, 1919 online * The history of education: Educational practice and progress considered as a phase of the development and spread of western civilization (Houghton Mifflin, 1920) online * Readings in the History of Education, 1920 online * A Brief History of Education, 1922 online * Public School Administration, 1922 online * Public Education in the United States, republished in 1947 * State and county educational reorganization ; the revised constitution and school code of the state of Osceola, 1914 online Influence For much of the 20th century, the dominant historiography of schooling in America was exemplified by Cubberley. His many textbooks emphasized the rise of American education as a powerful force for literacy, democracy, and equal opportunity, and a firm basis for higher education and advanced research institutions. He advocated enlightenment and modernization over ignorance, cost-cutting, and traditionalism in which parents tried to block their children's intellectual access to the wider world. Teachers dedicated to the public interest, reformers with a wide vision, and public support from the civic-minded community were the heroes. The textbooks helped inspire students to become public school teachers and thereby fulfill their own civic mission.Lawrence A. Cremin, The Wonderful World of Ellwood Patterson Cubberley (1965) Cubberley was perhaps the most significant theorist of educational administration of his day. At the outset of Cubberley's career, school administration had no theoretical or scientific basis. There were no formal textbooks from which to teach educational administration; educational administrators were expected to learn solely from experience. Indeed, educational administration posts were often political plums requiring little, if any, formal training in education. Most universities lacked education departments. Cubberley pioneered the use of the school survey as an instrument to improve education, in his reports on the schools in Baltimore, Maryland; New York City; Oakland, California; Portland, Oregon; and Salt Lake City, Utah. In conducting surveys, he applied an integrated theory of organization, administration, and teaching, to assess the strengths and weaknesses of individual schools. He used the latest statistical and quantitative methods. His surveys were significant steps down a new road toward improving school functions. Cubberley's work influenced the establishment of the factory model of curriculum implemented widely throughout North America well into the 21st century. Cubberley's academic legacy has been controversial. Since his death in 1941, Cubberley's impact has been attacked, most memorably by Lawrence Cremin's The Wonderful World of Ellwood Patterson Cubberley (1965). Some academicians have used Cubberley's methodology as a cautionary tale and termed his approach anachronistic and evangelistic, and some of his administration stances have been attacked as sexist and autocratic.

Since 1971 it is legally independent and organized in the form of a GmbH, owned and financed equally by the Max Planck Society and the Steel Institute VDEh. It conducts basic research on advanced materials, specifically steels and related metallic alloys.  History  The institute was founded as Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Iron Research in Aachen 1917, with Fritz W√ºst being the founding director. It moved 1921 to D√ºsseldorf and relocated from the \\"Rheinischen Metallwarenfabrik\\" to its current location in 1935. In 1943, it move temporarily to Claustahl and in 1946 back to D√ºsseldorf. The 50% institutional co-sponsoring by industry (by Steel Institute VDEh) determines a unique example of a public private partnership both for the Max-Planck Society and for the European industry and should guarantee a close match between knowledge-oriented and pre-competitive basic research on the one hand and commercial relevance on the other hand.  Fields of research  The Institute plays a central role in enabling progress in the fields of mobility (e.g. steels and soft magnets for light-weight hybrid vehicles and Ni-base alloys for plane turbines), energy (e.g. efficiency of thermal power conversion through better high temperature alloys and nanostructured solar cells), infrastructure (e.g. steels for large infrastructures, e.g. wind turbines and chemical plants), and safety (e.g. nanostructured bainitic steels for gas pipelines). The Institute with its international team of about 300 employees is organized in four departments: * Computational Materials Design (Prof. J. Neugebauer) * Interface Chemistry and Surface Engineering (Prof. J. Neugebauer, temporarily while Prof. M. Stratmann is on leave) * Microstructure Physics and Alloy Design (Prof. Dierk Raabe) * Structure and Nano-/Micromechanics of Materials (Prof. G. Dehm) In addition to departmental research, certain research activities are of common interest within the MPIE. These central research areas are highly interdisciplinary and combine the experimental and theoretical expertise available in the different departments. The main five cross-disciplinary topics are: * New Structural Materials * Microstructure-Related Material Properties * Stability of Surfaces and Interfaces * Scale-Bridging Simulation of Materials * Energy Materials In many of these areas the Institute holds a position of international scientific leadership, particularly in multiscale materials modeling, surface science, metallurgical alloy design, and advanced structure characterization from atomic to macroscopic scales of complex engineering and functional materials.

Some botanists have now revived the synonym Hellenia speciosa for this species.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, Hellenia speciosa (retrieved 23 September 2020: also Plants of the World Online and IPNI) It is native to southeast Asia and surrounding regions, from India to China to Queensland, It is especially common on the Greater Sunda Islands in Indonesia. It is also reportedly naturalized in Mauritius, R√©union, Fiji, Hawaii, Costa Rica, Belize, Melanesia, Micronesia, and the West Indies. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental.Pacific Island Invasive Species Description Cheilocostus speciosus and other members of the Costaceae differ from gingers by having only one row of spirally arranged leaves. The species reproduces vegetatively by rhizome, and birds disperse the seeds when they feed on the fruits. This plant is cultivated in South Asia and Southeast Asia for its medicinal uses, and is cultivated elsewhere as an ornamental. In some areas Cheilocostus speciosus is introduced and has become an invasive species. Habitat The habitat where this species is found is roadside ditches and low-lying areas in tropical forests. Flowering starts after onset of the rainy season. Human relevance The plant has many historical uses in Ayurveda, where the rhizome has been used to treat fever, rash, asthma, bronchitis, and intestinal worms. It is mentioned in the Kama Sutra as an ingredient in a cosmetic to be used on the eyelashes to increase sexual attractiveness. It is used to treat kidney problems and other urinary problems in Mizo Traditional Medicine. It was used as a traditional medicine by Malays when evil spirits have possessed a body, as well as for the treatment of high fever, smallpox and as a purgative. Cheilocostus speciosus has a large number of common names in many languages, including isebsab (Palauan); keu, kemuk or keumul (Bengali); keukand (Hindi); thebu (Sinhala); pakarmula (Gujarati); pushkarmula (Marathi and Sanskrit); jom lakhuti (Assamese); kostam (Tamil); Kosta (Kannada); Kostamu (Telugu); Okchak Khombi (Manipur) sumbul (Mizo); setawar (Malay).

Background The album was recorded in late 1969 at Olympic Studios in London. It was their first album with new members John Weider on bass and Poli Palmer on keyboards, flute and vibraphone. The past several months had been full of setbacks for Family. Rick Grech left for Blind Faith, Jim King was forced to leave for getting too deep into drug addiction, and their first U.S. tour proved to be a disaster. Although many of the songs had been written with King's saxophone in mind, Charlie Whitney and Roger Chapman were able to rework them with Palmer's instruments, and Palmer quickly made himself integral to Family's sound. Because some of these songs had been debuted in live performances in the previous year, many Family fans found themselves getting accommodated to arrangements that sounded radically different from what they expected. Much of A Song for Me shows Family exploring various popular forms, from jazz and blues to folk and country.

Even though it comes with MRDS, it is not limited to modelling robotic behavior but can be used to express asynchronous behavior in any application. CCR runtime includes a \`Dispatcher\` class that implements a Thread pool, with a fixed number of threads, all of which can execute simultaneously. Each dispatcher includes a queue (called \`DispatcherQueue\`) of delegates, which represent the entry point to a procedure (called work item) that can be executed asynchronously. The work items are then distributed across the threads for execution. A dispatcher object also contains a generic \`Port\` which is a queue where the result of the asynchronous execution of a work item is put. Each work item can be associated with a \`ReceiverTask\` object which consumes the result for further processing. An \`Arbiter\` manages the \`ReceiverTask\` and invokes them when the result they are expecting is ready and put on the \`Port\` queue. In May 2010, the CCR was made available along with the entire Robotics Developer Studio in one package, for free.
