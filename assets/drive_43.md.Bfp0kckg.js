It is an excellent thermal insulator and among the least dense solids known. SEAgel was invented by Robert Morrison at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 1992. SEAgel is made of agar, a carbohydrate material that comes from kelp and red algae, and has a density of 200 mg/cm3. SEAgel can be made lighter than air using hydrogen, causing it to float or hang in the air. It insulates against temperature, noise, and electric current. SEAgel is also completely biodegradable, as it is made entirely of biological material and can even be eaten.Discovery Channel Initially, SEAgel starts out as a gelatin-like mixture of agar and water. After it is freeze- dried to remove the water, it is left as a honeycomb of dried agar filled with air, with cell sizes two to three micrometers (2-3 ¬µm) in diameter. SEAgel can have many different uses. Laboratory scientists use SEAgel as targets for x-ray laser experiments because it can be doped with other materials, such as selenium. In order to eliminate the volatile hydrodynamics that occur when a solid-density target explodes before it reaches the density required for lasing, scientists are trying to develop an x-ray laser target with a density that is less than the critical density of laser light (4√ó1021 electrons/cm3 for 0.53-¬µm light). SEAgel can help them achieve a more uniform plasma, which will ultimately improve the quality of the x-ray laser beam. SEAgel could also be used as food packaging or the encapsulating material of timed-release medical pills, as it is safe to digest. SEAgel could also replace balsa wood, to insulate supertankers, and to provide sound damping in high-speed trains. SEAgel was covered under U.S. patents 5,382,285 (\\"Biofoam\\") and 5,360,828 (\\"Biofoam II\\").  References   External links  * Physics News Update ‚Äî (Story #4), August 19, 1992 by Phillip F.

Vaikundar, realizing that forbearance and fortitude were the essential virtues needed in his project of transforming the world, becalmed himself and performed the Tavam (Meditation). Having justice in his breath, the thought of mercy in his mind, and renouncing the desires of the body and containing the tendencies of his ego, Vaikundar performed the Tavam concentrating totally on the commands he had received from his father.

It used a photograph collected by Fred Hultstrand as the basis for the art. The photograph originally taken by John McCarthy used as the basis for the stamp.Fred Hultstrand (September 13, 1888 - June 28, 1968) was a professional photographer whose work helped document life in the U.S. state of North Dakota in the early 20th century. Background Hultstrand was born on a farm in Fairdale, North Dakota. He was the third of six children born to Swedish immigrants. He attended school in Osnabrock, North Dakota. In 1905, Hultstrand witnessed his neighbor developing negatives in the basement of his home and was fascinated. In 1909, he paid to be an apprentice with John McCarthy, a photographer in Milton, North Dakota. He went to Wallace, Idaho, to photograph lead and zinc mines. The next year, he went to study his art at the Illinois College of Photography in Effingham. After studying there for two years, he continued his studies at the Art Institute of Chicago. He made his way back to North Dakota, where he would spend the rest of his life. Career On November 14, 1917, Hultstrand married Eva Baker, an immigrant from Canada with whom he would have two children. He purchased the photography studio in which he would work for the rest of his days in Park River, North Dakota. There, he offered portrait photographs, as well as film development and framing services. He would also work on the photographs that documented rural farm life in North Dakota in that era. In 1937 Hultstrand served as president of the North Dakota Photographers' Association. In 1962, the United States Department of the Treasury used one of the photographs that Hultstrand had collected as a basis for a stamp that commemorated the 100th anniversary of the Homestead Act. It featured the John and Margret Bakken family standing outside of their sod house near the town of Milton. The government of Norway issued a stamp (Utvandringen til Amerika : Norge) celebrating the 150th anniversary of Norwegian emigration to the United States, using the same photograph.

Life and career Dean was born in Nottingham, England, moving to Tooting, London, soon after his birth.Bennett 2005, pp. 176-177. From 1966 to 1967, Dean was a member of the band Bluesology, led by Long John Baldry. The band's pianist, Reginald Dwight, afterward combined Dean's and Baldry's first names for his own stage name, Elton John. This fact is noted in the 2019 film Rocketman, a biopic of the life and career of Elton John, where Dean is portrayed by Evan Walsh.IMDB - Evan Walsh Dean established his reputation as a member of the Keith Tippett Sextet from 1968 to 1970, and in the band Soft Machine from 1969 to 1972. Shortly before leaving Soft Machine he started his own group, Just Us. From 1975 to 1978 he led a nine- piece band called Ninesense, performing at the Bracknell Jazz Festival and similar events. Following this, his own groups were usually quartets or quintets, and most often worked in the free jazz mode, with little or no pre- composed material, such as Soft Heap with Mark Hewins.Stephen Yarwood, Elton Dean interview, Facelift (\\"issue 20 - the issue that never happened!\\"). However, he also continued to work with other groups that were very composition-based, such as guitarist Phil Miller's In Cahoots, drummer Pip Pyle's Equipe Out, and various projects with former Soft Machine bassist Hugh Hopper. In 2002, Dean and three other former Soft Machine members (Hugh Hopper, drummer John Marshall, and guitarist Allan Holdsworth) toured and recorded under the name Soft Works.Bennett 2005, p. 398. With another former Soft Machine member, guitarist John Etheridge, replacing Holdsworth, they subsequently toured and recorded as Soft Machine Legacy, playing some pieces from the original Soft Machine repertoire as well as new works. Featuring Dean, three albums of the Legacy have been released: Live in Zaandam (CD, rec. 2005/05/10), New Morning - The Paris Concert (DVD, rec. 2005/12/12) and the studio album Soft Machine Legacy (CD, 2006, rec. 2005). Dean's last musical collaborations also included those with Soft Bounds, a quartet composed of Dean, Hugh Hopper, Sophia Domancich and Simon Goubert, and also with Alex Maguire's project Psychic Warrior. Dean died on 8 February 2006 after more than a year of heart and liver problems. He was replaced in Soft Machine Legacy by Theo Travis.

They include Kelleys Island, Pelee Island, the Bass Islands, and several others. The majority of these islands are under the sovereignty of the State of Ohio in the United States. Pelee Island is the only major inhabited island within the province of Ontario, while the smaller Middle Island is the southmost point of land in Canada. Most of the larger islands are popular tourist attractions, served by car ferries running from the mainland and between some islands. Some small airports and numerous private marinas offer other ways for visitors to reach the islands. Combined with nearby Sandusky and Port Clinton, Ohio, the islands are part of the collective area known regionally as \\"Vacationland\\".\\"Vacationland\\" history - Sandusky Library Geology Depth map showing the three basins of Lake Erie. The islands are in the westernmost, shallowest basin. Glacial grooves stemming from the Wisconsin glaciation at Kelleys Island, Ohio The Lake Erie Islands are geologically part of the Silurian Columbus Limestone. When the Pleistocene ice sheets carved out the basin of modern-day Lake Erie, these hard rocks proved more resistant to erosion than the shales in the east, and as a result, Lake Erie's western end is much shallower than the basins in the east, so that the islands remain above water. Quarrying operations on Kelleys Island revealed glacial grooves in the bedrock, which would in time be regarded as some of the best direct evidence of the Pleistocene ice sheets available anywhere. The glacial grooves are now protected as part of Kelleys Island State Park.Publishers: (1) Lake Erie Coastal Ohio Trail National Scenic Byway (2) Ohio Chapter of The Nature Conservancy (3) Ohio Sea Grant; Editors: Art Weber, Melinda Huntley of the Ohio Sea Grant College Program, Explore the Lake Erie Islands , Retrieved September 1, 2014, (see page 5) \\"...Lake Erie‚Äôs shallow, nutrient-rich western basin and the much deeper central and eastern basins....The western basin... dolomite and limestone are more durable than the softer shales ... glacier dug through the stones ... resistance from the dolomite and limestone in the western basin...\\" Economy Most of the islands are supported financially via tourism. Grape growing and wineries were once the mainstay of the economy. Kelleys Island is heavily forested and woods have replaced vineyards there almost entirely. South Bass Island is more developed and still has a few vineyards. Pelee Island is the only major island where vineyards remain common. Limestone quarrying still occurs on Kelleys Island, and also there are a few hobby farms. South Bass, Middle Bass, North Bass, and Kelleys Islands all have active state parks part of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources with North Bass Island State Park being the largest at 593 acres and 90% of North Bass Island (also known as Isle St. George). Residents Most of the islands are headed by a small group of year-round residents. However, eager vacationers often raise the populations dramatically during the summer months, most notable on South Bass Island, which is the most tourist-friendly of the islands despite its small size. The islands vary by year-round population of approximately 500 on South Bass Island, 100 for Kelleys Island, 40 at Middle Bass Island and 12 on North Bass Island. Kelleys Island, Middle Bass, North Bass and South Bass (Put-in-Bay) have active school districts with North Bass Local School District being the last operating one-room schoolhouse in Ohio. Of the islands with year-round residents, only North Bass has no ferry service. Put-in-Bay Township Port Authority operates public airports for Middle, North and South Bass Islands.

The drugs that enter the human tend to stimulate certain receptors, ion channels, act on enzymes or transporter proteins. As a result, they cause the human body to react in a specific way. There are 2 different types of drugs: *Agonists - they stimulate and activate the receptors *Antagonists - they stop the agonists from stimulating the receptors Once the receptors are activated, they either trigger a particular response directly on the body, or they trigger the release of hormones and/or other endogenous drugs in the body to stimulate a particular response.  Short note on receptors  Drugs interact with receptors by bonding at specific binding sites. Most receptors are made up of proteins, and the drugs can therefore interact with the amino acids to change the conformation of the receptor proteins. These interactions are very basic, just like that of other chemical bondings: =Ionic bonds= Mainly occur through attractions between opposite charges; for example, between protonated amino (on salbutamol) or quaternary ammonium (e.g. acetylcholine), and the dissociated carboxylic acid group. Similarly, the dissociated carboxylic acid group on the drug can bind with amino groups on the receptor. This type of bond is very strong, and varies with the inverse of the distance between the atoms so that it can act over large distances. Cation-œÄ interactions can also be classified as ionic bonding. This type of interaction occurs when a cation, e.g. acetylcholine, interacts with the negative œÄ bonds on an aromatic group of the receptor. Ion-dipole and dipole-dipole bonds have similar interactions, but are more complicated and are weaker than ionic bonds. = Hydrogen bonds = There is a small but significant attraction between hydrogen atoms and polar functional groups (e.g. the hydroxyl [-OH] group). These so-called hydrogen bonds only act over short distances, and are dependent on the correct alignment between functional groups. Receptors are located on all cells in the body. The same receptor can be located on different organs, and even on different types of tissues. There are also different subtypes of receptor which elicit different effects in response to the same agonist. For example, there are two types of histamine receptor: H1 and H2. Activation of the H1 subtype receptor causes contraction of smooth muscle, whereas activation of the H2 receptor stimulates gastric secretion. It is this phenomenon that gives rise to drug specificity. Of course, drugs do not only act on receptors: they also act on ion channels, enzymes, and cell transporter proteins. these hydrogen bonds are so powerful than the ionic bonds.  How shape of drug molecules affect drug action  When talking about the shape of molecules, biochemists are mainly concerned with the three-dimensional conformation of drug molecules. There are many isomers of a particular drug, and each one will have its own effects. Differences in isomer affect not only what the drug activates, but also changes the potency of each drug. = Potency = Potency is a measure of how much a drug is required in order to produce a particular effect. Therefore, only a small dosage of a high potency drug is required to induce a large response. The other terms used to measure the ability of a drug to trigger a response are: *Intrinsic Activity which defines: **Agonists as having Intrinsic Activity = 1 **Antagonists as having Intrinsic Activity = 0 **and, Partial Agonist as having Intrinsic Activity between 0 and 1 *Intrinsic Efficacy also measures the different activated state of receptors, and the ability for a drug to cause maximum response without having to bind to all the receptors. = The specificity of drugs = Drug companies invest significant effort in designing drugs that interact specifically with particular receptors , since non-specific drugs can cause more side effects. An example is the endogenous drug acetylcholine (ACh). ACh is used by the parasympathetic nervous system to activate muscarinic receptors and by the neuromuscular system to activate nicotinic receptors. However, the compounds muscarine and nicotine can each preferentially interact one of the two receptor types, allowing them to activate only one of the two systems where ACh itself would activate both. = Affinity = The specificity of drugs cannot be talked about without mentioning the affinity of the drugs. The affinity is a measure of how tightly a drug binds to the receptor. If the drug does not bind well, then the action of the drug will be shorter and the chance of binding will also be less. This can be measured numerically by using the dissociation constant KD. The value of KD is the same as the concentration of drug when 50% of receptors are occupied. The equation can be expressed as KD = \\\\frac{[drug][receptor]}{[complex]} But the value of KD is also affected by the conformation, bonding and size of the drug and the receptor. The higher the KD the lower the affinity of the drug. References External links *Drug Action - Merck Manual Home Health Handbook *Pharmacology.

About  In Dallas, abandoned railroad tracks that had once divided the downtown core are rapidly being transformed into the unifying Katy Trail, a linear , landscaped pedestrian, inline skating and bicycle trail system that runs through the most densely developed section of the city. Construction was started in spring 2000. Several features have already been completed, including the primary trail, two of four new entrance plazas and four of the six planned pedestrian bridges. Construction was completed in 2007 on the Thomsen Overlook plaza, overlooking Reverchon Park. An secondary jogging trail has left of construction, which will be completed once more funding is secured. The work is being carried out by The Friends of Katy Trail under a master plan created by The SWA Group office, in Dallas.The SWA Group Sign mapping the Katy Trail The trail consists of a concrete pathFriends of the Katy Trail - Master Plan . Retrieved October 15, 2006. for pedestrians and cyclists that runs from the American Airlines Center in Victory Park to Mockingbird Station (a DART light rail station) near Southern Methodist University. Next to the concrete path, a parallel soft recycled-rubber track is built for runners. This adaptive re-use of unused railroad tracks‚Äîlong a public eyesore and nuisance‚Äîunifies several important Dallas districts and provides a major recreational amenity for the more than 300,000 people who live and work within a mile of the trail (the southernmost trailhead is from downtown Dallas at the American Airlines Center). This new, partly completed linear greenway already attracts pedestrians and nature- lovers, both Dallas residents and visitors. The Katy Trail is also directly responsible for an upsurge in property values and retail-restaurant sales in adjacent neighborhoods and developments. The April 21, 2006, The Dallas Morning News called Katy Trail \\"one of our city‚Äôs favorite outdoor spaces\\". Katy Trail has become such a popular jogging location that some Dallasites quip, \\"The trains don‚Äôt run here any more...Dallas does.\\"  History  The trail's life began when the Union Pacific Railroad, which had bought the Katy, donated the abandoned lines to the city in 1993. The train tracks that are now the location of the Katy Trail formed the major east-bound route through Dallas of the former Missouri-Kansas-Texas (MKT or \\"Katy\\") Railroad, which shut down this segment of its network in the late 1980s. The stations, which had served Dallas residents on their trips east for so many years, were torn down, but the tracks remained. In the early 1980s The Katy was initially considered for DART's Red and Blue lines to the Northeast, but the current route beneath Central Expressway was chosen instead. By the early 1990s, Dallas residents, business people, and city and county officials proposed restoring the greenbelt along the railroad route and creating an urban park as part of the national Rails-to-Trails Conservancy program, established in 1986 and based in Washington, D.C. Looking down at Harry Hines Boulevard from a Katy Trail pedestrian bridge Looking down at Cedar Springs Road from a Katy Trail pedestrian bridge Initial funding for the project came through Dallas County and state grants. The Friends of the Katy Trail, a nonprofit organization, was founded in 1997 to organize public and private support for development and maintenance of the Katy Trail. Their capital campaign has since raised $11 million from government sources and $12 million from private funding and land donations. The Katy Trail is intended to provide an effective way of connecting the various Dallas city parks running from White Rock Lake to the Trinity River Project park system along the Trinity River. The rail trail runs alongside Reverchon Park and the parks system along Turtle Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River.  Master plan  Originally, the Dallas Park & Recreation Department planned a basic concrete pathway system along the railroad right of way. The Friends of the Katy Trail have greatly expanded that vision by hiring The SWA Group, an international landscape architecture, planning, and urban design firm, to create a $23 million master plan for two trails and an urban park connecting the West End district to Mockingbird Station. View from Katy Trail where it borders Reverchon Park in Dallas. When completed over the next few years, Katy Trail will have a , concrete path for bicyclists and in-line skaters, an adjacent , soft-surface track for pedestrians, four major entrance plazas, ADA-compliant entrances, benches, landscaping, and drinking fountains for all users, including pets. It will be connected to the Trinity Strand Trail. The planting plan is dominated by native Texas trees and plants, including chinkapin and Lacey oaks, perennial grasses, Flame Acanthus, and numerous species of native salvias and other plans which support water conservation. For years, the abandoned railroad tracks had been populated by the homeless, drug dealers, and gangs. The master plan includes strategies to transform negative public perceptions of the Katy Trail through landscaping, lighting, and particularly in the design of nine public spaces at important crossings and intersections. For night-time safety without adding light pollution, reflective shield lamps atop poles direct light onto the trail. The public spaces have more intimate lighting and distinctive light fixtures.

Short stature may be the result of a growth pattern inherited from a parent (familial) or occur for no apparent reason (idiopathic). Typically at some point during childhood, growth slows down, eventually resuming at a normal rate. CDGP is the most common cause of short stature and delayed puberty. Background Children with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP), the most common cause of short stature and pubertal delay in males, typically have slowed linear growth within the first 3 years of life. In this variant of normal growth, linear growth velocity and weight gain slows beginning as young as age 3‚Äì6 months, resulting in downward crossing of growth percentiles, which often continues until age 2‚Äì3 years. At that time, growth resumes at a normal rate, and these children grow either along the lower growth percentiles or beneath the curve but parallel to it for the remainder of the prepubertal years. At the expected time of puberty, the height of children with CDGP begins to drift further from the growth curve because of delay in the onset of the pubertal growth spurt. Catch-up growth, onset of puberty, and pubertal growth spurt occur later than average, resulting in normal adult stature and sexual development. Although CDGP is a variant of normal growth rather than a disorder, delays in growth and sexual development may contribute to psychological difficulties, warranting treatment for some individuals. Recent studies have suggested that referral bias is largely responsible for the impression that normal short stature per se is a cause of psycho-social problems; non-referred children with short stature do not differ from those with more normal stature in school performance or socialization. Causes CDGP is thought to be inherited from multiple genes from both parents. The strong role of heredity is reflected in the 60-90% likelihood of this growth pattern in a family member of the same or opposite sex. A delay in the reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary pulse generator results in a later onset of puberty. Pathophysiology CDGP is a global delay in development that affects every organ system. Delays in growth and sexual development are quantified by skeletal age, which is determined from bone age radio-graphic studies of the left hand and wrist. Growth and development are appropriate for an individual's biologic age (skeletal age) rather than for their chronological age. Timing and tempo of growth and development are delayed in accordance with the biologic state of maturity. Approximately 15% of patients with short stature referred for endocrinologic evaluation have CDGP. Individuals with CDGP and familial short stature represent another 23%. The frequency of CDGP may be underestimated because individuals with milder delays and those who are not psychologically stressed may not be seen by subspecialists. In a study of 555 (out of 80,000) schoolchildren below the third percentile in height for age with growth rates below normal (<5 cm/y), twice as many boys as girls were affected. CDGP was found in 28% of boys and 24% of girls, and another 18% of boys and 16% of girls had familial short stature in combination with CDGP. Diagnosis Physical examination findings in patients with CDGP are essentially normal, with the exception of immature appearance for age. Body proportions may reflect the delay in growth. During childhood, the upper-to-lower body ratio may be greater than normal, reflecting more infantile proportions. In adults, the ratio is often reduced (i.e., <1 in whites, <0.9 in blacks) as a result of the longer period of leg (long bone) growth. Frequency Although the epidemiologic data indicate that all variants of normal growth are twice as common in boys as in girls, referrals for short stature reflect an even more divergent sex ratio. This likely reflects greater concern about males who are shorter than their peers or who have delayed sexual development. No racial bias has been identified. Patterns of growth consistent with CDGP occur in infants as young as 3‚Äì6 months. However, individuals often do not seek medical attention until puberty, when lack of sexual development becomes a concern and discrepancy in height from peers is magnified by the delay in pubertal growth spurt.

He did play a number of minor matches on the 1911‚Äì12 Ashes tour and was considered many times between 1901 and 1905 for a place against Australia.  Biography  Born 5 March 1876, Norton, Yorkshire, England, Iremonger played 334 first- class matches for Nottinghamshire between 1899 and 1914, scoring 16,622 runs at 35.06 and taking 619 wickets with his right-arm medium-pace at 22.98. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1903. Iremonger had had a trial in the then-annual \\"Colts\\" match (whereby a team of twenty potential first-class cricketers played an odds match against the senior Nottinghamshire team) in 1897. It was though he had the potential to strengthen Nottinghamshire's dreadfully weak bowling, so that the county engaged him as a bowler in 1899 and he played in five matches for the first eleven. However, he took only five wickets and never more than one in an innings. It was thought he had the accuracy and the strong physique at over to succeed but lacked any spin whatsoever and thus could never beat even ordinary batsmen. However, the following year his solid defence saw Iremonger establish himself in the first team as a batsman, but he was routinely criticised for lacking strokes and his figures with an average of only around 18 bore this out. It was thus a surprise when Iremonger jumped in the rank of batsmen in August 1901 with four centuries in successive matches and an average of 44. For the following five years, Iremonger was one of the best batsmen in England, forming with Arthur Jones one of the best opening partnerships in the game. His exceptionally strong and watchful defence made him a very hard man to get out and he had developed a good range of strokes on the off-side ‚Äì though his rather stiff style made him less than graceful to most spectators watching him. This first stage of Iremonger's career reached its peak in 1904 when he made 1,983 runs with an average above 60, including his highest score of 272 against Kent.\\"Bygones\\". Nottingham Evening Post. p. 33. 2 May 2008 1907, despite Nottinghamshire winning the Championship, saw Iremonger decline badly as a batsman. He achieved a batting average of above 30 only once in the seven seasons from 1907 to 1913 and dropped down the order from 1910. Nevertheless, Iremonger always remained an extremely useful and obdurate bat in any crisis, and even in the wet summer of 1912 where he only once exceeded fifty, eight not outs gave him an average of 26. However, from 1908, with John Gunn and Hallam declining rapidly as bowlers, Iremonger surprisingly filled the breach in the county's attack. Although he had not infrequently been tried as a change bowler, Iremonger did not take five wickets in an innings until 1908, yet at the end of that year he had taken 57 wickets and headed the Nottinghamshire bowling averages. By 1910 his developing break-back and accuracy of length made him deadly on a worn or sticky wicket. The exceptional summer of 1911, though it was thought batsmen \\"did not find him difficult\\",Wisden Cricketer's Almanack, 1912 saw Iremonger's nagging perseverance on the hardest of pitches rated so highly that he was taken to Australia for bowling alone. He did little and was never considered for the 1912 Triangular Tournament despite maintaining his form. His last season of 1914 saw Iremonger frequently captain Nottinghamshire in the absence of any available amateur to carry out the job, and he regained some of the batting form of ten years before. His most notable feat, however, was bowling 66 consecutive overs unchanged against Hampshire at Southampton. This is an all- time record for most overs bowled by any bowler unchanged. When county cricket resumed after the war, Iremonger did not resume his first-class career, but he did play one match for Notts' Second XI in 1927, when he was 51 years old. He coached Nottinghamshire from 1921 to 1938, when he retired.Wisden 1957, p. 945. Iremonger lived to the age of 80, and was living in Nottingham at the time of his death on 25 March 1956. James also played football for Nottingham Forest making his debut as a fullback in 1896 against Stoke and earned 2 caps for England. He spent fifteen years with Forest making over 300 appearances. James's brother Albert Iremonger, the Notts County goalkeeper, also played first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire. His other brother, Harry, also played football for Nottingham Forest.

The band was initially conceived as a forum for the three to compose pop songs while awaiting the reformation of their previous band, Pablo's Triangle. As the weeks passed the reformation looked unlikely. With a large catalog of songs already taking shape by early 2002, Head of Femur began to recruit musicians to flesh out the lineup for live performance. The nature of the music demanded more than the traditional rock band instrumentation, so strings, trumpet, and orchestral percussion were added along with drums and bass guitar. Head of Femur played their first show at a small club in Chicago in March 2002. They made plans to record a demo with local producer Jim Bentley and perform at Chicago's The Empty Bottle. On the strength of that demo, Portland's Greyday Productions signed Head of Femur in November 2002. Recording sessions for the band's debut album, Ringodom or Proctor, took place in March 2003. Ten of Ringodom's eleven songs were among the first of the dozens composed by Elsener, Armstrong and Focht, and had been intended to comprise the first record since their inception. The album was recorded at Lincoln, Nebraska's Presto! Recording Studios with A. J. Mogis. Following more than a year of touring as an 8-piece (2 guitars, trumpet, trombone, violin, drums, keys, 4 vocals and percussion) with such acts as Bright Eyes and Rilo Kiley, as well as outings on their own, Head of Femur signed with Brooklyn's spinART Records in the summer of 2004. In August 2004, Head of Femur set about recording their next full-length record. Hysterical Stars was recorded at Wall To Wall in Chicago with engineers Chris Brickley and Dan Dietrich and released in late May 2005. Head Of Femur spent 2005 touring with Architecture in Helsinki, Wilco, Dr. Dog, The Spinto Band, The Bruces, Andrew Bird, Matt Pond PA and headlining tours themselves. They were the first band on the first Intonation Music Festival and performed at the Wicker Park Festival, CMJ and SXSW. During a short break from touring in the Fall of 2005, the group laid down four tracks mostly live at Truckstop Studios in Chicago. The recordings showcased a more band-oriented sound as opposed to the multi-tracked orchestra captured on their first two albums. The songs, including covers from The Band and Neil Young and Crazy Horse were released in late 2005 as an iTunes exclusive EP. Head Of Femur finished up the year by stripping the lineup down to a more traditional five-piece lineup of the core trio plus Nick \\"The Chancellor\\" Westra on bass/vocals and Tyson Thurston on keys. This lineup played two shows on New Year's Eve in Chicago. May 2007, Head of Femur had completed work on their third full-length, \\"Great Plains\\", due to be released March 25, 2008. After many members moved back to their home state of Nebraska in 2013, they were approached by Mike Semrad, owner of Sower Records, in early 2016 wanting to release a new record. Members had been working with Matt Focht, via the internet, working out tunes and being creative. After numerous sessions in Lincoln at Circle M Studios, 'Hear! Hear! Tunemaker' was finally completed in the Fall of 2016. The new vinyl record is set to be released February 2017 at the historic Pla Mor Ballroom.

This is an important event in Ayyavazhi mythology tells us about the happenings that took place when Lord Vaikundar was thrown before a three-days-starving tiger. As per the order of the king of Thiruvithankur (Kalineesan), a commander summoned his soldiers and ordered them to fetch a tiger. They were threatened to be hanged if they failed in bringing a tiger. The soldiers, being terrified, implored Vaikundar to help them get a tiger. Lord Vaikundar, knowing their predicament, enabled them to get hold of a tiger. The soldiers, acknowledging and praising the divine powers of Vaikundar, returned to the prison with the tiger. The tiger was put in a cage for a few days without any food. On a particular day, in the presence of ministers, administrators, and different sections of the army Vaikundar was thrown into the tiger's cage. What a miracle it was! The tiger, knowing its creator, did not jump on the prey, but lay there unmoved. The soldiers, being vexed at the strange behaviour of the ferocious animal, tried to provoke it. One of the soldiers used the back of a long spear to prod the animal to action. It so happened that the tiger caught hold of the spear tightly, and, the soldier, trying to extricate the spear, pulled it out vehemently. Quite unexpectedly, the tiger left the spear and, alas, the sharp point of the spear pierced through a priest who was standing among the spectators and killed him. Hearing the alarming news, fear gripped the king. He lamented saying: \\"killing a priest will invite a curse more severe than that of killing a thousand cows\\".He immediately withdrew his soldiers from torturing Vaikundar. On the other hand, devotees of Vaikuntar were enthralled, and their faith increased. They spread this news to one and all in every direction.(see: Ayyavazhi mythology) References * Arisundara Mani (2002), Akilathirattu Ammanai Parayana Urai, 2002 Vaikundar Thirukkudumbam Publications. * G.

McCarthy that he had a list of individuals who were known by the Secretary of State to be members of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) yet who were still working in the State Department.Government papers about this hearing The mandate of the committee was to conduct \\"a full and complete study and investigation as to whether persons who are disloyal to the United States are, or have been, employed by the Department of State.\\" Congressional Record, 81st Congress, 2nd session, pp 2062-2068; quoted in: The chairman of the subcommittee was Senator Millard Tydings, a Democrat from Maryland. Senator Millard Tydings On February 20, 1950, McCarthy had delivered a 5-hour speech to the Senate in which he presented the cases of 81 \\"loyalty risks\\" who he claimed were working for the State Department. McCarthy declined requests to disclose the actual names of the people on his list, and instead referred to them by \\"case numbers\\". It is widely accepted that most of McCarthy's cases were taken from the so-called \\"Lee list\\"‚Äîa report that had been compiled three years earlier for the House Appropriations Committee. Led by former FBI agent Robert E. Lee, the House investigators had been allowed to review the security clearance documents on State Department employees, and had determined that there were \\"incidents of inefficiencies\\" in the security reviews of 108 past and present employees. The Lee list was also the source of McCarthy's famous list of 57 \\"cardcarrying Communists\\" in the State Department. In 1948, the State Department had informed the House that of the 108 cases flagged by Lee, 57 were still working for the department. This list included persons whom Lee had deemed security risks for a variety of reasons, such as marital infidelity or drunkenness, and all of them had been cleared by the State Department's review process. In response to these allegations, the Tydings Committee hearings were held, opening on March 8, 1950 and lasting until July 17. At the hearings, McCarthy expanded on his original list of unnamed individuals and made charges against nine others whose names he made public: Dorothy Kenyon, Esther Brunauer, Haldore Hanson, Gustavo Duran, Owen Lattimore, Harlow Shapley, Frederick L. Schuman, John S. Service and Philip Jessup. Owen Lattimore became a particular focus of McCarthy's, who at one point described him as a \\"top Russian spy.\\" From its beginning, the Tydings Committee was marked by partisan infighting. Its final report, written by the Democratic majority, concluded that the individuals on McCarthy's list were neither Communists nor pro-communist, and said the State Department had an effective security program. Tydings labeled McCarthy's charges a \\"fraud and a hoax,\\" and said that the result of McCarthy's actions was to \\"confuse and divide the American people[...] to a degree far beyond the hopes of the Communists themselves.\\" Republicans responded in kind, with William Jenner stating that Tydings was guilty of \\"the most brazen whitewash of treasonable conspiracy in our history.\\" The full Senate voted three times on whether to accept the report, and each time the voting was precisely divided along party lines.

Led by singer/guitarist and former Eddie Boy Band member, Mark Goldenberg (who also wrote the bulk of The Cretones' material), the group had a strong sense of melody and a lyrical wit that placed them a cut above most of their new wave peers. Other members were Peter Bernstein (bass, vocals), Steve Beers (percussion), and Steve Leonard (keyboards, vocals). Both their albums were released on Richard Perry's Planet Records label. On the Billboard Hot 100, the group's one charted song, \\"Real Love,\\" peaked at no. 79 in June 1980; it was from their first album, Thin Red Line. The song \\"Empty Heart\\", from their second album Snap Snap, was their only other song to receive significant airplay on album rock stations, but it did not chart as a single. They are perhaps best known as the band that provided three of the songs on Linda Ronstadt's Platinum-selling 1980 new wave rock album, Mad Love. Ronstadt's enormous success served to introduce and highlight Goldenberg's aggressive compositions. After the band broke up, Goldenberg went on to write the song \\"Automatic\\" for the Pointer Sisters, which was a top 10 hit in 1984. He later toured with artists such as Peter Frampton and Chris Isaak and had moderate success as a new-age instrumental artist in Japan. Since 1994, he has been lead guitarist for Jackson Browne and continues to write, play, and produce. Cretones members Steve Beers and Peter Bernstein helped produce and compose the score to the TV show 21 Jump Street. Beers has been producing television ever since, while Bernstein has gone on to write numerous film and TV scores. Discography *Thin Red Line (1980) *Snap! Snap!

He served as governor of the convict settlement at Norfolk Island from 6 August 1846 to 18 January 1853, and later as the inspector-general of penal establishments in Victoria, during which he was \\"stoned to death\\" by angry prisoners.CJ Coventry, \\"Links in the Chain: British slavery, Victoria and South Australia\\" Before/Now 1(1) (2019), 34, https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:23672/datastreams/CONTENT/content Price had aristocratic connections which aided him in securing the position. Although he was initially seen as restoring order after an incompetent predecessor, Price scoffed at the idea of rehabilitation for convicts. An enthusiasm for flogging for trivial breaches of discipline and extreme corporal punishments of his own devising led to his regime being denounced. He left to farm, but was given responsibility for another prison in which his strongly punitive measures provoked a violent reaction. Early life Price was born in Trengwainton, Cornwall, to a slaveholding family.Coventry, \\"Links in the Chain,\\" 34.The Australian Encyclopaedia, Grolier He was the fourth son of Sir Rose Price, first baronet, by Elizabeth his wife, daughter of Charles Lambart and sister of Frances, wife of the second Earl Talbot. Price studied at Charterhouse and Brasenose College, Oxford without taking a degree, and arrived in Hobart, Van Diemen's Land in May 1836 with letters of introduction from influential relatives. There he farmed in the Huon River district and married Mary, the eldest daughter of James Franklin and ward of Sir John Franklin, lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land from 1836 to 1843. Career In 1839 Price was appointed muster master of convicts and stipendiary magistrate. In 1846 he suffered an unknown illness and was recommended by Surgeon Bedford to take leave of absence 'or else he will be laid up seriously'. However, he was appointed commandant of Norfolk Island in July of that year, to replace Major Joseph Childs. One of Price's first duties was to arrange for the trial of 26 convicts alleged to have been involved in murders during the Cooking pot uprising of July 1846 at the end of Childs' administration. Twelve convicts were hanged in October, and five others shortly after. The executions broke the power of the feared 'Ring' clique of inmates. Price was a tall burly man who affected an extravagant style of dress and used underworld slang. He openly announced his intention was to break the inmates and went among them with few guards to emphasise his dominance, although he also carried two pepper-box pistols. Prices's ability to speak the argot of the criminal underworld made a deep impression on convicts and some thought he must have actually been imprisoned himself. A critic, Reverend Thomas Rogers, said that he would disguise himself as a constable and move around Hobart, seeking disorderly characters. Hazzard claims that \\"he seemed to know, with terrifying accuracy, the way a criminal's mind worked, and this, coupled with his merciless administering of the Law, gave him an almost hypnotic power over them\\". Another suggestion was that Price, who had an extremely close relationship with a convict overseer, was homosexual and had gained his knowledge and flashy dress sense from moving in the covert rough trade gay scene during his earlier life in England. Backed by Governor Denison, Price was answerable to no one but himself and he invented a series of punishments to cow his wards. Routine work cutting coral was done while chained to 36lb weights. Inmates were subject to flogging for the slightest infraction, and putting balm on a flogged man's wounds became an offence. His innovative corporal punishments included much use of restraints such as a cage over the head with a prong that immobilised the tongue and made breathing difficult, or an all encompassing steel frame that men were kept in for more than a week. By 1852 public disquiet caused Denison to privately remonstrate with Price. Hughes' claims that, in Hobart \\"the suspicion that the commandant was out of control, that the island's remoteness from Hobart had permitted some cancer of his soul to metastasise wildly, could not entirely be allayed\\". He hints at a connection between Price's unspecified illness in 1846, and \\"the morbid ferocities of his rule\\". Price \\"ruled by terror, informers and the lash\\" according to one modern writer, a contemporary historian noted the \\"merciless exercise of his authority\\". Bishop Robert Willson, following his third visit to the island in 1852, described the harsh punishment of the convicts. He observed \\"the state of the yard, from the blood running down men's backs, mingled with the water used in washing them when taken down from the triangle ‚Äì the degrading scene of a large number of men ‚Ä¶ waiting their turn to be tortured, and the more humiliating spectacle presented by those who had undergone the scourging ‚Ä¶ were painful to listen to\\". When Willson asked Price to explain the increased use of corporal punishment, the commandant \\"defended his use of flogging, to which he professed great aversion, as necessary to enforce obedience to regulations, especially those controlling the use of tobacco\\". Price returned to Hobart in January 1853 as the British government intended to abandon Norfolk Island. He was appointed inspector- general of prisons in Victoria in January 1854, to deal with the problem of crime arising from the gold rushes in that colony. Death On 26 March 1857, he visited prison hulk convicts living under his regieme employed at Williamstown. Accompanied by a small number of guards Price went toward the men but his party was quickly surrounded by about a hundred inmates. Almost immediately his guards broke and ran after a barrage of rocks. Price also tried to escape but he was knocked down and severely battered with the iron bars and hammers of the workers.. He died next day, and following the inquest, fifteen convicts were tried for murder, seven being hanged. The seven convicts were Thomas Williams, Henry Smith (alias Brennan) & Thomas Moloney were hanged on the 28 April 1857, Francis Brannigan, William Brown & Richard Bryant hanged on the 29 April 1857, and John Chisley hanged on the 30 April 1857. After his death Price has, in Hughes' opinion \\"remained one of the durable ogres of the Australian imagination\\", featuring in Price Warung's tales and as the basis for the cruel commandant Maurice Frere in Marcus Clarke's For the Term of his Natural Life (1885). Hazzard calls him \\"a rock of a man against whom some might lean with confidence; others he might crush without pity\\", while his biographer concludes that \\"he was a man of great personal strength and considerable courage, and was capable of sentimental as well as merciless deeds\\".

The hi-top was a trend symbolising the golden age of hip hop and urban contemporary music during the 1980s and the early 1990s. It was common among young black people between 1986 and 1992 and to a lesser extent in the mid‚Äì1990s (1993‚Äì1996). The hi-top fade is commonly called a Crew cut, due to the great likeness of the two styles. In fact, the hi-top fade could qualify as a variation on the Flattop. The crew cut shows graduation of the top hair shorter from the front hairline to the crown. Origin In 1980 Grace Jones and then boyfriend Jean-Paul Goude collaborated on the cover and artwork for Warm Leatherette. It featured her signature flattop/hi-top hair. In the hip hop community throughout the mid-1980s, young African Americans leaned towards Jheri curls or simple haircuts without tapers or fades of any sort. In 1986, rappers like Schoolly D and Doug E. Fresh had the first, somewhat developed, styles of the hi-top fade in hip hop. However, their hairstyles lacked the geometric precision that characterized the more modern hi-top fade styles. In the hip-hop community, one of the first public appearances of the more modern hi-top fade hairstyles was in the \\"Tramp\\" video by Salt-N-Pepa, released early in 1987. In this video, the dancers could be seen with this hairstyle. They can be also seen dancing in a new jack swing style form based on their wardrobe and choreography, which was not seen in other hip hop and R&B; videos at the time. In the mid- to late 1980s the haircut was often credited to Larry Blackmon the lead singer of the band Cameo. Blackmon had a hairstyle in the mid 1980s that was the forerunner to the hi-top Fade, with the tall square flat top but with slightly longer sides and back. There are numerous examples of rappers referring to the hairstyle as a \\"cameo cut\\" between 1987 and 1990, the most notable being in the Ultramagnetic MCs song \\"Give The Drummer Some\\" from 1988 where Ced Gee, who had a hi-top fade at the time, says \\"... 'cause I'm a real pro, with a cameo, and not an afro\\". Growth in popularity By 1986, many young African American people, especially in the New York City, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia areas, began to follow the hi-top fade trend. At this time, hi- top fades became more geometrically defined, becoming more massive and 'higher' along with differences in shape as well as more designs. More music videos released from the fall of 1987 to the spring of 1988, such as \\"I Don't Care\\" by Audio Two (1988),\\"2 Hype\\" by Kid 'N Play (1988), \\"Move the Crowd\\" by Eric B. & Rakim (1987) (a few extras could be seen wearing one), \\"Paper Thin\\" by MC Lyte (1988), \\"Rising to the Top\\" by Doug E. Fresh (1988), \\"Do This My Way\\" by Kid 'N Play (1988), and \\"Ain't No Half Steppin'\\" by Big Daddy Kane (1988), shows examples of early trends of the more developed hi-top fade. In EPMD's \\"You Gots To Chill\\" several dancers and the DJ can be seen sporting Hi top fades in the music video. Different substyles emerged around the same time such as the \\"gumby\\" (slanted hi-top that had a shape similar to the Gumby cartoon character) or reagan (similar to the gumby but with more 'parts' and designs). Many of the teenage castmembers on the films Lean On Me (1989) with Morgan Freeman and Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing (1989) could be seen wearing these Gumby-shaped hairstyles. Recording artists such as Bobby Brown, TKA and Coro also wore the hi-top fade. From late 1988 to 1989, the hi-top fade was the symbol of the rap culture at the time. Rappers such as Kid 'N Play, Big Daddy Kane and Kwam√© were internationally famous for helping promote this trend worldwide, particularly Kid 'N Play member Christopher \\"Kid\\" Reid. In late 1988, hi-top fades even became more developed, more hip-hoppers and people outside the New York area began following this trend. This hairstyle also helped define the new jack swing movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The video \\"Fight the Power\\" by Public Enemy, which was shot in April 1989, shows how much the trend set across the world and was highly symbolic of urban style at the time. Rapper and actor Will Smith sported a hi-top fade during the production of the popular sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, even referencing the hairstyle in a first season episode of the show. Changing trends The conventional hi-top began to fall out of fashion in the early 1990s and was changed by revolutionary RnB groups like Jodeci, who added slits and unique designs that are still imitated till this day. This style became the staple design set by the group who were the self-imposed \\"bad boys of RnB\\". The turning point was between 1995 and 1997 many people who had sported the hi-top fade started to move toward other men's styles. Still, the hi-top remained common among many groups of young adults and teenagers for a few years longer. As for the braided style of hi-top fades, it characterized an era of 'afrocentricity' of hip hop and embracing the rap culture. Golden age MCs like Def Jef and the hip hop group De La Soul are known for their braided hi-top fade styles in 1989 and 1990. Many back-up dancers in many hip hop, dance, and R&B; videos could be seen wearing similar hairstyles from 1990 to 1992. This trend continued until 1994 when urban hair style simplified into low-cut fade hair cuts and cornrow hairstyles. This hairstyle was also a fashion trend of new jack swing era. Modern hi-top fades Nerlens Noel, a basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA) The style began to slowly reemerge in popularity in the early to late 2000s, as a new generation of black musicians, athletes, and actors began to embrace this hairstyle. A prominent example is former Cleveland Cavaliers guard/forward Iman Shumpert. The hairstyle even surfaced again in 2012 with the late 1980s‚Äìearly 1990s style returning. NBA players such as Nerlens Noel, and Norris Cole have sported hi-top fades. The hi-top has made an appearance in the UK since the late 1980s. The hairstyle also received some airtime during the second inauguration of Barack Obama, as sported by Barack and Michelle Obama's nephew Avery Robinson.

Early Today is an American early morning news broadcasting that is broadcast on NBC. The program features general national and international news stories, financial and entertainment news, off-beat stories, national weather forecasts and sports highlights. , it is anchored by Frances Rivera and Phillip Mena. Overview Early Today is the only early morning network newscast on any of the Big Three television networks (NBC, ABC or CBS) that is not produced jointly with an overnight news program (NBC has not aired an overnight newscast since the 1998 cancellation of NBC Nightside, which aired alongside Early Today during the latter program's first few months). As of 2019, the program broadcasts three unique half hour shows at 3:00, 3:30 and 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time and is then tape delayed in a continuous half-hour loop until 8:00 a.m. Eastern (the show produces an additional half hour live at 6:30 a.m). Subsequently on September 11, NBC discontinued same-date reruns of CNBC's Mad Money from its late night schedule in order to accommodate the earlier live broadcast (before that date, Early Today was first broadcast live at 4:00 a.m. ET). As a result, some NBC affiliates that did not choose to fill the time period formerly occupied by the Mad Money replays with syndicated programs or infomercial following the change now air Early Today in the form of two separate editions or as a 90-minute to 2¬Ω-hour loop ‚Äì in which case, the program competes against ABC's World News Now and the CBS Overnight News, effectively resulting in Early Today acting as NBC's de facto overnight network newscast, especially west of the boundary of the Central Time Zone. It usually airs as a lead-in to local morning newscasts on most NBC stations, although in the few markets where a morning newscast is not produced by the station, it may air in a two- to three-hour loop immediately before the start of Today. The show may updated for any breaking news occurring before 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time, after which time any live breaking news requiring network- level coverage, at the station's local discretion in each time zone or network orders for live coverage, is under full oversight of Today and their staffers. Early Today and First Look are traditionally pre-empted during the Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games to allow the airing of overnight replays of NBC's primetime Olympic event coverage and live coverage on the NBC broadcast network and MSNBC, along with allowing stations to fulfill syndicated programming requirements where a distributor requires their programs to still air in some form with the open slot, albeit during the overnights. History =Origins= The program's logo during its CNBC- produced run. Early Today premiered on September 9, 1999 as a replacement for NBC News at Sunrise, which NBC decided to cancel in April 1999 as part of a major shakeup of the network's daytime and early morning schedules (these changes included the launch of another Today-branded program, the short-lived talk show Later Today, as well as the cancellation of the long-running soap opera Another World). The Early Today title had previously been used for another early morning news program produced by NBC News from 1982 to 1983 (and was replaced by NBC News at Sunrise following its cancellation), which featured the hosts of NBC's Today at the time ‚Äì Jane Pauley, Bryant Gumbel and Willard Scott. Originally produced from the former Fort Lee, New Jersey facilities of NBC's sister financial news cable network, CNBC, and focusing on business and financial news (including a modified version of the CNBC Ticker that showed stock prices and weather forecasts for select U.S. cities), the program switched to a general news format in 2004. As part of this reformatting, production of the program was relocated to the Secaucus, New Jersey headquarters of MSNBC. Concurrently, former Saturday Today anchor Amy Robach replaced the program's original anchor Nanette Hansen. =Present= MSNBC's First Look, which airs at 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time, is a repurposed version of the network newscast using the weathercasters and segments. Until 2013, the sports segment was produced from the Los Angeles studios of NBC owned-and-operated station KNBC, using either Fred Roggin or Mario Solis as anchors; the segment was recorded after that station's 11:00 p.m. Pacific Time Zone newscast for later airing and to account for most West Coast sports results, but was aired without any differences on both First Look and Early Today (the segment is now conducted live-to-tape during both programs from the newsroom at NBC Studios). Some segments seen on Early Today are excluded from First Look, mainly the local weather cut-in (which does not appear at all on many NBC stations that broadcast Early Today, showing only a list of forecasts for seven randomly selected U.S. cities) and a local event Barker featuring a promotion for an NBC affiliate serving the city where the event is being held (which was dropped from the NBC program in 2013), while a small number of stories seen on Early Today may not be seen on First Look. Some NBC affiliates do not air the entire program, and a purposeful sign-off is made by the show's anchor at the 24-minute mark in order to allow stations to air an early weather segment or start their morning newscast early, while NBC carries a non-essential human interest or light news story to end the telecast for stations that carry the entire program. Since NBC's corporate parent NBCUniversal acquired part-ownership of The Weather Channel in 2008, weather forecasts used on the program incorporate the channel's branding and forecasts, although Early Today uses repurposed graphics systems from the defunct digital subchannel weather network NBC Weather Plus, which provided forecasts for the program until it shut down in 2008. In September 2007, the program, as with the rest of MSNBC's operations, moved from the previous Secaucus, New Jersey headquarters to the network's combined news headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in the New York City borough of Manhattan, with MSNBC, in October 2007. MSNBC's master control facilities were relocated to the CNBC Headquarters at the NBC Universal Network Organization Center in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Until a revamp of the set used for both programs in 2011, the anchor background on Early Today was a video screen of a sunrise scene; a skycam shot of Manhattan was used for First Look. On June 29, 2009, concurrent with the launch of MSNBC, Early Today became the first early morning network newscast to begin broadcasting in high-definition television. The program had aired live at 4:30 a.m. Eastern Time until March 1, 2010, when the initial broadcast of the show was moved to 4:00 a.m. Eastern to allow stations in the Eastern Time Zone to begin their morning newscasts at 4:30 a.m. with an Early Today lead-out; previously without the new schedule in some cases, the NBC All Night repeat of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon would inexplicably lead into local news with five minutes cut off the former program if the default NBC schedule, in addition to one local half-hour program, was followed by an affiliate in the overnight hours. As of 2019, the show is now offered live as early as 3:00 a.m. Eastern. Further brand integration with Today came in December 2013, when Early Today introduced a new graphics package based on that used by the network's flagship morning show since August of that year, as well as a modified version of that program's \\"orange sunrise\\" logo. Notable on-air staff =Current on-air staff= Early Today is the only American early morning network newscast that features both an on-staff meteorologist and sports anchor; anchors of ABC's America This Morning act as weather presenters, and staff from ABC's sister cable network ESPN present sports.

It is named after the Ray√≥n brothers, who were insurgent heroes of the country's independence achieved in 1821. The town was founded in 1852. It is a small village consisting of fourteen streets, lying in the middle of the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range, in the northeast of Mexico. In the area near Rayones are the municipalities of Galeana (due south), Santiago (due north), and the state of Coahuila, due west. Rayones marks the beginning of the Zona Ixtlera, the southernmost region of the state of Nuevo Le√≥n. Access to Rayones is difficult. The main highway, coming from Montemorelos, is a challenge for most drivers. The unpaved highway coming from Galeana is even more risky, as it is a two-way road where only one vehicle fits; it is rocky, lined by a dangerous cliff and has no guard rail. Rayones, however, is a touristic delight for offroad enthusiasts who travel long distances from the state's capital, Monterrey, crossing the Pil√≥n river, the town's primary water source. Several lodging places surround the town, and the local hotel accommodates the convoys. The municipality has some interesting landmarks such as La Cebolla (the Onion), a hilltop with a pleasurable scenic overview. Extensive pecan tree plantations in the region bring prosperity to Rayones; pecans being the main product commercialized by locals. The traditional 'Feria de la Nuez' or Pecan Fair is held annually as a tourist attraction and a merchant exchange, with traditional dances and exhibitions also offered.

The documents achieved recognition in the US press nine months later, on 18 June 2005, when the Associated Press (AP) published full typed copies of all six papers on its website. The copies were provided by the British reporter, who said he had destroyed the original documents to protect his sources. An anonymous senior British official said the documents appeared authentic. Contents AP reported that the memos show: \\"When Prime Minister Tony Blair's chief foreign policy adviser dined with Condoleezza Rice six months after the 11 September attacks, the then-US national security adviser didn't want to discuss Osama bin Laden or al-Qaida. She wanted to talk about 'regime change' in Iraq, setting the stage for the U.S.-led invasion more than a year later.\\" British Foreign Office political director Peter Ricketts said in one of the memos. \\"For Iraq, 'regime change' does not stack up. It sounds like a grudge between Bush and Saddam,\\" Ricketts said. (See April 1993 for Saddam's attempted assassination of Bush's father.) The memos express concern about breaking international law, but Blair is shown as being determined to go to war as Bush's ally regardless. Tony Dodge, an Iraq expert at the University of London, said, \\"The documents show what official inquiries in Britain already have, that the case of weapons of mass destruction was based on thin intelligence and was used to inflate the evidence to the level of mendacity. In going to war with Bush, Blair defended the special relationship between the two countries, like other British leaders have. But he knew he was taking a huge political risk at home. He knew the war's legality was questionable and its unpopularity was never in doubt.\\" Dodge also said the memos show that Blair was aware that postwar instability in Iraq was likely. In one of the memos, David Manning, who was Blair's chief foreign policy adviser, reported on a meeting in Washington, D.C., with Rice; > It is clear that Bush is grateful for your [Blair's] support and has > registered that you are getting flak. I said that you would not budge in > your support for regime change but you had to manage a press, a Parliament > and a public opinion that was very different from anything in the States. > And you would not budge either in your insistence that, if we pursued regime > change, it must be very carefully done and produce the right result.

Renewed refusal by Saddam to accept unfettered inspections > would be a powerful argument. After a lunch with Paul Wolfowitz, Sir Christopher Meyer wrote a private letter to Manning: > On Iraq I opened by sticking very closely to the script that you used with > Condi Rice last week. We backed regime change, but the plan had to be clever > and failure was not an option... The US could go it alone if it wanted to. > But if it wanted to act with partners, there had to be a strategy for > building support for military action against Saddam. I then went through the > need to wrongfoot Saddam on the inspectors and the UN security council > resolutions and the critical importance of the Middle East peace plan.

His goal was to create an injury-free training method as well as an effective self-defense system in order to preserve the older Arnis systems. The term Modern Arnis was used by Remy Presas' younger brother Ernesto Presas to describe his style of Filipino martial arts; since 1999 Ernesto Presas has called his system Kombatan. It is derived principally from the traditional Presas family style of the Bolo (machete) and the stick- dueling art of Balintawak Eskrima, with influences from other Filipino and Japanese martial arts. Arnis is the Philippines' national martial art and sport, after President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed the Republic Act. No. 9850 in 2009. RA 9850 is a consolidation of House Bill No. 6516 authored by South Cotabato Rep. Arthur Pingoy Jr., and Senate Bill No. 1424 authored by Majority leader Juan Miguel Zubiri with the help of Richard Gialogo. RA 9850 is expected to help propagate arnis as a modern martial art/sport that can compete with popular non-Filipino arts, i.e. taekwondo, karate and judo. The Act mandates the Department of Education to include the sport as a Physical Education course. History Senior Grandmasters of Modern Arnis: GMs Samuel Bambit Dulay, Rene Tongson, Jerry Dela Cruz, Rodel Dagooc, Pepito Robas along with Peachie Baron Saguin of Kalis Ilustrisimo Remy Presas studied his family's system from an early age. He went on to study the Japanese systems of Shotokan Karate and Judo, achieving high rank in each; but he simultaneously studied a variety of other Filipino systems, most notably Venancio Bacon's Balintawak. Beginning with a small gymnasium in Bacolod in the 1950s, he attempted to spread the art to the local youth as both a cultural legacy and a form of physical development or sport. He taught the art at the University of Negros Occidental-Recoletos. His desire to reinvigorate interest in his country's traditional martial art grew over time, and he began making modifications and improvements to what he had learned. In 1969 he moved to Manila at the request of a government official, and formed the Modern Arnis Federation of the Philippines. He was assisted by individuals such as those who now are on the Modern Arnis Senior Masters Council: Rodel Dagooc, Jerry dela Cruz, Roland Dantes, Vicente Sanchez, Rene Tongson, and Cristino Vasquez. He continued to develop and spread his art, including via books, until political considerations forced him to relocate to North America.Wiley (2001) There he met Wally Jay, George Dillman, and other artists who influenced his development of the art of Modern Arnis. In particular, many locks from Small Circle Jujitsu were added to Modern Arnis. The art continued to grow and change, in technique and in emphasis, though it always retained a focus on the single stick and on general self-defense. Those who trained with Remy Presas in the United States in the 1970s and early 1980s experienced the art differently from those who began training in the late 1990s. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he traveled extensively for seminars - the principal form of instruction in the system was through weekend training camps held around the world but especially in the U.S. - and produced books and videos. During the 1990s Wally Jay, Remy Presas (Modern Arnis), and Jack Hogan (Kyusho Jitsu) traveled together throughout the United States and worldwide promulgating small-circle jujitsu. At that time many elements of Small Circle JuJitsu were well integrated into Modern Arnis. Grandmaster Vicente Sanchez with students at Rizal Park During this time he experimented with different forms of titles and leadership in the art. The International Modern Arnis Federation Philippines would come to be the lead Modern Arnis organization in the Philippines, and the Deutscher Arnis Verband of Germany would be the lead organization in Europe. In the United States, the International Modern Arnis Federation (IMAF) was the principal organization as far as certification was concerned, but the founder created a variety of titles that indicated some level of organizational or leadership authority in the art (as opposed to titles such as guro (\\"teacher\\") or Punong Guro (\\"Head teacher\\") that recognized teaching and/or technical ability). Most prominent among these titles were Datu, meaning a chieftain or leader, awarded in this order to Shishir Inocalla, Kelly Worden and Ric \\"Bong\\" Jornales (of Arnis Sikaran) (all in the 1980s), Dieter Knuettel (1996), Tim Hartman and David Hoffman (both in 2000); and Master of Tapi-Tapi, awarded to Jeff Delaney, Chuck Gauss, Jim Ladis, Gaby Roloff, Randi Schea, Ken Smith, and Brian Zawilinski. The Masters of Tapi-Tapi titles were created to provide leadership and steerage for the IMAF following Remy Presas' passing; the Datus were expected to take leadership roles that might see them move in different, and perhaps less conventional, directions. Through 2001, however, the art remained largely united under the founder. In the wake of the 2001 death of Remy Presas, there was a splintering of the remaining leadership of Modern Arnis. The IMAF, the organization of record for North American Modern Arnis practitioners, split into two subgroups, one headed by Randi Schea and one headed by Jeff Delaney; the remaining five Masters of Tapi-Tapi associated with the group led by Randi Schea. Remy Presas' son Remy P. Presas and his siblings formed a group following his father's death, and Tim Hartman and Dieter Knuettel increased the independence of their organizations (the WMAA and DAV, respectively). Other groups, such as that headed by Kelly Worden, had become independent well before the founder's death (and with his support). Dan Anderson formed another branch of the art which he calls \\"MA80 System Arnis/Eskrima\\" which adds influences from Balintawak Eskrima and Integrated Eskrima. In 2012 Randi Schea and Jim Ladis retired from the IMAF. In 2018, Brian Zawilinski, the senior- most Master of Tapi Tapi, resigned from the IMAF and operates independently worldwide. In many ways, the situation is analogous to what occurred in the Jeet Kune Do and American Kenpo communities following the deaths of their popular and charismatic founders. In particular, the question of how high- ranking arnisadors should test for higher rank has been settled by different organizations in different ways. In some cases this has caused controversy. The art is healthy and continues to attract students. Current practitioners of Modern Arnis or arts strongly influenced by Modern Arnis who are prominent include: Bambit Dulay, Rene Tongson, Tim Hartman, Chuck Gauss, Ken Smith, Brian Zawilinski, Dan Anderson, Bram Frank, Kelly Worden, Rodel Dagooc and Dieter Knuettel. Modern Arnis continues to be taught worldwide. Training Grandmaster Jerry Dela Cruz of Arnis Cruzada and Modern Arnis One of the characteristics of Filipino martial arts is the use of weapons from the very beginning of training and Modern Arnis is no exception. The primary weapon is the rattan stick, called a cane or baston (baton), which varies in size, but is usually about 28 inches (71 cm) in length. Both single and double stick techniques are taught, with an emphasis on the former; unarmed defenses against the stick and against bladed weapons (which the stick is sometimes taken to represent) are a part of the curriculum. It is said that, originally, the cane was considered sacred by practitioners (Arnisadores), and therefore an arnis practitioner was expected to hit his cane at the hand or forearm of his sparring partner and not at the latter's cane. This had the advantage of being the preferred method in actual combat, referred to as \\"defanging the snake\\", that is, making the opponent drop his weapon so that he is less of a threat. However, it discouraged many would-be practitioners who found this training too painful and injury-inducing. The result was that the Filipino martial arts became in danger of dying out; in most areas of the Philippines, Japanese martial arts such as Karate and Judo were much more popular than the indigenous systems. Remy Presas' modernization of the training method was intended to help preserve the Filipino martial arts. He taught the method of hitting cane-on-cane during practice, which attracted more newcomers to the art and allowed the art to be taught in the Philippines' school system. \\"Defanging the snake\\" remains a principle of Modern Arnis, however, and in practical application, one would typically strike the hand or arm. The technique can be used empty-handed, where it is known as \\"limb destruction\\". Training covers empty-hand self-defense (striking, locking, throwing, etc.) as well as the trademark single and double stick techniques of the Filipino martial arts. Other aspects of the art include espada y daga (sword and dagger fighting), sinawali (double stick weaving patterns), and tapi-tapi (locking drills with the stick). In addition to partner drills, Modern Arnis includes the use of anyo (kata), solo forms both with and without the stick. Emphasis is placed on fitting the art in with a student's previous training (\\"the art within your art\\"), smoothly reacting to changing situations in the fight (\\"the flow\\"), and countering the opponent's attempt to counter strikes directed at him (\\"tapi-tapi\\"). Practitioners are called arnisadors or Modern Arnis players. In addition to its Filipino influences, elements of Judo, Shotokan Karate, and Wally Jay's Small Circle Jujutsu appear in the system.Wiley (2001) pp. 12-19 Belt ranks Grandmaster Pepito Robas of Otsotiros Baston Arnis System and Modern Arnis Modern Arnis uses a ranking system similar to the Dan ranks used in Karate and other Japanese systems. There are some minor variations between organizations as to the exact number of belts. There are 10 or 11 black belt ranks in Modern Arnis, depending on the organization. They are numbered in Tagalog: #Isa (pronounced as i-sah; which literally means \\"one\\") #Dalawa (pronounced dah-la-wah; literally \\"two\\") #Tatlo (pronounced as tat-loh; literally \\"three\\") #Apat (pronounced as Ah-pat; literally \\"four\\") #Lima (pronounced as li-mah;literally \\"five\\") #Anim (pronounced as ah-neem; literally \\"six\\") #Pito (pronounced as pi-toh; literally \\"seven\\") #Walo (pronounced as \\"wah-loh\\"; literally \\"eight\\") #Siyam (pronounced as si-yam or shahm; literally \\"nine\\") #Sampu (pronounced as sam-pu; literally \\"ten\\") Many groups use a \\"zero-degree\\" black belt rank as a probationary stage that comes before Isa. The actual name of the ranks is gender-specific. For men the rank is referred to as Lakan (Tagalog for nobleman) while for women it is referred to as Dayang (Tagalog for lady). Thus, a first degree black belt in Modern Arnis would be referred to as either a Lakan Isa or a Dayang Isa, depending on his or her gender. The \\"zero-degree\\" rank, if used, is referred to as simply Lakan or Dayang. The black belt is traditionally bordered with red; however, some groups use a plain black belt.Paman (2007) p. 38 In addition to rank, titles such as Datu, Commissioner, Master of Tapi-Tapi, Senior Master, Punong Guro, etc., have occasionally been granted to certain high-ranking individuals. The title Guro is typically given to all Lakans and Dayangs. Organizations Modern Arnis is perpetuated worldwide and some of the countries where the art is most popular are the Philippines, the United States, Canada, and Germany, but there are practitioners in many other nations as well. There are numerous organizations that continue to spread the art of Modern Arnis, to include (in no particular order) IMAFP (Philippines), DAV (Germany), WMAA (New York state), IMAF (Illinois), CSSD/SC (Florida), MA-80 (Oregon), NSI (Washington State) and TAWA (Connecticut).

Biography He was born in London in 1703 to aristocratic Huguenot French parents in the court of Queen Anne. While serving as a sailor during his adolescent years, de Benneville traveled around the world and began to question his religion and compare it to other world religions. He shed his Huguenot religion, developed his own ideas about Christianity, and became a preacher while still in his teens. De Benneville had a mystical experience and later a near death experience which he described in The Life and Trance of Dr. George De Benneville. These experiences convinced him that Hell is for purification, not punishment, and that, ultimately, all will be united with God. He believed that God is absolutely good and in his love would never condemn any human to eternal damnation. He also preached that each human being has a dualistic nature; the outer, flesh-and-blood person is subject to the evils of the world and may choose to do good or to do wrong, while the inner, spiritlike person is crafted by God and is perfect, immaculate, and holy, and cannot be damned. Therefore, all human beings experience salvation. Religious authorities in several nations were disturbed by evangelists such as de Benneville, and he was sentenced to death more than once. He preached and practiced medicine in France and Germany. After completing medical training in Europe, de Benneville immigrated to the American colonies during the mid-eighteenth century with others seeking religious tolerance. He settled in Pennsylvania and worked as a physician and apothecary in Oley, Berks County, using free time to continue his Universalist preaching. de Benneville socialized and traded herbal preparations with Native American groups in the area. His beliefs stressed that all people everywhere are loved by God, and cultures, races, and sexes have no bearing on the worth of a human being. His beliefs stated clearly that the physical body is merely one part of a person. George de Benneville died at home in Pennsylvania in 1793.

Early life Matthiessen was born in New York City to Erard Adolph Matthiessen (1902-2000)https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/23/nyregion/erard- matthiessen-97-new-york-architect.htmlhttps://www.legacy.com/obituaries/news- press/obituary.aspx?n=erard-a-matthiessen&pid;=18663393 and Elizabeth (n√©e Carey). Erard, an architect, joined the Navy during World War II and helped design gunnery training devices. Later, he gave up architecture to become a spokesman and fundraiser for the Audubon Society and the Nature Conservancy. The well-to-do family lived in both New York City and Connecticut where, along with his brother, Matthiessen developed a love of animals that influenced his future work as a wildlife writer and naturalist. He attended St. Bernard's School, the Hotchkiss School, and ‚Äî after briefly serving in the U.S. Navy (1945‚Äì47) ‚Äì Yale University (B.A., 1950), with his junior year spent at the Sorbonne. At Yale, he majored in English, published short stories (one of which won the prestigious Atlantic Prize), and studied zoology. =Paris Review and CIA= Marrying and resolving to undertake a writer's career, he soon moved back to Paris, where he associated with other expatriate American writers such as William Styron, James Baldwin and Irwin Shaw. There, in 1953, he became one of the founders, along with Harold L. Humes, Thomas Guinzburg, Donald Hall, and George Plimpton, of the literary magazine The Paris Review. As revealed in a 2006 film, he was working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) at the time, using the Review as his cover. In a 2008 interview with Charlie Rose, Matthiessen stated that he \\"invented The Paris Review as cover\\" for his CIA activities. He completed his novel Partisans while employed by the CIA.Frances Stonor Saunders, Who Paid the Piper?: CIA and the Cultural Cold War, 1999, Granta, ; p. 246. (USA: The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters, 2000, The New Press, ) He returned to the U.S. in 1954, leaving Plimpton (a childhood friend) in charge of the Review. Matthiessen divorced in 1956 and began traveling extensively. Writings In 1959, Matthiessen published the first edition of Wildlife in America, a history of the extinction and endangerment of animal and bird species as a consequence of human settlement, throughout North American history, and of the human effort to protect endangered species. In 1965, Matthiessen published At Play in the Fields of the Lord, a novel about a group of American missionaries and their encounter with a South American indigenous tribe. The book was adapted into the film of the same name in 1991. In 1968, he signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\", New York Post, January 30, 1968 His work on oceanographic research, Blue Meridian, with photographer Peter A. Lake, documented the making of the film Blue Water, White Death (1971), directed by Peter Gimbel and Jim Lipscomb. Late in 1973 Matthiessen joined field biologist George Schaller on an expedition in the Himalaya Mountains, which was the basis for The Snow Leopard (1978), his double award-winner. Interested in the Wounded Knee Incident and the 1976 trial and conviction of Leonard Peltier, an American Indian Movement activist, Matthiessen wrote a non-fiction account, In the Spirit of Crazy Horse (1983). In 2008, Matthiessen revisited his trilogy of Florida novels published during the 1990s: Killing Mr. Watson (1990), Lost Man's River (1997) and Bone by Bone (1999), inspired by the frontier years of South Florida and the death of planter Edgar J. Watson shortly after the Southwest Florida Hurricane of 1910. He revised and edited the three books, which had originated as one 1,500-page manuscript, which eventually yielded the award-winning single-volume Shadow Country. While Matthiessen is celebrated for his mastery of both fiction and non-fiction, he always considered himself first and foremost a writer of novels, saying, \\"Like anything that one makes well with one's own hands, writing good nonfiction prose can be profoundly satisfying. Yet after a day of arranging my research, my set of facts, I feel stale and drained, whereas I am energized by fiction. Deep in a novel, one scarcely knows what may surface next, let alone where it comes from. In abandoning oneself to the free creation of something never beheld on earth, one feels almost delirious with a strange joy.\\" Crazy Horse lawsuits Shortly after the 1983 publication of In the Spirit of Crazy Horse, Matthiessen and his publisher Viking Penguin were sued for libel by David Price, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, and William J. Janklow, the former South Dakota governor. The plaintiffs sought over $49 million in damages; Janklow also sued to have all copies of the book withdrawn from bookstores. After four years of litigation, Federal District Court Judge Diana E. Murphy dismissed Price's lawsuit, upholding Matthiessen's \\"freedom to develop a thesis, conduct research in an effort to support the thesis, and to publish an entirely one-sided view of people and events.\\" In the Janklow case, a South Dakota court also ruled for Matthiessen. Both cases were appealed. In 1990, the Supreme Court refused to hear Price's arguments, effectively ending his appeal. The South Dakota Supreme Court dismissed Janklow's case the same year. With the lawsuits concluded, the paperback edition of the book was finally published in 1992. Personal life After graduating from Yale in 1950, Matthiessen became engaged to Patsy Southgate, a Smith graduate whose father had been the chief of protocol in Roosevelt's White House. Matthiessen and Southgate had two children together. They divorced in 1956. In 1963 he married the writer Deborah Love. In his book The Snow Leopard, Matthiessen reported having had a somewhat tempestuous on- again off-again relationship with his wife Deborah, culminating in a deep commitment to each other made shortly before she was diagnosed with cancer. Matthiessen and Deborah practiced Zen Buddhism.Peter Matthiessen at Tibet House She died in New York City near the end of 1972. In September of the following year came the field trip to Himalayan Nepal. Matthiessen later became a Buddhist priest of the White Plum Asanga. He gave dharma transmission to three students: Sensei Madeline Ko-I Bastis, Sensei Michel Engu Dobbs, and Sensei Dorothy Dai-En Friedman.http://www.ciolek.com/WWWVLPages/ZenPages/HaradaYasutani.html Before practicing Zen, Matthiessen was an early pioneer of LSD. He said his Buddhism evolved fairly naturally from his drug experiences. He argued that it was unfortunate that LSD had become outlawed over time, given its potentially beneficial effects as a spiritual and therapeutic tool (when administered with the right care and attention) and was critical of a figure such as Timothy Leary in terms of the long-term reputation of the drug. In 1980, Matthiessen married Maria Eckhart, born in Tanzania, in a Zen ceremony on Long Island, New York. They lived in Sagaponack, New York. Eckhart is the mother of Serial host and Executive Producer Sarah Koenig, who was 10 or 11 years old at the time of the marriage. =Illness and death= Matthiessen was diagnosed with leukemia in late 2012.

The state park lies south of the town of Big Pool, Maryland. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal runs through the park grounds. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973. History =French and Indian War= Fort Frederick was built in 1756-57 by the colony of Maryland. During the French and Indian War in 1756, a ¬£6000 appropriation was authorized by the Maryland Legislature at the request of Governor Horatio Sharpe to build a fortification on the frontier. The fort, named after Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore, was completed the following year. The design of the fort conforms to the style developed early in the 18th century by Sebastien de Vauban, a French military engineer who is considered the father of modern fortification. The large stone fort was designed primarily as a place of refuge for area settlers. Between 1757 and 1758, small raids by Indians in nearby settlements caused settlers in the surrounding countryside to flee eastward. At the same time men of the 60th Regiment of Foot and local militia soldiers garrisoned the fort. Ranging parties were sent from the fort to patrol the area and to deter if not prevent Indian raids. The fort was not designed to resist artillery, as it was correctly assumed that the French would not be able to transport artillery to the remote location from the west. The fort served its purpose in 1763 during Pontiac's Rebellion; however, the fort was never directly attacked. =American Revolutionary War= The fort was used as a prisoner of war camp from 1777 to 1783. As many as 1,000 captured British and German soldiers were incarcerated there after the Battles of Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). =American Civil War= Fort Frederick was sold at auction in 1791 and lay abandoned until the American Civil War. The fort was garrisoned at the outbreak of war and was used as a gun emplacement to protect the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which paralleled the canal. The 1st Maryland Infantry (US) occupied the area in December 1861 and Company H fought in a skirmish at the fort against Confederate raiders on Christmas Day, 1861. The regiment left in February 1862. In October 1862, a picket from the 12th Illinois Cavalry briefly occupied the area. The military usefulness of the fort ended by 1862. =20th Century= In 1922, the property was acquired by the State of Maryland for use as Maryland's first state park. The walls had deteriorated but were standing up to in places. Archaeological investigations and the discovery of the original plans allowed a complete reconstruction. Much of the restoration work of the 1930s was done by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Description The fort is a large stone quadrangle with bastions at each corner. Each face of the curtain wall is about long, high and thick at the base. The bastions project diagonally about , are thick at the base, and were filled with earth to provide a platform. The main gate is located in the center of the south curtain wall. Two of the three barracks buildings have been restored. The west barrack is reconstructed to its 1758 appearance, while the east barrack contains displays regarding the history of the fort. The north barrack, known as the Governor's House, has not been reconstructed. Activities and amenities In addition to tours, displays, and exhibits at the fort, the park also offers a campground, fishing in Big Pool Lake, picnicking facilities, and a nature trail. The Western Maryland Rail Trail begins immediately to the west of the park.

The facial muscles are controlled by the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve), which originates at the brainstem and exits the skull below the ear where it separates into five main branches. This disease takes two forms: typical and atypical. In typical form, the twitching usually starts in the lower eyelid in orbicularis oculi muscle. As time progresses, it spreads to the whole lid, then to the orbicularis oris muscle around the lips, and buccinator muscle in the cheekbone area. The reverse process of twitching occurs in atypical hemifacial spasm; twitching starts in orbicularis oris muscle around the lips, and buccinator muscle in the cheekbone area in the lower face, then progresses up to the orbicularis oculi muscle in the eyelid as time progresses. The most common form is the typical form, and atypical form is only seen in about 2‚Äì3% of patients with hemifacial spasm. The incidence of hemifacial spasm is approximately 0.8 per 100,000 persons. This disorder occurs in both men and women, although it affects middle-aged or elderly women more frequently. Hemifacial spasm is much more common in some Asian populations. It may be caused by a facial nerve injury, a tumor, or it may have no apparent cause. Individuals with spasm on both sides of the face are very rare.  Signs & Symptoms  The first sign of hemifacial spasm is typically muscle movement in the patient's eyelid and around the eye. It can vary in intensity. The intermittent twitching of the eyelid, which can result in forced closure of the eye which gradually spreads to the muscles of the lower part of the face (Typical form- See Image). In atypical form the spasms start in the cheekbone area and spreads to the eyelid. Ultimately, all the muscles on that side are affected, nearly all the time. This sometimes causes the mouth to be pulled to the side. Experts have linked hemifacial spasm to facial nerve injury, Bell's palsy and tumors. Although the most frequent cause is a blood vessel pressing on the facial nerve at the spot where it leaves the patient's brain stem, sometimes there is no known cause. When the affected individual is younger than 40, doctors suspect an underlying cause such as multiple sclerosis.  Causes  The Facial Nerve (The Seventh Cranial Nerve) Three theories exist to explain the facial nerve dysfunction found in hemifacial spasm. The first proposed theory is ephaptic transmission, which is electrical activity crossing from one demyelinated neuron to another resulting in a false synapse. The second theory involves abnormal activity of axons at the facial nerve root end zone secondary to compressive damage/demyelination. The third theory or \\"Kindling theory\\" involves increased excitability of the facial nerve nucleus due to feedback from a damaged facial nerve. It is generally accepted as compression of the facial nerve by vessels of the posterior circulation. In detail compression of the seventh cranial nerve by a dolichoectatic (a distorted, dilated, and elongated) vertebral artery is accepted to be the general cause of hemifacial spasm. Less than 1% of cases are caused by tumor. Hemifacial spasm is much more common in some Asian populations. Several families with hemifacial spasm have been reported, suggesting a genetic etiology or predisposition in some cases. There appears to be an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance in these families with low penetrance, and except for a younger age at onset, the clinical features overlap with the idiopathic cases.Evaluation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes related to vascular change causing compression of blood vessels did not show an association with hemifacial spasm. Clarifying the role of genetic susceptibility in hemifacial spasm may help to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease.  Diagnosis  There are several tests done to diagnose hemifacial spasm. Diagnosing a case of hemifacial spasm begins with a complete neurological exam, including an Electromyography (EMG ‚Äì a test that measures and records electrical activity generated in muscle at rest and in response to muscle contraction), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ‚Äì a test that uses magnetic waves to make pictures of structures inside the head), Computed tomography (CT scan ‚Äì a type of x-ray that uses a computer to make pictures of structures inside the head), and Angiography (an x-ray exam of the blood vessels when they are filled with a contrast material). Studies have shown that the most effective method of hemifacial spasm screening is MRI. In one study only 25% of the CT scans showed the abnormality in hemifacial spasm patients, whilst more than half of the MRI imaging demonstrated a vascular anomaly. MRI imaging should be the initial screening procedure in the assessment of patients with hemifacial spasm.  Prevention  There is no known way to prevent hemifacial spasm.  Treatments  Mild cases of hemifacial spasm may be managed with sedation or carbamazepine (an anticonvulsant drug). Microsurgical decompression and botulinum toxin injections are the current main treatments used for hemifacial spasm. = Microvascular Decompression = Microvascular decompression appears to be the most popular surgical treatment at present. Microvascular decompression relieves pressure on the facial nerve, which is the cause of most hemifacial spasm cases. Excellent to good results are reported in 80% or more cases with a 10% recurrence rate. In the present series approximately 10% had previously failed surgery. Serious complications can follow microsurgical decompressive operations, even when performed by experienced surgeons. These include cerebellar haematoma or swelling, brain stem infarction (blood vessel of the brain stem blocked), cerebral infarction (ischemic stroke resulting from a disturbance in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain), subdural haematoma and intracerebral infarction (blockage of blood flow to the brain). Death or permanent disability (hearing loss) can occur in 2% of patients of hemifacial spasm. = Botulinum Toxin = Botulinum toxin is safe and effective in the treatment of hemifacial spasm. Success rates range between 76-100%, but repeated injections may be required every 3 to 6 months. The injections are administered as an outpatient or office procedure. Whilst side effects occur, these are never permanent. Repeated injections over the years remain highly effective. Whilst the toxin is expensive, the cost of even prolonged courses of injections compares favourably with the cost of surgery. Patients with HFS should be offered a number of treatment options. Very mild cases or those who are reluctant to have surgery or Botulinum toxin injections can be offered medical treatment, sometimes as a temporary measure. In young and fit patients microsurgical decompression and Botulinum injections should be discussed as alternative procedures. In the majority of cases, and especially in the elderly and the unfit, Botulinum toxin injection is the treatment of first choice. Imaging procedures should be done in all unusual cases of hemifacial spasm and when surgery is contemplated. Patients with hemifacial spasm were shown to have decreased sweating after botulinum toxin injections. This was first observed in 1993 by Khalaf Bushara and David Park. This was the first demonstration of nonmuscular use of BTX-A. Bushara further showed the efficacy of botulinum toxin in treating hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating). BTX-A was later approved for the treatment of excessive underarm sweating. This is technically known as severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis ‚Äì excessive underarm sweating with an unknown cause which cannot be managed by topical agents (see focal hyperhidrosis).  Epidemiology  The incidence of hemifacial spasm is approximately 0.8 per 100,000 persons. Hemifacial spasm is more prevalent among females over 40 years of age. The estimated prevalence for women is 14.5 per 100,000 and 7.4 per 100,000 in men. Prevalence for hemifacial spasm increase with age, reaching 39.7 per 100,000 for those aged 70 years and older. One study divided 214 hemifacial patients based on the cause of the disease. The patients who had a compression in the facial nerve at the end of the brain stem as the primary hemifacial spasm and patients who had peripheral facial palsy or nerve lesion due to tumors, demyelination, trauma, or infection as secondary hemifacial spasm. The study found that 77% of hemifacial spasm is due to primary hemifacial spasm and 23% is due to secondary hemifacial spasm. The study also found both sets of patients to share similar age at onset, male to female ratios, and similar affected side. Another study with 2050 patients presented with hemifacial spasm between 1986 and 2009, only 9 cases were caused by a cerebellopontine angle syndrome, an incidence of 0.44%.  History  The earliest descriptions about hemifacial spasm is by Shultze in 1875 and Gowers in 1899. The etiology of hemifacial spasm and location of the abnormality have been debated for more than a century. Surgical treatment for hemifacial spasm in the early 20th century included neurolysis (destruction of nerve tissue), stretching the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve), and high-pressure irrigation of the nerve with lactate ringer's solution. The medical regimens of that time involved injection of the nerve with ethanol, electrical stimulation, application of toxic compounds (nitrate of silver, zinc, arsenic, bromides) as well as medications such as Dilantin or other anticonvulsants. Additional advances in understanding the etiology and improving treatments for hemifacial spasm did not occur until the mid-seventies. In 1977, 47 cases of hemifacial spasm underwent microvascular decompression of the facial nerve using the operating microscope. The results illustrated nerve-vessel conflicts (or cholesteatoma) to be located at the root exit zone of the facial nerve in all cases. The root exit zone is where the central glial axonal insulation of the nerve ends and the peripheral nerve axonal myelination begins, this is known as The Obersteiner-Redlich zone. Biopsies of the root exit zone demonstrated degeneration of axons, denuded axis cylinder and interrupted myelin. The results of the experiment strengthened the theory that vascular compression of the facial nerve was the primary cause of hemifacial spasm, and proposed a specific region of the facial nerve where the effects of longstanding compression results in nerve dysfunction.

The approximately route connects two Interstate highways in Fremont in the San Francisco Bay Area, Interstate 680 and Interstate 880. Route description SR 262 begins at its western interchange with Interstate 880 in Fremont. It travels east to its terminus and junction with Interstate 680 in Fremont. SR 262 was built solely to be a link between the two interstates and lies at the point that Interstates 880 and 680 are closest together in the East Bay. north of SR 262, I-680 abruptly turns to the Northeast and into the Sunol and Livermore Valley thus making SR 262 a vital link between those valleys and the Silicon Valley to the south. Physically SR 262 begins as a 6 lane road that has been built to freeway standards for its first half mile and after intersecting Kato Road and Warren Avenue with separated grade intersections built in 2008 and 2015, respectively. The remaining half mile is a 4-6 lane city street with two traffic lights at Warm Springs Blvd and Mohave Drive before terminating at a cloverleaf interchange at I-680. SR 262 is unsigned along its entire route and would be unnoticeable to the public if not for two guide signs placed in the early 2000s on south I-680 that designate the exit as \\"SR 262 to I-880 Mission Blvd\\". There is no other signage on I-880 that designates the road by its route number. Signage for the southbound I-680 toll express lane, opened in September 2010, indicates an exit at \\"262 - Mission Blvd.\\" Locals are largely unaware of the route designation and refer to the road as Mission Blvd exclusively. Street signage of Route 262 appeared in 2018 at Warm Springs Boulevard. SR 262 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History Originally SR 262 was slated to run the route of present-day Oakland Road from San Jose to where present day Warm Springs Blvd and Mission Blvd intersect. This plan was scrapped when State Route 17 (later I-880) was constructed. SR 262 was subsequently routed along its present route. One planning option was for SR 262 to be deleted from the state route list when State Route 237 to the south was completed between I-880 and I-680. However, there is no longer room between the developed areas to build 237 into a freeway there. SR 262 is also a signed section of the Juan Bautista De Anza National Historic Trail.

De la banda de ac√° del r√≠o, de la banda de all√° del monte), was the name of the South American territories east of the Uruguay River and north of R√≠o de la Plata that comprise the modern nation of Uruguay; the modern state of Brazil Rio Grande do Sul; and some of Santa Catarina, Brazil. It was the easternmost territory of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. After decades of disputes over the territories, the 1777 First Treaty of San Ildefonso settled the division between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire: the southern part was to be held by the Spanish Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata and the northern territories by the Portuguese Capitania de S√£o Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul (). The Banda Oriental was not a separate administrative unit until the de facto creation of the Provincia Oriental () by Jos√© Gervasio Artigas in 1813 and the subsequent decree of the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata of 7 March 1814, which formally established the Gobernaci√≥n Intendencia Oriental del R√≠o de la Plata (), making it a constituent part of the United Provinces of South America. Indigenous tribes and the 16th century Map of 1574 showing the Portuguese Captaincies Before the arrival of the Spanish and the Portuguese, several tribes of indigenous people were living in this area as nomads. The principal ones were the Charr√∫as, the Chan√°s, the Guayanas and the Guaran√≠es. Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s discovered this territory in 1516. During the conquest of the R√≠o de la Plata area by the \\"Adelantados\\" (1535‚Äì1590), the main concern was to reach the interior in search of precious metals, so this region remained mostly ignored. The first ephemeral Spanish attempts to start populated centres in this territory happened between 1527 and 1577. These were the Fort√≠n de San L√°zaro (actual Carmelo) and the Puerto de San Salvador (1527‚Äì1530) by Sebasti√°n Gaboto, the Real de San Juan (1542‚Äì1553) and the Real de San Gabriel y Ciudad de San Salvador (1573‚Äì1577) by Juan Ortiz de Z√°rate. In 1542 the Crown of Castile established the Viceroyalty of Peru, a colonial administrative district that originally contained most of Spanish-ruled South America, governed from the capital of Lima. The Banda Oriental was therefore officially under the administration of the Viceroyalty of Peru from 1542 up to 1776. Although the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) limited the Portuguese colonies to the east of the 46th meridian, in practice, the Portuguese were free to advance in most of the territory that was not colonized by the Spanish, which included most of the Banda Oriental. 17th century In the early 17th century the territory was called Banda Charr√∫a, later Otra Banda (\\"other shore\\"), and then Banda Oriental.El Pa√≠s newspaper: Banda Charr√∫a, not Banda Oriental Later the name was extended to encompass Entre R√≠os, to describe the territories in those latitudes that lead to the Mar del Nord (Atlantic Ocean). The area north of the Banda Oriental was the territory called by the Guaran√≠ word Mbiaza or Ibiaz√°, rendered in Spanish as La Vera. Monument to Hernandarias in Montevideo In 1618, during the governance of Hernando Arias de Saavedra (commonly known as Hernandarias), the Banda Oriental was integrated into the Spanish colonial Governorate of the R√≠o de la Plata. Following the recommendation of the King of Spain, Hernandarias introduced a large amount of cattle in the Banda Oriental, an act which has played a decisive role in the future of the economy of the area. Starting around 1626, fathers of the Franciscan order attempted to establish reductions south of R√≠o Negro. Some of them were short-lived missions like the San Francisco de los Olivares de los Charr√∫as, the San Antonio de los Chan√°es and the San Juan de C√©spedes. In contrast, the one of Santo Domingo Soriano, founded with Charr√∫as and Chan√°es in Entre R√≠os, Argentina, in 1664, was moved on the Isle of Vizca√≠no, on the mouth of R√≠o Negro and then in 1718 it was moved again at its present location in the modern Soriano Department. Tile panel depicting the foundation of Colonia del Sacramento in 1680 Another notable development came from the reductions of the Compa√±√≠a de Jes√∫s further north the Uruguay River, where indigenous Guaran√≠es and Tapes were being kidnapped from the missions by the bandeirantes to be used as slaves in the coffee plantations of S√£o Paulo. To prevent this, in 1631, father Antonio Ruiz de Montoya migrated with 12,000 Guaran√≠es further east, in the modern State of Paran√° of Brazil, while in 1636, father Nicol√°s del Techo migrated with another 12,000 Tapes towards the modern Rio Grande do Sul, which constituted the north part of the Banda Oriental of the times. Although Spain claimed the territory of the Banda Oriental, based on the Treaty of Tordesillas, it did not officially belong to the Spanish Crown during the 17th century. The Portuguese, being able to advance without resistance in the sparsely populated territory, founded the city Colonia del Sacramento on the banks of Rio de la Plata, across from Buenos Aires, in 1680. Apart from being seen as an evidence that the Portuguese intended to occupy all of the territory, this port in the mouth of the Uruguay River also permitted the Portuguese ships to carry out illegal trade evading Spanish taxation. Spain took the city twice, in 1681 and in 1705, but had to give it back by the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713. 18th century Monument to Bruno Mauricio de Zabala in Montevideo. The following years saw an expansion of the Portuguese settlements around Colonia del Sacramento, until 1723, when Field Marshal Manuel de Freitas da Fonseca of Portugal built the Montevieu fort. As a reaction, on 22 January 1724 a Spanish expedition was sent from Buenos Aires, organized by the Governor of R√≠o de la Plata, Bruno Mauricio de Zabala, who forced the Portuguese to abandon the location and founded and fortified Montevideo. The Spanish started populating the city, initially with six families moving in from Buenos Aires and soon thereafter by families arriving from the Canary Islands who were called by the locals \\"guanches\\", \\"guanchos\\" or \\"canarios\\". In this way Montevideo became the center of Spanish control over the Banda Oriental. Its government was carried out by the Cabildo, in which criollos (locally born people of pure or mostly Spanish ancestry) could participate. In 1750, the office of Governor of Montevideo was created, with jurisdiction in the southern departments of the modern Uruguay. The rest of the territories of the modern Uruguay, along with part of the modern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul remained under the jurisdiction of the Superintendencia de Buenos Aires, while another part of the territory of the Banda Oriental at the northwest was governed by the authorities of the Missions. The Portuguese, having lost the possibility of building a fort in Montevideo, established the Fort of San Miguel in 1737 and then the much larger Fortaleza de Santa Teresa in 1762 on the Atlantic coast of the current Rocha Department, in order to keep a route open for their southward advances into the sparsely populated territories of the Banda Oriental. The Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750) between the kings of Spain and Portugal, allowed further expansion of the Portuguese Empire west of the 46th meridian. The treaty also stipulated that Spain would receive Colonia del Sacramento and Portugal would receive the Misiones Orientales. This, however, resulted in the Guaran√≠ War (1754‚Äì1756), after which the Treaty of El Pardo (1761) repealed all aspects of the previous treaty. =Spanish‚ÄìPortuguese Wars= The First Cevallos expedition was a military action between September 1762 and April 1763, by the Spanish forces led by Don Pedro Antonio de Cevallos, Governor of Buenos Aires, against the Portuguese in the Banda Oriental as part of the Seven Years' War. The Portuguese territories of Colonia del Sacramento were conquered by the Spanish and the Anglo-Portuguese forces were defeated and forced to surrender and retreat. Colonia del Sacramento and the nearby territories came under Spanish control until the Treaty of Paris (1763), by which all the territory conquered by the first Cevallos expedition was given back to Portugal. Santa Tecla, San Miguel, Santa Teresa and Rio Grande de S√£o Pedro, however, remained in Spanish hands, which became the cause of further Portuguese attacks. At the conclusion of the Spanish‚ÄìPortuguese War of 1776-1777, by the First Treaty of San Ildefonso, Spain returned the island of Santa Catarina to Portugal and recognized Rio Grande de S√£o Pedro as Portuguese territory, but kept the Colonia del Sacramento, along with the Banda Oriental, and the Misiones Orientales. In this way the Banda Oriental became integrated into the Viceroyalty of R√≠o de la Plata (1776‚Äì1814). The line that separated the Spanish from the Portuguese territories, however, was a sinuous one, which lacking any natural formations to define it precisely, underwent various changes during the next decades. In 1796, the body of the Blandengues was formed to protect the ranchers and peasants from vagrancy, theft and contraband. The government, lacking resources, offered to pardon any outlaws that would join this body, and they in turn brought also their horses into it. 19th century A result of the Anglo-Spanish War (1796‚Äì1808) in Europe, were the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata of 1806‚Äì1807. The invasions occurred in two phases. A detachment from the British army occupied Buenos Aires for 46 days in 1806 before being expelled. On 3 February 1807, during the Battle of Montevideo, the British captured the city and occupied it for half a year. They had to abandon it after their defeat in the Second Battle of Buenos Aires and the armistice of 12 August 1807. The social effects of the British invasions have been among the causes of the May Revolution of 25 May 1810. During the British occupation of Montevideo, Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, who had joined the body of Blandengues since 1797, organized groups of gauchos and engaged in guerrilla war against the invaders. As a result, he was promoted to Captain of the Blandengues by the Spanish in 1809. However, when the Primera Junta was proclaimed in Buenos Aires, Artigas abandoned the ranks of the Spanish and joined the revolution, which promoted him to Colonel. With little help from Buenos Aires, he was sent to organize a rebellion in the Banda Oriental, where Montevideo was now the new capital of the viceroyalty, with Francisco Javier de El√≠o as the new viceroy. The Battle of Las Piedras (1811) was the decisive defeat of El√≠o by land, although he was still keeping Montevideo supported by naval forces. At this point, El√≠o allied himself with Brazilian forces and requested their intervention in the conflict. Fearing defeat, Buenos Aires signed a truce with El√≠o, recognizing him as the ruler of the Banda Oriental and half of Entre R√≠os. Considering this a treacherous move, Artigas abandoned the blockade over Montevideo and moved to Entre Rios with his supporters. =Provincia Oriental (1813‚Äì1817)= * Second Banda Oriental campaign * Liga Federal =Provincia Cisplatina (1817‚Äì1828)= The United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves conquered the southern part in 1817 and renamed it the Prov√≠ncia Cisplatina. By the mid-1820s, the Thirty-Three Orientals led a revolution against its successor state (the Brazilian Empire), igniting the Cisplatine War. At its conclusion, in 1828, the former Provincia Oriental was declared an independent state, Uruguay, by the Treaty of Montevideo. Uruguaiana remained with Brazil. The northern part, between the years of 1836 and 1845, formed a full independent republic, named as Riograndense Republic. This territory was reconquered by the Brazilian Empire in the Ragamuffin War, and rejoined the empire under the Poncho Verde Treaty. It is today the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Sul.

He was a friend of Hedylus and possibly of Theocritus.Aside from the clear indication that his work was known to poets like Callimachus and Theocritus who worked at Alexandria, it has never been established with any certainty that Asclepiades visited the city. Recently, A. Cameron has sought to confirm his sojourn there by reference to several epigrams ... He may have been honoured by the city of Histiaea in about 263 BC.Syll.3492, line 17 - English translation. Asclepiades was the earliest and most important of the convivial and erotic epigrammists. Only a few of his compositions were intended as actual inscriptions, if any. Translated by Alexander Sens Other poems sing the praises of those poets whom he especially admired, but the majority of his work that has survived is love songs. It is doubtful whether he is the author of all the epigrams (some 40 in number) which bear his name in the Greek Anthology. He has been credited with creating the metre which bears his name, the Asclepiad metre. The sole source for the known, unlacunaed epigrams of Asclepiades is the Greek Anthology. Most of Asclepiades's epigrams appear in both of the two principal Byzantine epigram collections that constitute the Greek Anthology: the Palatine Anthology and the Planudean Anthology. Epigrams xxxix and xliii appear only in the Planudean Anthology, which is the less complete of the two so far as the epigrams of Asclepiades are concerned, all the rest are in the Palatine Anthology. Some papyri have been recovered that contain portions of known epigrams and portions of otherwise unknown epigrams attributed to Asclepiades.

A bonkei contains no living material, in contrast with related Japanese art forms bonsai and saikei: bonsai contain living trees, and saikei contain living trees and other vegetation.  Description  Its three-dimensional character and permanence distinguish bonkei from bonseki, which is a Japanese form of sand-painting that produces mostly-flat images on a display tray, usually for transient viewing before being erased for a new creation. Although bonkei materials are usually dry, flowing water and seasides are often depicted, with varying colors of gravel or sand making up the land and the water elements. A bonkei may also contain miniature figures of people, animals, buildings, bridges, and other common outdoor items. The goal of the form is to provide an aesthetically pleasing miniature landscape for display and contemplation. The landscape is depicted in full three dimensions, and contained in a wide, low- sided tray. Raised areas representing river banks, hills, cliffs, or mountains are built up from sculptable materials like ciment fondu, clay, papier mache, or a dried and powdered peat called keto in Japan. These sculpted elements are frequently painted to resemble the natural environment as closely as possible, for example, through painting ice, rock, and vegetation colors onto sculpted mountains. Flat areas representing plains or open water are covered with colored sand or gravel. Real rocks may be embedded in the landscape. Human and animal figurines and miniature models of structures and vehicles are placed on top of the bonkei's base landscape to create a fully realized scene. Even model trees and other vegetation may be incorporated, though live plants are not generally considered elements of bonkei. The completed bonkei can be displayed in the home similar to \\"a bonsai, a painting, or a floral arrangement - at proper height, against an uncluttered background\\". Bonkei is similar in some ways to the Japanese saikei (plant landscape), Chinese penjing, or Vietnamese hon non bo art forms. Although the aesthetic goals and practical aspects of model railroads are quite different, some similarities with bonkei can be seen in the model railroader's depiction of the natural environment. Robert Behme says that bonkei differs from saikei in that a bonkei \\"is essentially a dry landscape, and living plants are rarely used; a saikei depends exclusively on living plants for effect.\\" As a result of this key difference, many bonkei specimens can last a long time with no maintenance, where a saikei requires frequent tending and a favorable environment for growth of the trees and other vegetation it contains.  History  The ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Yoshishige (Ê≠åÂ∑ùËä≥Èáç) created a series of prints of bonkei and saikei titled 53 Stations of the T≈çkaid≈ç as Potted Landscapes (Tokaido Gojusan-eki Hachiyama Edyu) in 1848. The book might have been inspired by Utagawa Hiroshige's The Fifty-three Stations of the T≈çkaid≈ç.

The film also features supporting performances from Roberts Blossom and Kelly Preston. Written by Bill Phillips and based on Stephen King‚Äôs 1983 novel of the same name, the movie follows the changes in the lives of Arnie Cunningham, his friends, his family, and his teenage enemies after Arnie buys a classic Red and white 1958 Plymouth Fury named Christine, licence number CQB 241, a car that seems to have a jealous, possessive personality ‚Äì and a mind of its own. Upon its release, the film grossed $21 million at the US box office. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics and has since become a cult classic. Plot In September 1957, at a Chrysler Corporation assembly plant in Detroit, the hood of a newly assembled, red-and-white 1958 Plymouth Fury slams down without warning and crushes the hand of a line worker inspecting its front end. Another worker climbs in to sit behind the wheel, letting the ash from his cigar fall on the front seat. At the end of the shift, the line supervisor notices the car's radio is playing music; when he opens the door to shut it off, the worker's corpse falls out onto the floor. Twenty-one years later, in September 1978, Arnold \\"Arnie\\" Cunningham is an awkward and unpopular teenager in Rockbridge, California, with only one friend, football player Dennis Guilder. Arnie's life begins to change when he buys the used, dilapidated Fury from George LeBay, whose late brother Roland had originally owned it. George tells Arnie several details about the car, including its name: \\"Christine\\". Since his parents will not let him keep the car at their house, Arnie begins to restore it at a do-it-yourself garage and junkyard owned by Will Darnell. As Arnie spends more of his time working on the car, he discards his glasses, dresses more like a 1950s greaser, and develops an arrogant, paranoid personality. Unbeknownst to Arnie, Dennis learned from Arnie's mother that Roland actually committed suicide in the car. Confronted by Dennis, George admits that Roland's daughter had choked to death in the car and that his wife also committed suicide in it. George forced Roland to get rid of Christine after Roland's wife's death, but the car returned to him after three weeks. During a football game, Dennis becomes distracted by the sight of Arnie kissing his new girlfriend, Leigh Cabot, in front of a now-perfect Christine and is tackled, suffering a career-ending injury. One of Christine's windshield wipers stops working while Arnie and Leigh are on a date at a drive-in movie theater. When he gets out to fix it, Leigh begins to choke on a hamburger. The doors lock themselves, leaving Arnie unable to help her, but she frees herself and is saved when a man in a nearby car administers the Heimlich maneuver. Soon afterward, school bully Buddy Repperton - angry with Arnie over being expelled after a confrontation in shop class - vandalizes Christine with the help of his gang. Arnie is devastated and determined to repair Christine but is surprised to see her quickly restore herself. Christine then seeks out the vandals, crushing one in an alley, triggering a gas station explosion that kills two others and sets the car on fire, and finally running down Buddy himself. After the badly burned Christine returns to Darnell's garage, Darnell sits in the driver's seat and is crushed to death against the steering wheel when Christine pushes the seat forward. The next morning, Christine is back in its slot and fully repaired. State police detective Rudolph Junkins becomes suspicious of Arnie, having discovered paint from Christine at the scenes of two gang members' deaths. However, he has no direct evidence to implicate Arnie, who has an alibi. Junkins either does not know or cannot believe that Christine can drive herself. Following the choking incident and Christine's initial vandalization, Leigh breaks up with Arnie. Dennis and Leigh conclude the only way to save Arnie is to destroy Christine. They set a trap for it at Darnell's garage: Dennis waits at the controls of a bulldozer, while Leigh stands ready to close the garage doors and cut off Christine's retreat once it enters. However, Christine has been lying in wait under a pile of debris in the garage the entire time, and it strikes when Leigh takes up her position at the door controls. Christine crashes through Darnell's office in an attempt to get at Leigh. Arnie ‚Äì who has been driving the car himself ‚Äì is thrown through the windshield and impaled on a shard of glass, which kills him. Dennis and Leigh attack Christine with the bulldozer, but it continually repairs itself and strikes back. The battle continues until they repeatedly drive back and forth over the car, damaging Christine so much that it is unable to immediately regenerate. The next day, Dennis, Leigh and Junkins watch as Christine's remains are compacted by a car crusher in a junkyard and dropped on the ground as a solid block. Junkins praises Dennis and Leigh for defeating the demonic vehicle, despite them mourning the loss of Arnie and their inability to save him. As the camera zooms in slowly on the remains, a portion of the front grill begins to twitch.

Through producing the miniseries, Kobritz became acquainted with King, who sent him manuscripts of two of his novels, Cujo, and Christine. Kobritz purchased the rights to Christine after finding himself attracted to the novel's \\"celebration of America's obsession with the motorcar.\\" Kobritz's first choice for director was John Carpenter, who was initially unavailable due to two projects: an adaptation of another King novel, Firestarter, and an adaptation of the 1980 Eric Van Lustbader novel The Ninja. However, production delays on these projects allowed Carpenter to accept the director position for Christine. Kobritz and Carpenter had previously collaborated in the 1978 television film Someone's Watching Me!. Bill Phillips was Carpenter's choice for writer and was brought on shortly after Carpenter arrived. Carpenter was also joined by special effects supervisor Roy Arbogast, who had previously worked with Carpenter in The Thing (1982). According to Carpenter, Christine was not a film he had planned on directing, saying that he directed the film as \\"a job\\" as opposed to a \\"personal project.\\" He had previously directed The Thing, which had done poorly at the box office and led to critical backlash. In retrospect, Carpenter stated that upon reading Christine, he felt that \\"It just wasn't very frightening. But it was something I needed to do at that time for my career.\\" King's novel, the source material for Carpenter's film, made it clear that the car was possessed by the evil spirit of its previous owner, Roland D. LeBay, whereas the film version of the story shows that the evil spirit of the car manifested itself on the day it was built.Carpenter, John. Audio commentary, Christine [Blu-ray]. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. 2015. Other elements from the novel were altered for the film, particularly the execution of the death scenes, which the filmmakers opted for a more \\"cinematic approach.\\" =Casting= Initially, Columbia Pictures had wanted to cast Brooke Shields in the role of Leigh due to her publicity after the release of The Blue Lagoon (1981), and Scott Baio as Arnie. The filmmakers declined the suggestion, opting to cast young actors who were still fairly unknown. Kevin Bacon auditioned for the role, but opted out when offered a part in Footloose (1984). Carpenter cast Keith Gordon in the role of Arnie after an audition in New York City; Gordon had some experience in film, and was also working in theater at the time; John Stockwell was cast at an audition in Los Angeles. Nineteen-year-old Alexandra Paul was cast in the film after audition in New York City; according to Carpenter, Paul was an \\"untrained, young actress\\" at the time, but brought a \\"great quality\\" about the character of Leigh. According to Paul, she had not read any of King's books or seen Carpenter's films, and read the novel in preparation. =Filming= Christine was shot largely in Los Angeles, California, while the location for Darnell's garage was located in Santa Clarita. Filming began in April 1983, merely days after the King novel had been published. An abandoned furniture factory in Irwindale was used for the opening scene. The film's stunts were primarily completed by stunt coordinator Terry Leonard, who was behind the wheel of the car during the high-speed chase scenes, as well as the scene in which the car drives down a highway engulfed in flames. During that scene, Leonard wore a Nomex firefighter's suit complete with breathing apparatus. Alexandra Paul's identical twin sister Caroline Paul wrote that she and her sister pulled a prank during filming, sending Caroline on set in place of Alexandra without telling Carpenter that they had made the switch until after he had shot a scene. She wrote, \\"My highly skilled clutch-pushing actually made it into the movie.\\" =The car= One of the two remaining models of Christine used in the filmAlthough the car in the film is identified as a 1958 Plymouth Fury ‚Äì and in 1983 radio ads promoting the film, voiceover artists announced, \\"she's a '57 Fury\\" ‚Äì two other Plymouth models, the Belvedere and the Savoy, were also used to portray the malevolent automobile onscreen. John Carpenter placed ads throughout Southern California searching for models of the car, and was able to purchase twenty-four of them in various states of disrepair, which were used to build a total of seventeen copies of the film car. All cars were two door hardtops. Total production for the 1958 Plymouth Fury was only 5,303, and they were difficult to find and expensive to buy at the time. In addition, the real-life Furys only came in one color, \\"Sandstone White\\" with a \\"Buckskin Beige\\" interior, seen on the other Furys on the assembly line during the initial scenes of the movie, though the car in King's novel was ordered with a red-and-white custom paint job. The original Furies had anodized gold trim on the body and Fury script on the rear fender. In order to bypass the problem of obtaining the rare trim, the cars featured the more common Belvedere \\"Dartline\\" trim. Several vehicles were destroyed during filming, but most of the cars were Savoy and Belvedere models dressed to look like the Fury. At least one '57 Savoy was used, its front end modified to look like a '58. Some of King's details about the car were incorrect in the novel. The 1956-1958 Plymouth Fury was only available as a two-door coupe, while the book described it as a four-door sedan, which would have made it a Savoy or Belvedere model. During Leigh's choking scene, Christine is shown to have common vertical lock \\"buttons\\" on the inside door panels. Chrysler vehicles of this era were not equipped with such buttons. To lock the door, the door handle has to be pushed downward. King also mentions a shift lever for the automatic transmission, but in real life it had push-button controls. Originally, Carpenter had not planned to film the car's regeneration scenes, but gave special effects supervisor Roy Arbogast three weeks to devise a way for the car to rebuild itself. Arbogast and his team made rubber molds from one of the cars, including a whole front end. One of the cars was stripped of its engine to accommodate internally-mounted hydraulics that pulled the framework inward, crumpling the car, with the shot then run backwards in the final film. Of the twenty-three cars used in the film, the best known surviving vehicle was rescued from a junkyard and restored by collector Bill Gibson of Pensacola, Florida. Release =Box office= Christine was released in North America on December 9, 1983, to 1,045 theaters. In its opening weekend Christine brought in $3,408,904 landing at #4. The film dropped 39.6% in its second weekend, grossing $2,058,517 slipping from fourth to eighth place. In its third weekend, it grossed $1,851,909 dropping to #9.

In its seventh and final weekend, the film brought in $819,972 landing at #14, bringing the total gross for Christine to $21,017,849. =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Christine holds a 69% approval rating based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 5.94/10. The consensus reads: \\"The cracks are starting to show in John Carpenter's directorial instincts, but Christine is nonetheless silly, zippy fun.‚Äù Roger Ebert gave the movie three out of four stars, saying: \\"by the end of the movie, Christine has developed such a formidable personality that we are actually taking sides during its duel with a bulldozer. This is the kind of movie where you walk out with a silly grin, get in your car, and lay rubber halfway down the Eisenhower.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a middling review, saying: \\"The early parts of the film are engaging and well acted, creating a believable high-school atmosphere. Unfortunately, the later part of the film is slow in developing, and it unfolds in predictable ways.\\" Variety gave the film a negative review, stating: \\"Christine seems like a retread. This time it‚Äôs a fire-engine red, 1958 Plymouth Fury that‚Äôs possessed by the Devil, and this deja-vu premise [from the novel by Stephen King] combined with the crazed-vehicle format, makes Christine appear pretty shop worn.\\" Time Out said of the film: \\"Carpenter and novelist Stephen King share not merely a taste for genre horror but a love of '50's teenage culture; and although set in the present, Christine reflects the second taste far more effectively than the first.\\" =Home media= The film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment on August 4, 1998.

The film is one of two released in 1976 that were based on a real illegal cross-continent road race that took place for a number of years in the United States (the other being The Gumball Rally). The same topic later became the basis for the films The Cannonball Run, Cannonball Run II and Speed Zone. The film was written and directed by Paul Bartel, who also directed Death Race 2000. The name of the film and the plot were inspired by Erwin G. \\"Cannon Ball\\" Baker (1882‚Äì1960), who traveled across the United States several times, and by the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, an illegal cross-continent road race introduced by Brock Yates to protest against the 55 MPH speed limit. Plot The Trans-America Grand Prix is an illegal race held every year between Los Angeles (Santa Monica Pier) and New York City. Recently released from jail, where he was serving a sentence for killing a girl while driving drunk, racing driver Coy \\"Cannonball\\" Buckman (David Carradine) hopes to win the race and get his career back on track. Racing team Modern Motors have promised a contract to either him or his arch-rival Cade Redman (Bill McKinney) who is also in the race ‚Äì the contract will go to whichever of them wins. Coy is still on probation and when his parole officer, Linda Maxwell (Veronica Hamel), with whom he is having an elaborate affair, discovers he will be crossing state lines in violation of his parole, she attempts to stop him, only to have him force her to accompany him on the race. Redman also has company in the form of country singer Perman Waters (Gerrit Graham) and his manager Sharma Capri (Judy Canova) who have agreed to pay Redman's race expenses in return for his taking them with him to New York in his Dodge Charger. Other competitors include teenage surfer sweethearts Jim Crandell (Robert Carradine) and Maryann (Belinda Balaski) driving Maryann's father's Chevrolet Corvette, middle-aged Terry McMillan in a Chevrolet Blazer, three sexy waitresses, Sandy (Mary Woronov), Ginny (Glynn Rubin) and Wendy (Diane Lee Hart) in a souped-up van, arrogant German driver Wolfe Messer (James Keach) in a De Tomaso Pantera, preppy African-American Beutell (Stanley Bennett Clay) in a Lincoln Continental; he has been hired by a wealthy elderly couple to transport to New York for them (unaware that he is using it to enter the race) and Buckman's best friend Zippo (Archie Hahn) in a Pontiac Trans Am identical to Coy's. Unbeknown to Coy, his brother Bennie (Dick Miller) has bet heavily on the race and plans to use underhand methods to ensure Coy wins. As the race degenerates into a violent demolition derby, Messer is blown up by Bennie, while McMillan attempts to cheat by having his Blazer flown from LAX to New York's LaGuardia Airport where he waits out the race with his mistress Louisa (Louisa Moritz). Beutell's borrowed Lincoln gets progressively more damaged as the race goes on, while Jim and Maryann face engine trouble with a broken fan belt. The rivalry between Coy and the increasingly unstable Redman gets out of control as the two fight and attempt to force each other off the road, with Coy crashing his Trans Am after Redman breaks the headlights. Switching to a 1969 Ford Mustang he borrows from some local hot-rodders, Coy has a last showdown with Redman, who has kicked Perman and Sharma out of his car after arguing with them. A piece of Perman's guitar, which Redman smashed in a rage after getting sick of Perman's singing and on-the-road radio broadcasts, gets lodged behind the car pedals, causing Redman to lose control and crash over the side of an unfinished bridge. He dies when the car explodes. Bennie meanwhile, has sent a gunman to kill the driver of the \\"other\\" red Trans Am as it is beating Coy. He is unaware that the driver is Zippo or that Linda is now riding with him, as Coy thought it safer for her to do so since Redman was after him. While with Zippo, she has found out that it was Zippo who was driving the car in which the girl was killed, not Coy. Coy took the blame because he knew the weaker Zippo would never survive in jail. Bennie's gunman shoots Zippo dead and the Trans Am crashes and explodes. Linda jumps clear, but is badly injured. Jim and Maryann see the wreck and pick up the comatose Linda, taking her to hospital. Behind them, the presence of the wrecked Trans Am on the freeway causes a multiple-car pileup. Terry McMillan and Louisa arrive first at the finish line, but Louisa lets slip that the Blazer was flown there and he is disqualified. The girls in the van and Coy are neck-and-neck as they cross into New York City (with Coy driving over the George Washington Bridge and the girls taking the Lincoln Tunnel until Sandy attempts to take a shortcut when the girls get lost and are stuck in traffic and the van crashes. Coy arrives at the finish line and is about to stamp his timecard, making him the official winner, when he is told about Zippo and Linda's accident and realizes Bennie caused it. He tears up his timecard so it can't be stamped and gives the pieces to Bennie, who is taken away by gangster Lester Marks (played by the film's director Paul Bartel) to whom he owes all the money he bet on Coy, presumably to be killed. Assured of his racing contract, Coy is taken to the hospital to be reunited with Linda by the team manager. Having decided to finish the race in spite of believing they cannot win having lost so much time, Jim and Maryann are the next to arrive at the finish line. They are surprised and overjoyed to be told they are the winners of the $100,000 first place prize. At the hospital, Coy and Linda enjoy their reunion, while Beutell delivers the Lincoln ‚Äì now completely wrecked ‚Äì to its horrified owners in front of a hotel in the city.

He attempted to build a new theory of disease, based on the flow of atoms through pores in the body. His treatments sought to restore harmony through the use of diet, exercise, and bathing. Life Asclepiades was born in Prusias-on-Sea in Bithynia. He travelled extensively when young, and seems at first to have settled at Rome to work as a rhetorician.Pliny, Hist. Nat. xxvi. 7 In that profession he did not succeed, but he acquired a great reputation as a physician. His pupils were very numerous, and his most distinguished pupil, Themison of Laodicea, founded the Methodic school. It is not known specifically when he died, except that it was at an advanced age. It was said that he laid a wager with Fortune, that he would forfeit his character as a physician if he should ever suffer from any disease himself. Pliny the Elder, who tells the anecdote,Pliny, Hist. Nat. vii. 37 adds that he won his wager, for he reached a great age and died at last from an accident. Nothing remains of his writings but a few fragments. The family lineage of Asclepiades is not known. It is assumed that his father was a doctor due to ancient physicians coming from medical families. He received the names Philosophicus due to his knowledge of philosophy and Pharmacion for his knowledge of medicinal herbs. Antiochus of Ascalon said about Asclepiades, \\"second to none in the art of medicine and acquainted with philosophy too.\\"John Scarborough Pharmacy in History Vol. 17, No. 2 (1975), pp 43-57 Medicine Asclepiades began by vilifying the principles and practices of his predecessors, and by asserting that he had discovered a more effective method of treating diseases than had been before known to the world. He decried the efforts of those who sought to investigate the structure of the body, or to watch the phenomena of disease, and he is said to have directed his attacks particularly against the writings of Hippocrates. Discarding the humoral doctrine of Hippocrates, Asclepiades attempted to build a new theory of disease, and founded his medical practice on a modification of the atomic or corpuscular theory, according to which disease results from an irregular or inharmonious motion of the corpuscles of the body. His ideas were likely partly derived from the atomic theories of Democritus and Epicurus. All morbid action was reduced to the obstruction of pores and irregular distribution of atoms. Asclepiades arranged diseases into two great classes of Acute and Chronic.Caelius Aurelianus, De Morb. Chron. iii. 8. p. 469 Acute diseases were caused essentially by a constriction of the pores, or an obstruction of them by an excess of atoms; the Chronic were caused by a relaxation of the pores or a deficiency of atoms. Asclepiades thought that other mild disease were caused by a disruption in bodily fluids and pneuma. He separated illnesses into three separate categories: status strictus (too tightly held), status laxus (too loosely held), and status mixtus (a little of each). He also believed that there were no critical days of diseases, meaning that illnesses do not end at a definite time. Asclepiades' remedies were, therefore, directed to the restoration of harmony. He trusted much to changes of diet, massages, bathing and exercise, although he did employ emetics and bleeding. A part of the great popularity which he enjoyed depended upon his prescribing the liberal use of wine to his patients,Pliny, Hist. Nat. vii. 37, xxiii. 22 and upon his attending to their every need, and indulging their inclinations. He would treat all his patients fairly and did not discriminate based upon gender or mental illness. He believed treating his patients kindly and amicably was essential to being a good physician. Cito tuto jucunde (meaning to treat his patients \\"swiftly, safely, and sweetly\\") was a motto that he followed.Jack Edward McCallum \\"Military Medicine: From Ancient Times to the 21st century\\" pp. 26-27 This contrasted with the behaviour of other physicians who practised during his life time who it was said had a tendency to be uncaring and have a lack of sympathy towards their patients. =Drug theory= Digestion was a primary factor in Asclepiades' drug theory. Particles of food were seen as a main cause of indigestion. If the particles of food were small, digestion would follow its normal course. However, if the particles were too big, indigestion would occur. If an illness were to occur, he believed that drugs were not the solution. His prescribed treatment was food and wine (given in appropriate amounts) followed by an enema, which would extract the improper food doing the damage. This procedure would remove the cause of illness.Scarborough, The Drug Lore of Asclepiades of Bithynia:46 Asclepiades believed that the use of drugs for cleansing was of no use - \\"all the substances were produced by the drugs themselves\\",Reference 3 but, rather, \\"Treatment consists merely of three elements: drink, food and the enema\\".Scarborough, The Drug Lore of Asclepiades of Bithynia:44 Asclepiades was heavily influenced by Pythagoreanism and the early work of Democritus on herbal powers and remedies. Pliny the Elder says of him that, ‚ÄúAbove all, he was helped by magean deceits, which prevailed to such a degree that they were strong enough to destroy confidence in all herbal remedies‚Äù and goes on to detail some of the magic powers of those plants, including two previously detailed by Democritus.J. Lindsay, The Origins of Alchemy in Graeco-Roman Egypt, p99; quoting Plinius Major, XXVI, 9 (pp18-20) =Music therapy= Asclepiades used music therapy to treat mentally ill patients in order to maintain \\"psychogenic equilibrium\\". While Asclepiades was not the first to use music therapy, he used it to treat mental illness along with other ailments including viper bites and scorpion stings. Gentle music was recommended to those in a flippant state, while those in a sombre state were encouraged with music using the Phrygian mode. He did not recommend the use of a flute in any treatments because it was considered to be too energetic and would not have a calming effect on patients. He believed that the part of the body that was affected would dance to the music and expel the pain from the body.Ana Marta Gonzalez. The Emotions and Cultural Analysis p. 1982 The medical writers Galen and Aretaeus, both of whom lived in the 2nd century AD, credited Asclepiades with being the first individual to perform an elective (non-emergency) tracheotomy. Asclepiades advocated humane treatment of mental disorders, and had insane persons freed from confinement and treated them with natural therapy, such as diet and massages. Asclepiades is considered to be a pioneer physician in psychotherapy, physical therapy and molecular medicine.

The inhabitants are known as Creusotins. Formerly a mining town, its economy is now dominated by metallurgical companies such as ArcelorMittal, Schneider Electric, and Alstom. Since the 1990s, the town has been developing its tourism credentials. Its main attraction is the Parc des Combes. The Creusot steam hammer is exposed as a tourist attraction in a square at the entrance to the town from the south. Le Creusot is also the second educational centre of the Bourgogne (after Dijon), with its IUT and the Condorcet university centre. History In 1836, iron ore mines and forges around Le Creusot were bought by Adolphe Schneider and his brother Eug√®ne Schneider. They developed a business in steel, railways, armaments, and shipbuilding. The Schneider empire developed much of the town itself, until it was much reduced in the second half of the twentieth century. It eventually became known as Schneider Electric. The steel forgings for the French nuclear power plants as well as the special alloys for the TGV trains were manufactured in Le Creusot. On 17 October 1942 the Schneider factory was targeted by the RAF in a daylight raid designated Operation Robinson. Transport About south-east of town centre is the Gare du Creusot TGV, a train station on the LGV Sud-Est line, which links the area to Paris, Lyon and beyond with high-speed rail.

Stated another way, ambivalence is the experience of having an attitude towards someone or something that contains both positively and negatively valenced components. The term also refers to situations where \\"mixed feelings\\" of a more general sort are experienced, or where a person experiences uncertainty or indecisiveness. Although attitudes tend to guide attitude-relevant behavior, those held with ambivalence tend to do so to a lesser extent. The less certain an individual is in their attitude, the more impressionable it becomes, hence making future actions less predictable and/or less decisive. Ambivalent attitudes are also more susceptible to transient information (e.g., mood), which can result in a more malleable evaluation. However, since ambivalent people think more about attitude-relevant information, they also tend to be more persuaded by (compelling) attitude- relevant information than less-ambivalent people. Explicit ambivalence may or may not be experienced as psychologically unpleasant when the positive and negative aspects of a subject are both present in a person's mind at the same time. Psychologically uncomfortable ambivalence, also known as cognitive dissonance, can lead to avoidance, procrastination, or to deliberate attempts to resolve the ambivalence. People experience the greatest discomfort from their ambivalence at the time when the situation requires a decision to be made. People are aware of their ambivalence to varying degrees, so the effects of an ambivalent state vary across individuals and situations. For this reason, researchers have considered two forms of ambivalence, only one of which is subjectively experienced as a state of conflict.  Types of attitudinal ambivalence  = Felt ambivalence = The psychological literature has distinguished between several different forms of ambivalence. One, often called subjective ambivalence or felt ambivalence, represents the psychological experience of conflict (affective manifestation), mixed feelings, mixed reactions (cognitive manifestation), and indecision (behavioral manifestation) in the evaluation of some object.Thompson, M. M., Zanna, M. P., & Griffin, D. W. (1995). Let's not be indifferent about (attitudinal) ambivalence. In R. E. Petty & J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences (pp. 361-386). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. Ambivalence is not always acknowledged by the individual experiencing it. Although, when the individual becomes aware to a varying degree, discomfort is felt, which is elicited by the conflicting attitudes about a particular stimulus. Subjective ambivalence is generally assessed using direct self- report measures regarding one's experience of conflict about the topic of interest. Because subjective ambivalence is a secondary judgment of a primary evaluation (i.e., I'm conflicted of my positive attitude towards the president), it is considered to be metacognitive. The point of these measures is to find out how much a person experiences ambivalence in a particular evaluation. Their report may be provided in a number of ways. Priester and Petty, for example, utilized a rating system where they had subjects rate the level of conflict they were experiencing on a scale from 0 (as in the subject experienced \\"no conflict at all\\") to 10 (as in the subject experienced \\"maximum conflict\\"). However, people do not like to experience the negative emotions associated with ambivalence and therefore may not acknowledge, or report, their level of conflict as accurately as possible. This makes the measure of felt ambivalence a bit less reliable than a researcher may desire. = Potential ambivalence = Another measure of ambivalence that has been developed is called objective ambivalence or potential ambivalence, which represents the simultaneous acknowledgement of both positive and negative evaluations regarding a particular stimulus. Objective ambivalence is an indirect measure of attitude conflict that allows individuals to answer questions based on more accessible aspects of their attitude and is therefore generally viewed as an advantageous means of measurement. This indirect measure does not assume that the individual has complete knowledge and/or awareness of their attitudinal conflict and helps to eliminate confounding factors that may be affecting their attitudes. Objective ambivalence is generally assessed using a method first developed by Kaplan, in which a standard bipolar attitude scale (e.g., extremely negative to extremely positive) is split into two separate scales, each independently assessing the magnitude of one valence (e.g., not at all negative to extremely negative). If a person endorses both positive and negative reactions towards the same object, then at least some objective ambivalence is present. Kaplan initially defined ambivalence as total affect (the sum of positive and negative reactions) minus polarity (the absolute difference of positive and negative reactions). For example, if objective ambivalence towards exercising was assessed using two separate 6-point scales, and a person indicated that his or her evaluation was slightly negative (e.g., 2 on a 6-point scale) and extremely positive (e.g., 6 on a 6-point scale), this person's ambivalence would be quantified by 2 times the lesser of these two evaluations (i.e., 4 in this example). _Kaplan's measure yields the formula_ : Ambivalence = L+S - (L-S)=2S Here, S represents the smaller rating or reaction (called \\"conflicting\\" reaction in the seminal paper by Priester and Petty), and L represents the larger rating or dominant reaction. However, Kaplan's measure has largely been replaced in practice by one proposed by Thompson et al. Thompson' s formula fulfills the three necessary conditions for any scale measuring ambivalence as suggested by Breckler. The three conditions are as follows: # If the larger value is maintained, while the smaller rating increases, ambivalence will increase. # If the smaller value is maintained, while the larger rating increases, ambivalence will decrease. # If both the larger and smaller values are the same, ambivalence will increase when both ratings increase (as the difference between the two will increase) or decrease as the values decrease. _Thompson et al. refined Kaplan's formula to incorporate Breckler's components:_ Ambivalence= (L+S)/2-(L-S)=1.5S -.5L = Predictors of felt ambivalence = Research has shown only a moderate correlation between felt and potential ambivalence, although, both measures are useful depending on what is being asked. Potential ambivalence is often utilized by ambivalence researchers to gather more information about diversity of attitudes across contexts. Each individual experiences the after-effects of unpleasant feelings in a different way, whether or not associated with ambivalence awareness. There are two primary moderators that link felt and potential ambivalence: simultaneous accessibility and preference for consistency. Simultaneous accessibility is when potential ambivalence depends on how quickly and uniformly conflicting evaluations come to mind. Positive and negative knowledge regarding beliefs about an attitude object are concurrently known, but not always accessible. Only when the connection of the evaluations are applicable and coinciding to awareness, does potential ambivalence result in felt ambivalence. Preference for consistency uses incentives to combine incoming stimuli with current variables in order to respond to approaching impulses. In other words, people often review past behaviors when making new decisions; if preference for consistency is high, they are more likely to ignore new information and are thus bias to past behaviors.  Dimensions of attitudinal assessment as applied to ambivalence  = One-dimensional perspective = Traditionally, attitudes were considered one-dimensional‚Äîfrom positive to negative‚Äîbut given the rise of research findings, this perspective has lost much of its value. Ambivalence studies were a primary reason that attitudinal assessments demanded a new design. Because the basic assumption of an ambivalent attitude is that it is paradoxical, a one-dimensional perspective is likely to portray faulty information. For instance, a numerical rating of zero can be produced both by someone with a love-hate relationship toward an object, and someone who is completely indifferent about that object. There is a significant difference in the behaviors and experiences of those possessing strong conflicting attitudes, compared to those who are simply neutral. This perspective is unsuitable for examining ambivalence and based on current research does not appear to accurately reflect how attitudes function and are experienced. = Two-dimensional perspective = The two-dimensional perspective separately rates positive and negative attitudes toward an attitudinal object. The relative magnitude of positive and negative rankings are recognized by this model, providing a distinction between ambivalence and indifference. By comparing the magnitude of attitudes, the two-dimensional perspective also allows for an approximation of the degree of ambivalence; similarity in the magnitude of an individual‚Äôs positive and negative attitude towards an object indicating ambivalence, and the strength of these attitudes reveals its degree. The two-dimensional view can report everything the one-dimensional perspective can, but it has the added ability to account for ambivalence. Though this model of attitude is clearly more useful for understanding and potentially assessing ambivalence than a one dimensional model it still suffers numerous paradoxes which are difficult to argue away without acknowledging that there is more contributing to one's attitudes and their stability than perceptions regarding the object alone. These issues prompt the recent emergence of multidimensional models. = Multidimensional perspective = The Multidimensional model for attitude deviates from the linear perspectives previously mentioned. Conceptually the multidimensional model can be thought of as a network of attitudinal hubs which form a web of contributions contributing to one's attitude about a particular object. Thus ones attitude toward an object is a product of the attitudes one holds for all related objects which are activated consciously or unconsciously when considering the object in question, and is not simply an attribution regarding the object alone in a vacuum. Ambivalence occurs when there are near equal weight of contributions of both positive and negative sources according to this perspective. Note in this view the ambivalent attitude is not tied directly to the object but rather the near equivalence of positive and negative contributing attitudes. This model is very useful for understanding why attitude towards an object can fluctuate often within a relatively short span. If this model is accurate than a change in the degree of activation of particular objects related to the attitudinal object in question will alter the degree to which they contribute their attitudinal influence towards one's current attitude regarding the object in question. This allows for variance in attitude towards an object without requiring any permanent change in one's beliefs regarding neither the object nor the objects related to it. According to this model one's attitude towards eating a high calorie dessert food would likely become more positive during times when an individual is hungry, as the centers associated with the satiation property of food are now more active and contributing more influence to the attitude regarding consuming the dessert. The other contributing attitudes do not need to have been suppressed (though they can be) for the temporary change in attitude all that is required, is an increase in the output of one contributor. Continued or repeated activation of the same related objects to a given attitudinal object will likely be reinforced and over time lend more stability to the attitude, and are likely to diminish the activation of those objects not strongly activated; however, the contributing objects are themselves also subject to changes in attitudes regarding them, so no final resolution of stability will necessarily occur. In addition if the same conflicting attitudinal contributors are continuing to ‚Äúfire together‚Äù they will both be reinforced and thus may not contribute towards the resolution of ambivalence. = Meta-cognitive model = Not all attitude objects are linked to both positive and negative relations. This model is built on the idea that meta-cognition has to do with \\"knowing about knowing.\\" The process works if someone has the knowledge about cognition and is also able to control their thoughts. An evaluation creates initial thoughts that are then analyzed by a secondary thought which may vary in strength toward an assessment. Once an evaluation is obtained, the strength of the validity affects how the interpretation is perceived. If a successful univalent attitude is achieved, final evaluations are labelled as either true or false based on varying degrees of confidence.Petty, P.E., Brinol, P., DeMarree, K. (2007). The meta-cognitive model of attitudes: Implications for Attitude measurement, change, and strength. Social Cognition.Vol 25, No. 5, 662, p.657-686.  Consistency theories and ambivalence  = Overview = Cognitive consistency theories were established on the premise that individuals prefer dependable and coherent cognition. Inconsistency in one's thoughts, feelings, emotions, values, beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors causes tension. In the past, consistency theorists focused primarily on the instinctive drive to reduce this psychological discomfort and return to a simple, balanced state. Unlike classical approaches, however, theories of attitudinal ambivalence are more concerned with the perceived paradoxical state itself. = Balance theory = Fritz Heider established the first approach in the growing family of consistency theories; balance theory seeks to understand one's thoughts regarding their personal relationship with others and with the environment. Triadic relationships are used to evaluate the structure and quality of attitudes within a given arrangement. Social ties, for example, can be analyzed in terms of an individual's perception of the relationships between his or her self (p), another person (o), and the topic (e.g., issue, belief, value, object) of focus (x). According to Heider, a balanced triangle is accomplished when all three links are positive, or two are negative and one is positive (since a positive number is still achieved). The overall assumption of balance theory is rooted in the philosophy that unbalanced states have a tendency to wreak havoc. Satisfying relationships require balance, otherwise, it is not uncommon to experience consequences like stress, tension, or ambivalence. = Evaluative-cognitive consistency theory = Evaluative-cognitive consistency theory refers to a condition in which one holds opposing attitudes towards an object that are not of equal magnitude; the focus is the overall difference in evaluations, with no regard to magnitude. ‚ÄúAmbivalence is a function of the amount of conflict within an attitude, whereas evaluative-cognitive consistency is a function of the magnitude of the difference between evaluations.‚Äù In a set of dimension scores, for example, positive 5 and negative 5 have the same degree of consistency as does the set of positive 9 and negative 1. Yet, the degree of ambivalence in each set is vastly different. This distinction is important when examining the implications and effects of ambivalence, since seemingly similar ratings are in fact quite different. The two-dimensional perspective of attitudinal assessment can distinguish between ambivalence and evaluative- cognitive consistency. As ratings increase, both ambivalence and evaluative- cognitive consistency have a tendency to be less stable and less effective at predicting behavior. Past studies have linked ambivalent mental states to slower response times (due to low accessibility) and mild attitudes, although theories of evaluative-cognitive consistency have yet to report such findings. = Cognitive dissonance theory = The feeling of discomfort that results from inconsistent cognition is a powerful determinant of human behavior. The emergence of research on intellectual tension dates back to the mid-20th century, and has been a hot topic in social psychology ever since. In 1957, Leon Festinger was the first to investigate the phenomenon, thereupon coining the theory of cognitive dissonance. Festinger and other early psychologists held the notion that cognitive dissonance was the result of any two conflicting thoughts or opinions. Currently, however, research has proven that not all cognitive inconsistencies are equally upsetting, for it is not necessarily the dissonance itself that causes strife, rather, it is the individuals construct of the given contention. Dissonance, then, is characterized as a discrepancy between an attitude held by an individual and the actual behavior that is practiced by that individual, whereas ambivalence is seen as having a disparity within the attitude itself. Though unique, the ambivalent state, still, is closely connected to dissonance theory, being its most common product. Individuals seek to satisfy a stable and positive self- image. For this reason, the greatest tension is encountered when there is an incongruity between who one thinks they are and their actual behavior. Such threats to self-esteem evoke motivation to rid oneself of the distress. According to present research, there are three widely accepted methods to reduce cognitive dissonance: # Justify the behavior by changing the dissonant cognition # Justify the behavior by adding new cognitions # Change the behavior to meet the dissonant cognition  Motivation and information processing  As noted above, the desire to maintain one's preconceived notions can have vast implications. Studies have shown it is not uncommon for people to distort reality while attempting reduce ambivalence. The manner by which one chooses to replace unwanted thoughts is mostly an unconscious process, yet several factors influence the ability and likelihood of doing so. = Heuristic-systematic model = Information processing for ambivalent attitudes is less efficient and takes longer than processing of attitudes that are relatively univalent. The information is less accessible, so it takes longer for a person to integrate multiple viewpoints regarding an attitude object into one cohesive opinion or judgement.Conner, M., & Armitage, C. J. (2008). Attitudinal ambivalence. In W. D. Crano & R. Prislin (Eds.), Attitudes and attitude change (pp. 261-286). New York, NY: Psychology Press. The lack of accessibility here does serve to reduce a biased thought process. Yet, since it takes a greater amount of effort to resolve two conflicting attitudes, if one desires to form a conclusion, a more extensive thought process is necessary.  Antecedents of ambivalence  = Behavioral indicators = Researchers have sought to understand the relationship between objective and subjective ambivalence. Thompson and his colleagues argue that people with positive and negative evaluations which are of similar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -3) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are of dissimilar magnitude (e.g., +4 and -1). Similarly, they argue that even with relatively similar positive and negative evaluations, people whose evaluations are more extreme (e.g., +6 and -5) should experience more ambivalence than people whose evaluations are less extreme (e.g., +2 and -1). _The Griffin formula, also known as the similarity-intensity model_ : Ambivalence = (P + N) / 2 - P-N Here, P and N are the magnitude of positive and negative reactions, respectively. Some research has stated that as the relative contribution of dominant reactions decreases, the magnitude of conflicting reactions increases. Other studies have found that objective ambivalence predicts subjective ambivalence to a greater extent when both the positive and negative reactions are accessible, or when a decision about the attitude object is imminent. Still, more evidence has demonstrated that objective ambivalence is not the only precursor to subjective ambivalence. For example, interpersonal ambivalence, the presence of attitudes which are in conflict with those of important others, independently predicts subjective ambivalence, as does the mere anticipation of information which may conflict with one's preexisting attitude. Both personal and circumstantial aspects must be considered in order to accurately assess relationship sustainability between subjective and objective ambivalence. = Individual differences = Individual characteristics are essential in deciding the most beneficial coping strategies. Research has shown that certain personality traits may impact an individuals likelihood of experiencing ambivalence. There are certain personality traits that aren't as relevant to ambivalence, such as the need for closure. Other components may alter these traits that may contribute toward ambivalence, such as tolerance to ambiguity. Particularly, those possessing the need for cognition, or the inclination to evaluate the discrepancies between positive and negative emotions, are less likely to experience ambivalence. In other words, the desire to resolve issues, which requires a great deal of cognitive resources, fosters cognitive strength and thus the ability to overcome ambivalence. Ambivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in non congruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes. Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing. Individuals with a greater concern for invalidity experience a heightened amount of ambivalence, presumably because they are concerned with making wrongful judgments, and as a result, efforts to adjust attitude become inhibited. Response to ambivalence, then, is affected by an individual's need for consistency; hence, the higher the need for consistency, the more adverse the reaction will be to maintaining two contradictory attitudes simultaneously, whereas someone with a reduced need for consistency will experience less mental frustration Those seeking to rectify inconsistencies and resolve conflict are able to reject ambivalence better than most. Additionally, some individuals have a more pronounced fear of invalidity than others. When this fear is experienced to a stronger degree, these individuals will not want to acknowledge the ambivalence as it is especially uncomfortable. Since the ambiguity is not being resolved, it will persist within the person. Gebauer, Maio, and Pakizeh discuss the possibility that many perfectionists, despite the seemingly positive qualities exerted, are at risk of neglecting internal inconsistencies. Consequently, it is not unlikely for those individuals to confront a plethora of unexplained, ambivalent feelings. = Goal conflicts = Ambivalence will emerge when two (or more) goals valued by an individual are in conflict regarding the same attitudinal object. The individual becomes ambivalent about the object to which they both reference, not as much when regarding the individual goals themselves. Many decisions as common as food consumption or selection can invoke some degree of ambivalence every day. An action can seem to have pleasant outcomes, but it can simultaneously cause issues as well. Emotions or attitudes that are ambivalent may spark both quick and far-off consequences that are inconsistent. A chronic dieter, for example, may experience ambivalence between the goals of eating enjoyment and weight control. Each of these goals independently are viewed as positive, but when conjoined in regards to actually eating more food, the resulting conflict prompts ambivalence. The object of eating enjoyment and the object of losing weight are both regarded with positive attitude, but these two goals are incongruent with each other and are both activated when considering eating. The goal driven ambivalence that produces several forms of behavior modification may have profound implications on the behaviors and outcomes. Some examples are overcoming addiction, procrastination, health maintenance, and many others. Much of the focus of previous work has been concentrated on pain avoidance and pleasure seeking (focus on the ambivalent object itself), and not enough to the \\"pleasure\\" goal objectives related to and driving the conflict. Under certain circumstances, people who are exposed to unpleasant experiences are motivated to decrease unpleasant feelings toward ambivalence. One way to accomplish such a task is by acquiring new knowledge that can result in more immediate conclusions about the attitude object, or result in an adjustment in the individuals attitudes regarding the contributing goals which prompted the conflict. Ambivalent attitudes that demonstrate weakness are accessed slower than strong attitudes and are thought to have less of an influence on behavior. This leads to a conflict called response competition; the process of slowing down responses because of the difficulty to choose between positive and negative beliefs and feelings. Bottom-up processing shows how greater cognitive effort entwined with combined beliefs results in incongruent information. Once individuals are confronted several choices, they are then followed by uncertain outcomes. Thus concluding that slower response times may be due to systematic processing. = Value conflicts = Ambivalence is often the result of conflict arising from personal or social values. Different cultures, and the individuals within them, have different values surrounding race, ethnicity, nationality, class, religion or beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and health status. Social constructs and perceived norms and values within a given society create contradictory feelings for many individuals. If opposing values are activated by the same object they are likely to clash upon encounter. Conflicted value items do not need to come from the same category, but to be considered a contributor of ambivalence, discordance must occur. The attitudinal object of women in the workplace could, for example, be affected by religious or political values. The contributing value systems are both held in positive regard but are opposed to each other in reference to the attitudinal ambivalent item. The amount of ambivalence experienced corresponds to the positive regard of each value contributing to the conflict. In other words, weakly held conflicting values should not generate as much ambivalence as strongly held values. = Affective-cognitive ambivalence = Affective ambivalence (A+/A-) refers to disparity between feelings, whereas cognitive ambivalence (C+/C-) focuses on the disagreement between beliefs. Together, the notion of affective-cognitive ambivalence (A+/C-) or (A-/C+) embodies the commonly known conundrum of ‚Äúthe heart vs. mind conflict.‚Äù When each state is in balance, the influence on attitude is equal (A+/C+). Yet, there is compelling evidence that affect tends to overpower cognition (A+/C-). That is to say, the degree of ambivalence construed at any given moment can alter the mechanisms by which one views the world. When ambivalent cognitive states become psychologically agonizing, motivation rises to eliminate distress. Under those circumstances, people generally pay more attention to information that is relevant to their ambivalent state, in particular when it is perceived as having the potential to reduce discomfort.  Consequences of ambivalence as a dimension of attitude strength  = Attitude stability = Ambivalence is often conceptualized as a negative predictor of attitude strength. That is, as an attitude becomes more ambivalent, its strength decreases. Strong attitudes are those that are stable over time, resistant to change, and predict behavior and information processing.Krosnick, J. A., & Petty, R. E. (1995). Attitude strength: An overview. In R. E. Petty & J. A. Krosnick (Eds.), Attitude strength: Antecedents and consequences (pp. 1-24). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. Studies have found that ambivalent attitudes are less stable over time, less resistant to change, and less predictive of behavior. Ambivalent attitudes are subject to change based on the concepts, feelings, or objects that are salient at the time. Since an ambivalent attitude is one in which positive and negative feelings are held simultaneously, the strength of either may wax or wane depending on what context the individual finds themselves in; different aspects of an attitude may be activated across situations. = Attitude pliability = Ambivalent attitudes are known to be susceptible to persuasion. Since there is less certainty associated with an ambivalent attitude, both facts and trivial information are assessed, assimilated, and determinant of one's attitude. Accordingly, this may bias or persuade an individual's attitude. Strong attitudes, on the other hand, are less likely to be manipulated because they are essentially \\"anchored in knowledge structures\\". Armitage and Conner conducted a study regarding attitudes toward eating a low- fat diet. Attitudes of a high ambivalence group and a low ambivalence group were recorded two times within five months. Following an attitude change intervention the high ambivalence group demonstrated a significant positive change in attitude toward the diet (compared to a control group) whereas the low ambivalence group demonstrated very little change if any. In situations that highlight one dimension over the other, individuals who are high in ambivalence are more likely to embrace the clear-cut better aspect of the attitude object.  Ambivalence in clinical psychology  = Bleuler's tripartite scheme = The concept of ambivalence was introduced into psychiatric parlance by Eugen Bleuler, who used it in print for the first time in his 1910 article Vortrag √ºber Ambivalenz.P. Gay, Freud (1989) p. 198 Bleuler distinguished three main types of ambivalence: volitional, intellectual, and emotional.Angela Richards ed, Sigmund Freud, On Metapsychology (PFL 11) p. 128n. Volitional ambivalence refers to an inability to decide on an action‚Äîwhat Montaigne called \\"a spirit justly balanced betweene two equal desires\\".Montaigne, Essays Vol II (1938) p. 333. The concept (if not Bleuler's term) had a long prehistory, reaching back through Buridan's ass, starving between two equally attractive bales of hay in the Middle Ages, to Aristotle.Dante, Paradise (1975) p. 81-6. Intellectual ambivalence‚Äîthe sceptical belief that \\"There is no reason but hath a contrary to it\\"Montaigne, Essays Vol II (1938) p. 334 ‚Äîalso follows a long tradition reaching back through Montaigne to Sextus Empiricus and Pyrrho.J. Boardman ed, The Oxford History of the Classical World (1991) p. 715-6 and p. 842. (Freud considered Bleuler's stress on intellectual ambivalence particularly appropriate given his own ambivalence towards Freud's intellectual constructs, alternatively praising and criticizing them).E. Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (1964) p. 354 Emotional ambivalence involved opposing affective attitudes towards the same object, as with the man who both loved and hated his wife.J. Bleger et al, Symbiosis and Ambiguity (2013) p. 246. While mainly dealing with ambivalence in relation to the psychological splitting of schizophrenia, Bleuler also noted how \\"in the dreams of healthy persons, affective as well as intellectual ambivalence is a common phenomenon\\".J. Bleger et al, Symbiosis and Ambiguity (2013) p. 247 = Freudian usage = Freud was swift to pick up Bleuler's concept of ambivalence, applying it to areas he had previously dealt with in terms of ambiguous language,J. Bleger et al, Symbiosis and Ambiguity (2013) p. 251 or the persistent co-existence of love and hatred aimed at the same person.S. Freud, Case Studies II (PFL 9) p. 118‚Äì9 Freud also extended the scope of Bleuler's term to cover the co- existence of active and passive trends in the same instinctual impulseJ. Bleger et al, Symbiosis and Ambiguity (2013) p. 261‚Äîwhat Freud called \\"pairs of contrary component instincts\\" such as looking and being looked at.S. Freud, Case Studies II (PFL 9) p. 256 Karl Abraham explored the presence of ambivalence in mourning‚Äîsomething he thought to be a universal phenomenon.D. Leader, The New Black (2008) p. 61‚Äì6 Others in psychoanalysis have traced the roots of contradictory impulses (usually love and hate) to very early stages of psychosexual development.Erik H. Erikson, Childhood and Society (1973) p. 72‚Äì6 Defences against feeling both of the two contradictory emotions include psychological repression, isolation and displacement.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) p. 157 and p. 198 Thus, for example, an analytic patient's love for his father might be quite consciously experienced and openly expressed‚Äîwhile his \\"hate\\" for the same object might be heavily repressed and only indirectly expressed, and thus only revealed in analysis. A drug addict may feel ambivalently about their drug of choice; they are aware of their drug use as a negative-impact agent in their lives (socially, financially, physically, etc.) while simultaneously seeking and using the drug because of the positive-impact results they receive from the drug's usage (the \\"high\\"). (More recent discourse of addiction as a mental health concern and chemically-induced/encoded imperative, rather than as a behavioral choice, complicates the notion of ambivalence as it relates to addiction.) Another relevant distinction is that whereas the psychoanalytic notion of \\"ambivalence\\" sees it as engendered by all neurotic conflict, a person's everyday \\"mixed feelings\\" may easily be based on a quite realistic assessment of the imperfect nature of the thing being considered. Ambivalence in philosophy Philosophers such as Hili Razinsky consider how ambivalence relates to other aspects of the human experience, such as personhood, action, and judgement, and what it means that strict ambivalence is possible.

It was the seat of the Tsugaru clan, a 47,000 koku tozama daimy≈ç clan who ruled over Hirosaki Domain, Mutsu Province, in what is now central Hirosaki, Aomori Prefecture, Japan. It was also referred to as . Background Hirosaki Castle measures 612 meters east-west and 947 meters north-south. Its grounds are divided into six concentric baileys, which were formerly walled and separated by moats. It is unusual in that its Edo period tenshu and most of its outline remains intact. Noted historian and author Shiba Ry≈çtar≈ç praised it as one of the \\"Seven Famous Castles of Japan\\" in his travel essay series Kaid≈ç wo Yuku.  History  During the late Sengoku period, former Nambu retainer ≈åura Tamenobu was awarded revenues of 45,000 koku by Toyotomi Hideyoshi for his role in the Battle of Odawara in 1590. He took the family name of Tsugaru at that time. At the Battle of Sekigahara, he sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu and was subsequently confirmed as lord of Hirosaki Domain with revenues increased to 47,000 koku. In 1603, he began work on a castle in Hirosaki; however, work was suspended with his death in Kyoto in 1604. Work was resumed by his successor, Tsugaru Nobuhira in 1609, who stripped Horikoshi Castle and ≈åura Castle of buildings and materials in order to speed its completion. The current castle was completed in 1611. However, in 1627, the 5-story tenshu was struck by lightning and destroyed by fire. It was not rebuilt until 1810 when the present 3-story structure was erected, but at the southeast corner, rather than the original southwest location. It was built by the 9th daimy≈ç, Tsugaru Yasuchika. With the Meiji Restoration and subsequent abolition of the han system, the Tsugaru clan surrendered the castle to the new Meiji government. In 1871, the castle was garrisoned by a detachment of the Imperial Japanese Army, and in 1873 the palace structures, martial arts school and most of the castle walls were pulled down. In 1894, the castle properties were donated by the Tsugaru clan to the government for use as a park, which opened to the general public the following year. In 1898, an armory was established in the former Third Bailey by the IJA 8th Division. In 1906, two of the remaining yagura burned down. In 1909, a four-meter-tall bronze statue of Tsugaru Tamenobu was erected on the site of the tenshu. In 1937, eight structures of the castle received protection from the government as ‚Äúnational treasures‚Äù. However, in 1944, during the height of World War II, all of the bronze in the castle, including roof tiles and decorations, were stripped away for use in the war effort. In 1950, under the new cultural properties protection system, all surviving structures in the castle (with the exception of the East Gate of the Third Bailey) were named National Important Cultural Properties (ICP). In 1952, the grounds received further protection with their nomination as a National Historic Site. Agency for Cultural Affairs In 1953, after reconstruction, the East Gate of the Third Bailey also gained ICP status, giving a total of nine structures within the castle with such protection. Extensive archaeological excavations from 1999-2000 revealed the foundations of the former palace structures and a Shinto shrine. In 2006, Hirosaki Castle was listed as one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation. In order to repair the castle's stone walls directly below the tenshu, the entire tenshu was removed in autumn 2015, and will be returned to its original position in 2021.ÂºòÂâçÂüéÁü≥Âû£‰øÆÁêÜ‰∫ãÊ•≠„Å®„ÅØ - Hirosaki Castle official website(02/13/2020). Structures and gardens Hirosaki Castle Keep Tower The current tenshu of the castle was completed in 1811. It is a three-story building with three roofs, and a height of 14.4 meters. The design is smaller than early Edo-period varieties of tenshu, and it was built on a corner of the inner bailey on the site of a yagura, rather than the stone base of the original tenshu. The small size was partly due to the restricted finances of the domain towards the end of the Edo period, but its location and design were also intended to alleviate concerns which might be raised by the Tokugawa shogunate should a larger structure be built. At present, it is a separate standing structure; however, prior to 1896 it had an attached gatehouse. The tenshu is surrounded by three surviving yagura from the Edo period (the Ninomaru Tatsumi Yagura, Ninomaru Hitsujisaru Yagura, Ninomaru Ushitora Yagura), on its second bailey, and five surviving gates (Sannomaru ≈åtemon Gate, Sannomaru East Gate, Ninomaru South Gate, Ninomaru East Gate, Kitanokuruwa North Gate) in the walls of its second and third baileys. All of these structures, including the tenshu itself, are National Important Cultural Properties. The surrounding Hirosaki Park around the castle grounds is one of Japan's most famous cherry blossom spots. Over a million people enjoy the park's 2600 trees (which were originally planted around in grounds in 1903) during the sakura matsuri (cherry blossom festival) when the cherry blossoms are in bloom, usually during the Japanese Golden Week holidays in the end of April and beginning of May.

The 2013 Federal sequester would have resulted in the closure of the airport's control tower, but the Federal Aviation Administration ultimately reversed its decision.http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/10/politics/travel-faa- towers/ History The first airline flights at Dubuque were Mid-Continent DC-3s in 1950. In 1955 successor Braniff was replaced by Ozark, which pulled out its DC9s and FH227s in 1981. Northwest Airlines announced on February 7, 2008 that its regional partner Mesaba Airlines (Northwest Airlink) would return to Dubuque with twice daily Saab 340s to Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. These flights began on June 20, 2008. On July 2, 2009 the merged Delta/Northwest Airlines announced it would end service to Dubuque, leaving DBQ with one airline. Facilities Dubuque Regional Airport covers 1,240 acres (502 ha) at an elevation of 1,077 feet (328 m). It has two concrete runways: 18/36 is 6,327 by 150 feet (1,928 x 46 m) and 13/31 is 6,502 by 100 feet (1,982 x 30 m). In the year ending September 30, 2017 the airport had 50,301 aircraft operations, average 138 per day: 96% general aviation, 4% air taxi, <1% military and <1% airline. In September 2017, 63 aircraft were based at the airport: 52 single-engine, 9 multi-engine, 2 jet and 1 helicopter. The University of Dubuque has a flight operations center at the airport that provides for pilot training in the school's aviation programs. This includes ground school and actual flight training. The University has two hangars for their aircraft and a third hangar that is shared. The terminal has free Wi-Fi internet access. The airport recently installed enclosed walkways at the gates, allowing passengers to walk to the planes without going outdoors. The terminal has an ATM, vending machines, and gaming machines. On June 22, 2018 the airport lost its restaurant (The Hangar Bar & Grille), due to American Airlines reducing its flights at the airport. The terminal has three gates for airline passengers and a jet bridge. The terminal has a baggage carousel, desks for three airlines, and rental car services including Avis and Hertz. Airline and destination =Passenger= American Eagle ERJ-145s fly to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago three times a day. Safety The airport has been recognized by the Federal Aviation Administration a number of times for its commitment to safety. It won the FAA's \\"Airport Safety Enhancement Award\\" in 1994, 1997, 2000, and 2003. In order to receive this honor, an airport must be free from discrepancies during an inspection for three consecutive years. In 2008, the Dubuque Regional Airport marked 18 consecutive years of perfect safety inspections in accordance with FAR Part 139. That record is unmatched among the approximately 600 certified U.S. airports. =Incidents and Accidents= * On December 24, 1982 Piper PA-31 Navajo N4091U crashed on a back course approach to Runway 13 due to low visibility. The pilot and passenger were killed. * On April 19, 1993 a Mitsubishi MU-2B-60 N86SD, owned by the state of South Dakota, suffered a catastrophic failure of the propeller hub on its left engine and crashed, while on approach, south of the community of Zwingle, IA. The crash killed all 8 on board including the governor of South Dakota, George S. Mickelson. * On October 23, 2001 Beechcraft Baron 58 N7235R arriving from DuPage Airport crashed while on approach to Runway 31 due to ground fog. One fatality occurred. * On March 8, 2004 Cessna 172R N105FS stalled after ice accumulated on the wings, causing a hard impact on landing. Three minor injuries were reported. * On April 3, 2011 AmericanConnection flight 5019 bound to O'Hare International Airport sustained substantial damage after the jet bridge was blown into the side of the plane. Winds were gusting to 27 kts, and the emergency brakes in the jet bridge failed to activate. There were no injuries, and the aircraft was repaired and returned to service. * On October 13, 2014 Piper PA-46 N9126V crashed on approach to the airport. As of October 18, 2014 it is unclear why the plane crashed, though low visibility was reported. One fatality occurred. Expansion To update facilities and accommodate growth, the City of Dubuque announced plans in 2007 to build a new, larger terminal building. The new $23 million facility is part of the airport's master improvement plan; it opened on June 9, 2016. The city has expressed interest in courting more airlines. Until recently, Dubuque Regional had up to three air carriers. Two were eliminated when the airline industry met hard times after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. American Airlines they would drop their flights in October, 2018 due to financial difficulties and lower demand.https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/20/coronavirus-travel-american- airlines-halting-service-to-15-small-cities-after-federal-aid-runs-out.html See also * Dubuque, Iowa * List of airports in Iowa References External links * Dubuque Regional Airport, official website * Aerial image as of April 1994 from USGS The National Map  https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR9308.pdf Category:Airports in Iowa Category:Buildings and structures in Dubuque, Iowa Category:Transportation in Dubuque, Iowa Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Dubuque County, Iowa ","title":"Dubuque Regional Airport"},{"id":"2071166","text":"thumb The holy places of Ayyavazhi includes the following Primary Pathis # Swamithope pathi # Ambala Pathi # Mutta Pathi # Thamaraikulam Pathi # Poo Pathi Other Pathis # Vaikunda pathi # Vakai Pathi # Avathara Pathi Primary Thangals # Chettikudiyiruppu # Agastheeswaram # Paloor # Sundavilai # Vadalivilai # Kadambankulam # Pambankulam Other Important Thangals # Vellai Chuvamiyar Pathi # Veppankattu Pathi # Pazhavar # Sidambara puram # Kalakkadu # Thysaiyan Vilai Other holy sites # Vaikunda Malai # Marunthuvazh Malai See also *List of Ayyavazhi-related articles *Pancha pathi *History of Ayyavazhi References * R.

Bessel filters are often used in audio crossover systems. The filter's name is a reference to German mathematician Friedrich Bessel (1784‚Äì1846), who developed the mathematical theory on which the filter is based. The filters are also called Bessel‚ÄìThomson filters in recognition of W. E. Thomson, who worked out how to apply Bessel functions to filter design in 1949.Thomson, W.E., \\"Delay Networks having Maximally Flat Frequency Characteristics\\", Proceedings of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, Part III, November 1949, Vol. 96, No. 44, pp. 487‚Äì490. (In fact, a paper by Kiyasu of Japan predates this by several years.) The Bessel filter is very similar to the Gaussian filter, and tends towards the same shape as filter order increases. While the time-domain step response of the Gaussian filter has zero overshoot, the Bessel filter has a small amount of overshoot, but still much less than common frequency domain filters. Compared to finite-order approximations of the Gaussian filter, the Bessel filter has better shaping factor, flatter phase delay, and flatter group delay than a Gaussian of the same order, though the Gaussian has lower time delay and zero overshoot.  The transfer function  A plot of the gain and group delay for a fourth-order low pass Bessel filter. Note that the transition from the pass band to the stop band is much slower than for other filters, but the group delay is practically constant in the passband. The Bessel filter maximizes the flatness of the group delay curve at zero frequency. A Bessel low-pass filter is characterized by its transfer function: :H(s) = \\\\frac{\\\\theta_n(0)}{\\\\theta_n(s/\\\\omega_0)}\\\\, where \\\\theta_n(s) is a reverse Bessel polynomial from which the filter gets its name and \\\\omega_0 is a frequency chosen to give the desired cut-off frequency. The filter has a low-frequency group delay of 1 / \\\\omega_0. Since \\\\theta_n (0) is indeterminate by the definition of reverse Bessel polynomials, but is a removable singularity, it is defined that \\\\theta_n (0) = \\\\lim_{x \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\theta_n (x) . Bessel polynomials poles of filter transfer function in the s plane, here plotted as crosses. The transfer function of the Bessel filter is a rational function whose denominator is a reverse Bessel polynomial, such as the following: :n=1; \\\\quad s+1 :n=2; \\\\quad s^2+3s+3 :n=3; \\\\quad s^3+6s^2+15s+15 :n=4; \\\\quad s^4+10s^3+45s^2+105s+105 :n=5; \\\\quad s^5+15s^4+105s^3+420s^2+945s+945 The reverse Bessel polynomials are given by: :\\\\theta_n(s)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n a_ks^k, where :a_k=\\\\frac{(2n-k)!}{2^{n-k}k!(n-k)!} \\\\quad k=0,1,\\\\ldots,n.  Example  Gain plot of the third-order Bessel filter, versus normalized frequency Group delay plot of the third-order Bessel filter, illustrating flat unit delay in the passband The transfer function for a third-order (three-pole) Bessel low-pass filter with \\\\omega_0 = 1 is :H(s)=\\\\frac{15}{s^3+6s^2+15s+15}, where the numerator has been chosen to given unity gain at zero frequency (s = 0).The roots of the denominator polynomial, the filter's poles, include a real pole at , and a complex-conjugate pair of poles at , plotted above. The gain is then :G(\\\\omega) = H(j\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{15}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\omega^6+6\\\\omega^4+45\\\\omega^2+225}}. \\\\, The 3-dB point, where H(j\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}\\\\sqrt{2}, \\\\, occurs at \\\\omega = 1.756. \\\\, This is conventionally called the cut-off frequency. The phase is :\\\\phi(\\\\omega)=-\\\\arg(H(j\\\\omega))= \\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\frac{15\\\\omega-\\\\omega^3}{15-6\\\\omega^2}\\\\right). \\\\, The group delay is :D(\\\\omega)=-\\\\frac{d\\\\phi}{d\\\\omega} = \\\\frac{6 \\\\omega^4+ 45 \\\\omega^2+225}{\\\\omega^6+6\\\\omega^4+45\\\\omega^2+225}. \\\\, The Taylor series expansion of the group delay is :D(\\\\omega) = 1-\\\\frac{\\\\omega^6}{225}+\\\\frac{\\\\omega^8}{1125}+\\\\cdots. Note that the two terms in œâ2 and œâ4 are zero, resulting in a very flat group delay at . This is the greatest number of terms that can be set to zero, since there are a total of four coefficients in the third order Bessel polynomial, requiring four equations in order to be defined. One equation specifies that the gain be unity at and a second specifies that the gain be zero at , leaving two equations to specify two terms in the series expansion to be zero. This is a general property of the group delay for a Bessel filter of order n: the first terms in the series expansion of the group delay will be zero, thus maximizing the flatness of the group delay at .  Digital  As the important characteristic of a Bessel filter is its maximally-flat group delay, and not the amplitude response, it is inappropriate to use the bilinear transform to convert the analog Bessel filter into a digital form (since this preserves the amplitude response but not the group delay). The digital equivalent is the Thiran filter, also an all-pole low-pass filter with maximally-flat group delay, which can also be transformed into an allpass filter, to implement fractional delays.

He served as Chief Judge from September 30, 2000, to September 30, 2006, when he assumed senior status.Daniel Wise, Walker to Assume Senior Status; Law Professor Tapped, N.Y. Law Journal, June 30, 2006 Accessed August 6, 2013. He was a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, appointed in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan before being elevated to the Second Circuit in 1989. Personal Walker was born in New York City. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1958, and received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University in 1962. He received his Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1966. Walker is married to Katharine K. Walker, has a daughter and three stepsons, and lives in Madison, Connecticut. He is the son of Dr. John M. Walker and Elsie Louise Mead. His uncle is George Herbert Walker Jr., co-founder of the New York Mets. He is a first cousin of United States President George H. W. Bush, the two having a grandfather in common, George Herbert Walker. His father's sister, Dorothy, was the mother of the 41st President. He is also a first cousin once removed (common paternal uncle), of President George W. Bush and his brother, former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush. Early career Walker served in the Marine Corps Reserves from 1963 until 1968.Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, Ronald Reagan: \\"Nomination of John M. Walker Jr., To Be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury,\\" The American Presidency Project, May 13, 1981 Accessed August 6, 2013. From 1966 until 1968, he was State Counsel to the Republic of Botswana, sponsored by an Africa-Asia Public Service Fellowship, where he drafted a codification of tribal law and was the country's principal prosecutor in the regular (non-tribal) criminal courts. Walker was in private practice in New York City from 1969 to 1970. From 1970 to 1975 he served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Criminal Division in the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, where he prosecuted drugs and business fraud cases. In 1975 he returned to private law practice with the New York firm of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, where he was a partner in commercial litigation. In 1981 Walker became Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, responsible for policy in law enforcement, regulatory, and trade matters, and with oversight of the Customs Service, Secret Service, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control. As Assistant Secretary, he helped establish the Iran‚ÄìUnited States Claims Tribunal and served as a U.S. representative to Interpol. He led the development of Treasury's drug interdiction and financial enforcement programs. He also oversaw the Treasury's review of Secret Service operations following the attempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan. Among the shortcomings of the Secret Service that the review identified and remedied were inadequate reserve personnel and the use of unencrypted radio communications. For his Treasury service, Walker received the Alexander Hamilton Award, Treasury's highest award. His work caught the attention of New York Senator Alphonse D'Amato who supported him for the position of district judge. Judicial career Walker was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on June 25, 1985, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by Judge Morris E. Lasker. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 19, 1985, and received commission on July 22, 1985. His service terminated on December 19, 1989, due to elevation to the Second Circuit. He was succeeded by Judge Sonia Sotomayor. As a district judge, Walker presided over a variety of civil and criminal proceedings, including notably the 1989 tax fraud trial of billionaire hotel magnate Leona Helmsley, whom he sentenced to four years in jail. Walker was nominated by President George H. W. Bush on September 21, 1989, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated by Judge Irving Kaufman. He was confirmed by the Senate on November 22, 1989, and received his commission on November 27, 1989. He served as Chief Judge from September 30, 2000 to September 30, 2006. He assumed senior status on September 30, 2006. He was succeeded by Judge Debra Ann Livingston. Walker was awarded the Learned Hand Medal for \\"excellence in Federal Jurisprudence\\" by the Federal Bar Council\\"Learned Hand Award Established by the Federal Bar Council in 1962\\" Federal Bar Council Accessed August 12, 2013. and in 2006 the Robert L. Haig Award for \\"distinguished public service\\" by the New York State Bar Association, and the J. Edward Lumbard Award for \\"outstanding service\\" by the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney's Office. =Judicial administration= Walker has served as Special Counsel to the U.S. Administrative Conference (1987‚Äì1992) and president of the Federal Judges' Association (1993‚Äì1995). As chief judge, Walker was engaged with all three levels of federal court administration. He led the Court of Appeals, chaired the Second Circuit Judicial Council with responsibility for all of the courts within the Second Circuit (consisting of the states of Connecticut, New York, and Vermont), and on the national level was a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States, chaired by the Chief Justice of the United States (2000-2006). He was also selected by Chief Justice William Rehnquist to be a member of the Conference's Executive Committee (2003-2006) and its Budget Committee (1990-1999). He was selected by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., to be a member of its Committee on International Judicial Relations (2006-2012), and to be the Chair of the Conference's Committee on Judicial Conduct and Disability (2009-2013). As Chief Judge of the Second Circuit, Walker managed the dislocations from the courthouse at 40 Foley Square in lower Manhattan caused by the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001, oversaw the establishment by Judge Jon O. Newman of a separate calendar for a sudden crush of 5,000 immigration appeals in 2005, and obtained funding for the total renovation of the Thurgood Marshall Courthouse at 40 Foley Square which was completed under the supervision of Chief Judge Walker and his successor, Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs. =Court cases= Walker has authored several hundred decisions in various areas of federal law including influential precedents in the areas of constitutional law, criminal law, criminal and civil procedure, securities law, bankruptcy law, intellectual property law, and international law, including the following selected appeals. Constitutional law * National Abortion Federation v. Gonzales, 437 F.3d 278, 296 (2d Cir. 2006) (Walker, C.J., concurring). In a concurring opinion, Walker criticized the evidentiary standard adopted by the Supreme Court in Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914 (2000), which allowed facial challenges against abortion laws to succeed with only speculative showings that the challenged regulations might work an unconstitutional result. This standard, Walker observed, was \\"both unclear and difficult\\" for lower courts \\"to apply with any certainty\\" and left legislatures without sufficient constitutional guidance on how challenges could be made against their enactments. Justice Anthony Kennedy cited Walker's reasoning approvingly in Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124 (2007), which distinguished Stenberg and upheld the constitutionality of the federal partial-birth abortion statute enacted by Congress in 2003. *Rweyemamu v.

Judicial philosophy Walker is a strong advocate of judicial independence for both courts in the United States and in other countries. He has condemned the growing politicization of the judicial nomination and confirmation process for federal judges.John M. Walker Jr., \\"The Unfortunate Politicization of Judicial Confirmation Hearings\\" The Atlantic, July 9, 2012 The \\"political theater\\" that judicial nominees are subjected to in the Senate, he writes, \\"politicizes the judiciary, misrepresents the judiciary's role in our democracy, demeans highly qualified nominees, and unjustifiably delays or jettisons confirmations.\\" An independent judge, in his view, is one who faithfully applies existing law to the facts of the case at hand, giving due respect to precedent, and resists the temptation to effectively rewrite legislative enactments. The independent judge \\"must remain detached and impartial -- and free not merely from personal or financial interests\\" but also free of \\"any responsibility to party or social faction\\" and \\"must not be concerned with whether an outcome will incur public approbation or wrath.\\" Teaching and scholarship Since 2000, Walker has been a Lecturer in Law at Yale Law School, where he has taught constitutional litigation with fellow Second Circuit judges Guido Calabresi and Susan L. Carney and with district judges Mark Kravitz and Jeffrey Meyer. From 1996 to 2000, Walker was an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law and a member of NYU's Institute of Judicial Administration and Appellate Judges Seminar. He has also served on the Board of the U.S. Association of Constitutional Law since 1997 and the CEELI Institute in Prague since 2006. Rule of law initiatives Walker is actively involved in initiatives to promote the rule of law, strengthen judiciaries and foster cooperation among judges around the world, especially in Eastern and Central Europe, China and the Middle East. He was a member of the U.S. delegation to the G8 Experts Conference on the Rule of Law in Berlin in 2007.\\"Experts Conference on the Rule of Law\\" Federal Foreign Office, Germany, 2007 Accessed August 13, 2013. =Central and Eastern Europe= Walker has worked across Central and Eastern Europe to promote the development of judicial institutions in individual countries and to foster collaboration among judiciaries across the region and the United States. In 2011, he was instrumental in organizing the first Conference of the Chief Justices of Central and Eastern Europe, hosted by the CEELI Institute in Prague, which was attended by the chief justices, presidents and high officers of the supreme courts that region of the world. Chief Justice of the United States John G. Roberts, Jr. delivered the opening remarks and participated in the first conference. The Conference, now an ongoinsg institution that meets annually in a different member country, provides a unique forum for the heads of judiciaries of 24 former communist countries to share their experiences, discuss problems and offer solutions, while developing ongoing personal relationships. The Chief Justices Conference arose out of CEELI's Judicial Integrity Round Tables.CEELI Institute 2011 Annual Report Accessed August 10, 2013. In 2006, while on a trip to Hungary, Walker saw a need for closer communication among the chief justices of Central and Eastern European countries. He then led the roundtable discussions on judicial integrity among the heads of the Supreme Court in the region at the CEELI Institute in Prague in 2007 and 2010. At the 2010 roundtable, the participants expressed a desire to hold regular conferences on an ongoing basis. After the first Chief Justices Conference in 2011, Walker has represented the Ceeli Institute and remained an advisor to the Conference. He helped plan and participated in subsequent Chief Justice Conferences hosted in Albania (2012), Montenegro (2013), Georgia (2014), Croatia (2015), Serbia (2016),Hungary (2017), Lithuania (2018) and Slovakia (2019). Since 2013, the Russian Federation has actively participated in the work of the Conference. Walker began working on issues of legal reform and judicial administration in Eastern Europe in 2004 when Chief Justice of Albania Thimjo Kondi sought assistance with the administration of the Albanian judiciary. Walker made multiple trips to Albania to assist with the establishment of a judicial conference modeled upon that of the U.S. federal judiciary and to teach judicial ethics. He has discussed legal reform issues with Presidents Alfred Moisiu and Bamir Topi and prime ministers Fatos Nano and Sali Berisha.‚Äú‚ÄôJustice under pressure‚Äô, Topi: Legal conditions for correct judges verdicts‚Äù Albanian Screen, May 14, 2012 Accessed August 10, 2013. He worked with Kondi's successor, Chief Justice Shpresa Be√ßaj, to host the second Chief Justices Conference in Tirana in 2012. President Moisiu awarded Judge Walker the \\"Medal of Special Merit\\" for his work in Albania. Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Walker has discussed law reform issues with leaders in various countries where he has also given remarks and met with law school faculty and students, bar associations and judges. In 2008 he helped organize a conference on rule of law and law school accreditation in Georgia where he discussed rule of law issues with President Mikheil Saakashvili, having worked on law reform the previous year with Chief Justice of the Georgian Supreme Court Konstantin Kublashvili. =China= Since 1986, Walker has been active in rule of law programs and exchanges with China. He has participated in exchanges with Chinese judges in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Xiamen and Haikou.(Chinese) \\"ÁæéÂõΩËÅîÈÇ¶Â§ßÂå∫Ê≥ïÂÆòÁ∫¶Áø∞¬∑Ê≤ÉÂÖã‰∏ÄË°åÂà∞ÊàëÈô¢ÂèÇËßÇËÆøÈóÆ (U.S. Federal Court Judge John Walker visits our court)\\" Liaoning Shenyang Municipal Intermediate People's Court Jan. 15, 2008 Accessed August 6, 2013.

Miscellaneous Fatal traffic accident =Fatal traffic accident= On the evening of October 17, 2006, while driving home, Walker's Ford Escape automobile struck a police officer, Daniel Picagli, who was directing traffic in a rainstorm at a road construction site for AT&T; in New Haven, Connecticut. There were no construction signs or traffic cones marking off the site. Picagli died four days later on October 21, 2006. \\"He had been wearing a black raincoat and a reflective vest\\". Police Chief Francisco Ortiz said the \\"officers did not feel it was necessary to test Walker for drugs or alcohol\\". Walker stopped immediately, and New Haven police have said the cause was not related to drugs or alcohol. A police investigation reported that Walker \\"was traveling at a slow speed through the dark and rainy construction site.\\" The prosecutor declined to press charges, saying nothing indicated \\"intentional, negligent or reckless conduct\\" by Walker.

Among his works were a contribution to the ex-Communist treatise The God that Failed (1949), a Life of Mahatma Gandhi (1950), basis for the Academy Award- winning film Gandhi (1982), as well as a Life of Lenin, which won the 1965 National Book Award in History and Biography.\\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1965\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-17. Biography =Early life= Louis Fischer, the son of a fish peddler, was born in Philadelphia on 29 February 1896. After studying at the Philadelphia School of Pedagogy from 1914 to 1916, he became a school teacher. In 1917, Fischer joined the Jewish Legion, a military unit based in Palestine. On his return to the United States, Fischer took up work at a news agency in New York City and met Bertha \\"Markoosha\\" Mark (1890?-1977). In 1921, when Bertha went to work in Berlin, Fischer joined her a few months later and began contributing to the New York Evening Post as a European correspondent. The following year, he moved to Moscow and married Bertha. In 1923 their first son George was born (followed by Victor a year later) and Fisher began working for The Nation. While in the Soviet Union, Fischer published several books including Oil Imperialism: The International Struggle for Petroleum (1926) and The Soviets in World Affairs (1930). In 1934, American Max Eastman criticized Fischer for Stalinism in a chapter called \\"The 'Revolution' of April 23, 1932\\" in his book Artists in Uniform.Max Eastman, Artists in Uniform: A Study of Literature and Bureaucratism, (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1934) pp. 161-165 In 1938, Leon Trotsky described Fischer as a \\"merchant of lies\\" and \\"direct literary agent of Stalin\\".Writings of Leon Trotsky [Volume 10] (1937-1938) - L√©on Trotsky, p.266 Fischer also covered the Spanish Civil War and for a time was a member of the International Brigade fighting General Francisco Franco. In 1938, he returned to the United States and settled in New York. He continued to work for The Nation and wrote his autobiography, Men and Politics (1941). Fischer left The Nation in 1945 after a dispute with the editor, Freda Kirchwey, over the journal's sympathetic reporting of Joseph Stalin. His disillusionment with Communism, although he had never been a member of the Communist Party USA, was reflected in his contribution to The God That Failed (1949). Fischer began writing for anti-Communist liberal magazines such as The Progressive. Louis Fischer taught about the Soviet Union at Princeton University until his death on January 15, 1970. =Denial of the Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì33= Fischer traveled to Ukraine in October and November 1932, for The Nation, and was alarmed at what he saw. \\"In the Poltava, Vinnitsa, Podolia and Kiev regions, conditions will be hard,\\" he wrote, \\"I think there is no starvation anywhere in Ukraine now ‚Äî after all they have just gathered in the harvest, but it was a bad harvest.\\" Initially critical of the Soviet grain procurement program because it created the food problem, Fischer by February 1933 adopted the official Soviet government view, which blamed the problem on Ukrainian counter-revolutionary nationalist \\"wreckers.\\" It seemed \\"whole villages\\" had been \\"contaminated\\" by such men, who had to be deported to \\"lumbering camps and mining areas in distant agricultural areas which are now just entering upon their pioneering stage.\\" These steps were forced upon the Kremlin, Fischer wrote, but the Soviets were, nevertheless, learning how to rule wisely. Fischer was on a lecture tour in the United States when Gareth Jones' famine story broke. Speaking to a college audience in Oakland, California, a week later, Fischer stated emphatically: \\"There is no starvation in Russia.\\" He spent the spring of 1933 campaigning for American diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union. As rumors of a famine in the USSR reached American shores, Fischer vociferously denied the reports. =Fischer's note about Subhas Bose= In January 2009, on the occasion of the 112th birth anniversary of Subhas Chandra Bose, Italian ambassador to India Alessandro Quaroni stated that there was no point in continuing research on whether Bose died in a plane crash or not in August 1945. In a statement issued against this remark, Mission Netaji, a Delhi based non-profit trust stated that there was evidence which held that Bose did not die in any plane crash. Mission Netaji cited reference to a note by Louis Fischer, which is preserved in the Princeton University Library. The note quotes the former Italian ambassador Pietro Quaroni, father of Alessandro Quaroni, as saying that he did not think the news of Bose's accidental death was true. Fischer had met Pietro Quaroni in Moscow in November 1946 and quoted him saying it was possible \\"that Bose is still alive\\". Quaroni had told Fischer that Bose did not want the British to look for him, so the false rumor of his death was circulated.

Revision and conservation of Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc (Czech Republic) in 2006. Architectural conservation describes the process through which the material, historical, and design integrity of any built heritage are prolonged through carefully planned interventions. The individual engaged in this pursuit is known as an architectural conservator-restorer. Decisions of when and how to engage in an intervention are critical to the ultimate conservation-restoration of cultural heritage. Ultimately, the decision is value based: a combination of artistic, contextual, and informational values is normally considered. In some cases, a decision to not intervene may be the most appropriate choice. Definitions =Narrow definition= The Conservation Architect must consider factors that deal with issues of prolonging the life and preserving the integrity of architectural character, such as form and style, and/or its constituent materials, such as stone, brick, glass, metal, and wood. In this sense, the term refers to the \\"professional use of a combination of science, art, craft, and technology as a preservation tool\\"Weaver and Matero 1997, p. 1 and is allied with ‚Äì and often equated to ‚Äì its parent fields, of historic environment conservation and art conservation. =Broad definition= In addition to the design and art/science definition described above, architectural conservation also refers to issues of identification, policy, regulation, and advocacy associated with the entirety of the cultural and built environment. This broader scope recognizes that society has mechanisms to identify and value historic cultural resources, create laws to protect these resources, and develop policies and management plans for interpretation, protection, and education. Typically this process operates as a specialized aspect of a society's planning system, and its practitioners are termed built or historic environment conservation professionals. =Functional definition= Architectural conservation is the process by which individuals or groups attempt to protect valued buildings from unwanted change.Griffith, Richard(2010) 'Listed building control? A critique of historic building administration', CulturalTrends, 19: 3, p.192 History of the architectural conservation movement Old Synagogue, Erfurt in Germany As a movement, architectural conservation in general, and the preservation of ancient structures specifically, gained momentum during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a response to Modernism and its corresponding architectural perspective, which eschewed sentimental attachment to old buildings and structures in favor of technological and architectural progress and change. Prior to this time most of the ancient buildings that were still standing had only survived because they either had significant cultural or religious import, or they had yet to be discovered. The growth of the architectural conservation movement took place at a time of significant archaeological discovery and scientific advancement. Those educated in the field began to see various examples of architecture as either being \\"correct\\" or \\"incorrect\\". Because of this, two schools of thought began to emerge within the field of building conservation. Preservation/Conservation were used interchangeably to refer to the architectural school of thought that either encouraged measures that would protect and maintain buildings in their current state, or would prevent further damage and deterioration to them. This school of thought saw the original design of old buildings as correct in and of themselves. Two of the main proponents of preservation and conservation in the 19th century were art critic John Ruskin and artist William Morris. Restoration was the conservationist school of thought that believed historic buildings could be improved, and sometimes even completed, using current day materials, design, and techniques. In this way it is very similar to the Modernist architectural theory, except it does not advocate the destruction of ancient structures. One of the most ardent supporters of this school of thought in the 19th century was the French architect Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc. Victorian restoration of medieval churches was widespread in England and elsewhere, with results that were deplored at the time by William Morris and are now widely regretted. Current treatments The Department of the Interior of the United States defined the following treatment approaches to architectural conservation: *Preservation, \\"places a high premium on the retention of all historic fabric through conservation, maintenance and repair. It reflects a building's continuum over time, through successive occupancies, and the respectful changes and alterations that are made.\\" *Rehabilitation \\"emphasizes the retention and repair of historic materials, but more latitude is provided for replacement because it is assumed the property is more deteriorated prior to work. (Both Preservation and Rehabilitation standards focus attention on the preservation of those materials, features, finishes, spaces, and spatial relationships that, together, give a property its historic character.\\" See also adaptive reuse. *Restoration \\"focuses on the retention of materials from the most significant time in a property's history, while permitting the removal of materials from other periods.\\" *Reconstruction, \\"establishes limited opportunities to re-create a non-surviving site, landscape, building, structure, or object in all new materials.\\" Other nations recognize some or all of these as potential treatments for historic structures. Canada recognizes preservation, rehabilitation, and restoration. The Burra Charter, for Australia, identifies preservation, restoration, and reconstruction. Common architectural conservation/preservation problems Conservation patches on mosaics wall of Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau (Barcelona) Punched lead cast in a Venice bridge wall fixing the hard-metal connecting bar The earliest building materials used by ancient peoples, such as wood and mud, were organic.Rebano-Edwards, Susan. \\"Conservation of Stone Buildings - Simple Preservation Techniques for Ancient Buildings.\\" Suite101.com. 20 January 2010. Organic materials were used because they were plentiful and renewable. Unfortunately, the organic materials used were also very susceptible to the two most significant impediments to preservation and conservation: the elements and life (both human and animal). Over time inorganic materials like brick, stone, metal, concrete, and terra cotta began to be used by ancient people instead of organic ones, due to their durability. In fact, we know that these materials are durable because many ancient structures that are composed of them, even some built as far back as the Bronze Age, like Egypt's Great Pyramids, still stand today. Ancient buildings such as the Egyptian pyramids, the Roman Colosseum, and the Parthenon face common preservation issues. The most prominent factors affecting these structures are the environment, pollution, and tourism. As the Earth's climate patterns change, so too do the environmental conditions governing these buildings. For example, the Colosseum has already faced lightning, fire, and earthquakes. The changing climate increases the accumulation of salt crystals on the outside of monuments like the Colosseum and the Parthenon. This phenomenon increases the deterioration of these buildings. The salt crystals further contribute to the black effect that man-made pollution has on these buildings. The Parthenon is especially exposed and many of the remaining marbles are eroding to the point that they may no longer be identifiable. The pollution from corrosive agents in the air has also attributed to this deterioration. The third factor affecting ancient building conservation is tourism. While tourism provides both economical and cultural benefits, it can also be destructive. The Egyptian tomb of Seti the 1st is currently off limits to the public due to the deterioration that has been caused by tourists. The pyramids in Giza have also encountered problems due to large numbers of tourists; more tourists mean greater humidity and water presence, which can lead to erosion. All of the above factors complicate the conservation options available to treat these buildings. Conservation process A preserved historical alleyway in Beirut Central District =Assessment= The first step in any building conservation project is a sensitive assessment of its history and merits. As noted architect Donald Insall states, \\"Every building has its own biography. A knowledge of the whole life of a building brings an essential understanding of its features and its problems.Art conservation and restoration,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2010. Web. 26 Apr. 2010 He gives the Parthenon in Athens as an example; built between 447 and 432 BCE to serve as a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, its purpose over time changed to Christian church, mosque, and powder magazine before it became one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world. Once the assessment is complete, the next step is a thorough measured survey with a tape, rod and level. Modern measuring techniques, such as photogrammetry (the use of aerial photographs to make maps and surveys) and stereophotogrammetry, are also used today to increase accuracy. Once the measurements are complete, there is an analysis of the structural stability of the building and its living pattern of movement. No building is permanently still; soil and wind can affect building stability and need to be documented. Finally, the architect or surveyor tests the electrical connections, plumbing, and other utilities present in the building (this is more for historic and re-purposed buildings). For both ancient and historic buildings, lightning conductors and fire-fighting equipment are checked to make sure they can provide sufficient protection.\\"Art conservation and restoration,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

Web. 26 Apr. 2010 At the end of this assessment process, the conservator will analyze all the collected data and decide on a conservation plan based on available funding sources.. =Treatment= The phrase covers a wide span of activities, from the cleaning of the interior or exterior of a building ‚Äî as took place at St Paul's Cathedral in London ‚Äî to the rebuilding of damaged or derelict buildings, such as the restoration of the Windsor Great Hall in Windsor Castle after a destructive fire in 1992. The 1985‚Äì1989 removal of 38 layers of paint and the cleaning and repair of the exterior sandstone walls of the White House in the United States are an example of building restoration. Buildings are structures which have, from time to time, particular purposes. They require ongoing maintenance to prevent them falling into disrepair as a result of the ravages of time and use. Building restoration can be thought of as that set of activities which are greater than year-to-year maintenance, but which by retaining the building are less than a demolition and the construction of a new building. Not all building conservation seeks to follow the original design of the building. It is reasonably commonplace for the shell of a building ‚Äî its external walls ‚Äî to be retained whilst an entirely new building is constructed within. This approach is also referred to as adaptive reuse. Although techniques of architectural conservation are improving, the action of cleaning or repairing buildings can, with hindsight, be seen to cause problems that at the time were unforeseen. A good example is the unrestrained use of sandblasting to clean smog deposits from soft-stoned buildings ‚Äî a technique employed in the UK in the 1960s and 1970s ‚Äî which has damaged the external faces of stonework to the extent that in some cases, later, the stonework has needed to be replaced. Contemporary building codes recognize such problems, and (it is to be hoped) mitigate poor outcomes. Case example: Ancient stone structures Most ancient buildings are constructed of stone and have survived from antiquity as a result of the stability of this building material. However, stone can deteriorate rapidly without protection, particularly in our modern era of pollution and climate change. Public awareness and outreach to promote architectural conservation There are many organizations that work to raise public awareness of the necessity to preserve ancient and historic buildings and areas, across communities, users and government. In addition to promoting the cultural value of these buildings, and encouraging appropriate policies and strategies for conservation, the organizations can help in raising the required funding to implement conservation initiatives and plans, and often serve as a link between the community and local/federal governments to advance conservation projects.

It was made famous by the Battle of Cable Street in 1936. Location Cable Street starts near the edge of London's financial district the City of London in south-western Whitechapel and continues on through to central Shadwell and then to south-eastern Stepney where the junction between Cable Street and Butcher Row in Limehouse. The street is parallel to, and south of, the Docklands Light Railway and Commercial Road, and north of The Highway. The area is close to Wapping and Shadwell Basin to the south, Tower Hill to the west, and Aldgate to the north. Since many Londoners define their locality by the nearest London Underground stations, the Cable Street area is often referred to as Shadwell. The street is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, in postal district E1. It lies within the parliamentary constituencies of Bethnal Green and Bow and Poplar and Limehouse, currently represented by Rushanara Ali and Jim Fitzpatrick, both of the Labour party.  History  Cable Street started as a straight path along which hemp ropes were twisted into ships' cables (i.e. ropes). These supplied the many ships that would anchor in the nearby Pool of London, between London Bridge and Wapping and Rotherhithe. Many other ropewalks can be seen on later maps, showing how demand for ropes grew as shipping increased. Until Victorian times, the current Cable Street had different names for each of its sections. From west to east these ran: Cable Street, Knock Fergus, New Road, Back Lane, Blue Gate Fields, Sun Tavern Fields, and Brook Street. Knock Fergus may have been a reference to the large numbers of Irish residents there then, but the name is old ‚Äì it is found in the St Dunstan Stepney registers in the early 1600s. Also, in the 19th century, the area at the western end of Cable Street was identified as \\"near Wellclose Square\\", as this was a well-known landmark, where nautical items were sold. The whole of the central area of the current street was named after St George in the East church and St George in the East parish. From Victorian times through to the 1950s, Cable Street had a reputation for cheap lodgings, brothels, drinking inns and opium dens. The last occasion in England when a stake was hammered through a sinner‚Äôs heart at an official burial, took place at the junction of Cable Street and Cannon Street Road: John Williams was found hanged in his cell, after being arrested as a suspect in the Ratcliff Highway murders. Local people went along with the claim that he had committed suicide, from guilt of the crimes. At the time, 1812, suicide was considered to be sinful, and justified him being buried upside down with a stake through his heart. His skull was found when new gas mains were being laid in August 1886, and was on display for many years in The Crown and Dolphin pub opposite. Red plaque in Dock Street commemorating the Battle of Cable Street. On 4 October 1936 a violent confrontation between the Metropolitan Police and local communities on the street was later named the 'Battle of Cable Street'. Communist, anarchist, labour and Jewish groups joined with locals to resist a planned march through the East End by Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists. The East End has traditionally been an area of London with a large Jewish population. It is estimated that around 100,000 Jews from Eastern Europe had fled to the East End in the period 1881‚Äì1914.Life in the East End on the Jewish Museum website A bus was overturned and used as a barricade, Mosley's car was attacked with bricks, and there was some of the most violent hand-to-hand fighting ever seen in London. The march was eventually abandoned. A large mural (created between 1979 and 1983) on St George's Town Hall, next to Library Place, depicts scenes from the day. A red plaque at Cable Street's junction with Dock Street commemorates the incident.

It is mostly west-bound, but it is east-bound east of Brodlove Lane (itself one-way north-bound). It lies outside of the London congestion charge zone (CCZ). ;Bicycle London Cycle Superhighway 3 runs the length of Cable Street in the form of a two-way segregated cycle track, continuing west into Royal Mint Street (its western terminus). This is well used by cyclists, especially those commuting to the City and Docklands. ;Bus London Buses routes 100 and D3 both pass west-bound through the central part of Cable Street: * Route 100 connects to Wapping, Liverpool Street, St Paul's Cathedral and Elephant and Castle. * Route D3 connects to the Isle of Dogs, Limehouse, Wapping and Bethnal Green. * Route 339 connects to Mile End, Bow and Old Ford from next to Shadwell DLR station. ;Rail The district falls within Transport for London's Travelcard zone 2. The nearest London Underground station is Tower Hill. Opened in 2010, the nearest London Overground stations are Shadwell and Wapping on the East London Line.

The Culture of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijani: Az…ôrbaycan m…ôd…ôniyy…ôti) developed under the influence of Iranian, Turkic and Caucasian heritage as well as Russian influences due to its former status as a Soviet republic. Today, Western influences, including globalized consumer culture, are prevalent. History Gobustan dating back to 10,000 BC, indicating a thriving culture. Azerbaijan is the modern name of a historical and geographic region on the border of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, and formerly known as Aran or Ardan by various Persian Empires, or by Albania by Greeks. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia's Daghestan region to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia and Turkey to the southwest, and Iran to the south. Azerbaijan is a home to diverse ethnicities, majority of which are Azeris, an ethnic group which numbers to 10 million in the independent Republic of Azerbaijan. The heritage, culture, and civilization of this region today known as the country of Azerbaijan has both ancient and modern roots. The people of the modern country of Azerbaijan are believed to be inheritors of various ancient civilizations and peoples, including the indigenous Caucasian Albanians tribes such as Scythians and Alans, and the later arrival of Oghuz Turks, among others (note that several modern peoples of the Caucasus can trace their ancestries to more than one of these same ancient peoples). =Caucasian Albania= Sinay Palimstet in Caucasian Albanian language Caucasian Albanians are believed to be the earliest inhabitants of the land above the Aras river today known as Azerbaijan. Early invaders included the Iranian Scythians in the 9th century BCE.Azerbaijan - US Library of Congress Country Studies (retrieved 7 June 2006). The South Caucasus was eventually fully assimilated and conquered by the Persian Achaemenids around 550 BCE. Zoroastrianism was already prevalent among the Medes in the lands below and above the Aras river, and long before the Acheamenids assimilated these lands into the eventual empire. The Achaemenids in turn were defeated by Alexander the Great in 330 BCE. Following the decline of the Seleucids in Persia in 247 BCE and the succession by the Parthians, the Caucasian Albanians established a kingdom in the 1st century BCE and largely remained independent under Parthian rule, until the Sassanids made the kingdom a province in 252 CE.James Stuart Olson. An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: The list of provinces given in the inscription of Ka'be-ye Zardusht defines the extent of the empire under Shapur, in clockwise geographic enumeration: (1) Persis (Fars), (2) Parthia, (3) Susiana (Khuzestan), (4) Maishan (Mesene), (5) Asuristan (southern Mesopotamia), (6) Adiabene, (7) Arabistan (northern Mesopotamia), (8) Atropatene (Azerbaijan), (9) Armenia, (10) Iberia (Georgia), (11) Machelonia, (12) Albania (eastern Caucasus), (13) Balasagan up to the Caucasus Mountains and the Gate of Albania (also known as Gate of the Alans), (14) Patishkhwagar (all of the Elburz Mountains), (15) Media, (16) Hyrcania (Gorgan), (17) Margiana (Merv), (18) Aria, (19) Abarshahr, (20) Carmania (Kerman), (21) Sakastan (Sistan), (22) Turan, (23) Mokran (Makran), (24) Paratan (Paradene), (25) India (probably restricted to the Indus River delta area), (26) Kushanshahr, until as far as Peshawar and until Kashgar and (the borders of) Sogdiana and Tashkent, and (27), on the farther side of the sea, Mazun (Oman) Caucasian Albania's ruler, King Urnayr, officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the 4th century CE, and Albania would remain a Christian state until the 8th century.\\"Albania\\" - Encyclopedia Iranica, p. 807 (retrieved 15 June 2006).\\"Voices of the Ancients: Heyerdahl Intrigued by Rare Caucasus Albanian Text\\" by Dr. Zaza Alexidze - Azerbaijan International, Summer 2002 (retrieved 7 June 2006). Sassanid control ended with their defeat by Muslim Arabs in 642 CE,\\"Islamic Conquest.\\" through the Muslim conquest of Persia. =Islamic period= Arabic inscriptions in gates of Ganja Well before Islam arrived in the region, the region above the Aras river today known as Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia, was for centuries under Sassanid Iranian rule, and before that under Parthian Iranian rule. Muslim Arabs defeated the Sassanids and Byzantines as they marched into the Caucasus region. The Arabs made Caucasian Albania a vassal state after the Christian resistance, led by Prince Javanshir, surrendered in 667. Between the 9th and 10th centuries, Arab authors continued to refer to the region between the Kura and Aras rivers as Arran. During this time, Arabs from Basra and Kufa came to Aran and seized lands that the indigenous peoples had abandoned; the Arabs became a land-owning elite.A History of Islamic Societies by Ira Lapidus, p. 48. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (1988), (retrieved 7 June 2006). Despite pockets of continued resistance, the majority of the inhabitants of Azerbaijan converted to Islam. Later on in the 10th and 11th centuries, Kurdish dynasties of Shaddadid and Rawadid ruled parts of Aran. =Seljuqs and successor states= The Seljuq period of Azerbaijan's history was possibly even more pivotal than the Arab conquest as it helped shape the ethno- linguistic nationality of the modern Azerbaijani Turks. After decline of Abbasid Khalifate, the territory of Azerbaijan was under the sway of numerous Iranian dynasties such as the Salarids, Sajids, and Shaddadids. However at the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of Oghuz Turkic tribes emanating from Central Asia. The first of these Turkic dynasties was the Ghaznavids from present-day northern Afghanistan, who took over part of Azerbaijan by 1030. They were followed by the Seljuqs, a western branch of the Oghuz who conquered all of Iran and the Caucasus and pressed on to Iraq where they overthrew the Buyids in Baghdad in 1055. =Shirvanshahs= Shƒ´rwƒÅn ShƒÅhBarthold, W., C.E. Bosworth \\"Shirwan Shah, Sharwan Shah. \\"Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2nd edition or SharwƒÅn ShƒÅh, was the title in medieval Islamic times of Azerbaijani people. The Shirvanshah established a dynasty that ruled over the Aran region (present-day Azerbaijan Republic) as well as parts of Dagestan,Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition, Columbia University, 1995, p. 2, : \\"In the fifteenth century this dynasty of Shirvanshahs flourished north of the Araxes.\\" and were rulers of Shirvan, a historical region in present-day Azerbaijan Republic. The Shirvanshahs established the longest Islamic dynasty in the Islamic world. =Safavids and the rise of Shi'a Islam= Shah Abbas I of Safavid at a banquet. The Safavid (Safaviyeh) were a Sufi religious order formed in the 1330s by Sheikh Safi-ad-din Ardabili (1252‚Äì1334), after whom it was eponymously named. This Sufi order openly converted to the heterodox branch of twelver Shi'a Islam by the end of the 15th century. Some Safavid followers, most notably the Qizilbash Turks, believed in the mystical and esoteric nature of their rulers and their relationship to the house of Ali, and thus, were zealously predisposed to fight for them. The Safavid rulers claimed to be descended from Ali himself and his wife Fatimah, daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, through the seventh Imam Musa al-Kazim. Qizilbash numbers increased by the 16th century and their generals were able to wage a successful war against the Ak Koyunlu state and capture Tabriz. The Safavids, led by Ismail I, expanded their base, sacking Baku in 1501 and persecuting the Shirvanshahs. = From Iranian rule to Russian rule = The region of Aran had been under subsequent Persian-based empires since millennia, with the last one being the Qajar dynasty. Following their defeat by Imperial Russia, Qajar Persia was forced to sign the Treaty of Gulistan in 1813, which acknowledged the loss of the territory of Aran (today known as the country of Azerbaijan), Dagestan, and Georgia to Russia. Local khanates were either abolished (like in Baku or Ganja) or accepted Russian patronage. Another Russo-Persian war in 1826-28, while starting off with a loss for the Russians, eventually resulted in the final crushing defeat for the Iranian army. The Russians dictated another final settlement as per the Treaty of Turkmenchay, which resulted in the Qajars of Persia officially ceding all their Caucasian territories in 1828. The treaty established the current borders of Tsarist Russia and Iran. and divided the Azerbaijani people between two nations; Iran and Azerbaijan. Until 1918, the region was still known as Aran, until the Mussavatis, renamed the region as Azerbaijan, resembling the historical name of the Iranian province of Azarbaijan. In the Russian-controlled territories, two provinces were established that later constituted the bulk of the modern Republic - Elisavetpol (Ganja) province in the west, and Shamakha province in the east. =Azerbaijan Democratic Republic= At the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, an independent republic was proclaimed in Tbilisi on May 28, 1918 following an abortive attempt to establish a federal Transcaucasian Republic with Armenia and Georgia. This was the first Democratic Republic established in Islamic World. Among the important accomplishments of the Parliament was the extension of suffrage to women, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim state in the world to give women equal political rights with men. In this accomplishment, Azerbaijan preceded even such developed countries as the United Kingdom and the United States. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, which was the first modern- type university founded in Azerbaijan. Architecture Maiden Tower in old town Baku. Architecture in the country of Azerbaijan typically combines elements of East and West. Many ancient architectural treasures such as the Maiden Tower and Palace of the Shirvanshahs in the walled city of Baku are old Iranian architecture, and survive in modern country of Azerbaijan. Among other medieval architectural treasures reflecting the Iranian roots of architecture in the region are the Shirvan shahs' palace in Baku, the palace of the Shaki Khans in the town of Shaki in north-central Azerbaijan, the Surakhany Temple on the Apsheron Peninsula, a number of bridges spanning the Aras River, and several mausoleums. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, little monumental architecture was created, but distinctive residences were built in Baku and elsewhere. Among the most recent architectural monuments, the Baku subways are noted for their lavish decor. =Development in the 19th century= The most typical distinguishing features of Azerbaijan's architecture in the 19th century were the expansion of towns, application of Russian town-planning principles and the development of the general layouts of Ganja, Shemakha and Baku. The construction of advanced buildings, after Northern Azerbaijan was ceded to Russia, had a significant importance. New buildings such as theaters, schools, hospitals, and houses were constructed in the middle of the 19th century. The establishment and continuous development of capitalist relations produced a strong impact on the architectural development of Azerbaijan. The peculiarities of Azerbaijani architecture can easily be found in Baku buildings that were built during the period of oil industry development in the 19th-20th centuries. Baku was becoming one of the largest cities in Russia. =Development in the 20th century= The first stage of the architectural development in Azerbaijan during the Soviet period was related the construction of the working settlements of Binagadi, Rasulzade, Bakikhanov, Montino, Mammadyarov around Baku. Working settlements in Absheron were the first examples of young Soviet architecture. A number of schools were built in Baku and other cities of Azerbaijan during 1933‚Äì1936. Four-storied buildings, constructed upon projects by S.Dadashov and M.Useynov in Baku and other towns of the country, distinguish for expressiveness of architectural solutions. Classic forms along with national architecture traditions are typical for these projects. The projecting and construction of the Neft Dashlari (Oil Stones) - steel pillar settlements in the open sea - heralded the beginning of a new era in post-war architecture. The Neft Dashlari was built in connection with the discovery of rich oil fields in the Caspian Sea in 1949. This extraordinary settlement includes dwelling houses, cultural objects, overpasses, etc. The new period in town-building and architectural development of Azerbaijan began in Azerbaijan in the 1960s. Baku, the capital of the Republic of Azerbaijan, grew into a large capital city during these years. This was also the time of erection of wonderful architectural ensembles and advanced buildings, which defined the city image. Cinema The first film studio in Baku established in the 1920s. The film industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in cinematography: it is not surprising that this new medium soon showed up in cosmopolitan nouveau-riche Baku at the turn of the 19th century.Celebrating 100 Years in Film, not 80 by Aydin Kazimzade. in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 5:1 (Autumn 1997), pp. 30-35. Cuisine The Azerbaijani cuisine, throughout the centuries, has been influenced by the foods of different cultures due to political and economic processes in Azerbaijan. Still, today's Azerbaijani cuisine has distinctive and unique features. Many foods that are indigenous to the country can now be seen in the cuisines of other cultures. For the Azerbaijanis, food is an important part of the country's culture and is deeply rooted in the history, traditions and values of the nation. =Pomegranate Festival= Pomegranate fruit, opened Every year a cultural festival is held in Goychay, Azerbaijan known as Pomegranate Festival. The festival features Azerbaijani fruit-cuisine mainly the pomegranates from Goychay. At the festival, a parade is held with traditional Azerbaijani dances and Azerbaijani music.Iguide.travel Goychay Activities: Pomegranate Festival The Pomegranate Festival usually takes place in October. Dance There are a number of Azerbaijani dances, these folk dances of the Azerbaijani people are old and extremely melodious. It is performed at formal celebrations and the dancers wear festival clothes. It has a very fast rhythm, so the dancer must have inherent skill. Azerbaijan's national dance shows the characteristics of the Azerbaijani nation. These dances differ from other dances with its quick temp and optimism. And this talks about nation's braveness. The national clothes of Azerbaijan are well preserved within the national dances. =Examples= Abayi (Azerbaijani: Abayƒ±) is an Azerbaijani dance with its origins from Shaki and Zaqatala region of Az * [erbaijan. The subject matter of the dance is middle age. In this area middle-aged people are called \\"Abayi\\" and this kind of dance is generally performed by middle-aged men or women. Creators of the melody of this dance are the Shaki composers. It is a little exaggerating and funny and has a slow dancing tempo. This kind of dance used to be performed in group formerly, but later on changed to an individual dance.Azerbaijani Dance * Agir Karadagi (Azerbaijani: Aƒüƒ±r Qaradaƒüƒ± - meaning heavy Karadakhi]) is Azerbaijani melody of a dance that is created in Karadakh. It is very popular in Shaki and Zaqatala in Azerbaijan and performed slowly. * Alcha Gulu (Azerbaijani: Al√ßa gulu - meaning Plum Flower) is an Azerbaijani-Indian dance created between 1910 and 1920 in Shaki region by Ali Karimov who lived in Kalva village. It is performed by women and has a fast dancing tempo. *Anzali (Azerbaijani: ∆ènz…ôli) is the melody of a dance which is almost created in the years 1880‚Äì1890 in Baku. It is performed slowly and for this reason it is suitable for old people. \\"Anzali\\" dance is a traditional dance. It is performed at the first of the marriage. In origin the old people perform this dance.

Folk art Carpet based on the Layla and Majnun novel by Nizami Ganjavi in the 12th century. Over the ancient history of Azerbaijan the Azeris have created a rich and distinctive culture, a major part of which is decorative and applied art. This form of art rooted in hoary antiquity is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweler, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of decorative art, evidence and endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very much in favor here. Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times. =Azerbaijani rugs= A rug market in the town of Ganja, a 19th-century photo. Azerbaijani rugs are a product of Azerbaijan, an ancient center of carpet weaving. Azerbaijan has been since the ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working, pottery and ceramics, and last but not least carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC. Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups. The true scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of Latif Kerimov, a prominent scientist and artist. It was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan, i.e. Guba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh and Tabriz. Baku rug Baku carpets are marked for their increased softness of the material and intense colors, as well as excellent artistic taste and exquisite decoration. This school has about 10 compositions. The historical sources and inscriptions on the carpets testify to the fact that carpet making was widely spread in these villages and carpet-ware was exported outside the country. The carpet composition often includes medallions. They are filled by various motifs, most often by stylized images of plants, which lost their resemblance to the original object after they had been geometrized. Ganja rug The carpets of Ganja are notable for peculiarity of their compositions and ornamental patterns. The Ganja carpets include a relatively small number of carpet compositions, all in all between 8 and 20 patterns. The Kazakh carpets cover about 16 compositions with various patterns. Kazakh, which is located on the NW of Azerbaijan, is the most famous carpet production region and also accounts for the Kazakh and Borchaly carpet groups. The Kazakh carpets have a geometrical ornamental pattern, the composition is not very complex with a focus on a schematic presentation of the geometrical patterns, plants and animals. The ornamental decor of the Ganja carpets is rich and diverse, with a focus on geometrical motifs as well as schematic presentation of plants and animals. Karabakh rug A Karabakh carpet of Gasimushagy subgroup, ≈û…ôlv…ô village of Lachin, 1819 Novruz The Karabakh carpet is one of five major regional groups of carpets made in Azerbaijan named after the Karabakh region, which comprises present Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent lowland territories ('lowland Karabakh'). The Karabakh carpets amount to 33 compositions. Due to the specifics of the local sheep wool the Karabakh carpets are characterized by thick pile, high and fluffy. These carpets are marked for their vivid and joyous colors. They are divided into four groups: without medallions, with medallions, namazlyk and subject carpet. In the mountainous part of Karabakh the carpets were made in Malybeili, Muradkhanly, Dashbulakh, Jebrail, Goradis and many other villages. Shirvan rug Shirvan is one of the most ancient historical regions of Azerbaijan. Carpet making of different types is a widespread craft with both settled and nomadic natives. The Shirvan school accounts for carpets manufactured in the following towns and villages of the Shirvan region: Shemaha, Maraza, Akhsu, Kurdamir. The school totals 25 compositions. The Salyan carpets, with similar artistic and technical features, also belong to this school. The Shirvan carpets are characterized by an intricate design, which depicts numerous artifacts of everyday life, birds and people. Novruz Azerbaijan is a country where national traditions are well preserved. One of the oldest traditions of the people in this country is the celebration of Novruz and is a cherished holiday of a New Year and spring. It is celebrated on the day of vernal equinox - March 21‚Äì22. Novruz is the symbol of nature renewal and fertility. Novrus, also known as Nooroz or Nawruz in other countries, is an ancient celebration shared among peoples living under pre-Islamic Persian Empires. Cultural festivities during Novruz have striking resemblance to those in other countries of the region, namely Iran. Preparations for Novruz start long before the holiday. Rooted in Zoarastrian beliefs, in preparation for the arrival of the New Year, people do house cleaning, plant trees, make new dresses, paint eggs, make national pastries such as shekerbura, pakhlava and a great variety of local cuisine. As is traditional in other countries that celebrate Novruz, wheat is fried with kishmish (raisins) and nuts (govurga). It is essential for every house to have semeni - sprouts of wheat. As a tribute to fire-worshiping (an ancient Zoarastrian belief) every Tuesday during four weeks before the holiday kids jump over small bonfires and candles are lit, a tradition shared with Iran, where it is called Chahar-shanbeh sori. On the holiday eve the graves of relatives are visited and tended. Novruz is a family holiday. In the evening before the holiday the whole family gathers around the holiday table laid with various dishes to make the New Year rich. The holiday goes on for several days and ends with festive public dancing and other entertainment of folk bands, contests of national sports. In rural areas crop holidays are marked. Literature Azerbaijani Literature refers to the literature written in Azerbaijani, which currently is the official state language of the Republic of Azerbaijan and is spoken by about a quarter of the population of Iran. Its closest relatives are Turkish and Turkmen. Azeri is a dialect of Oghuz branch of Turkic languages, and as such, is mutually intelligible with other Oghuz dialects spoken in Turkey, Iran, Turkmenistan, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Russia, the Balkans and the Middle East. It is worth noting that the Azeri Turkic language came into existence with the invasion and settlement of waves of Turkic tribes from Central Asia over several centuries. The indigenous language of the region above and below the Aras river was a mix of Iranian Tati, Taleshi, and Armenian. With the increasing dominance of Turkic rulers, the language of the region gradually was infused with Turkic, resulting in what is known in modern days as the Azeri language. Taleshi is still a spoken language in parts of the Republic of Azerbaijan. As a result of the language policy of the Soviet Union, Russian is also commonly spoken as a second language among the urbane. =Classical Era= Apart from the Epic of Dede Korkut, which may date to the 9th century CE. and was first transcribed by the 14th century, the earliest known figure in Azeri literature was Pur Hasan Asfaraini, who composed a divan consisting of Persian and Turkic ghazals.A. Caferoglu, \\"Adhari(azeri)\\", in Encyclopedia of Islam, (new edition), Vol. 1, (Leiden, 1986) In Persian ghazals he used his own name, while his Turkic ghazals were composed under a pen-name of Hasan Oghlu. Nizami Ganjavi who was born in Ganja is considered the greatest romantic epic poet in Persian literature, who brought a colloquial and realistic style to the Persian epic.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Nezami\\"Dr. Julie Scott Meisami, \\"The Haft Paykar: A Medieval Persian Romance (Oxford World's Classics)\\", Oxford University Press (T), 1995, , extract His heritage is widely appreciated and shared by Azerbaijan, Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan. In the 14th century, Azerbaijan was under the control of Qara Qoyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu Turkic tribal confederacies. Among the poets of this period were Kadi Burhan al-Din, Haqiqi (pen-name of Jahan-shah Qara Qoyunlu), and Habibi. The end of the 14th century was also the period of starting literary activity of Imadaddin Nesimi, one of the greatest Turkic Hurufi mystical poets of the late 14th and early 15th centuries and one of the most prominent early Divan masters in Turkic literary history, who also composed poetry in Persian and Arabic. =Soviet Azerbaijani Literature= Detail of the fa√ßade of Ismailiya building in Baku. Under the Soviet rule, particularly during Joseph Stalin's reign, Azeri writers who did not conform to the party line were persecuted. Bolsheviks sought to destroy the nationalist intellectual elite established during the short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, and in the 1930s, many writers and intellectuals were essentially turned into mouthpieces of Soviet propaganda. =Influences on Azeri Literature= Persian and Arabic literature have greatly influenced Azeri literature, especially in its classical phase. Amongst poets who have written in Persian and have influenced Azeri literature, one can mention Ferdowsi, Sanai, Hafiz, Saadi, Attar, and Rumi. Arabic literature, especially the Quran and Prophetic sayings, has also played a major role in influencing Azeri literature. Amongst poets who have written in Arabic and have influenced Azeri literature, one can mention Mans≈´r al- HallƒÅj who has had a wide-ranging influence in the Sufic literature of the Islamic world. =Journalism= In 1875 Akinchi (∆èkin√ßi / ÿß⁄©ŸäŸÜ⁄Ü€å ) (\\"The Ploughman\\") became the first Azeri newspaper to be published in the Russian Empire. It was started by Hasan bey Zardabi, a journalist and education advocate. Starting in the 1830s several newspapers were published in Iran during the reign of the Azeri speaking Qajar dynasty but it is unknown whether any of these newspapers were written in Azeri. In the Republic of Azerbaijan recent years, large numbers of Azerbaijani journalists, bloggers, lawyers, and human rights activists have been rounded up and jailed for their criticism of President Aliyev and government authorities.\\"Jailed without trial in Azerbaijan,\\" The Washington Post. 1 March 2015. Retrieved 26 September 2015. Music Music of Azerbaijan includes various styles that reflect influences from the music of the Iran, Caucasus and Central Asia. Azerbaijani music is also similar to Iranian music and Turkish.Almaty or Bust , Sultanova and Broughton, pg. 25 =Mugam= The classical music of Azerbaijan is called mugam (more accurately spelled muƒüam), and is usually a suite with poetry and instrumental interludes. The sung poetry sometimes includes tahrir segments, which use a form of throat singing similar to yodelling. The poetry is typically about divine love and is most often linked to Sufi Islam. In contrast to the mugam traditions of Central Asian countries, Azeri mugam is more free-form and less rigid; it is often compared to the improvised field of jazz. UNESCO proclaimed the Azerbaijani mugam tradition a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 7 November 2003. Meykhana and Mugham are one of the many musical traditions of Azerbaijan. During Mugam, the singers have to transform their emotions into singing and music. Mugham singer Alim Qasimov is revered as one of the five best singers of all time.\\"Alim Qasimov: the living legend you‚Äôve never heard of\\" on timesonline.co.uk Meykhana is a kind of traditional Azeri distinctive folk unaccompanied song, usually performed by several people improvising on a particular subject. Among national musical instruments there are fourteen string instruments, eight percussion instruments and six wind instruments. Mugam Festival Annually a cultural and musical festival that is held in Shaki, known as Mugam Festival. The Mugham Festival was founded and is traditionally celebrated in the Azerbaijani city of Shusha. The last Mugham Festival in Shusha took place in 1988. Because of the conflict in the Karabakh region, Shusha has been occupied by Armenian forces since 1992 and all Azeris have fled the city. Today the festival lives on and has been held in Shaki since November 1994. Every year thousands of people participate in this festival. =Meykhana= Soviet postage stamp depicting musical instruments of Azerbaijan Meykhana is a distinctive Azerbaijani literary and folk rap tradition, consisting of an unaccompanied song performed by one or more people improvising on a particular subject. The name of this genre comes from the traditional Turkish meyhane (tavern, pub), which itself originated from the Persian words mey (wine) and hane (house). Since medieval times, meyhanes were places where poets would gather exchanging verses in an extemporaneous fashion, sometimes joking and disparaging one another. At the end of the contest, the audience determined which poet had improvised the most elegant and clever verses and declared him the winner. These contests may be compared with modern poetry improvisation contests or even with rap battles. =Musical instruments= Instruments used in traditional Azeri music include the stringed instruments tar (skin faced lute), the kamancha (skin faced spike fiddle), the oud, originally barbat, and the saz (long necked lute); the double-reed wind instrument balaban, the frame drum ghaval, the cylindrical double faced drum naghara (davul), and the goshe nagara (naqareh) (pair of small kettle drums). Other instruments include the garmon (small accordion), tutek (whistle flute), daf (frame drum) and nagara (drum) (barrel drum). =Ashiqs= Ashiqs are traveling bards who sing and play the saz, a form of lute. Their songs are semi-improvised around a common base. The Ashik tradition in Turkic cultures of Anatolia, Azerbaijan and Central Asia has its origin in the Shamanistic beliefs of ancient Turkic peoples.IUE.it - European University Institute, Florence, Italy (retrieved 10 August 2006). National holidays A man wearing an ancient Azerbaijani military garment during a Nowruz celebration in Baku. The most celebrated traditional Azerbaijani holiday is Novruz Bayram, which is the traditional celebration of the ancient New Year. Novruz is a family holiday. In the evening before the holiday the whole family gathers around the holiday table laid with various dishes to make the New Year rich. The holiday goes on for several days and ends with festive public dancing and other entertainment of folk bands, and contests of national sports. During the Soviet Union, celebration of Novruz was generally unofficial, and at times even prohibited. Since the independence of Azerbaijan, Novruz became an official public holiday. Usually preparation for Novruz begins a month prior to the festival. Each Tuesday of the forthcoming 4 weeks is devoted to one of the four elements - water, fire, earth and wind. Other public and traditional holidays include Ramadan, Women's Day, Ramazan Bayrami, Gurban Bayrami, Republic Day, Constitution Day, Victory Day, Armed Forces Day, Salvation Day, Flag Day, and more. Commemoration and remembrance days include Black January, Khojaly Massacre and the March Days. State symbols of Azerbaijan include the Eight- pointed star, combined with fire element in the Azerbaijan coat of arms. The Azerbaijani flag dates from the late Azerbaijan Democratic Republic period and became widely used since modern times. Azerbaijan National Anthem contains words by Ahmad Javad, and the music was composed by Uzeyir Hajibeyov. Religion Around 93 percent of Azerbaijan's population is nominally Muslim, while about 5 percent of the population adheres to Russian Orthodox Church. Among the Muslim majority, religious observance is relatively low and Muslim identity tends to be based more on culture and ethnicity rather than religion. The Muslim population is approximately 70 percent Shi'a and 30 percent Sunni; differences traditionally have not been defined sharply. There are fairly sizeable expatriate Christian and Muslim communities in the capital city of Baku; authorities generally permit these groups to worship freely. =Islam= After the collapse of the Soviet Union all religious organizations fell into depression and split into pieces while the Religious Organization of Transcaucasia, Muslims headed by akhund Allanshukur Pashazade elected the sheykhulislam in 1980 intensified its operation and tried to spread its influence to the entire Caucasus under the name of the Caucasus Muslims Department. The measures to implement these attempts were undertaken at the tenth session of the Caucasus Muslims held in Baku in 1998. The opening of CMD representations in Georgia and Dagestan was one of the significant steps in this field. =Christianity= Side view of the Church of Kish. Orthodoxy is currently represented in Azerbaijan by the Russian and Georgian Orthodox churches. The Russian Orthodox Churches are grouped in the Eparchy of Baku and the Caspian region. The Roman Catholic Church in Azerbaijan is part of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. It is one of the least Catholic countries in the world in terms of the number of adherents with only 400 faithful out of a total population of over seven million. About half of the congregation consists of foreigners that work as diplomats or work for oil companies. Construction of Catholic Church in Baku Coming to End by R. Manafli. Echo. 8 March 2007 =Judaism= There are three separate communities of Jews (Mountain Jews, Ashkenazi Jews, and Georgian Jews) in Azerbaijan, who total almost 16,000 combined. Of them, 11,000 are Mountain Jews, with concentrations of 6,000 in Baku and 4,000 in Guba, 4,300 are Ashkenazi Jews, most of whom live in Baku and Sumgayit, and 700 are Georgian Jews. =Zoroastrianism= Atashgah, a Zoroastrian Temple in Azerbaijan. The history of Zoroastrianism in Azerbaijan goes back to the first millennium BC. Together with the other territories of the Persian Empire, Azerbaijan remained a predominantly Zoroastrian state until the Arab invasion in the 7th century AD. The name Azerbaijan means the \\"Land of The Eternal Fire\\" in Middle Persian, a name that is said to have a direct link with Zoroastrianism. Today the religion, culture, and traditions of Zoroastrianism remains highly respected in Azerbaijan, and Novruz continues to be the main holiday in the country. Zoroastrianism has left a deep mark in the history of Azerbaijan. Traces of the religion are still visible in Atashgah, Ramana, Khinalyg, and Yanar Dag. Cultural reforms After gaining independence, Azerbaijan has taken important measures throughout the country to protect the cultural values, to enhance the cultural life and began to cooperate with international organizations in this area. A number of important legislative acts have been adopted by the Azerbaijani Parliament so far in the sphere of culture. These decisions are on: ‚ÄúRestoration of the Azerbaijani alphabet based on Latin script‚Äù (December 25, 1991); ‚ÄúMass media‚Äù (21 July 1992); ‚ÄúThe Copyright Agency of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù (10 September 1993); ‚ÄúAdvertising‚Äù (3 October 1997); ‚ÄúCulture‚Äù (6 February 1998); ‚ÄúProtection of historical and cultural monuments\\" (10 April 1998); ‚ÄúGrants‚Äù (17 April 1998); ‚ÄúFreedom of information‚Äù (19 June 1998); ‚ÄúCinematography‚Äù (3 July 1998); \\"Sculpture activities\\" (3 July 1998); ‚ÄúTourism‚Äù (4 July 1999); ‚ÄúUrban planning‚Äù (11 June 1999); ‚ÄúNational Archive Fund‚Äù (22 June 1999); ‚ÄúMass media‚Äù (8 February 2000); ‚ÄúMuseums‚Äù (24 March 2000); ‚ÄúPublishing‚Äù, etc. Legal basis of protection of cultural issues, particularly historical and cultural monuments is not only local legislative acts, but also international documents.

It consists of several metal rods, which are joined end-to-end by rings to form a flexible chain. Generally, the whip has a handle at one end and a metal dart, used for slashing or piercing an opponent, at the other. A cloth flag is often attached at or near the dart end of the whip and a second flag may cover the whip's handle. The flag or flags adds visual appeal and produces a rushing sound as the whip swings through the air. The rushing noise also helps the user with identifying the location of the other end, since the weapon moves too fast to be normally noticed by human eyes. Construction There is no standard on the length of the chain whip. The typical length is also different between north and south China. The chain is shorter in the south which make it more suitable for close quarter fighting. In the north the length could be from the ground to the chin or the ground to the tip of the nose. Weight is heavier for practice and lighter for performance. The cloth flag could be either rectangular or triangular. Triangular flags look better and move faster but rectangular flags sound better and allow better control. The number of segments vary. Traditional whips have either seven or nine segments. Modern whips typically have between seven and thirteen sections. Most whips today are made from stainless steel. With good whips, there is better color and shine to the metal, segments are stylized, holes are precisely centered, the chain rotates smoothly in the swivel built into the handle, there are no sharp corners or edges, and welds are strong. In addition, the handle should be shaped to allow good grip. Leather on the handles is best for endurance, as it absorbs sweat and prevents slippage. The typical construction method for chain whips is to use a steel bolt to thread through small pieces of leather and then use a lathe to round and shape the handle. The tip should be larger than the segments and weight proportional to the handle. Shape and weight distribution should allow the chain to be easily tossed and retrieved into one hand.

Beijing: Foreign Languages Press, 1996 () According to the book The Chain Whip, this may refer to the hard whip (more akin to a truncheon than a multi-section whip) due to the ambiguity in the Chinese. \\"Both the hard whip and the soft whip can both be referred to simply as whip (Èû≠) in Chinese.\\".Kie Brooks. The Chain Whip. Independent Press, 2015 () Different books make wildly differing claims about the history of the Chain Whip. Techniques Demonstration of the chain whip being performed. The chain whip is heavy but flexible, allowing it to be literally used as a whip to hit, hook and bind an opponent, restrict his/her movement, and to deflect blows from other weapons. The dart is used for slashing or piercing an opponent. In some cases, the dart might be coated with a poison. Because the whip is flexible, it can be used to strike around obstacles, including an opponent's block. The whip chain can be folded and hidden from view, making it an easy weapon to carry and conceal. Chain whip forms are often extremely elaborate. In some, the chain whip is thrown in the air and caught, flicked around the neck, or flung around underneath a recumbent performer. One classic technique, used to accelerate a spinning chain whip, involves rapidly wrapping and unwrapping the length of the chain around various parts of the body, including the legs, neck and elbows. Various twisting or flicking motions cause the chain whip to gain momentum as it unwraps. In practice, wrapping then unwrapping is used to change the direction of the spin in response to the opponent's movement. Chain whip techniques may be combined with jumping kicks and other acrobatics. Double chain whip forms have been developed, as have forms in which a chain whip is coupled with a broadsword. For performance the chain whip can be used to perform meteor moves such as one hand or two hand meteor rotors and weaves. At the end of the performance the chain whip segments can be pulled and collected into the hand holding the handle. As with all weapons that are either chained or tied together, the whip chain is hard to control without practice. In fact, it is harder to control than a traditional rawhide or bull whip because the linked sections provide looser joints while a bull whip is a continuous piece. The chain whip is sometimes considered one of the hardest weapons in martial arts to learn because lapse in the control of body movements in coordination with the position and momentum of the weapon will likely result in the weapon striking the wielder.

It was developed in November 1974, with the first aircraft delivered in September 1977. It is a pressurized, 8‚Äì9 passenger turbine development of the Cessna 404 Titan. Development Boarding on grass The original design from 1972 for this aircraft was known as the Model 435 and was to be powered by Continental GTSIO-520X engines with three bladed propellers. By 1975 the designed evolved into the turboprop powered Model 441. It was certified by the FAA on August 19, 1977. Cessna renamed the model 441 the Conquest II in 1983. 1984 models starting with constructor number 195 used lighter weight four-bladed McCauley propellers.Phillips, Edward H.: Wings of Cessna, Model 120 to the Citation III, Flying Books, 1986. A 441 with Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-112 turboprops was flown in 1986 but did not enter production. A smaller aircraft was marketed as the Cessna 425 Conquest I, itself a turbine development of the Cessna 421. In Summer 2007, Cessna limited the Conquest II to 22,500 hours of air time for US for air carriers, an advise only for private operators. Cessna built 362 units from 1977 through 1986.  Design  Original three-blade propellers It cruises at TAS while burning of fuel per hour at FL290, while maximum range is at TAS and /h at FL350. With six to nine seats, its BOW allows a payload at full fuel, but MTOW can be increased by with aftermarket modifications. Most have been upgraded from twin Garrett TPE331-8s engines to -10s for better climb performance, a ceiling raised to FL350 from FL330, and TBO raised from 3,000 to 5,000h for $225,000 per engine. Converting from the standard three blade propellers to smaller diameter Hartzell four blade propellers results in a climb rate improved by 200 fpm (1.01 m/s) and a increase in cruise speed as well as reducing cabin noise and improving ground clearance. The aircraft has a retractable tricycle landing gear and has a ground roll of 1,785 ft (544 m) on takeoff. The high aspect ratio wings use bonded construction techniques. The ICAO designator for the Cessna Conquest as used in flight plans is C441.  Operational history  A row of Cessna 441 from Skippers Aviation in Perth By May 2019, 290 aircraft remained in service, at a $.75-.9M value down from $1-1.9M in 2011. The King Air B200 has a roomier cabin but less range, a slower cruise and higher fuel burn. The Mitsubishi MU-2B-60 has a similar fuel burn and speed but flies lower. The Piper Cheyenne III is fast but has poorer fuel efficiency and less range. The Piper Cheyenne 400 is faster but burns fuel like a light jet. The Conquest is operated by corporate owners, air charter operators and previously by the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Australia. Examples of the type have been exported to many countries including Austria, Australia, Canada, Ecuador, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Mexico, Norway, Peru, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

A pretopological space can be defined as in terms of either filters or a preclosure operator. The similar, but more abstract, notion of a Grothendieck pretopology is used to form a Grothendieck topology, and is covered in the article on that topic. Let X be a set. A neighborhood system for a pretopology on X is a collection of filters N(x), one for each element x of X such that every set in N(x) contains x as a member. Each element of N(x) is called a neighborhood of x. A pretopological space is then a set equipped with such a neighborhood system. A net xŒ± converges to a point x in X if xŒ± is eventually in every neighborhood of x. A pretopological space can also be defined as (X, cl ), a set X with a preclosure operator (ƒåech closure operator) cl. The two definitions can be shown to be equivalent as follows: define the closure of a set S in X to be the set of all points x such that some net that converges to x is eventually in S. Then that closure operator can be shown to satisfy the axioms of a preclosure operator. Conversely, let a set S be a neighborhood of x if x is not in the closure of the complement of S. The set of all such neighborhoods can be shown to be a neighborhood system for a pretopology. A pretopological space is a topological space when its closure operator is idempotent. A map f : (X, cl ) ‚Üí (Y, cl' ) between two pretopological spaces is continuous if it satisfies for all subsets A of X: : f (cl (A)) ‚äÜ cl' (f (A)) .

Early life Gari was a popular singer and songwriter from the late 1950s and early 1960s. His best known songs as a performer are \\"Utopia\\", \\"Lullaby of Love\\", and \\"Princess\\", all of which hit the U.S. Billboard top 40 charts in 1961. Contributing to this early acclaim was Gari's unique rich voice blending with carefully selected melodic instrumentation and backup singers, all of which created a deep sense of magic, ethereal perfection, sincerity and emotion. With song writing partner Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, they wrote the song \\"Beach Ball\\" while working with singer Bobby Darin. Gari and McGuinn appeared on Capitol Records billed as the City Surfers. Frank performed his records on shows such as The Merv Griffin Show, The Steve Allen Show, and American Bandstand. He also performed at the world-famous \\"Empire Room\\" of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City with the Woody Herman Band. That year, he moved to Cleveland, becoming a jingle writer for television commercials. Some of his early jingles were for Ohio Bell, Genie garage doors, and early commercials for Wendy's. Frank has won numerous Emmy and Clio awards, and was later honored with the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award from the broadcast industry. News music compositions Gari is best known today as a music composer and producer for television, and is also one of the most sought after composers of music for television newscasts in America. His first television theme and image campaign was the popular \\"Catch 5\\", originally written for WEWS-TV in Cleveland in 1970. = \\"Hello...\\" image campaign. = Gari created and produced the \\"Hello\\" image campaign, which has been described as \\"one of the most popular local television campaigns ever made\\". Betraying the exclusivity implicit in the opening lyric of \\"There's a feeling in the air/that you can't get anywhere but (location)...\\", the campaign was recorded with localized lyrics and imagery in approximately 120 media markets across the United States, Canada, Latin America, and Australia. It debuted in 1977 as \\"Hello Milwaukee\\" for WISN-TV. In 2014, Gari was interviewed about the campaign on This American Life,https://www.thisamericanlife.org/520/no-place-like-home Episode 520 (\\"No Place Like Home\\") after host Ira Glass interviewed a fan of \\"Hello Calgary.\\" Glass surprised the fan with other markets' variants - dashing his belief that the song had been exclusive to his hometown. While the lead female vocalist for many renditions was Florence Warner, markets also used local performers including KUTV-TV in Utah, which aired a version recorded by The Osmonds. = Works for ABC and other US Networks = He continued composing music for the American Broadcasting Company during the early and mid-1980s, and created such campaigns as \\"We're With You on ABC\\", \\"Now is the Time, ABC is the Place\\", and \\"Come On Along with ABC\\" with Artie Schroeck, as well as \\"That Special Feeling on ABC\\", and \\"You'll Love it on ABC\\" (which was based on the Randy Newman composition, I Love L.A.) . He also composed music for Eyewitness News on ABC such as WABC-TV, ABC's Good Morning America (in 1989), CBS This Morning, The Phil Donahue Show, and The Oprah Winfrey Show. = Works for International Networks = Gari also had international clientele: in 1993, he composed the \\"Sky Symphony\\" theme for BSkyB in Europe, and the 1995 \\"It's On Sky\\" (also known as \\"No Turning Back\\") image piece. The Sky signature from the 1990s was spread to all the Sky channels, including Sky One, Sky Movies, and the defunct Sky Soap and Sky Movies Gold. Sky News used \\"The Great News Package\\" as their main theme from 1989 (when they launched their four-channel Astra lineup) until September 1993, and continued to use it (for main news bulletins on Sky News only) alongside the 'Sky Symphony' until 1995. He also composed the early 1990s theme for RTL in Germany called \\"News Line\\", which was later adopted by Maryland Public Television in the United States, and in the Philippines it was adapted for the primetime newscast TV Patrol on ABS-CBN.

Relations were strong under traditional governments in Venezuela, such as those of Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez and Rafael Caldera. However, tensions increased after the socialist President Hugo Ch√°vez assumed elected office in 1999.

On 26 January 2019, Maduro backtracked the request which defused the situation from a few days earlier with the request of the embassy staff to leave. Maduro's government was in a 30-day talk with the Trump Administration to open a U.S. Interest Office on 26 January.  19th century  During the Spanish American wars of independence, the United States was officially neutral but permitted Spanish American agents to obtain weapons and supplies. With the reception of Manuel Torres in 1821, the Gran Colombia (present-day Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, northern Peru, Venezuela, western Guyana and northwest Brazil) became the first former Spanish colony recognized by the United States, and the United States was the second government (after the Kingdom of Brazil) to recognize an independent Spanish American state. At that time, mutual relations have existed since the U.S. established a diplomatic mission in Santa Fe de Bogota in 1823. The next year the Anderson‚ÄìGual Treaty became the first bilateral treaty the U.S. concluded with another American country. U.S. relations with the governments in Bogot√°, Quito and Caracas were not interrupted when Ecuador and Venezuela left the federation in 1830. Roosevelt Corollary and Dollar Diplomacy The Venezuela Crisis of 1902‚Äì03 saw a naval blockade of several months imposed against Venezuela by Britain, Germany and Italy because of President Cipriano Castro's refusal to pay foreign debts and damages suffered by European citizens in a recent Venezuelan civil war. Castro assumed that the United States' Monroe Doctrine would see that the U.S. prevent European military intervention, but at the time the U.S. saw the Doctrine as concerning European seizure of territory, rather than intervention per se. Though U.S. Secretary of State, Elihu Root, characterized Castro as a \\"crazy brute\\" or a \\"monkey\\", President Theodore Roosevelt was concerned with the prospects of penetration into the region by Germany. With Castro failing to back down under U.S. pressure and increasingly negative British and American press reactions to the affair, the blockading nations agreed to a compromise, but maintained the blockade during negotiations over the details. This incident was a major driver of the Roosevelt Corollary and the subsequent U.S. Big Stick policy and Dollar Diplomacy in Latin America. When American diplomat, Herbert Wolcott Bowen, returned to Venezuela in January 1904, he noticed Venezuela seemed more peaceful and secure. Castro would reassure Bowen that the United States and Venezuela were experiencing a strong relationship. However, after the Castro regime delayed fulfilling the agreements which ended the Venezuelan crisis of 1902‚Äì03, Bowen lost confidence. This would eventually lead to the Castro regime's economic policy angering the United States, France, and the Netherlands. See p. 483. This would play a crucial role in the Dutch‚ÄìVenezuelan crisis of 1908.  Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez dictatorship (1953‚Äì1958)  Dictator Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez overthrew the elected president, R√≥mulo Gallegos, and seized power in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat. During this prosperity, foreign investment, particularly from American oil companies, grew along with the support from the Jim√©nez Regime. The anti-communist regime allowed and supported the exploitation of the country's natural resources by the American oil industry, as a portion of the profits made its way from companies like Mobil and Exxon to the personal coffers of P√©rez Jim√©nez.https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1952-54v04/comp21 P√©rez Jim√©nez received the Legion of Merit from the U.S. government in 1954. The , headed by , disappeared and tortured thousands of Venezuelans, both in its headquarters in Caracas and in a confinement camp on in the jungles of the Orinoco. After the 1958 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat, when P√©rez Jim√©nez abandoned the government and the country on 23 January 1958, more than 400 prisoners were found in the basement of the headquarters of the Seguridad Nacional.  Puntofijo Pact  Relations have traditionally been characterized by an important trade and investment relationship and cooperation in combating the production and transit of illegal drugs and were strong under the Puntofijo Pact governments in Venezuela, such as those of Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez and Rafael Caldera. Presidency of Hugo Ch√°vez After Hugo Ch√°vez was first elected President of Venezuela by a landslide in 1998, the South American country began to reassert sovereignty over its oil reserves. This action challenged the comfortable position held by U.S. economic interests for the better part of a century. The Ch√°vez administration overturned the privatization of the state-owned oil company PDVSA, raising royalties for foreign firms and eventually doubling the country's GDP. Those oil revenues were used to fund social programs aimed at fostering human development in areas such as health, education, employment, housing, technology, culture, pensions, and access to safe drinking water. Ch√°vez's public friendship and significant trade relationship with Cuba and Fidel Castro undermined the U.S. policy of isolating Cuba; moreover, on Chavez's initiative, long-running ties between the U.S. and Venezuelan militaries were severed. During Venezuela's presidency of OPEC in 2000, Ch√°vez made a ten-day tour of OPEC countries. In the process, he became the first head of state to meet Saddam Hussein since the Gulf War. The visit was controversial in the U.S., although, Ch√°vez did respect the ban on international flights to and from Iraq as he drove from his previous stop in Iran.‚Äì Chavez's tour of OPEC nations arrives in Baghdad. CNN. 10 August 2000 = Vargas tragedy = During the evacuation of survivors of the Vargas tragedy, when torrential rains and the flash floods and debris flows in the Vargas State in 2000 killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed thousands of homes, a disaster relief team from the United States headed up by New Mexico State Senator Joseph Carraro arrived with a medical team and supplies to assess the damage and help those who were displaced. Contact was made with Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico to determine any radioactive activity included in debris field. Water purification and sleeping units were provided. The disaster clean-up soon became politicized. Ch√°vez initially accepted assistance from anyone who offered, with the United States sending helicopters and dozens of soldiers that arrived two days after the disaster. When defense minister Ra√∫l Salazar complied with the offer of the United States' further aid that included 450 Marines and naval engineers aboard the USS Tortuga which was setting sail to Venezuela, Ch√°vez told Salazar to decline the offer since \\"[i]t was a matter of sovereignty\\". Salazar became angry and assumed that Ch√°vez's opinion was influenced by talks with Fidel Castro, though he complied with Ch√°vez's order. Though additional aid was necessary, Ch√°vez thought a more revolutionary image was more important and the USS Tortuga returned to its port. =United States interference allegations= In April 2002, 19 people died in the Llaguno Overpass events in Venezuela, which resulted in Chavez' removal from power while an interim government led. After returning to power, Ch√°vez claimed that a plane with U.S. registration numbers had visited and been berthed at Venezuela's Orchila Island airbase, where Ch√°vez had been held captive. On 14 May 2002, Ch√°vez alleged that he had definitive proof of U.S. military involvement in April's coup. He claimed that during the coup, Venezuelan radar images had indicated the presence of U.S. military naval vessels and aircraft in Venezuelan waters and airspace. The Guardian published a claim by Wayne Madsen alleging U.S. Navy involvement. U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd, D-CT, requested an investigation of concerns that Washington appeared to condone the removal of Mr Chavez, which found that \\"U.S. officials acted appropriately and did nothing to encourage an April coup against Venezuela's president\\" nor did they provide any naval logistical support.U.S. Embassy, Caracas, Venezuela.

Ch√°vez also denounced the U.S.-backed ouster of Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February 2004.

CNN (10 August 2000). Retrieved 1 July 2006. The Bush administration consistently opposed Ch√°vez's policies. Although it did not immediately recognize the Carmona government upon its installation during the 2002 attempted coup, it had funded groups behind the coup, speedily acknowledged the new government and seemed to hope it would last. The U.S. government called Ch√°vez a \\"negative force\\" in the region, and sought support from among Venezuela's neighbors to isolate Ch√°vez diplomatically and economically. One notable instance occurred at the 2005 meeting of the Organization of American States. A U.S. resolution to add a mechanism to monitor the nature of American democracies was widely seen as an attempt at diplomatically isolating both Ch√°vez and the Venezuelan government. The failure of the resolution was seen by analysts as politically significant, evidencing widespread support in Latin America for Ch√°vez, his policies, and his views. The U.S. also opposed and lobbied against numerous Venezuelan arms purchases made under Ch√°vez. This includes a purchase of some 100,000 rifles from Russia, which Donald Rumsfeld implied would be passed on to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and the purchase of aircraft from Brazil. The U.S. has also warned Israel to not carry through on a deal to upgrade Venezuela's aging fleet of F-16s. In August 2005, Ch√°vez rescinded the rights of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents to operate in Venezuelan territory, territorial airspace, and territorial waters. While U.S. State Department officials stated that the DEA agents' presence was intended to stem cocaine traffic from Colombia, Ch√°vez argued that there was reason to believe the DEA agents were gathering intelligence for a clandestine assassination targeting him, with the ultimate aim of ending the Bolivarian Revolution. When a Marxist insurgency picked up speed in Colombia in the early 2000s, Chavez chose not to support the U.S. in its backing of the Colombian government. Instead, Chavez declared Venezuela to be neutral in the dispute, yet another action that irritated American officials and tensed up relations between the two nations. The border between Venezuela and Colombia was one of the most dangerous borders in Latin America at the time, because of Colombia's war spilling over to Venezuela. Ch√°vez dared the U.S. on 14 March 2008 to put Venezuela on a list of countries accused of supporting terrorism, calling it one more attempt by Washington, D.C. to undermine him for political reasons.Venezuela dares U.S. to put it on terror list CNN (14 March 2008).

Bush a pendejo (\\"jerk\\" or \\"dumbass\\"); in a later speech, he made similar remarks regarding Condoleezza Rice. President Barack Obama called Ch√°vez \\"a force that has interrupted progress in the region\\". In a 2006 speech at the UN he referred to Bush as \\"the Devil\\" while speaking at the same podium the US president had used the previous day claiming that \\"it still smells of sulphur\\". He later commented that Barack Obama \\"shared the same stench\\". During his weekly address Al√≥ Presidente of 18 March 2006, Ch√°vez responded to a White House report which characterized him as a \\"demagogue who uses Venezuela's oil wealth to destabilize democracy in the region\\". During the address Ch√°vez rhetorically called George W.

Ch√°vez himself denounced Robertson's call as a harbinger of a coming U.S. intervention to remove him from office. Ch√°vez reported that Robertson, member of the secretive and elite Council for National Policy (CNP) ‚Äì of which George Bush, Grover Norquist, and other prominent neoconservative Bush administration insiders were also known members or associates ‚Äì was guilty of \\"international terrorism\\". Robertson subsequently apologized for his remarks, which were criticised by Ted Haggard of the U.S.-based National Association of Evangelicals. Haggard was concerned about the effects Roberson's remarks would have on US corporate and evangelical missionaries' interests in Venezuela. = Relations with Cuba and Iran = Ch√°vez's warm friendship with former Cuban President Fidel Castro, in addition to Venezuela's significant and expanding economic, social, and aid relationships with Cuba, undermined the U.S. policy objective seeking to isolate the island. In 2000 Venezuela stepped in to bolster the Cuban crisis arising from the fall of the Soviet Union. Venezuela agreed to provide Cuba with a third of its oil needs, at a 40% discount supplemented by a subsidized loan, the value of which was estimated at about $1.5-billion per year. In return, Cuba was to deliver doctors to work in Venezuela. The Venezuela assistance to the Cuban economy was estimated at between $10 billion to $13 billion annually between 2010 and 2013. Ch√°vez consolidated diplomatic relations with Iran, including defending its right to civilian nuclear power. Venezuela severed diplomatic relations with Israel in January 2009. =Organization of American States= At the 2005 meeting of the Organization of American States, a United States resolution to add a mechanism to monitor the nature of democracies was widely seen as a move to isolate Venezuela.

He contended that Caulfield had possibly met with opposition Venezuelans in exile in Puerto Rico; an official spokeswoman from the United States said Caulfield was there for a wedding. Chavez used the occasion to accuse \\"the empire\\" of using Puerto Rico as a base for actions against him and Latin America. He referred to Puerto Rico as a \\"gringo colony\\" and that one day the island would be liberated. Presidency of Barack Obama During the 2008 U.S. election, Ch√°vez declared that he had no preference between Barack Obama and John McCain stating \\"the two candidates for the US presidency attack us equally, they attack us defending the interests of the empire\\". After Obama had won the election, Venezuela's foreign minister labeled the outcome an historic moment in international relations and added that the American people had chosen a \\"new brand\\" of diplomacy. When Chavez was asked if the previously expelled ambassadors for each country would return, he replied \\"everything has its time.\\" However, at a rally the evening before the 4 November elections where Ch√°vez was supporting his own candidates Ch√°vez echoed a sentiment by Lula of Brazil and Morales of Bolivia, referencing the change happening in Latin America seemed to be taking place in the US. He expressed hope that he would meet with Obama as soon as possible. However, on 22 March 2009, Ch√°vez called Obama \\"ignorant\\" and claimed Obama \\"has the same stench as Bush\\", after the US accused Venezuela of supporting the insurgent Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).

The Empire of the Yankees. They are the main terrorists of the world\\", he added, referring to the U.S. \\"The Yankee empire will fall. It's already falling, and will disappear from the face of the Earth, and it's going to happen this century.\\" On 20 December 2011, Ch√°vez called Obama \\"A clown, an embarrassment, and a shame to Black People\\" after Obama criticized Venezuela's ties with Iran and Cuba. Venezuela and the United States have not had ambassadors in each other's capitals since 2010. Shortly before the 2012 US presidential elections, Ch√°vez announced that if he could vote in the election, he would vote for Obama. In 2013, before Hugo Chavez died, Venezuelan Vice President Nicol√°s Maduro expelled two U.S. military attaches from the country, saying they were plotting against Venezuela by attempting to recruit Venezuelan military personnel to destabilize Venezuela and suggested they caused Chavez's cancer. The Obama Administration rejected the allegations and responded by expelling two Venezuelan diplomats. President Barack Obama signed the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014, a U.S. Act imposing sanctions on Venezuelan individuals held responsible by the United States for human rights violations during the 2014 Venezuelan protests, in December of that year. It \\"requires the President to impose sanctions\\" on those \\"responsible for significant acts of violence or serious human rights abuses associated with February 2014 protests or, more broadly, against anyone who has directed or ordered the arrest or prosecution of a person primarily because of the person's legitimate exercise of freedom of expression or assembly\\". The Act was extended in 2016 to expire on 31 December 2019. On 2 February 2015, the United States Department of State imposed visa restrictions on current and former Venezuelan officials that were allegedly linked to presumed human rights abuses and political corruption. The visa restrictions also included family members, with the Department of State saying, \\"We are sending a clear message that human rights abusers, those who profit from public corruption, and their families are not welcome in the United States\\". Obama issued Executive Order 13692 in March 2015, which blocks assets or imposes travel bans on those \\"involved in or responsible for the erosion of human rights guarantees, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, use of violence and human rights violations and abuses in response to antigovernment protests, and arbitrary arrest and detention of antigovernment protestors, as well as significant public corruption by senior government officials in the country.\\" Under EO 13692, the Obama administration sanctioned seven individuals, and the Trump administration has sanctioned 73 as of 8 March 2019. In December 2011, Ch√°vez already under treatment for cancer and wondered out loud: \\"would it be so strange that they‚Äôve invented the technology to spread cancer and we won‚Äôt know about it for 50 years?‚Äù The Venezuelan president was speaking one day after Argentina's leftist president, Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, announced she had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. This was after three other prominent leftist Latin America leaders had been diagnosed with cancer: Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff; former Paraguayan president, Fernando Lugo, and the former Brazilian leader, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. The Guardian newspaper's Venezuela expert, Rory Carroll, has glibly categorized serious charges that Venezuela's late President Hugo Chavez Frias was assassinated by a United States-produced bio-weapon as being in the same league with \\"conspiracy theorists who wonder about aliens at Roswell and NASA faking the moon landings\\". A number of Venezuelan officials believe a hostile party covertly introduced an aggressive form of cancer into the 58-year-old president. Presidency of Nicol√°s Maduro On 1 October 2013, the US ordered three Venezuelan diplomats out of the country in response to the Venezuelan government's decision to expel three US officials from Venezuela. On 16 February 2014, President Maduro announced he had ordered another three US consular officials to leave the country, accusing them of conspiring against the government and aiding opposition protests. Maduro described the US statements that claimed to be concerned with rising tensions and protests and warned against Venezuela's possible arrest of the country's opposition leader as \\"unacceptable\\" and \\"insolent.\\" He said, \\"I don't take orders from anyone in the world.\\" On 25 February 2014, the United States responded by expelling three additional Venezuelan diplomats from the country. On 28 May 2014, the United States House of Representatives passed the Venezuelan Human Rights and Democracy Protection Act (H.R. 4587; 113th Congress), a bill that would apply economic sanctions against Venezuelan officials who were involved in the mistreatment of protestors during the 2014 Venezuelan protests.

Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro denounced the sanctions as an attempt to topple his socialist government. Washington said that the sanctions targeted individuals who were involved in the violation of Venezuelans' human rights, saying that \\"we are deeply concerned by the Venezuelan government's efforts to escalate intimidation of its political opponents\\". The move was denounced by other Latin American countries.

Venezuela's Defense Minister, Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez, immediately criticized Trump for his statement, calling it \\"an act of supreme extremism\\" and \\"an act of madness.\\" The Venezuelan Communications Minister, Ernesto Villegas, said Trump's words amounted to \\"an unprecedented threat to national sovereignty\\". President Maduro's son, Nicol√°s Maduro Guerra, stated during the 5th Constituent Assembly of Venezuela session that if the United States were to attack Venezuela, \\"the rifles would arrive in New York, Mr. Trump, we would arrive and take the White House.\\" =2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis= 23 January 2019 communication from National Assembly to ambassadors On 23 January 2019, Maduro announced that Venezuela was breaking ties with the United States following President Trump's announcement of recognizing Juan Guaid√≥, the leader of Venezuela's National Assembly, as the interim President of Venezuela. Maduro said all US diplomats must leave within 72 hours, but Guaid√≥ said that they should stay. Maduro later confirmed the closure of the Venezuelan Embassy and all consulates in the United States. In response Maduro ordered the expulsion of US diplomats, giving them 72 hours to leave Venezuela. The US said it would not close its embassy, stating their diplomatic relationship was with Guaid√≥'s government, and holding Maduro responsible for the safety of its staff. On 26 January 2019, only hours before the deadline, the Maduro government backtracked on its expulsion order, giving US diplomats another 30 days. President Donald Trump warned Venezuelan soldiers to renounce loyalty to Nicol√°s Maduro. The last U.S. diplomats in Caracas left Venezuela on Thursday, 14 March, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Their departure put an end to a U.S. presence in Venezuela, after president Maduro effectively broke off diplomatic relations with the U.S. in late January. On 5 April 2019, the United States signed a protecting power agreement with Switzerland to represent its interests in Venezuela, however, the agreement is not yet operational as it has not been approved by Maduro's government due to the United States rejecting Maduro's government's proposal to have Turkey as its protecting power as the United States only recognizes Guaid√≥ as interim president. In the meantime, the United States has instead established a \\"Venezuela Affairs Unit\\" section at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, Colombia to serves as an interim diplomatic office to Venezuela. In the spring of 2020 the United States stepped up pressure on Maduro.

Coins produced at the Denver Mint bear a D mint mark (not to be confused with the mark of the Dahlonega Mint). The Denver Mint is the single largest producer of coins in the world. History =Clark, Gruber & Co.= Clark, Gruber & Company gold coins on display at the History Colorado Center‚Äîa pair of $10 coins at left, and $20 coins at right, also known as eagles and double eagles, respectively The predecessors of the Denver Mint were the men of Clark, Gruber and Company. During the Pikes Peak Gold Rush, they coined gold dust brought from the gold fields by the miners. In 1858, Austin M. Clark, Milton E. Clark and Emanuel Henry Gruber founded a brokerage firm in Leavenworth, Kansas, and then established an office in Denver at the beginning of the Colorado Gold Rush. Desiring to save on shipping and insurance costs associated with shipping gold back east, the firm opened a private mint. On 25 July 1860, the mint opened in a two-story brick building on the corner of Market and 16th Streets, minting $10 gold pieces at the rate of \\"fifteen or twenty coins a minute\\". \\"On the face is a representation of the peak, its base surrounded by a forest of timber and 'Pikes Peak Gold' encircling the summit. Immediately under its base is the word 'Denver', and beneath it 'Ten D.'. On the reverse is the American Eagle encircled by the name of the firm 'Clark, Gruber & Co.', and beneath the date, '1860'.\\" A $20 gold coin was added, \\"the weight will be greater, but the value the same as the United States coin of like denomination\\". A $5 and a $2.5 gold coin were added, with production reaching $18,000 per week. On the front was the \\"head of the Goddess of Liberty surrounded by thirteen stars, with \\"Clark & Company\\" in the tiara. \\"Pikes's Peak Gold, Denver\\" was on the other side, with \\"5D.\\" or \\"2 1/2 D.\\" In the almost three years of operation, they minted $594,305 worth of Pike's Peak Gold in the form of gold coins. Additionally, they purchased 77,000 troy ounces of raw gold, and shipped \\"large amounts of dust\\" to the Philadelphia Mint. The building, assaying and minting equipment was formally bought by the US Treasury in April 1863. Clark, Gruber & Co. remained a bank until bought by the First National Bank of Denver in 1865. =Act of Congress 1862= The Denver Mint in a May 1972 photograph Established by an Act of Congress on April 21, 1862, the United States Mint at Denver opened for business in late 1863 as a United States Assay Office. Operations began in the facilities of Clark, Gruber and Company, located at 16th and Market Streets and acquired by the government for $25,000, which it was simply able to print off at the location. Unlike Clark, Gruber and Company, though, the Denver plant performed no coinage of gold as first intended. One reason given by the Director of the Mint for the lack of coinage at Denver was, \\"‚Ä¶the hostility of the Indian tribes along the routes, doubtless instigated by rebel emissaries (there being a Civil War) and bad white men.\\" Gold and nuggets brought there by miners from the surrounding area were accepted by the Assay Office for melting, assaying, and stamping of cast gold bars. The bars were then returned to the depositors as imparted bars stamped with the weight and fineness of the gold. Most of the gold came from the rich beds of placer gold found in the streams and first discovered in 1858, the same year Denver was founded. When the supply of gold was exhausted from the streams, the emphasis turned to lode mining, uncovering veins of ore with a high percentage of gold and silver. By 1859, the yearly value of the gold and silver deposited at the Assay Office was over $5.6 million. During its early years as an Assay Office, the Denver plant was the city's most substantial structure. The United States Treasury did not expand its smelting and refining operations at the same rate as the discovery and production of gold. In 1872 a group of businessmen led by Judge Hiram Bond (formerly one of the largest brokers on the New York Gold Exchange), Joseph Miner and Denver Mayor Joseph E. Bates set up a firm Denver Smelting and Refining Works which built an independent complementary plant which processed ore into ingots which were then assayed, weighed and stamped by the Denver Mint. There was new hope for branch mint status when Congress provided for the establishment of a mint at Denver for gold and silver coin production. The site for the new mint at West Colfax and Delaware streets was purchased on April 22, 1896, for approximately $60,000. Construction began in 1897. Appropriations to complete and equip the plant were insufficient, and the transfer of assay operations to the new building were delayed until September 1, 1904. Coinage operations finally began on February 1, 1906, advancing the status of the Denver facility to Branch Mint. In addition, before the new machinery to be used at the Mint was installed for use, it was first sent to the St. Louis Exposition of 1904 for display. Silver coins were minted in Denver for the first time in 1906. During the first year, 167 million coins were produced, including $20 gold (double eagle) coins, $10 gold (eagle) coins, $5 gold (half eagle) coins, and assorted denominations of silver coins.

Early life and playing career Boras was born in Sacramento and grew up in Elk Grove, California, the son of a dairy farmer. He attended the University of the Pacific and made the baseball team as a walk on. He led the team with a .312 batting average in 1972. As of 2009, Boras was in the top 10 in school history in multiple offensive categories. Boras was inducted into the Pacific Athletics Hall of Fame in 1995, and the baseball team's annual \\"Most Improved Player\\" award is named in his honor. Following his college career, Boras played four years of minor league baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs organizations. Boras made the Florida State League All-Star team in 1976, but knee problems shortened his career and he retired with a career batting average of .288. Boras received his Doctor of Pharmacy degree from the University of the Pacific in 1977. Following his playing career, Boras returned to the University of the Pacific, earning his Juris Doctor degree from the university's McGeorge School of Law in 1982. After law school, Boras worked as an associate in the pharmaceutical defense department of the Chicago firm Rooks, Pitts & Poust (now Dykema Gossett), defending drug companies against class-action lawsuits. Boras Corporation Boras's start as an agent came representing Mike Fischlin, a former major league shortstop for the Cleveland Indians, and Bill Caudill, a former minor league teammate and closer for the Seattle Mariners, both of whom now work for Boras. By 1980, he had decided his calling was as a baseball agent. In 1983, Boras negotiated one of the largest contracts in baseball history for Caudill ($7.5 million), and not long afterward Boras left his law firm job to represent players full-time. Today, Boras is the president and owner of the Boras Corporation, a baseball-only sports agency. In 2014, the Boras Corporation was named by Forbes magazine as the most valuable single-sport agency in the world. Boras and his company Boras Corporation have become known for record-setting contracts for their free agent and amateur draft clients. Boras was the first baseball agent to negotiate contracts in excess of $50 million (Greg Maddux, five years, $57.5 million in 1997), $100 million (Kevin Brown, seven years, $105 million in 1998) and $200 million (Alex Rodriguez, 10 years, $252 million in 2000). Boras also represents many of the elite players in each year's amateur draft and has been a strong advocate for increasing the amount of money they receive. Boras's first record-setting contract for a drafted player was $150,000 for Tim Belcher in 1983. Since then, Boras's clients have regularly pushed draft compensation higher, starting with Andy Benes in 1988 ($247,500), Ben McDonald in 1989 ($1.01 million guarantee, including a $350,000 bonus), Todd Van Poppel in 1990 ($1.2 million guarantee, including a $500,000 bonus) and Brien Taylor in 1991 ($1.55 million) and continuing through J. D. Drew ($8.5 million in 1998) and Mark Teixeira ($9.5 million in 2001). In 2009, Boras's clients broke several draft records, led by Stephen Strasburg, who surpassed the $15 million barrier with the largest contract in draft history ($15.1 million), Donavan Tate, who received the largest signing bonus ever given to a high school player ($6.25 million), and Jacob Turner, who received the largest signing bonus ever given to a high school pitcher ($4.7 million). The Boras Corporation operates out of a $20 million, , two-story, glass-and-steel building in Newport Beach, California The corporate headquarters includes a kitchen, laundry room, gym, shower, lounge, 70 flat-screen televisions and a large patio with a tall waterfall, fire pit and barbecue. Boras's subsidiary companies include Boras Marketing (memorabilia, marketing, and endorsements) and the Boras Sports Training Institute (strength/conditioning and sports psychology). Many of Boras's 75-person staff are former major leaguers, including Bob Brower, Don Carman, Bill Caudill, Scott Chiamparino, Mike Fischlin, Calvin Murray, Jeff Musselman, Domingo Ramos and Kurt Stillwell, and the company has scouts spread across the United States, Asia and Latin America. Boras's staff also includes an MIT- trained economist, a former NASA computer engineer, three lawyers, five personal trainers, an investment team (although Boras's firm does not provide investment services for clients),as stated by himself, in an interview on \\"The Game 365\\" on the MSG Network a sports psychologist, a 14-person research staff and an employee charged with watching each day's games and sending information to Boras. High-profile negotiations Over the course of his 31 years as a sports agent, Boras has represented hundreds of players on all 30 major league teams and has participated in dozens of high-profile negotiations. Boras's specialty is the record-breaking contract, which he says is the most difficult to achieve because it then provides an \\"umbrella\\" from which other players can benefit. Boras is well known for identifying sources of leverage for his clients and using them for the clients' advantage. This has included advising draft picks to return to school instead of signing, taking advantage of the right to go to salary arbitration hearings, and advising superstars to wait for free agency instead of taking \\"hometown discount\\" contracts. This does not endear him to fans, who regularly side with their favorite teams and not individual players. Boras, however, has said his job is to represent his clients' interests, even if it means weathering public criticism. Boras's innovative strategies have benefited his clients enough that Major League Baseball has changed its rules in response to his actions on multiple occasions. This has led to descriptions of Boras ranging from \\"baseball's most hated man\\" (from management's perspective) to the man \\"players can't afford to live without.\\"Scott Boras, Motherhood, and Apple Pie ‚Äì By Bryan Curtis Slate MagazineAgent Scott Boras is changing the business of baseball US News and World Report =1980s= * Boras's first major contract showdown was between Bill Caudill and the Toronto Blue Jays in February 1985. Caudill was eligible for salary arbitration, and Boras negotiated a $1.5 million contract that made Caudill the second-highest paid reliever in the game. * In 1988, Boras represented the top three picks in the amateur draft: Andy Benes, Mark Lewis and Steve Avery. Benes signed for a $235,000 bonus, the largest in baseball history at the time. * The next year, in 1989, Boras negotiated the first multi-year major league contract ever given to a baseball-only amateur, a $1.01 million deal for first overall pick Ben McDonald with the Baltimore Orioles, which included a $350,000 signing bonus. =1990s= * In 1990, Boras stunned baseball officials by securing a record $1.2 million guaranteed major league contract for the #14 pick in the draft, high school pitcher Todd Van Poppel. The contract included a $500,000 signing bonus. * In 1991, Boras again set a record by securing a $1.55 million bonus from the New York Yankees for high school phenomenon Brien Taylor. * In 1992, Boras negotiated a record five-year, $28 million contract for Greg Maddux with the Atlanta Braves, eclipsing the second-best offer by $9 million. The contract trailed only David Cone's contract in terms of annual value and was two years longer. * In 1993, Boras represented the first two picks in the draft, Alex Rodriguez and Darren Dreifort. Both eventually received $1.3 million contracts, although Rodriguez signed against Boras's advice. Boras was demanding a $3 million deal, and nearly prevented Rodriguez from signing at all. * In 1996, Boras used an obscure provision in the major league rules to have draft picks Matt White (seventh overall pick, San Francisco Giants) and Bobby Seay (12th overall pick, Chicago White Sox) declared free agents. White and Seay both then signed with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays, with White receiving a $10.2 million contract and Seay receiving a $3 million bonus, significantly more than what they would have received via the draft process. The following year, Major League Baseball changed its rules in response to Boras's success in circumventing the draft, which had resulted in at least $25 million in extra money for his clients. For many years, being \\"outsmarted\\" by Boras and losing Seay remained a sore spot for White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, one of Commissioner Bud Selig's closest allies. * In 1997, Boras advised draft pick J. D. Drew not to accept the Philadelphia Phillies' $3 million offer. Drew instead signed a professional contract with the independent St. Paul Saints. Boras and the MLBPA then filed a grievance to have Drew declared a free agent since only \\"amateurs\\" could be subject to what was then known as the \\"amateur draft\\". Boras won the argument, but the arbitrator ruled he could not grant Drew free agency since he was not a member of the MLBPA. Instead, Drew re- entered the draft the following year and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals for nearly three times the Phillies' best offer. Major League Baseball again was forced to amend its rules because of Boras; the draft is now called the \\"First Year Player Draft\\" as a result of the Drew grievance. * Following the 1997 season, Boras broke the $50 million barrier by negotiating a five-year, $57.5 million contract for Greg Maddux with the Atlanta Braves, making Maddux the highest paid player in the game. * Only a year later, in 1998, Boras broke the $100 million barrier by negotiating a seven-year, $105 million contract for Kevin Brown with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Brown dethroned Maddux as the highest-paid player in the game. * Also in 1998, Boras negotiated a seven- year, $87.5 million contract for Bernie Williams to stay with the New York Yankees, even though the Yankees had made a public statement that they would not exceed $60 million for Williams. * In 1999, Boras filed a grievance on behalf of Adri√°n Beltr√© because the Los Angeles Dodgers falsified Beltr√©'s Dominican Republic birth records prior to signing him in 1994. Team representatives changed the records in order to sign Beltr√© when he was only 15 (under baseball rules international prospects are not eligible to sign until they are 16). In response to Boras's grievance, Commissioner Bud Selig awarded Beltr√© damages of $48,500. Additionally, Selig imposed significant penalties on the Dodgers. * Other Boras clients in the 1990s included Keith Hernandez, Alex Fernandez, Charles Johnson, Robb Nen, Jay Bell and Jim Abbott. =2000= * In 2000, under Boras's supervision, high school prospect Landon Powell earned his GED following his junior year of high school and then filed the necessary paperwork to make him eligible for that year's draft. Powell went undrafted, since the major league teams did not expect him to be draft eligible, making him a free agent. Whether because of Powell's ability, his pricetag, or internal resentment within Major League Baseball about his successful end-run around the draft, Powell did not sign, instead enrolling at the University of South Carolina. * At the baseball Winter Meetings following the 2000 season, Boras negotiated two record-breaking contracts for clients who had gone first and second overall in the 1993 draft. The former second pick, Darren Dreifort, was the first to sign, with Boras finalizing a five- year, $55 million contract for Dreifort to stay with the Los Angeles Dodgers on December 11. * One day later, on December 12, Boras finalized what was then the largest contract in professional sports history, a 10-year, $252 million contract for former first overall pick Alex Rodriguez to play for the Texas Rangers. The contract doubled the previous record for an American team sport, Kevin Garnett's $126 million contract with the Minnesota Timberwolves, and exceeded the price owner Tom Hicks had paid for the entire Rangers franchise three years earlier. =2001= * In February 2001, Boras and Andruw Jones defeated the Atlanta Braves in salary arbitration, with Jones earning an arbitration-record $8.2 million salary in only his second year of arbitration eligibility. The Jones decision remained the largest salary arbitration win for any player in history until 2008. * The Texas Rangers and Boras engaged in another high-profile negotiation after the June 2001 draft. Boras negotiated a $9.5 million, four-year major league contract for fifth overall pick Mark Teixeira. * In December 2001, Boras and free agent Barry Bonds, the reigning National League MVP, surprised the San Francisco Giants by accepting the club's offer of salary arbitration. Boras eventually negotiated a five-year, $90 million contract for the 37-year-old slugger. =2002= * In December 2002, for the second year in a row, a Boras free agent client surprised his former team by accepting salary arbitration. This time, it was Greg Maddux accepting the offer from the Atlanta Braves. Boras eventually negotiated a record-breaking $14.75 million contract for the star pitcher, at the time the largest one-year contract in baseball history. =2003= * In December 2003, Boras was a part of the complex multi-party negotiations that would have resulted in Alex Rodriguez being traded from the Texas Rangers to the Boston Red Sox. Boras and Rodriguez offered to accept $12 million in reduced salaries in return for marketing rights and the right for Rodriguez to be a free agent after the 2005 season. The trade was eventually killed by the MLBPA because it would have cost Rodriguez $30 million in previously guaranteed compensation, setting a bad precedent (from the union's perspective) regarding the renegotiation of guaranteed contracts. =2004= * In February 2004, Boras again negotiated regarding a trade for Alex Rodriguez, this time successfully from the Texas Rangers to the New York Yankees. Once again, because of the complexity of Rodriguez's contract, several contractual modifications were necessary for the trade to happen, but unlike the prior year, none of the changes sacrificed previously guaranteed compensation. * Boras represented the two consensus top prospects in the 2004 draft, Stephen Drew and Jered Weaver. The San Diego Padres had the first pick in the draft and were prepared to select Drew or Weaver, but Padres owner John Moores ordered the team to select Matt Bush in order to save money. Drew eventually received a $5.5 million major league contract from the Arizona Diamondbacks and was their starting shortstop from his major league debut in 2006 until his trade to the Oakland Athletics in 2012. Weaver eventually received a $4 million bonus from the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and won 16 games in 2009. Bush has hit .219 for his career, was converted to a pitcher, endured a series of off-field legal problems, and was cut by Toronto in 2009 for their zero-tolerance behavior policy. On January 28, 2010, Bush signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays with an invite to spring training. Bush didn't make his debut until he was 30 years old in 2016 for the Texas Rangers. * Following the 2004 season, Boras negotiated a five-year, $55 million contract for J. D. Drew to play for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Boras included the right to opt out of the contract after two years, which Drew used effectively after the 2006 season. * In mid-December 2004, Boras brokered a five-year, $64 million contract for Adri√°n Beltr√© with the Seattle Mariners. * Later that month, Boras negotiated a four-year, $40 million contract for Boston Red Sox catcher and team captain Jason Varitek to return to the team. =2005= * In January 2005, Boras negotiated his third contract in excess of $100 million, this time sending Carlos Beltr√°n to the New York Mets for $119 million guaranteed over seven years. * A few days later, Boras negotiates a four-year $36 million contract for Derek Lowe with the Los Angeles Dodgers. * The next month, Boras negotiated another contract with a potential value in excess of $100 million, when Magglio Ord√≥√±ez agreed to a five-year, $75 million contract with two vesting option years that push the potential value to $105 million over seven years. The contract was complicated by language allowing the Tigers to void the contract after the 2005 season if Ord√≥√±ez's previous knee problems returned. * Also in February 2005, Boras won a salary arbitration case for Kyle Lohse against the Minnesota Twins. Lohse received a raise from $395,000 to $2.4 million. * In December 2005, Boras negotiated a four-year, $52 million contract for Boston Red Sox center fielder Johnny Damon to join the rival New York Yankees. The Red Sox had failed to improve their $40 million offer, thinking Boras was bluffing. * Also in December 2005, Boras landed a five- year, $60 million contract for Kevin Millwood with the Texas Rangers, despite Millwood's history of arm trouble. The deal gave the Rangers the ability to void the final year of the contract (2010) if Millwood did not meet certain innings totals. However, Millwood met the required threshold in September 2009. =2006= * In February 2006, Boras won a salary arbitration hearing for Kyle Lohse for the second year in a row, defeating the Minnesota Twins and earning Lohse a raise to $3.95 million. Lohse became the first player to win back-to-back arbitration cases since 1991. * In June 2006, Boras client and former University of Tennessee star pitcher Luke Hochevar was selected first overall in the draft by the Kansas City Royals. Hochevar eventually signed a four-year major league contract for $5.2 million guaranteed, with the opportunity to make up to $7 million. The contract vindicated Boras's advice; at the prompting of a different agent, Hochevar had nearly accepted a $2.98 million offer from the Los Angeles Dodgers the previous September. Boras advised Hochevar to decline the offer. * Following the 2006 season, Boras advised J. D. Drew to opt out of the final three years and $33 million remaining on his contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Boras then negotiated a five-year, $70 million contract for Drew with the Boston Red Sox. The contract was not finalized until January 26, 2007, because Boras and the Red Sox had to develop special contract language regarding potential injury to Drew's shoulder. Drew had the shoulder surgically repaired earlier in his career. * On December 14, 2006, after weeks of speculation, public posturing, and intensely scrutinized negotiations, Boras finalized a six-year, $52 million contract for Japanese superstar pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka to play for the Boston Red Sox. Matsuzaka was not a free agent (the Red Sox paid an additional $51.1 million to his Japanese team for exclusive negotiating rights), meaning Matsuzaka's only alternative to signing with the Red Sox was to return to Japan. * Two weeks later, on December 28, 2006, Boras negotiated a record-breaking seven-year, $126 million contract with the San Francisco Giants for Barry Zito. The contract was the largest ever given to a pitcher in baseball history. =2007= * The 2007 collective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the MLBPA imposed an August 15 deadline for draft picks to sign. This was in direct response to Boras's successful strategy of advising draft picks like Jason Varitek, J. D. Drew, Stephen Drew, Jered Weaver, Luke Hochevar and Max Scherzer to wait as long as possible to sign and marked at least the third time baseball rules were changed because of Boras. * On August 13, 2007, Boras finalized a record-breaking $7.3 million contract with the Detroit Tigers for the 27th overall draft pick, Rick Porcello. The four-year major league contract, which could end up paying Porcello over $10 million, was the largest contract ever given to a high school player. * On October 28, 2007, Boras and New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez exercised the right to opt out of Rodriguez's original 10-year, $252 million contract, with three years and $72 million remaining. Boras and Rodriguez were criticized for the timing of the decision, which leaked during Game 4 of the 2007 World Series. Rodriguez met with Yankees officials in Miami, and afterward Rodriguez instructed Boras to finalize a record-breaking 10-year, $275 million contract. Boras and the Yankees then crafted a series of unique marketing bonuses that will pay Rodriguez an additional $30 million for tying and surpassing Willie Mays, Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron, and Barry Bonds on the all-time home run list. The high-profile opt-out and negotiations strained Boras and Rodriguez's relationship, and Rodriguez hired Madonna's manager to be his marketing representative, but Boras retained his role as Rodriguez's baseball agent and has since reported that their relationship is \\"repaired\\". * In December 2007, Boras negotiated a two-year, $36.2 million contract for Andruw Jones with the Los Angeles Dodgers, making Jones the fifth highest paid player in the major leagues despite a .222 batting average during the 2007 season. Following a poor 2008 season, Boras negotiated Jones's release from the Dodgers in January 2009 in return for deferring the remaining money owed on the contract. Jones then signed a minor-league contract with the Texas Rangers. =2008= * On July 31, 2008, Boras negotiated away the option years on Manny Ramirez's contract with the Boston Red Sox as part of Ramirez's trade to the Los Angeles Dodgers, making Ramirez a free agent after the 2008 season, two years early. * On August 15, 2008, negotiations between Boras and the Pittsburgh Pirates regarding second overall draft pick Pedro Alvarez went up to (and beyond) the midnight deadline for draft picks to sign. Major League Baseball unilaterally extended the deadline, and Boras and the MLBPA filed a grievance. After weeks of legal wrangling, Alvarez signed a major league contract for $6.355 million. * In December 2008, Boras negotiated an eight- year, $180 million contract for Mark Teixeira with the New York Yankees, making Teixeira the highest-paid first baseman in baseball history and the third highest-paid player in all of baseball, behind only Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter. =2009= * In January 2009, Boras negotiated a four-year, $60 million contract with the Atlanta Braves for Derek Lowe and a three-year, $36 million contract with the New York Mets for √ìliver P√©rez. * In February 2009, Boras secured a two-year, $45 million deal for Manny Ramirez with the Los Angeles Dodgers. * In August 2009, Boras negotiated the largest contract in draft history for first overall pick Stephen Strasburg, a $15.1 million major league contract with the Washington Nationals. * Several other Boras clients also signed record-breaking deals following the 2009 draft, including Donavan Tate's $6.25 million signing bonus with the San Diego Padres (largest ever for a high school player), Jacob Turner's $4.7 million signing bonus with the Detroit Tigers (largest ever given to a high school pitcher, part of a major league contract that could pay Turner an additional $4 million) and second- overall pick Dustin Ackley's $6 million signing bonus (tied for the largest upfront bonus in history, part of a major league contract worth up to $10 million with $7.5 million guaranteed). =2010= * In January 2010, Boras negotiated a seven-year, $120 million contract with the St. Louis Cardinals for Matt Holliday, the largest contract in team history. * In August 2010, Boras brokered a record five-year, $9.9 million deal for the #1 overall pick in the draft, 17-year-old Bryce Harper, with the Washington Nationals. It marked the second year in a row Boras and the Nationals collaborated on a record deal for the top overall pick in the draft. Harper's contract set a new standard for position players in the draft, breaking the previous record held by Boras's deal for Mark Teixeira in 2001. Like fellow Boras client Landon Powell in 2000, Harper earned his GED early in order to enter the draft sooner than would otherwise have been possible. * Harper led a series of Boras clients who signed high-profile contracts at the top of the draft, including #3 overall pick Manny Machado, #4 overall pick Christian Colon, #7 overall pick Matt Harvey, #24 overall pick Gary Brown, and Anthony Ranaudo, the Red Sox' sandwich round pick who was considered the top college pitcher in the country heading into the 2010 season. * In November 2010, the New York Times ran an article about loans Boras's firm made to a Dominican client, Edward Salcedo, over a period of several years. Boras dismissed the Salcedo loans as a \\"non-issue\\" that complied with the MLBPA's rules. Salcedo himself also disputed the Times' report. Subsequent analysis by the baseball press supported Boras's position, leading at least one prominent commentator to question the agenda underlying the Times' reports. * On December 5, 2010 Boras negotiated a seven-year, $126 million contract for Jayson Werth with the Washington Nationals, only three months after Werth hired him. The contract tied for the third largest in baseball history for an outfielder, trailing only Manny Ramirez's contract with the Boston Red Sox and Alfonso Soriano's contract with the Chicago Cubs. =2011= * On January 3, 2011, Boras finalized a seven-year, $80 million contract for Carlos Gonz√°lez with the Colorado Rockies. Gonzalez won Gold Glove and Silver Slugger awards in 2010, his first full season in the major leagues. * Two days later, on January 5, Boras finished negotiations on a six-year, $96 million contract for Adri√°n Beltr√© with the Texas Rangers, the second major free agent contract of Beltr√©'s career. Beltr√© previously signed for five years and $64 million with the Mariners, starting with the 2005 season. After that contract finished with an injury year for Beltr√©, Boras negotiated a one-year, $10 million contract with the Boston Red Sox for 2010 that included a player option for 2011. Boras recommended that Beltr√© take a short-term deal, calling it a \\"pillow contract\\" that gave Beltr√© a soft landing while he restored his market value. Boras's inclusion of a player option allowed Beltr√© to play without fear of injury (what Boras called a \\"calamity scenario\\"), since at worst Beltr√© could exercise the option and guarantee himself $5 million for 2011. Beltr√© proved not to need the insurance, as he was an All-Star for Boston, finishing 9th in AL MVP voting. Following the season Beltr√© declined the option, which had doubled to $10 million once he hit 640 plate appearances. Beltr√© and Boras then leveraged Beltr√©'s rebound season into an additional year and $32 million more from the Rangers than Beltr√© received from the Mariners in 2004, even though Beltr√© entered the Rangers contract six years older. * On January 15, Boras completed a three-year, $35 million contract for Rafael Soriano to pitch for the New York Yankees. The deal is notable for Soriano's right to opt out of the contract following each season, effectively giving Soriano the power to leave the Yankees and seek a larger contract elsewhere without sacrificing the full guaranteed value should he suffer injury or poor performance. Soriano would use this to opt out following the 2012 season. * On January 18, Boras negotiated a one-year arbitration settlement for Prince Fielder with the Milwaukee Brewers that will pay him $15.5 million in 2011, his last year of arbitration eligibility. The settlement was the largest single-season arbitration contract in Major League history, 24% larger than the previous record of $12.5 million, negotiated by Boras for Mark Teixeira in 2008. It also made Fielder the highest-paid player in Brewers history. * Boras and his firm negotiated roughly $444.5 million in contracts during the 2010‚Äì2011 offseason, over $120 million more than any other firm. * On March 7, 2011 former University of Kentucky baseball player James Paxton signed with the Seattle Mariners for $942,500. Paxton had previously sued Kentucky over the NCAA's demand (through the school) that he reveal the contents of his conversations with Boras, an attorney. The issue arose because Toronto Blue Jays President Paul Beeston suggested in a media interview that he had communicated with Boras regarding Paxton. Paxton refused to submit to the interview sought by the NCAA, citing the due process protections in UK's student code of conduct. Under threat from the NCAA, the school refused to clear Paxton to play. Paxton had previously turned down approximately $874,000 from the Blue Jays before signing with the Mariners. * On June 6, 2011, Gerrit Cole was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates with the first overall pick in the draft, marking the third consecutive year a player advised by Boras was selected first overall. (Stephen Strasburg was selected #1 in 2009, followed by Bryce Harper in 2010.) On August 15, Boras negotiated an all-time record bonus of $8 million for Cole, surpassing the $7.5 million Boras negotiated for Strasburg in 2009. * Also on August 15, 2011, Boras negotiated a record contract for Bubba Starling, a high school phenom with a football scholarship to the University of Nebraska, who was selected fifth overall by the Kansas City Royals. Starling received a $7.5 million signing bonus, the second largest in draft history (behind only the bonus Boras negotiated for Cole, and tied with the bonus Boras negotiated for Strasburg). Starling's bonus was also the largest ever for a high school player (surpassing the $6.5 million bonus Boras negotiated for Tate in 2009), and the largest ever for a high school player (surpassing Tate and Harper). His contract also represented the most guaranteed money ever given to a high school player (surpassing Porcello). * Boras also negotiated a four-year major league contract worth a guaranteed $7.2 million for Anthony Rendon, 2010 winner of the Dick Howser Trophy (\\"the Heisman Trophy of college baseball\\") as the top player in the country, who was drafted sixth overall by the Washington Nationals. * Boras client Josh Bell received a record-breaking signing bonus of $5 million from the Pirates, who had drafted him in the second round. The bonus was over $1.5 million more than any other player had received outside the first round. With the deals for Cole and Bell, Boras negotiated more from Pirates in 2011 than any other team had ever spent on its entire draft (50+ rounds). * Finally, Boras negotiated $3 million bonuses for Brian Goodwin from the Washington Nationals and Austin Hedges from the San Diego Padres, each tied for the third-highest bonuses in draft history outside the first round, and negotiated a bigger bonus for Alex Meyer ($2 million from the Nationals) than four other college pitchers selected ahead of Meyer in the 2011 draft. =2012= * On January 24, 2012, Boras secured a nine-year, $214 million contract for Prince Fielder with the Detroit Tigers, the fourth-largest contract ever for a baseball player. The deal surprised many in the industry with its length, its size, and the identity of the signing team, as it appeared that Boras might be boxed in by a lukewarm market for Fielder. With the Fielder deal, Boras became responsible for three of the four $200 million-plus deals in the history of the game (the other two being Alex Rodriguez's deals with the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees). * In June, Boras advised five first-round draft picks: Albert Almora, Mark Appel, Addison Russell, Corey Seager, and Deven Marrero. * Boras negotiated a $3,900,000 bonus for Almora from the Chicago Cubs as the sixth overall pick. The deal was $650,000 above the recommended \\"slot value.\\" * Pundits ranked Appel as the top prospect available in the draft. However, the Houston Astros selected Carlos Correa first overall and signed him to a contract for $2.4 million below his \\"slot value.\\" * The Astros' savings from signing Correa and other players below their slot values ended up going to Boras advisees Lance McCullers, Jr. and Rio Ruiz. McCullers was the Astros' supplemental first round pick, and received a bonus of $2.5 million, or $1.24 million above \\"slot value.\\" Ruiz was the Astros' 4th round pick, and received a bonus of $1.85 million or $1.5 million above \\"slot value.\\" * The Pirates selected Appel eighth overall. Appel chose to return to school rather than sign for the 8th pick's \\"slot value\\" of $2.9 million. The Astros then selected Appel first overall in the 2013 draft, and he signed with Houston for $6.35 million. * The Oakland A's selected Russell 11th and he signed for $2.625 million. The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Seager 18th and he signed for $2.35 million, $400,000 above \\"slot value.\\" The Boston Red Sox selected Marrero 24th and he signed for $2.05 million, $300,000 above \\"slot value.\\" Of the five first round picks who received above their \\"slot value\\" in 2012, three of the five were Boras advisees. * On December 10, Boras completed a six-year, $36 million contract for Hyun-Jin Ryu with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ryu had been pitching for the Hanwha Eagles in Korea, and the Dodgers paid $25.7 million for the exclusive right to sign him. Ryu's contract also contains innings bonuses worth up to $1 million per year, and other salary escalators. Ryu also can opt out of the contract if the Dodgers trade him, or after the 2017 season if he has reached 750 innings pitched in his career. =2013= * In February, Boras negotiated a four-year, $48 million contract for Michael Bourn with the Cleveland Indians. In March, Boras secured a three-year, $33 million contract for Kyle Lohse from the Milwaukee Brewers. Both players were subject to draft pick compensation under new rules that Boras dismissed as \\"corrupt\\" because they do not \\"reward performance.\\" * In March, Boras secured an eight-year, $120 million extension for Elvis Andrus with the Texas Rangers. The contract covered the 2013‚Äì2022 seasons. Andrus would otherwise have been a free agent after the 2014 season. Both Rangers GM Jon Daniels and Boras called the contract \\"unusual.\\" It contained a vesting option that could raise the value to $135 million over nine years. It also allowed Andrus to opt out following the 2018 and 2019 seasons, when he will be 29 or 30 years old. Andrus also received no-trade protection and award bonuses worth up to $800,000 per year. * In June, Boras advised four first round draft picks: Mark Appel, Kris Bryant, Sean Manaea, and Michael Lorenzen. * Boras negotiated a $6.35 million bonus for Appel as the #1 pick, by the Astros. That more than doubled what Appel turned down from the Pirates the year before. * Boras also negotiated the largest bonus of any player in the draft ($6,708.400) for Bryant, selected #2 by the Cubs. * The Royals selected Manaea 34th overall, knowing he needed hip surgery before he could play again. Boras negotiated a bonus of $3.55 million, almost $2 million above \\"slot value.\\" * Boras negotiated a $1.5 million bonus for Lorenzen from the Reds as the #38 pick, roughly $30,000 above \\"slot value\\". * In July, Boras negotiated a $1.625 million bonus from the Chicago Cubs for Jen-Ho Tseng, an 18-year-old pitcher from Taiwan who pitched in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. * Also in July, rapper and novice sports agent Jay-Z mentioned Boras in a song on his new album, referencing the decision by Robinson Can√≥ to go with Jay-Z rather than Boras and accusing Boras of being \\"over baby.\\" Boras declined to respond, instead telling the media he preferred the music of longtime client Bernie Williams. * On December 3, Boras negotiated a seven-year, $153 million contract for Red Sox center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury to join the rival New York Yankees. An option year could raise the total value to $169 million over eight years. The Red Sox had offered Ellsbury a below-market $100 million contract and were outbid by the Yankees in an echo of Damon's 2005 deal. Both were top-of-the-order outfielders represented by Boras, fresh off a championship with Boston. Mainstream media described the deal as a \\"monster\\" and \\"brain-melting.\\" * On December 21, Boras completed a seven-year contract for free agent Shin-Soo Choo with the Texas Rangers. The contract guaranteed Choo $130 million. Entering the offseason, MLB general managers suggested in the media that Choo's value was much lower. They cited Michael Bourn's four-year $48 million contract, or B.J. Upton's five-year, $75 million contract as the proper barometer for Choo. Instead, Choo became the first player without an All-Star appearance to sign a contract worth $100 million or more. =2014= * In 2014, two Boras free agent clients, Stephen Drew and Kendrys Morales, did not sign until late May and early June respectively. Both players were subject to draft pick compensation under MLB rules, dampening their market. Boras criticized the compensation rules, while the MLBPA launched an investigation into team conduct. The rules, which Boras dismissed as \\"corrupt\\" the previous winter, also hurt the market for players Boras did not represent, like Nelson Cruz, Ubaldo Jim√©nez, and Ervin Santana. All three signed one-year deals before the start of the 2014 regular season. That meant all three were again exposed to the draft pick compensation rules following the 2014 season. By waiting to sign, Drew and Morales avoided any draft pick compensation following the 2014 season. * In June, teams selected five Boras clients in the first round of the draft: Carlos Rodon, Alex Jackson, Michael Conforto, Erick Fedde, and Matt Chapman. * Boras negotiated the largest bonus of any player in the draft for Rodon, $6.582 million for the #3 selection from the Chicago White Sox. Rodon's bonus was also $860,500 above the \\"slot value\\" recommended by Major League Baseball. For comparison, the players selected #2 and #4 accepted bonuses $821,800 and $1,496,200 below \\"slot value.\\" * Boras also brokered deals for Jackson, Conforto, Fedde, and Chapman. Jackson received a $4,200,000 bonus to sign with the Mariners as the #6 selection, $624,100 above the \\"slot value.\\" Conforto received $2,970,800 (exactly \\"slot value\\") from the Mets at #10. Fedde, who underwent Tommy John surgery just days before the draft, received $2,511,100 ($365,500 above slot value) from the Nationals at #18. Chapman received $1,750,000 from the Oakland A's at #25. =2015= * On January 19, 2015, Boras negotiated a 7-year, $210 million contract with the Washington Nationals for free agent Max Scherzer, who turned down at least $144 million from the Detroit Tigers before the 2014 season. Boras helped Scherzer secure insurance against an injury suffered before free agency. =2019= * On February 28, 2019, Boras negotiated what was at the time (until Mike Trout's contract extension broke the record 19 days later) an MLB record 13-year, $330 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies for free agent Bryce Harper. This contract is not only significant for what was at the time record breaking money, but the inclusion of a no trade clause and no opt out clauses, meaning Harper will play for the Phillies until 2031. *On December 2, 2019, third baseman Mike Moustakas signed a 4-year, $64 million deal with the Cincinnati Reds. *On Monday, December 9, 2019, Boras negotiated what was at the time the largest contact for a pitcher in both total value and average annual value at $245 million over 7 years with the Washington Nationals for free agent Stephen Strasburg. The contract beat out David Price‚Äôs $217 million contract in total value and Zach Greinke‚Äôs $31.5 million per year contract in average annual value. The contract had a full no-trade clause and $80 million in deferred payments to be paid by 2029. *Just a day later on December 10, 2019, Boras once again set records when he landed free agent Gerrit Cole a contract with the New York Yankees worth $324 million over 9 years. This contract became the largest ever given to a pitcher in terms of total salary and average annual value, at $36 million, beating out Stephen Strasburg, as well as the fourth largest contract in MLB history. The contract includes a full no trade clause as well as a player option after the 2025 season.https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/11/gerrit-cole-agrees-to- historic-324-million-deal-with-yankees-reports.html *Just one day after that on December 11, Boras signed free agent third baseman Anthony Rendon to a 7-year, $245 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels. With the signing, Boras had signed his clients to $814 million in contracts in just three days. *On December 21, starting pitcher Dallas Keuchel was signed to the White Sox for 3-year and $55.5 million. *Left-handed Korean starting pitcher Ryu Hyun- jin signed a 4-year, $80 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays on December 27, 2019. With the signing, Boras's clients have signed contracts totaling more than $1 billion ($1,013,500,000) in three weeks for the month of December.

Among the best-known products made by Fender were the Telecaster, the Broadcaster and the Esquire. Because of the great popularity of these models, musicians are listed here only if their use of this instrument was especially significant-- that is, they are players with long careers who have a history of faithful Telecaster use, or the particular guitar they used was unique or of historical importance, or their use of the Telecaster contributed significantly to the popularization of the instrument. Esquire players are here listed alongside players of the more famous Telecaster, since Fender regards it as part of the \\"family of Telecaster guitars\\". While the one-pickup Esquire has been marketed as a separate model from the two-pickup Telecaster (which was originally named the Broadcaster) since its reintroduction in 1951, the Esquire and Telecaster are so intimately linked in their development and history, and so similar in design and tonal characteristics, that they are considered variations of the same model.  A-E  * Syd Barrett (1946‚Äì2006), guitarist/singer/songwriter of the band Pink Floyd; used a unique mirror-disk covered EsquireAlthough Barrett's mirror-disk guitar has been called a Telecaster in several sources, a photograph shows clearly that it has no neck pickup, and is therefore an Esquire. See: and a 1960s-era Tele Custom. * Phil Baugh (1936‚Äì1990), a hot country guitarist whose song \\"Country Guitar\\" with Verne Stovall, recorded on his Telecaster, was a hit in 1964 and earned him numerous awards. He worked as a popular session guitarist in Nashville from 1975 until his death in 1990.Phil Baugh at Guitar PlayerPhil Baugh at Sundazed Records * Jeff Beck (born 1944) Emerging in the mid 1960s with The Yardbirds, Beck proved that a ragged Fender Esquire could moan like a fuzzed-out violin. His lines in ‚ÄúHeart Full of Soul‚Äù and ‚ÄúEvil Hearted You‚Äù defined psychedelic guitar. * Ed Bickert (1932-2019) was a premier jazz player who started playing a Telecaster when his regular guitar was in the shop, and he used it for the rest of his career.Guitar Player Magazine, July, 1987, pp. 56, 57 * Frank Black (born 1965) of the Pixies is a long-time Telecaster player. *Mike Bloomfield (1943‚Äì1981) played a Telecaster on the first album by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, considered a groundbreaking example of post-Chicago electric blues. He employed the same instrument on Bob Dylan's hit single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and the album Highway 61 Revisited. Most famously, Bloomfield played his Telecaster on stage with Dylan at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, at which Dylan \\"went electric\\" to much controversy among his fans. * * D. Boon (1958-1985) of the Minutemen (band) was a revolutionary guitarist in the hardcore/post-punk scene where the jangly tone of his Telecaster and his funky rhythm was paired with the thumping bass riffs of best friend Mike Watt to create an entirely new sound that couldn't be classified as punk, funk or hardcore. He would play with very high treble and essentially no middle or bass, cultivating a juxtaposition between his abrasive guitar tone and Watt's bass. D. Boon would play with such control and power over the guitar, dancing with it like a toy, playing it violently and effortlessly as if it were an air guitar. * Jimmy Bryant (1925‚Äì1980), a prolific session musician, was given one of the first Broadcasters by Fender engineer George Fullerton. Fullerton compared this gift to \\"starting a prairie fire,\\" and said that \\" pretty soon we couldn't make enough of those guitars.\\" * Roy Buchanan (1939‚Äì1988), a blues/rock musician whose playing inspired the likes of Jeff Beck, earning him the title \\"The Guitarist's Guitarist's Guitarist,\\" was a faithful Tele man during his solo career. * Jeff Buckley (1966‚Äì1997), an American singer- songwriter and guitarist, used a borrowed '83 toploader Telecaster that became a staple of his performances and recordings. * James Burton (born 1939) has played a Telecaster since he was 13, and he has influenced many other guitarists.

His most famous guitar is the Paisley Red Tele, which he first used while performing with Elvis Presley. He has also played with Gram Parsons and Merle Haggard. As a long-time Tele player, he wrote a foreword to A. R. Duchossoir's book detailing the history of the guitar. * Mike Campbell (born 1950), best known for his work with Tom Petty, has stated that his 1950 Broadcaster has been one of his live mainstay guitars since the beginning of the Heartbreakers. On their first and second albums, he recorded most of his solos & rhythm parts on songs such as \\"American Girl\\", \\"Breakdown\\", and \\"I Need to Know\\" using his Broadcaster exclusively. Mike also played an early-'70s Telecaster with two humbuckers and Bigsby vibrato tailpiece nicknamed \\"Big Red.\\" * Jim Campilongo (born 1958) is a New York roots rock guitarist from San Francisco, known for recording a series of instrumental guitar albums and being a member of The Little Willies with Norah Jones. Campilongo plays a 1959 'top loader' Telecaster. He also plays Jim Campilongo signature guitars produced by the Fender Custom Shop which were modeled on his 1959 Telecaster. Campilongo cites Telecaster player Roy Buchanan as an important influence on his guitar technique. * Martin Carthy MBE (born 21 May 1941) is an English folk singer and guitarist who has remained one of the most influential figures in British traditional music. He played a blue Telecaster, with a white pickguard and two single-coil pickups, whilst a member of the renown British folk-rock band, Steeleye Span, from 1970-1972, 1977-1978 and 1999. * Albert Collins (1932‚Äì1993) (\\"The Master of the Telecaster\\") created his original blues sound using minor open tunings and a capo placed high up on the neck.

He uses a blonde 1968 Telecaster with a Gibson PAF Pickup, a 1960 Lake Placid blue Telecaster Relic, and a 1972 Telecaster Deluxe, while his time with Blur saw him use a reissue 1952 blonde Telecaster. * Steve Cropper (born 1941) creates rhythm work known to be spare and crisp using the bridge pickup of the Telecaster, playing with Stax session band Booker T. & the MGs, who backed such stars as Otis Redding and Sam & Dave. * Denny Dias of Steely Dan presaged the 1970s trend for dual- humbucker Teles by replacing both of the single coils in his guitar with humbuckers and installing a Stratocaster-style bridge. * Jerry Donahue (born 1946) of Fairport Convention released a solo album in 1986 called Telecasting and was a member of the Telecaster trio called the Hellecasters. * Bob Dylan (born 1941) owned a black-and-white early 1960s Telecaster with a maple cap fretboard, which became one of his first electric guitars, shaping his controversial electric sound.

However, his most iconic guitar is the Mojo Chessmaster, a lefty Telecaster with a custom body built for him by Chris Cush of the Mojo guitar shop. The Chessmaster (named by Flansburgh for its resemblance to a rook) has appeared in promotional images and music videos for the band from the early 90s up to 2018. * Bill Frisell (born 1951) jazz guitarist noted for his atmospheric legato sounds, has, for the last several years, used the Telecaster as his primary guitar.Bill Frisell * Noel Gallagher (born 1967) played 1960s Telecasters in the early 2000s with Oasis * Danny Gatton (1945‚Äì1994) played a customized '53 Tele whose specifications were replicated by Fender for his Signature model, including unique angled bridge saddles for improved intonation of the classic 3-saddle bridge, and use of Joe Barden pickups. * Vince Gill (born 1957), who replaced fellow Tele-player Albert Lee in Rodney Crowell's backing band, uses a '53 Telecaster as his primary stage guitar. * David Gilmour (born 1946) has used a Telecaster and Esquire from Fender in addition to his regularly used Fender Stratocaster.

Fender selected the better of two prototypes built, flew it to England in its own personal seat along with a courier, and hand-delivered the guitar to Apple offices in December 1968. Harrison used this guitar during The Beatles famous 'Get Back Sessions' as well as on the Beatles' 1970 album Let It Be and 1969's Abbey Road. Of equal notability, Harrison used the rosewood Tele for the Beatles' last public performance in 1969, famously referred to as 'the Rooftop concert'. Harrison subsequently gave this instrument to Delaney Bramlett. * PJ Harvey (born 1969) used to play a borrowed 1967 Telecaster (from friend John Parish) during her early career. In a 1995 interview to Guitar Player, she declared: \\"John's Telecaster is closer to my heart. It's on all my records ‚Äî I used to nick it all the time.\\" Later, in 2000, when she received the Mercury Music Prize, she bought her own 1960s Telecaster. * Robyn Hitchcock (born 1953) has used a Telecaster since 1979 for his distinctive English electric psychedelic sound, and said that it \\"... chose itself for me as my favourite electric guitar, because so many of my favourite guitar riffs were played on it.\\" * Steve Howe (born 1947) has used a 1955 Telecaster, customized with a different toggle switch and a humbucker in the neck position for the first time in the entire 1974 Yes album \\"Relayer\\", and after that frequently uses his Telecaster in various live performances and in several studio recordings. * Chrissie Hynde (born 1951) has often used her blue Telecaster with The Pretenders, and it was pictured on the jacket of their album Get Close. * Waylon Jennings (1937‚Äì2002), a country legend, played many 1953 Telecasters which were covered with white-and-black leather carved in an oak leaf and floral motif.

It was directed by Jonathan Demme. The movie was originally released as Citizens Band, and was later released in an edited version as Handle with Care. In the film, all of the cast of characters are known by their CB \\"handles\\" (nicknames). A paperback novelization of the film written by E.M. Corder was published by Pocket Books in 1977. Plot Paul Le Mat plays Spider, a young man who makes a meager living repairing CB radios and spends his spare time volunteering with REACT International. He lives with his father, an irascible retired truck driver (Roberts Blossom) whose CB handle is \\"Papa Thermodyne.\\" \\"Chrome Angel\\" (played by Charles Napier) is an interstate truck driver named Harold, passing through the outskirts of town during bad weather when he is injured in an accident. After Chrome Angel issues an emergency call over CB Channel 9, Spider rescues him, taking him to the hospital. During his recovery in town, Harold is visited by local prostitute Debbie (alias Hot Coffee‚Äîplayed by Alix Elias), who solicits customers over the CB radio. Chrome Angel has two wives, Connie (Marcia Rodd) who calls herself Portland Angel as she is from Portland, Oregon, and Joyce (alias Dallas Angel‚ÄîAnn Wedgeworth) who lives in Dallas, Texas, neither of whom knows he is married to the other. Both arrive in town at the same time while he is recovering. They not only discover that he has been seeing Hot Coffee, but during a conversation the two strike up in the bus station, meeting for the first time, they discover for the first time that they are married to the same man. Spider's former fiancee, Pam (Electra‚ÄîCandy Clark), is a cheerleading coach and physical education teacher who, unknown to Spider, has a hobby of her own, striking up erotic conversations over the CB with teenage boys. She is romantically interested in Spider's older brother, Dean (Bruce McGill), who goes by the CB handle Blood. After Spider's activities with REACT are seriously disrupted by a gang of local kids holding a frivolous conversation on Channel 9, which is reserved for emergency communications, he decides to go on a singlehanded county-wide crusade to shut down illegal CB stations, such as those using unlawful linear amplifiers. Spider's targets include The Red Baron (Harry Northup), a neo-Nazi who uses a high-powered CB base station to broadcast white supremacist monologues, and The Hustler, a teenage boy who reads pornography aloud over the air. Spider and a partner from REACT begin a spree of cutting antenna cables, intimidating offenders by visiting their homes and claiming to be Federal Communications Commission (FCC) officials, and other vigilante acts in the hopes of cleaning up the CB airwaves. As Chrome Angel's two wives learn they are both married to the same man, and Spider learns that his former fiancee is the infamous Electra, much of the last part of the film consists of the myriad complicated friendships and odd romantic relationships that finally come to a head. Finally, the whole town comes together in a search-and-rescue effort after Papa Thermodyne suddenly disappears. Cast Reception The film's initial release resulted in disappointing box-office results which led Paramount to reconsider its campaign and distribution strategy, including renaming the film to reduce the CB radio connection and as apparently some thought that the word \\"Band\\" in the title indicated it was a musical. The film was renamed Handle with Care for its New York Film Festival showing on September 30, 1977. The renaming did not boost its box office, and it grossed just $815,530 in the United States and Canada. Handle with Care currently holds a 100% rating at Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 7.9/10 among the critics. John Simon wrote of Citizen's Band: \\"a lovely, hilarious, semisatirical folk comedy, only needing a better ending.\\" In 2003, The New York Times placed the film on its Best 1000 Movies Ever list.The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made.

Its gameplay was heavily inspired by Nintendo Entertainment System game Zelda II: Adventure of Link, and it featured an original story described on the manual. Unlike the other LCD games, this was made by Nintendo and appeared on a Nintendo platform. The handheld console would be Nintendo's penultimate release before the release of the Game Boy (the last being Mario The Juggler). =Gameplay= Players control Link and fight through labyrinth chambers on the Game & Watch's lower screen. In the labyrinth chambers, Link faces Poe-like Ghosts, up to four Stalfos, and a Moblin-like Goblin mini-boss.Á¨¨15Âõû „Ç≤„Éº„É†ÔºÜ„Ç¶„Ç©„ÉÉ„ÉÅ(ÂæåÁ∑®) „Ç≤„Éº„É†‰∫∫ÁîüÂõûÈ°ßÈå≤ - ‰π±ËàûÂêâÁî∞.

After they kidnap Princess Zelda, it is up to Link to defeat them and rescue the princess. The dragons have imprisoned Zelda behind a seal that requires all 8 pieces of the triforce to unlock. After defeating each dragon, Link gains one piece of the triforce. =Development and release= The Zelda Game & Watch was developed by Gunpei Yokoi and Nintendo R&D1.; =Reception= Zelda is thought to have pushed the limits of what is possible on the Game & Watch LCD format, though the gameplay is far simpler than the NES original. The game was noted in particular by Famitsu as having achieved the excitement and role-playing game-feel of the original series, however the game was criticized for being too easy if the player attained too many power-ups during play.

By as early as 2007, Stadlbauer and It's Outrageous! began distributing the Mini Classics version in select locations within the United States, using art from A Link to the Past and Four Swords Adventures. In October 2002, Nintendo included a port of the game as a hidden unlockable extra in Game & Watch Gallery 4 for the Game Boy Advance.

The game consists of four levels with four cavernous rooms each. In each cave, Link has to collect a boomerang and sword to defeat several enemies.

According to Billboard, \\"nobody has released more consistently excellent blues albums than Atlanta's Tinsley Ellis. He sings like a man possessed and wields a mean lead guitar.\\" Rolling Stone said, \\"On assertive originals and standards by the likes of Jimmy Reed and Junior Wells, Atlanta's Tinsley Ellis unleashes feral blues guitar. Nonstop gigging has sharpened his six-string to a razor's edge‚Ä¶his eloquence dazzles‚Ä¶he also achieves pyrotechnics that rival early Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton.\\" Biography His love for electric blues grew by listening to British Invasion bands such as the Yardbirds, the Animals, Cream, and the Rolling Stones. Ellis has stated that the first guitar playing he heard was songs like \\"Dirty Water\\" by The Standells, and \\"Secret Agent Man\\" by Johnny Rivers, but that he then \\"got into the real stuff\\" like Freddie King. Inspired by a live appearance by B.B. King, he was determined to become a blues guitarist. In 1975, he played with the Haygood Band while attending Emory University near Atlanta. Two years later, already an accomplished musician, he returned to Atlanta and joined his first professional blues band, the Alley Cats, a group that included Preston Hubbard of the Fabulous Thunderbirds. Ellis graduated from Emory in 1979 with a degree in history. In 1981, he formed the Heartfixers, with the singer and harmonica player Chicago Bob Nelson. The group recorded three albums for the small Landslide record label, one with the singer, Nappy Brown before breaking up in 1988. The same year, Ellis signed a recording contract with Chicago's Alligator Records. His debut solo album on Alligator Records, Georgia Blue, was released in 1988. Alligator then reissued two of his earlier CDs, Cool On It and Tore Up (featuring Nappy Brown). Ellis' next four releases were Fanning the Flames (1989), Trouble Time (1992), Storm Warning (1994), and Fire It Up (1997). Artists including Peter Buck (of R.E.M.), Derek Trucks, and Chuck Leavell joined him in the studio. He worked with the record producers, Eddy Offord and Tom Dowd. Ellis' reputation and media coverage continued to grow. He appeared on NBC-TV Sports during the network's 1996 Summer Olympics coverage. Ellis shifted to Capricorn Records in 2000 and released Kingpin. In 2002 he joined Telarc Records, producing two CDs: Hell or High Water and The Hard Way. All the while Ellis never stopped touring. \\"A musician never got famous by staying home,\\" Ellis says. Ellis claims to have performed live, at least once, in all 50 of the United States. He returned to Alligator Records in 2005 with the live album, Live! Highwayman. In 2007 he released the studio album, Moment of Truth, followed in 2009 with Speak No Evil. Ellis continues to tour over 150 nights a year around the world. He has shared stages with Warren Haynes, Widespread Panic, the Allman Brothers Band, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmy Thackery, Otis Rush, Willie Dixon, Son Seals, Koko Taylor, Albert Collins and Buddy Guy. In early 2013, Ellis was a part of the 'Blues at the Crossroads 2' tour which celebrated the music of Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. The tour also included Kim Wilson and the Fabulous Thunderbirds, James Cotton, Bob Margolin and Jody Williams. Also in 2013, Ellis launched his own label, Heartfixer Music, and has since released several albums: the all instrumental Get It!, Midnight Blue, Tough Love and, in 2016, Red Clay Soul. In 2014, Ellis was a guest performer on Eli Cook's album, Primitive Son. In 2017, Ellis launched a new side project called Tinsley Ellis Blues Is Dead, in which he performs the blues and R&B; songs recorded by Grateful Dead and other Fillmore era acts. Commenting on Ellis's latest album, Ice Cream in Hell, AllMusic stated \\"On Ice Cream in Hell, Ellis' songwriting and singing finally match the prowess in his playing, and we are all richer for it.\\" Discography *1986 ‚Äì Cool on It (with the Heartfixers) *1988 ‚Äì Georgia Blue *1989 ‚Äì Fanning the Flames *1992 ‚Äì Trouble Time *1994 ‚Äì Storm Warning *1997 ‚Äì Fire it Up *2000 ‚Äì Kingpin *2002 ‚Äì Hell or High Water *2004 ‚Äì The Hard Way *2005 ‚Äì Live!

The village of Clonbur sits between Lough Corrib and Lough Mask. Two kilometres to the west rises Mount Gable where, according to legend, the hordes of Firbolg gathered on the hilltop before their clash with the Tuatha D√© Danann at the Battle of Moytura. Clonbur also contains the ruins of the Petersburgh Estate, seat of the Lynch family, one of whose members, John Lynch, was a signatory of the American Declaration of Independence. In more recent times, it was owned by the Guinness family. Ross Hill Abbey In the Ross Hill cemetery of stands the ruins of Teampall Brendain. The ruin is sited within an ancient oval enclosure known as a Caiseal or Cashel. The western end of the ruin is of early Christian origin and in the trabeated doorway can clearly be seen the inclined jambs so distinctive of that era. This edifice replaced a wooden and less durable structure which was the Navigator's original monastic settlement on the site. Within 30 meters of the western doorway is a curiosity locally known as The Ogham Stone. The site, in the Ross Hill estate, was once the property of the unpopular Earl of Leitrim. The estate later became the property of the Guinness family. Ballykine (Ballykyne) Castle Poliska House in An Fhairche (Clonbur) One of a series of five fortifications from Ballinrobe to Ballindonage, it was originally owned by the O'Kynes. In 1571 it was seized for the Crown by Fitton, the then President of Connacht. For a period the de Burgos held it and later gave it to the MacDonnells (Scottish mercenaries) as service booty or bonnacht. Eventually it passed from Sir Richard O'Donnell to Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness and so became part of the Guinness estate. Architecturally, the castle has some puzzling features. The trabeated doorway with its inclined jambs pre-dates the rest of the structure by some 900 years. Certain sections of the stonework are not bonded together as a unit, a feature which suggests later additions to the original building. Lough Coolin Located at the foot of Mount Gable, three miles west of Clonbur in County Galway. Lough Coolin is accessible via the villages of Ballyveane and Kilbeg Upper. Beside the lake are the stone cottage ruins of an old village. The lake was renowned for white trout until the early 1960s when pike were added to the lake by a local fisherman. Pike and perch are now the only fish in the lake. A stream from the Lough Coolin flows into Lough Mask. Coolin Lake provides fresh water for the village of Clonbur. Mount Gable Mount Gable (1370 feet) is a hill which dominates the isthmus between Lough Corrib and Lough Mask and overlooks one of the major routes into Connemara from the east. The starting point for a walk is approximately 2 km from the village of Clonbur. It provides a backdrop for Lough Coolin. Views of both Lough Mask and Lough Corrib can be had from the top of Mount Gable. Mount Gable is accessible through the villages of Ballyveane and Kilbeg Upper.

He played for the Texas Rangers, Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and New York Yankees. Before his professional career, he played college baseball at Georgia Tech, where in 2000 he won the Dick Howser Trophy as the national collegiate baseball player of the year. One of the most prolific switch hitters in MLB history, Teixeira was an integral part of the Yankees' 27th World Series championship in 2009, leading the American League (AL) in home runs and runs batted in (RBI) while finishing second in the Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) balloting. Teixeira was a three-time All-Star, won five Gold Glove Awards and three Silver Slugger Awards, and also holds the all-time major league record for most games with a home run from both sides of the plate, with 14. He was the fifth switch hitter in MLB history to reach 400 home runs. Drafted fifth overall by the Texas Rangers in 2001, Teixeira made his MLB debut on Opening Day in 2003, and hit 26 home runs as a rookie. He hit career-highs of 43 home runs and 144 RBI in 2005. The centerpiece of consecutive mid-season trades in 2007 and 2008, the Rangers first sent him to the Braves for a prospect package centered around Elvis Andrus and Matt Harrison. He was later traded in July 2008 to the Los Angeles Angels, where he played for half a season and lost in the first round of the playoffs. In December 2008, he agreed to a lucrative eight-year contract with the Yankees, contributing his most productive season in pinstripes the following year. Injuries limited his effectiveness afterward, including a calf strain in 2012, early season-ending wrist surgery in 2013, various ailments in 2014, a shin fracture in 2015, and neck spasms and torn cartilage in 2016. Teixeira retired at the conclusion of the 2016 season and contract with the Yankees. In each season from 2004 to 2011, Teixeira hit at least 30 home runs with 100 RBI. Early life Mark Teixeira grew up in Severna Park, Maryland, the son of Margaret \\"Margy\\" Canterna and John Teixeira. He attended Mount Saint Joseph High School in Baltimore, where he played for the school's varsity baseball team, and was teammates with Gavin Floyd. His paternal grandfather emigrated from the South American country Guyana, and he has English and Portuguese ancestry through his father. Teixeira's mother is of Italian descent. College career Teixeira was originally chosen in the ninth round of the 1998 MLB draft by the Boston Red Sox. Teixeira chose not to sign with the Red Sox, however, opting instead to play college baseball for Georgia Tech citing that he didn't appreciate how the Red Sox treated him. In the summer of 1999, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he won the league's Outstanding Pro Prospect Award. Teixeira played college baseball at Georgia Tech. In 2000, his batting average was .427, and his on- base plus slugging (OPS) was 1.319. He also won the Dick Howser Trophy as the national collegiate baseball player of the year. Professional career =Minor Leagues= In 2001, Teixeira re-entered the draft and was selected by the Texas Rangers with the fifth overall pick. The Philadelphia Phillies considered selecting him with the fourth overall pick, but the demands of Teixeira's agent Scott Boras swayed the Phillies to select Gavin Floyd. The Rangers signed Teixeira to a Major League contract worth $9.5 million over 4 years. Teixeira began the 2002 season in the Florida State League, where he batted .320 with an OPS of 1.000 in 38 games. He was then moved up to the Double-A Tulsa Drillers, with whom he batted .316 with a .994 OPS and hit 10 home runs in 48 games. It turned out that 2002 would be his only season in the minor leagues; he made the Rangers out of spring training in 2003. Teixeira as a member of the Rangers. =Texas Rangers= As a rookie in 2003, Teixeira hit .259 with 26 home runs, 84 RBI, and a .811 OPS. Teixeira began to improve in 2004, batting .281 with an OPS of .930, 38 home runs, and 112 RBI. On August 17, 2004, Teixeira hit for the cycle. For his accomplishments in 2005, he earned the Silver Slugger Award as the best-hitting first baseman in the American League as well as the Gold Glove signifying his place as the best fielding first baseman in the American League. He was also named to his first All-Star Game after winning the fan voting portion of the selection to be named the starting first baseman for his league. During the game, Teixeira hit a home run from the right hand side of the plate, something he had failed to do in the entire first half of the season. In a five-game span around the All- Star Game, Teixeira hit five home runs with 13 RBI. He finished July with 13 home runs and 30 RBI and was named the American League Player of the Month. Overall, Teixeira batted .301 with 43 home runs and 144 RBI in the 2005 season. In 2005, Teixeira became the third switch-hitter in MLB history to hit at least 20 home runs in each of his first three seasons, after Eddie Murray and Chipper Jones. He is also one of just five players in Major League history to hit at least 100 home runs in his first three seasons, joining Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio, Ralph Kiner, and Eddie Mathews as well as current first base star, Albert Pujols. Other players ‚Äì Mark McGwire, Jos√© Canseco, Todd Helton, Ryan Howard ‚Äì have hit 100+ home runs in their first three full seasons, but these players had all played partial seasons prior to playing their first three full seasons. His 2005 total of 144 RBI is a Major League record for a switch-hitter. On Mother's Day, May 14, 2006, Teixeira was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished a pink bat to benefit the Breast Cancer Foundation. Teixeira's 2006 season began slowly, as he collected only nine home runs before the All-Star Break. After the All-Star Break, however, he was among the league's leaders in home runs, and again finished with over 30 homers and 100 RBI for the season. Teixeira agreed to a two-year $15.98 million contract before the 2006 season to avoid his first two years of arbitration. On June 9, 2007, Teixeira's franchise record 507 consecutive-game streak came to an end. Teixeira landed awkwardly at first base after running out a grounder in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers the previous day. The streak was second to Miguel Tejada at the time. The strained quadriceps muscle placed Teixeira on the disabled list for only the second time of his career. =Atlanta Braves= Teixeira with the Braves in 2008. On July 31, 2007, two weeks after turning down an eight-year, $140 million contract extension from the Rangers, Teixeira was traded to the Atlanta Braves (along with left-handed reliever Ron Mahay) for catcher/first baseman Jarrod Saltalamacchia, and four prospects: shortstop Elvis Andrus, and starting pitchers Matt Harrison, Neftal√≠ Feliz and Beau Jones. Teixeira was activated for that night's game against the Houston Astros and arrived in the dugout during the seventh inning. He was promptly shown on Turner Field's high definition video board and received a boisterous applause from the Atlanta crowd. In his Braves debut on August 1, 2007, Teixeira hit a 3-run homer and drove in 4 runs in a 12‚Äì3 rout of the Houston Astros. Teixeira went on to homer in each of the following two games, becoming just the second player to homer in his first three games as a Brave ‚Äì the first being Gary Sheffield in 2002. On August 19, 2007, Teixeira had his first multi-HR game against the Arizona Diamondbacks off Yusmeiro Petit. He would repeat that feat the next day, going deep for two three-run home runs versus the Cincinnati Reds. Teixeira, a switch-hitter, hit both homers on the 19th batting from the left side of the plate, and hit his homers on the 20th from the right side. He was named co-NL Player of the Week from August 20‚Äì26 by slugging .793 with three home runs and as expected, he was awarded NL Player of the Month for August. On September 22, Teixeira had his first walk-off hit with the Braves when he singled in Willie Harris giving the Braves a 4‚Äì3 extra-inning victory. In 54 games with Atlanta in 2007, Teixeira batted .317 with 17 home runs and 56 RBI. The Braves avoided arbitration in the 2007 offseason and signed Teixeira to a one-year, $12.5 million contract for the 2008 season. Teixeira playing for the Angels in 2008 American League Division Series Game 4 on October 6. =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim= On July 29, 2008, Teixeira was traded to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for Casey Kotchman and minor league pitcher Stephen Marek. Batting third in the Angel order, Teixeira hit .358 with 13 home runs and 43 RBIs after the trade to help his new team to their first 100-win season in franchise history. Through 2011, he was one of seven major leaguers to have had at least four 30-homer, 100-RBI seasons in their first five years, along with Chuck Klein, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Ralph Kiner, Albert Pujols, and Ryan Braun. Teixeira made his postseason debut with a .467 batting average, 7 hits and an RBI. His new team of the Angels would lose the 2008 ALDS to the Boston Red Sox in 4 games. Teixeira declared for free agency at the end of the season. =New York Yankees= Teixeira, pictured in 2009. 2009 In December 2008, Teixeira agreed preliminarily to a deal with the New York Yankees worth $180 million over 8 years, and he was formally introduced as a Yankee on January 6, 2009. The contract included a full no-trade clause, plus a $5 million signing bonus. He signed with the Yankees over a number of other clubs, including the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Boston Red Sox, Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles. The signing with the Yankees reunited Teixeira with teammate Alex Rodriguez who played for the Texas Rangers from 2001 to 2003. Teixeira wore the number 25 instead of his preferred number 23, since 23 is retired in honor of Don Mattingly. Mattingly was Teixeira's childhood idol, and was the reason Teixeira wore 23 earlier in his career. The signing became official on January 6, 2009. In the 2009 season, he led the AL in both home runs (tied with Carlos Pe√±a of Tampa Bay) with 39, and RBI with 122. Teixeira received a World Series ring as the Yankees won the 2009 World Series, but struggled offensively throughout the postseason, batting only .180 overall and .136 in the World Series. However, several of his hits proved very important, including a walk-off home run in Game 2 of the ALDS and a game- tying home run in Game 2 of the World Series. Additionally, he made several stellar defensive plays in all rounds of the playoffs. Teixeira in 2009 For the 2009 season, Teixeira was awarded both the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger awards for the American League first baseman. He also finished second in the AL MVP balloting behind Twins' catcher Joe Mauer. 2010 Teixeira on first base in 2011 On April 23, against the Angels, Teixeira was involved in a home-plate collision with Bobby Wilson while sliding home. Teixeira confessed that the collision was not intentional, and was not disciplined by the league for his action. On May 8, Teixeira became the second Yankees player to hit three home runs in one game against the Boston Red Sox, joining Lou Gehrig, who accomplished the feat on June 23, 1927. On June 20, against the New York Mets, Teixeira hit a grand slam off Johan Santana, proving to be the Yankees' only offense of the game in the 4‚Äì0 victory. Once again, Teixeira won the 2010 Gold Glove Award for American League first basemen. In 158 games of 2010, Teixeira finished with a .256 average, 33 home runs, and 108 runs batted in. He also led the American League with 113 runs scored. In the 2010 ALCS, Teixeira injured his hamstring, and did not play for the remainder of the playoffs. The Yankees lost the series to the Rangers in six games. 2011 On June 30, 2011, Teixeira hit his 300th career home run off Randy Wolf of the Milwaukee Brewers. On August 2, 2011, Teixeira hit a home run from both sides of the plate in the same game for the 12th time in his career, breaking a three-way tie with Chili Davis and Eddie Murray for the most such games all-time. In August 2011, Teixeira and Curtis Granderson became the first Yankees teammates to have 30 home runs in 115 games since Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle in 1961. Teixeira on August 28, 2011 Through 2011, he had the third-best career fielding percentage among major league first basemen (.996), behind Casey Kotchman and Kevin Youkilis. During the 2011 year, Teixeira batted .248 with 39 home runs and 111 RBI in 156 games. Teixeira continued his postseason struggles in 2011 as he batted only .167 with 1 RBI in a 5-game ALDS loss to the Detroit Tigers. 2012 Teixeira in 2012 On March 1, 2012, Teixeira hired Casey Close of Excel Sports Management to be his agent. This came almost a year after Teixeira parted ways with Boras. Close also represents fellow Yankees Derek Jeter and Masahiro Tanaka, as well as Ryan Howard. Throughout the 2012 season, Teixeira was plagued with several health issues and injuries such as a \\"persistent and almost debilitating\\" cough caused by severe congestion of the bronchi, wrist inflammation, and a calf strain. Teixeira spent some time on the disabled list with the calf strain from late August until early September. After committing a disputed double play in a 4‚Äì5 loss against the Orioles, Teixeira aggravated his calf and was put on the DL again. He would eventually return for the season finale against the Red Sox. He finished the 2012 season with a .251 batting average, 24 home runs, and 84 RBI in 123 games played. The Yankees would again make the playoffs, but loss to the Tigers in a 4-game sweep of the 2012 ALCS. Following the season, Teixeira won the 2012 Gold Glove Award for American League first basemen. He won a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding first baseman in MLB. He named the Yankees' nominee for the 2012 Roberto Clemente Award. 2013 On March 6, 2013, Teixeira suffered a strained wrist tendon while he was part of Team USA of the World Baseball Classic. Teixeira began the 2013 season on the 15-day disabled list, and was transferred to the 60-day disabled list on May 14. He returned on May 31, 2013, against the Red Sox going 0‚àí3 with a walk and scoring a run. He aggravated the wrist on June 15, 2013, and the next day, he received cortisone injections to treat the inflammation of the wrist. He was again placed on the 15-day DL due to the inflammation on June 18, 2013. Teixeira played in only 15 games during the 2013 season with a .151 average, 3 home runs, and 12 RBI. On July 1, 2013, Teixeira underwent wrist surgery and was shut down for the rest of the season. 2014 During a game against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 4, 2014, Teixeira left the game after a hamstring injury while trying to fetch a foul ball in foul territory. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list the following day on April 5, 2014. He was activated on April 20, 2014. During a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 17, 2014, Teixeira hit his 350th career home run off of Edinson V√≥lquez. On May 31, 2014, Teixeira aggravated his wrist that was surgically repaired the previous year. He received a cortisone shot to treat the wrist and missed two games. During a game against the Orioles on June 22, 2014, Teixeira left the game after being hit in the toe of the left foot by a pitch from T. J. McFarland. X-rays came back negative on the toe injury. On September 4, 2014, Teixeira hit his 21st home run of the season, which was a game-tying, solo home run that paved the way for a walk-off 5‚Äì4 victory over the Red Sox. In 2014, Teixeira batted only .216, but still hit 22 home runs with 62 RBI limited to 123 games. 2015 Teixeira experienced a resurgent season in 2015, being named to his third All-Star team, hitting the most home runs in a season since 2011. During a game against the Minnesota Twins on August 17, 2015, Teixeira fouled a ball off his leg and left the game. X-Rays were negative, but it was projected that he had a deep bone bruise in his leg. Listed as day-to-day, Teixeira missed nearly two weeks and was sent back to New York on August 31, 2015 to visit Yankees head team physician, Dr. Christopher Ahmad to seek second opinions. On September 1, Teixeira underwent CAT scans, x-rays, and MRIs, all testing negative. On September 4, Teixeira was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to the nagging bone bruise. On September 11, Teixeira underwent further tests and an MRI revealed a fracture in his shin, which eventually ended his 2015 season. The injury required three months to recover. In 111 games of 2015, Teixeira batted .255 with 31 home runs and 79 RBI. 2016 Teixeira struggled to open the season. On May 10, 2016, Teixeira revealed that he had been battling neck spasms. On May 25, he underwent an MRI on his neck, which was negative. The next day, he received a cortisone shot to treat the pain in his neck. In a game against the Orioles on June 3, he left the game due to right knee discomfort. He underwent an MRI the next day, which revealed that there was torn articular cartilage, placing him on the 15-day disabled list. Hoping to avoid surgery, Teixeira opted for treatment and rehabilitation on June 8. He was activated on June 25. While playing the San Diego Padres on July 3, Teixeira hit two home runs, including his 400th career home run. He became only the fifth switch-hitter to hit 400 home runs in a career. He followed teammate and fellow switch-hitter Carlos Beltr√°n, who had also hit his 400th career home run for the Yankees less than two months earlier on May 15. Another former teammate who also accomplished this feat was Chipper Jones, with whom Teixeira briefly played as a member of the Atlanta Braves. On August 5, Teixeira held a press conference in which he announced his intent to retire at the end of the season, citing his family life and the year's injuries. On September 28, Teixeira hit the final home run of his career, which was a walk-off grand slam off Boston Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly. It was the first game-ending home run Teixeira had ever hit in a regular- season game. As of July 2019, it is also the only walk-off grand slam hit at the new Yankee Stadium. On September 30, prior to a game against the Orioles, Teixeira was honored by the rock band, Twisted Sister during a pregame ceremony. The band gifted Teixeira an Epiphone Les Paul guitar with signatures from everyone in the band. The song, \\"I Wanna Rock\\" was used as Teixeira's walk-up song since he first joined the Yankees. October 2 was Teixeira's final game of his career. Prior to the game, another pregame ceremony took place with his wife and three children visiting. He received several gifts, including a framed jersey and an autographed base. He finished the game 0 for 3 and left the game in the 7th inning as the Yankees lost 5‚Äì2 to the Orioles. In 116 games of his final season in the majors, Teixeira batted .204 with 15 home runs and 44 RBI.

Personal life CC Sabathia and Mark Teixeira (right) during the 2009 World Series parade. After signing his first major league contract, Teixeira set up a scholarship at his high school in honor of a friend who was killed in a car accident. Teixeira and his family reside in Greenwich, Connecticut. In 2006, Teixeira and his wife Leigh Williams, whom he met at Georgia Tech, established the Mark Teixeira Charitable Fund that supported six scholarships at three high schools in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth area. They have three children, sons Jack Gordan and William Charles, and daughter Addison Leigh. Teixeira's mother Margaret died on December 2, 2015.

Name An M√°m is Irish for \\"the pass\\" and as this is a Gaeltacht (principally Irish-speaking) area, formally exists only in Irish - the anglicised form has no official standing, though it is in use for centuries too. Location and access The village is located at the southern end of the Maam Valley, where it comes to Lough Corrib; the other end lies at Leenaun on Killary Harbour. The settlement lies at an altitude of around 20 metres, between where the main river of the southern two thirds of the valley, Joyce's River, is captured by the larger Abhainn Beal Atha na mBreac (Bealnabrack River) and where the Failmore River joins that river's mouth at the northern end of the lake. It sits at the edge of a mountainous area, the principal part of which forms the Maumturk or Maamturk Mountains. An M√°m lies north of Maam Cross, an important crossroads from which the main road serving the settlement, and providing a secondary route through the Maam Valley to Leenaun, the R336, comes, splitting off from the R59 Galway to Clifden road. Maam Bridge, built in 1823, takes the R336 across the Bealnabrack River. History This area formed part of the wider Joyce Country, named for a key family grouping, originally from Wales, which dominated the region for centuries. Features Historically there was a castle in the area, and from the 19th century, a small courthouse (closed in 2004) and a post office. Alexander Nimmo built an inn in 1820 at the eastern end of Maam Bridge, and this later became the Maum Hotel, owned by the family of Lord Leitrim for many years; it now operates as Keane's Pub. The area has several B&B; establishments, and there is a hotel at Maam Cross. Many community facilities are provided from Leenaun. There is free fishing in the river and the nearer parts of the lake, and a jetty was built by Maam Bridge to facilitate angling access.

It has two linearly independent solutions, called the periods of elliptic functions. The ratio of the two periods is equal to the period ratio œÑ, the standard coordinate on the upper-half plane. However, the ratio of two solutions of the hypergeometric equation is also known as a Schwarz triangle map. The Picard‚ÄìFuchs equation can be cast into the form of Riemann's differential equation, and thus solutions can be directly read off in terms of Riemann P-functions. One has :y(j)=P \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} 0 & 1 & \\\\infty & \\\\;  {1/6} & {1/4} & 0 & j  {-1/6\\\\;} & {3/4} & 0 & \\\\; \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\, At least four methods to find the j-function inverse can be given. Dedekind defines the j-function by its Schwarz derivative in his letter to Borchardt. As a partial fraction, it reveals the geometry of the fundamental domain: :2S\\\\tau(j) = \\\\frac{1-\\\\frac{1}{4}}{(1-j)^2} + \\\\frac{1-\\\\frac{1}{9}}{j^2} + \\\\frac{1-\\\\frac{1}{4}-\\\\frac{1}{9}}{j(1-j)} = \\\\frac{3}{4(1-j)^2} + \\\\frac{8}{9j^2} + \\\\frac{23}{36j(1-j)} where (S∆í)(x) is the Schwarzian derivative of ∆í with respect to x. Generalization In algebraic geometry, this equation has been shown to be a very special case of a general phenomenon, the Gauss-Manin connection. References =Pedagogical= * * J. Harnad and J.

It pitted forces of the Holy League against France and their Ferrarese allies. Although the French and Ferrarese decimated the Papal-Spanish forces, their extraordinary triumph was overshadowed by the loss of their brilliant young general Gaston of Foix. The victory therefore did not help them secure northern Italy. The French withdrew entirely from Italy in the summer of 1512, as Swiss mercenaries hired by Pope Julius II and Imperial troops under Emperor Maximilian I arrived in Lombardy. The Sforza was restored to power in Milan. Monster of Ravenna A month before the battle, multiple sources reported a monstrous birth which became known as the Monster of Ravenna. This child's terrifying features included a horn on its forehead, wings, an eye on its knee, and a clawed foot, according to Florentine chronicler Luca Landucci.Niccoli, Prophecy and People in Renaissance Italy, 36. Its appearance was a cause for alarm, and news spread across Europe in the diaries of contemporary writers. Most accounts, including that of Landucci's, associate the \\"monster's\\" appearance with the battle it preceded; its appearance was taken for a bad omen of future suffering, and the French medical professional Ambroise Par√© opined that the creature's birth was a direct sign of God's wrath, brought to bear in the form of Louis XII's army.Daston and Park, Wonders and the Order of Nature, 177; Par√©, On Monsters and Marvels, 6. Regardless, the Monster of Ravenna acquired theological implications which evolved beyond the one battle and persisted well into the Protestant Reformation. Prelude Beginning in February 1512, the French forces in Italy, newly commanded by Gaston de Foix, Duc de Nemours, had been engaged in capturing cities in the Romagna and the Veneto, in an attempt to deny control of those regions to the forces of the Holy League. Although he had been successful in a number of sieges, Nemours was aware that the impending invasion of France by Henry VIII of England would cause much of his army to be withdrawn, and he was determined to force the main army of the Holy League into battle before that occurred. Thus, in late March, Nemours, together with an Italian contingent under Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, marched east from Bologna and laid siege to the city of Ravenna, which was defended by Papal troops. Julius II, alarmed at the prospect of losing his last stronghold in the Romagna, demanded that an army be sent to relieve the city; Ram√≥n de Cardona had to comply, and the Spanish army set out for Ravenna with a company of Papal troops in tow. By 9 April, they had passed Forl√¨, and were advancing north along the Ronco River towards the city, and on the next day had reached Molinaccio, only a mile south of the French positions, but still separated from them by the Ronco. Nemours, short on supplies and increasingly anxious to give battle before he was forced to withdraw from Italy, ordered a general attack for the following day. Battle =Dispositions= The Two Armies at the Battle of Ravenna (1530 woodcut) The strengths, relative positions, and commanders of the component elements of both armies are unclear, and different arrangements are given by historians.Arnold, Renaissance at War, 166; Oman, Art of War, 134‚Äì138, 143; Taylor, Art of War, 182‚Äì185, 206‚Äì207. Taylor relies primarily on the accounts by Guicciardini and Pandolfini for the positions of the units, and on the account by Sanuto for the numbers; he notes that Sanuto apparently records the official strength of each army, rather than the number of men actually present. Oman also notes that he follows Sanuto's numbers, as he considers them \\"more trustworthy than later details and figures given by Guicciardini and others\\" (Oman, Art of War, 134). The French army formed up in an arc to the east of Cardona's fortified camp; closest to the river were about 900 men- at-arms of the \\"vaward\\", under Jacques de La Palice and Alfonso d'Este.Arnold, Renaissance at War, 166; Oman, Art of War, 134‚Äì135, 143; Taylor, Art of War, 182. Taylor gives the number of men in the vaward as 910. Next to this cavalry was the bulk of the infantry. According to Charles Oman, it consisted of three separate units: 3,500 Gascon crossbowmen, 5,000 landsknechts under Jacob Empser, and 3,000 Picards and Gascons under Thomas Bohier, the Seneschal of Normandy.Oman, Art of War, 134‚Äì135, 143. Oman notes that the second group of French infantry was part of the \\"main-battle\\" rather than the \\"vaward\\". Arnold gives the identical positioning of units, but does not mention their numbers or commanders (Arnold, Renaissance at War, 166). Frederick Taylor groups the infantry into only two units: 9,500 landsknechts under Empser and 8,000 \\"Gascon archers and Picard pikemen\\" under the Seigneur de Molart.Taylor, Art of War, 183. The men-at-arms of the \\"main-battle\\", consisting of 780 men, was commanded by either Bohier alone, or by Bohier together with the Vicomte de Lautrec, Louis d'Ars, and the Chevalier de Bayard.Oman, Art of War, 134; Taylor, Art of War, 182‚Äì183. Taylor names only Bohier as the commander, while Oman lists him together with the others. This cavalry occupied one of two positions: according to Oman and Thomas Arnold, it was placed in the arc to the left of the French infantry, while Taylor has it behind the cavalry of the \\"vaward\\", next to the river.Arnold, Renaissance at War, 166; Oman, Art of War, 134‚Äì136, 143; Taylor, Art of War, 182‚Äì183, 207. Taylor notes that he follows Guicciardini's account in placing the cavalry behind the main line. Oman acknowledges this point by Guicciardini, but considers it \\"difficult to reconcile with the details of some of the later fighting given by other writers\\"; he believes that \\"it would seem more likely that they were in the true centre of the array\\" (Oman, Art of War, 135‚Äì136). Farther to the left of the French line‚Äîbeyond the cavalry of the \\"main-battle\\", according to Arnold and Oman, or directly flanking the infantry, according to Taylor‚Äîwas the \\"rearward\\" corps of the army, commanded by Yves d'Al√©gre.Arnold, Renaissance at War, 166; Oman, Art of War, 134‚Äì136, 143; Taylor, Art of War, 183. It consisted of about 4,000 mostly Italian infantry under Frederigo de Bozzolo, flanked, on the extreme left, by about 2,000 light cavalry under Gian Bernardo Caracciolo.Oman, Art of War, 134‚Äì136, 143; Taylor, Art of War, 183. According to Oman, the light cavalry included 300 Ferarrese mounted arquebusiers, as well as French mounted crossbowmen and stradioti. Taylor also mentions the presence of about 1,000 dismounted archers with the light cavalry; Oman includes a further 300 men-at-arms under d'Al√©gre. The arrangement of the Holy League army is similarly a matter of dispute; Oman comments that \\"the array of Cardona's army, though elaborately described by more than one narrator, is not very easy to make out.\\"Oman, Art of War, 137. At the north end of the camp, near the river, was the cavalry of the \\"vaward\\", consisting of about 670 Papal men-at-arms under Fabrizio Colonna.Arnold, Renaissance at War, 166; Oman, Art of War, 137, 143; Taylor, Art of War, 184. The Papal cavalry was positioned close to the gap in the entrenchments near the riverbank. Farther along the river were two more bodies of men-at-arms: the \\"main-battle\\", consisting of 565 men under the Marquis of La Palude, and the rearguard, consisting of 490 men under Alfonso Carvajal.Arnold, Renaissance at War, 166; Oman, Art of War, 137‚Äì138, 143; Taylor, Art of War, 184. Taylor divides the Holy League infantry into four blocks: three divisions of Spanish infantry, each consisting of four colunellas of 500‚Äì600 men each, and one formation of Papal infantry, numbering about 2,000, all under the general command of Pedro Navarro; Taylor places the formations of infantry in a deep column parallel to the river, on the far side of the cavalry, and perpendicular to the entrenchments.Taylor, Art of War, 184. The Papal infantry is the third formation in the column, between the last two Spanish divisions. According to Taylor, Carvajal's cavalry was farther back than the last of these. Oman and Arnold place the infantry in three lines running along the length of the entrenchments; no number is given for the first of these, but the second is given as consisting of 4,000 men, and the third, placed as a reserve, as including \\"three Spanish foot regiments\\" as well as the 2,000 Papal infantry.Arnold, Renaissance at War, 166; Oman, Art of War, 137‚Äì138, 143. Oman notes that Guicciardini records the strength of the Papal infantry as 4,000, but considers it to be \\"probably an exaggeration\\". He gives several possibile names for the commander of the Papal troops: he was \\"a captain called Ramassot\\" according to Fabrizio Colonna and Bayard, \\"Cornelio Romaeo of Bologna\\" according to K√∂chlein, and \\"Hernan Magote\\" according to Spanish sources; Oman comments that \\"he is otherwise unknown\\" (Oman, Art of War, 138). Beyond the infantry‚Äîto the far side of it from the river, according to Taylor, or at the end of its line, according to Oman and Arnold‚Äîwas the light cavalry, consisting of 1,500‚Äì1,700 Spanish ginetes and Italian mounted arquebusiers under the command of Fernando d'Avalos, Marquis of Pescara.Arnold, Renaissance at War, 166; Oman, Art of War, 137, 143; Taylor, Art of War, 184. Taylor gives the lower bound for the strength of the light cavalry, while Oman gives the higher. In his section on war wagons Arnold avers that the Spanish \\"had at least thirty carts mounting scythe blades, forward-projecting spears and organ guns.Arnold, The Renaissance at War, p. 82. =Artillery exchange= The advancing French troops halted about two hundred paces from the enemy lines.Taylor, Art of War, 188. The sporadic exchange of artillery fire that had been taking place since the French had begun to cross the Ronco now developed into a full-scale artillery duel between the two armies that lasted more than two hours.Black, European Warfare, 73‚Äì74; Hall, Weapons and Warfare, 172; Oman, Art of War, 138; Taylor, Art of War, 187‚Äì188. Taylor gives a number of figures from contemporary sources for the length of the cannonade; according to Fabrizio Colonna, Jacopo Guicciardini, Francesco Guicciardini, Coccinius, and the R√©lacion, it lasted two hours, while Pandolfini and Floranges record it as lasting three. Black notes the cannonade's \\"unprecedented length\\" (Black, European Warfare, 74). A new tactic, the open-field exchange of artillery fire was \\"the most violent cannonade between armies in the field that the world had yet seen\\", according to Taylor, and \\"the first of its kind in the historical record\\", according to Bert Hall.Hall, Weapons and Warfare, 172; Oman, Art of War, 138; Taylor, Art of War, 188. De Foix placed the bulk of his artillery in front of the French right wing, directing its fire into the Holy League's camp.Oman, Art of War, 138. Navarro ordered his infantry to take cover‚Äîthe troops hid in the trenches, or lay prone on the slopes of the river embankments‚Äîbut Colonna's men-at-arms had no shelter available, and began to take heavy casualties from the cannon fire.Arnold, Renaissance at War, 167; Hall, Weapons and Warfare, 172; Oman, Art of War, 138; Taylor, Art of War, 188‚Äì189. The Spanish artillery, meanwhile, ignored the French cavalry and concentrated its fire on the massed Gascons and landsknechts in the French center.Hall, Weapons and Warfare, 172; Oman, Art of War, 139; Taylor, Art of War, 189. The Spanish fire was, according to Oman, \\"excessively murderous\\", and casualties among the French infantry were substantial; as many as 2,000 men were killed, and the Gascons were so shaken by the fire that the landsknechts were forced to push them back with pikes in order to keep them in line.Oman, Art of War, 139; Taylor, Art of War, 189. Oman cites the accounts by Coccinius, Bayard, and Floranges for depictions of the casualties; he notes, however, that Coccinius is \\"rather propagandistic in praising the steadiness of his compatriots, and depreciating that of the French\\" (Oman, Art of War, 139). According to Oman, Coccinius and Bayard relate that Philip of Freiberg, the landsknechts' second- in-command, and a Gascon captain named De Molard, were \\"cut in two by the same cannonball, as they were talking together between their lines\\" (Oman, Art of War, 139). Hall merely notes that the French center was \\"pounded mercilessly\\" (Hall, Weapons and Warfare, 172). Not content with bombarding the camp from one side, the French moved to enfilade it from the flanks.Taylor, Art of War, 189. The Duke of Ferrara, who had apparently been acting independently of the main army since the crossing of the Ronco, had moved twenty-four of his cannon around the rear of the French position, finally bringing them up on the left flank, facing Pescara's light cavalry.Arnold, Renaissance at War, 167; Oman, Art of War, 138‚Äì139; Taylor, Art of War, 209‚Äì210. The route taken by d'Este is unclear. Taylor notes that some contemporary accounts, including Pandolfini and Castello, make mention of guns that were moved from the French right to the French center, and that Guicciardini assumes that it was the Duke of Ferrara who was responsible for the move. Taylor, however, believes that Giovio's account, which has d'Este maneuvering independently from the beginning, is more accurate, since his heavy cannon could not be moved across the broken terrain immediately behind the French position. Oman echoes this argument; he writes that, as \\"no 'point-to-point' movement was possible\\", d'Este could not have been initially involved with the cannonade on the French right, and must have moved directly to his final position after crossing the river (Oman, Art of War, 138‚Äì139). From this position, d'Este's guns inflicted heavy casualties on Pescara and Carvajal's cavalry; so intense was the fire that some of it overshot the camp, inflicting casualties on the French troops on the other side.Oman, Art of War, 138‚Äì139; Taylor, Art of War, 190. Taylor cites Giovio for the account of d'Este causing casualties on his own side; he notes it as indicating that the Ferrarese guns were able to enfilade the entire length of the Spanish camp. Yves d'Al√®gre, meanwhile, had devised a similar plan on the other flank; re-crossing the Ronco with two heavy guns, he positioned them across the river from the Spanish camp‚Äîdirectly to the rear of Colonna's position.Arnold, Renaissance at War, 167; Hall, Weapons and Warfare, 172; Oman, Art of War, 139‚Äì140; Taylor, Art of War, 189‚Äì190, 208. Arnold has d'Al√®gre move the guns later in the battle, after the cavalry engagement had begun; Hall attributes the move to the Duke of Ferrara instead of d'Al√®gre. The fire of these two guns inflicted massive casualties on Colonna's closely packed cavalry.Oman, Art of War, 139‚Äì140. Oman notes that Colonna, after his capture, related that he had seen a single cannonball kill thirty-three of his men-at-arms. =Cavalry fight= Pressed from both sides by the fire of the French and Ferrarese artillery, the Holy League's cavalry could not hold their positions indefinitely.Oman, Art of War, 140; Taylor, Art of War, 190‚Äì191. Oman writes that the artillery fire exerted an \\"intolerable pressure\\" on the cavalry, and that Colona \\"made up his mind that he would have to charge at all costs\\" (Oman, Art of War, 140). The first to move were the heavy cavalry of the rearguard under Carvajal, riding out from the entrenchments towards the Ferrarese guns on the French left; according to Taylor, Carvajal's advance was disorderly and possibly spontaneous.Oman, Art of War, 140; Taylor, Art of War, 191, 211‚Äì213. Taylor, citing the Relacion, writes that Carvajal's movement was \\"dictated by panic, and undertaken perhaps without the viceroy's permission\\" (Taylor, Art of War, 191). Black also notes that the cavalry advance was \\"unplanned\\" (Black, European Warfare, 74). Carvajal was quickly joined by Pescara's light cavalry and by the Marquis of La Palude, both having been sent forward by Cardona; together, these bodies of cavalry advanced on the French line, Palude moving directly forwards while Pescara attempted a flanking movement.Oman, Art of War, 140; Taylor, Art of War, 191, 211‚Äì213. According to Oman, Pescara followed Carvajal immediately, while La Palude was sent out later, and \\"had difficulty in joining the rest\\" (Oman, Art of War, 140). Taylor, meanwhile, writes that Pescara and La Palude both followed Carvajal \\"on instructions from the viceroy\\" (Taylor, Art of War, 191). The target of the cavalry attack is inconsistently named among contemporary sources; both Oman and Taylor agree that it must have been the heavy cavalry of the French \\"main-battle\\", commanded by Foix, Lautrec, and the Seneschal of Normandy, which had apparently moved towards the French left.Oman, Art of War, 140; Taylor, Art of War, 191, 211‚Äì213. Taylor presents a lengthy analysis of the contemporary chroniclers and their differing accounts of the Spanish charge; he cites Bayard, Pandolfini, and Vignati as indicating that the Spanish target was the main body of French heavy cavalry (Taylor, Art of War, 211). Carvajal, Pescara, and Palude converged on the French cavalry, which split into two bodies and met both Spanish attacks head-on.Taylor, Art of War, 191‚Äì192, 211‚Äì213. The initial Spanish charges were unsuccessful in breaking the French line; Taylor attributes their failure to the depleted morale of the Spanish cavalry after the artillery bombardment, the effect of \\"ditches and vegetation\\" on the Spanish formations, the better tactics of the French, and the arrival of reinforcements sent by La Palice from the French vanguard.Taylor, Art of War, 191‚Äì192, 211‚Äì213. Taylor notes that because of the broken ground, Palude was \\"able to muster only one-third of his men for the vital shock\\" (Taylor, Art of War, 192). The bodies of French and Spanish cavalry then engaged in a lengthy fight along the left of the French positions.Oman, Art of War, 140. Oman writes that \\"the Spanish horse are given by all authorities a fine testimonial for their repeated charges\\" (Oman, Art of War, 140). Meanwhile, Fabrizio Colonna, having seen the other Spanish cavalry engaged, rode out between the Ronco and the Spanish trenches and charged the French line; his target is similarly the subject of disagreement among contemporary sources, but Oman and Taylor agree that he must have attacked the portion of the French vanguard under La Palice which the latter had not sent to assist Foix in the center.Oman, Art of War, 140‚Äì141; Taylor, Art of War, 192‚Äì193, 211‚Äì213. According to Oman, Bayard claims that Colonna attacked the French \\"main-battle\\"; but Oman notes that this is inconsistent with Colonna's claim that he did not attack until the other Spanish formations were engaged. He cites Pandolfini as the only chronicler who \\"says definitely that Colonna fought La Palice, which seems to have been the fact\\" (Oman, Art of War, 141). Taylor writes that Colonna had suggested that Navarro attack as well, but that the latter, having \\"opposed the decision to launch the cavalry\\", demurred (Taylor, Art of War, 193). He also notes the inconsistency between the accounts of Pandolfini and Bayard. As Colonna and La Palice fought along the French right, d'Al√®gre, who had earlier been summoned by La Palice, arrived with 400 fresh heavy cavalry, as well as the infantry of the French reserve.Oman, Art of War, 141; Taylor, Art of War, 193, 212‚Äì213. Colonna's formation, pressed from multiple directions, began to disintegrate, with some of his men-at-arms fleeing the field and others retreating south to where the other Spanish cavalry was engaged.Oman, Art of War, 141; Taylor, Art of War, 193, 212‚Äì213. Taylor writes that \\"Fabrizio soon found that his command had all but disappeared\\" (Taylor, Art of War, 193). D'Al√®gre followed the retreating Spanish troops to the center, where the remnants of the Spanish cavalry were engaged in a desperate melee against the French.Oman, Art of War, 141; Taylor, Art of War, 194, 212‚Äì213. Taylor writes that \\"for half-an-hour all that survived of the Spanish cavalry supported a bitter hand-to-hand struggle with the bulk of the French gendarmerie\\" (Taylor, Art of War, 194). Finally, when a part of the French vanguard joined the fight as well, the Spanish cavalry broke; Pescara and La Palude were taken prisoner, Colonna retreated back into the Spanish entrenchments, and Carvajal and Cardona fled south-west towards Cesena.Oman, Art of War, 141‚Äì142; Taylor, Art of War, 194, 212‚Äì213. Oman writes that \\"Ramon of Cardona‚Äîmuch to Colonna's disgust‚Äîleft the field with the broken squadrons, while Pedro Navarro and the infantry were still making a gallant bid for victory\\" (Oman, Art of War, 142). A large part of the French cavalry pursued the retreating Spanish, while the others turned to take part in the infantry fight which had unfolded in the meantime.Oman, Art of War, 142; Taylor, Art of War, 194. =Infantry fight= As the Spanish cavalry was making its initial attack, Foix had sent orders for the French infantry to advance on the Holy League's camp.Oman, Art of War, 142; Taylor, Art of War, 195. Oman notes that the infantry had been \\"waiting for orders under a devastating fire\\" (Oman, Art of War, 142). A mixed group of 2,000 Gascon crossbowmen and 1,000 Picard pikemen, gathered from Molart's and Bozollo's troops, advanced towards the camp; according to Taylor, they moved along a path between the embankment and the river, and were shielded from view by the former.Oman, Art of War, 142; Taylor, Art of War, 195. Oman makes no mention of the path by which the Gascons advanced, and states only that they were ordered to \\"press on towards the Spanish line\\" (Oman, Art of War, 142). The Gascons advanced to the edge of the Spanish entrenchments and began to fire onto the Spanish infantry; according to Oman, they were immediately driven back by \\"a blistering fire of arquebuses and swivel guns\\", while Taylor writes that Navarro moved the Papal infantry forward to engage them.Oman, Art of War, 142; Taylor, Art of War, 195‚Äì196. Oman notes that the \\"swivel guns\\" may have been those mounted on Navarro's carts. He does not mention the engagement of the Papal infantry until later in the battle. The main column of landsknechts had meanwhile made its way to the edge of the Spanish entrenchments, and begun to force its way into the fortified camp.Oman, Art of War, 142‚Äì143; Taylor, Art of War, 195‚Äì197. Jacob Empser and his lieutenant Fabian von Schlabendorf were both killed in the initial push, but parts of the German column finally crossed the ditch and engaged the waiting Spanish infantry hand-to-hand.Oman, Art of War, 143‚Äì144; Taylor, Art of War, 196‚Äì197. Oman writes that Schlabendorf was killed as he \\"made a gap in the line of Spanish pikes by taking his own pike by the butt and using it like a flail\\" (Oman, Art of War, 143). The Spanish swordsmen inflicted massive casualties among the landsknechts‚Äîwho were unable to defend themselves with long pikes at such close quarters‚Äîand the German column recoiled back across the trenches, having suffered more than a thousand casualties.Oman, Art of War, 144; Taylor, Art of War, 197. Taylor writes that the swordsmen caused \\"terrible carnage\\" in the German formation (Taylor, Art of War, 197). The landsknechts and the Gascons proceeded to attack once more, with even greater casualties.Oman, Art of War, 144. Oman writes that \\"nine of the twelve German landsknecht captains were killed or wounded\\" (Oman, Art of War, 144). Fabrizio Colonna, who had by this time returned to the camp with the remnants of his cavalry, charged into the flank of the attacking infantry; he would write that \\"with 200 lances he could have retrieved the fortune of the day\\".Oman, Art of War, 144; Taylor, Art of War, 197. Oman notes that Colonna's view was \\"optimistic\\" (Oman, Art of War, 144). Two companies of Spanish infantry attacked the Gascons engaged on the riverbank, breaking their formation, killing Molart, and pursuing them back towards the French artillery positions.Oman, Art of War, 144; Taylor, Art of War, 196‚Äì197. Taylor cites Floranges, the Loyal Serviteur, Pandolfini, Guicciardini, and Peter Martyr as sources for the rout of the Gascons. He notes that the Spanish charge must have taken place after the end of the cavalry engagement, since Al√®gre was present and was killed trying to rally the French infantry. The remaining infantry on both sides continued meanwhile to struggle across the entrenchments.Oman, Art of War, 144‚Äì145. =Endgame= The Death of Gaston de Foix in the Battle of Ravenna on 11 April 1512 (oil on canvas by Ary Scheffer, c. 1824) At this juncture, the French cavalry‚Äîboth those that had returned from the pursuit of Cardona and those that had remained on the field‚Äîdescended on the Spanish infantry from all sides.Oman, Art of War, 145; Taylor, Art of War, 198. Oman and Taylor both note that the French cavalry entered the camp both through the gap between the river and the entrenchments, and by jumping over the ditch itself. Taylor mentions that the Duke of Ferrara \\"left his guns... and joined the general assault\\" (Taylor, Art of War, 198). Together with the German and Gascon infantry, which had reformed and now renewed its attacks, the French cavalry overwhelmed the Spanish formations, inflicting terrible casualties; Colonna and Navarro were both wounded and captured as they tried to rally the defenders.Oman, Art of War, 145; Taylor, Art of War, 198‚Äì199. Oman mentions that Colonna attempted to bring up Ramassot's infantry, which Taylor lists as already having been committed. A few thousand of the Spanish infantry managed to escape, fleeing towards Cesena and Forl√¨; the others were \\"ridden over and trampled down\\", according to Oman.Oman, Art of War, 145; Taylor, Art of War, 198‚Äì199. The two Spanish companies which had earlier routed the Gascons, having found their path north barred by the French rearguard under the Bastard du Fay, had meanwhile retraced their path along the river back towards the camp.Oman, Art of War, 145; Taylor, Art of War, 196. Marching south along the embankment, they were attacked by Gaston de Foix and his personal staff, numbering about fifteen; in the ensuing melee, the French knights were scattered, Foix was killed, and the Spanish proceeded to withdraw from the field.Oman, Art of War, 146; Taylor, Art of War, 199, 214‚Äì215. Taylor comments that there is some confusion in contemporary accounts about where and how Foix met his death; he follows the account of the Loyal Serviteur in placing his death at the hands of the retreating Spanish companies. A few miles from the battlefield, the Spanish infantry encountered Bayard, returning from his pursuit of Cardona; lacking the numbers to break them, Bayard let them pass, not knowing that they had just killed his commander.Oman, Art of War, 146‚Äì147. Oman cites passages from the Loyal Serviteur for this episode. Aftermath Gaston de Foix, commander of the French army, killed at Ravenna The death of Gaston de Foix was a huge blow to the French, and his men were very sad to hear of his death. The young, talented general had a very high command level and had masterminded a remarkable string of victories in Italy. He was inspiring and faithful to his men. The Italian Wars might have taken a very different course had he survived the battle. Following the death of Gaston de Foix, command of the French army fell to La Palice, who had little interest in pursuing the retreating Spanish forces, preferring instead to return to the siege of Ravenna. The city soon fell, and the French proceeded to thoroughly sack it. However, much of the French army was withdrawn to France following the battle, and La Palice was forced to extricate himself from Italy in August by renewed efforts on the part of the Holy League. The Spanish forces in Italy were almost entirely destroyed at Ravenna, but Cardona would raise another army and appear in Lombardy in 1513. In the meantime, both Navarro and Colonna would see combat, Colonna in command of an Italian army and Navarro in the service of Francis I of France. Notes  Bibliography  * Arnold, Thomas F.

Sabah, Malaysia Framing, in construction, is the fitting together of pieces to give a structure support and shape.Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD- ROM (v. 4.0) ¬© Oxford University Press 2009. Frame, Framing, Framer, Framework, Frame-house. Framing materials are usually wood, engineered wood, or structural steel. The alternative to framed construction is generally called mass wall construction, where horizontal layers of stacked materials such as log building, masonry, rammed earth, adobe, etc. are used without framing. Building framing is divided into two broad categories,Townsend, Gilbert. Carpentry and joinery: a practical treatise on simple building construction, including framing, roof construction, general carpentry work, and exterior and interior finish of buildings. Chicago: American Technical Society, 1913. Print. 17. heavy-frame construction (heavy framing) if the vertical supports are few and heavy such as in timber framing, pole building framing, or steel framing; or light-frame construction (light-framing) if the supports are more numerous and smaller, such as balloon, platform, or light- steel framing. Light-frame construction using standardized dimensional lumber has become the dominant construction method in North America and Australia due to the economy of the method; use of minimal structural material allows builders to enclose a large area at minimal cost while achieving a wide variety of architectural styles. Modern light-frame structures usually gain strength from rigid panels (plywood and other plywood-like composites such as oriented strand board (OSB) used to form all or part of wall sections), but until recently carpenters employed various forms of diagonal bracing to stabilize walls. Diagonal bracing remains a vital interior part of many roof systems, and in-wall wind braces are required by building codes in many municipalities or by individual state laws in the United States. Special framed shear walls are becoming more common to help buildings meet the requirements of earthquake engineering and wind engineering.  History  Historically, people fitted naturally shaped wooden poles together as framework and then began using joints to connect the timbers, a method today called traditional timber framing' or log framing. In the United States, timber framing was superseded by balloon framing beginning in the 1830s. Balloon framing makes use of many lightweight wall members called studs rather than fewer, heavier supports called posts; balloon framing components are nailed together rather than fitted using joinery. The studs in a balloon frame extend two stories from sill to plate. Platform framing superseded balloon framing and is the standard wooden framing method today. The name comes from each floor level being framed as a separate unit or platform. Framed construction was rarely used in Scandinavia before the 20th century because of the abundant availability of wood, an abundance of cheap labour, and the superiority of the thermal insulation of logs; hence timber framing did not take off there first for unheated buildings such as farm buildings, outbuildings and summer villas, and for houses until the development of wall insulation.Harri Hautaj√§rvi, \\"Houses in Finland\\", Helsinki: Rakennustieto, 2011.  Walls  Wall framing in house construction includes the vertical and horizontal members of exterior walls and interior partitions, both of bearing walls and non-bearing walls. These stick members, referred to as studs, wall plates and lintels (sometimes called headers), serve as a nailing base for all covering material and support the upper floor platforms, which provide the lateral strength along a wall. The platforms may be the boxed structure of a ceiling and roof, or the ceiling and floor joists of the story above. In the building trades, the technique is variously referred to as stick and frame, stick and platform, or stick and box, as the sticks (studs) give the structure its vertical support, and the box-shaped floor sections with joists contained within length-long post and lintels (more commonly called headers), support the weight of whatever is above, including the next wall up and the roof above the top story. The platform also provides lateral support against wind and holds the stick walls true and square. Any lower platform supports the weight of the platforms and walls above the level of its component headers and joists. Framing lumber is subject to regulated standards that require a grade- stamp, and a moisture content not exceeding 19%. Alt URL There are three historically common methods of framing a house. * Post and beam, which is now used predominantly in barn construction. * Balloon framing using a technique suspending floors from the walls was common until the late 1940s, but since that time, platform framing has become the predominant form of house construction. * Platform framing often forms wall sections horizontally on the sub-floor prior to erection, easing positioning of studs and increasing accuracy while cutting the necessary manpower. The top and bottom plates are end-nailed to each stud with two nails at least in length (16d or 16 penny nails). Studs are at least doubled (creating posts) at openings, the jack stud being cut to receive the lintels(headers) that are placed and end-nailed through the outer studs. Wall sheathing, usually a plywood or other laminate, is usually applied to the framing prior to erection, thus eliminating the need to scaffold, and again increasing speed and cutting manpower needs and expenses. Some types of exterior sheathing, such as asphalt-impregnated fiberboard, plywood, oriented strand board and waferboard, will provide adequate bracing to resist lateral loads and keep the wall square. (Construction codes in most jurisdictions require a stiff plywood sheathing.) Others, such as rigid glass-fiber, asphalt-coated fiberboard, polystyrene or polyurethane board, will not. In this latter case, the wall should be reinforced with a diagonal wood or metal bracing inset into the studs. In jurisdictions subject to strong wind storms (hurricane countries, tornado alleys) local codes or state law will generally require both the diagonal wind braces and the stiff exterior sheathing regardless of the type and kind of outer weather resistant coverings. = Corners = A multiple-stud post made up of at least three studs, or the equivalent, is generally used at exterior corners and intersections to secure a good tie between adjoining walls, and to provide nailing support for interior finishes and exterior sheathing. Corners and intersections, however, must be framed with at least two studs. Nailing support for the edges of the ceiling is required at the junction of the wall and ceiling where partitions run parallel to the ceiling joists. This material is commonly referred to as dead wood or backing. = Exterior wall studs = Wall framing in house construction includes the vertical and horizontal members of exterior walls and interior partitions. These members, referred to as studs, wall plates and lintels, serve as a nailing base for all covering material and support the upper floors, ceiling and roof. Exterior wall studs are the vertical members to which the wall sheathing and cladding are attached. They are supported on a bottom plate or foundation sill and in turn support the top plate. Studs usually consist of or lumber and are commonly spaced at on center. This spacing may be changed to on center depending on the load and the limitations imposed by the type and thickness of the wall covering used. Wider studs may be used to provide space for more insulation. Insulation beyond that which can be accommodated within a stud space can also be provided by other means, such as rigid or semi-rigid insulation or batts between horizontal furring strips, or rigid or semi-rigid insulation sheathing to the outside of the studs. The studs are attached to horizontal top and bottom wall plates of lumber that are the same width as the studs. = Interior partitions = Interior partitions supporting floor, ceiling or roof loads are called loadbearing walls; others are called non-loadbearing or simply partitions. Interior loadbearing walls are framed in the same way as exterior walls. Studs are usually lumber spaced at on center. This spacing may be changed to depending on the loads supported and the type and thickness of the wall finish used. Partitions can be built with or studs spaced at on center depending on the type and thickness of the wall finish used. Where a partition does not contain a swinging door, studs at on center are sometimes used with the wide face of the stud parallel to the wall. This is usually done only for partitions enclosing clothes closets or cupboards to save space. Since there is no vertical load to be supported by partitions, single studs may be used at door openings. The top of the opening may be bridged with a single piece of lumber the same width as the studs. These members provide a nailing support for wall finish, door frames and trim. = Lintels (headers) = Lintels (or, headers) are the horizontal members placed over window, door and other openings to carry loads to the adjoining studs. Lintels are usually constructed of two pieces of 2 in (nominal) (38 mm) lumber separated with spacers to the width of the studs and nailed together to form a single unit. Lintels are predominately nailed together without spacers to form a solid beam and allow the remaining cavity to be filled with insulation from the inside. The preferable spacer material is rigid insulation. The depth of a lintel is determined by the width of the opening and vertical loads supported. = Wall sections = The complete wall sections are then raised and put in place, temporary braces added and the bottom plates nailed through the subfloor to the floor framing members. The braces should have their larger dimension on the vertical and should permit adjustment of the vertical position of the wall. Once the assembled sections are plumbed, they are nailed together at the corners and intersections. A strip of polyethylene is often placed between the interior walls and the exterior wall, and above the first top plate of interior walls before the second top plate is applied to attain continuity of the air barrier when polyethylene is serving this function. A second top plate, with joints offset at least one stud space away from the joints in the plate beneath, is then added. This second top plate usually laps the first plate at the corners and partition intersections and, when nailed in place, provides an additional tie to the framed walls. Where the second top plate does not lap the plate immediately underneath at corner and partition intersections, these may be tied with galvanized steel plates at least wide and long, nailed with at least three nails to each wall.  Balloon framing  upright=1.3 Balloon framing is a method of wood construction also known as \\"Chicago construction\\" in the 19th century used primarily in areas rich in softwood forests: Scandinavia, Canada, the United States up until the mid-1950s, and around Thetford Forest in Norfolk, England. It uses long continuous framing members (studs) that run from the sill plate to the top plate, with intermediate floor structures let into and nailed to them. Here the heights of window sills, headers and next floor height would be marked out on the studs with a story pole. Once popular when long lumber was plentiful, balloon framing has been largely replaced by platform framing. It is not certain who introduced balloon framing in the United States. However, the first building using balloon framing was possibly a warehouse constructed in 1832 in Chicago, Illinois, by George Washington Snow. Architectural critic Sigfried Giedion cited Chicago architect John M. Van Osdel's 1880s attribution, as well as A. T. Andreas' 1885 History of Chicago, to credit Snow as 'inventor of the balloon frame method'. In 1833, Augustine Taylor (1796‚Äì1891) constructed St. Mary's Catholic Church in Chicago using the balloon framing method. > In the 1830s, Hoosier Solon Robinson published articles about a > revolutionary new framing system, called \\"balloon framing\\" by later > builders. Robinson's system called for standard 2x4 lumber, nailed together > to form a sturdy, light skeleton. Builders were reluctant to adopt the new > technology, however, by the 1880s, some form of 2x4 framing was standard. Alternatively, a precursor to the balloon frame may have been used by the French in Missouri as much as thirty-one years earlier. The name comes from a French Missouri type of construction, maison en boulin, boulin being a French term for a horizontal scaffolding support. Historians have also fabricated the following story: As Taylor was constructing his first such building, St. Mary's Church, in 1833, skilled carpenters looked on at the comparatively thin framing members, all held together with nails, and declared this method of construction to be no more substantial than a balloon. It would surely blow over in the next wind! Though the criticism proved baseless, the name stuck. Although lumber was plentiful in 19th-century America, skilled labor was not. The advent of cheap machine-made nails, along with water-powered sawmills in the early 19th century made balloon framing highly attractive, because it did not require highly skilled carpenters, as did the dovetail joints, mortises and tenons required by post-and-beam construction. For the first time, any farmer could build his own buildings without a time-consuming learning curve.Robinson, Salon. \\"How to Build Balloon Frames\\". Transactions of the American Institute of the City of New York for the year 1854 no. 144. Albany:C. Van Benthuysen, 1855. 405‚Äì408. https://books.google.com/books?id=MyU2AQAAIAAJ&pg; accessed January 10, 2013 It has been said that balloon framing populated the western United States and the western provinces of Canada. Without it, western boomtowns certainly could not have blossomed overnight. It is also likely that, by radically reducing construction costs, balloon framing improved the shelter options of poorer North Americans. For example, many 19th-century New England working neighborhoods consist of balloon-constructed three-story apartment buildings referred to as triple deckers. However, balloon framing did require very long studs and as tall trees were exhausted in the 1920s, platform framing became prevalent. An unusual example of balloon framing: The Jim Kaney Round Barn, Adeline, Illinois, U.S.A. The main difference between platform and balloon framing is at the floor lines. The balloon wall studs extend from the sill of the first story all the way to the top plate or end rafter of the second story. The platform-framed wall, on the other hand, is independent for each floor.Framing floors, walls, and ceilings. Newtown, CT: Taunton Press, 2005. 118.  Materials  Light-frame materials are most often wood or rectangular steel, tubes or C-channels. Wood pieces are typically connected with nail fasteners, nails, or screws; steel pieces are connected with pan-head framing screws, or nuts and bolts. Preferred species for linear structural members are softwoods such as spruce, pine and fir. Light frame material dimensions range from ; i.e., a Dimensional number two-by-four to 5 cm by 30 cm (two-by-twelve inches) at the cross-section, and lengths ranging from for walls to or more for joists and rafters. Recently, architects have begun experimenting with pre-cut modular aluminum framing to reduce on-site construction costs. Wall panels built of studs are interrupted by sections that provide rough openings for doors and windows. Openings are typically spanned by a header or lintel that bears the weight of the structure above the opening. Headers are usually built to rest on trimmers, also called jacks. Areas around windows are defined by a sill beneath the window, and cripples, which are shorter studs that span the area from the bottom plate to the sill and sometimes from the top of the window to a header, or from a header to a top plate. Diagonal bracings made of wood or steel provide shear (horizontal strength) as do panels of sheeting nailed to studs, sills and headers. Light-gauge metal stud framing Wall sections usually include a bottom plate which is secured to the structure of a floor, and one, or more often two top plates that tie walls together and provide a bearing for structures above the wall. Wood or steel floor frames usually include a rim joist around the perimeter of a system of floor joists, and often include bridging material near the center of a span to prevent lateral buckling of the spanning members. In two-story construction, openings are left in the floor system for a stairwell, in which stair risers and treads are most often attached to squared faces cut into sloping stair stringers. Interior wall coverings in light-frame construction typically include wallboard, lath and plaster or decorative wood paneling. Exterior finishes for walls and ceilings often include plywood or composite sheathing, brick or stone veneers, and various stucco finishes. Cavities between studs, usually placed apart, are usually filled with insulation materials, such as fiberglass batting, or cellulose filling sometimes made of recycled newsprint treated with boron additives for fire prevention and vermin control. In natural building, straw bales, cob and adobe may be used for both exterior and interior walls. The part of a structural building that goes diagonally across a wall is called a T-bar. It stops the walls from collapsing in gusty winds.  Roofs  Phoenix, Arizona. A roof being framed in the United States circa 1955 Roofs are usually built to provide a sloping surface intended to shed rain or snow, with slopes ranging from 1:15 (less than an inch per linear foot of horizontal span), to steep slopes of more than 2:1. A light-frame structure built mostly inside sloping walls which also serve as a roof is called an A-frame. Roofs are most often covered with shingles made of asphalt, fiberglass and small gravel coating, but a wide range of materials are used. Molten tar is often used to waterproof flatter roofs, but newer materials include rubber and synthetic materials. Steel panels are popular roof coverings in some areas, preferred for their durability. Slate or tile roofs offer more historic coverings for light-frame roofs. Light-frame methods allow easy construction of unique roof designs; hip roofs, for example, slope toward walls on all sides and are joined at hip rafters that span from corners to a ridge. Valleys are formed when two sloping roof sections drain toward each other. Dormers are small areas in which vertical walls interrupt a roof line, and which are topped off by slopes at usually right angles to a main roof section. Gables are formed when a length-wise section of sloping roof ends to form a triangular wall section. Clerestories are formed by an interruption along the slope of a roof where a short vertical wall connects it to another roof section. Flat roofs, which usually include at least a nominal slope to shed water, are often surrounded by parapet walls with openings (called scuppers) to allow water to drain out. Sloping crickets are built into roofs to direct water away from areas of poor drainage, such as behind a chimney at the bottom of a sloping section.  Structure  Light-frame buildings in areas with shallow or nonexistent frost depths are often erected on monolithic concrete-slab foundations that serve both as a floor and as a support for the structure. Other light-frame buildings are built over a crawlspace or a basement, with wood or steel joists used to span between foundation walls, usually constructed of poured concrete or concrete blocks. Engineered components are commonly used to form floor, ceiling and roof structures in place of solid wood. I-joists (closed-web trusses) are often made from laminated woods, most often chipped poplar wood, in panels as thin as , glued between horizontally laminated members of less than 4 cm by 4 cm (two-by- twos), to span distances of as much as . Open web trussed joists and rafters are often formed of 4 cm by 9 cm (two-by-four) wood members to provide support for floors, roofing systems and ceiling finishes. Platform framing was traditionally limited to four floors but some jurisdictions have modified their building codes to allow up to six floors with added fire protection.

A seal can be any impression made upon the document by the parties to the contract. This was traditionally done in wax stating the intentions of the parties to be bound by the contract. Only parties to a sealed document are the people who have rights under it, thus only people party to the contract can be found liable. According to Harvey Boller, J.D. Professor of Law at Loyola University, roughly 100 percent of contracts today are informal contracts. The legitimacy of a contract, however, does not rely upon whether a contract is formal or informal. Both are considered binding, given all other elements of a contract exist. In which both parties agree to each comply with each other's wishes to a certain limit. Usually, the contract is formed by a greater authority, such as a government, or corporation. The Twelfth Edition of Business Law: Text Cases (Clarkson, Miller & Cross), says that formal contracts are, \\"contracts that require a special form or method of creation to be enforceable.\\" It uses negotiable instruments as an example of formal contracts, such as: checks, drafts, promissory notes, and certificates of deposit.

By it, rural and farm life forms are idealized as a counterweight to urban ones. It is tied to the contemporaneous German concept of Lebensraum, the belief that the German people were to expand into Eastern Europe, conquering and displacing the native Slavic and Baltic population via Generalplan Ost. \\"Blood and soil\\" was a key slogan of Nazi ideology. The nationalist ideology of the Artaman League and the writings of Richard Walther Darr√© guided agricultural policies which were later adopted by Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler and Baldur von Schirach. Rise The German expression was coined in the late 19th century, in tracts espousing racialism/racism and romantic nationalism. It produced a regionalist literature, with some social criticism. This romantic attachment was widespread prior to the rise of the Nazis.Robert Cecil, The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology p165 . Marie-Luise Heuser, Was Gr√ºn begann endete blutigrot. Von der Naturromantik zu den Reagrarisierungs- und Entv√∂lkerungspl√§nen der SA und SS, in: Dieter Hassenpflug (Hrsg.), Industrialismus und √ñkoromantik. Geschichte und Perspektiven der √ñkologisierung, Wiesbaden 1991, S. 43-62, . Major figures in 19th-century German agrarian romanticism included Ernst Moritz Arndt and Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl, who argued that the peasantry represented the foundation of the German people and conservatism.Paul Brassley, Yves Segers, Leen Van Van Molle (ed.) (2012). War, Agriculture, and Food: Rural Europe from the 1930s to the 1950s. p. 197. Routledge, Ultranationalists predating the Nazis often supported country living as more healthy, with the Artaman League sending urban children to the countryside to work in part in hopes of transforming them into Wehrbauern (lit. \\"soldier peasants\\").Heather Pringle, The Master Plan: Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust, p39 Richard Walther Darr√© popularized the phrase at the time of the rise of Nazi Germany; he wrote a book called Neuadel aus Blut und Boden (A New Nobility Based On Blood And Soil) in 1930, which proposed a systematic eugenics program, arguing for selective breeding as a cure-all for the problems plaguing the state.Barbara Miller Lane, Leila J. Rupp, Nazi Ideology Before 1933: A Documentation p. 110-1 In 1928, he had also written the book Peasantry as the Life Source of the Nordic Race, in which he presented his theory that the alleged difference between Nordic people and Southeastern Europeans was based in the Nordic people‚Äôs connection to superior land.Gustavo Corni, ‚ÄúRichard Walther Darr√©: The Blood and Soil Ideologue,‚Äù in Ronald Smelser and Rainer Zitelman, eds., The Nazi Elite (New York: New York University Press, 1993), 19. Darr√© was an influential member of the Nazi Party and a noted race theorist who assisted the party greatly in gaining support among common Germans outside the cities. Prior to their ascension to power, Nazis called for a return from the cities to the countryside. This agrarian sentiment allowed opposition to both the middle class and the aristocracy, and presented the farmer as a superior figure beside the moral swamp of the city.David Schoenbaum, Hitler's Social Revolution: Class and Status in Nazi Germany, 1933-1939, p 161-2 Garden City, NY Doubleday, 1966. Nazi ideology Richard Walther Darr√© addressing a meeting of the farming community in Goslar on 13 December 1937 standing in front of a Reichsadler and Swastika crossed with a sword and wheat sheaf labelled Blood and Soil (from the German Federal Archive) The doctrine not only called for a \\"back to the land\\" approach and re-adoption of \\"rural values\\"; it held that German land was bound, perhaps mystically, to German blood. Peasants were the Nazi cultural heroes, who held charge of German racial stock and German history‚Äîas when a memorial of a medieval peasant uprising was the occasion for a speech by Darr√© praising them as a force and purifier of German history.George Lachmann Mosse, Nazi culture: intellectual, cultural and social life in the Third Reich p. 134 Agrarianism was asserted as the only way to truly understand the \\"natural order.\\"\\"Not Empty Phrases, but Rather Clarity \\" Urban culture was decried as a weakness, \\"asphalt culture,\\" that only the F√ºhrer's will could eliminate ‚Äî sometimes, as a code for Jewish influence. It contributed to the Nazi ideal of a woman: a sturdy peasant, who worked the land and bore strong children, contributing to praise for athletic women tanned by outdoor work.Leila J. Rupp, Mobilizing Women for war, p45-6, That country women gave birth to more children than city ones was also a factor in the support.Richard Bessel, Nazism and War, p 61 Carl Schmitt argued that a people would develop laws appropriate to its \\"blood and soil\\" because authenticity required loyalty to the Volk over abstract universals. Neues Volk displayed anti-Semitic demographic charts to deplore the alleged destruction of Aryan families' farmland and claim that the Jews were eradicating traditional German peasantry. Posters for schools depicted the flight of people from the countryside to the city.\\"Nazi Racial School Charts \\" The German National Catechism, German propaganda widely used in schools, also spun tales of how farmers supposedly lost ancestral lands and had to move to the city, with all its demoralizing effects:\\"Nazi anti-Semitic Catechism \\" Nazi implementation The program received far more ideological and propaganda support than concrete changes. When Gottfried Feder tried to settle workers in villages about decentralized factories, generals and Junkers successfully opposed him. Generals objected because it interfered with rearmament, and Junkers because it would prevent their exploiting their estates for the international market. It would also require the breakup of Junker estates for independent farmers, which was not implemented. The Reichserbhofgesetz, the State Hereditary Farm Law of 1933, implemented this ideology, stating that its aim was to: \\"preserve the farming community as the blood-source of the German people\\" (Das Bauerntum als Blutquelle des deutschen Volkes erhalten). Selected lands were declared hereditary and could not be mortgaged or alienated, and only these farmers were entitled to call themselves Bauern or \\"farmer peasant\\", a term the Nazis attempted to refurbish from a neutral or even pejorative to a positive term. Regional custom was only allowed to decide whether the eldest or the youngest son was to be the heir. In areas where no particular custom prevailed, the youngest son was to be the heir. During the Nazi era the eldest son inherited the farm in most cases.German Law and Legislation https://archive.org/stream/GermanLawAndLegislation_762/GermanLawAndLegislation_djvu.txt Priority was given to the patriline, so that, if there were no sons, the brothers and brothers' sons of the deceased peasant had precedence over the peasant's own daughters. The countryside was also regarded as the best place to raise infantry, and as having an organic harmony between landowner and peasant, unlike the \\"race chaos\\" of the industrial cities.Robert Cecil, The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology p166 It also prevented Jews from farming: \\"Only those of German blood may be farmers.\\" The concept was a factor in the requirement of a year of land service for members of Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls. This period of compulsory service was required after completion of a student's basic education, before he or she could engage in advanced studies or become employed. Although working on a farm was not the only approved form of service, it was a common one; the aim was to bring young people back from the cities, in the hope that they would, then, stay \\"on the land\\".Lynn H. Nicholas, Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web p 110-1 In 1942, 600,000 boys and 1.4 million girls were sent to help bring in the harvest. The concept was one of the reasons for the creation of the Reich Harvest Thanksgiving Festival whose main purpose was the recognition of the achievements of the German farmers (as well as the propagation of nationalist, anti-Semitic ideologies). =Lebensraum= Origin of German colonisers in annexed Polish territories. Was set in action \\"Heim ins Reich\\" Blood and soil was one of the foundations of the concept of Lebensraum, \\"living space\\".\\"Blood & Soil: Blut und Boden\\" By expanding eastward and transforming those lands into breadbaskets, another blockade, such as that of World War I, would not cause massive food shortages, as that one had, a factor that aided the resonance of \\"Blood and soil\\" for the German population.Richard Bessel, Nazism and War, p 60 Even Alfred Rosenberg, not hostile to the Slavs as such, regarded their removal from this land, where Germans had once lived, as necessary because of the unity of blood and soil. Mein Kampf prescribed as the unvarying aim of foreign policy the necessity of obtaining land and soil for the German people (again, \\"German people\\" defined by the Nazi Party as racially pure).Andrew Roberts The Storm of War, p 144 While discussing the question of Lebensraum to the east, Hitler envisioned a Ukrainian \\"breadbasket\\" and expressed particular hostility to its \\"Russian\\" cities as hotbeds of Russianness and Communism, forbidding Germans to live in them and declaring that they should be destroyed in the war.Karel C. Berkhoff, Harvest of Despair: Life and Death in Ukraine Under Nazi Rule p35-6 Even during the war itself, Hitler gave orders that Leningrad was to be razed with no consideration given for the survival and feeding of its population.Edwin P. Hoyt, Hitler's War p187 This also called for industry to die off in these regions.Karel C. Berkhoff, Harvest of Despair: Life and Death in Ukraine Under Nazi Rule p45 The Wehrbauer, or soldier-peasants, who were to settle there were not to marry townswomen, but only peasant women who had not lived in towns. This would also encourage large families.Gerhard L. Weinberg, Visions of Victory: The Hopes of Eight World War II Leaders p 23 Furthermore, this land, held by \\"tough peasant races\\", would serve as a bulwark against attack from Asia.Michael Sontheimer, \\"When We Finish, Nobody Is Left Alive \\" 05/27/2011 Spiegel Influence on art =Fiction= Prior to the Nazi take- over, two popular genres were the Heimat-Roman, or regional novel, and Schollen-Roman, or novel of the soil, which was also known as Blut-und-Boden. This literature was vastly increased, the term being contracted into a slogan \\"Blu-Bo\\", and developed a mysticism of unity.Pierre Aycoberry The Nazi Question, p8 Pantheon Books New York 1981 It also combined war literature with the figure of the soldier-peasant, uncontaminated by the city. These books were generally set in the nominal past, but their invocation of the passing of the seasons often gave them an air of timelessness. \\"Blood and soil\\" novels and theater celebrated the farmer's life and their fertility, often mystically linking them. One of the anti-Semitic fabrications in the children's book Der Giftpilz was the claim that the Talmud described farming as the most lowly of occupations.\\"What is the Talmud? \\" It also included an account of a Jewish financier forcing a German to sell his farm as seen by a neighbor boy; deeply distressed, the boy resolved never to let a Jew into his house, for which his father praised him, on the grounds that peasants must remember that Jews will always take their land.\\"How a German Peasant Was Driven from House and Farm \\" =Fine art= During the Nazi period in Germany, one of the charges put forward against certain works of art was that \\"Art must not be isolated from blood and soil.\\" Failure to meet this standard resulted in the attachment of the label, \\"degenerate art\\", to offending pieces. In art of the Third Reich, both landscape paintings and figures reflected blood-and-soil ideology.The Greater German Art Exhibitions Indeed, some Nazi art exhibits were explicitly titled \\"Blood and Soil\\". Artists frequently gave otherwise apolitical paintings such titles as \\"German Land\\" or \\"German Oak\\". Rural themes were heavily favored in painting. Landscape paintings were featured most heavily in the Greater German Art Exhibitions.Frederic Spotts, Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics, p 176 While drawing on German Romantic traditions, painted landscapes were expected to be firmly based on real landscapes, the German people's Lebensraum, without religious overtones. Peasants were also popular images, promoting a simple life in harmony with nature. This art showed no sign of the mechanization of farm work. The farmer labored by hand, with effort and struggle. The acceptance of this art by the peasant family was also regarded as an important element.George Mosse, Nazi culture: intellectual, cultural and social life in the Third Reich p. 137 =Film= Under Richard Walther Darr√©, The Staff Office of Agriculture produced the short propaganda film Blut und Boden, which was displayed at Nazi party meetings as well as in public cinemas throughout Germany. Other Blut und Boden films likewise stressed the commonality of Germanness and the countryside. Die goldene Stadt has the heroine running away to the city, resulting in her pregnancy and abandonment; she drowns herself, and her last words beg her father to forgive her for not loving the countryside as he did. The film Ewiger Wald (The Eternal Forest) depicted the forest as being beyond the vicissitudes of history, and the German people the same because they were rooted in the story; it depicted the forest sheltering ancient Aryan Germans, Arminius, and the Teutonic Knights, facing the peasants wars, being chopped up by war and industry, and being humiliated by occupation with black soldiers, but culminated in a neo-pagan May Day celebration.Pierre Aycoberry The Nazi Question, p11 Pantheon Books New York 1981 In The Journey to Tilsit, the Polish seductress is portrayed as an obvious product of debased \\"asphalt culture\\" (urbanity) but the virtuous German wife is a country-dweller in traditional costume. Many other commercial films of the Nazi era featured gratuitous, lingering shots of the Nazi landscape and idealized Aryan couples.David Welch, Propaganda and the German Cinema, 1933-1945 (London: I.B. Tauris Publishers, 1983), 84. Japanese usage An Investigation of Global Policy with the Yamato Race as Nucleus made extensive use of the term, usually in quotation marks, and showing an extensive debt to the Nazi usage.John W. Dower, War Without Mercy: Race & Power in the Pacific War p. 265 Modern use North American white supremacists, white nationalists, Neo-Nazis and members of the alt-right have adopted the slogan. It gained widespread public prominence as a result of the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, when participants carrying torches marched on the University of Virginia campus on the night of 11 August 2017 and were recorded chanting the slogan, among others. The rally was organized to protest the town's planned removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. The rally remained in national news through December 2018 thanks to the trial of James Alex Fields, a white supremacist who purposefully ran his car into a crowd of counter- protestors, killing 32-year old paralegal Heather Heyer. The chant was also heard in October 2017 at the \\"White Lives Matter\\" rally in Shelbyville, Tennessee. In his farewell letter, US Senator John McCain stated that America is \\"a nation of ideals, not blood and soil\\", specifically rejecting such notions.https://www.pbs.org/weta/washingtonweek/web-video/sen-john-mccains- words-farewell See also * Bumiputera (Malaysia) * Eco-fascism * Ethnic nationalism * Integralism * Irredentism * Jus soli * Jus sanguinis * Nazi art * Nazi propaganda * Nativism (politics) * Nazi eugenics * Race (human categorization) * Reichserbhofgesetz * Reichsn√§hrstand * V√∂lkisch movement References = Bibliography =  * External links * The Doctrine of Blut und Boden * Fascist Ecology: The \\"Green Wing\\" of the Nazi Party and its Historical Antecedents * Blood and Soil (Harpers) (subscription required) Category:Nazi terminology Category:Agrarian politics Category:Society in Nazi Germany Category:Political catchphrases ","title":"Blood and soil"},{"id":"2071464","text":"Basler Zeitung (literally: \\"Basler Newspaper\\"), or BaZ, is a Swiss German- language regional daily newspaper, published in Basel.

Through his public affairs firm, Berman and Company, he runs several industry-funded non-profit organizations such as the Center for Consumer Freedom,Website of the Center for Consumer Freedom the Center for Union Facts, and the Employment Policies Institute. His organizations have run numerous media campaigns concerning obesity, soda taxation, smoking, cruelty to animals, mad cow disease, taxes, the national debt, drinking and driving, as well as the minimum wage. Through the courts and media campaigns, his company challenges regulations sought by consumer, safety and environmental groups.USA Today article: \\"Got a nasty fight? Here's your man\\", USA Today, July 31, 2006.Lipton, Eric (9 February 2014.). Fight Over Minimum Wage Illustrates Web of Industry Ties. The New York Times. Retrieved 12 February 2014. Early life and family Berman grew up in the Bronx borough of New York City. His father ran gas stations and car washes. Berman did general labor at these businesses on weekends and summers while growing up. He attended Transylvania University in Kentucky. After graduating from college in 1964, Berman went on to William and Mary School of Law and was class of 1967. His late son was Silver Jews musician David Berman, who died by suicide on August 7, 2019 at age 52. The two had been estranged due to David's strong disapproval of his father's work. Career After law school, Berman worked as a labor law attorney for Bethlehem Steel, and from 1969 to 1972 he served as a corporate lawyer for Dana, an automotive parts company in Toledo, Ohio. From 1972 to 1974 he was employed as labor law director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C. He moved into the food and beverage industry in 1975 under the mentorship of Norman Brinker, founder and owner of the Steak & Ale chain of restaurants. Berman started a government affairs program, launched his first PAC for Brinker, and worked there until 1984. He served as executive vice president of Pillsbury Restaurant Group from 1984 to 1986. In 1986, he formed Berman and Company. In 1991, he created the Employment Policies Institute to research entry-level work issues and argue \\"the importance of minimum wage jobs for the poor and uneducated.\\" In practice, this translated to opposing minimum wage hikes on the theory that they would reduce employment. In the 1990s, Berman was the president of Beverage Retailers Against Drunk Driving (BRADD), an organization formed to combat Mothers Against Drunk Driving. As president, he argued for \\"tolerance of social drinking.\\" He has also worked as a consultant for the Minimum Wage Coalition to Save Jobs. In a document released by The New York Times on October 30, 2014, from a talk Berman gave to the Western Energy Alliance, Berman reassured potential donors about the concern that they might be found out as a supporter of one of his organizations: \\"We run all of this stuff through nonprofit organizations that are insulated from having to disclose donors. There is total anonymity.\\" He also touted his \\"win ugly\\" method of personal attacks on labor union leaders, environmentalists, and others who opposed him. Organizations  As of May 2009, Berman was the sole owner and executive director of Berman and Company, a for-profit management firm that ran fifteen corporate-funded groups, including the Center for Consumer Freedom. He has held at least sixteen positions within these interlocking organizations. As of 2010, just six of these nonprofits provided as much as 70% of Berman and Company's revenue. Bloomberg News reported that from 2008 to 2010, Berman and Company was paid $15 million from donations to his five nonprofit organizations. Through these organizations, Berman and Company has received 60 \\"POLLIE Awards\\" since 2002 from the American Association of Political Consultants. Organizations founded and managed by Berman include: =The Center for Organization Research and Education= The Center for Organizational Research and Education (CORE), formerly the Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF) and Guest Choice Network (GCN), is a non-profit advocate for the food industry and was formed in 1995 with funding from tobacco giant Phillip Morris.UCSF's Legacy Tobacco Documents Library records show an $800,000 check in December 1995 and a $200,000 check in May 1996 written to Guest Choice Network and Berman.Washington Post article: \\"The Escalating Obesity Wars: Nonprofit's Tactics, Funding Sources Spark Controversy\\". CORE generally promotes freedom of choice in the marketplace against what it believes is encroachment by government or scare tactics promulgated by activist groups. CCF also runs the awareness campaign HumaneWatchHumaneWatch.org website, maintained by the Center for Consumer Freedom. and PETA Kills Animals, which criticize the practices of HSUS and PETA, respectively.PETAKillsAnimals.com website, maintained by the Center for Consumer Freedom. These campaigns raise awareness that \\"The Humane Society of the United States gives less than one percent of the money it raises to local pet shelters\\", and that \\"PETA kills 89% of the adoptable dogs and cats in its care\\". Berman's attacks on animal organizations have gained support from many individuals and organizations working in the agriculture and agribusiness sector. In March 2013, Charity Navigator issued a Donor Advisory advising that \\"the majority of the Center for Consumer Freedom's program expenses are being directed to its CEO Richard Berman's for-profit management company, Berman and Company\\". The Chicago Tribune depicted CCF as an organization that \\"employs razor-sharp wit and unconventional tactics.\\" Berman and Company does not publicly name its clients; 60 Minutes obtained a list of companies that funded the Center for Consumer Freedom in 2002. Among the parties named were The Coca-Cola Company, Tyson Foods, Outback Steakhouse, Wendy's International, Inc., Brinker International (parent company of Chili's and Macaroni Grill), Arby's, Hooters,Berman's Battle \\"The American Prospect\\". and Red Lobster. =American Beverage Institute= The American Beverage Institute (ABI) is a trade association opposed to laws intended to criminalize alcohol consumption, including the push to further lower existing blood-alcohol arrest thresholds. =Employment Policies Institute= The Employment Policies Institute (EPI) is a nonprofit research center opposed to raising the minimum wage, particularly in the labor-intensive restaurant industry.

HSUS has carried out its own investigations of CCF and Berman, and filed complaints about CCF with the IRS. CCF has responded by filing its own complaint with the IRS against HSUS. Labor groups pushing to increase the minimum wage are also taking a tough line against Berman and his clients. The Restaurant Opportunities Center has taken an aggressive approach in its campaigns against Berman's base of support within the National Restaurant Association and related enterprises. In a January 4, 2015 article, Salon criticized Berman as a propagandist, \\"a gifted translator of biz-think into the common sense of the millions\\". On February 3, 2015, an opinion piece in Guns Magazine passed criticism that Berman received for putting profit over principle was countered with the claim that critics have not \\"made that case with examples of documented unethical practices, or by refuting anything the man, who decries a government nanny state and endorses personal responsibility, claims.\\"Codrea Exclusive: ‚ÄúGreen Decoys‚Äù Lure Sportsmen Into Deceptive Trap Guns Magazine, Rights watch, 3 February 2015 Berman has responded to such criticism by stating that his groups have acted as \\"watchdogs who question the motivation, tactics and fundraising efforts of these powerful groups\\" and that targets \\"throw mud\\" instead of \\"debating the actual issues\\".

The album was reissued on CD by Sub Pop in 1993, augmented by the three tracks from the Alien Boy EP. In 2001, it was digitally remastered by Sage and reissued again on his own Zeno Records as part of a 3-CD set, with the track list altered so that the song \\"Alien Boy\\" appeared together with the other three tracks from the Alien Boy EP, after \\"Wait a Minute\\". It was reissued on LP by Jackpot Records in 2006, remastered again from the original tapes that Sage provided to the label. Release and reception Initially wanting to put it out through his own Trap Records, Sage decided to release the album through Park Avenue Records, hoping that it would give them slightly wider distribution. Before it was released, Park Avenue insisted that the band re-record the album at a professional studio, as it was originally recorded at the band's rehearsal studio on a 4-track recorder. When finally released, the album was not promoted and received little attention, only developing a cult following in the band's hometown. Reviewing for The Village Voice in 1980, Robert Christgau wrote, \\"Three guys from Portland (Oregon, but it might just as well be Maine) who caught on to punk unfashionably late and for that reason sound like they're still discovering something. Which hardly makes them unique --there are similar bands in dozens if not hundreds of American cities, many of whom send me records. What distinguishes this one is Greg Sage's hard-edged vocals--detached but never silly, passionate but never overwrought--and economical one-hook construction\\". The album (and the band's music in general) gained a slightly wider audience during the early 1990s when grunge band Nirvana covered the songs \\"Return of the Rat\\" and \\"D-7\\" on a Wipers tribute album and the group's Hormoaning EP. In 1993, Nirvana vocalist/guitarist Kurt Cobain listed Is This Real? at No. 46 in the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his Journals. BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel stated in a 1993 interview that it was one of his top 20 favorite albums. Is This Real? later came to be regarded as a classic punk rock album of the 1980s. Stephen Howell of AllMusic, in his retrospective review, rated the album 4 out of 5 stars and stated that the production \\"leaves much to be desired with its tinny-sounding drums, but fortunately, the negatives don't outweigh the positives.\\" He also said that Sage wrote \\"fairly simplistic songs with power chords, but each melody infects your brain like a fever\\" and noted that much of the album has a dark and ominous feel. Cover versions Apart from the aforementioned Nirvana cover, \\"Return of the Rat\\" was also covered by Bored! on their album Scuzz. The track \\"Mystery\\" was covered by numerous bands including Eagulls, JEFF the Brotherhood, Shellshag, Rose Melberg, and Meat Wave. \\"Up Front\\" was covered by Poison Idea and Corin Tucker, \\"Potential Suicide\\" by Napalm Beach, and \\"Wait A Minute\\" by My Vitriol.

Azra was formed in 1977 by its frontman Branimir \\"Johnny\\" ≈†tuliƒá. The other two members of the original line-up were Mi≈°o Hrnjak (bass) and Boris Leiner (drums). The band is named after a verse \\"Und der Sklave sprach: ‚ÄúIch hei√üe Mohamet, ich bin aus Yemen, Und mein Stamm sind jene Asra, Welche sterben, wenn sie lieben.‚Äù\\" (trans. \\"My name is El Muhamed/From the tribe of the old Azras/who die for love/And die when they kiss!\\") from \\"Der Asra\\" by Heinrich Heine. They are considered to be one of the most influential bands from the Yugoslav new wave rock era and the Yugoslav rock scene in general. They released their first single in 1979 with songs \\"Balkan\\" and \\"A ≈°ta da radim\\". The first album named Azra was published in 1980 and achieved commercial success and popularized Azra in Yugoslavia. Their second album was released in 1981. Azra recorded its last studio album Izmeƒëu krajnosti (Between the Extremes) in 1987. In 1988 the band recorded 4LP live album under the name Zadovolj≈°tina (Satisfaction), after which ≈†tuliƒá disbanded the band. ≈†tuliƒá recorded three more solo albums since moving to the Netherlands, where he lives in seclusion. A 2003 rock documentary, Sretno dijete depicts Azra as the focus of the rock scene in Yugoslavia during the 1980s, along with Bijelo dugme. Even today, Azra remains very popular among youth in the countries of the former Yugoslavia. In 1998, the music critics compiled a list of 100 best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music. Five Azra albums were included, three of them in top 10. On the Radio B92's list of 100 greatest songs of former Yugoslavia, four Azra songs were included, all of them in top 20.

Biography Asclepigenia studied and taught, alongside her brother Hiero, at the Neoplatonic school of Athens. The school contended with the more scientific school in Alexandria.Waithe, Mary Ellen (1987) A History of Women Philosophers. Ancient Women Philosophers 600 B.C. ‚Äì 500 A.D. Dordrecht: Kluwer. LIke other Neoplatonists of the time, she mainly studied Aristotle and Plato, but also her father‚Äôs own philosophy. She lived in a historical context of turmoil due to the conflict between Neoplatonic metaphysics, which was taught in Plutarch‚Äôs academy, and Christianity, which had been gaining in popularity at the time. Plutarch of Athens‚Äô philosophy worked to unify the teachings of Aristotle and Plato, and by doing so brought together the opposing pagan ideas of theurgy and mysticism (magic), which he had learned from his father, Nestorius, and then passed that knowledge onto Asclepigenia.\\"Asclepigenia.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. After Plutarch‚Äôs death, she inherited the school as well as how it was to go about teaching its students. Being an acclaimed philosopher at the school in Athens, Asclepigenia went on to teach Proclus, who became her best known student. She taught him, not only the philosophies of Aristotle and Plato, but included teachings her father had passed solely on to her before his passing, in the arts of theurgy and pagan mysticism. Being the expert in the theurgy, Asclepigenia taught from a metaphysical approach. She believed in there being five realms of reality: the One, Nature, Matter, Soul, and Intelligence. Like her father, she believed that every soul held a divine part inside itself, and that a union with the One, combined with magic, pagan thought of the deities, and meditation could result in true happiness for a person, as a way they could control their own fate. Her teachings to Proclus on theurgy, benefited him greatly as he went on to think and develop his own ideas. He also supposedly was able to practice theurgy in such a way that it cured his friend‚Äôs daughter, by use of a divine intervention with one of the gods. https://www.britannica.com/biography/Asclepigenia Print. Asclepigenia continued to teach at the Academy after Proclus went on to perfect his theurgical thoughts and practices. Her most well known achievements were in the arts and practicing rituals in the Chaldean mysticism of theurgy, as well as exceptional thought in Platonic philosophy. She passed along many of Aristotle and Plato‚Äôs teachings to multiple students, including Plutarch. Her reverence in philosophy, as well as an astute female teacher, only adds to the value and importance of who she was in the Greek world. She contributed greatly to the development of Neoplatonic metaphysics and worked alongside many great philosophers, including her brother Hiero. Her advancements have impacted future thought on the practices of theurgy, as well as the arts and magic of the Chaldean mysticism. She is said to have died in the year 485 A.D.

This film is included in television movies and distinguished with theatrical feature films. Another good example of television documentaries is the travel documentaries that are featured in specialized geographical or tourism television channels like the National Geographic Channel. The films might end up showing in film societies or in theaters that specialize in showing documentaries. However, on rare occasions, television documentaries become so popular that they are launched for wider release in movie theaters. History of television documentary and production techniques Televised documentary finds its roots in film, photojournalism, and radio. The emergence of documentary film within its televised format followed the advent of launch of the world‚Äôs first high-definition public television service on 2 November 1936 by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Following this initial broadcast, the BBC‚Äôs television service continued, albeit in limited capacities, up until 1939 with the onset of the Second World War. This suspension lasted throughout the six-year wartime period. Regular television broadcasting was resumed in 1946. The subsequent expansion throughout the coming years of the BBC‚Äôs network towards nationwide coverage, additional channels, as well as the introduction of novel competition into the television network market (notably Independent Television) spurred opportunities for the emergence of televised documentary. In course with the British conception of a televised broadcasting network, television documentary also finds its origins in British media. Traditionally, much of television documentary production was done using 16mm film cameras with quarter-inch tape recorders providing sync sound. The small and agile nature of 16mm film crews made them ideal for shooting documentaries in hostile environments as events were unfolding. Before portable video recorders became commonplace in the industry, 16mm film cameras were the only method of production that did not require significant technological infrastructure. Using just an Arriflex or Eclair 16mm camera, a Nagra tape recorder, and a basic lighting rig these crews created some of the most significant documentaries produced in Britain. This way of working continued until the late 1980s when portable video recorders started to be implemented in documentary production.Ellis, John; Hall, Nick (2017): ADAPT. figshare.

In addition to private funding, it is government-supported and in some ways government-funded. Qatar Foundation (QF), chaired by Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, has spearheaded Qatar's endeavors to establish itself as a leader in education, science, and cultural development on both a regional and global scale. QF has stated an aim \\"to support Qatar on its journey from a carbon economy to a knowledge economy by unlocking human potential.\\" The organization's initiatives are oriented towards education, science and research, and community development. It has solicited a number of international universities to establish campuses in Qatar as part of its goal to develop a youth population with the necessary expertise to maintain a knowledge economy. Its main science and research agenda is developing Qatar's technological capacity by researching new technologies which can be successfully commercialized. In addition to diversifying the economy, this strategy also helps satisfy Qatar's aim of becoming a research and development hub. The foundation's social development programs aim to preserve Qatar's culture, \\"foster a progressive society\\" and to confront pressing social issues. Joint venture partnerships in the areas of design, information and communication technologies, policy studies, and event management also contribute to fulfilling the objectives of Qatar Foundation. Several small Qatari firms have thrived under the auspices of the Foundation; one example being Pragmatech, a subsidiary of United Development Company which has established a reputation for its text processing, document summarizing and referencing software.  Education  = K‚Äì12 education= In primary and secondary education, Qatar Foundation has several initiatives. Examples include establishing five Qatar Academy branches, opening Awsaj Academy, a school for children with learning difficulties, and opening Qatar Leadership Academy in collaboration with the Qatar Armed Forces. Furthermore, the foundation launched the Academic Bridge Program, a post-secondary school program that helps students transition from high school to university. A major reform of the K‚Äì12 education system was embarked upon by Qatar Foundation in 2003, resulting in the formation of the RAND-Qatar Policy Institute and the subsequent publishing of the institute's assessment and recommendations in Education for a New Era: Design and Implementation of K-12 Education Reform in Qatar. As a response to declining standardized test scores, Qatar Foundation terminated its partnership with the RAND Corporation in 2013. =Higher education= In higher education, Qatar Foundation established branch campuses of eight international universities and one home-grown university at the main campus just outside Doha: * 1998 ‚Äì Virginia Commonwealth University, with programs in art and design. * 2002 ‚Äì Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar opened, offering a two-year pre-medical program and a four-year medical program leading to an MD. * 2003 ‚Äì Texas A&M; University at Qatar opened, offering programs in chemical, electrical, petroleum, and mechanical engineering. * 2004 ‚Äì Carnegie Mellon University Qatar opened, offering programs in computer science, business, biological sciences, computational biology, and information systems. * 2005 ‚Äì Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar opened, offering programs in international affairs. * 2008 ‚Äì Northwestern University in Qatar opened, offering programs in journalism and communications. *2010 ‚Äì Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) opened offering graduate programs in Islamic studies, humanities and social sciences, science and engineering, law, health and life sciences and public policy and undergraduate qualification in Computer engineering. HBKU is also the home of three national research institutes conducting mission driven research in energy and environment, computing, and biomedical. * 2011 ‚Äì HEC Paris in Qatar launched the first EMBA in the country. * 2011 ‚Äì University College London Qatar opened, offering postgraduate qualifications in museum studies, conservation, and archaeology in partnership with Qatar Museums Authority. These centers sit alongside the Qatar Faculty of Islamic Studies which began its first graduate classes in the 2007‚Äì2008 academic year. An international center for Islamic thinking and dialogue, it aims to produce scholars who are grounded in Islamic faith, practice and civilization. It offers master's degrees in Islamic finance, contemporary Islamic studies and Islamic public policy. Roughly half of these universities' students are Qatari, and it is claimed that around 90 different nationalities in total are represented by the students, faculty and staff at the Foundation campus. The Foundation has managed to make an impact within its first decade or so in operation. Scholars at the centers such as Weill Cornell Medical College have made contributions to studies on genetics and AIDS, and the peer-reviewed periodical Academic Medicine published a study on Weill Cornell Medical College‚Äôs Medical Ethics and Humanities course for premedical students. The course, first offered in 2003, is designed to prepare students for the medical school curriculum, and the report pointed to challenges such as cross-cultural tensions that could emerge when introducing themes from Western medical ethics and humanities into an Islamic context like Qatar. \\"The authors outline the response to this challenge and strategies to broaden student inquiry without engaging in indoctrination,\\" it said. =Events= WISE Summit As part of the Foundation's activities in education, it sponsors the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE), a global forum that brings together education professionals, opinion leaders and decision-makers from all over the world to discuss educational issues. The summit has been held in Doha since 2009.  Science and research  A program known as the Qatar Science Leadership Program was initiated in 2008 in order to help develop aspiring applied science students. In 2014, the program's first PhD scholar graduated from university. The majority of the universities on Qatar Foundation's campus run their own research programs, often collaborating with QF's own applied research bodies. In addition to the university programs, QF has formed international partnerships, including with the Royal Society and the James Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. Stars of Science, a reality TV show was launched in 2009 in order to discover \\"young Arab innovators\\". The show features Arab innovators who compete to transform ideas into marketable products. A cash prize of $1 million is awarded to the winner. =Research initiatives= A notable research initiative organized by Qatar Foundation is the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), which was established in 2006. The QNRF subsidizes competitively selected research by both local and international researchers for projects that adhere to Qatar's national research strategy. This initiative is geared towards the development of a knowledge-based economy. In 2007, a research division was established at Qatar Foundation to manage developing a scientific community in Qatar. It has hosted several international conferences in the fields of biotechnology, nanotechnology, and stem cell research. The research division also formed the Distinguished Lecture Series, which exposes Qatari students, researchers, and the public to distinguished scientists. The Qatar Science & Technology Park (QSTP), a research and development hub, was inaugurated in March 2009. At an investment of more than $800 million by Qatar Foundation, it became Qatar's first free-trade zone. In 2010, the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) was founded as a vehicle to conduct multidisciplinary applied computing research. Research topics include Arabic language computer technologies, computer security and data analysis. =Environmental initiatives= In the environmental sciences, Qatar Foundation founded the Qatar Green Building Council in 2009 with the aim of promoting the importance of environmental sustainability. The Qatar Environmental & Energy Research Institute (QEERI) was launched in 2011 and encompasses the fields of energy, environment, food and water resources. The institute's vision places an emphasis on the research of alternative energy technology. =Medicine initiatives= Construction of Sidra Medicine in 2014 In 2012, the Qatar Biomedical Research Institute (QBRI) was established to develop translational biomedical research and biotechnology, focusing on diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Another initiative launched by Qatar Foundation is the Sidra Medical and Research Center, which is reportedly the first hospital of its kind in the Middle East region. Endowed with $7.9 billion by Qatar Foundation, it is a large-scale project designed with upscale healthcare and education facilities intended to provide health services to the whole GCC region. After several delays, Sidra's hospital officially opened on 14 January, 2018. =Events= In June 2011, Qatar Foundation hosted the seventh World Conference of Science Journalists, which had been scheduled to be held in Cairo but was moved to Doha as a result of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. In 2012, the 18th United Nations Climate Change Conference (or 'Conference of the Parties', or more commonly 'COP18') was held at Qatar National Convention Centre under the auspices of Qatar Foundation. The inaugural World Innovation Summit for Health (WISH) was launched by Qatar Foundation at the Qatar National Convention Centre in December 2013. The event witnessed over 500 attendees from 40 different countries discuss international health problems.  Community Development  Qatar Foundation's community development initiatives are based on three primary pillars. The first pillar mandates the \\"fostering of a progressive society\\". Secondly, \\"enhancing cultural life and protecting Qatar‚Äôs heritage\\" is enshrined in the foundation's community development policy. This goal is signified by the presence of the a sidra tree in the foundation's logo, a symbol associated with the Islamic Sidrat al-Muntaha and an evergreen tree, Ziziphus spina-christi, which is native to Qatar. The last pillar involves \\"addressing the community's immediate social needs\\". An example of an initiative designed to meet this goal is the Qatar Diabetes Association, which was incorporated in Qatar Foundation in order to raise public awareness of the rising rates of diabetes and assist in its management. =Arts and culture initiatives= An Arabic calligraphy exhibition hosted by Qatar Foundation in September 2014 Al Shaqab, an equine education resource centre, became a member of Qatar Foundation in 2004. The institution is considered a testament to the historic role that horse racing and breeding played in Qatari culture. Facilities include a riding academy, an endurance training complex, and a centre for the breeding and showing of Arabian horses. Al Jazeera Children's Channel (JCC) was launched in 2005 as a joint venture between Al Jazeera and Qatar Foundation with the aim of \\"preserving Arab cultural identity\\". With 90 percent of the channel being owned by Qatar Foundation, it broadcast from the Foundation's Doha campus along with Baraem, the Arabic channel aimed at preschoolers. Al Jazeera announced in 2013 that it was in the process of acquiring full ownership of the channel. In 2006, Qatar National Library (then known as Dar Al Kutub Library) became a member of Qatar Foundation. On November 19, 2012, Moza bint Nasser, chairperson of Qatar Foundation, announced plans for a new national library.Lux, Claudia (2014). \\"Qatar National Library - Architecture as innovation in the Arab world.\\" International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions Journal, 40(3), 174-181; p. 176. Retrieved 29 November 2015. Education City was chosen as the location of the new library. A notable attraction within the library is the Arab and Islamic Heritage section which contains a historic collection of books, periodicals, manuscripts, maps, and scientific instruments dating back to the 15th century. One of the largest online collections of historic records on the Persian Gulf countries was digitized in October 2014 and made available on the website of the Qatar Digital Library (QDL). The website was the culmination of a partnership established between Qatar Foundation, Qatar National Library, and the British Library in 2012. The Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra was formed in 2007 at the behest of Qatar Foundation with an initial budget of $14 million. Founded with a base of around 100 musicians, the orchestra's mission is to augment Qatar's cultural climate by honoring both Arab and Western musical culture through public performances. Qatar Foundation opened Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art in December 2010 in association with Qatar Museums Authority. In addition to hosting exhibitions, the museum holds one of the largest collections of sculptures and paintings by Arab artists in the world. The museum has also published an online encyclopedia of Arab artists. Msheireb Properties (a subsidiary of Qatar Foundation) initiated a $5.5 billion commercial development project in Doha in January 2010. Originally called \\"Heart of Doha\\", the project was renamed \\"Msheireb Downtown Doha\\" in reference to the historical name of the area. =Community initiatives= The Qatar Diabetes Association, founded in 1995, became a member of Qatar Foundation in 1999. Its mission is to provide programs and services to assist the general public in the management and prevention of diabetes. The Social Development Center was established in 1996 by Moza bint Nasser to organize community programs for Qatari families. It promotes the building of stable and self-sufficient families by offering workplace training and providing courses in financial management. Another cardinal goal of the center involves promoting Islamic social values. Qatar Foundation established Reach Out To Asia (ROTA) ‚Äì a charity initiative focused on assisting community development projects in Asian countries ‚Äì in 2005. ROTA campaigns for education in developing countries. The organization has carried out activities in countries such as Pakistan, Indonesia, Lebanon, and Gaza. In 2006, Moza bint Nasser founded The Doha International Family Institute (DIFI). The institute conducts research and promotes scholarship on the legal, sociological and scientific basis of the family as the fundamental unit of society. It has consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (UNECOSOC). =Events= The QatarDebate Center was established in 2007. In addition to organizing workshops and competitions with the intent of raising the standards of open discussion among Qatari students, the center also hosted the World Schools Debating Championship in 2010. Also launched in 2007 was the Qatar Career Fair (QCF), an annual event held at the Qatar National Convention Centre which showcases the range of career options available to Qatari students and graduates. The Qatar National Convention Centre was inaugurated by QF in December 2011. It features a 2,300-seat auditorium.  Joint ventures  Joint ventures in the fields of science and research, education and social development are deemed essential to Qatar's transition from an oil-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, as outlined in the Qatar National Vision 2030. Thus, the Foundation has set up a number of commercial joint ventures with global partners. Profits generated are shared by both parties, with Qatar Foundation's portion being distributed into its core nonprofit activities. Fitch Qatar is a joint venture design company that creates brands and develops corporate identities for businesses and other organizations. It was jointly created by QF with Fitch London. Some of the company's clientele include the National Health Authority, the Qatar Museums Authority, and Barwa Group. Qatar MICE Development Institute (QMDI) is a joint venture created with Singex Global to manage conferences, conventions, and other events. It was formed in 2007. One of the company's main areas of focus is the QF's Qatar National Convention Centre. Vodafone entered in a partnership with QF to establish Vodafone Qatar in 2008. It was granted a fixed telecommunications in September 2008, thereby becoming the second mobile network operator to be licensed in the country. It officially launched its services in Qatar in March 2009. Launched in November 2008, MEEZA is a joint- venture IT service provider catering to businesses. It was established to support Qatar's ICT sector amidst the country's population boom and technological transition. A major agreement was reached by Meeza in December 2015 stipulating the management of Maersk Oil's IT operations in Qatar. Qatar Solar Technologies (QSTec) is an alternative energy company created in 2010 as part of a partnership between Qatar Foundation, SolarWorld and Qatar Development Bank. In December 2011, QSTec announced that it would be constructing a production plant in Ras Laffan Industrial City with a planned initial capacity of 4,000 metric tons of polysilicon every year. In August 2017, SolarWorld founder Frank Asbeck and QSTec bought out SolarWorld in a joint venture deal and rebranded it as SolarWorld Industries. Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Publishing (BQFP), launched in tandem with Bloomsbury Publishing, became the first publishing house to be established in Qatar in December 2008. It formerly published books in Arabic and English with the mission of promoting a culture of literacy throughout the region. It became defunct in December 2015 and all of its publications were incorporated in the newly established HBKU Press, a member of QF. At the time of BQFP's dissolution it had published over 200 books. Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Journals (BQFJ), an open access, peer review academic publisher, was also incorporated in HBKU Press. BQFJ began publishing journal research articles through its website Qscience.com in December 2010, during the 2010 Qatar Foundation Annual Research Forum. The website maintained more than fifteen specialized and multidisciplinary journals in 2014. Sponsorship On 10 December 2010, FC Barcelona announced it had agreed a shirt sponsorship deal worth up to ‚Ç¨170 million with Qatar Sports Investments to place Qatar Foundation's name on the front of the team's shirts, ending Barcelona's tradition of not accepting payment for sponsors displayed on its jersey. The deal included a clause allowing a switch in sponsor after the first two seasons, so Qatar Airways took over as the main sponsor in July 2013. In October 2011, the Wikimedia Foundation announced a plan to work with the Qatar Foundation to support the growth of the Arabic wikipedia. Later, the media reported that the wikipedia page for the Qatar Foundation was allegedly edited by a public relations associate of the foundation, for which there was \\"strong, if circumstantial evidence\\". It was claimed by Qatar Foundation in November 2015 that the partnership had culminated in the creation of over 6,000 articles on the Arabic wikipedia.

Designated collectively as Operation Oboe, a series of amphibious assaults between 1 May and 21 July were conducted by the Australian I Corps, under Lieutenant-General Leslie Morshead, against Imperial Japanese forces who had been occupying the island since late 1941 ‚Äì early 1942. The main Japanese formation on the island was the Thirty-Seventh Army under Lieutenant-General Masao Baba, while the naval garrison was commanded by Vice- Admiral Michiaki Kamada. The Australian ground forces were supported by US and other Allied air and naval forces, with the US providing the bulk of the shipping and logistic support necessary to conduct the operation. The campaign was initially planned to involve six stages, but eventually landings were undertaken at four locations: Tarakan, Labuan, North Borneo and Balikpapan. Guerilla operations were also carried out by Dayak tribesmen and small numbers of Allied personnel in the interior of the island. While major combat operations were concluded by mid-July, mopping-up operations continued throughout Borneo until the end of the war in August. Initially intended to secure vital airfields and port facilities to support future operations, preparatory bombardment resulted in heavy damage to the island's infrastructure, including its oil production facilities. As a result, the strategic benefits the Allies gained from the campaign were negligible.  Background  Prior to World War II, Borneo was divided between British Borneo, in the north of the island and Dutch Borneo in the south; the latter formed part of the Netherlands East Indies (NEI). As of 1941, the island's population was estimated to be 3 million. The great majority lived in small villages, with Borneo having less than a dozen towns. Borneo has a tropical climate and was mainly covered by dense jungle at the time of World War II. Most of the coastline was lined with mangroves or swamps. Borneo was strategically important during World War II. The European colonisers had developed oil fields and their holdings exported other raw materials. The island's location was also significant, as it sat across the main sea routes between north Asia, Malaya and the NEI. Despite this, Borneo was under- developed, and had few roads and only a single railroad. Most travel was by watercraft or narrow paths. The British and Dutch also stationed only small military forces in Borneo to protect their holdings. Borneo was rapidly conquered by the Japanese in the opening weeks of the Pacific War. The purpose of this operation was to capture the oilfields and guard the flanks of advances into Malaya and the NEI. Japanese troops landed at Sarawak on 16 December 1941, where a single battalion of British Indian troops fought a delaying action over several weeks, damaging vital oil installations. Meanwhile, on 11 January 1942, Japanese troops landed on the island of Tarakan, while parachute troops carried out a drop on the Celebes the following day; the small Dutch garrison managed to destroy some of the infrastructure before eventually being overwhelmed. The destruction of these facilities led to harsh reprisals against civilians, particularly at Balikpapan where between 80 and 100 Europeans were executed. In the aftermath, the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) administered the occupied British North Borneo and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was responsible for Dutch Borneo. The garrison forces on the island were very small until mid-1944. During the occupation, the local population was subjected to harsh treatment. For example, on Tarakan large numbers of people were conscripted as labourers, the economy was disrupted, and food became increasingly scarce. In late October 1943, an open revolt by local Dayak tribesmen and ethnic Chinese began which was violently suppressed with hundreds being executed. In the aftermath, many more died from diseases and starvation as Japanese policies became even more restrictive on the local population. Japanese forces conducted a number of other massacres during their occupation of Borneo. Planning A map showing the progress of the Borneo campaign The plans for the Allied attacks were known collectively as Operation Oboe. The invasion of Borneo was the second stage of Operation Montclair, which was aimed at destroying Imperial Japanese forces in, and re-occupying the NEI, Raj of Sarawak, Brunei, the colonies of Labuan and British North Borneo, and the southern Philippines. Borneo in particular was considered at the time a strategic location for its natural resource; oil and rubber. Tarakan was also seen to offer a forward airbase to support future operations in the region, while Brunei Bay was intended to be used as naval base. Planning for the operation began in late 1944 and early 1945 through the General Headquarters of General Douglas MacArthur's South West Pacific Area. As a result of the commitment of US forces to the recapture of the Philippines, the task of recapturing Borneo was allocated primarily to Australian ground forces. By this time the Australian I Corps, the Australian Army's main striking force, had not engaged in combat for over a year. The corps had been assigned to MacArthur, but he had chosen to not use it in the Philippines despite the Australian Government pressing for this. The initial Allied plan comprised six stages: Operation Oboe 1 was to be an attack on Tarakan; Oboe 2 against Balikpapan; Oboe 3 against Banjarmasin; Oboe 4 against Surabaya or the capital of the NEI, Batavia (modern-day Jakarta); Oboe 5 against the eastern NEI; and Oboe 6 against British North Borneo (Sabah). In the end only the operations against Tarakan, Balikpapan and British North Borneo ‚Äì at Labuan and Brunei Bay ‚Äì took place. These operations ultimately constituted the last campaigns of Australian forces in the war against Japan. In the planning phase the commander of the Australian Military Forces, General Thomas Blamey recommended against the landing at Balikpapan, believing that it would serve no strategic purpose. After much consideration, the Australian Government agreed to provide forces for this operation at MacArthur's urging. Blamey was able to frustrate MacArthur's plans for Australian troops to make follow-on landings in Java by convincing Prime Minister John Curtin to withhold the 6th Division. Prior to the main landings in British North Borneo the Allies undertook a series of reconnaissance operations, codenamed Agas (northern Borneo) and Semut (Sarawak); these operations also worked to arm, train and organise the local population to undertake guerilla warfare against the Japanese to support conventional operations. The Japanese military began to prepare for the defence of Borneo from mid-1944, as Allied forces rapidly advanced towards the island. IJA reinforcements were allocated to Borneo, but did not arrive until between September and November that year. In late 1944 the Japanese command judged that Australian forces were likely to attack the Brunei area and then capture the west coast of Borneo as part of a campaign aimed at liberating Singapore. Accordingly, most of the IJA units in north- eastern Borneo were ordered to move overland to the west coast; this required them to undertake gruelling marches over rugged terrain. Two other battalions were transferred from north-eastern Borneo by sea to south Borneo between February and March 1945. After United States forces liberated key areas of the Philippines, which cut the rest of South-East Asia off from Japan, on 27 January 1945 the IJA's General Staff ordered the forces in this area to defend the territory they held and not expect reinforcements. Opposing forces US Navy Landing Craft Infantry crowded with Australian soldiers prior to the landing at Labuan The main Allied ground forces assigned to the campaign came from the Australian I Corps, under Lieutenant-General Leslie Morshead. The main elements of this force consisted of two infantry divisions: the 7th and 9th. For the operation, the Australian corps was assigned as a task force directly under MacArthur's command rather than as part of the Eighth Army, which was controlling operations in the Philippines. Allied naval and air forces, centred on the U.S. 7th Fleet under Admiral Thomas Kinkaid, the Australian First Tactical Air Force, and the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force also played important roles in the campaign. A small number of Dutch personnel also took part in the operations. Over 74,000 Allied troops were assigned to the initial landings of the campaign. The bulk of the logistic support was provided by the US, particularly provision of the shipping that was required to transport the vast amounts of troops, stores and equipment required for the operation. Allied forces were resisted by IJN and IJA forces in southern and eastern Borneo, under Vice-Admiral Michiaki Kamada, and in the north-west by the Thirty-Seventh Army, led by Lieutenant-General Masao Baba, which was headquartered in Jesselton. The main elements of the Thirty-Seventh Army were the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade (northern Borneo), 71st Independent Mixed Brigade (southern Borneo) and 25th Independent Mixed Regiment; these units had been raised in Japan during the second half of 1944 and arrived in Borneo late that year. The IJN's 2nd Naval Guard Force was also stationed in Borneo. Allied intelligence assessed that there were about 32,000 Japanese troops in Borneo, with 15,000 of these being combat troops. Most of the units which had been ordered from north-eastern Borneo to the west coast were still in transit when the Australian landings began and had been greatly weakened by the difficult conditions experienced during their cross-island march. The transfers left only single battalions in place at Tarakan and Balikpapan. Japanese air power in the region, except in Java and Sumatra, was ineffective. Battles =Tarakan= Matilda tank in the interior of Tarakan The campaign opened with Oboe 1, which consisted of a landing on the small island of Tarakan, off the north-east coast on 1 May 1945. This operation was undertaken to capture the island's airstrip so that it could be used to support the subsequent landings on the mainland of Borneo. Using Australian- built MK III folboats, small parties of reconnaissance troops paddled into the Tarakan region to obtain useful information and observe the Djoeta oilfields prior to an invasion. The landing on Tarakan was assigned to the heavily reinforced 26th Brigade, under the command of Brigadier David Whitehead. This brigade's three infantry battalions were augmented with two battalions of pioneers as well as commandos and engineers. American amphibious engineers and a Dutch infantry company (made up of soldiers from Ambon Island) and civil affairs unit were also placed under Whitehead's command. Overall, the 26th Brigade had a strength of just under 12,000 troops. The Australian assault was preceded by a heavy aerial bombardment commencing 12 April, and undertaken by RAAF and US aircraft operating from Morotai Island and the Philippines; these aircraft interdicted Japanese shipping, attacked airfields, reduced obstacles around the landing beaches and suppressed artillery and defensive positions; in addition, a preliminary landing was undertaken on Sadau Island by a group of commandos and an artillery battery. Naval assets assigned to provide fire support during the operation include three cruisers, seven destroyers and several landing craft fitted with rockets and mortars. Three days prior to the assault, a force of minesweepers worked to clear the area of naval mines. During the main landing, the battery on Sadau Island provided fire support to the Australian engineers who were landed at Lingkas to clear obstacles on the landing beaches. Assault troops from the 2/23rd and 2/48th Infantry Battalions came ashore under the cover of a strong naval barrage. Initially, they encountered no opposition before they began to advance north towards Tarakan town. Opposition around Lingkas Hill was overcome and by the end of the first day a strong beachhead had been established. The brigade reserve, the 2/24th Infantry Battalion, was landed the next day as the advance towards the airfield continued. Japanese resistance grew, and the advance was hindered by large numbers of mines and booby traps, which had to be cleared by engineers and pioneers; however, finally, on 5 May the airfield was captured by the Australians. Meanwhile, operations continued into June as isolated pockets of Japanese resisted the Australians in tunnels and on high features across the island. The final major objective, Hill 90, was secured on 20 June, but small scale clashes continued after this. Ultimately, the airfield was so heavily damaged that it took eight weeks to repair, by which time the war was essentially over. As a result, most historians, including the Australian official historian Gavin Long, believe that the invasion of Tarakan did not justify the casualties suffered by the Allied forces; these included 225 Australians killed and 669 wounded. Japanese casualties were even heavier, with 1,540 being killed and 252 captured. =North Borneo= The landings in north-west Borneo had several goals. These included securing the Brunei Bay area for use as a naval base and capturing oil and rubber facilities. A total of 29,000 personnel were assigned to the operation, just over 1,000 of these were US and British personnel, while the rest were Australian. Almost 6,000 were air force personnel, while 18,000 were ground troops and 4,700 were base area personnel. Major General George Wootten's 9th Division was the main element of this force, and consisted of two infantry brigades ‚Äì the 20th and 24th; the division's third brigade ‚Äì the 26th Brigade ‚Äì had been detached for operations on Tarakan. The troops were supported by large number of American and Australian warships and air units. In preparation for the landing, a reconnaissance party including Sergeant Jack Wong Sue, was inserted into Kimanis Bay, British North Borneo, for close reconnaissance work using a Hoehn military folboat deployed from a Catalina aircraft. LST at Labuan on 10 June 1945 Oboe 6 began on 10 June with simultaneous assaults by the 24th Brigade on the island of Labuan and the 20th Brigade on the coast of Brunei in the north-west of Borneo. As Japanese forces were holding positions away from the coast, these landings were unopposed. The 20th Brigade encountered little resistance. After the town of Brunei was secured on 13 June, the brigade continued its advance along the coast towards the south-west. Its objective was the Miri‚ÄìLutong area, with the 2/17th Battalion moving by land while the 2/13th Battalion made an amphibious landing at Lutong on 20 June. The Japanese forces withdrew as the Australians advanced, and there was little fighting during these operations. Patrols into the interior made by the 20th Brigade with the assistance of local Dayaks into the interior were involved in several sharp engagements. While the 24th Brigade rapidly captured Labuan's airfield and town, it encountered sustained resistance from the Japanese garrison which was located in a well-defended stronghold. After heavy casualties were sustained during the 2/28th Battalion's initial attack against this position on 16 June it was decided to subject the area to a sustained bombardment. The battalion attacked again on 21 June with the support of tanks and rapidly defeated the Japanese forces. The fighting on Labuan cost the 24th Brigade 34 killed and 93 wounded. The Australian soldiers counted 389 Japanese dead and took 11 prisoners. A week after the initial landing on Labuan, the Australians followed up with attacks on Japanese positions around Weston on the north- eastern part of Brunei Bay. The Australians then pushed inland along the single track railway that ran from Weston towards the junction at Beaufort, north-west of Brunei Bay, and then on to Jesselton. The heaviest fighting of the operations on the mainland took place on 27/28 June during the Battle of Beaufort, during which more than 100 Japanese defenders were killed. After this engagement the 24th Brigade undertook limited further advances in order to push the Japanese forces into the hills; the brigade's limit of exploitation was the Beaufort‚ÄìTenom railway and during this period the Australian commanders adopted a cautious approach to limit casualties. Nevertheless, clashes continued into August; on 3 August, the Japanese attempted to counterattack a position held by the 2/28th Battalion. At least 11 Japanese were killed in the fighting, for the loss of one Australian. The operations in North Borneo also involved a substantial civil affairs effort to assist the liberated civilian population; this was the largest such task undertaken by Australian forces during World War II. The 9th Division was heavily involved in providing aid to civilians and rebuilding houses and infrastructure which had been destroyed by the pre-invasion bombardments and subsequent fighting. =Guerilla warfare= Dayak men armed with Japanese rifles in Brunei during June 1945 before returning to their villages in the interior The conventional operations on British North Borneo were accompanied by a guerilla warfare campaign organised by Special Operations Australia (SOA). This involved two operations; Operation Agas in British North Borneo and Operation Semut in Sarawak. These operations succeeded the unsuccessful Operation Python which had been undertaken between October 1943 and January 1944. Five SOA parties were inserted in North Borneo between March and July 1945. The Agas 1 and 2 parties established networks of agents and guerrillas in north-western Borneo. The Agas 4 and 5 parties were landed on the east coast of Borneo, and achieved little. The Agas 3 party investigated the Ranau area on the request of I Corps. The results of Operation Agas were mixed; its parties established control over their areas of operation, provided intelligence of variable quality and killed less than 100 Japanese. As part of Operation Semut over 100 Allied personnel organised into four parties were inserted by air into Sarawak from March 1945. Most of these personnel were Australian. The Semut parties were tasked with collecting intelligence and establishing guerilla forces. The inhabitants of Sarawak's interior, who were known as Dayaks, enthusiastically joined the guerilla groups and SOA personnel led small private armies. No. 200 Flight RAAF and the Royal Australian Navy's Snake-class junks played important roles in this campaign by inserting SOA personnel and supplies. The guerilla forces launched attacks to gain control of the interior of Sarawak while the 9th Division focused on the coastal area, the oilfields, plantations and the ports in North Borneo. The guerillas operated from patrol bases around Balai, Ridan and Marudi, as well as in the mountains, along several key waterways including the Pandaruan and Limbang Rivers, and along the railway that ran between Beaufort and Tenom. They sought to disrupt the Japanese troops' freedom of movement and interdicted forces as they withdrew from the main combat zone. The RAAF flew air strikes to support the lightly armed guerillas, who at times had to evade better-armed Japanese units. The campaign was highly successful, and it is estimated that over 1,800 Japanese were killed in north Borneo through guerilla actions. =Balikpapan= The attention of the Allies then switched back to the central east coast, with Oboe 2. The last major amphibious assault of World War II was at Balikpapan on 1 July 1945. The landing was preceded by a heavy aerial bombardment over the course of 20 days, while minesweepers worked to clear the area for 15 days, establishing safe lanes for the invasion fleet to pass and clearing proposed anchorages. These operations were undertaken inside the range of Japanese coastal guns; to protect the minesweepers, naval gunfire and aerial bombardment was used to suppress and neutralise the Japanese guns. Due to the unavailability of the Tarakan airfield, air support for the operation was provided by RAAF and US units based in the southern Philippines. Three minesweepers were lost during the clearance operations. Members of the 7th Division at Balikpapan The invasion fleet sailed from Morotai Island on 26 June, arriving off Balikpapan on 29 June. The landing area was then subjected to over 45,000 rounds of preparatory fire from the Australian, US and Dutch warships supporting the landing. A deception plan was enacted to draw Japanese attention towards Manggar, with the Australians undertaking pre-landing operations and spreading disinformation. US underwater demolition teams cleared obstacles along the landing beach, as well as off Manggar, as part of the deception plan. For the landing operation, a total of 33,000 personnel were assigned, 21,000 of which were from the Australian 7th Division, under the command of Major General Edward Milford. This formation consisted of three brigades ‚Äì the 18th, 21st and 25th ‚Äì fighting together as a formation for the first time during the war. Three beaches were chosen for the landing on the southern coast between Klandasan in the east and Stalkoedo in the west; the initial assault was undertaken by three infantry battalions: the 2/10th on the extreme left, the 2/12th in the centre and the 2/27th Battalion on the right. The troops were landed at the wrong location as smoke from the pre-landing bombardment made navigation difficult, but the landing was unopposed and a beachhead was quickly established as follow on forces arrived. Operating on the left, the 18th Brigade fought to capture several high features around Klandasan and to gain control of the town and secure the harbour and port facilities in Balikpapan north-west of the landing beaches, while the 21st Brigade landed on the right, tasked with advancing east towards several Japanese airfields at Sepinggang and Manggar, along the main coastal road. The 25th Brigade was held in reserve, but after landing on 2 July, pushed inland towards Batuchampar, from the initial landing site. Balikpapan town and the port were captured on 3 July, but mopping up continued into 4 July. Along the coast, the 21st Brigade crossed the Batakan Ketjil River, where it was held up on 3 July by strong Japanese resistance, which was overcome with naval gunfire support. The following day, after crossing the Manggar Besar, the brigade came up against even stronger Japanese opposition, supported by coastal artillery and mortars defending the airfield; despite landing tanks around the river, the Australians were held up for several more days until some of the guns were captured, and heavy air strikes overwhelmed the defenders. Meanwhile, on 5 July, one of the 18th Brigade's infantry battalions ‚Äì the 2/9th ‚Äì along with the 2/1st Pioneer Battalion, was landed at Panadjam to clear the western shore of Japanese artillery, prior to the Allies opening the port. Against only limited opposition, the area around Panadjam was cleared within two days. Meanwhile, the airfields were secured by 9 July, but Japanese resistance was strong, utilising delaying tactics including booby traps, mines, sniping and small-scale raids. Strong resistance was met around Batuchampar where a Japanese battalion had established a stronghold, while others fought resolutely in tunnels around Manggar. Australian engineers were heavily tasked, working to clear over 8,000 mines and booby traps, as well as destroying over 100 tunnels. Once Manggar airfield was secured, the 21st Brigade continued their advance towards Sambodja. Moving inland along a north- east road dubbed the \\"Milford Highway\\" by the Australians, the 25th Brigade advanced to contact with the Japanese rearguard, which was reduced with artillery support and then outflanked, triggering a withdrawal to a secondary position back on 9 July. Air strikes and artillery helped reduce this position, while infantry worked to surround the position; this was not fully achieved and by the evening of 21/22 July, the remaining defenders withdrew further inland. Opposition in these areas was largely overcome by the end of July, but mopping-up operations around Balikpapan continued until the end of the war in August as Japanese troops withdrew to the rough high ground further inland. Operations to secure Balikpapan cost the Australians 229 killed and 634 wounded, while Japanese losses were placed at 2,032 killed. A further 63 were captured. Aftermath Part of the Labuan War Cemetery in 2011 In the aftermath of the campaign, Australian personnel remained in Borneo until late 1945 to restore civilian administration, oversee reconstruction efforts, supervising the surrender of Japanese troops, and liberating former Allied prisoners of war held in camps around Borneo. It has been claimed that Australian forces near Beaufort encouraged local fighters to massacre surrendered Japanese troops after the war in revenge for the Sandakan Death Marches, with almost 6,000 Japanese being killed. The historian Ooi Keat Gin states though that no documentary evidence supports these claims. The amphibious operations undertaken by Australian forces throughout the Borneo campaign were, according to the historian Eustace Keogh the \\"outstanding feature\\" of the campaign, and represented the largest such operations that the Australians undertook during the war. They required vast amounts of naval and air support, as well as complex planning and co-operation between air, land and naval forces from several nations. A significant amount of time and resources were invested prior to the operation to train the forces assigned. The historian Peter Dennis assesses that the operations were of \\"doubtful value strategically...[but]...they were skillfully conducted\\". Casualties during the campaign on the Allied side amounted to about 2,100, while the Japanese suffered about 4,700 casualties. A considerable number of civilians were killed or wounded; for instance, the pre-invasion bombardment of Tarakan resulted in least 100 civilian casualties. Despite the success of the Allied landings, because of the strategic situation, the Borneo campaign was criticised in Australia at the time and in subsequent years, as pointless or a \\"waste\\" of the lives of soldiers, especially following the first operation in Tarakan. In assessing the necessity of the campaign, historians such as Max Hastings have said that attacking these forces, already cut off from Japan, was a waste of resources. According to Hastings, \\"Any rational strategic judgment would have left them to their own devices screened by token allied forces until their nation's defeat enforced their surrender\\". It has been argued that the campaign did, however, achieve a number of objectives, such as increasing the isolation of significant Japanese forces occupying the main part of the NEI, capturing major oil supplies, and freeing Allied prisoners of war, who were being held in increasingly worse conditions in the Sandakan camp and Batu Lintang camp.

Scirpus acutus, Schoenoplectus lacustris, Scirpus lacustris subsp. acutus), called tule , common tule, hardstem tule, tule rush, hardstem bulrush, or viscid bulrush, is a giant species of sedge in the plant family Cyperaceae, native to freshwater marshes all over North America.P.A. Munz, 1973 The common name derives from the NƒÅhuatl word t≈çllin , and was first applied by the early settlers from New Spain who recognized the marsh plants in the Central Valley of California as similar to those in the marshes around Mexico City. Tules once lined the shores of Tulare Lake, California, formerly the largest freshwater lake in the western United States. It was drained by land speculators in the 20th century. The expression \\"out in the tules\\" is still common, deriving from the dialect of old Californian families and means \\"where no one would want to live\\", with a touch of irony. The phrase is comparable to \\"out in the boondocks\\".\\"Out in the Tules: The Freshwater Marsh of Coyote Hills\\", by Joe Eaton, in Bay Nature, Jan-Mar 2004 Schoenoplectus acutus has a thick, rounded green stem growing to tall, with long, grasslike leaves, and radially symmetrical, clustered, pale brownish flowers. Tules at shorelines play an important ecological role, helping to buffer against wind and water forces, thereby allowing the establishment of other types of plants and reducing erosion. Tules are sometimes cleared from waterways using herbicides. When erosion occurs, tule rhizomes are replanted in strategic areas. The two varieties are: *Schoenoplectus acutus var. acutus ‚Äì northern and eastern North America *Schoenoplectus acutus var. occidentalis ‚Äì southwestern North America History and culture Schoenoplectus acutus at the Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge Dyed and woven, tules are used to make baskets, bowls, mats, hats, clothing, duck decoys, and even boats by Native American groups. Before the Salish got horses for bison hunting, they lived in tents covered with sewed mats of tule.Teit, James A. (1930): The Salishan Tribes of the Western Plateaus. Smithsonian Institution. 45th Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology. Washington, p. 332. At least two tribes, the Wanapum and the Pomo people, constructed tule houses as recently as the 1950s and still do for special occasions. Bay Miwok, Coast Miwok, and Ohlone peoples used the tule in the manufacture of canoes or balsas, for transportation across the San Francisco Bay and using the marine and wetland resources.Klar & Jones, 2007 Northern groups of Chumash used the tule in the manufacture of canoes rather than the sewn-plank tomol usually used by Chumash and used them to gather marine harvests.C.M. Hogan, 2008 The Paiutes named a neighboring tribe the Si-Te-Cah in their language, meaning tule eaters. The young sprouts and shoots can be eaten raw and the rhizomes and unripe flower heads can be boiled as vegetables. One of the few Pomo survivors of the Bloody Island Massacre (also called the Clear Lake Massacre) in Northern California, a 6-year-old girl named Ni'ka, or Lucy Moore, evaded the United States Cavalry by hiding behind the tule reeds in the bloodied water.https://newsmaven.io/indiancountrytoday/archive/pomo-indians- remember-1850-bloody-island-massacre-with-events- may-18-19-tlH7xF2Nq0SbN3K596ndfg/ Her descendants have since formed the Lucy Moore Foundation to work for better relations between the Pomo and residents of California. It is so common in wetlands in California, several places in the state were named for it, including Tulare (a tulare is a tule marsh). Tule Lake is near the Oregon border and includes Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge. It was the site of an internment camp for Japanese Americans during World War II, imprisoning 18,700 people at its peak. The town of Tulelake is northeast of the lake. California also has a Tule River. The Tule Desert is located in Arizona and Nevada. Nevada also has Tule Springs. California's dense, ground-hugging tule fog is named for the plant, as are the tule elk and tule perch. The giant garter snake (Thamnophis gigas) was historically closely associated with tule marshes in California's Central Valley. Notes References * Munz, Philip A. A California Flora.

He is best known as the drummer of Mayhem, which he joined in 1988. In 1987 Blomberg formed the avant-garde black metal band Arcturus (under the name Mortem) with Steinar Sverd Johnsen, which broke up in April 2007 and reunited in 2011. He named himself after the Swiss extreme metal band Hellhammer. Praised as a talented musician, Blomberg is a three-time winner of the Spellemannprisen award. Biography =Early life= Hellhammer, 2008 As a child Blomberg's main interests were football (soccer) and wrestling. At first he had no interest in drums or drumming, but as music became more appealing to him he started to find the different instruments interesting, which eventually led to an interest in drums. His grandparents purchased him his first three drum kits; the first one was a four-piece jazz kit. With these he began learning how to play drums by playing along with albums he listened to. He was into heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Metallica and Slayer, but also bands like Depeche Mode and Duran Duran. He then found out about Venom and Celtic Frost and eventually jazz, due to influences from a past drum teacher. =Music career= Before joining Mayhem, Jan Axel Blomberg played in various local bands, including the progressive metal band Tritonus, where he met Carl August Tidemann, the man who became the Arcturus and Winds guitarist. He did some live performances as well, and then was hired by Mayhem, who needed to replace Kjetil Manheim; Blomberg got the job and took the pseudonym Hellhammer. The first recordings he did with Mayhem were two songs for a compilation album around 1989, with the songs Carnage and The Freezing Moon. The first proper recording he did with Mayhem was Live in Leipzig in 1990. After that album, Mayhem had some trouble with the line up due to the suicide of the singer Dead and Necrobutcher's departure from the band. During this time he founded the band Arcturus together with Sverd in 1991, out of the remains of the band Mortem. They released the 7\\" My Angel in 1991 and later the mini album Constellation. In 1995 he joined Immortal as a session drummer during their tour that year,MEMBERS. he also agreed to play drums on their first official Video, Grim and Frostbitten Kingdoms. He also briefly played for Emperor during this period. The recording and release of the Arcturus debut album Aspera Hiems Symfonia also happened this year. In 1997 Jan Axel began working with Covenant, now known as The Kovenant, for the recording of their second album, Nexus Polaris. That album was released in 1998 with a following European tour. During 1997 Arcturus also released another album, La Masquerade Infernale. The next year another album from The Kovenant was released, Animatronic. During the year 2000 he recorded a mini album with his new band Winds, Of Entity And Mind, which was released in May 2001. Winds also recorded a full-length album during spring 2001, Reflections of the I. Jan Axel is now a two-time Norwegian Grammy Awards winner, in 1998 for The Kovenant with Nexus Polaris and in 1999 for The Kovenant with Animatronic. They claimed the prize for best hard rock album both years. In addition to these mentioned involvements, Jan Axel has also done numerous appearances as a guest or session musician on other releases. In 2005, he was interviewed for the black metal mini-documentary that was included with the 2-disc DVD edition of Metal: A Headbanger's Journey, in addition to other Mayhem members Necrobutcher (J√∏rn Stubberud) and Blasphemer (Rune Eriksen). In 2009, Hellhammer appeared on Eyes of Noctum's album Inceptum, where he played drums on six tracks. Eyes of Noctum are a black metal band from America featuring Weston Cage, son of Nicolas Cage as their lead singer. Hellhammer played with keyboardist Andy Winter on one of his albums.Mayhem's Hellhammer Completes Drum Recordings For New Andy Winter Project blabbermouth.net. November 6, 2007. Retrieved on January 10, 2012. Also in 2010, Hellhammer played on Nidingr's album Wolf-Father. In 2011 Arcturus reunited, Hellhammer included, and released Arcturian in 2015. Controversy He has courted controversy in the past by making numerous racist comments and advocating violence against homosexuals. The black metal biography Lords of Chaos quotes him as saying, \\"I'll put it this way, we don't like black people here. Black metal is for white people.... I'm pretty convinced that there are differences between races as well as everything else. I think that like animals, some races are more ... you know, like a cat is much more intelligent than a bird or a cow, or even a dog, and I think that's also the case with different races.\\"Michael Moynihan and Didrik S√∏derlind, Lords of Chaos: the bloody rise of the Satanic metal underground (Feral House, 1998), page 305. Blomberg said in a 2004 interview, \\"I don't give a crap if the fans are white, black, green, yellow, or blue.

The battle also reshaped the settlement patterns of the Atlantic region, and laid the groundwork for the modern province of New Brunswick. Beginning June 3, 1755, a British army under Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Monckton staged out of nearby Fort Lawrence, besieged the small French garrison at Fort Beaus√©jour with the goal of opening the Isthmus of Chignecto to British control. Control of the isthmus was crucial to the French because it was the only gateway between Quebec and Louisbourg during the winter months. After two weeks of siege, Louis Du Pont Duchambon de Vergor, the fort's commander, capitulated on June 16.  Historical context  Tensions between the English and the French concerning the Acadian territory date to the seventeenth century, when France established its Acadian colony, which made them neighbors with the Puritans in New England. One of the main reasons for tensions was the question of jurisdiction, especially after the conquest of Acadia (1710). The isthmus of Chignecto was claimed by both the French and English whereas present day Nova Scotia was claimed by the English. The border differentiating the two was the Missaguash River; however, Acadians settled on both sides of the river. English claim to present day New Brunswick, and Northern Maine conflicted with small French presence and Acadian settlement in the area. Despite this, France's Louis XV encouraged Acadians to migrate to the land west of the Missaguash, and toward Fort Beaus√©jour. In the 1750s, New Englanders were subject to drought, depression, high taxes and violence, all of which were further manipulated by Puritan and Protestant priests to garner support for an impending attack on the Catholic French. Furthermore, the close relationship between the French and the Mikmaq in the area angered the English. Acadians often married the Mikmaq people, leading to an ethnic accord and the creation of a unique local population. The English especially resented the Acadians for holding the best land and for the support they had from the Mikmaq, which prevented the establishment of a Protestant settlement. A major problem for the New Englanders was the close relationship between the Acadians, the French, and the Mikmaq. Abb√© Le Loutre, the priest at Fort Beaus√©jour, created yet another source of tension as he was a representative of the French government, and therefore also allied to the Mikmaq. Le Loutre was loyal to France and to ensure the Acadians' allegiance, he threatened physical and spiritual damage to the Acadians if they were ever to enter English territory. In the face of religious and military excommunication, Acadians subdued any English support they may have had. Le Loutre also encouraged the Mikmaq to continue to align themselves against the British which they had done since King William's War (1689). The British put a bounty on Le Loutre. Lieutenant- Colonel Lawrence and the Nova Scotia Council, along with many previous governors, had noted that on many occasions, the Acadians did not act neutral. Lawrence had evidence that at least some Acadians clearly favoured the French and hoped to force all of the Acadians to take an oath of allegiance to the English. The English in New England considered the Acadians traitors to Britain and as \\"French bigots\\", whom they hoped would be moved to Philadelphia. Lawrence had little regard for the unique lifestyle of the Acadians and their declaration of neutrality. Consequently, some historians have suggested the Lawrence was motivated by wanting to clear rich land for New Englanders. Others have noted that the deportation was primarily based on military reasons to remove any military threat Acadians posed in their alliance with the Mi'kmaq people and the Acadian support of Louisbourg. In 1753, French troops from Canada marched south and seized and fortified the Ohio Valley. Britain protested the invasion and claimed Ohio for itself. On May 28, 1754, the French and Indian War began with the Battle of Jumonville Glen. French Officer Ensign de Jumonville and a third of his escort was killed by a British patrol led by George Washington. In retaliation the French and the Indians defeated the British at Fort Necessity. Washington lost a third of his force, and surrendered. In Acadia, the primary British objective was to defeat the French fortifications at Beausejour and Louisbourg. The British saw the Acadians' allegiance to the French and the Wabanaki Confederacy as a military threat. Father Le Loutre's War had created the conditions for total war; British civilians had not been spared and, as Governor Charles Lawrence and the Nova Scotia Council saw it, Acadian civilians had provided intelligence, sanctuary, and logistical support while others had fought against the British. Throughout all of this, the British were nervous about a French and native invasion. As a result of native raids supported by the French some British settlers left their settlements (see Raid on Dartmouth (1751)). As a result of the military buildup at Chignecto, as part of the larger coordinated effort of the French and Indian War, the Governor of Massachusetts, William Shirley planned to take Fort Beausejour. Shirley's intelligence fermented the idea that the only way of saving Massachusetts was to attack Beaus√©jour.  Fort Beaus√©jour: construction and espionage  Map of Chignecto (1755) In 1750, the Governor of New France Jacques-Pierre de la Jonqui√®re heard that the English were building a fort in the region of Acadia. This fort later became Fort Lawrence. In response, the French decided to build Fort Beaus√©jour. The building of the fort began in 1751 and the plans created by a military engineer named Jacau de Fiedmont, who became a lieutenant in 1752. Fiedmont was responsible for the construction of the fort as well as for the plans of its defence. The fort was supposed to be strong enough to withstand bombardment, but Fort Beaus√©jour was not completely finished in 1755, for multiple reasons. To begin with, the fort's priest Abb√© Le Loutre decided to reallocate manpower to an irrigation project. Also, Louis du Chambon de Vergor, the military commander at Fort Beaus√©jour in 1754, was more concerned with keeping the money for himself and was therefore not putting the resources to use strengthening the defences of Fort Beaus√©jour. Jacau de Fiedmont's journal, The Siege of Beaus√©jour in 1755: A Journal of the Attack on Beaus√©jour, puts emphasis on the point that if the fortifications would have been completed by the beginning of the siege, the Fort would have had higher resistance against bombardment which would have increased the morale of the French and Acadian defenders. Fiedmont continually insisted on working on the defences because of the fort's weaknesses, yet this work was never completed. Charles Morris (inset of A chart of the sea coasts of the peninsula of Nova Scotia, 1755) Another important figure at Fort Beaus√©jour at this time was Thomas Pichon, who having originally studied medicine in France, was the Commander's secretary at Fort Beaus√©jour. When Fort Beaus√©jour was affected by an epidemic of food poisoning, Pichon traveled to Fort Lawrence to discuss his medical notes with the English surgeon. The conclusion was that a poisonous herb was being used in food, instead of the parsley the French thought they were using. From this, Pichon became friendly and on good terms with the English at Fort Lawrence, visiting the fort regularly as he felt that people did not recognize his value at Fort Beaus√©jour. Pichon did not trust either Commander Vergor or the priest Abb√© Le Loutre who, while underneath Vergor in the hierarchy, was the real figure in charge. Pichon eventually met the commander at Fort Lawrence, Captain George Scott, and was hired as a spy. Pichon stated that he agreed to become a spy because he believed that the British nation was superior to the French nation, but it is more likely that he wanted monetary gain and despised his superiors at Fort Beaus√©jour. For a year preceding the Siege of Beaus√©jour, Pichon gave crucial military information such as maps and battle plans to the English. (Some Acadians also worked as spies for the British.Letter from Loudon to Fox. 1757, p. 702) After the events of 1755, Thomas Pichon began his new life as Thomas Tyrell, a subject of King George II. Later in his life Pichon came to regret his treason against the French.  The siege  thumbright350px View of Fort Beausejour showing the foundation of the Officers Quarters in the foreground, the modern (1930s) museum in the middle ground, and Cumberland Basin in the background. Monckton approached the fort from Aulac Ridge, which would be behind the observer. Recruitment for an attack on Beaus√©jour was done by Colonel Shirley of Massachusetts. He was able to gather 2000 men, who would be led by Colonel Winslow, Lieutenant-Colonel George Scott, and Robert Monckton. The expedition left Boston on May 22, 1755, and arrived at Fort Lawrence on June 2, where an additional 400 men joined the expedition. The English expedition then started moving towards Fort Beaus√©jour on June 4. In the meantime, Vergor received news of the impending attack, and started to put defence measures into place. He first issued a call to arms to the surrounding Acadian population, who answered it begrudgingly. The Acadians asked their governor to threaten them, in order to be protected from execution for treason from the English. Fort Beaus√©jour had a maximum of a thousand men to defend it. At the same time, Vergor sent letters to Qu√©bec, Louisbourg, as well as settlements on the St. John river and on the Islands of St. John for help. He also sent a letter to Fort Gaspereau, which was located the closest to Fort Beaus√©jour. While Vergor was technically in charge of the fort, it was Jacau de Fiedmont who coordinated all of the defence plans and preparations for the attack. He was well aware that the only way Beaus√©jour would survive the siege would be by strengthening its defences. He was therefore insistent that the extra work be done before the English arrived. Other preparations included destroying roads and bridges. The first confrontation between the French settlers and soldiers of Fort Beaus√©jour and the English took place on June 4 at the Missaguash River. A total of 400 French, Acadian, and Indian men, faced off against British soldiers in battle formation. It was clear from the start that the Acadians were not good fighters and lacked fighting spirit and motivation, which would have given the English a strong sense of Fort Beaus√©jour's weaknesses, lack of ability, and deficiency of courage. After the confrontation, it was said that the English suffered a loss of eighty men, but this was most likely a fabricated number to boost the already low morale of the Acadians, as their aim was bad. The English started rebuilding the bridge over the Missaguash River which Vergor had destroyed under fire, and suffered no casualties. The night of June 4, Vergor continued to put into place defence mechanisms, this time setting all of the surrounding buildings, shops, and homes on fire. This did nothing to improve the worsening morale of the Acadians, as these were their homes. Vergor, Abb√© le Loutre, and Fiedmont were doing anything they could to improve the morale of the Acadians and of the soldiers. Vergor emphasizes the coming help from Louisbourg. Fiedmont also worried about the level of motivation of the Acadians, as he desperately needed them to work in order to continue to fortify the defenses. The few men he found who were willing to work were not nearly enough. Fort Beausejour and St. Louis Catholic Church (c.1755) On June 7 and 8, Native allies of the French had captured an English officer called Hay, and brought him to Fort Beaus√©jour as a prisoner, as well as an English deserter. The English officer made clear to the officers at Fort Beaus√©jour that the English had a very strong force and heavy artillery. On June 9, intense rain gave the Acadians yet another perfect excuse not to work on strengthening the defences, but no such excuse was used by the English, who continued to build their trenches and prepare to start the siege. On June 11, Fiedmont tried again to motivate the Acadians to finish the defences but no to avail. On June 12, an officer by the name of Vannes left with 180 men to attack Lieutenant Colonel Scott, but came back later that night without ever having fired a single shot. The entire situation definitely did not help raise the morale of his fellow officers and soldiers. The English started bombing Beaus√©jour on the June 13, with artillery that was much stronger than anything Beaus√©jour had. The men at Fort Beaus√©jour were rapidly losing what little morale they had left, and many Acadians were simply deserting. On the June 14, Vergor received news that the port of Louisbourg was being blocked by the English, and could therefore not send help. As the general morale was already at its ultimate low, Vergor decided to keep this news secret. However, his valet, with whose wife Vergor was having an affair, overheard and spread the news. The next day, all of the Acadians and soldiers had completely lost any hope and morale they may have had left, and started pushing for capitulation. In fact, upon hearing this news, eighty men deserted Beaus√©jour. Desertion was quickly becoming such a problem that orders had to be put in place in order to forbid the men from speaking out about deserting. Thomas Pichon ‚Äì a spy for the British who created the plan of attack used by Monckton Many Acadians who hadn't participated in the fighting were becoming increasingly worried that they would be captured and sentenced to death by the English. Beaus√©jour continued to be bombed until the June 16, when one bomb in particular hit the officer's mess, killing a few French officers as well as the English prisoner Hay, who was the only Englishman to lose his life in the siege. The white flag of surrender was then raised, and the capitulation signed on June 16, 1755. The written capitulation included clauses which protected the Acadians, dictated what the English could take in terms of material goods from Beaus√©jour, and stated that the French could not bear arms in America for the next six months. Fort Beaus√©jour was taken possession by the English at 7:30 p.m. in the evening of June 16. The English offered Fort Gaspereau the same conditions, which were immediately accepted and signed. Immediately after the Battle of Fort Beaus√©jour (1755), Robert Monckton sent a detachment under the command of John Rous to take Fort Menagoueche. De Boishebert knew that he faced a superior force so he burned the fort and retreated up the river to undertake guerrilla warfare. The destruction of Fort Menagoueche left Louisbourg as the last French fort in Acadia. Boishebert made his first strike in the Battle of Petitcodiac.  Aftermath  Winckworth Tonge fought in Battle, Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia) The capture of Fort Beaus√©jour was a deciding factor in relations between the British Empire and the Acadian population of Nova Scotia. For decades Britain had been struggling to extract an oath of allegiance from the Acadians, who maintained that the \\"conventions of 1730\\" had secured their neutrality in all future Anglo-French conflicts. Such refusal, combined with French colonists' repeated attempts to incite rebellion among their fellow French-speakers, left British officials‚Äîespecially Governor Charles Lawrence‚Äîincreasingly wary of an attack from within. Thomas Dixson Grave, Fort Cumberland, New Brunswick The battle of Fort Beaus√©jour sealed the Acadians' fate both militarily and politically. With the fort's capture the French Catholics lost their only overland escape route to the mainland. Having also conceded their guns to Lawrence, the colonials were left \\"at the mercy of their British overlords.\\" The British, meanwhile, discovered that several Acadians had participated in the defense of Beaus√©jour. Lawrence had enough evidence of some Acadians continuing to breach neutrality that he and the Council decided to solve the \\"festering Acadian problem\\" once and for all. On July 31, 1755, he ordered the forcible removal the Acadian population from the colony. Historians have debated the Empire's probable plans for Acadia prior to the taking of Beaus√©jour. By refusing to swear an oath of allegiance, Acadians had long resisted assimilation into a British Protestant mainstream. Lawrence's letters reveal a marked hostility toward the Acadians by 1754, at which point he was planning with Massachusetts Governor William Shirley to draw British battalions into Nova Scotia. As with many previous governors, Lawrence and Shirley had often discussed the possibility of removing the Acadians, but, before 1755, lacked the means for such measures. If not for General Edward Braddock's humiliating defeat that same year, Lawrence might have extended British control well beyond Acadia, eliminating the perceived need for mass deportation. Fort Beaus√©jour was renamed Fort Cumberland by the British. It quickly became a major hub of Acadian expulsion, but saw little military activity during the rest of the Seven Years' War. The fort would face another siege with the 1776 Battle of Fort Cumberland during the American Revolution.

The name is a variation of the Dutch word Pinksteren, meaning \\"Pentecost\\". Pinkster in English almost always refers to the festivals held by African Americans (both free and slave) in the Northeastern United States, particularly in the early 19th century. To the Dutch, Pinkster was a religious holiday, a chance to rest, gather and celebrate religious services like baptisms and confirmations. For their African slaves, Pinkster was a time free from work and a chance to gather and catch up with family and friends. Pentecost is a Christian feast falling on the seventh Sunday after Easter, in remembrance of the descent of the Holy Spirit, in the guise of flames, upon the apostles at the \\"Feast of the Harvest\\" (Ex. 23:16), also known as Whitsunday, enabling the apostles to spread the news of Christ in all languages, (glossolalia or the \\"gift of tongues\\") (Acts 2). ‚ÄûPinksterkrone‚Äú in the Netherlands Pinksteren was also a celebration of the change of the seasons and of spring renewal. Various customs are intended to invoke the growth and fertility of fields and pastures. These include, for example, setting up Pentecost trees (pinksterkrone), that have the same origin as the maypoles. In many places inhabitants decorate village fountains with flowers and birch branches to which they attach colorful ribbons and chains of colored eggs. In North America Dutch colonists and settlers in present-day New York State and New Jersey brought the celebration of Pinkster to North America in the 17th century. However, by the 19th century, Pinkster had evolved into a primarily African-American holiday, celebrated by slaves and free blacks, and liberally seasoned with African culture and traditions. In contrast to the Southern plantations, the great majority of Northern farm families owned few slaves. With the less hospitable climate and less hospitable natives, farms in the north were much smaller; therefore, (except in the larger cities, once they grew) Africans were fewer and farther apart. Family members were sold down the road to other families. Pinkster was a chance for the Africans to meet up and catch up with family and friends, to taste some temporary independence, and a chance to make and spend a little money of their own. It also provided the opportunity to share, express and pass on African culture and tradition, especially to those African Americans born in North America. In New York, families traveled from the outlying areas into New York City or Albany, which remained a largely Dutch city into the early 19th century. There they could meet up with the significantly larger population of slaves and African freemen. By the mid-18th century, celebrations in New York and Brooklyn attracted very large gatherings. African Americans sold berries, herbs, sassafras bark, beverages, and oysters, and they used the money they earned at the Pinkster festival. The celebration of Pinkster Pinkster was celebrated over several days. The Dutch observed Pinkster by attending church services and holding important church functions such as baptisms and confirmations. Neighbors, freed from work, visited with one another while the children painted eggs in vibrant colours and indulged in sweets like gingerbread. Africans and Dutch enjoyed drinking, games, dance and music. Sellers decorated their stalls and carts with greenery and flowers, especially azaleas, which were associated with Pentecost, and Dutch sellers would hire skillful African dancers to attract attention to their stalls. Their dances were combinations of African and European steps and elements, creating new dances that were precursors to modern tap and break dancing. The slaves used the opportunity of Pinkster to take jabs at whites, mimicking and ridiculing, very subtly of course, some of white culture and habits through drama, speeches, storytelling and song. \\"'Pinkster Day' was in Africa a religious day, partly pagan and partly Christian like our Christmas day. Many of the old Colored people, then in Albany, were born in Africa and would dance their wild dances and sing in their native language.\\" In Albany, \\"'Pinkster' festivities took place usually in May, and lasted an entire week. It was‚Ä¶the Carnival of the African Race, in which they indulged in unrestrained merriment and revelry.\\" \\"The dancing music was peculiar. The main instrument was a sort of 'kettle-drum,' a wooden article called an eel-pot, with a sheepskin drawn tightly over one end.\\" =Pinkster King= During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the festival was presided over by a \\"King\\", who was himself a slave. The crowning of the Pinkster King recalled elections of leaders in some African cultures of Northeastern North America, investing respected members of the slave community with symbolic power over the whole community and honor within the slave community. This kind of celebration, inverting rank, recalls West African and European traditions like Boxing Day and Mardi Gras. This tradition has its roots in the Pentecost celebrations in the Kingdom of Kongo under the reign of Afonso I of Kongo. One well-known \\"king\\" in Albany was \\"Charley of Pinkster Hill\\", the \\"King of the Blacks.\\" Charley was born in Angola, said to be of royal blood, and became the servant of Volkert P. Douw, a wealthy merchant. \\"King Charles\\" dressed in the costume of a British Brigadier, a long scarlet coat with gold lace and yellow buckskin accessories, and a three-cornered hat. Charley and his followers, decorated with \\"pinkster blummies\\" (azaleas), led a parade up Albany's State Street. Following the parade \\"the negroes made merry with games and feasting, all paying homage to the king, who was held in awe and reverence as an African prince. In the evening there was a grand dance, led by Charles and some sable beauty.\\" Impact on African-Americans Pinkster as an African-American celebration reached its height in New York between 1790 and 1810. Before the holiday, temporary shelters were built, frequently based on styles imitating African shelters. The festival could continue for three to four days, including sports, dance, and music. The highlight was the Toto or the Guinea dance, performed to the beating of drums. While Enslaved Africans no doubt looked forward to Pinkster for the break from their daily drudgery and the socializing, it does not minimize the horrors of their Enslavement. =Race- based legislation= Some time between 1811 and 1813 despite or perhaps because of its popularity, the city of Albany, New York passed a city ordinance banning the drinking and dancing associated with Pinkster. Whites were concerned that the congregation and socialization of large groups of African Americans could provide them with the opportunity to plot or plan revolution. Some historians believe the council wanted to eliminate Pinkster because it didn't appeal to the burgeoning middle class, pointing to the fact that the law was eventually overturned, which would contradict the motivation of preventing uprisings. This law was only repealed in 2011. Albert James Williams Myers, professor of Black Studies at the State University of New York at New Paltz remarks, \\"I think that political officials in Albany and elsewhere within New York felt that since Pinkster was a gathering for Africans that perhaps it could lead to a revolt and so I think it was really fear of the possibility that something like this could happen that we have to bring it to an end. So for all intents and purposes Pinkster is a memory, at least the way it was celebrated along the Hudson before 1811.\\" In modern times Since the 1970s, efforts have been made to resurrect Pinkster in New York, such as at Philipsburg Manor House, an 18th-century living history museum located in Sleepy Hollow, New York, once the central location for milling and mercantile operations in the Hudson Valley. Every Spring, Philipsburg Manor recreates an authentic celebration of Pinkster in North America, combining both Dutch and African traditions. In Albany Pinksterfest has been incorporated into the city's annual Tulip Festival, celebrated on Mother's Day. Pinkster is still recognized as an official holiday in The Netherlands, though many of the early types of celebrations are no longer in fashion, rendering the long weekend more just a basic holiday for all.

The music was written mainly by guitarist Tony Iommi, but ‚Äì as with almost all Sabbath albums ‚Äì credit is given to the entire band. The lyrics were written entirely by newcomer Ronnie James Dio. The song has been performed by several bands of which Iommi and Dio were members including Black Sabbath, Dio, and Heaven & Hell. Details Keyboardist Geoff Nicholls, who was a session keyboard player during the recording of the album, is said to have been responsible for this song's bassline. The bassline closely resembles that of \\"Mainline Riders\\" by Quartz, of which Nicholls was a former member. Geezer Butler was not available during initial recording of the song in late 1979. Performed live by Black Sabbath, Dio and Heaven & Hell, the song was often stretched out with an extended guitar solo, audience participation, ad-libbed lyrics, or additional lyrics regarding angelic and demonic apparitions and personal judgment. Many later Sabbath lineups included this song in live sets, during which it was variously sung by Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen, and Tony Martin. An official live recording, featuring Martin on vocals, featured on 1995's Cross Purposes Live. Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford sang the song with Sabbath on 14 and 15 November 1992, when he filled in at two concerts. \\"Heaven and Hell\\" was ranked No. 11 in Martin Popoff's book The Top 500 Heavy Metal Songs of All Time. Popoff compiled the book by asking thousands of fans, musicians, and journalists to nominated their favourite metal songs. Almost 18,000 individual votes were tallied and entered into a database from which the final rankings were derived. The song was named the 81st best hard rock song of all time by VH1. It was ranked the eighth best Black Sabbath song by Rock - Das Gesamtwerk der gr√∂√üten Rock-Acts im Check. The song's intro was used during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert to introduce Tony Iommi. Lyrics : In an interview for VH1's \\"Heavy: The Story of Metal\\", Dio stated that the song is about the ability of each human being to choose between doing good and doing evil; essentially, that each person has \\"heaven and hell\\" inside themselves.

Geology About 200 to 240 million years ago (in the Carboniferous Period, at the end of the Paleozoic Era), the eastern Tennessee area was covered with a shallow sea, the sediments of which eventually formed limestone rock.Ruby Falls Geology, Ruby Falls Rocks, accessed 11 June 2006 About 200 million years ago, this area was uplifted, forming Lookout Mountain and nearby ridges. Slightly acidic groundwater running through cracks in the limestone slowly dissolved the relatively soluble rock, causing narrow cracks to widen into passages. This process, called chemical weathering, formed various caves to form inside Lookout Mountain. Among them were Lookout Mountain Cave, which opened to the outside, and Ruby Falls Cave, which did not. The two were unconnected until developers joined them to create Lookout Mountain Caverns. Ruby Falls Cave is the upper of the two and contains a variety of geological formations and curiosities that Lookout Mountain Cave does not have. Ruby Falls Cave features many of the more well-known types of cave formations (or speleothems) including stalactites and stalagmites, columns, drapery, and flowstone. The limestone in which the cave is formed is still relatively horizontal, just as it was deposited below sea level. The Falls are located at the end of the main passage of Ruby Falls Cave, in a large vertical shaft. The stream, 1,120 feet underground, is fed both by rainwater and natural springs. It collects in a pool in the cave floor and then continues through the mountain until finally joining the Tennessee River at the base of Lookout Mountain. History Lookout Mountain Castle Ruby Falls Cave, unlike Lookout Mountain Cave, had no natural openings and could not be entered until the 20th century; it therefore does not have the various artifacts which are often associated with caves in the southeastern United States. In 1905 the natural entrance to Lookout Mountain Cave was closed during the construction of a railway tunnel. In the 1920s a chemist and cave enthusiast named Leo Lambert thought that he could re-open the cave as a tourist attraction, and formed a company to do so. He planned to make an opening farther up the mountain than the original opening and transport tourists to the cave via an elevator. For this purpose, his company purchased land on the side of Lookout Mountain above Lookout Mountain Cave and in 1928 began to drill through the limestone. In doing so, they discovered a small passageway about 18 inches high and four feet wide. Exploring this opening, Lambert discovered the formerly hidden Ruby Falls Cave and its waterfall. On his next trip to visit the cave, Lambert took his wife Ruby, and told her that he would name the falls after her.Ruby Falls History. Jane Derthick and Hu Longmire. Press Release. , accessed 11 June 2006 After the discovery of the cave housing Ruby Falls the tunnelers kept digging to locate the original cave they were searching for, the Lookout Mountain caverns, which they reached 1,120 feet underground. On December 30, 1929 the Lookout Mountain caverns were open to the public, and by the following year in June the Ruby Falls cave was expanded and opened as well. By 1935 the lower of the two caves was blocked off due to Ruby Falls being the far more popular of the two caves. In 1954, the pathway around the basin was cut in order to allow tourists a better view of the falls. This began the tour-related quip regarding not drinking the falls' water. Though pure and thus safe to drink, it has large concentrations of magnesium from the strata of the mountain, which makes it a natural laxative. In 1975, the secondary exit from the falls to the base of the mountain was cut. This was to comply with recreation regulations in Tennessee. The secondary exit is used in the event that the main shaft elevator fails. This secondary exit was used for the popular Ruby Falls Haunted Cavern until 2017 when the event was renamed Dread Hollow and was moved to a new location. The haunted attraction is open to the public from late September, through October. In April 2007, the National Speleological Society (NSS) published \\"Caves of Chattanooga\\" by Larry E. Matthews. Chapter 3, \\"Ruby Falls Cave\\", covers the history of Ruby Falls Cave from its discovery in 1928 through 2007 (includes 23 illustrations). Chapter 1, \\"Lookout Mountain Cave\\", covers the cave Leo Lambert was drilling for when he accidentally discovered Ruby Falls Cave. Tourism and advertising Ruby Falls Lambert decided to open both caves to the public, although Lookout Mountain Cave was closed in 1935 since it was not very popular with tourists, who were much more impressed with the upper cave. Public tours began in 1930. Electric lights were installed in the cave, making it one of the first commercial caves to be so outfitted.Ruby Falls of Chattanooga, History. , accessed 11 June 2006 Motorists travelling on I-75 in the 1970s and 1980s were subjected to dozens - maybe hundreds - of billboards along their route with the words \\"SEE RUBY FALLS\\" beginning hundreds of miles north and south of the falls itself. Ruby Falls remains a staple of Chattanooga tourism, operating daily. Ruby Falls is owned by the Steiner family of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Ruby Falls and the larger Lookout Mountain Caverns complex have been designated a National Historic Landmark. It is often associated with the nearby Rock City attraction, which lies atop Lookout Mountain.

These regions were further divided into ten provinces. The Southern Provinces or Moroccan Sahara are the terms used by the Moroccan government for Western Sahara. These two official Moroccan denominations explicitly include all of Western Sahara, which spans three of country's 12 top-level administrative regions (although only one region lies entirely within Western Sahara). A frequent use of the term \\"Southern Provinces\\" is found for example in Moroccan state television (weather forecasts, displayed maps on the news, government statements, etc.). Overview The Moroccan government controls and administers roughly four-fifths of Western Sahara (the part west of the Moroccan Wall), while the rest makes up the Free Zone held by the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic) and all the oceanic coasts of Western Sahara. Government and private companies exploit coastal areas for fishing and the land areas for phosphate mining. The Polisario Front controls the remaining fifth, which is isolated from the ocean, mostly empty of any population, dry, and unfit for conventional urbanization or any basic economic activity. The two thirds of Western Sahara that are controlled by Morocco are treated by the government as normal Moroccan territory. The government conducts various economic and social development programs and includes these \\"Southern Provinces\\" in the national budget of government funding, national sport competitions, education programs, and national parliamentary elections. Following the Green March and the Madrid Accords signed with Spain and Mauritania in 1975, Morocco took control of Saguia el-Hamra, and the northern part of R√≠o de Oro, while Mauritania took control of the remaining part of R√≠o de Oro, renamed as Tiris al-Gharbiyya. A locally based Saharawi national liberation movement, the Polisario Front launched a guerrilla war, with the crucial financial and logistical backing of Algeria and Libya, aiming to win independence of the territory under the \\"Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic\\" (SADR). Following bloody clashes with the Polisario troops (SPLA) and deteriorating ties with Algeria, Mauritania pulled out in 1979 and gave up its share in the Western Sahara in order to avoid further complicated conflicts with the Sahrawi Republic, Algeria, and Morocco. Morocco then seized the opportunity and took control of the remaining part of R√≠o de Oro as well, which had been recognized by the Moroccan regime as Mauritanian a few years earlier. Since a United Nations-sponsored ceasefire agreement in 1991, about two thirds of the territory is administered by Morocco, including all the seacoasts, due to the construction of the Moroccan Wall. The Polisario Front controls most of the remainder, which is almost unpopulated. Polisario's army is considered incapable of covering the vast one-third of Western Sahara, east of the Moroccan military berm. Moreover, most of Polisario's army is thought to be concentrated in the Tinduf area inside Algeria, safe from the long arm of Morocco's superior artillery and air force. The ceasefire line corresponds to the route of the Moroccan Wall (the military berm). Both sides claim the territory of Western Sahara in its entirety. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic had been recognized by 84 nations, and is a full member of the African Union, but not of the UN. Moroccan territorial integrity is implicitly recognized by the Arab League with strong reservations from Algeria and Syria. Administratively, Morocco divided the territory under its control into administrative units (wilayas). Flags and coats of arms were created for the three wilayas of Boujdour, Smara and Laayoune. There were further changes in the territories in 1983, with the area becoming four wilayas through the addition of Dakhla. In 1990 Wadi al- Dhahab (R√≠o de Oro) was added.

Education and war years Born in Wareham, Gass was the eldest son of George Irving Gass and Norah Elizabeth Mustard. Gass was educated at King's School, Bruton, and then later obtained degrees at both Queens' College, Cambridge and Oxford University. After university he entered the Colonial Administration Service. His first appointment was to the Gold Coast in 1939. During World War II Gass entered the Army and achieved the rank of Major, he served in East Africa and Burma with the Gold Coast Regiment of the Royal West African Frontier Force (1939‚Äì1945); he was twice mentioned in despatches. Career Confrontation between rioters and the Hong Kong Police Force during the riots in 1967 After the war he returned to the Service, spending three years in Ashanti and two in Ghana before being posted in 1958 to the West Pacific High Commission as Chief Secretary. From then until his retirement in 1973 he remained in the Far East, notably in Hong Kong where he was Colonial Secretary and Acting Governor intermittently between 1965 and 1969. In the colonial secretary's tenure, he and Ronald Holmes and Jack Cater and other government officials had to deal with riots in 1967 against British colonial rule. During the disorder, Governor Sir David Trench happened to be absent from Hong Kong and all of a sudden there was no one fully in command of the government. As a result, Gass became acting-Governor, and therefore it was Holmes and Gass who were in charge in the crisis. During the riots, he took a tough stance against the activists, to effectively control the situation, but has also become one of the main targets of attack leftist camp vocal opposition. He became High Commissioner for the Western Pacific on 12 February 1969.Sir Michael Gass. The Times (London, England), Wednesday, 2 March 1983; pg. 14 When he returned to England, Gass served as a Member of Somerset County Council (1977‚Äì1981). Personal life Gass was appointed Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1960 Birthday Honours and was promoted to Knight Commander of Order of St Michael and St George in the 1969 New Year Honours. Gass married Elizabeth Acland-Hood in 1975. They had no children.

He was convicted of the murders of four women between February and July 1999: Carole Sund, her teenage daughter Juli Sund and their teenage traveling companion Silvina Pelosso; and Yosemite Institute naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong. The murders occurred in Mariposa County, California, near Yosemite National Park. Stayner was sentenced to death for the four murders, and is still on death row at San Quentin Penitentiary in California. Early life Cary Stayner was born and raised in Merced, California. His younger brother, Steven Stayner, was kidnapped by child molester Kenneth Parnell in 1972, when Cary was 11, and held captive for more than seven years before escaping and being reunited with his family. Stayner later said that he felt neglected while his parents grieved over the loss of Steven. When Steven escaped from Parnell and returned home in 1980, he received massive media attention. A true crime book and TV movie, both titled I Know My First Name is Steven, were made about the ordeal. Steven died in a motorcycle accident in 1989. The following year Stayner's uncle Jesse, with whom he was living at the time, was murdered. Stayner later claimed that his uncle molested him at the same period as when Steven was kidnapped. Stayner is reported to have attempted suicide in 1991, and was arrested in 1997 for possession of marijuana and methamphetamine, although these charges were eventually dropped. Crimes In 1997, Stayner was hired as a handyman at the Cedar Lodge motel in El Portal, California, just outside the Highway 140 entrance to Yosemite National Park. Between February and July 1999, he murdered two women and two teenagers: 42-year-old Carole Sund, her daughter, 15-year-old Juli Sund, Juli's friend, 16-year-old Argentine exchange student Silvina Pelosso, and Yosemite Institute employee Joie Ruth Armstrong, a 26-year old naturalist. The first two victims, Sund and Pelosso, were found in the trunk of the charred remains of Sund's Pontiac rental car. The bodies were burned beyond recognition and were identified using dental records. A note was sent to police with a hand-drawn map indicating the location of the third victim, Sund's daughter Juli. The top of the note read, \\"We had fun with this one.\\" Investigators went to the location depicted on the map and found the remains of Juli, whose throat had been cut. Detectives began interviewing employees of the Cedar Lodge motel where the first three victims had been staying just before their deaths. One of those employees was Stayner, but he was not considered a suspect at that point because he had no criminal history and remained calm during the police interview. When the decapitated body of Joie Ruth Armstrong was found, eyewitnesses said they saw a blue 1979 International Scout parked outside the cabin where she was staying. Detectives traced this vehicle to Stayner, which led to him becoming the prime suspect in the case. FBI agents John Boles and Jeff Rinek found Stayner staying at the Laguna del Sol nudist resort in Wilton, where he was arrested and taken to Sacramento for questioning. During his interrogation, Stayner shocked the agents when he confessed not only to Armstrong's decapitation, but to the murders of Pelosso and the Sunds, and the sending of the map for finding Juli Sund's body as well. His vehicle yielded evidence proving his link to Armstrong. Stayner claimed after his arrest that he had fantasized about murdering women since he was seven years old, long before the abduction of his brother. Trial and conviction Stayner pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. His lawyers claimed that the Stayner family had a history of sexual abuse and mental illness, manifesting itself not only in the murders, but also his obsessive-compulsive disorder and his request to be provided with child pornography in return for his confession. Dr. Jose Arturo Silva testified that Stayner had obsessive-compulsive disorder, mild autism, and paraphilia. He was nevertheless found sane and convicted of four counts of first degree murder by a jury on August 27, 2002. Sentencing and wait for execution In 2002, during the penalty phase of his trial, Stayner was sentenced to death and thereafter entered housing in the Adjustment Center on death row at San Quentin Penitentiary in California. Stayner remains on death row as of September 2019 though there have been no executions in California since a 2006 court ruling finding flaws in the administration of capital punishment in the state.

The equation is also known as the Papperitz equation. The hypergeometric differential equation is a second-order linear differential equation which has three regular singular points, 0, 1 and \\\\infty. That equation admits two linearly independent solutions; near a singularity z_s, the solutions take the form x^s f(x), where x = z-z_s is a local variable, and f is locally holomorphic with f(0) eq0. The real number s is called the exponent of the solution at z_s. Let Œ±, Œ≤ and Œ≥ be the exponents of one solution at 0, 1 and \\\\infty respectively; and let Œ±', Œ≤' and Œ≥' be those of the other. Then :\\\\alpha + \\\\alpha' + \\\\beta + \\\\beta' + \\\\gamma + \\\\gamma' = 1. By applying suitable changes of variable, it is possible to transform the hypergeometric equation: Applying M√∂bius transformations will adjust the positions of the RSPs, while other transformations (see below) can change the exponents at the RSPs, subject to the exponents adding up to 1. Definition The differential equation is given by :\\\\frac{d^2w}{dz^2} + \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1-\\\\alpha-\\\\alpha'}{z-a} + \\\\frac{1-\\\\beta-\\\\beta'}{z-b} + \\\\frac{1-\\\\gamma-\\\\gamma'}{z-c} \\\\right] \\\\frac{dw}{dz} ::+\\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\alpha' (a-b)(a-c)} {z-a} +\\\\frac{\\\\beta\\\\beta' (b-c)(b-a)} {z-b} +\\\\frac{\\\\gamma\\\\gamma' (c-a)(c-b)} {z-c} \\\\right] \\\\frac{w}{(z-a)(z-b)(z-c)}=0. The regular singular points are , , and . The exponents of the solutions at these RSPs are, respectively, , , and . As before, the exponents are subject to the condition :\\\\alpha+\\\\alpha'+\\\\beta+\\\\beta'+\\\\gamma+\\\\gamma'=1. Solutions and relationship with the hypergeometric function The solutions are denoted by the Riemann P-symbol (also known as the Papperitz symbol) :w(z)=P \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} a & b & c & \\\\;  \\\\alpha & \\\\beta & \\\\gamma & z  \\\\alpha' & \\\\beta' & \\\\gamma' & \\\\; \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} The standard hypergeometric function may be expressed as :\\\\;_2F_1(a,b;c;z) = P \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} 0 & \\\\infty & 1 & \\\\;  0 & a & 0 & z  1-c & b & c-a-b & \\\\; \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} The P-functions obey a number of identities; one of them allows a general P-function to be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function. It is :P \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} a & b & c & \\\\;  \\\\alpha & \\\\beta & \\\\gamma & z  \\\\alpha' & \\\\beta' & \\\\gamma' & \\\\; \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{z-a}{z-b}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha \\\\left(\\\\frac{z-c}{z-b}\\\\right)^\\\\gamma P \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} 0 & \\\\infty & 1 & \\\\;  0 & \\\\alpha+\\\\beta+\\\\gamma & 0 & \\\\;\\\\frac{(z-a)(c-b)}{(z-b)(c-a)}  \\\\alpha'-\\\\alpha & \\\\alpha+\\\\beta'+\\\\gamma & \\\\gamma'-\\\\gamma & \\\\; \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} In other words, one may write the solutions in terms of the hypergeometric function as :w(z)= \\\\left(\\\\frac{z-a}{z-b}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha \\\\left(\\\\frac{z-c}{z-b}\\\\right)^\\\\gamma \\\\;_2F_1 \\\\left( \\\\alpha+\\\\beta +\\\\gamma, \\\\alpha+\\\\beta'+\\\\gamma; 1+\\\\alpha-\\\\alpha'; \\\\frac{(z-a)(c-b)}{(z-b)(c-a)} \\\\right) The full complement of Kummer's 24 solutions may be obtained in this way; see the article hypergeometric differential equation for a treatment of Kummer's solutions. Fractional linear transformations The P-function possesses a simple symmetry under the action of fractional linear transformations known as M√∂bius transformations (that are the conformal remappings of the Riemann sphere), or equivalently, under the action of the group . Given arbitrary complex numbers , , , such that , define the quantities :u=\\\\frac{Az+B}{Cz+D} \\\\quad \\\\text{ and } \\\\quad \\\\eta=\\\\frac{Aa+B}{Ca+D} and :\\\\zeta=\\\\frac{Ab+B}{Cb+D} \\\\quad \\\\text{ and } \\\\quad \\\\theta=\\\\frac{Ac+B}{Cc+D} then one has the simple relation :P \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} a & b & c & \\\\;  \\\\alpha & \\\\beta & \\\\gamma & z  \\\\alpha' & \\\\beta' & \\\\gamma' & \\\\; \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} =P \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\eta & \\\\zeta & \\\\theta & \\\\;  \\\\alpha & \\\\beta & \\\\gamma & u  \\\\alpha' & \\\\beta' & \\\\gamma' & \\\\; \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} expressing the symmetry.

It was introduced in Porter's first Broadway success, the musical Paris (1928) by French chanteuse Ir√®ne Bordoni for whom Porter had written the musical as a starring vehicle. Bordoni's husband and Paris producer Ray Goetz convinced Porter to give Broadway another try with this show. The song was later used in the English production of Wake Up and Dream (1929) and was used as the title theme music in the 1933 Hollywood movie, Grand Slam starring Loretta Young and Paul Lukas. In 1960 it was also included in the film version of Cole Porter's Can-Can. History The first of Porter's \\"list songs\\", it features a string of suggestive and droll comparisons and examples, preposterous pairings and double entendres, dropping famous names and events, drawing from highbrow and popular culture. Porter was a strong admirer of the Savoy Operas of Gilbert & Sullivan, many of whose stage works featured similar comic list songs. The first refrain covers human ethnic groups, the second refrain birds, the third refrain marine life, the fourth refrain insects and centipedes, and the fifth refrain non-human mammals. One commentator saw the phrase Let's do \\"it\\" as a euphemistic reference to a proposition for sexual intercourse. According to this argument, Let's do it was a pioneer pop song to declare openly \\"sex is fun\\". According to it, several suggestive lines include a couplet from verse 4: \\"Moths in your rugs do it, What's the use of moth-balls?\\" and \\"Folks in Siam do it, Think of Siamese twins\\" (verse 1) and \\"Why ask if shad do it? Waiter, bring me shad roe\\" (verse 3) and \\"Sweet guinea-pigs do it, Buy a couple and wait\\" (verse 5). The nature of the song is such that it has lent itself over the years to the regular addition of contemporary or topical stanzas. For example, in 1955 the lines \\"Even Liberace, we assume, does it,\\" \\"Ernest Hemingway could -just- do it\\" and many more were added by No√´l Coward in his Las Vegas cabaret performance of the song, in which he replaced all of Porter's lyrics with his own. Legacy The song has been revived many times since 1928, although usually with only a limited portion of the original lyrics. A punk rock version performed by Joan Jett and Paul Westerberg was used as the theme song in the 1995 movie Tank Girl, and later in a more classical version in a musical revue number within the film. In the revue, the song is at first performed by stage actress Ann Magnuson, but is taken over by star Lori Petty after she places duct tape over Magnuson's mouth. It was originally recorded with Joan Jett and Greg Graffin, but Atlantic Records did not want them using Graffin so they deleted his voice and recorded Westerberg's. Joan Jett and Greg Graffin's version of \\"Let's Do It\\" was eventually released in 2000 on the compilation CD Laguna Tunes (Blackheart Records). The White Stripes' song \\"Forever for Her (Is Over for Me)\\", from their 2005 album Get Behind Me Satan, borrows lyrics and themes from the song. Brazilian singers Chico Buarque and Elza Soares recorded a Portuguese adaptation by Carlos Renn√≥, \\"Fa√ßamos - Vamos Amar\\", on Buarque's 2002 album Duetos. Scottish singer Shirley Manson of Garbage incorporated lyrics from the song into Garbage's performance of their song \\"Vow\\" at Bizarre festival in 1996. The song is featured prominently in Woody Allen's 2011 film Midnight in Paris. Actor Yves Heck played Cole Porter in the movie. Racial lyrics controversy In Porter's publication from 1928, the opening lines for the chorus carried three derogatory racial references: Chinks, Japs, and Laps. The original was: > Chinks do it, Japs do it, > up in Lapland little Laps do it... > The original line can be heard in several early recordings of the song, such as a recording made by the Dorsey Brothers & their Orchestra (featuring a vocal by a young Bing Crosby), Rudy Vall√©e, Paul Whiteman And His Orchestra, all in 1928, and a version of the song by the singer and well-known Broadway star Mary Martin (with Ray Sinatra's orchestra), recorded in 1944. Another example is Billie Holiday, in 1941. Peggy Lee with the Benny Goodman orchestra recorded a version in 1941 with these lyrics. CBS came up with less offensive lyrics, which NBC adopted, and changed the opening to the refrain: \\"Birds do it, bees do it\\" when he realized that the line was offensive.

The area is predominantly rural, with the exceptions of Abilene and Lubbock, and includes many state parks, ranches, and farms. This is one of the most conservative districts in Texas and the nation. It has not supported a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964. Republicans have held the seat since 1985. In the last three decades, a Democrat has only won 40 percent of the vote in this district twice, in 1984 and 2004. Much of this region continued to elect conservative Democrats to local offices and the Texas Legislature until 1994. Since the mid-1990s, however, Republicans have dominated every level of government. There are virtually no elected Democrats left above the county level, and Republicans usually win most races by 70 percent or more of the vote. The district voted 77% for George W.

It is homologous with the nostril of other mammals, and evolved via gradual movement of the nostrils to the top of the head.https://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/03/whale-evolution.html As whales reach the water surface to breathe, they forcefully expel air through the blowhole. The exhalation is released into the comparably lower-pressure, colder atmosphere, and any water vapor condenses. This spray, known as the blow, is often visible from far away as a white splash, which can also be caused by water resting on top of the blowhole. Air sacs just below the blowhole allow whales to produce sounds for communication and, for toothed whales, echolocation. These air sacs are filled with air, which is then released again to produce sound in a similar fashion to releasing air from a balloon. When whales dive under water their nasal plug covers the nasal passage to the blowhole. The muscles controlling the nasal plug are relaxed during this time, but when the whale comes up for air these muscles contract and allow for the blowhole to be opened and the process of exhalation and inhalation to occur. Baleen whales have two blowholes positioned in a V-shape while toothed whales have only one blowhole. The blowhole of a sperm whale, a toothed whale, is located left of centre in the frontal area of the snout, and is actually its left nostril, while the right nostril lacks an opening to the surface and its nasal passage is otherwise well developed. The trachea only connects to the blowhole, and the animal cannot breathe through its mouth. Because of this, there is no risk of food entering the animal's lungs, so whales have no gag reflex.

The film stars Sean Connery as Robin Hood, Audrey Hepburn as Lady Marian, Nicol Williamson as Little John, Robert Shaw as the Sheriff of Nottingham, and Richard Harris as Richard the Lionheart. It also features comedian Ronnie Barker in a rare film role as Friar Tuck. Robin and Marian was filmed in Zamora, Spain and in Artajona, Urbasa, Quinto Real and Orgi, all small medieval villages in Navarre. It marked Hepburn's return to the screen after an eight-year absence. Lester made Robin and Marian amid a series of period pieces, including The Three Musketeers (1973). The original music score was composed by John Barry. The film originally was titled The Death of Robin Hood but was changed by Columbia Pictures to be more marketable,p.178 Norwich, Brahm Dilemmas of Difference, Inclusion and Disability: International Perspectives and Future Directions Routledge, 2008 and perhaps give equal billing to Hepburn.  Plot  An aging Robin Hood is a trusted captain fighting for King Richard the Lionheart in France, the Crusades long over. Richard orders him to take a castle that is rumoured to hold a gold statue. Discovering that it is defended by a solitary, one-eyed old man who is sheltering women and children, and being told that the statue is worthless stone, Robin and his right-hand man, Little John, refuse to attack. King Richard, angry at their insubordination, orders the pair's execution and the castle attacked, but is wounded with an arrow by the old man. Richard has the helpless residents massacred, with the exception of the old man, because Richard likes his eye. The King offers to let Robin beg for his life. When Robin refuses, Richard draws his sword, but having been wounded, lacks the strength to strike him and falls to the floor. Robin helps the dying king and, moved by his loyalty, Richard frees Robin and Little John. Robin and Little John return to England and are reunited with old friends Will Scarlet and Friar Tuck in Sherwood Forest. He hears that his exploits have become legendary. When Robin casually inquires about Maid Marian, they tell him she is still alive and where she lives. When he goes to see her, she finds him as impossible as ever, while he discovers that she has become an abbess. He learns that his old nemesis, the Sheriff of Nottingham, has ordered her arrest in response to the King's order to expel senior leaders of the Roman Catholic Church from England. When the Sheriff comes to arrest Marian, Marian wants no trouble, but Robin rescues her against her will, striking Sir Ranulf, the Sheriff's arrogant guest, in the process. He also later rescues the nuns, who have been locked in the Sheriff's castle. Ignoring the Sheriff's warnings, Sir Ranulf pursues Robin into the forest. His men are ambushed and a number killed by arrows; Sir Ranulf is left unharmed only because Robin orders him spared. When the news of Robin's return spreads, old comrades and new recruits rally once more to him. Sir Ranulf asks King John for 200 soldiers to deal with Robin. The Sheriff waits in the fields beyond the Forest, knowing Robin will be unable to resist indefinitely the temptation to attack, despite the open terrain, which is unfavourable for Robin's untrained and greatly outnumbered men against the King's trained soldiers. When Robin does, he proposes that he and the Sheriff fight by single combat to settle the issue, despite the protests of Sir Ranulf. Although Robin appears to be the stronger at the start of the fight, it becomes clear that the Sheriff is more than a match for him. Eventually the Sheriff has the wounded Robin at his mercy and demands his surrender. Refusing, Robin manages to kill the Sheriff with the last of his strength. Led by Sir Ranulf, the soldiers attack and scatter Robin's ragtag band, many of whom are captured or killed. Will Scarlet and Friar Tuck are captured but Little John manages to kill Sir Ranulf. John and Marian take Robin to her abbey, where she keeps her medicine. Robin believes he will recover to win future battles. Little John stands guard outside while Marian tends to Robin's wounds. Marian prepares a draught of medicine and drinks some herself before giving it to Robin. He drinks it and notes that the pain has gone away and his legs have gone numb. Realizing that she has poisoned them both, he cries out for Little John. However, he comes to understand that Marian has acted out of love because he would never be the same man again. She tells him: > \\"I love you. More than all you know. I love you more than children. More > than fields I've planted with my hands. I love you more than morning prayers > or peace or food to eat. I love you more than sunlight, more than flesh or > joy, or one more day. I love you ... more than God.\\" Robin and Marian try to touch each other's hands as Little John crashes through the door and weeps at Robin's bedside. Robin asks Little John for his bow and shoots an arrow from his deathbed through the open window, and tells him to bury them both where it lands. The arrow soars out of the window into the distance. Apples are seen decaying on the windowsill.

It currently holds a 73% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 33 reviews. Roger Ebert was positive towards Connery and Hepburn as Robin and Marian, although he was uncertain about \\"history repeating itself\\" in regard to the plot. According to Ebert, \\"What prevents the movie from really losing its way, though, are the performances of Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn in the title roles. No matter what the director and the writer may think, Connery and Hepburn seem to have arrived at a tacit understanding between themselves about their characters. They glow. They really do seem in love. And they project as marvelously complex, fond, tender people; the passage of 20 years has given them grace and wisdom.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review by Roger Ebert , April 21, 1976, Retrieved on July 7, 2008 He also approved of the film's cinematography in comparison to early films of the genre, noting that, \\"Lester photographs them with more restraint than he might have used 10 years ago. His active camera is replaced here by a visual tempo more suited to bittersweet nostalgia. He photographs Sherwood Forest and its characters with a nice off- hand realism that's better than the pretentious solemnity we sometimes get in historical pictures\\".

The character was created by Gardner Fox (writer) and Mike Sekowsky (penciller), and made his first appearance in The Brave and the Bold in February 1960. From 1960 to 1969, Snapper Carr appeared as a supporting character to the Justice League of America, a superhero team. The character occasionally appeared in comics featuring the Justice League from 1969 to 1989, when the Invasion! limited-series comic book gave him superpowers. Snapper was associated with a new superhero team, The Blasters, in various comics until 1993, when he lost his powers and became a main character in the Hourman comic book, beginning in 1999. After the cancellation of Hourman in April 2001, he became a main character in the Young Justice comic book beginning in December 2001. Young Justice was cancelled in May 2003, and he became associated with the governmental organization Checkmate, a role revealed when the character played a small but important role in the 2007-2008 limited series comic book 52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen. The character made major appearances in Final Crisis: Resist in December 2008 and Justice League of America 80-Page Giant in November 2009. Creation and early characterization In 1959, after the successful revival of Flash and Green Lantern, DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz decided to update the Justice Society of America using a new group of heroes under the name Justice League of America (JLA). According to Schwartz, DC Comics Executive Editor Whitney Ellsworth not only insisted that a teenager be a member of the Justice League but also that this teenager be hip. Ellsworth wanted the new superhero team to tap into the emerging and economically powerful youth culture, and specifically told Schwartz to have the character emulate the hip-talking, leather jacket-wearing, finger-snapping \\"Kookie\\" Kookson character on the popular television series 77 Sunset Strip. The teenager had to be a \\"civilian\\" (i.e., non-superhero). A hip version of an existing teenage superhero, such as Robin, Supergirl, or existing teenage \\"civilian\\" such as Jimmy Olsen was ruled out, as these characters would tend to over-emphasize the hero with whom they were already associated. To preserve the \\"team\\" nature of the new comic book, therefore, a \\"neutral\\" civilian character had to be created. Ellsworth specifically coined the name \\"Snapper Carr\\", the character's first name indicating his habit of snapping his fingers when excited or making a point. Snapper's given name of Lucas was not revealed until 1978.The Superman Family #188 (March‚ÄìApril 1978). Snapper Carr made his first appearance, alongside the first appearance of the JLA, in the comic book The Brave and the Bold #28, released December 29, 1959, but with a cover date of February‚ÄìMarch 1960.The Brave and the Bold #28 (February‚ÄìMarch 1960). Snapper Carr was not intended to be a superhero, but rather a supporting character for the Justice League. Because of the critical role he played in the League's first adventure, he was formally made an \\"honorary member\\" of the JLA, and was often referred to as the team's mascot.Justice League of America Vol. 1 #77 (December 1969). At the end of the first adventure, Snapper received a belt with a signal device embedded in the buckle, with which he can summon members of the JLA. In keeping with his \\"hip\\" character, Justice League members later rebuilt a hot rod car so that it could fly and whisk Snapper to JLA meetings. As written by Gardner Fox, Snapper Carr had the most distinctive personality of all the members of the Justice League. Fox's writing focused on action, not character, and the dialogue he gave his superheroes was so bland as to be interchangeable among the characters. Snapper not only had the most distinctive means of speaking (with his extreme hipster slang), but he had the most clearly written and individualist character of all the recurring characters in the comic book. Within a few years, Fox got rid of the hipster slang and had Snapper speak in a more mainstream way, which had the side-effect of giving the character no discernible personality. Snapper's parents are identified in The Brave and the Bold #28 as Mr. and Mrs. John Carr. Two years later, readers learn in 1961 that he has a younger brother, Jimmy Carr.Justice League of America Vol. 1 #2 (December 1961-January 1962). Snapper Carr was given a girlfriend, Midge, in Justice League of America Vol. 1 #7 (November 1961). Snapper was also shown in 1974 to have a sister, Janet. In 1998, readers learned that Snapper had an uncle, Simon Carr, who played a major role in the founding of the Justice League.JLA: Year One #2 (February 1998). A year later, Snapper mentioned in Hourman #1 that he has a brother nicknamed \\"Spitter\\" Carr (for his habit of spitting).Hourman #1 (April 1999). (It is unclear if Spitter and Jimmy are the same person, or if Snapper was merely being sarcastic.) Fictional character biography =Membership in the Justice League= In The Brave and the Bold #28, the Justice League of America faces the threat of Starro, a giant alien starfish with mind-control powers. Snapper Carr, who is spreading lime on his family's lawn, is unaffected by Starro when the alien takes mental control of the population of Happy Harbor, Rhode Island. Members of the Justice League realize that Starro can be incapacitated using lime, and the alien is defeated. Comic book historian Ramzi Fawaz has argued that this adventure is a critical one in the development of the modern comic book. Not only does it mark the beginning of the superhero who identifies as a defender of the world rather than a nation, it marks the first time that a world-destroying (rather than nation-destroying) threat was depicted in comics. Snapper Carr's inclusion was also important. Whereas pre-World War II social norms had emphasized family connections as the most important relationships in a young person's life, the Justice League offered a new kind of relationship, based solely on \\"ethical commitments to the world\\", which could supplant the family. Snapper also represented a new egalitarian future, one in which youth could be accepted alongside older adults rather than patronized or excluded. For example, Snapper's first year as an honorary member of the JLA coincided with his senior year of high school. In \\"Man, Thy Name Is‚ÄîBrother!\\", three League members donate their time to help Snapper write a paper about brotherhood.Justice League of America Vol. 1 #57 (November 1967). In the 1985‚Äì1986 crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", DC Comics rebooted its fictional universe and the back-stories of nearly all its characters. This required retellings of many of origin stories, including that of the Justice League of America. The first adventures of the Justice League, and that of Snapper Carr, were retold in the 12-issue maxi-series comic book JLA: Year One. The first several issues of the maxi-series involved the alien race known as the Appellaxians, which had first appeared in Justice League of America Vol. 1 #9 (February 1962). In the fictional character chronology, this story occurs before and shortly after The Brave and the Bold #28, but in the publication history of the character it is printed in 1998. In the story, the Appellaxians conspired with a new criminal organization, Locus, to take over Earth. Snapper's uncle, Simon Carr, made his first appearance in the second issue, and in the third issue readers learned that Simon is the contact person for an ultra-wealthy individual (later revealed to be Oliver Queen) who wishes to financially support the Justice League in its mission. Simon introduced the League to college student and genius inventor Ted Kord (who is also the superhero Blue Beetle), who provided them with some technology, and to his nephew, Snapper.JLA: Year One #3 (March 1998). The adventure with Starro took place between JLA: Year One issues #3 and #4,JLA: Year One #4 (April 1998). and Snapper played a critical role in issue #9 in alerting the League to the Appellaxian attack on Earth.JLA: Year One #9 (September 1998). In issue #10, he deduced that his uncle had been possessed by the Appellaxian leader, and had the League defeat Simon and then free him from alien control.JLA: Year One #10 (October 1998). Another Snapper Carr story appeared in 2001, but in the fictional character chronology, the story occurred some time during his honorary membership in the Justice League. This time, Snapper assists the Atom in building equipment and running software programs to fight the villain Chronos.Legends of the DC Universe #40 (May 2001); Legends of the DC Universe #41 (June 2001). Betrayal of the JLA Gardner Fox left Justice League of America with issue #65,Justice League of America Vol. 1 #65 (September 1968). and Dennis O'Neil took over scripting duties. By this time, the Snapper Carr character was immensely unpopular. O'Neil felt Snapper was outdated and no longer fit with the Justice League. He considered two options: Letting the character disappear without explanation, or writing the character out of the book. O'Neil decided on the latter, even if it seemed abrupt. By the time the story \\"Snapper Carr‚ÄîSuper Traitor!\\" appeared, the Snapper Carr character had not been present in any Justice League of America stories for some time. The story begins with Snapper shown to be upset by the fact that people are interested in him only because of what he knows about the Justice League, and not because he is a hero in his own right. He is confronted by John Dough, \\"the most average man in America\\", who wants to rid the world of superheroes. Snapper helps Dough kidnap Batman, and addresses a public rally condemning superheroes. The crowd riots, and the Justice League members (except for new member Black Canary) lose control of their powers. After a fake Batman attacks people attending a congressional hearing into causes of the riot, Snapper resigns his honorary membership in the Justice League. When the League returns to its Secret Sanctuary (located in a seaside cave near Happy Harbor), they're attacked by Dough‚Äîwho turns out to be the Joker. Joker reveals that Snapper told \\"John Dough\\" the location of the League's Secret Sanctuary. The League captures the Joker, but Snapper has departed. Although the Secret Sanctuary had been compromised seven times before, the JLA now decided to abandon its \\"Secret Sanctuary\\" and build a new headquarters, the Justice League Satellite. It occupied this orbital hideout in February 1970.Justice League of America Vol. 1 #3 (February 1970). \\"Snapper Carr‚ÄîSuper Traitor!\\" was the last Joker story for four years, and the last time the Silver Age Joker was seen in print. A much darker, more Gothic Joker later appeared in Batman #251, and is the first appearance of the modern Joker.Batman Vol. 1 #251 (September 1973). This story also arguably marked the end of the Silver Age version of the Justice League of America as well. Although Snapper Carr was, in later comic book appearances, shown to have made money by writing a memoir about his time with the League, he was also depicted as feeling immense shame for having been tricked by the Joker into betraying the team.Hourman #16 (July 2000), Role in the Justice League and assessment Snapper's role in the Justice League was a varied one. In many early adventures, he often (and unintentionally) provided information or scientific clues which enabled the League to solve mysteries or defeat enemies. For example, in the team's third published adventure, \\"Case of the Stolen Super Powers!\\", several important zoo specimens have gone missing. Snapper mentions a few facts about long-lived creatures that he's incorporating into a term paper. Members of the JLA realize that the missing animals were all long-lived. This enables them to deduce the plans of Professor Ivo (who is trying to create an immortality serum) and defeat his android, Amazo.The Brave and the Bold, Vol. 1 #30 (July 1960). Usually, Snapper was depicted on \\"monitor duty\\", using the JLA computers and satellites to monitor national and world events for trouble to which the heroes could respond. Later, he was depicted as being a journalist, reporting on the League's activities and providing the \\"official\\" record of their exploits, as well as overseeing the JLA's mail handling and processing and responding to fans and admirers. Throughout the comic book series JLA: Year One, Snapper was also depicted as a mechanic and I.T. worker, overseeing the installation of a great deal of technology in the Secret Sanctuary and maintaining the hideout's machinery. Snapper Carr was almost \\"universally disliked\\" by readers during the character's 1960 to 1969 run. Comic book historian Michael Eury, however, has argued that many readers later came to appreciate what the character brought to the comic book. =Post-JLA= In the character's fictional biography, Snapper Carr made a number of appearances between 1969 and 1989. His first appearance came in 1972, a story in which the JLA meets with the Justice Society of America. Snapper is invited to attend, but is too ashamed by his betrayal of the League to do so.Justice League of America Vol. 1 #100 (August 1972). His second appearance came in 1974, when Justice League of America writer Len Wein decided to have Snapper and his family get kidnapped by a mentally ill man calling himself Anakronus. Anakronus claims to be a supervillain who has attacked the Justice League numerous times, but Snapper knows that the man has never tangled with the League before. Snapper succeeds in having Anakronus tell his (rather lengthy) stories about how he destroyed the League. This prevents the man from killing the Carr family for several hours. Members of the JLA show up and easily apprehend Anakronus.Justice League of America Vol. 1 #114 (November 1974). =The Star-Tsar= The Snapper Carr character was depicted as a supervillain in 1977. The Key was a villain who had brainwashed Snapper in 1965, and induced him to poison the JLA's food.Justice League of America Vol. 1 #41 (December 1965). In 1968, the Key implanted a post-hypnotic suggestion in the members of the JLA, which forced them to stay in their headquarters for one hour. At the end of that time, they would kill one another. The Key planned for Snapper to kill Superman with a kryptonite ray-gun.Justice League of America Vol. 1 #63 (June 1968). The Key battled the Justice League again in 1974, attempting to blow up the city of St. Louis, Missouri, but Snapper Carr was not present for this event (having resigned from the JLA five years earlier).Justice League of America Vol. 1 #110 (March 1974). The Key's 1977 involvement with Snapper Carr came in the story \\"The Face of the Star-Tsar!\\" Doctor Light, a long-time JLA foe, attempted to access the JLA Satellite. Mark Shaw, the former villainous Manhunter now in a new guise as the heroic Privateer, tried to stop him but was defeated. The JLA arrived and Light fled, only to run into a new villain‚Äîthe Star-Tsar. When the JLA caught up to the two villains, the Star- Tsar fled to the city of Washington, D.C., and attacked an embassy there. The JLA rushed to the nation's capital and apprehended the Star-Tsar's henchmen, but they could not locate the villain himself. They did, however, find Snapper Carr lurking nearby. The JLA then rushed off to Doctor Light's underwater lair in a lake in New York City's Central Park. Anticipating their arrival, Doctor Light trapped the heroes with a device that phased them out of our dimension. In a surprising turn of events, the Star-Tsar helped the Justice League escape before fleeing himself. Trapped in his own hideout by the JLA, Doctor Light blew a hole in the wall and escaped again. Leaving the villain's lair, the JLA discovered the unconscious Star-Tsar, who had been knocked out by debris from the blast. They unmasked him, only to discover that the Star-Tsar was Snapper Carr. Justice League of America Vol. 1 #149 (December 1977). The story continued in \\"The Key‚ÄîOr Not The Key\\", with Snapper/Star-Tsar freed by Star- Tsar henchmen. Several League members trace the henchmen's flying getaway vehicles to the Star-Tsar's lair. However, they are swiftly captured by the Key, who survived his last encounter with the Justice League back in 1974. Meanwhile, in Happy Harbor, other JLA members try to talk to Snapper Carr's family in an attempt to understand why Snapper would have turned to crime. Janet Carr bitterly tells the heroes that Snapper was unable to attend college or find employment because of his past association with the Justice League, and had been living a life of misery and poverty. As Janet spoke to them, the Star-Tsar attacked Happy Harbor. But after seeing Janet, he broke off his attack and fled. The JLA members followed the Star-Tsar to the Key's hideout, but Snapper‚Äîdressed as the Star-Tsar‚Äîtried to warn them that they were falling into a trap. A second Star-Tsar appeared and incapacitated everyone. Later, this second Star-Tsar set off bombs in Washington, D.C., and threatened President Jimmy Carter with more explosions if he did not pay a ransom. In the Key's hideout, Snapper found himself imprisoned alongside the other JLAers. He told them how the Key found him, destitute and depressed, and offered to supply him with weapons and money if he attacked the JLA. Desperate to feel good about himself, Snapper agreed to participate in the Key's plan. Snapper said the Key, disguised as the Star-Tsar, must have attacked the embassy in Washington. Feeling remorse for attacking his friends, Snapper decided to expose the Key by attacking Happy Harbor (knowing full well that the JLA would easily track him). The JLA soon freed themselves, and discovered that the Key had suffered a horrible accident that left him with a doll-sized body but normal-sized head. The heroes deduced that since the Key could not run in his robotic, humanoid body, there must be a third Star-Tsar. The Red Tornado then exposed Mark Shaw as the third Star-Tsar. At the end of the story, Superman says he will not send Snapper Carr to jail, and has something else in mind for him.Justice League of America Vol. 1 #150 (January 1978). =Post-Star-Tsar= The Snapper Carr character made a number of appearances in The Superman Family comic book from 1978 to 1982. Superman gets Snapper at job at S.T.A.R. Labs, the fictional nonprofit research corporation devoted to creating high-tech weapons and prisons to handle various supervillain and alien menaces. Snapper surreptitiously stole the wreck of a Kryptonian space-sled in the story \\"Birthright of Power!\\",The Superman Family #187 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1978). and briefly appeared in the story \\"Kandor vs. Supergirl\\" as a witness at the trial of Supergirl. He helped defend her in the follow-on story by gathering letters of recommendation from Justice League members, and then was hired as an assistant by Supergirl's foster father, Fred Danvers.The Superman Family #189 (May‚ÄìJune 1978). Three issues later, he made a brief appearance in the Supergirl story \\"What Goes Up Can't Come Down\\"The Superman Family #192 (November‚ÄìDecember 1978). and its conclusion \\"The Gravity War\\".The Superman Family #193 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1979). At the end of \\"Nightmare in New Athens\\", Snapper is shown to have used the space-sled to fix a Superboy robot, but a disembodied intelligence takes control of the android.The Superman Family #194 (March‚ÄìApril 1979). In \\"The Screamin' Demon\\", readers learn that student teacher Paul French has tried to wipe the memories of his criminal past by developing a \\"transistorized brain\\". Somehow, it all went wrong, and while he slept his unconscious mind seized control of the robot. (Supergirl briefly battled the robot before Paul woke.)The Superman Family #195 (May‚ÄìJune 1979). The Snapper Carr character also played a role in the resignation of Green Arrow from the JLA. The story, which is told in flashback, depicted Black Canary and Green Arrow investigating an explosion at the Star City Museum. They were attacked by the Star-Tsar, felled, and hospitalized. Snapper Carr, who just happened to be in Star City, arrives at the hospital to tell them that his Star-Tsar suit was stolen from the Metropolis police by an astronomer named Richard Rigel, who was working on technology powered by starlight. Green Arrow manages to stop the new Star-Tsar by deducing where he will attack next, but not before blundering members of the JLA almost allow the villain to kill thousands of people. In disgust at the JLA's conduct, Green Arrow resigned from the Justice League.Justice League of America Vol. 1 #181 (August 1980). Writer Gerry Conway brought Snapper Carr back to the Justice League for the comic book's 200th issue. A post-hypnotic suggestion makes the League's original seven members try to reassemble the seven Appellaxian meteorites from the 1962 adventure and use them to clone new Appellaxians who will initiate a second invasion of Earth. Snapper Carr waits with superhero Firestorm aboard the JLA Satellite, while the other heroes successfully battle the aliens.Justice League of America Vol. 1 #200 (March 1982). The Snapper Carr character appeared again in 1999 in the comic book Legends of the DC Universe. In the fictional character chronology, this story occurs some time after Green Arrow's 1980 resignation from the Justice League, but before Green Arrow rejoins the League in 1982. In this story (\\"Critical Mass Stages 1-5\\"/\\"Critical Mass Stages 6-16\\"), Snapper witnesses five JLA members growing to monstrous size. He believes this is a side-effect of a long-ago attack by a minor villain named Packrat. Snapper finds Green Arrow, who locates Packrat's shrink ray and restores the heroes to their correct size. As Snapper departs, Green Arrow tells the boy that he needs to forgive himself.Legends of the DC Universe #12 (January 1999); Legends of the DC Universe #13 (February 1999). =The Blasters= In 1989, DC Comics published a three-issue limited series titled Invasion! The Dominators, an alien race usually seen in the Legion of Super-Heroes comics, decide to invade Earth to learn the secret of the metagene‚Äîa gene that can give certain human beings superpowers. In the first issue of Invasion!, it is revealed that thousands of Earthlings have been kidnapped and taken to the Dominator homeworld, where they are forced to run a gauntlet of horrific, deadly traps and experiments known as \\"the Blaster\\". Six humans, including Snapper Carr, survive the Blaster, an indication that they have the metagene. Indeed, the Blaster itself forces the metagene in each person to manifest, and Snapper gains the ability to teleport whenever he snaps his fingers.Invasion! #1 (January 1989). In the third issue, these six new heroes are transferred to Starlag, the Dominator prison-world. There, they meet up with the extraterrestrial superhero team the Omega Men. They also meet Brainiac 2 and his super-team, the Licensed Extra-Governmental Interstellar Operatives Network (L.E.G.I.O.N.). Together, the three groups break out of Starlag and flee aboard a shuttle piloted by the feline alien, Churljenkins. They run into a superhero task force led by Superman, and assist in the invasion of the Dominator homeworld. There, they discover a cure for the Dominators' \\"gene bomb\\" (a device which accelerates metagene activity and destabilizes superpowers, ending with the death of the person with the metagene). Snapper and his group, now called the Blasters, return to Earth while Churljenkins joins the Omega Men and flies off into space.Invasion! #3 (March 1989). The Snapper Carr character next appeared in a one-off comic, Blasters. The story in this comic book begins with Snapper Carr in an alien insane asylum. Snapper had decided to keep his eyes open during a teleport, to see what occurs. Unfortunately, he witnessed an eternity of time passing, and was driven temporarily insane. The reader also learns that each of the Blasters has had trouble adjusting to their new superpowers, and are also incarcerated in the asylum. Snapper escapes by teleporting directly to Churljenkins' ship, which had broken down on an alien world. Churljenkins restores Snapper's sanity, and the two of them repair the ship and flee‚Äîstranding the Omega Men. They learn that the Dominators have destroyed Churljenkins' home planet, so they return to Earth. On the journey there, they discover that the Spider Guild (an alien race of humanoid arachnids) has created a weapons depot near Earth. Snapper breaks the Blasters out of the hospital, and the team destroys the depot.Blasters Special (March 1989). Valor and the loss of Snapper's hands The Snapper Carr character next appeared in the comic book Valor. The planet Daxam had helped the Dominators invade Earth, but were convinced by Superman to switch sides. Daxamites, a sub-species of Kryptonian, also gain superpowers under a yellow sun, and this vast army of supermen helped turn the tide and save Earth. The father of Lar Gand (later named Mon-el) died during this battle. Deciding to honor his father, Lar Gand becomes a superhero, joins L.E.G.I.O.N., and meets Superman‚Äîwho gives him the name Valor. Snapper Carr's involvement in the Valor story begins after Valor is accidentally imprisoned on Starlag II, a Dominator prison-world with a red sun. Valor signals for help, and his artificial intelligence unit sends for the Blasters. By this time, the Blasters had a number of adventures (none of them depicted in the comic book, just mentioned by the characters) which had turned out poorly, and were about to disband. While rescuing Valor, the team accidentally releases the energy being known as The Unimaginable.Valor #5 (March 1993); Valor #6 (April 1993). Valor and the Blasters battle The Unimaginable,Valor #7 (May 1993). and Valor escapes Starlag II. The Blasters, however, become trapped there.Valor #8 (June 1993). Some time thereafter, Snapper Carr and the Blasters are able to escape Starlag II, but Snapper becomes separated from his friends. (Their escape, and how Snapper became separated from them, is not depicted in any comic.) In stories first published in 2000, but occurring in the character's chronology at a point after the adventure with Valor, Snapper finds himself being pursued by the Khunds, an aggressive alien race from the Legion of Super-Heroes comic books. Snapper is captured, and his fingers are locked together to prevent him from teleporting. Snapper mulls over his past, and concludes that he has always been a disappointment‚Äîfirst to the Justice League, then to the Blasters. The Khunds torture Snapper, then cut off his hands‚Äîdepriving him of the ability to teleport. (Snapper Carr later tells Hourman that this is the worst moment in his life.)Hourman #20 (November 2000). At some point soon thereafter, Snapper Carr is reunited with Brainiac 2 on the planet Cairn, where Brainiac gives him new hands. Unfortunately, Snapper still cannot teleport.Hourman #21 (December 2000). =Hourman= The character of Snapper Carr is a main character in the Hourman comic book, which was published from April 1999 to April 2001. Throughout the comic book's run, a running gag depicts Snapper wearing a series of T-shirts, each emblazoned with a different superhero's logo or uniform colors. In this comic book, Hourman III is an android from the 853rd century. He was built by Tyler ChemoRobotics, a company founded by Hourman II (Rick Tyler) in the late 20th century. Hourman III traveled permanently to the 20th century, which is the one place he believed he could grow and evolve as a lifeform. He joined the Justice League, and at one point accessed all of Batman's memories of the League. These memories made Hourman III realize that Snapper Carr would be a good \\"humanity coach\\". The reader learns that, after having his hands restored, Snapper returned to Earth. He married and was divorced by a young woman named Bethany Lee (whose mother is the Happy Harbor chief of police). Snapper is depicted spending most of his time at a trendy if run-down Happy Harbor coffeehouse, the Mad Yak Caf√©, and caring for his pet cat, whom he has named Starro. Throughout the run of Hourman, Snapper is subjected to a wide range of horrors and bad experiences. Snapper is turned into an android by Amazo after Amazo gains the ability to not just capture a person's super-powers but their humanity as well. Starro is injured, and Hourman reverses the \\"humanization\\" effect.Hourman #6 (September 1999). In a tie-in to the \\"Day of Judgment\\" cross-over and one-off, Snapper fantasizes about two alternative futures‚Äîone in which he never betrays the Justice League and becomes a super-hero, and one in which he betrays them and becomes a washed-up alcoholic. Snapper is able to deduce that demons are harassing him and his friends, causing these fantasies, and he not only gets rid of the demons but convinces one of them to reject evil and become good by (feeding it cheesecake).Hourman #8 (November 1999). Shortly thereafter, Snapper Carr and his friends are accidentally trapped aboard Hourman's timeship for months, nearly going insane.Hourman #11 (February 2000); Hourman #12 (March 2000); Hourman #13 (April 2000). After being freed, Snapper is kidnapped by demons and tortured for several days,Hourman #14 (May 2000). but is freed by Hourman.Hourman #15 (June 2000). Snapper is shown suffering from severe depression after this experience. Hourman asks Snapper to tell him about his time with the Justice League, and in flashback Snapper relates the events of Justice League of America #77. The reader learns that Snapper regrets quitting the Justice League, and that Bethany divorced him because Snapper felt he wasn't good enough for her. Hourman says that Snapper fights for the common man, and that's what people like about him. This lifts Snapper out of his depression. Amazo returns and appears to kill Snapper Carr.Hourman #19 (October 2000). The reader learns, however, that Snapper is not dead but back in time, caught in a loop where he is forced to relive the loss of his hands over and over. Hourman merges his body with Amazo's, and is able to retrieve Snapper from the time-loop. Realizing he's learned as much about being human as he can, Hourman decides to return to the 853rd century. He takes Snapper and his other friends aboard the timeship for some travel and fun,Hourman #22 (January 2001). but Hourman suddenly vanishes from the craft and it crashes on an asteroid. After a few days pass, Hourman returns to the timeship, drops Snapper and his friends off at Happy Harbor, and leaves.Hourman #25 (April 2001). =Young Justice= The character of Snapper Carr next has a major recurring role in the comic book Young Justice. The T-shirt running gag begun in Hourman continues in Young Justice. Young Justice is a group of superheroes composed of teenagers and young adults. Initially, the group was mentored by the Red Tornado. However, in Young Justice #38, the super-fast hero known as Impulse (Bart Allen) decides to leave the group to live a life away from super-heroics. Robin (Tim Drake) resigns, too, feeling no one trusts him. Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark) asks Red Tornado for help, and he persuades Snapper Carr to provide daily oversight of the group.Young Justice #38 (December 2001). Snapper Carr appears irregularly over the remaining publication history of Young Justice. He appeared in issues #39, #40, and #41,Young Justice #39 (January 2002); Young Justice #40 (February 2002); Young Justice #41 (March 2002). but not in issues #42, #43, #44, or #45.Young Justice #42 (April 2002); Young Justice #43 (May 2002); Young Justice #44 (June 2002); Young Justice #45 (July 2002). Snapper reappeared in issues #46 and #47,Young Justice #46 (August 2002); Young Justice #47 (September 2002). but wasn't in issue #48.Young Justice #48 (October 2002). He returned in issue #49,Young Justice #49 (November 2002). did not appear in issue #50,Young Justice #50 (December 2002). and returned again in issue #51.Young Justice #51 (January 2003). Snapper Carr appeared in the remaining issues of Young Justice, which ended its publication run with issue #55.Young Justice #52 (February 2003); Young Justice #53 (March 2003); Young Justice #54 (April 2003); Young Justice #55 (May 2003). During and after Snapper Carr's run in Young Justice, the character appeared in cameos three times in other comic books. The first appearance was when he attended Green Arrow's funeral.Green Arrow Vol. 3 #16 (October 2002). The second appearance showed him hanging out with the Justice League during a meeting with the Avengers from Marvel Comics.Avengers/JLA #3 (December 2003). The third appearance was when he attended Green Arrow's wedding to Black Canary. In this last outing, Snapper's invitation to the wedding is stolen and restolen by a host of villains, but Snapper manages to attend the event all the same.Green Arrow/Black Canary: Wedding Special (November 2007). =Checkmate= DC Comics rebooted their comic universe in 1985 and 1986 in the crossover event \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", again in \\"Zero Hour: Crisis in Time\\" in 1994, again in \\"Infinite Crisis\\" in 2005 and 2006, again in \\"Final Crisis\\" in 2008, and yet again in \\"Flashpoint\\" and \\"The New 52\\" in 2011. The initial reboot was intended to resolve continuity problems which had crept into the DC Comics universe over the past 50 years, and the subsequent reboots were to correct problems created by \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" (although, in some cases, they worsened them). During the build-up to \\"Infinite Crisis\\", DC Comics published a limited series titled Identity Crisis. Batman is surprised to discover that many supervillains have gained access to the JLA Satellite, the Justice League Watchtower (a base on the moon), and (after the Watchtower's destruction) the new JLA Satellite. Worse, many villains have learned the secret identity of a wide range of heroes. Zatanna, a sorceress and Justice League member, has (with the consent of nearly all members of the League) been wiping the memories of these villains. Batman, who opposed this decision, also had his memories wiped.Identity Crisis #1 (June 2004); Identity Crisis #2 (July 2004); Identity Crisis #3 (August 2004); Identity Crisis #4 (September 2004); Identity Crisis #5 (October 2004); Identity Crisis #6 (November 2004); Identity Crisis #7 (December 2004). In May 2005, comic book readers learn that Batman has designed and constructed an artificial intelligence and placed it aboard a satellite called Brother MK I, nicknamed \\"Brother Eye\\". The purpose of Brother Eye is to keep track of superhero activities in case Batman's memories are wiped again. Unfortunately, the hero-turned-villain Alexander Luthor, Jr. gives the satellite sentience and Maxwell Lord, leader of the government agency Checkmate, takes control of it.Countdown to Infinite Crisis (May 2005). Lord secretly alters millions of people around the globe with Checkmate technology, turning them into \\"Observational Metahuman Activity Constructs\\" (OMACs)‚Äîsuperpowered creatures which will do Lord's bidding. Brother Eye frames Wonder Woman for Lord's death and then unleashes a quarter million OMACs against the world's heroes.The OMAC Project #1 (June 2005); The OMAC Project #2 (July 2005); The OMAC Project #3 (August 2005); The OMAC Project #4 (September 2005); The OMAC Project #5 (October 2005); The OMAC Project #6 (November 2005). Brother Eye is eventually defeated, although hundreds of thousands of people still have OMAC technology within their bodies. It is later revealed the Snapper Carr joined Checkmate during the OMAC crisis.52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen #3 (December 2007). The \\"Infinite Crisis\\" crossover event that concluded in 2006 was immediately followed by a major DC Comics event known as \\"One Year Later\\". \\"One Year Later\\" was designed to explore the major continuity changes created by \\"Infinite Crisis\\". With Superman and Batman apparently dead and Wonder Woman retired, \\"One Year Later\\" also examined how the world coped without its three biggest superheroes. It was followed chronologically by 52, a one-comic-a-week publication that covered the \\"missing year\\" between the end of \\"Infinite Crisis\\" and \\"One Year Later\\". In the fictional timeline of the DC Comics universe, 52 came between \\"Infinite Crisis\\" and \\"One Year Later\\". 52 included several one-off and limited series comic books. One of these limited series was the six-part comic book 52: Aftermath. 52 had established the existence of the Science Squad, a group of supervillain mad scientists based in the nation of Oolong Island (which is ruled by evil superscientist Veronica Cale). The Science Squad unleashes the Four Horsemen of Apokolips‚ÄîYurrd (famine), Rogga (war), Zorrm (pestilence), and Azraeuz (death). These bioengineered beings were created specifically to attack the Black Marvel Family, rulers of the Middle Eastern nation of Kahndaq. In 52 #43 through #50 and expanded upon in the four issues of the limited series World War III, Black Adam's lover, the superheroine Isis, dies after being infected by Zorrm, and Yurrd eats her brother, Osiris. Black Adam goes mad with rage and grief and announces he will kill every single human being on the planet. He then commits genocide, murdering all the people in the fictional Middle Eastern nation of Bialya (where he believes the Four Horsemen originated). After being briefly imprisoned by the Science Squad, Black Adam is freed by his friend Atom Smasher (who mistakenly doesn't believe Black Adam capable of genocide) and slaughters hundreds of thousands of people in Italy and China. Black Adam is finally stopped by Captain Marvel.52 #43 (February 2007).52 #44 (March 2007); 52 #45 (March 2007); 52 #46 (March 2007); 52 #47 (March 2007); 52 #48 (April 2007); 52 #49 (April 2007); 52 #40 (April 2007); World War III #1 (April 2007); World War III #2 (April 2007); World War III #3 (April 2007); World War III #4 (April 2007). The Four Horsemen are not dead, however. They return almost immediately in a new limited series comic book, 52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen, which began publication in November 2007 (six months after the events of 52 and World War III). In this story, the spirits of the bioengineered beings survived their destruction by Black Adam and fled to the former nation of Bialya, where millions of bodies lay unburied. Veronica Cale (hoping to regain control of the beings) secretly gives them \\"morphogenetic technology\\" to make their bodies more adaptable to Earth and less capable of being destroyed. Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman arrive in Bialya in time to see the Four Horsemen constructing new bodies from the millions of corpses lying around them. The Snapper Carr character appears at the end of the second issue,52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen #2 (November 2007). where he is shown monitoring the three heroes for Checkmate. Snapper reveals himself to the heroes in the third issue, and explains that he not only joined Checkmate during the OMAC crisis but has been secretly monitoring the Justice League's activities since the dissolution of Young Justice. Superman is angered by this and demands an end to Snapper's spying, but Batman argues that Snapper can help in case the battle against the Four Horsemen does not go well. Things don't go well, and Superman rescues Batman and Snapper from an advancing army of zombies resurrected by Azraeuz. Superman is infected by Zorrm, and Batman voices concern for him. Snapper Carr blithely tells him that \\"Clark can take care of himself\\", and Batman slaps him for pretending an over-friendly familiarity with a hero he barely knows.52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen #4 (January 2008). In the fourth issue of the limited series, Mister Terrific, one of the four heads of Checkmate, arrives on Oolong Island. He teleports Snapper, Superman, and Batman out of Bialya and to Oolong Island, where he tells the heroes that the Science Squad is alarmed that the Four Horsemen remain out of their control. The villains, he says, are now attempting to build a device to contain them, and Checkmate is assisting that effort. Snapper is present when Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman defeat the Four Horsemen, and is left behind on the island by the heroes when they leave.52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen #6 (March 2008). =Final Crisis: Resist= From 2007 to 2008, DC Comics published the Death of the New Gods eight-issue limited series. In this comic book, all of the New Gods are killed, the planets New Genesis and Apokolips merge, and the Fourth World dimension ceases to exist in favor of a new \\"Fifth World\\" dimension.Death of the New Gods #1 (December 2007); Death of the New Gods #2 (December 2007); Death of the New Gods #3 (January 2008); Death of the New Gods #4 (February 2008); Death of the New Gods #5 (March 2008); Death of the New Gods #6 (April 2008); Death of the New Gods #7 (May 2008); Death of the New Gods #8 (June 2008). In May 2007, even as 52 was still being published, DC Comics began publishing the 52-issue, one-comic-per-week Countdown comic book (later known as Countdown to Final Crisis). It premiered with issue #51 (issues were numbered in reverse order),Countdown #51 (May 2007). changed its name to Countdown to Final Crisis midway through its publication run, and concluded with DC Universe #0 (also known as Countdown to Final Crisis #0).DC Universe #0 (June 2008). This set in motion yet another reboot of the DC Comics universe, \\"Final Crisis.\\" There was a seven-issue Final Crisis limited series,Final Crisis #1 (July 2008); Final Crisis #2 (August 2008); Final Crisis #3 (September 2008); Final Crisis #4 (November 2008); Final Crisis #5 (December 2008); Final Crisis #6 (January 2009); Final Crisis #7 (March 2009. six crossover stories,Justice League of America Vol. 2 #21 (July 2008); Batman #682 (January 1, 2009], Batman #683 (January 15, 2009); Batman #701 (September 2010); Batman #702 (October 2010); Superman/Batman #76 (November 2010). a one-off,DC Universe: Last Will and Testament (October 2008). and 10 Final Crisis spin-off titles (some of them one-shots, some of them limited series).Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #1 (August 2008); Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #2 (November 2008); Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #3 (April 2009); Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #4 (June 2009; Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5 (September 2009); Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns (October 2008); Final Crisis: Requiem (September 2008); Final Crisis: Revelations (October 2008); Final Crisis: Revelations (November 2008); Final Crisis: Revelations (December 2008); Final Crisis: Revelations (January 2009); Final Crisis: Revelations (February 2009); Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge #1 (September 2008); Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge #2 (October 2008); Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge #3 (November 2008); Final Crisis: Secret Files (February 2009); Final Crisis: Sketchbook (July 2008); Final Crisis: Submit (December 2008); Final Crisis: Superman Beyond #1 (October 2008); Final Crisis: Superman Beyond #2 (March 2009).Final Crisis: Resist (December 2008). The \\"Final Crisis\\" event storyline begins with Darkseid's death, and his spirit and the spirit of all the Apokoliptian New Gods falling to Earth. This somehow creates a quantum singularity that will consume all creation. The supervillain Libra, who became a New God after his 1974 battle with the Justice LeagueJustice League of America Vol. 1 #111 (June 1974); Justice League of America Vol. 1 #112 (August 1974). and somehow escaped the death of the New Gods, seizes control of a large number of nations and organizations on Earth on behalf of Darkseid. Darkseid obtains a new body, and releases the Anti-Life Equation (a metaphysical virus which allows Darkseid to control the mind of anyone it infects). After a month, nearly all the people of Earth are under Darkseid's control. So are most superheroes and supervillains, whom Darkseid organizes into a terrorist unit called \\"Justifiers\\". Darkseid is eventually defeated, and the universe rebooted by Superman (using a Miracle Machine from the 31st century). The one-off publication Final Crisis: Resist features Snapper Carr. It begins the same day the Anti-Life Equation is released, and the events in the story take place over the next few days. In the book's opening pages, Snapper is shown to be at Checkmate's headquarters in Antarctica. While nearly all Checkmate staff, heroes, and villains are infected with Anti-Life, a few barricade themselves inside the compound, which is protected by force fields. Snapper, whose teleportation abilities have now remanifested (how is not explained in the story), spends the first few days after the release of Anti-Life teleporting around the globe disrupting Darkseid's hold on various scientific organizations. But supplies are almost nonexistent at the Checkmate base. After several days, Snapper teleports to France to seek food for the Checkmate hold-outs. He is attacked by the Anti-Life-infected hero Firehawk, but the supervillain Cheetah knocks Firehawk unconscious. A few days later, Snapper teleports to a hospital in the United States to find medical supplies. He is sickened to see children being infected with Anti-Life. He discovers Cheetah in an empty medical ward of the hospital, bandaging an injury. Cheetah reacts to Snapper's presence by seducing him, and they make love. Cheetah tells Snapper she is impressed by his physical endowment and love-making skills. Their post-coital interlude is interrupted by the Justifier Gorilla Grodd. Snapper teleports himself and Cheetah to Checkmate headquarters, but the strain of teleporting another person (which he is doing for the first time) burns out his teleportation power. The one-off comic book ends with Mister Terrific activating OMACs worldwide to help defeat Darkseid. The final panels of the publication show Snapper leading a charge of OMACs, Mister Terrific, Cheetah, and the remaining Checkmate staff in a charge out of the bunker. =Battle against Epoch= The last appearance of the Snapper Carr character (as of 2015) occurred in 2009 in Justice League of America 80-Page Giant. In this story, Snapper Carr is biding his time at the Secret Sanctuary in Happy Harbor, and summons Cheetah for some romance and perhaps sex. Their tryst is interrupted by the appearance of the supervillain known as Time Commander (who had recently battled Hourman II).JSA Classified #34 (March 2008). Time Commander claims that his grandmother is about to be born today, and that the supervillain Epoch (formerly known as the Lord of Time, and an old JLA enemy) wants to kill the infant so that Time Commander will never be born. Epoch, he says, is already in the hospital and searching for the child. Furthermore, Epoch is also trying to kill the Justice League by attacking them when they were children. Time Commander has already scattered the JLA through time in an attempt to stop Epoch from carrying out his plans. (If the Justice League never survives infancy, they will not form the League and Snapper Carr will not be around to help Time Commander.) Most of the issue follows the adventures of six teams, composed of one or more League members, as they try to stop Epoch at various points in the past. At the end of the issue, Snapper persuades Cheetah to help by distracting Epoch so Snapper can teleport into the hospital, grab Epoch, and then teleport himself and Epoch back outside. Having done so, Snapper then grabs Epoch's \\"time gauntlet\\" and teleports to the side of the Time Commander‚Äîwith Epoch's forearm and hand in his grasp. (The re-emergence of Snapper's teleportation powers is not explained in the story.) With Epoch's technology (and limb) stolen, the attack in the past ceases. The JLA reappear and quickly subdue Epoch. Cheetah, Snapper, and Time Commander bid goodbye to the newborn grandmother in the hospital, and Time Commander takes Epoch to the Timepoint (a frozen moment in time that serves as a prison). In the story's final panels, Cheetah reveals that the baby isn't Time Commander's grandmother (a fact she can sense using her fertility powers). Snapper realizes he's been duped: The Time Commander merely wanted to distract Snapper so that he could steal Hourman's hourglass-shaped time-travel device from the JLA trophy case.Justice League of America 80-Page Giant Vol. 2 #1 (November 2009). =Dial H for Hero= Snapper Carr makes an appearance in the 2019 run of Dial H for Hero. The H-Dial (which can turn a person into a wide range of super-powered beings) is found by Miguel Montez. The H-Dial proves to be addictive, so that anyone who has used it in the past now craves to possess and use it. The mysterious villain Mister Thunderbolt is one of these seeking the device.Dial H for Hero #1 (March 2019). Miguel and his friend, Summer Pickens, arrive at the Justice League's Detroit headquarters and meet Snapper Carr, who is managing robotic doubles of the Justice League. As Snapper Carr tries to contact the Hall of Justice, Mister Thunderbolt programs the robots to attack Miguel, Summer, and Snapper. Using the H-Dial, Summer transforms into Chimp Change, Snapper turns into Alien Ice Cream Man, and Miguel turns into Lil' Miguelito. As Chimp Change and Alien Ice Cream Man subdue the robots, Mister Thunderbolt tricks Miguel into dialing \\"S\\" for Sockamagee. This releases Mister Thunderbolt from his prison.

Between 1989 and 1998, the band released four studio albums and numerous EPs and singles despite a considerable flux of members, managers, and record labels. By 1993 the band‚Äôs lineup had settled with Franklin on vocals/guitar, Hartridge on guitar, Jez Hindmarsh on drums, and Steve George on bass. They had emerged with a heavier rock sound than their shoegaze contemporaries, and over the next five years it evolved to include elements of psychedelia, classic pop, and indie rock. Record label issues and waning interest within the group led to their split at the end of 1998. A decade later, Swervedriver reunited and toured periodically over the next five years, releasing their first new material in fifteen years with the 2013 single \\"Deep Wound\\". They have since released two full-length albums, I Wasn't Born to Lose You in 2015 and Future Ruins in 2019, with touring stand-ins drummer Mikey Jones and bassist Mick Quinn permanently joining the band. History =Early years (1984‚Äì1989)= Swervedriver have their roots in Oxford when schoolmates and aspiring guitarists Franklin and Hartridge along with Franklin's older brother and vocalist, Graham, and drummer Paddy Pulzer formed the band Shake Appeal in 1984. In 1987, bass player Adrian \\"Adi\\" Vines, from Yorkshire, joined the band, and the following year they released their solitary single \\"Gimme Fever\\" through Notown Records. Shake Appeal were influenced by late '60s garage rock bands like The Stooges and MC5, drawing similar influences from the sights and sounds of the British Leyland car factory Franklin and Hartridge walked past every day on the way to school. When influence turned to emulation, the members felt they needed to develop a sound of their own. They had meanwhile turned their attention to American alternative rock acts H√ºsker D√º, Sonic Youth, and Dinosaur Jr., and subsequently were inspired \\"to push out the boundaries of electric guitar within a pop format.\\" In 1989, after Shake Appeal disbanded, Adam Franklin composed the songs \\"Volcano Trash\\", \\"Afterglow\\", and \\"Son of Mustang Ford\\" (which would become Swerverdriver's first single). The former band mates were impressed with his work and assembled at Union Street Studios in Oxford to record a demo, with Adam Franklin shifting to lead vocals and his brother singing backup. Soon thereafter, Graham Franklin and Pulzer left the band to pursue other musical interests. Growing tired of the local scene, the group had decided to head to London, and there they met drummer and Edinburgh-native Graham Bonnar, formerly of the post-punk band The Shattered Family. Before leaving Oxford, they had handed their demo to Mark Gardener of local band Ride, who in turn passed it on to Alan McGee of Creation Records. McGee signed them almost immediately after listening to the tape (while driving around downtown Los Angeles in the back of a limousine) and Swervedriver was born. =Debut EPs, Raise, and departures (1990‚Äì1992)= Instead of debuting with a full-length album, Swervedriver released a series of four-track EPs over the span of a year, subscribing to the popular trend in the early '90s. \\"If you had 4 songs ready-ish, you would record them there and then and put them all out ASAP. No such thing as 'saving songs for the album' back then,\\" explained Hartridge. The tracks were recorded at The Greenhouse & Falconer Studios in London and were all produced by the band. Swervedriver's debut offering, Son of Mustang Ford, was released on 16 July 1990 and included the song \\"Kill the Superheroes\\", one of Franklin's first attempts at writing in an alternate tuning. Franklin stated in NME, \\"Son of Mustang Ford was based on the Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas idea ‚Äì driving around, out of your box, over America's landscapes.\\" The EP was characterized as \\"a chromium-plated piece of automobile romanticism.\\" The group launched the release with an appearance on the John Peel BBC Radio 1 show on 31 July 1990, performing a select B-side from each of their three debut EPs along with the song \\"Over\\" (which would not see an official release for 15 years). The release of Rave Down, the second EP in the series, followed in November. Mary Anne Hobbs called its title track \\"a cyclone of wild, swollen riff machinery that sounds like it's been played with dislocated shoulder joints.\\" Both EPs received favorable reviews and their title singles made their way into the UK indie and metal charts. However, mainstream British music press soon shifted their focus to bands who fit easier into the shoegazer mould. The group began gaining popularity in the United States, and in early 1991 Swervedriver signed with American label A&M; Records and went on their first US tour, a brief run of shows in support of Ned's Atomic Dustbin that kicked off at the Marquee in New York City. On 22 July 1991, their third EP, Sandblasted, was released with the title single reaching number 67 on the UK chart and being described as \\"a head-on collision between guitars raging for chaos.\\" Swervedriver released their debut album, Raise, on 30 September 1991. It was recorded at The Greenhouse & Falconer Studios and produced by the band, like their prior EPs, and included the title tracks from all three. Regarding the group's overriding fascination with everything automotive, Franklin had said, \\"the car thing came from twisting around rock 'n' roll imagery. Chuck Berry used to sing about cars. T. Rex used to sing about cars, and being in the car is just a good place to hear music.\\" The album was praised as \\"incurably romantic, [getting] its rocks off\\" as one of the \\"truly great albums made this year\\" and charted 44th in the UK. Swervedriver toured the UK extensively in support of the album and was invited to a second BBC Radio 1 session on 23 November 1991. Producer Alan Moulder, who had worked with fellow Creation acts The Jesus and Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine, introduced himself to Franklin at a bar at the University of North London's ULU music venue with the interest of working together. Moulder met the band at Greenhouse studios and there they recorded Never Lose That Feeling, Swervedriver's fourth EP, which featured the Raise outtake \\"The Watchmakers Hands\\" and the track \\"Scrawl and Scream\\", a slowed-down reworking of \\"Afterglow\\". Swervedriver then embarked on a proper headlining tour of North America with American indie rock act Poster Children opening. On 6 February 1992, while waiting to cross the Canada‚ÄìUS border for a show in Toronto, Bonnar left the tour bus to \\"go get a sandwich\\" and did not come back. Despite having fully intended to complete the tour, artistic differences between band members made it impossible for him to continue. After he spoke to Hartridge, Bonnar told him he wanted out of the band. Dan Davis from Run Westy Run filled in for the next five dates, and then tour manager Phil Ames called on Danny Ingram from Washington, D.C. band Strange Boutique to finish the tour. The group, with Ingram in tow, returned to the US in April 1992 to support A&M; label mates Monster Magnet and Soundgarden and then performed a short stint in Japan. Before departing on their second leg, they had mixed Never Lose That Feeling which was released on 18 May 1992; the Moulder production would be Swervedriver's final release with the original lineup. Hartridge viewed the title track's riff as \\"a bit of a bridge between Raise and Mezcal Head in some ways\\" and the song would reach number 62 on the UK charts. Using footage from their first leg of touring, A&M; representatives Jeff Suhy and Scott Carter produced the video On the Road with Swervedriver: A Rockumentary, which also featured interviews and the music videos for \\"Son of Mustang Ford\\" and \\"Sandblasted\\", and released it on 14 May 1992. Just as they started to experience a rise in success, Swervedriver would hit another roadblock‚Äîin addition to them losing their manager, following a performance at the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden on 8 August 1992, Vines left to form heavy metal-oriented Skyscraper. Having already suffered the loss of Bonnar, the loss of Vines, whom some considered the face of the band, led music press to believe it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the band to sustain their momentum. =Mezcal Head and new lineup (1993‚Äì1994)= Ultimately all that remained of the band according to Franklin was, \\"myself, Jimmy Hartridge and some effects pedals\\", though Moulder still anticipated producing a full- length Swervedriver album. Franklin and Hartridge laid the groundwork for a new album at EMI's demoing studio near Oxford Street in London, and while recording newly written \\"Duress\\" with producer Marc Waterman, he introduced them to Jeremy \\"Jez\\" Hindmarsh, ex-drummer of the London band 5:30. (Waterman had produced their first album.) Later that night, Hindmarsh approached the duo at The Murray Arms bar in Camden Town and pitched them his services, including use of his 16-track studio equipment. They accepted and Swervedriver had their new drummer. The group got to work on recording their new album first at Playground rehearsal studios in Camden and then Trident 2 studios in Strutton Ground in Westminster, with Franklin and Hartridge splitting bass duties. Swervedriver would still need a bassist when the show hit the road, and Franklin would encounter him at another bar in Camden. About meeting Essex-native Steve George, Franklin recalled, \\"He actually came up to me and said, 'You‚Äôre the guy from Swervedriver. You need a bass player. I‚Äôm your man.'\\" On 12 August 1993, the band released their second album, Mezcal Head, produced by Alan Moulder and Swervedriver. Franklin and Hartridge credited Moulder for making the album sound \\"big and clear\\" and doing \\"way more for us than we had hoped for.\\" The album debuted at number 55 in the UK and was critically acclaimed‚ÄîNME asserted, \\"you are defied not to sit back, ride its massive cadences, revel in its classical form and sleek lines, and... fall helplessly in love.\\" Later reviews praised it \\"combined the best elements of shoegazing with grunge and even American indie rock\\" and \\"really is the lost classic of the shoegaze movement.\\" Its first single, \\"Duel\\", garnered both NME's and Melody Maker's \\"Single of the Week\\" and hit number 60 on the UK chart (their highest charting single to date). The band shot two videos for the single: a self-produced snowboarding excursion at Mount Hood and a big- budget MTV effort set in downtown Los Angeles, which included new bassist George. Swervedriver set off touring for the album in the UK and then moved to North America in late 1993 to join Shudder to Think and The Smashing Pumpkins, solidifying a strong American following in the process. In early 1994 the album's second single, \\"Last Train to Satansville\\", was released. Critics and fans alike were drawn to Hindmarsh's deeper, harder-hitting drumming and Franklin's stream-of-consciousness narrative, describing it as \\"the height of alt-rock badassery ... with a monster guitar riff and chunky rhythm\\" and a \\"menacing spaghetti western bite.\\" The single, along with \\"Duel\\", would be featured with songs from other A&M; artists in the video game Road Rash for the 3DO system. Meanwhile, the group continued touring with fellow Creation act Medicine in Europe, Australia, and Japan. Later that year Swervedriver would put out their first single with George on bass, the \\"limited edition export series, deleted on day of release\\" 8-track recording, \\"My Zephyr\\", on boutique label The Flower Shop. =Ejector Seat Reservation and label troubles (1995)= Bassist Steve George performing with Swervedriver in 2011. Swervedriver's third album, Ejector Seat Reservation, was recorded primarily at Church Studios and Konk Studios in Crouch End, North London and again produced by the band and Alan Moulder. Aside from themes of fatalism and flight working their way into its composition, \\"for some reason we were wanting to reverse the notion of being the band with the American references in our songs and so some very British reference points appeared in the lyrics,\\" explained Franklin. The band had a dispute with McGee over picking the album's launching single‚Äîthey thought \\"The Other Jesus\\" was the obvious choice but McGee overrode them, selecting \\"Last Day on Earth\\" in an attempt to capitalize on the current trend perpetuated by Britpop bands like Oasis of featuring strings and acoustic guitars. Initial promo pressings of the record including the additional track \\"It's All Happening Now\\" had to be withdrawn after permission to use lyrics lifted from Bob Dylan's \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" was denied. (They would later be given away to fan club members.) These incidents would prove to be just a precursor to the group's album woes, however. Realizing a vanishing return on their investment, American label A&M; cut the band's funding, telling them the album would not fit into their release schedule for another year and a half. In response, the group requested to be released from their contract. With its loss of the band's licensing to A&M; (approximately $350,000 per album), an already financially troubled Creation released Ejector Seat Reservation domestically on 15 July 1995 but dropped the band a week later. Subsequently, it received no promotional support (aside from a few small ads) and would remain unreleased in North America. Ejector Seat Reservation did get some press in mainland Europe (specifically France and Germany) and received significant support from licensee Sony Music in Australia, including an invitation for the group to tour the country at the end of the year, but that did not prevent it from becoming Swervedriver's poorest selling album. Despite its lack of commercial success, critics have considered Ejector Seat Reservation to be the band's highest achievement. Andy Kellman of AllMusic crowned it their \\"most cohesive and concise record, best experienced in whole,\\" which \\"Swervedriver effortlessly committed ... as if they had it in them all along.\\" Magnet magazine's Gil Gershman complimented it as the \\"work of artists enjoying a towering creative high\\" that \\"should have topped every chart and won legions over to the Swervedriver cause.\\" With the addition of George's deep grooves to the mix, melodic efforts like \\"The Birds\\", \\"How Does It Feel to Look Like Candy?\\", and \\"Last Day on Earth\\" saw Swervedriver branching out from their metallic roots and demonstrating their expanding influences in the likes of Elvis Costello, Burt Bacharach, and T. Rex. =99th Dream and breakup (1996‚Äì1998)= Swervedriver appeared to rebound when they signed a three-album deal with DGC Records (a subsidiary of Geffen Records) in early 1996. Originally, the first album in the deal was to be an American release of Ejector Seat Reservation; the band had attempted to talk A&M; into relinquishing them the rights, but after news of their talks with Geffen was publicized on the Internet, A&M; had come back with an exorbitant price for its sale (to avoid the same missed opportunity after previously dropped Soul Asylum hit it big with 1992's Grave Dancers Union). With their advance, they finished building their own recording studio, Bad Earth in Farringdon, and instead began work on a new record for the label. Over the next year, the group would record 99th Dream with Moulder at the helm, this time taking a more simple, laid-back approach than with previous productions. They scaled back from 48-track to 24-track recording, condensing the layering of guitar in the process, and employed more full-ensemble straight live track, partly with the mindset of making it easier to play the guitar lines live. During that time, the band also put out a pair of self-produced boutique label seven-inch singles, including the double split \\"Why Say Yeah\\" with indie collaboration act Sophia. DGC distributed promotional copies of the album and scheduled a release date of 7 May 1997. Meanwhile, in December 1996 Swervedriver went back into the studio and re-recorded the album track \\"These Times,\\" citing their growing dislike for the original's faster-paced, Oasis-like sound and a bad experience with one of the label's reps during mixing. Three and a half weeks before 99th Dream was due to be released, DGC dismissed the band's A&R; representative, Jody Kurilla, in a corporate downsizing and three hours later terminated their contract (though they would not impede the record's future release). Considering the recent break with their third label in two years, Hindmarsh stated, \\"Someone from A&M; once told us that it takes four or five listens to a Swervedriver album to see whether you like it or not, and in this marketplace, unless you can hit immediately it's not going to register with people.\\" Still determined to get the album out, Swervedriver forwent signing with one of two other interested major labels and instead opted for independent label Zero Hour Records out of New York. They officially released 99th Dream, their fourth album, on 24 February 1998. The band also formed their own label, Sonic Wave Discs (SWD), and on 10 August 1998 issued the album in the UK. About the album's progression to a more indie rock style, Franklin told The Star-Ledger, \\"It wasn't a conscious decision. [It was] just the way it was going ‚Äì concise little pop songs, bossa nova beats and such.\\" He continued, \\"I've always liked the idea that you don't always know where it's coming from... [The lyrics are] all about time. It's all over the place. I didn't put too much thought into it, which may be good. You're fueling more from the subconscious that way.\\" In an interview for Mean Street magazine, Hindmarsh mentioned, \\"There's a track called 'She Weaves a Tender Trap.' That's like a one-take, all-four-of-us thing, and it has a lot more air in it, a lot more space. Whereas in the past, we used to try and fill every single hole. That song sort of defines a change in the way we're thinking. I think we're headed that way, to leave space to let the music breathe a little bit.\\" Reviews of the album were mixed, mainly around the band's shift from the heavier, multi-layered composition of previous releases to a more acoustic, song-based sound that at times seemed disjointed. \\"Though the weakest of Swervedriver's four long-players of the '90s, 99th Dream still shimmers and sizzles like the work of shamefully few bands of the time,\\" asserted Andy Kellman of AllMusic. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly concurred: \\"The sheer heaviness of the old Swervies is much missed, but even on cruise control the band has a singular intensity, not to mention a sharp sense of songcraft.\\" Proponents of the release maintained it \\"mixes the tempos up with equal parts 'Brit' to 'rock,' blending into a nice mix\\" and \\"never makes grandiose rock and roll promises, only to let the listener down later.\\" Yet, not all reviews were favorable; NME lambasted the effort as an attempt \\"to bung some lazy-eyed melody swoons, Mexican twangs and comatose rock-outs over the trademark billowing whale flatulence,\\" and Drop-D Magazine opined, \\"The slow, druggy pace and fascination with their own weird noises work against them.\\" Swervedriver would spend the rest of the year touring extensively for the album. The band performed a promo gig opening for Hum on 26 February 1998 at Irving Plaza in New York and kicked off a North American stint in late May with acts such as Sianspheric, The Dandy Warhols, and Beck. The tour swung to the UK at the end of July, and discussions started within the band about a break: \\"it cropped up ‚Äì 'Is this fun? Are we having fun doing this?' I guess we kind of weren‚Äôt,\\" spoke Franklin in a 2011 interview. They ultimately decided to keep going until the end of the year, honoring their touring commitments, and then according to Franklin, \\"take a bit of a time out... although it did seem like the end, to me.\\" The group returned to the US to headline a nine-show club tour in the Northeast; they immediately followed with a wide-ranging Australian tour opening for Powderfinger, with their last show taking place at Bootleg Brewery in Margaret River near Perth on 13 December 1998. That year also saw the release of two more works through Swervedriver's personal label. The EP Space Travel, Rock 'n' Roll, released on 10 February 1998 as an Australian single, showcased Hindmarsh's first experimentation with looping. The 6 July 1998 single \\"Wrong Treats\\" (\\"These Times\\" in Australia) would be the band's last offering before their ultimate hiatus and featured the instrumental \\"Homeless Homecoming\\", a recording begun during a soundcheck at the Metro Club in Sydney, and a cover of T. Rex's \\"Ch√¢teau in Virginia Waters\\". =Hiatus and non-Swervedriver activity (1999‚Äì2007)= In addition to being burned out from the rest of their tour, the band members were growing tired of the encompassing drug scene at their studio space and had entertained selling Bad Earth Studio to Ash before the building lease ran out on them. As they closed down the studio and moved their gear out, the reality of an indefinite hiatus sunk in. Franklin embarked on a solo career that would come to rival his previous band's creative output, first as the experimental electronic pop/folk group Toshack Highway, whose releases ranged from six-piece ensemble works to four-track bedroom recordings, and then as a more traditionally guitar-driven solo artist, continuing to this day as Adam Franklin & Bolts of Melody. Hartridge went on to establish a distribution company. Hindmarsh turned to managing bands full- time under Badearth management, which he founded in March 1998, eventually contracting with Scottish rock band Terra Diablo. In the beginning of 2005, the group convened in a collaboration with Castle Music to decide on songs for a retrospective. Juggernaut Rides '89‚Äì'98 compiled 33 tracks remastered from the original DATs (almost half of which being non-album tracks) and was released on 14 March 2005. The two-CD anthology featured four previously unreleased songs, including Shake Appeal's \\"Son of Mustang Ford\\" demo from 1989 and the remainder of Swervedriver's 1998 recordings, \\"Just Sometimes\\" and the orchestral string accompanied \\"Neon Lights Glow\\". Regarding the production effort for Juggernaut Rides, Franklin told Tape Op magazine, \\"Me and Jimmy sat there [during the remastering] and said, 'Wow this is pretty great.' You do forget things about the various tracks,\\" and said to Australia's The Vine, \\"I quite like the fact that it‚Äôs not chronologically laid out, so you just jump straight into the middle.\\" Reviews touted it as \\"Swervedriver's beautiful corpse\\" and asserted that it \\"proves they were so much more than just another underachieving T-shirt band.\\" The following year on 24 November 2006, Hindmarsh published the autobiographical book Rider (Lulu.com self- publishing), which chronicles his experiences and observations on the road touring from 1992 to 1998 with Swervedriver. Meanwhile, Franklin had begun an indie rock collaboration with Interpol drummer Sam Fogarino under what would become the moniker Magnetic Morning. At the time, Franklin held little optimism for a Swervedriver reunion as they were all deep in individual pursuits but by mid 2007 had changed his outlook, referring positively to the successful 2004 reunion of the Pixies during an interview promoting his first release as a solo artist, Bolts of Melody. The former band mates would get together with serious intentions shortly thereafter, when the idea resurfaced in a phone conversation between Franklin and Hartridge in early October 2007; on 19 October 2007, they officially announced that Swervedriver would reunite for a 2008 international tour. Hindmarsh confirmed the news on the band's discussion forum the following day: \\"Yep ‚Äì it's true. Your enthusiasm & passion for the band over these past years has been truly awe-inspiring. Humbling in fact.\\" Franklin released the following statement on 6 November 2007 about the band getting back together: =Reunion tour and activity (2008‚Äì2013)= Swervedriver kicked off their reunion tour on 27 April 2008 at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California and continued through North America for the next two months. The band then performed a pair of shows in Great Britain at the Scala London and King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow on 16 and 18 September 2008, respectively. On the heels of the tour's success, remastered and extended editions of Raise, Mezcal Head, and Ejector Seat Reservation were reissued in the UK by Sony BMG on 13 October 2008. The special edition Digipaks contained four rare album-era bonus tracks and a 16-page booklet with expanded artwork and liner notes written by Franklin and Hartridge. Label collaboration Second Motion Records/Hi-Speed Soul licensed the Raise and Mezcal Head reissues and released them to American audiences on 20 January 2009. Swervedriver would go on to conduct a series of mini-tours over a year-and-a-half span (working around Franklin's busy solo career) beginning in late 2009 with another short stint in the UK. This first mini-tour culminated at the three-day All Tomorrow's Parties music festival at Butlin's holiday camp in Minehead from 4‚Äì6 December 2009, in which they shared a lineup with the likes of My Bloody Valentine, Sonic Youth, Buzzcocks, and Bob Mould. They regrouped a year later, this time reuniting with original drummer Bonnar, for two Scandinavian gigs in early November 2010 followed by a four-show trip to Australia in February 2011, attending the Perth International Arts Festival on 20 February 2011. In mid-June 2011, the band hit the three major US cities and Toronto with Mikey Jones of Bolts of Melody and Brooklyn dream pop act Heaven filling in for Bonnar, who was unavailable. In preparation for an early 2012 American tour, Swervedriver appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on 26 March 2012, performing their debut single \\"Son of Mustang Ford\\" and premiering the song \\"Deep Wound\\", their first new material in 14 years, which was mixed and engineered by Albert Di Fiore. The tour went on for the next two weeks (with Jones again on drums), during which the band conducted a four-song studio session for KEXP 90.3 FM in Seattle on 4 April 2012, again playing \\"Deep Wound\\". In June 2013, the band announced a five-date tour in Australia for late September‚Äìearly October 2013 during which they would be performing Raise in its entirety along with \\"old and new highlights\\". The following month they recorded \\"Deep Wound\\" and on 20 August 2013 announced the single's release through Tym Records, scheduling a release date of 26 September 2013 to coincide with the start of the mini-tour. A limited number of purple seven-inch singles were made available for presale and limited edition red and yellow singles were sold during the tour. =I Wasn't Born to Lose You and Future Ruins (2014‚Äìpresent)= At the conclusion of their \\"Raise\\" mini-tour, Swervedriver began recording material for a new album at Birdland Studios in Melbourne and then continued work at Konk Studios over the first half of 2014. The band took a break from recording to reprise a one-off \\"Raise\\" show at The Garage in Highbury, London on 4 April 2014. On 7 January 2015, the band announced that their new album, titled I Wasn't Born to Lose You, would be released on 3 March 2015 through the Cobraside record label. The first single off the album, \\"Setting Sun\\", was released on 13 January 2015.

Background According to the liner notes to the album Refrain of Evangelion, director Hideaki Anno had originally wanted to use a piece of classical music as the opening, but due to concern that this might confuse the anime viewership, a decision was made to use a more upbeat J-pop song instead. Lyricist Oikawa Neko, commissioned to write the song, recalled that she completed \\"Zankoku na tenshi no tƒìze\\" in 2 hours by browsing the idea proposal for the anime and watching incomplete clips of the first two unaired episodes in fast mode. She had been given specific instructions by the producer to make the wording sophisticated and \\"philosophical\\". She reveals she got inspiration for the title from the manga A Cruel God Reigns. The production for the song was handled by Toshimichi ≈åtsuki of the King Records label. The original song included a male chorus, which was cut at director Hideaki Anno's request in order to \\"emphasize maternal affection\\".Refrain of Evangelion OST Booklet, 2003. Two instrumental versions of the song, arranged by series composer Shir≈ç Sagisu are played in the finale episode, \\"Take care of yourself.\\" These are \\"The Heady Feeling of Freedom\\" and \\"Good, or Don't Be\\", scored for violin, piano, and guitar. \\"The Heady Feeling of Freedom\\" is a somber and reflective piece for bowed strings and guitar, while \\"Good, or Don't Be\\" is played to a light piano and guitar tone. Both are considerably different in feel from the more hard driving original. A similar, but sparser, version can also be heard during the intermission between the two parts of Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth. In 2009, the original vocalist Takahashi recorded a new single, which included a remake of both this song and \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\", the series ending theme, to tie in with the theatrical release of the second Rebuild of Evangelion film. In June 2018, King Records released a new HD music video of the song on YouTube. Reception In a survey by TV Asahi that was used to determine the results of a list of the 100 unforgettable anime theme songs, \\"A Cruel Angel's Thesis\\" made it to #55. In a later survey on a similar program on TV Asahi, it was included as the #18 song amongst anime released during the 1990s. In 2011, the song won first place in JASRAC's annual awards for \\"its continued royalties from online sales, pachinko and pachislo (pachinko parlor slot machine) games, karaoke, and other venues in 2010‚Äî15 years after its debut.\\" The song was in the top 10 karaoke selections in 2009, 2010, and 2011. =Oricon ranking= All of the songs have ranked in the top 25 of the Oricon Weekly Charts after they had been released. The original version of the single (paired with another song by Takahashi) stayed on the charts for 22 weeks, peaking at #27. However, the version paired with Claire's rendition of \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" remained on the charts for 61 weeks after its release, and peaked at #17. When this version of the single was re- released in 2003, it remained on the charts for 41 weeks, peaking at #9. Takahashi's \\"2009 VERSION\\" release stayed on the charts for 14 weeks, peaking at #22. Over the years, the song has become a hit on digital download stores. In February 2014, it received a Million certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan, for more than a million copies sold through cellphone and PC download platforms.

Contemporary topics include photography, video, film, design, and computer art. Art education may focus on students creating art, on learning to criticize or appreciate art, or some combination of the two. Approaches French painting school following the atelier method Discussion class on art appreciation at Shimer College Art is often taught through drawing, painting, sculpture, installation, and mark making. Drawing is viewed as an empirical activity which involves seeing, interpreting and discovering appropriate marks to reproduce an observed phenomenon. Drawing instruction has been a component of formal education in the West since the Hellenistic period. In East Asia, arts education for nonprofessional artists typically focused on brushwork; calligraphy was numbered among the Six Arts of gentlemen in the Chinese Zhou Dynasty, and calligraphy and Chinese painting were numbered among the Four Arts of scholar-officials in imperial China. An alternative approach to art education involves an emphasis on imagination, both in interpreting and creating art. Many educators will ask their students \\"Why do you think the artist made this choice?\\", once they've given an answer, they'll then give them context of the piece, then ask them again. This is to get students to consider the deeper meaning behind works, rather than just showing them a pretty picture. Art education is also about experimentation and purposeful play and linking their art to conceptual messages and personal experiences. Allowing students to connect a piece to emotion, helps them better understand how the artwork connects to the artist and their subject, developing their critical thinking skills. Alternative approaches, such as visual culture and issue-based approaches in which students explore societal and personal issues through art, also inform art education today. Prominent curricular models for art education include: *A sixfold model divided into \\"Creative-Productive, Cultural-Historical and Critical-Responsive‚Äù components in some provinces of Canada *Discipline Based Art Education (DBAE) came to favor in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s, and it focused on specific skills including techniques, art criticism and art history. Heavily backed by the Getty Education Institute for the Arts, DBAE faded after the Institute ceased funding in 1998. *Teaching for Artistic Behavior (TAB) is a choice-based model that began in the 1970s in Massachusetts in the United States. TAB suggests that students should be the artists and be guided on their own individual artistic interests. In addition, especially in higher education in the liberal arts tradition, art is often taught as \\"art appreciation\\", a subject for aesthetic criticism rather than direct engagement. Some studies show that strong art education programs have demonstrated increased student performance in other academic areas, due to art activities' exercising their brains' right hemispheres and delateralizing their thinking. Also see Betty Edwards' Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. Art education is not limited to formal educational institutions. Some professional artists provide private or semi- private instruction in their own studios. This may take the form of an apprenticeship in which the student learns from a professional artist while assisting the artist with their work. One form of this teaching style is the Atelier Method as exemplified by Gustave Moreau who taught Picasso, Braque and many other artists. =Apprenticeship= The Drawing Class, by Michiel Sweerts, c. 1656 Historically art was taught in Europe via the atelier method systemAtelier instruction where artists took on apprentices who learned their trade in much the same way as that of guilds such as the stonemasons or goldsmiths. During their free time formal training took place in art workshops or, more often, in homes or alone outside. It was in these ateliers that artists learned the craft through apprenticeship to masters, a relationship that was controlled by guild statutes. Florentine contracts dating from the late 13th century state that the master was expected to clothe and feed the apprentice, who was called upon to be a faithful servant in return. An apprentice often paid the master during the early years of his education; assuming the apprenticeship was productive, the student would be compensated later in his training. Northern European workshops featured similar terms.Dunkerton, Jill, et al. Giotto to Durer: Early Renaissance Painting in the National Gallery, 136. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1991. Initially, learning to draw was a priority in this system. Michelangelo recommended that a young painter spend a year on drawing alone, then six years grinding colors, preparing panels and using gold leaf, during which time the study of drawing would continue. Another six years would be required to master fresco and tempera painting.Dunkerton, Jill, et al. 136 Historically, design has had some precedence over the fine arts with schools of design being established all over Europe in the 18th century. These examples of skill and values from the early European art inspired later generations, including the Colonists of early America. =Cultural appropriation within the classroom= Individuals who employ cultural appropriation have the ability to produce works of considerable aesthetic merit.James O. Young, ‚ÄúArt, Authenticity and Appropriation‚Äù Front. Philos. China (2006) 3:455‚Äì476 (2006): 456, accessed October 2011, DOI 10.1007/s11466-006-0019-2 Using properties of art from different cultures such as decoration or emulation of creative process can foster a greater understanding and appreciation of crafts from different cultures. This technique can be appreciated in the production of African or Native-American mask making projects, where students emulate technique and explore new material use and construction methods which esteem those practices of different cultures.Elizabeth Manley Delacruz, ‚ÄúApproaches to Multiculturalism in Art Education Curriculum Products: Business as Usual‚Äù Journal of Aesthetic Education(1996): 85 Accessed November 26, 2011 By country =Argentina= Leading country in the development of the arts in Latin America, in 1875 created the National Society of the Stimulus of the Arts, founded by painters Eduardo Schiaffino, Eduardo S√≠vori, and other artists. Their guild was rechartered as the National Academy of Fine Arts in 1905 and, in 1923, on the initiative of painter and academic Ernesto de la C√°rcova, as a department in the University of Buenos Aires, the Superior Art School of the Nation. Currently, the leading educational organization for the arts in the country is the UNA Universidad Nacional de las Artes.Institutional Transformation IUNA - Law 24.521, Ministry of Justice & Education, Argentina (text in Spanish) / http://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/40000-44999/40779/norma.htm =Australia= Australian Universities which have Visual / Fine Art departments or courses within their institutions have moved from Studio Based teaching models, associated with Art Schools, to more integrated theoretical / practical emphasis. University of Western Australia has moved from a master's degree with theoretical emphasis to a theoretical BA Art degree. Studio based teaching initiatives integrating contextual and media elements have been implemented as part of a national Studio Teaching ProjectStudio Teaching Project supported by the Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) since 2007. =Egypt= The first modern art school in Egypt was opened in 1908 as the Cairo College of Fine Arts. These early art schools largely taught the Western aesthetic traditions. As a result, after independence there was an effort to incorporate Egyptian and Middle Eastern traditions into art and art appreciation courses. However, the process was slow; students at Cairo College of Fine Arts were not able to major in non-European art history until 1999. =Italy= Art schools were established in Italy as early as the 13th century, starting with a painting school in Venice founded by a Greek painter named Theophanes around 1200. =The Netherlands= The Dutch Art Teachers Association (Nederlandse Vereniging voor Tekenonderwijs) was founded in 1880 and began to publish a monthly magazine in 1884. Since the late 20th century, the growing diversity of Dutch society has made Dutch art and art education increasingly multicultural. =United Kingdom= Formal art education emerged in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century, motivated in part by a desire to match the quality of design work being done in France. The model initially adopted was that of the German commercial schools. Prince Albert was particularly influential in the creation of schools of Art in the UK. Currently in the UK, the art curriculum is prescribed by the government's National Curriculum except in public or fee paying schools. Prince Charles has created The Prince's Drawing School in Hoxton to preserve the teaching of academic drawing. =United States= Adult art education class at the Brooklyn Museum in 1935. The study of art appreciation in America began with the Artists of Today Movement in the late 19th century and began to fade at the end of the 1920s. Picture study was an important part of the art education curriculum. Attention to the aesthetics in classrooms led to public interest in beautifying the school, home, and community, which was known as ‚ÄúArt in Daily Living‚Äù. The idea was to bring culture to the child to change the parents.Smith, Peter (1986,Sept.) The Ecology of Picture Study, Art Education[48‚Äì54]. The picture study movement died out at the end of the 1920s as a result of new ideas regarding learning art appreciation through studio work became more popular in the United States. American educational philosopher and school reformer John Dewey was influential in broadening access to art education in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century. Since World War II, artist training has moved to elementary schools, and contemporary art has become an increasingly academic and intellectual field. Prior to World War II an artist did not usually need a college degree. Since that time the Bachelor of Fine Arts and then the Master of Fine Arts became recommended degrees to be a professional artist, facilitated by the passage of the G.I. Bill in 1944, which sent a wave of World War II veterans off to school, art school included. University art departments quickly expanded. American artists who might once have studied at bohemian, craft- intensive schools like the Art Students League, Black Mountain College, or the Hans Hofmann School of Art in Greenwich Village; began enrolling at universities instead. By the 60s, The School of Visual Arts, Pratt Institute, and Cooper Union in New York City and other art schools across the country like the Kansas City Art Institute, the San Francisco Art Institute, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Princeton and Yale had become one of the first art academies.\\"How to Succeed in Art\\" by Deborah Solomon, New York Times Magazine. June 27, 1999 This trend spread from the United States around the world. Enrollment in art classes at the high school level peaked in the late 1960s‚Äîearly 1970s. With No Child Left Behind (NCLB) (which retains the arts as part of the \\"daily life\\", but does not require reporting or assessment data on this area) there has been additional decline of arts education in American public schools. The United States Department of Education now awards Arts in Education Model Development and Dissemination grants to support organizations with art expertise in their development of artistic curricula. After 2010, an estimate of 25% of the nation's public high schools will end all art programs. Various \\"ed-tech\\" companies like Kadenze and edX have attempted to mitigate this loss through online arts education.Art Schools Go MOOC, With A New Online Platform National organizations promoting arts education include Americans for the ArtsAmericans for the Arts including Art.

Education through the visual arts is an important and effective influence in allowing students, from an early age, to comprehend and implement the foundational democratic process emphasized within the United States societal structure.Gude, Olivia. \\"Art Education for Democratic Life\\". Lowenfeld Lecture 2009. National Art Education Association. Minnesota, Minneapolis. 20 April 2009 In 2008, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) studied 7,900 eight-grade students in the fields of art and music. The findings of the study concluded that female students earned higher scores than their male peers in both music and visual art. Olivia Gude, the 2009 recipient of the National Art Education Association‚Äôs Lowenfeld Lecture Scholarship, spoke about the numerous ways in which art education is instrumental in forming an informed self- and world-aware citizen. She asserts that: : > Through art education, students develop enhanced skills for understanding > the meaning making of others. Through quality art education, youth develop > the capacity to learn several jobs much easier than others. Most > significantly, engagement with the arts teaches youth to perceive complexity > as pleasure and possibility, not as irritating uncertainty. Heightened self- > awareness is extended to heightened awareness of others . . . Special education Art education was combined with special education even before there were reforms to create special accommodations for children with special needs in typical classrooms. When it comes to art, art therapists are often used to connect with students with special needs. However, some art therapists pull students out of the classroom, causing them to fall behind in their other schoolwork such as math, English, and science. Because of this, art therapy is reserved for students who do not have much chance for long-term improvements, but rather short-term developmental skills, or for those who seek to increase their all-round capabilities.Van Meter, M. L. (2010.). \\"Art therapy and special education\\" (PDF). Retrieved November 24, 2011. Special educator Jean Lokerson and art educator Amelia Jones wrote that ‚Äúthe art room is a place where learning disabilities can turn into learning assets.‚Äù Special needs students often come out of their shells and get enthusiastic about creating. Art is also a way that special educators teach their students fundamentals that they may not even realize.Gerber, B. (2011). \\"Art education and special education: A promising partnership\\" (PDF). Paper presented at 2011 National Art Education Association national convention, Seattle, WA. Retrieved November 24, 2011. There are ongoing studies that continue to prove that art and special education go hand in hand. Testing continues to prove that art in any classroom, but especially special education classrooms causes students to be motivated, enthusiastic, and in some cases, even promote learning in other subject areas.Iwai, K.

Current trends in theory and scholarship  The domain of art education is broadening to include a wider range of visual and popular culture.

Within the NAEA, research and publications are being geared toward issues of learning, community, advocacy, research and knowledge.(2008). Creating a visual arts education research agenda for the 21st century: Encouraging individual and collaborative research. Reston: National Art Education Association. Since 2016, the Art Education Research Institute (AERI) has held an annual symposium that supports critical, systematic, empirical, and theoretical research and scholarship that addresses key intellectual and practical issues in the field of art education. AERI seeks to promote a broad range of rigorous research practices and methodologies drawn from the arts, humanities, and social sciences to improve inquiry related to teaching and learning in and through the visual arts. A/r/t/ography is a method of inquiring about one‚Äôs teaching practice within an art classroom (Irwin & Springgay, 2008). It integrates theory into teaching practice and sees the class as a living organism which is susceptible to change (Irwin & Springgay,2008). Rita Irwin and Stephanie Springgay (2008), Art Education theorists and faculty at the University of British Columbia explain that a/r/t/ography focuses on the in-between of art-making, researching and teaching and is perceived as not an environment or object but as a process of learning for the teacher and their students.

Background The song was written by Mick Jones after the disastrous Anarchy Tour and contains pointed observations about the civic hall bureaucrats who had cancelled concerts, the police, big business and especially record companies. The song mentions a 'meeting in Mayfair' which is thought to refer to the EMI shareholders' meeting held on 7 December 1976, which effectively withdrew all support for the Anarchy Tour. Also alluded to in the song are the 'old-boy' peerage networks and hapless politicians. Writing for the A.V. Club, Jason Heller said that the song \\"imagines a deliberately, dramatically exaggerated England circa 1977, one where urban claustrophobia, totalitarian authority, and a robotic kind of daily routine\\". Single release The band virtually disowned the song, following their record label CBS's decision to release the song as a single without consulting the band. The band had already told Melody Maker magazine that their next single would be \\"Janie Jones\\", and were irate that CBS had undermined them and made a decision to release \\"Remote Control\\" instead without the band's permission. To the band, the song became a symbol of everything they were fighting against. The incident was referred to in the first lines of a later song, \\"Complete Control\\", which is on the 1979 US release of the album: : They said, 'Release \\"Remote Control\\", but we didn't want it on the label... The B-side is a mono live version of \\"London's Burning\\". The band re-recorded the song in early summer 1979 during rehearsals for London Calling, at Vanilla Studios in Vauxhall.

Post Cereals also started producing Marshmallow Alpha-Bits in 1990. Alpha-Bits cereal was invented by a father of seven named Thomas M. Quigley who worked for Post Cereals. The cereal was introduced in 1957 and was taken off the market in 2006. However, Alpha-Bits reappeared for sale in January 2008 with a new formulation, touting \\"0% Sugar!\\" as a \\"Limited Edition\\" cereal. The old recipe was reintroduced later in 2008. The cereal was substantially reformulated in 2017, with the \\"new and improved\\" Alpha-Bits having larger shapes than its predecessor. Varieties Marshmallow Alpha-Bits, introduced in 1990, contained frosted alphabet-shaped corn cereal bits and marshmallows. This variation of the original Alpha-Bits cereal contained marshmallow vowels: pink A's, yellow E's, purple I's, orange O's, green U's, and, later, blue Y's. Over time, the marshmallows underwent changes such as super-swirls and splits in their colors. Beginning in 2004, Marshmallow Alpha-Bits began disappearing from various markets, before finally being discontinued altogether in 2011. Marshmallow Alpha-Bits were invented by a small-time entrepreneur named Andrew R. Miller and his cousin Andrew W. Peterson, the latter of whom was a chef at a local restaurant in upstate New York. The pair sold the idea to Post in 1989. In August 2005, Post Cereals introduced sugar-free Alpha-Bits cereal . In some regions, such as the southeast, Marshmallow Alpha-Bits were removed from shelves by 2000. Mascots One of the first advertisers of the cereal was the Ruff and Reddy cartoon show in 1957. Alvin and the Chipmunks were also early pitchers for Alpha-Bits, as Post's then-parent General Foods was the sponsor of The Alvin Show for its sole season beginning in 1961. Beginning in 1964, the mascot for Alpha-Bits was a postman, possibly a pun on \\"Post Man\\" named Loveable Truly, who was originally voiced by insult comic Jack E. Leonard in a Southern accent. Loveable Truly was also a character in the 1960s cartoon show Linus the Lionhearted on CBS, along with other Post Cereals mascots at the time (including Sugar Bear of Golden Crisp, then called Sugar Crisp). Since then, mascots have included the Alpha-Bits Wizard, who appeared near children in kitchens. In Canada, the last Alpha-Bits mascot was Alpha, a computer who \\"makes bits\\". As of 2014, he has been discontinued. The Canadian Alpha at first resembled IBM PCs, but recent versions resemble a 2006 iMac. In the 1980s there was yet another mascot named Alfie the Alpha-Bits Cereal Wonder Dog. Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5 starred in a series of Alpha-Bits musical TV commercials in 1973. In the 1990s the mascots are the anthropomorphic cereal bits. Post Alpha-Bits cereal was also a sponsor of Arthur on PBS. The TV show Super Why! currently mascots and endorses this cereal.

It was inspired by the Cannonball Baker Sea- To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash run by Brock Yates, which inspired several other films, including Cannonball (1976), Cannonball Run (1981), and Speed Zone (1989), as well as an actual event, the American Gumball Rally and Gumball 3000 international race. Plot Michael Bannon (Michael Sarrazin), a wealthy but bored businessman and candymaker, issues the code word \\"Gumball\\" to his fellow automobile enthusiasts, who gather in a garage in New York City to embark on a coast-to-coast race \\"with no catalytic converter and no 55-mile-per-hour speed limit,\\" in the shortest amount of time. There is only one rule: \\"There are no rules.\\" Their longtime nemesis, Los Angeles Police Department Lieutenant Roscoe (Normann Burton), also learns of the race (no explanation of how he learns of it is provided). Most of the film is devoted to the adventures of the various driving teams and Roscoe's ineffectual attempts to apprehend them. A number of running gags ensue ‚Äì the Jaguar that will not start; the silent Lapchik's (Harvey Jason) numerous mishaps; Italian race driver Franco Bertollini's (Ra√∫l Juli√°) frequent detours to seduce beautiful women ‚Äì as well as some stunts and driving sequences. The race ends at the Queen Mary in Long Beach, California where the finishers celebrate their adventures and the defeated Roscoe sulks off to one side ‚Äì until a fleet of police cars and tow trucks, summoned by Roscoe, arrive to impound the Gumball vehicles. Roscoe had contrived to see to it that all of them were guaranteed to be illegally parked once the post-race party in the parking lot ran past 11 PM. Bannon congratulates Roscoe on his final victory (final because Roscoe, who has been after Bannon and Smith since they were in high school, has reached mandatory retirement age) and again utters the command \\"Gumball\\" to initiate a race back to New York.

Opening scenes of the race were filmed in downtown New York City early on a Sunday morning on closed roads (including Broadway and Park Avenue.)http://onthesetofnewyork.com/thegumballrally.html. Retrieved July 10, 2017. The George Washington Bridge and Lincoln Tunnel was used for the exit from New York into New Jersey. The final duel between the Cobra and Ferrari was filmed at (and in) the Los Angeles River and the closing scene was shot at the Queen Mary in Long Beach. Additional filming was done in the City of Orange, California, specifically around the downtown Plaza area (approximately 1:07 - 1:10) Cultural impact The spirit of the Gumball Rally has inspired road rally enthusiasts to create local versions of the Gumball in individual states. There are annual Gumball Rallies in Michigan, Florida, and California. The rules of these races are more stratified than the movie, and speeding or demented driving is discouraged. But anyone who can afford the comparatively modest entry fee and acquire sponsors can enter any sort of vehicle in the competition. Like a road rally, the state Gumballers have to pass through checkpoints over the course of the race, which runs for an entire weekend. There is an elaborate formula not known to the competitors for determining the winner of the Rally. Part of the Rally's mission seems to be to promote state attractions and businesses, but the idea still seems to be having a great deal of fun while doing so. An international version of the Gumball called the Gumball 3000 was created by a Briton, Maximillion Cooper, as a 3000-mile race through multiple countries. How one enters and what the rules may be are not clear, though it appears checkpoints are involved. However, most of the drivers appear to be celebrities of various sorts, and the entry fees are rumored to be substantial. The Rally often partners with charities such as the Wounded Warrior Project as a fundraising event. The one thing that the Gumball 3000 has in common with the original Gumball Rally is that any sort of vehicle can be entered. Past entries have included a Blower Bentley, a 1965 Aston Martin DB5, a Winnebago RV, and an ex-New York Police Department Ford Crown Victoria in NYPD livery. Prizes are awarded for best time, most original car, for special actions during the race, and to whoever best exemplifies the good- hearted spirit of the event, the coveted \\"Gumball Spirit Trophy.\\" In the United States, a similar event is held under the name American Gumball Rally and is usually confined to the borders of the state in which the event is held. The founder Randy Kolher, is a Detroit Motorcity native who wanted to host event to bring people together. Much like the Gumball 3000, the American Gumball Rally has vehicles from varying manufacturers, with no set limits. Entry fees are much more affordable, yet the fun level is equally set for entry level to seasoned participants. This rally has remained open to individual, as well as corporate sponsors, and has quickly gained a cult following. With safety being a top priority of the founder, The American Gumball Rally has also gained the unofficial support of the state authorities, as the rally likes to Set the example for having fun while also following the rules of the road. StreetCulture.US founder (Instagram and Youtube) George Constantine Mourtos / G.E. Spencer (Public name),has been a big promoter of the rally as well as its growth since his participation in 2016, sharing the rally's availability with fellow auto enthusiasts at cruise ins and car meets all over the east coast. George has been a big advocate for automotive safety and fun, while trying to break the image that all auto enthusiasts are reckless street racers. In 2010, a rally similar in concept to the Gumball 3000 but confined to the State of Texas called the Texas Outlaw Run was conducted. As of 2013, it has not been repeated. At Disneyland and Disney World, once a year Disney fans hold what is called the MiceChat Gumball Rally. The objective is simple: to ride as many rides in Disneyland as possible in a single day. The winning teams are presented with medals and have bragging rights forever after; and the grand prize is a gumball machine topped by Cinderella's Castle, obviously inspired by the movie's Gumball Trophy. As noted above, The Gumball Rally ushered in a subgenre of road-race films, many of them starring a younger Burt Reynolds, one of whose more popular films, Smokey and the Bandit, spawned a still-ongoing yearly rally event called The Bandit Run.

Overview There are references to dances such as the galliard or sinkapace, volta, coranto, pavane, and canario, and stage directions indicate dancing in many plays including Romeo and Juliet, Much Ado About Nothing, Twelfth Night, or What You Will, Macbeth, and As You Like It. Terms like 'measure' and 'foot it' can also refer to dancing, and dance is often woven into the plot as part of a masque or masquerade ball, especially in plays by John Marston. Primary sources There is no known dancing instruction manual for English dances of Shakespeare's time, but there are descriptions of almains and the measures in the Inns of Court manuscripts (see Payne), mentions of Morris dance in church court and civic records (see Forrest), and large sections of dancing in court masques (see Ravelhofer and Welsford). Other dances referred to in English Renaissance plays such as the galliard, pavane, and volta are described in French and Italian dancing manuals by Thoinot Arbeau and Fabritio Caroso among others. Some of the country dances Shakespeare mentions appear in John Playford's The English Dancing Master (1651), but Playford's choreographies probably differ from the versions performed on the Shakespearean stage. Jigs often followed performances of plays in late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century England, but we know very little about the actual steps of this dance (see Baskerville).

Ignatow. Ancestry.com. Social Security Death Index [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2009. was a resident of Louisville, Kentucky, U.S., who was tried for the 1988 murder of his former girlfriend, Brenda Sue Schaefer. The case was controversial because Ignatow was acquitted of the charge and he later admitted killing Schaefer. Under the legal principle of double jeopardy, however, Ignatow could not be tried a second time for the murder. He was, instead, convicted and jailed for several instances of perjury in his grand jury testimony for the case. Murder Ignatow and Brenda Schaefer had been in a relationship for two years at the time of the murder. Ignatow knew that Schaefer, who had complained that he was abusive, was planning to break off the involvement. He asked a former girlfriend, Mary Ann Shore, to help him plan and carry out the murder. They spent several weeks making extensive preparations. Shore testified they had \\"scream tested\\" her house and dug a grave in the woods behind it. On September 23, 1988, Schaefer met Ignatow to return some jewelry of his that she had in her possession. Instead, Ignatow took Schaefer to Shore's house, where he pulled a gun on Schaefer and locked her in the house. Schaefer was blindfolded, gagged, and bound. Ignatow forced Schaefer to strip, photographed her in suggestive positions, raped, sodomized and beat her before killing her with chloroform. Shore took pictures while Ignatow raped and tortured Schaefer and assisted Ignatow in covering up the murder. They buried her behind Shore's house. He took Schaefer's jewelry and the exposed film. Investigation and trial After Schaefer's disappearance, police quickly suspected Ignatow, but were unable to locate any witnesses or physical evidence linking him to Schaefer's disappearance, or even to locate Schaefer's body. In search for any lead that could let them move forward with the case, police invited Ignatow to clear his name by testifying before a grand jury. There, he mentioned Shore's name, bringing her into the investigation for the first time. The police interviewed Shore, who eventually confessed to helping plan the murder, and to taking pictures of Ignatow as he tortured and abused Schaefer. Shore also led the investigators to the grave site, where Schaefer's badly decomposed body had been buried for over a year. The autopsy showed she had been abused, but any DNA evidence, from blood and semen, had decomposed. The investigators convinced Shore to wear a wire, by promising only to charge her with tampering with evidence. In the surveillance, Shore told Ignatow that the FBI was hounding her and she was afraid the property behind her house was being sold and developed. He was on tape berating her for letting the FBI \\"rattle\\" her and told her he didn't care if they dug up the whole property because \\"that place we dug is not shallow.\\" Based on this recording, prosecutors charged Ignatow with murder in 1991. The trial was moved outside the Louisville/Jefferson County area, to Kenton County where far less publicity had been generated. In one section of the recorded conversation between Ignatow and Shore, in which Ignatow stated, \\"That place we dug is not shallow. Beside that one area right by where that site is does not have any trees by it,\\" the jury decided that Ignatow said \\"safe,\\" not \\"site,\\" as police believed. This led the jurors to conclude that the discussion involved a buried safe. Furthermore, Shore, the prosecution's star witness, wore a tiny miniskirt to court and laughed during her testimony, undermining her credibility in the eyes of the jury. The defense argued that Shore, not Ignatow, had killed Schaefer. The jury acquitted Ignatow. The judge was so embarrassed by the verdict that he took the unusual step of writing a letter of apology to the Schaefer family. Schaefer's parents died before the trial began. According to some family and friends, their deaths were premature due to the heartbreak and stress of Schaefer's murder. Aftermath Six months after Ignatow's acquittal, a carpetlayer working in Ignatow's old house, which had been sold to fund his defense, pulled up a length of carpet in a hallway. Under it he found a floor vent containing a plastic bag, taped to hold it inside the vent. Inside the bag was the jewelry Schaefer had taken with her on the night of her disappearance, and three rolls of undeveloped film. When developed, the film showed Ignatow torturing and raping Schaefer, just as Shore had described. Ignatow's face was not in the pictures, but body hair patterns and moles matched him perfectly. Ignatow was brought to trial for perjury based on his grand jury testimony. Knowing that he could not be retried for the murder because of double jeopardy, Ignatow confessed in court at his perjury trial. He turned to Schaefer's brothers in court and said that he had killed her, but claimed that she had died peacefully. Ignatow served five years of an eight-year sentence for perjury. The state later prosecuted him on perjury charges for testimony he gave in a case against Schaefer's employer for threatening to kill Ignatow if he did not reveal where Schaefer was. He was sentenced to nine years for that perjury charge. Ignatow was released from prison for the second time in December 2006. He returned to Louisville, living in a home four miles from the house where he murdered Schaefer. Author Bob Hill wrote a book on the case called Double Jeopardy, which became a bestseller and provoked widespread interest in the case.Hill, Bob. Double Jeopardy: Obsession, Murder, and Justice Denied. William Morrow & Co, 1995. MSNBC and CourtTV also produced television documentaries on the case. Brenda Sue Schaefer is buried in her family's plot in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville. Death On September 1, 2008, Ignatow was found dead in his home. He was 70 years old. An autopsy determined that Ignatow died from an accidental fall that lacerated his head or his arm, and that he had eventually bled to death. The neighbor who found his body stated that \\"It just looked like he had fell... and he tried to go to the kitchen, and there was a blood trail that way, and then it looked like he tried to make it to his room, before he made it to his room, that's where they found his body at.\\" Ignatow's neighbor also described him as \\"a sick and elderly man, alone and struggling for help when he apparently stumbled to his death. I used to hear him all night, asking for Jesus to come get him, because he was in a lot of pain.\\" Ignatow's son admits, \\"He will probably go down as one of the most hated men in Louisville... Maybe it'll just put it to rest, that we all don't have to keep dealing with this over and over. That's what I hope.\\" Media The television series American Justice aired the death of Brenda Schaefer titled \\"Getting Away with Murder\\", season 9, episode 7 original air date March 15, 2000.

The fort, located at the southern end of Lake George, on the frontier between the British Province of New York and the French Province of Canada, was garrisoned by a poorly supported force of British regulars and provincial militia led by Lieutenant Colonel George Monro. After several days of bombardment, Monro surrendered to Montcalm, whose force included nearly 2,000 Indians from various tribes. The terms of surrender included the withdrawal of the garrison to Fort Edward, with specific terms that the French military protect the British from the Indians as they withdrew from the area. In one of the most notorious incidents of the French and Indian War, Montcalm's Indian allies violated the agreed terms of surrender and attacked the British column, which had been deprived of ammunition, as it left the fort. They killed and scalped many soldiers, took as captives women, children, servants, and slaves, and slaughtered sick and wounded prisoners. Early accounts of the events called it a massacre and implied that as many as 1,500 people were killed, although it is unlikely more than 200 people (less than 10% of the British fighting strength) were actually killed in the massacre. The exact role of Montcalm and other French leaders in encouraging or defending against the actions of their allies, and the total number of casualties incurred as a result of their actions, is a subject of historical debate. The memory of the killings influenced the actions of British military leaders, especially those of British General Jeffery Amherst, for the remainder of the war. Background The French and Indian War started in 1754 over territorial disputes between the North American colonies of France and Great Britain in areas that are now western Pennsylvania and upstate New York. The first few years of the war had not gone particularly well for the British. A major expedition by General Edward Braddock in 1755 ended in disaster, and British military leaders were unable to mount any campaigns the following year. In a major setback, a French and Indian army led by General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm captured the garrison and destroyed fortifications in the Battle of Fort Oswego in August 1756.Steele, pp. 28‚Äì56 In July 1756 the Earl of Loudoun arrived to take command of the British forces in North America, replacing William Shirley, who had temporarily assumed command after Braddock's death.Parkman, p. 397 =British planning= Loudoun's plan for the 1757 campaign was submitted to the government in London in September 1756, and was focused on a single expedition aimed at the heart of New France, the city of Quebec. It called for a purely defensive postures along the frontier with New France, including the contested corridor of the Hudson River and Lake Champlain between Albany, New York and Montreal.Pargellis, p. 211 Following the Battle of Lake George in 1755, the French had begun construction of Fort Carillon (now known as Fort Ticonderoga) near the southern end of Lake Champlain, while the British had built Fort William Henry at the southern end of Lake George, and Fort Edward on the Hudson River, about south of Fort William Henry.Steele, pp. 59‚Äì61 The area between William Henry and Carillon was a wilderness dominated by Lake George that historian Ian Steele described as \\"a military waterway that left opposing cannons only a few days apart.\\"Steele, p. 57 Lord Loudoun, portrait by Allan Ramsayalt=Lord Loudoun in a half-length portrait. Painted when he was about 45, he faces the painter, wearing a red coat over a white vest and a white shirt with lace on the front. His body is turned three quarters, so only his right arm is partially visible. He appears to be wearing a powdered wig. Loudoun's plan depended on the expedition's timely arrival at Quebec, so that French troops would not have the opportunity to move against targets on the frontier, and would instead be needed to defend the heartland of the province of Canada along the Saint Lawrence River.Pargellis, p. 243 However, political turmoil in London over the progress of the Seven Years' War both in North America and in Europe resulted in a change of power, with William Pitt the Elder rising to take control over military matters. Loudoun consequently did not receive any feedback from London on his proposed campaign until March 1757. Before this feedback arrived he developed plans for the expedition to Quebec, and worked with the provincial governors of the Thirteen Colonies to develop plans for a coordinated defence of the frontier, including the allotment of militia quotas to each province.Pargellis, pp. 212‚Äì215 When William Pitt's instructions finally reached Loudoun in March 1757, they called for the expedition to first target Louisbourg on the Atlantic coast of √éle Royale, now known as Cape Breton Island.Pargellis, p. 232 Although this did not materially affect the planning of the expedition, it was to have significant consequences on the frontier. The French forces on the Saint Lawrence would be too far from Louisbourg to support it, and would consequently be free to act elsewhere. Loudoun assigned his best troops to the Louisbourg expedition, and placed Brigadier General Daniel Webb in command of the New York frontier. He was given about 2,000 regulars, primarily from the 35th and 60th (Royal American) Regiments. The provinces were to supply Webb with about 5,000 militia.Pargellis, p. 235 =French planning= Montcalm, copy by Th√©ophile Hamel from unknown originalalt=A half-length portrait of Montcalm, dressed mainly in black, but also wearing a metal breastplate, against a dark brown background. He is wearing a powdered wig. Following the success of his 1756 assault on Fort Oswego, Montcalm had been seeking an opportunity to deal with the British position at Fort William Henry, since it provided the British with a launching point for attacks against Fort Carillon (now known as Fort Ticonderoga).Steele, p. 78 He was initially hesitant to commit his limited resources against Fort William Henry without knowing more about the disposition of British forces.Parkman, p. 482 Intelligence provided by spies in London arrived in the spring, indicating that the British target was probably Louisbourg. This suggested that troop levels on the British side of the frontier might be low enough to make an attack on Fort William Henry feasible.Nester, p. 52 This idea was further supported after the French questioned deserters and captives taken during periodic scouting and raiding expeditions that both sides conducted, including one resulting in the January Battle on Snowshoes.Parkman, p. 488 As early as December 1756, New France's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, began the process of recruiting Indians for the following summer's campaign. Fueled by stories circulated by Indian participants in the capture of Oswego, this drive was highly successful, drawing nearly 1,000 warriors from the Pays d'en Haut (the more remote regions of New France) to Montreal by June 1757.Steele, p. 79Nester, p. 54 Another 800 Indians were recruited from tribes that lived closer to the Saint Lawrence. =British preparations= alt=See article text for a description of the area. Fort William Henry, built in the fall of 1755, was a roughly square fortification with bastions on the corners, in a design that was intended to repel Indian attacks but was not necessarily sufficient to withstand attack from an enemy that had artillery. Its walls were thick, with log facings surrounding an earthen filling. Inside the fort were wooden barracks two stories high, built around the parade ground. Its magazine was in the northeast bastion, and its hospital was located in the southeast bastion. The fort was surrounded on three sides by a dry moat, with the fourth side sloping down to the lake. The only access to the fort was by a bridge across the moat.Starbuck, p. 6 The fort was capable of housing only four to five hundred men; additional troops were quartered in an entrenched camp southeast of the fort, near the site of the 1755 Battle of Lake George.Starbuck, p. 7 During the winter of 1756‚Äì57, Fort William Henry was garrisoned by several hundred men from the 44th Foot under Major Will Eyre. In March 1757 the French sent an army of 1,500 to attack the fort under the command of the governor's brother, Pierre de Rigaud. Composed primarily of colonial troupes de la marine, militia, and Indians, and without heavy weapons, they besieged the fort for four days, destroying outbuildings and many watercraft before retreating.Nester, pp. 43‚Äì44 Eyre and his men were replaced by Lieutenant Colonel George Monro and the 35th Foot in the spring. Monro established his headquarters in the entrenched camp, where most of his men were located.Nester, p. 55 =French preparations= The Indians that assembled at Montreal were sent south to Fort Carillon, where they joined the French regiments of B√©arn and Royal Roussillon under Fran√ßois-Charles de Bourlamaque, and those of La Sarre, Guyenne, Languedoc, and la Reine under Fran√ßois de Gaston, Chevalier de L√©vis. Combined with the troupes de la marine, militia companies, and the arriving Indians, the force accumulated at Carillon amounted to 8,000 men.Parkman, pp. 489‚Äì492 A hand-drawn map depicting the siege area, by alt=Fort Carillon is at the far northern end of the map, separated from Lake George by a short river with falls. There is a road or path leading from the fort to the northern end of the lake, with a sawmill at the first crossing. The map is labelled with mountains to either side of Lake George, which is long and narrow, extending about 3/4 the length of the map. At its southern end the fort is shown, with the French camp to the northwest, and the camp of Indians and Canadians over the road leading south toward Fort Edward. The latter is near the bottom of the map, on the Hudson River just below some falls. While at Carillon, the French leadership had difficulty controlling the behaviour of its Indian allies. Although they did stop one group from forcing a British prisoner to run the gantlet, a group of Ottawas were not stopped when it was observed that they were ritually cannibalizing another prisoner. French authorities were also frustrated in their ability to limit the Indians' taking of more than their allotted share of rations. Montcalm's aide, Louis Antoine de Bougainville, observed that attempts to curb this activity would have resulted in the loss of some of these forces.Parkman, pp. 493‚Äì497 In another prelude of things to come, many prisoners were taken on 23 July in the Battle of Sabbath Day Point, some of whom were also ritually cannibalized before Montcalm managed to convince the Indians instead to send the captives to Montreal to be sold as slaves.Parkman, p. 498 Prelude Webb, who commanded the area from his base at Fort Edward, received intelligence in April that the French were accumulating resources and troops at Carillon. News of continued French activity arrived with a captive taken in mid-July. Following an attack by Joseph Marin de la Malgue on a work crew near Fort Edward on 23 July, Webb travelled to Fort William Henry with a party of Connecticut rangers led by Major Israel Putnam, and sent a detachment of them onto the lake for reconnaissance.Nester, p. 53 They returned with word that Indians were encamped on islands in the lake about from the fort. Swearing Putnam and his rangers to secrecy, Webb returned to Fort Edward, and on 2 August sent Lieutenant Colonel John Young with 200 regulars and 800 Massachusetts militia to reinforce the garrison at William Henry. This raised the size of the garrison to about 2,500, although several hundred of these were ill, some with smallpox.Steele, p. 69 Siege Montcalm talking with an English officer who had come to negotiate the surrender of the fort. While Montcalm's Indian allies had already begun to move south, his advance force of French troops departed from Carillon on 30 July under L√©vis' command, travelling overland along Lake George's western shore because the expedition did not have enough boats to carry the entire force. Montcalm and the remaining forces sailed the next day, and met with L√©vis for the night at Ganaouske Bay. The next night, L√©vis camped just from Fort William Henry, with Montcalm not far behind. Early on the morning of 3 August, L√©vis and the Canadians blocked the road between Edward and William Henry, skirmishing with the recently arrived Massachusetts militia. Montcalm summoned Monro to surrender at 11:00 am. Monro refused, and sent messengers south to Fort Edward, indicating the dire nature of the situation and requesting reinforcements. Webb, feeling threatened by L√©vis, refused to send any of his estimated 1,600 men north, since they were all that stood between the French and Albany.Nester, p. 57 He wrote to Monro on 4 August that he should negotiate the best terms possible; this communication was intercepted and delivered to Montcalm.Parkman, p. 517 Montcalm, in the meantime, ordered Bourlamaque to begin siege operations. The French opened trenches to the northwest of the fort with the objective of bringing their artillery to bear against the fort's northwest bastion. On 5 August, French guns began firing on the fort from , a spectacle the large Indian contingent relished. The next day a second battery opened fire from further along the same trench, creating a crossfire. The effect of the garrison's return fire was limited to driving French guards from the trenches, and some of the fort's guns either were dismounted or burst owing to the stress of use.Steele, pp. 100‚Äì102 On 7 August, Montcalm sent Bougainville to the fort under a truce flag to deliver the intercepted dispatch. By then the fort's walls had been breached, many of its guns were useless, and the garrison had taken many casualties.Nester, p. 58 After another day of bombardment by the French, during which their trenches approached another , Monro raised the white flag to open negotiations.Nester, p. 59 Massacre The terms of surrender were that the British and their camp followers would be allowed to withdraw, under French escort, to Fort Edward, with the full honours of war, on condition that they refrain from fighting for 18 months. They were allowed to keep their muskets and a single symbolic cannon, but no ammunition. In addition, British authorities were to release French prisoners within three months. Montcalm, before agreeing to these terms, tried to make sure that his Indian allies understood them, and that the chiefs would undertake to restrain their men. This process was complicated by the diversity within the Indian camp, which included some warriors who spoke languages not understood by any European present. The British garrison was then evacuated from the fort to the entrenched camp, and Monro was quartered in the French camp. The Indians then entered the fort and plundered it, butchering some of the wounded and sick that the British had left behind. The French guards posted around the entrenched camp were only somewhat successful at keeping the Indians out of that area, and it took much effort to prevent plunder and scalping there. Montcalm and Monro initially planned to march the prisoners south the following morning, but after seeing the Indian bloodlust, decided to attempt the march that night. When the Indians became aware that the British were getting ready to move, many of them massed around the camp, causing the leaders to call off the march until morning. The next morning, even before the British column began to form up for the march to Fort Edward, the Indians renewed attacks on the largely defenceless British. At 5 am, Indians entered huts in the fort housing wounded British who were supposed to be under the care of French doctors, and killed and scalped them.Nester, p. 60 Monro complained that the terms of capitulation had been violated, but his contingent was forced to surrender some of its baggage in order to be able even to begin the march. As they marched off, they were harassed by the swarming Indians, who snatched at them, grabbing for weapons and clothing, and pulling away with force those that resisted their actions, including many of the women, children, servants and slaves. As the last of the men left the encampment, a war whoop sounded, and a contingent of Abenaki warriors seized several men at the rear of the column. alt=Montcalm is depicted wearing a uniform and three-cornered hat, facing an Indian who has raised a tomahawk over his head, as if to strike at Montcalm, while stepping over a wounded soldier. Bodies lie about, and an Indian is seen holding a white baby away from a woman who is trying to reach for it. Although Montcalm and other French officers attempted to stop further attacks, others did not, and some explicitly refused to provide further protection to the British. At this point, the column dissolved, as some tried to escape the Indian onslaught, while others actively tried to defend themselves. Massachusetts Colonel Joseph Frye reported that he was stripped of much of his clothing and repeatedly threatened. He fled into the woods, and did not reach Fort Edward until 12 August.Dodge, p. 92 Estimates of the numbers killed, wounded, and taken captive during this time vary widely. Ian Steele has compiled estimates ranging from 200 to 1,500. His detailed reconstruction of the siege and its aftermath indicates that the final tally of British missing and dead ranges from 69 to 184, at most 7.5% of the 2,308 who surrendered.Steele, p. 144 Aftermath alt=The reconstructed fort is a wooden log construction, painted brown, roughly a single story tall. There are four flagpoles, from which fly a variety of flags, including the American flag and a British Union Jack. Mountains are visible in the background. On the afternoon after the massacre, most of the Indians left, heading back to their homes. Montcalm was able to secure the release of 500 captives they had taken, but they still took with them another 200.Nester, pp. 61,64 The French remained at the site for several days, destroying what remained of the British works before leaving on 18 August and returning to Fort Carillon.Nester, p. 64 For unknown reasons, Montcalm decided not to follow up his victory with an attack on Fort Edward. Many reasons have been proposed justifying his decision, including the departure of many (but not all) of the Indians, a shortage of provisions, the lack of draft animals to assist in the portage to the Hudson, and the need for the Canadian militia to return home in time to participate in the harvest.Nester, p. 62 Word of the French movements had reached the influential British Indian agent William Johnson on 1 August. Unlike Webb, he acted with haste, and arrived at Fort Edward on 6 August with 1,500 militia and 150 Indians. In a move that infuriated Johnson, Webb refused to allow him to advance toward Fort William Henry, apparently believing a French deserter's report that the French army was 11,000 men strong, and that any attempt at relief was futile given the available forces.Nester, pp. 57‚Äì58 =Return of captives= On 14 August, Montcalm wrote letters to Loudoun and Webb, apologising for the behaviour of the Indians, but also attempting to justify it.Nester, p. 64 Many captives that were taken to Montreal by the Indians were also eventually repatriated through prisoner exchanges negotiated by Governor Vaudreuil. On 27 September a small British fleet left Quebec, carrying paroled or exchanged prisoners taken in a variety of actions including those at Fort William Henry and Oswego. When the fleet arrived at Halifax, about 300 people captured at Fort William Henry were returned to the colonies. The fleet continued to Europe, where a few more former captives were released; some of these also eventually returned to the colonies.Steele, pp. 135‚Äì138 =Consequences= General Webb was recalled because of his actions; William Johnson wrote that Webb was \\"the only Englishman [I] ever knew who was a coward.\\"Starbuck, p. 14 Lord Loudoun was also recalled, although this occurred primarily because of the failure of the Louisbourg expedition. Colonel Monro died in November 1757, of apoplexy that some historians have suggested was caused by anger over Webb's failure to support him. Lord Loudoun, upset over the event, delayed implementing the release of French prisoners promised as part of the terms of surrender. General James Abercrombie, who succeeded Loudoun as commander-in-chief, was asked by paroled members of the 35th Foot to void the agreement so that they would be free to serve in 1758; this he did, and they went on to serve under Jeffery Amherst in his successful British expedition against Louisbourg in 1758. Amherst, who also presided over the surrender of Montreal in 1760, refused the surrendering garrisons at Louisbourg and Montreal the normal honours of war, due in part to the French failure to uphold the terms of capitulation in this action.Steele, p. 145 Legacy alt=An open grassy area is strewn with bodies, most of them in red and white uniforms, although some with blue coats are visible farther back. In the distance there are white tents and a crowd of people, and a small thin cloud of smoke obscures the view a little. The British (and later Americans) never rebuilt anything on the site of Fort William Henry, which lay in ruins for about 200 years. In the 1950s, excavation at the site eventually led to the reconstruction of Fort William Henry as a tourist destination for the town of Lake George.Starbuck, p. 18 Many colonial accounts of the time focused on the plundering perpetrated by the Indians, and the fact that those who resisted them were killed, using words like \\"massacre\\" even though casualty numbers were uncertain. The later releases of captives did not receive the same level of press coverage.Steele, p. 151 The events of the battle and subsequent killings were depicted in the 1826 novel The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper and in film adaptations of the book. Cooper's description of the events contains numerous inaccuracies, but his work, and the sometimes lurid descriptions of the event by early historians like Benson Lossing and Francis Parkman, led to the belief that many more people died than actually did. Lossing wrote that \\"fifteen hundred [people] were butchered or carried into hopeless captivity\\", when many more were captured than killed, and even many of those captured were eventually freed.Starbuck, p. 15 alt=A black and white head-and-shoulders photographic portrait of Parkman. He faces to the right, sports long sideburns, and wears a dark suit and tie. The photograph has scratches and other damage. Historians disagree on where to assign responsibility for the Indian actions. Francis Jennings contends that Montcalm anticipated what was going to happen, deliberately ignored it when it did happen, and stepped in only after the atrocities were well under way. In his opinion, the account by Bougainville, who left for Montreal on the night of 9 August and was not present at the massacre, was written as a whitewash to protect Montcalm.Parkman, p. 523Jennings, pp. 316‚Äì318 Parkman is more vigorous in his defence of Montcalm, claiming that he and other French officers did what they could to prevent atrocities, but were powerless to stop the onslaught.Parkman, pp. 521‚Äì525 Ian Steele notes that two primary accounts dominate much of the historical record. The first is the record compiled by Montcalm, including the terms of surrender and his letters to Webb and Loudoun, which received wide publication in the colonies (both French and British) and in Europe. The second was the 1778 publication of a book by Jonathan Carver, an explorer who served in the Massachusetts militia and was present at the siege. According to Steele, Carver originated, without any supporting analysis or justification, the idea that as many as 1,500 people had been \\"killed or made prisoner\\" in his widely popular work.Steele, p. 159 Yale College president Timothy Dwight, in a history published posthumously in 1822, apparently coined the phrase \\"massacre at Fort William Henry\\", based on Carver's work; his book and Carver's were likely influences on Cooper, and tended to fault Montcalm for the Indian transgressions.Steele, pp. 167‚Äì168 Steele himself adopts a more nuanced view of the underlying cause of the massacre. Montcalm and the French leaders repeatedly promised the Indians opportunities for the glory and trophies of war, including plunder, scalping, and the taking of captives.Steele, p. 184 In the aftermath of the Battle of Sabbath Day Point, captives taken were ransomed, meaning the Indians had no visible trophies. The terms of surrender at Fort William Henry effectively denied the Indians appreciable opportunities for plunder: the war provisions were claimed by the French army, and personal effects of the British were to stay with them, leaving nothing for the Indians. According to Steele, this decision bred resentment, as it appeared that the French were conspiring with their enemies (the British) against their friends (the Indians), leaving them without any promised war trophies.Steele, p. 185 Participating Indian nations According to historian William Nester, many tribal nations were present during the siege. Some were represented by only a few individual warriors. Some individuals were thought to have traveled to join the French, coming from as far away as the Mississippi River and Hudson Bay. Nester proposed that some of the atrocities, which included the murder and scalping of sick individuals and the digging up of bodies for plunder and scalping, resulted in many Indians becoming infected with smallpox, which they then carried into their communities. The devastation wrought by the disease in the following years had a notable effect on Indian participation in the French campaigns of the following years.Nester, p. 61 The tribes that Nester lists are: * Abenaki * Algonquin * Fox * Huron * Iowa * Kickapoo tribe * \\"Canadian\\" Iroquois * Menominee * Miami * Mi'kmaq * Mississauga * Nipissing * Ojibwe * Onondaga * Ottawa * Potawatomi * Sac * Atikamekw \\"Tetes-de-Boules\\" * Winnebago Notes References   * Further reading  * External links * An account of two attacks on Fort William Henry * History of the 35th Foot in the French and Indian War Category:Conflicts in 1757 Category:1757 in North America Category:Battles in New York (state) Fort William Henry 1757 Fort William Henry 1757 Fort William Henry 1757 Category:Massacres by Native Americans Category:1757 in New York ","title":"Siege of Fort William Henry"},{"id":"2071855","text":"TTX Company (formerly TrailerTrain) is a provider of railcars and related freight car management services to the North American rail industry.

Owned by a number of large North American railroads, TTX's pools allow members to share capacity to reduce costs and risk. History TTX was founded in 1955 by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Norfolk and Western Railway, and Rail-Trailer Corporation. Pennsylvania Railroad employees - 6,000 in total - entered possible names in a drawing for the new company, and the name \\"Trailer Train\\" won. TrailerTrain's original goals were to standardize TOFC railcar practices, foster the growth of transportation, provide its members with the best available equipment at the lowest cost, and keep its members abreast of new developments. In 1991, the company changed its company name from TrailerTrain to TTX. TTX operates under pooling authority granted by the Surface Transportation Board (STB). The flatcar pool was first approved in 1974 and then reauthorized in 1989, 1994, 2004 and most recently on October 1, 2014 for a 15-year term. Fleet TTX's railcar fleet consists mainly of flatcars, autoracks, boxcars and gondolas. Half of the fleet is dedicated to flatcars and intermodal wells, with a quarter dedicated to auto racks for hauling finished vehicles. The remaining quarter of the pool includes boxcars, gondolas and specialized flatcars to carry a wide variety of general merchandise commodities. TTX provides standardized car types and re-purposes idle assets to serve a dynamic marketplace.

Traditionally, the district courts have sought to limit the operation of exclusion clauses. In addition to numerous common law rules limiting their operation, in England and Wales Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 applies to all contracts, but the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, unlike the common law rules, do differentiate between contracts between businesses and contracts between business and consumer, so the law seems to explicitly recognize the greater possibility of exploitation of the consumer by businesses. Types of exclusion clause There are various methods by which a party may seek to exclude or mitigate liability by use of a contractual term: * True exclusion clause: The clause recognizes a potential breach of contract, and then excuses liability for the breach. Alternatively, the clause is constructed in such a way it only includes reasonable care to perform duties on one of the parties. * Limitation clause: The clause places a limit on the amount that can be claimed for a breach of contract, regardless of the actual loss. * Time limitation: The clause states that an action for a claim must be commenced within a certain period of time or the cause of action becomes extinguished. Term must be incorporated The courts have traditionally held that exclusion clauses only operate if they are actually part of the contract. There seem to be three methods of incorporation: * Incorporation by signature: according to L'Estrange v Graucob,[1934] 2 KB 394 if the clause is written on a document which has been signed by all parties, then it is part of the contract. If a document has not been signed, any exception clause which it contains will only be incorporated if the party relying on the clause (the 'proferens') can show that he took reasonable steps to bring it to the attention of the other party before the contract was made. In somewhat of a contradiction, that is not to say that the proferens actually has to show that the other person read the clause or understood it (except where the clause is particularly unusual or onerous). It is not even necessary to show that the attention of that particular person was actually drawn to it. It is somewhat like the 'reasonable man' test in tort: the party trying to rely on the clause needs to take reasonable steps to bring it to the attention of the reasonable person. * Incorporation by notice: the general rule, as provided in Parker v SE Railway(1877) 4 CPD 416 is that an exclusion clause will have been incorporated into the contract if the person relying on it took reasonable steps to draw it to the other parties' attention. Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking[1971] 2 WLR 585 seems to indicate that the wider the clause, the more the party relying on it will have had to have done to bring it to the other parties' attention. The notice must be given before formation of the contract as illustrated in Olley v Marlborough Court Ltd.[1949] 1 All ER 127 * Incorporation by previous course of dealings: according to McCutcheon v David MacBrayne Ltd,[1964] 1 WLR 125 terms (including exclusion clauses) may be incorporated into a contract if course of dealings between the parties were \\"regular and consistent\\". What this means usually depends on the facts, however, the courts have indicated that equality of bargaining power between the parties may be taken into account. Judicial control of exclusion clauses =Strict literal interpretation= For an exclusion clause to operate, it must cover the breach (assuming there actually is a breach of contract). If there is, then the type of liability arising is also important. Generally, there are two varieties of liability: strict liability (liability arising due to a state of affairs without the party at breach necessarily being at fault) and liability for negligence (liability arising due to fault). The courts have a tendency of requiring the party relying on the clause to have drafted it properly so that it exempts them from the liability arising, and if any ambiguity is present, the courts usually interpret it strictly against the party relying on the clause. As espoused in Darlington Futures Ltd v Delco Australia Pty Ltd,(1986) 161 CLR 500 the meaning of an exclusion clause is construed in its ordinary and natural meaning in the context. Although we construe the meaning much like any other ordinary clause in the contract, we need to examine the clause in light of the contract as a whole. Exclusion clauses should not be subject to a strained construction in order to reduce the ambit of their operation.[1986] HCA 82 The judge in R&B; Customs Brokers Co Ltd v United Dominions Trust Ltd[1988] 1 All ER 847 refused to allow an exemption clause, of which did cover the nature of the implied term, on the grounds that it did not make specific and explicit reference to that term.The term in question was the implied term as to fitness-to-purpose pursuant to the Sale of Goods Act 1979 s14(3). =Contra proferentem= If, after attempting to construe an exclusion clause (or indeed any other contractual term) in accord with its ordinary and natural meaning of the words, there is still ambiguity then (if the clause was imposed by one party upon the other without negotiation) the contra proferentem rule applies. Essentially this means that the clause will be construed against the interests of the person who proposed its inclusion. that is to say, contra (against) the proferens (proposer).. In terms of negligence, the courts have taken the approach that it is unlikely that someone would enter into a contract that allows the other party to evade fault based liability. As a result, if a party wishes exempt his liability for negligence, he must make sure that the other parties understand that. The decision in Canada SS Lines Ltd v. The King[1952] AC 192 held that: * If the exclusion clauses mention \\"negligence\\" explicitly, then liability for negligence is excluded. * If \\"negligence\\" is not mentioned, then liability for negligence is excluded only if the words used in the exclusion clause are wide enough to exclude liability for negligence. If there is any ambiguity, then the contra proferentem rule applies. * If a claim on another basis can be made other than that of negligence, then it covers that basis instead. Contra proferentem in Australian contract law In Australia, the four corners rule has been adopted in preference over the idea of a \\"fundamental breach\\".. The court will presume that parties to a contract will not exclude liability for losses arising from acts not authorised under the contract. However, if acts of negligence occur during authorised acts, then the exclusion clauses shall still apply;: Clear words are necessary to exclude liability for negligence.. If the contract is for the carriage of goods, if the path is deviated from what was agreed, any exclusion clauses no longer apply. In Australia, exclusion clauses have been recognised as valid by the High Court. They do not apply in cases of deliberate breach. Statutory control Even if terms included in a contract are deemed to be exclusion or exemption clauses, various jurisdictions have enacted statutory controls, to limit the their effect. In Australia, ACL, Section 64 limits exclusion clauses from rendering them from being ineffective against the guarantees of the same act. In the United Kingdom, the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 renders many exemption clauses ineffective. The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 provide further protection for consumers.

This means that it does not assume any pre-existing arena (dimensional space), but rather attempts to show how the spacetime fabric itself evolves. There is evidence that at large scales CDT approximates the familiar 4-dimensional spacetime, but shows spacetime to be 2-dimensional near the Planck scale, and reveals a fractal structure on slices of constant time. These interesting results agree with the findings of Lauscher and Reuter, who use an approach called Quantum Einstein Gravity, and with other recent theoretical work.  Introduction  Near the Planck scale, the structure of spacetime itself is supposed to be constantly changing due to quantum fluctuations and topological fluctuations. CDT theory uses a triangulation process which varies dynamically and follows deterministic rules, to map out how this can evolve into dimensional spaces similar to that of our universe. The results of researchers suggest that this is a good way to model the early universe, and describe its evolution. Using a structure called a simplex, it divides spacetime into tiny triangular sections. A simplex is the multidimensional analogue of a triangle [2-simplex]; a 3-simplex is usually called a tetrahedron, while the 4-simplex, which is the basic building block in this theory, is also known as the pentachoron. Each simplex is geometrically flat, but simplices can be \\"glued\\" together in a variety of ways to create curved spacetimes, where previous attempts at triangulation of quantum spaces have produced jumbled universes with far too many dimensions, or minimal universes with too few. CDT avoids this problem by allowing only those configurations in which the timelines of all joined edges of simplices agree.  Derivation  CDT is a modification of quantum Regge calculus where spacetime is discretized by approximating it with a piecewise linear manifold in a process called triangulation. In this process, a d-dimensional spacetime is considered as formed by space slices that are labeled by a discrete time variable t. Each space slice is approximated by a simplicial manifold composed by regular (d ‚àí 1)-dimensional simplices and the connection between these slices is made by a piecewise linear manifold of d-simplices. In place of a smooth manifold there is a network of triangulation nodes, where space is locally flat (within each simplex) but globally curved, as with the individual faces and the overall surface of a geodesic dome. The line segments which make up each triangle can represent either a space-like or time-like extent, depending on whether they lie on a given time slice, or connect a vertex at time t with one at time t + 1. The crucial development is that the network of simplices is constrained to evolve in a way that preserves causality. This allows a path integral to be calculated non-perturbatively, by summation of all possible (allowed) configurations of the simplices, and correspondingly, of all possible spatial geometries. Simply put, each individual simplex is like a building block of spacetime, but the edges that have a time arrow must agree in direction, wherever the edges are joined. This rule preserves causality, a feature missing from previous \\"triangulation\\" theories. When simplexes are joined in this way, the complex evolves in an orderly fashion, and eventually creates the observed framework of dimensions. CDT builds upon the earlier work of Barrett, Crane, and Baez, but by introducing the causality constraint as a fundamental rule (influencing the process from the very start), Loll, Ambj√∏rn, and Jurkiewicz created something different.  Advantages and disadvantages  CDT derives the observed nature and properties of spacetime from a small set of assumptions, without adjusting factors. The idea of deriving what is observed from first principles is very attractive to physicists. CDT models the character of spacetime both in the ultra- microscopic realm near the Planck scale, and at the scale of the cosmos, so CDT may provide insights into the nature of reality. Evaluation of the observable implications of CDT relies heavily on Monte Carlo simulation by computer. Some feel that this makes CDT an inelegant quantum gravity theory. Also, it has been argued that discrete time-slicing may not accurately reproduce all possible modes of a dynamical system. However, research by Markopoulou and Smolin demonstrates that the cause for those concerns may be limited. Therefore, many physicists still regard this line of reasoning as promising.  Related theories  CDT has some similarities with loop quantum gravity, especially with its spin foam formulations. For example, the Lorentzian Barrett‚ÄìCrane model is essentially a non-perturbative prescription for computing path integrals, just like CDT. There are important differences, however. Spin foam formulations of quantum gravity use different degrees of freedom and different Lagrangians. For example, in CDT, the distance, or \\"the interval\\", between any two points in a given triangulation can be calculated exactly (triangulations are eigenstates of the distance operator). This is not true for spin foams or loop quantum gravity in general. Another approach to quantum gravity that is closely related to causal dynamical triangulation is called causal sets. Both CDT and causal sets attempt to model the spacetime with a discrete causal structure. The main difference between the two is that the causal set approach is relatively general, whereas CDT assumes a more specific relationship between the lattice of spacetime events and geometry. Consequently, the Lagrangian of CDT is constrained by the initial assumptions to the extent that it can be written down explicitly and analyzed (see, for example, hep-th/0505154, page 5), whereas there is more freedom in how one might write down an action for causal-set theory.

Within the park are Rodeo Ranch Museum, Homestead museum, Sitting Bull monument, Ball Diamonds, campsites, play area, concessions, swimming pool, hiking and bicycling trails. This is a local park administered by local funding.  History  The North West Mountain Police were sent to the Wood Mountain area to establish the Queen's Law in the frontier west of early Canada. It was the 1870s, and Sitting Bull had led his large Sioux tribe away from The Little Big Horn after defeating Custer's incursion upon their native land. The Canadian government was concerned that the Sioux would cause problems, and charged Walsh of the NWMP with maintaining control of what amounted to Canada's first attempted peace keeping mission. Walsh succeeded, as he and Sitting Bull became close friends over the years, and there were never any serious problems caused by the Native American settlers. Members of the tribe remain in the Wood Mountain area to this day, including several families who live on the Wood Mountain First Nations reserve. In 1890 the Wood Mountain Stampede was established, and it became an annual event held even through the World War years of 1914-1918 and 1939‚Äì1945, which has allowed it to attain the title of the longest-running annual rodeo in Canada.

The district includes the majority of Fort Bend County, including most of the cities of Sugar Land, Missouri City, Rosenberg, Needville and the county seat of Richmond as well as the county's share of the largely unincorporated Greater Katy area west of Houston. In addition, the district also contains portions of northern Brazoria County, including Pearland and Alvin, as well as a small portion of southeast Harris County centered on Friendswood. The district is represented by Republican Pete Olson, who was elected in 2008 over one-term incumbent Democrat Nick Lampson. Before 2006, the district had been represented by former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay since 1985, and before that, former Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul briefly in 1976 and again from 1979 to 1985. In 2006, 52% of poll respondents identified as Republicans, 32% as Democrats, and 16% as independents. The Cook Partisan Voting Index, which derives its data from the two most recent presidential elections, gives the district a 10-point Republican lean compared to the national average. In 2020, Sri Preston Kulkarni, the 2018 Democratic nominee for this seat, will compete again for this seat, this time against Republican nominee and Fort Bend County sheriff Troy Nehls.  History  The district was originally created in 1958, replacing the abolished at-large district represented by Democrat Martin Dies, Jr. from 1953 to 1959. At the time, all of Texas's 254 counties had representation by one collective member of Congress. The new district was placed in Harris County, home to the city of Houston and previously represented in its entirely by Democrat Albert Thomas in the state's 8th congressional district, making Harris the first county in Texas since World War II to be divided into more than one congressional district. The new 22nd district, largely made up of suburban territory outside of Houston along with southern portions of the city itself, was won by Democrat Robert R. Casey, a former Harris County Judge (a post equivalent to that of a county executive in Texas). The 8th and 22nd districts were separated by a boundary consisting roughly of what is now U.S. 290, the western and southern portions of Loop 610, and the portion of Buffalo Bayou east of downtown Houston including the Houston Ship Channel. All points south of this boundary were in the 22nd, while the remainder was in the 8th. These boundaries would remain effective until the 1964 elections. After a federal court in Houston ruled Texas' congressional redistricting practices as unconstitutional in Bush v. Martin, effective with the 1966 elections, Harris County was realigned into three separate congressional districts ‚Äî the existing 8th and 22nd districts, plus the newly realigned 7th district on the west side of Houston and Harris County. The new 7th would elect former Harris County Republican Party chairman (and future President) George H. W. Bush, while Casey's 22nd district was made the most compact of the three, stretching from southwest Houston to southeast Harris County, including Pasadena and Clear Lake City, and also encompassing the Johnson Space Center. The district was not realigned until following the 1970 Census. Beginning with the 1972 elections, the 22nd district lost some largely African-American portions to the newly realigned, majority African- American 18th district (which would elect Democrat Barbara Jordan), while other areas along the Houston Ship Channel went to the 8th district, now represented by Democrat Bob Eckhardt and primarily concentrated in north Houston. Those areas were replaced by rapidly growing Fort Bend and Brazoria counties, home to growing Republican constituencies of white upper-middle- class families ‚Äî natives and transplants alike ‚Äî moving to jobs in Houston's growing energy sector, as well as at the Johnson Space Center and the Texas Medical Center, and drawn to affordable housing and top-rated schools in the area's burgeoning master-planned communities. A mid-decade redistricting in 1974 added southern Waller County, with a similar character to Fort Bend and Brazoria. As with most growing exurban areas in the Southern United States, these new areas also had large blocs of conservative white Democrats disenchanted with their party's support for restoration of civil rights promoted by the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson and the national Democratic Party. While Casey continued to win reelection in 1972 and 1974 without significant opposition, his resignation following his appointment to the Federal Maritime Commission in 1976, combined with increased suburban growth in the aforementioned counties, opened the door for a Republican upset in the special election that followed. Months after Casey's resignation, on April 3, 1976, Republican Ron Paul, a physician and Air Force veteran who had moved from the Pittsburgh area in the previous decade with his wife and settled in Brazoria County, won a special election to fill the remainder of Casey's unexpired term. While Paul lost the general election later that year to Democratic State Senator Bob Gammage by fewer than 300 votes, in 1978 he defeated Gammage in a general election rematch by a 1,200-vote margin, coinciding with the election of Bill Clements as Texas's first Republican Governor since Reconstruction. In 1980, Paul would go on to win a second term, defeating Democratic attorney Mike Andrews, a former Harris County prosecutor, by a narrow margin. Following the 1980 Census, rapid growth in the Houston area resulted in most of the Harris County portion of the 22nd being transferred to the new 25th congressional district, which Mike Andrews won in 1982 and would hold for six terms before pursuing an unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in 1994. The redistricting left Paul with a district comprising three major portions, all of which were strongly Republican. These included: * all of Fort Bend County, by this time a booming suburban county anchored by the development of the First Colony master-planned community in Sugar Land, and also containing other booming suburbs including Missouri City, Stafford and Rosenberg. * much of Paul's political base in Brazoria County, except for a tiny western portion around the communities of Sweeny and West Columbia located in the adjacent 14th district; and * most of southwest Houston and Harris County along the Southwest Freeway, including the Westwood, Sharpstown and Fondren areas of Houston. This portion also included the Richmond Avenue entertainment corridor, The Galleria and the adjacent Transco Tower, the inner suburbs of Bellaire and West University Place, Houston Baptist University, and Greenway Plaza including The Summit (then the home of the NBA's Houston Rockets). Much of the area's retail activity, centered on the aforementioned Galleria as well as the Sharpstown and Westwood malls, along with most of southwest Houston's automotive dealerships (some of them among the top dealers in the nation), was also concentrated in the Harris County portion of the district and extended as far south as Stafford (then home to a major manufacturing facility for Texas Instruments). This configuration would remain in effect for the remainder of the 1980s, including the first four terms of Republican Tom DeLay's tenure, as Paul unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for the United States Senate in 1984 against eventual winner Phil Gramm. DeLay served as President of the conservative Republican Study Committee and became a Republican whip while representing this configuration of the district. Following the 1990 Census, the 22nd district was redrawn to take in all of Fort Bend County, all of Brazoria County save for its western and southern edges, and a small portion of southwest Houston in Harris County around the Alief, Westchase and Sharpstown areas. The district was further realigned after the 2000 Census, taking effect after the 2002 elections, when DeLay was re-elected and became House Majority Leader. The district maintained its share of both Fort Bend and Brazoria counties (save for Fort Bend's share of the city of Houston), while also gaining a large portion of southeast Harris County, including portions of Clear Lake City, Pasadena, La Porte, Deer Park and Seabrook. In 2003, following the Republican takeover of the Texas House of Representatives, the Texas Legislature engineered a mid-decade redistricting. The 22nd lost its share of Brazoria County except for Pearland, as well as communities on Fort Bend County's northern and western edges, to the 14th district. That district was now represented by Paul, who was elected and returned to Congress in 1997 after a 12-year absence. The 22nd district now included Pearland, almost all of southeast Harris County, including the Johnson Space Center, and a largely working-class western portion of Galveston County, including Santa Fe and La Marque, in addition to much of DeLay's political base in Sugar Land, Missouri City, Rosenberg and surrounding areas. The district would remain unchanged through the rest of the decade, but changed its incumbent three times after Tom DeLay resigned on June 9, 2006 in the wake of corruption allegations related to the 2003 redistricting. As the result of a special election on November 7, 2006 to fill DeLay's vacant congressional seat, Republican Shelley Sekula-Gibbs filled the remainder of DeLay's term in late 2006, having lost the general election to Democrat Nick Lampson in a bizarre set of circumstances. Lampson had previously represented Texas's 9th congressional district, based in Beaumont and Galveston, before the 2003 redistricting resulted in that district being renumbered as the 2nd district and pushed into heavily Republican northern Houston. Lampson was defeated in the 2004 election by Republican Harris County district court judge Ted Poe. Ahead of the 2006 election, Lampson moved to Stafford, where his grandparents had settled after they immigrated from Italy. Additionally, the 22nd included a large slice of his former base; he'd previously represented much of the Galveston County portion of the district, as well as the area around the Johnson Space Center. Lampson benefited from Sekula-Gibbs being forced to run a write-in campaign, as DeLay had resigned one month after winning a contentious Republican primary against three challengers (one of whom won over 20 percent of the vote, but not enough to overcome DeLay's vote of over 60 percent). After just one term and despite a vigorous campaign, Lampson lost the seat to Republican Pete Olson in 2008, who has held the seat since, often winning with double-digit margins. However in 2018, Olson narrowly won a sixth term in a surprisingly close race against Democrat Sri Preston Kulkarni fueled by Democratic coattails (mostly involving straight ticket voting) from the Senate campaign of Beto O'Rourke, who won Fort Bend County and narrowly lost the 22nd district in his unsuccessful, but close bid against incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz. Since 2013, the district has included most of Fort Bend County, save for most of the communities of Stafford, Mission Bend, Fresno, northern Missouri City and the Fort Bend Houston \\"super neighborhood\\" in far southwest Houston. Also within the district lie northern parts of Brazoria County, including Pearland and Alvin, and portions of southeast Houston and Harris County running along Interstate 45 south of the Sam Houston Tollway. The affluent residents of the district tends to vote strongly Republican and has an average median household income of $82,899 as of the 2012 American Community Survey. It is the wealthiest congressional district in Texas and also a diverse district with sizable minority constituencies, who are educated and of the professional class. Mitt Romney won the district with 62% of the vote in 2012, with Republicans holding the overwhelming majority of elected offices in the district. The district also voted for Donald Trump in 2016 despite Hillary Clinton becoming the first Democrat to carry Fort Bend County since 1964. Democratic strength within the district is largely concentrated in heavily Hispanic communities in Rosenberg, along with some parts of Missouri City, where the African-American population exceeds one-third, and western precincts in Pearland; these favored Barack Obama with around 50-60% of the vote. But these voting blocs are outnumbered by large blocs of suburban Republican voters in much of the district, including groups of moderate-leaning ethnic Asian voters centered on Sugar Land, along with some conservative-leaning Hispanic and African-American voters in more affluent parts of the district. Still, due to Fort Bend County's recent status as a classic suburban \\"swing county\\" in state and national politics, as well as Democratic gains at the local level in the 2018 elections, many observers speculate that this district is likely to be competitive in future elections.  Demographics  According to the APM Research Lab's Voter Profile Tools (featuring the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Community Survey), the district contained about 611,000 potential voters (citizens, age 18+). Of these, 54% are White, 23% Latino, 16% Black, and 16% Asian. Immigrants make up 22% of the district's potential voters. Median income among households (with one or more potential voter) is about $102,500. As for the educational attainment of potential voters in the district, 42% hold a bachelor's or higher degree.

Casey defeated ob/gyn Ron Paul, a delegate to the Texas Republican convention; Democrats won 1974 heavily. = 1976 special = After President Gerald Ford appointed Casey to head the Federal Maritime Commission, Paul won a 1976 special election against Democrat Robert Gammage to fill the empty seat; Paul was sworn in on April 3. Paul had decided to enter politics on August 15, 1971, when President Richard Nixon closed the \\"gold window\\" by implementing the U.S. dollar's complete departure from the gold standard. Paul was the first Republican elected from the area since Reconstruction, and the first from the state since Bill Guill was elected from the 14th congressional district in 1950. He led the Texas Reagan delegation at the national Republican convention. His successful campaign against Gammage surprised local Democrats, who had expected to retain the seat easily following the Watergate scandal of President Richard Nixon. Gammage underestimated Paul's support among local women. = 1976 general = Gammage narrowly defeated Paul some months later in the general election, by fewer than 300 votes (0.2%). = 1978 = Paul defeated Gammage in a 1978 rematch. Paul would go on to win the 1980 and 1982 elections as well. = 1984 = In 1984, Paul chose to run for the U.S. Senate instead of re-election to the House. He was succeeded by former state representative and Republican Tom DeLay. DeLay would go on to win re- election from 1986 through 2004. = 2004 = = 2006 special = On January 2, 2006, Nick Lampson, a Jefferson County tax assessor-collector, filed as a Democrat to challenge incumbent Tom DeLay for the 2006 general election. Lampson had represented the adjacent until DeLay engineered the 2003 Texas redistricting, after which Lampson lost his seat to Republican Ted Poe in 2004. DeLay won the Republican primary on March 7, 2006, taking 62% of the vote in the four-way race. It was DeLay's weakest showing in a primary election, which prompted doubts about whether he could win the general election. On April 3, 2006, three days after his former aide Tony Rudy pleaded guilty to various charges of corruption relating to the Jack Abramoff scandal, DeLay announced that he would withdraw from the race. Under Texas law, it was too late for the Republican Party to select another candidate for the ballot of the 2006 general election. DeLay announced on August 8, 2006 that he would withdraw in order to allow the party to organize a campaign for a write-in candidate. Texas Governor Rick Perry announced on August 29, 2006 that a special election would take place for the remainder of DeLay's term (November 2006 to January 2007). The Texas Republican Party supported Houston City Councilwoman Shelley Sekula-Gibbs as their write-in candidate. Lampson chose not to run in the special election. Sekula-Gibbs won and was sworn in on November 13, 2006. She represented the district for the remaining few weeks of the 109th United States Congress. Sekula-Gibbs promised to fix health care, taxes, and immigration. = 2006 general = Due to DeLay's late announcement, no Republican was listed on the ballot for the two-year term that began in January 2007. The special election was held concurrently with the general election on November 7, 2006. Voters cast votes twice on that date, once for the special election, once for the general election. This arrangement ensured that Sekula-Gibbs's name appeared on a November 7 ballot. Nonetheless, Lampson won the general election and was sworn in on January 4, 2007. = 2008 = Democratic incumbent Nick Lampson sought re-election. The Republican primary was highly competitive, as Lampson's prior victory was seen as the result of Republicans being forced to run a write-in campaign. Former incumbent Shelley Sekula-Gibbs, former Navy pilot and former Senate liaison officer Pete Olson, state representative Robert Talton, former councilman and mayor of Pasadena John Manlove, and former councilman and mayor of Sugar Land Dean Hrbacek all competed in the primary. No candidate won the primary outright, leading to a run-off campaign between the top two finishers, Sekula-Gibbs and Olson. Olson won the run-off and the nomination. Olson and Lampson faced each other in the November 4, 2008 general election, along with Libertarian candidate, Vietnam veteran, retired businessman, and community volunteer John Wieder. Olson won the election and was sworn into office in January 2009. = 2010 = Republican incumbent Pete Olson sought re-election and defeated Democrat Kesha Rogers, a LaRouche Movement supporter, in the general election on November 2, 2010. = 2012 = Two-term Republican incumbent Pete Olson sought re- election. He was challenged in the primary by conservative newspaper columnist Barbara Carlson, winning 76 percent of the vote. Kesha Rogers, a political activist with ties to the Lyndon LaRouche movement and the 2010 Democratic nominee, narrowly won the Democratic Party's nomination by 103 votes. Rogers was disavowed by some local Democrats for her controversial platform, which included impeaching President Barack Obama and colonizing outer space. Steven Susman again ran as the Libertarian candidate, and Don Cook ran as the Green Party candidate. Olson won the general election with 64% of the vote. = 2014 = Three-term incumbent Republican Pete Olson sought re-election. Frank Briscoe and Mark Gibson ran for the Democratic Party's nomination; Briscoe won the primary. Libertarian Rob Lapham competed with Olson and Briscoe in the general election. Olson was re-elected with 66.55% of the vote. = 2016 = Four-term incumbent Republican Pete Olson sought re-election. In the Democratic primary, Mark Gibson, who lost in the primary in 2014, and A. R. Hassan competed for the party's nomination; Gibson won the nomination with 76.16% of the vote. Olson was re-elected with 59.52% of the vote in the general election. = 2018 = Five-term incumbent Republican Pete Olson sought re-election. In the Democratic primary, several candidates competed for the nomination, including former diplomat Sri Preston Kulkarni, dentist Letitia Plummer, and 2016 nominee Mark Gibson. No candidate won the Democratic nomination outright, leading to a run-off election between the top two finishers, Kulkarni and Plummer. Kulkarni won the run-off with 62% of the vote, and faced Olson, Libertarian John McElligott, and independent candidate Sara Kellen Sweney in the general election. Olson won the general election with 51.4% of the vote, his closest-ever victory. = 2020 = Six-term incumbent Republican Pete Olson announced he would not seek re-election in 2020, opening up a competitive contest for both major parties. On the Democratic side, 2018 nominee Sri Preston Kulkarni won the nomination again in the March 3 primary, while on the Republican side a large number of candidates ran, including Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nehls, GOP donor Kathaleen Wall, and Pierce Bush, a member of the Bush family. No candidate won the Republican primary outright, initiating a run-off contest between the top two finishers, Troy Nehls and Kathaleen Wall. Nehls defeated Wall in the July 14 run-off to win the nomination. Nehls and Kulkarni will compete in the November election for the seat, alongside Libertarian candidate Joseph LeBlanc Jr.  See also  * List of United States congressional districts  References   Congressional Biographical Directory of the United States 1774‚Äìpresent Category:Brazoria County, Texas 22 Category:Fort Bend County, Texas Category:Galveston County, Texas Category:Harris County, Texas ","title":"Texas's 22nd congressional district"},{"id":"2071926","text":"Taposa was an American Indian tribe located in the south of the United States, originating from the area that is now the state of Mississippi.Indian Tribe History Their earliest known location was on Yazoo River, near the Chakchiuma and Chickasaw tribes.Mississippi Indian TribesThe Indian Tribes of North America By John Reed Swanton The original meaning of the name \\"Taposa\\" has been lost.

They ruled much of the Bundelkhand region (then called Jejakabhukti) between the 9th and the 13th centuries. Their identity as Rajputs became more pronounced in 12th century around Ghurid invasions. The Chandelas initially ruled as feudatories of the Gurjara-Pratiharas of Kanyakubja (Kannauj). The 10th century Chandela ruler Yashovarman became practically independent, although he continued to acknowledge the Pratihara suzerainty. By the time of his successor Dhanga the Chandelas had become a sovereign power. Their power rose and declined as they fought battles with the neighbouring dynasties, especially the Paramaras of Malwa and the Kalachuris of Tripuri. From the 11th century onwards, the Chandelas faced raids by the northern Muslim dynasties, including the Ghaznavids and the Ghurids. The Chandela power effectively ended around the beginning of the 13th century, following Chahamana and Ghurid invasions. The Chandelas are well known for their art and architecture, most notably for the temples at their original capital Khajuraho.They built a very grand temple of Lord Chitragupta in Khajuraho. They also commissioned a number of temples, water bodies, palaces and forts at other places, including their strongholds of Ajaigarh, Kalinjar and their later capital Mahoba.  Origin  The origin of the Chandelas is obscured by mythical legends. The epigraphic records of the dynasty, as well as contemporary texts such as Balabhadra- vilasa and Prabodha-chandrodaya, suggest that the Chandelas belonged to the legendary Lunar dynasty (Chandravansha). A 954 CE Khajuraho inscription states that the dynasty's first king Nannuka was a descendant of sage Chandratreya, who was a son of Atri. A 1002 CE Khajuraho inscription gives a slightly different account, in which Chandratreya is mentioned as a son of Indu (the Moon) and a grandson of Atri. The 1195 CE Baghari inscription and the 1260 CE Ajaygadh inscription contain similar mythical accounts. The Balabhadra-vilasa also names Atri among the ancestors of the Chandelas. Another Khajuraho inscription describes the Chandela king Dhanga worshipping Krsna and Nand- Yashoda of the Vrishni clan of the Yadavas (who also claimed to be part of the Lunar dynasty). The later medieval texts include Chandelas among the 36 Rajput clans. These include Mahoba-Khanda, Varna Ratnakara, Prithviraj Raso and Kumarapala-charita. The Mahoba-Khanda legend of the dynasty's origin goes like this: Hemaraja, a priest of the Gaharwar king of Benares, had a beautiful daughter named Hemavati. Once, while Hemavati was bathing in a pond, the moon god Chandra saw her and made love to her. Hemavati was worried about the dishonour of being an unwed mother, but Chandra assured her that their son would become a great king. This child was the dynasty's progenitor Chandravarma. Chandra presented him with a philosopher's stone and taught him politics. The dynasty's own records do not mention Hemavati, Hemaraja or Indrajit. Such legends appear to be later bardic inventions. In general, the Mahoba-Khanda is a historically unreliable text. British indologist V. A. Smith theorized that the Chandelas were of either Bhar or Gond origin. Some other scholars including R. C. Majumdar also supported this theory. The Chandelas worshipped Maniya, a tribal goddess, whose temples are located at Mahoba and Maniyagadh. Besides, they have been associated with places that are also associated with Bhars and Gonds. Also, Rani Durgavati, whose family claimed Chandela descent married a Gond chief of Garha-Mandla. Historian R. K. Dikshit does not find these arguments convincing: he argues that Maniya was not a tribal deity. Also, the dynasty's association with Gond territory is not necessarily indicative of a common descent: the dynasty's progenitor may have been posted as a governor in these territories. Finally, Durgavati's marriage to a Gond chief can be dismissed as a one-off case. History = Early rulers = The Chandelas were originally vassals of the Gurjara- Pratiharas.Radhey Shyam Chaurasia, History of Ancient India: Earliest Times to 1000 A. D. Nannuka (r. c. 831-845 CE), the founder of the dynasty, was the ruler of a small kingdom centered around Khajuraho. According to the Chandela inscriptions, Nannuka's successor Vakpati defeated several enemies. Vakpati's sons Jayashakti (Jeja) and Vijayashakti (Vija) consolidated the Chandela power. According to a Mahoba inscription, the Chandela territory was named \\"Jejakabhukti\\" after the Jayashakti. Vijayashakti's successor Rahila is credited with several military victories in eulogistic inscriptions. Rahila's son Harsha played an important role in restoring the rule of the Pratihara king Mahipala, possibly after a Rashtrakuta invasion or after Mahiapala's conflict with his step-brother Bhoja II. = Rise as a sovereign power = Harsha's son Yashovarman (r. c. 925-950 CE) continued to acknowledge the Pratihara suzerainty, but became practically independent. He conquered the important fortress of Kalanjara. A 953-954 CE Khajuraho inscription credits him with several other military successes, including against Gaudas (identified with the Palas), the Khasas, the Chedis (the Kalachuris of Tripuri), the Kosalas (possibly the Somavamshis), the Mithila (possibly a small tributary ruler), Malavas (identified with the Paramaras), the Kurus, the Kashmiris and the Gurjaras. These claims appear to be exaggerated, as similar claims of extensive conquests in northern India are also found in the records of the other contemporary kings such as the Kalachuri king Yuva-Raja and the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III. Yashovarman's reign marked the beginning of the famous Chandela-era art and architecture. He commissioned the Lakshmana Temple at Khajuraho. Unlike the earlier Chandela inscriptions, the records of Yashovarman's successor Dhanga (r. c. 950-999 CE) do not mention any Pratihara overlord. This indicates that Dhanga formally established the Chandela sovereignty. A Khajuraho inscription claims that the rulers of Kosala, Kratha (part of Vidarbha region), Kuntala, and Simhala listened humbly to the commands of Dhanga's officers. It also claims that the wives of the kings of Andhra, Anga, Kanchi and Ra·∏çha resided in his prisons as a result of his success in wars. These appear to be eulogistic exaggerations by a court poet, but suggest that Dhanga did undertake extensive military campaigns. Like his predecessor, Dhanga also commissioned a magnificent temple at Khajuraho, which is identified as the Vishvanatha Temple. Dhanga's successor Ganda appears to have retained the territory he inherited. His son Vidyadhara killed the Pratihara king of Kannauj (possibly Rajyapala) for fleeing his capital instead of fighting the Ghaznavid invader Mahmud of Ghazni. Mahmud later invaded Vidyadhara's kingdom; according to the Muslim invaders, this conflict ended with Vidyadhara paying tribute to Mahmud. Vidyadhara is noted for having commissioned the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple. The Chandela art and architecture reached its zenith during this period. The Lakshmana Temple (c. 930‚Äì950 CE), the Vishvanatha Temple (c. 999-1002 CE) and the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple (c. 1030 CE) were constructed during the reigns of Yashovarman, Dhanga and Vidyadhara respectively. These Nagara-style temples are representative of the most fully developed style at Khajuraho.

Taking advantage of this, the Kalachuri king Gangeya-deva conquered eastern parts of the kingdom. Chandela inscriptions suggest that Vidyadhara's successor Vijayapala (r. c. 1035-1050 CE) defeated Gangeya in a battle. However, the Chandela power started declining during the Vijayapala's reign. The Kachchhapaghatas of Gwalior probably gave up their allegiance to the Chandelas during this period. Vijayapala's elder son Devavavarman was subjugated by Gangeya's son Lakshmi-Karna. His younger brother Kirttivarman resurrected the Chandela power by defeating Lakshmi-Karna. Kirtivarman's son Sallakshanavarman achieved military successes against the Paramaras and the Kalachuris, possibly by raiding their territories. A Mau inscription suggests that he also conducted successful campaigns in the Antarvedi region (the Ganga-Yamuna doab). His son Jayavarman was of religious temperament and abdicated the throne after being tired of governance. Jayavarman appears to have died heirless, as he was succeeded by his uncle Prithvivarman, the younger son of Kirttivarman. The Chandela inscriptions do not ascribe any military achievements to him; it appears that he was focused on maintaining the existing Chandela territories without adopting an aggressive expansionist policy. = Revival = By the time Prithvivarman's son Madanavarman (r. c. 1128‚Äì1165 CE) ascended the throne, the neighbouring Kalachuri and Paramara kingdoms had been weakened by enemy invasions. Taking advantage of this situation, Madanavarman defeated the Kalachuri king Gaya-Karna, and possibly annexed the northern part of the Baghelkhand region. However, the Chandelas lost this territory to Gaya-Karna's successor Narasimha. Madanavarman also captured the territory on the western periphery of the Paramara kingdom, around Bhilsa (Vidisha). This probably happened during the reign of the Paramara king Yashovarman or his son Jayavarman. Once again, the Chandelas could not retain the newly annexed territory for long, and the region was recaptured by Yashovarman's son Lakshmivarman. Jayasimha Siddharaja, the Chaulukya king of Gujarat, also invaded the Paramara territory, which was located between the Chandela and the Chaulukya kingdoms. This brought him in conflict with Madanavarman. The result of this conflict appears to have been inconclusive, as records of both the kingdoms claim victory. A Kalanjara inscription suggests that Madanavarman defeated Jayasimha. On the other hand, the various chronicles of Gujarat claim that Jayasimha either defeated Madanavarman or extracted a tribute from him. Madanavarman maintained friendly relations with his northern neighbours, the Gahadavalas. Madanavarman's son Yashovarman II either did not rule, or ruled for a very short time. Madanavarman's grandson Paramardi-deva was the last powerful Chandela king. = Final decline = Paramardi (reigned c. 1165-1203 CE) ascended the Chandela throne at a young age. While the early years of his reign were peaceful, around 1182-1183 CE, the Chahamana ruler Prithviraj Chauhan invaded the Chandela kingdom. According to the medieval legendary ballads, Prithviraj's army lost its way after a surprise attack by Turkic forces, and unknowingly camped at the Chandela capital Mahoba. This led to a brief conflict between the Chandelas and the Chauhans, before Prithviraj left for Delhi. Sometime later, Prithviraj invaded the Chandela kingdom and sacked Mahoba. Paramardi cowardly took shelter in the Kalanjara fort. The Chandela force, led by Alha, Udal and other generals, was defeated in this battle. According to the various ballads, Paramardi either committed suicide out of shame or retired to Gaya. Prithviraj Chauhan's raid of Mahoba is corroborated by his Madanpur stone inscriptions. However, there are several instances of historical inaccuracies in the bardic legends. For example, it is known that Paramardi did not retire or die immediately after the Chauhan victory. He restored the Chandela power, and ruled as a sovereign until around 1202-1203 CE, when the Ghurid governor of Delhi invaded the Chandela kingdom. According to Taj-ul-Maasir, a chronicle of the Delhi Sultanate, Paramardi surrendered to the Delhi forces. He promised to pay tribute to the Sultan, but died before he could keep this promise. His dewan offered some resistance to the invading forces, but was ultimately subdued. The 16th century historian Firishta states that Paramardi was assassinated by his own minister, who disagreed with the king's decision to surrender to the Delhi forces. The Chandela power did not fully recover from their defeat against the Delhi forces. Paramardi was succeeded by Trailokyavarman, Viravarman and Bhojavarman. The next ruler Hammiravarman (r. c. 1288-1311 CE) did not use the imperial title Maharajadhiraja, which indicates that the Chandela king had a lower status by his time. The Chandela power continued to decline because of the rising Muslim influence, as well as the rise of other local dynasties, such as the Bundelas, the Baghelas and the Khangars. Hammiravarman was succeeded by Viravarman II, whose titles do not indicate a high political status. One minor branch of the family continued ruling Kalanjara: its ruler was killed by Sher Shah Suri's army in 1545 CE. Another minor branch ruled at Mahoba: Durgavati, one of its princesses married into the Gond royal family of Mandla. Some other ruling families also claimed Chandela descent (see Chandel).  Art and architecture  The Chandelas are well known for their art and architecture. They commissioned a number of temples, water bodies, palaces and forts at various places. The most famous example of their cultural achievements are the Hindu and Jain temples at Khajuraho.

A phosphoric acid, in the general sense, is a phosphorus oxoacid in which each phosphorus atom is in the oxidation state +5, and is bonded to four oxygen atoms, one of them through a double bond, arranged as the corners of a tetrahedron. Two or more of these tetrahedra may be connected by shared single-bonded oxygens, forming linear or branched chains, cycles, or more complex structures. The single-bonded oxygen atoms that are not shared are completed with acidic hydrogen atoms. The general formula of a phosphoric acid is Hn+2‚àí2xPnO3n+1‚àíx, where n is the number of phosphorus atoms and x is the number of fundamental cycles in the molecule's structure, between 0 and (n+2)/2. Pyrophosphate anion. Trimethyl orthophosphate. Removal of protons from k hydroxyl groups ‚ÄìOH leaves anions generically called phosphates (if k = n‚àí2x+2) or hydrogen phosphates (if k is between 1 and n‚àí2x+1), with general formula [Hn‚àí2x+2‚àíkPnO3n+1‚àíx]k‚àí. The fully dissociated anion (k = n‚àí2x+2) has formula [PnO3n‚àíx+1](n‚àí2x+2)‚àí is The term is also used in organic chemistry for the functional groups that result when or more of the hydrogens are replaced by bonds to other groups. These acids, together with their salts and esters, include some of the best-known compounds of phosphorus, of high importance in biochemistry, mineralogy, agriculture, pharmacy, chemical industry, and chemical research. Acids =Orthophosphoric acid= The simplest and most commonly encountered of the phosphoric acids is orthophosphoric acid, H3PO4. Indeed, the term phosphoric acid often means this compound specifically (and this is also the current IUPAC nomenclature). =Oligophosphoric and polyphosphoric acids= Polyphosphoric acid Two or more orthophosphoric acid molecules can be joined by condensation into larger molecules by elimination of water. Condensation of a few units yields the oligophosphoric acids, while larger molecules are called polyphosphoric acids. (However, the distinction between the two terms is not well defined.) For example, pyrophosphoric, triphosphoric and tetraphosphoric acids can be obtained by the reactions : 2 ‚Üí + : + ‚Üí + : + ‚Üí + The \\"backbone\\" of a polyphosphoric acid molecule is a chain of alternating P and O atoms. Each extra orthophosphoric unit that is condensed adds 1 extra H (hydrogen) atom, 1 extra P (phosphorus) atom, and 3 extra O (oxygen) atoms. The general formula of a polyphosphoric acid is or HO(‚ÄìP(O)(OH)‚ÄìO‚Äì)nH. Polyphosphoric acids are used in organic synthesis for cyclizations and acylations. =Cyclic phosphoric acids= Condensation between two ‚ÄìOH units of the same molecule, on the other hand, eliminates two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, creating a cycle, as in the formation of trimetaphosphoric acid: : ‚Üí + The general formula of a phosphoric acid is Hn‚àí2x+2PnO3n‚àíx+1, where n is the number of phosphorus atoms and x is the number of fundamental cycles in the molecule's structure; that is, the minimum number of bonds that would have to be broken to eliminate all cycles. File:Phosphoric-acid-3D-vdW.pngOrthophosphoric acid H3PO4 File:Pyrophosphoric-acid-3D-vdW.pngPyrophosphoric acid File:Tripolyphosphoric-acid-3D-vdW.pngTripolyphosphoric acid File:Tetrapolyphosphoric-acid-3D-vdW.pngTetrapolyphosphoric acid File:Trimetaphosphoric-acid-3D-vdW.pngTrimetaphosphoric acid H3P3O9 File:Phosphorus-pentoxide-3D-vdW.pngPhosphoric anhydride P4O10 File:Various Phosphoric Acids.PNG The limiting case of internal condensation, where all oxygen atoms are shared and there are no hydrogen atoms (x = (n+2)/2) would be an anhydride PnO5n/2, such as phosphorus pentoxide . Phosphates Removal of the hydrogen atoms as protons turns a phosphoric acid into a phosphate anion. Partial removal yields various hydrogen phosphate anions. =Orthophosphate= The anions of orthophosphoric acid are orthophosphate , hydrogen phosphate , and dihydrogen phosphate =Linear oligophosphates and polyphosphates= Dissociation of pyrophosphoric acid generates four anions, k‚àí, where the charge k ranges from 1 to 4. The last one is pyrophosphate . The pyrophosphates are mostly water-soluble. Likewise, tripolyphosphoric acid yields at least five anions k‚àí, where k ranges from 1 to 5, including tripolyphosphate . Tetrapolyphosphoric acid yields at least six anions, including tetrapolyphosphate , and so on. Note that each extra phosphoric unit adds one extra P atom, three extra oxygen atoms, and either one extra hydrogen atom or an extra negative charge. Branched polyphosphoric acids give similarly branched polyphosphate anions. The simplest example of this is triphosphono phosphate 9‚àí and its partially dissociated versions. The general formula for such (non-cyclic) polyphosphate anions, linear or branched, is k‚àí, where the charge k may vary from 1 to n+2. Generally in an aqueous solution, the degree or percentage of dissociation depends on the pH of the solution. =Cyclic polyphosphates= Trimetaphsphoric acid The phosphoric acid units can be bonded together in rings (cyclic structures) forming metaphosphoric acid molecules. The simplest such compound is trimetaphosphoric acid or cyclo-triphosphoric acid having the formula H3P3O9. Its structure is shown in the illustration. Since the ends are condensed, its formula has one less H2O (water) than tripolyphosphoric acid. What are commonly called trimetaphosphates actually have a mixture of ring sizes. A general formula for such cyclic compounds is (HPO3)x where x = number of phosphoric units in the molecule. The hypothetical monomer monometaphosphoric acid (HPO3), which would be valence isoelectronic with nitric acid, is not known to exist. When these metaphosphoric acids lose their hydrogens as H+, cyclic anions called metaphosphates are formed. An example of a compound with such an anion is sodium hexametaphosphate (Na6P6O18), used as a sequestrant and a food additive. =Chemical properties= Solubility These phosphoric acids series are generally water-soluble considering the polarity of the molecules. Ammonium and alkali phosphates are also quite soluble in water. The alkaline earth salts start becoming less soluble and phosphate salts of various other metals are even less soluble. Hydrolysis and condensation In aqueous solutions (solutions of water), water gradually (over the course of hours) hydrolyzes polyphosphates into smaller phosphates and finally into ortho-phosphate, given enough water. Higher temperature or acidic conditions can speed up the hydrolysis reactions considerably. Conversely, polyphosphoric acids or polyphosphates are often formed by dehydrating a phosphoric acid solution; in other words, removing water from it often by heating and evaporating the water off. =Uses= Ortho-, pyro-, and tripolyphosphate compounds have been commonly used in detergents (i. e. cleaners) formulations. For example, see Sodium tripolyphosphate. Sometimes pyrophosphate, tripolyphosphate, tetrapolyphosphate, etc. are called diphosphate, triphosphate, tetraphosphate, etc., especially when they are part of phosphate esters in biochemistry. They are also used for scale and corrosion control by potable water providers. As a corrosion inhibitor, polyphosphates work by forming a protective film on the interior surface of pipes. Phosphate esters General chemical structure of a monophosphate ester; here any R can be H or some organic radical. The -OH groups in phosphoric acids can also condense with the hydroxyl groups of alcohols to form phosphate esters. Since orthophosphoric acid has three -OH groups, it can esterify with one, two, or three alcohol molecules to form a mono-, di-, or triester. See the general structure image of an ortho- (or mono-) phosphate ester below on the left, where any of the R groups can be a hydrogen or an organic radical. Di- and tripoly- (or tri-) phosphate esters, etc. are also possible. Any -OH groups on the phosphates in these ester molecules may lose H+ ions to form anions, again depending on the pH in a solution. In the biochemistry of living organisms, there are many kinds of (mono)phosphate, diphosphate, and triphosphate compounds (essentially esters), many of which play a significant role in metabolism such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and triphosphate (ATP).

The adult is mainly chestnut brown, with a greyish lower belly, browner tail and white tips to the tail feathers. The bill is yellow, short, and decurved; the iris of the eyes is red. Immature birds are dark brown with a black bill and no white tail tips. It is smaller and the throat is darker than in the squirrel cuckoo. The little cuckoo makes harsh chek and kak calls. Range, habitat and behavior This small cuckoo occurs from Panama and Trinidad south through Colombia to Bolivia, Peru and Brazil; in Ecuador, it has been recorded as high up as ASL. The little cuckoo is found in mangrove swamps, and scrubby woodland near water. It is generally believed to be an all-year resident, but its irregular occurrence in some areas has led to speculations that it undertakes seasonal short-distance migrations. Fairly widely distributed and not particularly rare, it is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN. This is a shy species which tends to keep to cover as it forages in low branches for insects and other arthropods. The female lays two white eggs in a deep cup nest in a tree or bamboo. Like most American cuckoos, it incubates the eggs itself.

The term \\"Apostolic\\" represents the denomination's belief that church government is to be exercised through the New Testament ministry of apostles (working in conjunction with New Testament prophets) in order to experience the same kind of leadership as that exercised by the original apostles who followed Christ. Gaining world-wide attention in the 1904‚Äì1905 Welsh Revival, it seeks to stand for first-century Christianity in its faith, practices, and government. History The Apostolic Temple, Pen-y-groes The Apostolic Church School of Ministry, Pen-y-groes In 1911, William Oliver Hutchinson founded the Apostolic Faith Church denomination, in Bournemouth, England. Allan Anderson, An Introduction to Pentecostalism: Global Charismatic Christianity, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2013, p. 101 On 8 January 1916, Daniel Powell Williams and a number of the Welsh assemblies separated from Hutchinson and the Apostolic Faith Church over doctrinal matters, creating the Apostolic Church in Wales (ACW). William Kay, Anne Dyer, \\"European Pentecostalism\\", BRILL, Royaume-Uni, 2011, p. 44 Since 1916, the two groups have developed along very different doctrinal paths. In 1917 a second group centred on Birmingham affiliated to the ACW. The following year the Burning Bush Pentecostal Congregation in Glasgow, came into co-operation with the ACW but remained independent. In the same year, a group using the name \\"Apostolic Church\\" in Hereford also came into co-operation with the ACW. In 1920, Ben Fisher, who was the leader of an independent Pentecostal congregation in Belfast, Northern Ireland, invited Williams to minister in his church. The group then affiliated to the ACW becoming their first mission field. H V Chanter was the leader of the Apostolic Church of God (ACG); a large group of Pentecostal congregations headquartered in Bradford. During 1921, Chanter attended the Christmas convention of the ACW in Pen-y-groes, Carmarthenshire. A given in Bradford directed the leaders to invite the Welsh leaders to join them for a meeting. They met 1922, with another wider meeting arranged for Easter. At the Easter convention, leaders from most of the ACW congregations and those affiliated with them met in Bradford. The 1922 Easter meeting in Bradford was the beginning of the Apostolic Church. Four main groups attended: the Apostolic Church in Wales; the Burning Bush congregation; the Apostolic Church in Hereford; and the Apostolic Church of God. A directed them to form an administrative union: Pen-y-groes was to be the administrative centre; Glasgow, the financial centre; and Bradford the missionary centre. In 2016, the denomination had 15 million members in 90 countries. Marcus Jones, Apostolic Church celebrates 100th anniversary, premier.org.uk, UK, July 30, 2016 Theology The Apostolic Church views the Scriptures as the supreme authority and understands them to be the inerrant Word of God. The soteriology of the Apostolic Church is neither uniformly Reformed nor Arminian. Ecclesiology has taken a prominent place in the theology of the movement. The Church is defined as the Body of Christ and the headship of Christ is given prominence. Christ is seen to express his headship through the of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers. Its theological beliefs are summarized in its confession of faith, known as the Tenets, which read as follows:Constitution of the Apostolic Church, p.8The Holy Bible # Jesus is God the Father in creation (Genesis 1:1), He is the Son in redemption (John 14:18), and the Holy Ghost in re-generation (Acts 2:38). (Deut.6:4; Isa.41:4, 42:8, 43:11, 44:6, 45:5, 46:9, 47:10, 48:12; Col.1:13-19, 2:9; James 2:19). # The utter depravity of human nature, the necessity for repentance and regeneration and the eternal doom of the finally impenitent. # The virgin birth, sinless life, atoning death, triumphant resurrection, ascension, abiding intercession of our Lord Jesus Christ and His second coming. # Justification and Sanctification of the believer through the finished work of Christ by receiving the Baptism of the Holy Ghost by the evidence of speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives the utterance(ability). # The baptism of the Holy Ghost for believers, with signs following. # The nine gifts of the Holy Ghost for the edification, exhortation and comfort of the Church, which is the body of Christ. # The sacraments of baptism by immersion in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission (washing away) of sins, and of the Lord‚Äôs Supper. # The Divine inspiration and authority of the Holy Scriptures. # Church government by apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers, elders and deacons. # The security of the believer as he remains in Christ (not to be mistaken as the false once saved always saved doctrine). # The privilege of paying tithes and offerings. The Constitution of the Apostolic Church in the United Kingdom states that \\"These Tenets shall forever be the doctrinal standard of the Apostolic Church and shall not be subject to change in any way whatsoever.\\"Constitution of the Apostolic Church, p.8 Annual conference Ablaze UK (formerly The International Apostolic Convention) has taken place annually over the first week in August since 1916. Until 2002 it was held in Pen-y-groes, Carmarthenshire. From 2003 to 2011 it was held in Swansea, and from 2012 the convention has taken place in Cheltenham. Colleges Pen-y- groes is the site of the Apostolic Church School of Ministry (founded as the Apostolic Church International Bible School in 1933), the oldest Pentecostal college in Great Britain. The College is currently closed and the facilities are now being used by a Korean Church as a Bible College. It has also been used as a rehab centre for Teen Challenge. There are now also Bible Schools in eleven other countries. Hymnal In the past the standard hymnal of the Apostolic Church has been the Redemption Hymnal, which was produced by a joint committee from the Apostolic Church, the Elim Pentecostal Church, and the Assemblies of God in Great Britain and Ireland. Molwch Dduw was the hymnal used in Welsh language Apostolic assemblies and contained many hymns by D.P. Williams and other early Apostolic figures. Another hymnal, Hymns at the Holy Table, was produced by Ian MacPherson for use in the Apostolic Church and other British Pentecostal assemblies at the Breaking of Bread. Chorus books, such as Gospel Quintet Choruses, Gates of Praise, and Glorious Vision Melodies, were also frequently published during the course of the 20th Century.

Development  One of the first attempts to implement such a political system was perhaps Pythagoras' \\"city of the wise\\" that he planned to build in Italy together with his followers, the order of \\"mathematikoi\\". In modern history, similar concepts were introduced by Vladimir Vernadsky, who did not use this term, but the term \\"noosphere\\". As defined by Plato, noocracy is considered to be the future political system for the entire human race, replacing democracy (\\"the authority of the crowd\\") and other forms of government. Mikhail Epstein defined noocracy as \\"the thinking matter increases its mass in nature and geo- and biosphere grow into noosphere, the future of the humanity can be envisioned as noocracy‚Äîthat is the power of the collective brain rather than separate individuals representing certain social groups or society as whole\\".  Rationales for noocracy  = Irrationality of voters = Supporters of the noocratic theory mainly depart from the empirical evidence that most voters in modern democracies are largely ignorant, misinformed and irrational. Therefore, one person one vote mechanism proposed by democracy cannot be used to produce efficient policy outcomes, for which the transfer of power to a smaller, informed and rational group would be more appropriate. The irrationality of voters inherent in democracies can be explained by two major behavioral and cognitive patterns. Firstly, most of the voters think that the marginal contribution of their vote will not make a difference on election outcomes; therefore, they do not find it useful to inform themselves on political matters. In other terms, due to the required time and effort of acquiring new information, voters rationally prefer to remain ignorant. Moreover, it has been shown that most citizens process political information in deeply biased, partisan, motivated ways rather than in dispassionate, rational ways. This psychological phenomenon causes voters to strongly identify themselves with a certain political group, specifically find evidence to support arguments aligning with their preferred ideological inclinations, and eventually vote with a high level of bias. = Democracy's susceptibility for bad policies = Irrational political behaviors of voters prevent them from making calculated choices and opting for the right policy proposals. On the other hand, many political experiments have shown that as voters get more informed, they tend to support better policies, demonstrating that acquisition of information has a direct impact on rational voting. For example, Martin Gilens notes in his research that low-income democrats tend to have more intolerant thoughts pertinent to LGBT rights, whereas high-income democrats have the opposite preferences. Moreover, supporters of noocracy see a greater danger in the fact that politicians will actually prefer to implement the policy decisions of citizens to win elections and stabilize their power, without paying particular attention to the content and further outcomes of these policies. In democracies, the problem is thus not only that voters are prone to make bad policy decisions, but also that politicians are incentivized to implement these policies due to personal benefits. Therefore, noocrats argue that it makes sense to limit the voting power of citizens in order to prevent bad policy outcomes. Noocracy has still a code of conduct to pursue philanthropy like initiatives. = Use of expertise for efficient outcomes = According to noocrats, given the complex nature of political decisions, it is not reasonable to assume that a citizen would have the necessary knowledge to decide on means to achieve their political aims. In general, political actions require a lot of social scientific knowledge from various fields, such as economics, sociology, international relations, and public policy; however, an ordinary voter is hardly specialized enough in any of those fields to make the optimal decision. To address this issue, Christiano proposes a ruling system based on division of political labor, in which citizens set the agenda for political discussions and determine the aims of the society, whereas legislators are in charge of deciding on the means to achieve these aims. For noocrats, transferring the decision-making mechanism to a body of specifically trained, specialized and experienced body is expected to result in superior and more efficient policy outcomes. Recent economic success of some countries that have a sort of noocratic ruling element provides basis for this particular argument in favor of noocracy. For instance, Singapore has a political system that favors meritocracy; the path to government in Singapore is structured in such a way that only those with above-average skills are identified with strict university-entrance exams, recruiting processes, etc., and then rigorously trained to be able to devise best the solutions that benefit the entire society. In the words of country‚Äôs founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore is a society based on effort and merit, not wealth or privilege depending on birth. This system primarily works due to citizens‚Äô belief that political leaders tend to have a better understanding of country‚Äôs long-term plans than themselves; therefore, as they see positive policy outcomes, they tend to go along with the system, rather than complain about the meritocratic dimensions. For example, most citizens praise their government in Singapore, stating that it managed to transform Singapore from a third world country to a developed economy, and that it successfully fostered loyalty in its citizens towards the country and gave birth to a unique concept of Singaporean citizenship despite a great level of ethnic diversity. In order to develop further Singapore‚Äôs technocratic system, some thinkers, like Parag Khanna, have proposed for the country to adapt a model of direct technocracy, demanding citizen input in essential matters through online polls, referenda, etc., and asking for a committee of experts to analyze this data to determine the best course of action. Criticisms Noocracies, like technocracies, have been criticized for meritocratic failings, such as upholding of a non-egalitarian aristocratic ruling class. Others have upheld more democratic ideals as better epistemic models of law and policy. Noocracy criticisms come in multiple forms, two of which are those focused on the efficacy of noocracies and the political viability of them. Criticisms of noocracy in all its forms ‚Äì including technocracy, meritocracy, and epistocracy (the focus of Jason Brennan's oft-cited book) ‚Äì range from support of direct democracy instead to proposed alterations to our consideration of representation in democracy. Professor H√©l√®ne Landemore, while arguing for representatives to effectively enact legislation important to the polity, criticizes conceptions of representation that aim especially to remove the people from the process of making decisions, and thereby nullify their political power. Noocracy, especially as it is conceived in Jason Brennan's Against Democracy, aims specifically to separate the people from the decision on the basis of the immensely superior knowledge of officials who will presumably make superior decisions to laypeople. = Noocracy as anti- democratic = Jason Brennan's epistocracy, specifically, is at odds with democracy and with certain criteria for democracies that theorists have proposed. Robert Dahl's Polyarchy sets out certain rules for democracies that govern many people and the rights that the citizens must be granted. His demand that the government not discriminatorily heed the preferences of full members of the polity is abridged by Brennan's \\"restricted suffrage\\" and \\"plural voting\\" schemes of epistocracy. In the eighth chapter of his book, Brennan posits a system of graduated voting power that gives people more votes based on established levels of education achieved, with the amount of additional votes granted to a hypothetical citizen increasing at each level, from turning sixteen to completing high school, a bachelor's degree, a master's degree, and so forth. Dahl wrote, however, that any democracy that rules over a large group of people must accept and validate \\"alternative sources of information.\\" Granting the full powers of citizenship based on a system like formal education attainment does not account for the other ways that people can consume information, is the commonly cited argument, and still eschews consideration for the uneducated within a group. = Inefficiency of experts = Noocracy also receives criticism for its claims to efficiency. Brennan writes that one of the many reasons that common people cannot be trusted to make decisions for the state is because reasoning is commonly motivated, and, therefore, people decide what policies to support based on their connection to those proposing and supporting the measures, not based on what's most effective. He contrasts real people with the ultra-reasonable vulcan that he mentions throughout the book. That vulcan reflects Plato's philosopher king and, in a more realistic sense, the academic elites whom Michael Yong satirized in his essay The Rise of the Meritocracy. Modern political theorists don't necessarily denounce a biased viewpoint in politics, however, though those biases are not written about as they are commonly considered. Professor Landemore utilizes the existence of cognitive diversity to argue that any group of people that represents great diversity in their approaches to problem-solving (cognition) is more likely to succeed than groups that do not. She further illustrates her point by employing the example of a New Haven task force made up of private citizens of many careers, politicians, and police who needed to reduce crime on a bridge without lighting, and they all used different aspects of their experiences to discover the solution that was to install solar lamps on the bridge. That solution has proven effective, with not a single mugging reported there since the lamp installation as of November 2010. Her argument lies mainly in the refutation of noocratic principles, for they do not utilize the increased problem solving skill of a diverse pool, when the political system because as debate between elites alone, and not a debate between the whole polity. To some theorists, noocracy is built on a fantasy that will uphold current structures of elite power, while maintaining its inefficacy. Writing for the New Yorker, Caleb Crain notes that there's little to say that the vulcans that Brennan exalts actually exist. Crain mentions a study that appears in Brennan's book that shows that even those who have proven that they have superb skills in mathematics do not employ those skills if their use threatens their already- held political belief. While Brennan utilized that study to demonstrate how deeply rooted political tribalism is in all people, Crain drew on this study to question the very nature of an epistocratic body that can make policy with a greater regard to knowledge and truth than the ordinary citizen can. The only way to correct for that seems, to many, to be to widen the circle of deliberation (as discussed above) because policy decisions that were made with more input and approval from the people last longer and even garner the agreement of the experts. To further illustrate that experts, too, are flawed, Cairn enumerates some of the expert-endorsed political decisions that he has deemed failures in recent years: \\"invading Iraq, having a single European currency, grinding subprime mortgages into the sausage known as collateralized debt obligations.\\" With the contention around the reasoning for those political decisions, political theorist David Estlund posited what he considered to be one of the prime arguments against epistocracy ‚Äì bias in choosing voters. His fear was that the method by which voters, and voters' quantity of votes, was chosen might be biased in a way that people had not been able to identify and could not, therefore, rectify. Even the aspects of the modes of selecting voters that are known cause many theorists concern, as both Brennan and Cairn note that the majority of poor black women would be excluded from the enfranchised polity and risk seeing their needs represented even less than they currently are. = Rejection of demographic unjustness of noocracy = Proponents of democracy attempt to show that noocracy is intrinsically unjust on two dimensions, stating its unfairness and bad results. The former states that since people with different income levels and education backgrounds have unequal access to information, the epistocratic legislative body will be naturally composed of citizens with higher economic status, and thus fail to equally represent different demographics of the society. The latter argument is about the policy outcomes; since there will be a demographic overrepresentation and underrepresentation in the noocratic body, the system will produce unjust outcomes, favoring the demographically advantaged group. Brennan defends noocracy against these two criticisms, presenting a rationale for the system. As a rejection of the unfairness argument put forward by democrats, Brennan argues that the voting electorate in modern democracies is also demographically disproportionate; based on empirical studies, it has been demonstrated that voters coming from privileged background, such as white, middle aged, higher-income men, tend to vote at a higher rate than other demographic groups. Although de jure every group has same right to vote under one person one vote assumption, de facto practices show that privileged people have more influence on election results. As a result, the representatives will not match the demographics of the society either, for which democracy seems to be unjust in practice. With the right of type of noocracy, the unfairness effect can actually be minimized; for instance, enfranchisement lottery, in which a legislative electorate is selected at random by lottery, and then incentivized to become competent to address political issues, illustrates a fair representation methodology thanks to its randomness. To refute the latter claim, Brennan states that voters do not vote selfishly; in other terms, the advantaged group does not attempt to undermine the interests of the minority group. Therefore, the worry that noocratic bodies that are demographically more skewed towards the advantaged group make decisions in favor of the advantaged one fails. According to Brennan, noocracy can serve in a way that improves the welfare of the overall community, rather than certain individuals.

The school was formerly called Park High Grade School and as a result old boys are referred to as Old Parkonians. ICHS is a six-form entry school, each form comprising up to 30 pupils. Originally one of a number of selective schools in the London Borough of Redbridge, ICHS was retained in 1973 as the only boys‚Äô selective school in the borough. Admission at 11+ takes place through tests administered by the borough as local education authority. There is also opportunity for admission at 16+, directly into the sixth form, but the majority of places each year are taken up by existing students of the lower school.  History  The school was founded in 1901 in Balfour Road, Ilford as Park Higher Grade School, before moving to its present site on Fremantle Road, Barkingside in 1935. The ground floor of the original building in Balfour Road is today used as an annexe for the adjoining Christchurch Primary School, and the remainder of the building as Redbridge Teachers' Centre. Although there once existed several selective grammar schools in the area, by 1973 it remained the only boys' selective school in Redbridge. The girls' section split off in 1929 to a new site in Cranbrook Road, where the school was known as Ilford County High School for Girls. Following the conversion of the girls' school to being part of a co-educational school (Valentines High School), Woodford County High School (WCHS) is now seen as the \\"sister school\\". In recent times, it has become the \\"partner school\\" of Trinity Catholic High School and Ilford Jewish Primary School. In 2004/5, there were 843 pupils, including 245 in the sixth form, and 88 members of staff, including 63 teachers. The Headmaster, from 1993, was Mr S I Devereux who retired in December 2009. From January 2010 to 18 April 2010 Mrs Carole Jordan (Deputy Head) became Acting Head Teacher. On 19 April 2010, Mr Michael Capon officially became the new Headmaster of Ilford County High School. He was previously Deputy Headteacher of St Martins School, Brentwood. Mr Capon retired from the school in July 2014 after four years of service to the school. He was succeeded by Mrs Rebecca Drysdale as Acting Head Teacher at first, while her position of Deputy Head was accepted on an acting basis by Mrs Foucher and Mr Streatfield. Mrs Drysdale is the second female acting head teacher in Ilford County High School's history. On 28 April 2015 Mrs Drysdale's appointment to the post was confirmed by the governors as substantive. Mrs Foucher and Mr Streatfield were appointed substantive Deputy Headteachers following interviews held on 12 June 2015. =Old Parkonians= The Old Parkonians Association was founded as an association of former pupils of the Ilford County High School. Today, the association performs a dual role, as \\"landlord\\" of the facilities at the Oakfield Playing Fields and parent body for the affiliated Sports Clubs, and as a social hub for former pupils of the School. The association has two affiliated sports clubs; the Old Parkonians Football Club & the Oakfield Parkonians Cricket Club. Old Parkonians FC currently has nine senior teams, all of which compete in the Southern Amateur League. In the 2011/12 season OPFC became the first club to simultaneously hold the Senior (1st XI), Junior (2nd XI) and Minor (3rd XI) Old Boys cups. In Summer 2014 the football club created a youth section called the Young Parkonians Football Club. There are currently Under 13's and Under 16's teams competing in the Echo Junior Football League with plans to add more youth teams in future years. The Cricket Club, now open to all, still retains strong links with the School, providing coaching during the winter and playing the annual Centenary Trophy match against the School 1st XI each year. The Cricket Club fields 5 XIs in the Shepherd Neame Essex League, an occasional 6th XI on Saturdays, and teams playing friendlies on Sundays, as well as running a Colts section. School magazine =Chronicles= The school has published a magazine since its foundation entitled \\"Chronicles\\", often showcasing students' poems and artwork, in addition to news. Prior to 2007, Chronicles had always been published in book format and distributed to students throughout the school. However, this was discontinued in 2007, and was replaced by an online-only version. =Focus= \\"Focus\\" is a school newspaper written by a group of lower school pupils. The first edition was released in 2010 and all editions are available to view on the school website. The newspaper discusses on-going school issues and other topics of interest to pupils. = STEM = \\"STEM\\" was a termly periodical, formed and edited by a team of sixth form students which published articles on science-orientated subjects. The periodical was distributed during the 2015 academic year and remains available to view on the school website  New facilities  Side view of the new Sports Hall Construction of a new Sports Hall was completed in November 2006 and was opened by former pupil Sir Trevor Brooking. The Sports Hall provides access to gym equipment, a swimming pool and a large sports hall. The Learning Resource Centre (Library) also came into action in October. In 2014, the Sixth Form Suite was constructed, purpose made for KS5 students to use as a learning environment outside of the LRC which is used by all years. The block is constructed in the location of the old Economics and Business class, which has since been housed elsewhere in the school. The Sixth Form Suite also houses the offices for the Head of Sixth Form & Deputy Heads of Sixth Form. On 1 June 2015 work was started to refurbish the canteen, and the canteen was ready for use for the students by the start of new school year. In August 2015 on the construction of a new science and technology block, with additional sixth form facilities, preparatory to expansion of the main school to six forms of entry commencing with the Year 7 intake in September 2016. Work initially got delayed due to planning permission going through with the sister school, Woodford County High School. In September 2015, construction commenced for the expansion of the school, while the school maintained normal functionality. The new building was finally available to students September 2017, and has been in use ever since.

Normally written as COS as a chemical formula that does not imply its structure, it is a colourless flammable gas with an unpleasant odor. It is a linear molecule consisting of a carbonyl group double bonded to a sulfur atom. Carbonyl sulfide can be considered to be intermediate between carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide, both of which are valence isoelectronic with it. Carbonyl sulfide decomposes in the presence of humidity and bases to carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. This compound is found to catalyze the formation of peptides from amino acids. This finding is an extension of the Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment and it is suggested that carbonyl sulfide played a significant role in the origin of life.  Occurrence  Carbonyl sulfide is the most abundant sulfur compound naturally present in the atmosphere, at , because it is emitted from oceans, volcanoes and deep sea vents. As such, it is a significant compound in the global sulfur cycle. Measurements on the Antarctica ice cores and from air trapped in snow above glaciers (firn air) have provided a detailed picture of OCS concentrations from 1640 to the present day and allow an understanding of the relative importance of anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic sources of this gas to the atmosphere. Some carbonyl sulfide that is transported into the stratospheric sulfate layer is oxidized to sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid forms particulate which affects energy balance due to light scattering. The long atmospheric lifetime of COS makes it the major source of stratospheric sulfate, though sulfur dioxide from volcanic activity can be significant too. Carbonyl sulfide is also removed from the atmosphere by terrestrial vegetation by enzymes associated with the uptake of carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, and by hydrolysis in ocean waters. Loss processes, such as these, limit the persistence (or lifetime) of a molecule of COS in the atmosphere to a few years. The largest man-made sources of carbonyl sulfide release include its primary use as a chemical intermediate and as a byproduct of carbon disulfide production; however, it is also released from automobiles and their tire wear, coal-fired power plants, coking ovens, biomass combustion, fish processing, combustion of refuse and plastics, petroleum manufacture, and manufacture of synthetic fibers, starch, and rubber. The average total worldwide release of carbonyl sulfide to the atmosphere has been estimated at about 3 million tons/year, of which less than one third was related to human activity. It is also a significant sulfur- containing impurity in synthesis gas. Carbonyl sulfide is present in foodstuffs, such as cheese and prepared vegetables of the cabbage family. Traces of COS are naturally present in grains and seeds in the range of 0.05‚Äì0.1 mg¬∑kg‚àí1. Carbonyl sulfide has been observed in the interstellar medium (see also List of molecules in interstellar space), in comet 67P and in the atmosphere of Venus, where, because of the difficulty of producing COS inorganically, it is considered a possible indicator of life.  Applications  Carbonyl sulfide is used as an intermediate in the production of thiocarbamate herbicides. Carbonyl sulfide is a potential alternative fumigant to methyl bromide and phosphine. In some cases, however, residues on the grain result in flavours that are unacceptable to consumers, e.g. barley used for brewing. Carbonyl sulfide is readily converted to the gaseous signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide by carbonic anhydrase enzymes in plants and mammals. Because of this chemistry, the release of carbonyl sulfide from small organic molecules has been identified as a strategy for delivering hydrogen sulfide in different biological contexts. In ecosystem science, carbonyl sulfide is increasingly often being used to describe the rate of the photosynthesis.  Synthesis  Carbonyl sulfide was first described in 1841, but was apparently mischaracterized as a mixture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Carl von Than first characterized the substance in 1867. It forms when carbon monoxide reacts with molten sulfur. This reaction reverses above . A laboratory synthesis entails the reaction potassium thiocyanate and sulfuric acid. The resulting gas contains significant amounts of byproducts and requires purification. : KSCN + 2 + ‚Üí + + COS Hydrolysis of isothiocyanates in hydrochloric acid solution also affords COS.  Toxicity  As of 1994, limited information existed on the acute toxicity of carbonyl sulfide in humans and in animals. High concentrations (>1000 ppm) can cause sudden collapse, convulsions, and death from respiratory paralysis. Occasional fatalities have been reported, practically without local irritation or olfactory warning. In tests with rats, 50% animals died when exposed to of COS for 90 minutes, or at for 9 minutes. Limited studies with laboratory animals also suggest that continued inhalation of low concentrations (~50 ppm for up to 12 weeks) does not affect the lungs or the heart.

It was published in hardcover on May 11, 2004 and in paperback on April 6, 2006. In 2006 the audiobook adaptation of The Truth About Forever was one of the Young Adult Library Services Association's selected picks for that year.YALSA's 2006 Selected Videos/DVDs & Audiobooks for Young Adults School Library Journal Plot summary Macy is still recovering from the sudden loss of her father. Since he died during one of their habitual morning runs, Macy gives up running and keeps all of her feelings to herself. This results in her being unable to comfort her mother. Her boyfriend, Jason, is currently away at Brain Camp. When Macy attempts to communicate with him about her unhappiness with her coworkers at the library. At the end of one of their e-mails she tells him that she loves him, he replies and thinks it would be for the best if they took a break until he returns in August. Upset and hurt, Macy goes for a ride and sees a van for Wish Catering, which catered her mother's party. She applies for a job, which she gets. Macy enjoys this new job and her new coworkers. There she meets the artistic Wes, who she later discovers lost his mother to cancer and attended reform school for breaking and entering. During this time Macy's older sister begins to renovate their father's beach house despite reluctance from the other family members (mainly from her mother). Her mother refuses to talk to Macy about the sudden death of her husband, Macy's father; therefore she proceeds to put all of her time into her work. Macy attends a party with some of her coworkers, where a drunk, former friend from the track team reveals to Macy's friends Wes, Kristy, Bert, and Monica that she had to witness her father's death. Ignoring this information, everybody returns to the party. There, she bonds with coworker Kristy, who advises her to enjoy her life because forever keeps changing. Later Wes and Macy end up stranded together after their catering van runs out of gas, where Macy opens up to Wes about all of the issues in her life during a game of \\"Truth\\". They continue to play the game later during work, where Macy discovers that he is also in an \\"on break\\" relationship with a girl named Becky. As Macy and Wes grow closer together, Macy's mother advises against the job and any possible relationship with Wes after Macy misses one of her mother's parties due to the birth of Avery, Delia's daughter. Macy later ends up deciding to confess to Wes that she cares about him, but sees him with Becky (Wes's girlfriend) and ends up heart-broken again. Her mother has Macy helping her with preparations for a party, but eventually has to have Wish Catering assist her. It is during this time that Macy succeeds in being able to comfort her mother. Macy realizes that there's more to life than just sticking to the rules and trying to please everyone around her. She realizes that she's the only one in control of her future.

Routers on the Internet normally have packet queues, to allow them to hold packets when the network is busy, rather than discarding them. Because routers have limited resources, the size of these queues is also limited. The simplest technique to limit queue size is known as tail drop. The queue is allowed to fill to its maximum size, and then any new packets are simply discarded, until there is space in the queue again. This causes problems when used on TCP/IP routers handling multiple TCP streams, especially when bursty traffic is present. While the network is stable, the queue is constantly full, and there are no problems except that the full queue results in high latency. However, the introduction of a sudden burst of traffic may cause large numbers of established, steady streams to lose packets simultaneously. TCP has automatic recovery from dropped packets, which it interprets as congestion on the network (which is usually correct). The sender reduces its sending rate for a certain amount of time, and then tries to find out if the network is no longer congested by increasing the rate again subject to a ramp-up. This is known as the slow-start algorithm. Almost all the senders will use the same time delay before increasing their rates. When these delays expire, at the same time, all the senders will send additional packets, the router queue will again overflow, more packets will be dropped, the senders will all back off for a fixed delay... ad infinitum; compare with the thundering herd problem. This pattern of each sender decreasing and increasing transmission rates at the same time as other senders is referred to as \\"global synchronization\\" and leads to inefficient use of bandwidth, due to the large numbers of dropped packets, which must be retransmitted, and because the senders have a reduced sending rate, compared to the stable state, while they are backed-off, following each loss. This problem has been the subject of much research. The consensus appears to be that the tail drop algorithm is the leading cause of the problem, and other queue size management algorithms such as Random Early Detection (RED) and Weighted RED will reduce the likelihood of global synchronization, as well as keeping queue sizes down in the face of heavy load and bursty traffic.

He was the Chief Secretary of Hong Kong from 1985 to 1987, and was briefly Acting Governor of Hong Kong.  Biography  Born David Akers Jones ('Akers' being adopted as part of his surname later), he was son of Walter George Jones, manager of a brick and tile factory at Worthing, West Sussex, and Dorothy (n√©e Akers), a schoolteacher.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2019/11/07/sir-david- akers-jones-hong-kong-chief-secretary-acting-governorBurke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage 107th edition, vol. 1, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 2003, p. 61 He was educated at Worthing High School and Brasenose College, Oxford (MA).Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage 107th edition, vol. 1, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 2003, p. 61 Akers-Jones arrived in Hong Kong in 1957, after serving three years in the Malayan Civil Service and joined the Hong Kong Government in the summer of 1957. During his long career, Akers-Jones served in many important posts in the Government of Hong Kong, including Principal Assistant Colonial Secretary, Secretary for the New Territories, which was later retitled \\"The Secretary for City and New Territories Administration\\". He was instrumental in turning small villages into \\"new towns\\" in the New Territories teeming with factories and apartment blocks to resettle slum- dwellers from the hillsides of Hong Kong Island. He was also Secretary for District Administration, Secretary for Home Affairs and Chief Secretary. After the sudden death of Sir Edward Youde, Akers-Jones became Acting Governor of Hong Kong from December 1986 to April 1987. After retiring from the post of Chief Secretary in 1987, he became Special Assistant to Governor Lord Wilson of Tillyorn for six months. He was later Chairman of the Hong Kong Housing Authority, from 1987 to 1992. In the years leading up to the transfer of sovereignty from the UK to the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1997, Akers-Jones was appointed as a Hong Kong Affairs Advisor to the Central Government of the PRC, from 1992 to 1997, after he relinquished chairmanship of the Hong Kong Housing Authority, having served a five-year term. Sir David Akers-Jones retired and lived quietly in Hong Kong. He and his wife bought the dilapidated secluded villa \\"Dragon View\\", in Sham Tseng, for HK$1.5 million. The couple renovated it and worked extensively on the garden. They were served with a compulsory purchase order on 19 October 2000 when it was decided to go ahead with a road widening project. He is thought to have obtained at least $30 million in compensation.  Discovery Bay controversy  In 2005, Akers- Jones briefly emerged from retirement to defend, before Hong Kong's Legislative Council, his role in zoning the Discovery Bay resort project on Lantau in the 1970s. Developers were allowed to build there with the stipulation that it would become a resort but most of the units were later converted into luxury housing. He was involved in the original zoning decision enabling development, as the then Secretary for the New Territories. With Hong Kong Disneyland subsequently opening nearby and property prices having skyrocketed as a result, suspicions about the fact that the original zoning plan was never enforced have again come to the fore. Akers-Jones criticised the decision to call on an elderly man to testify about events 30 years earlier. He revealed that colonial officials had abruptly changed the zoning of the Discovery Bay project, and gave it to new developers because they feared it would fall into the hands of the former Soviet Union.  Political views  Akers-Jones criticised Hong Kong's post-colonial government for continuing a policy of maintaining high property prices, its lack of urban planning, and frequently ill-conceived plans to reclaim land in Victoria Harbour. Akers-Jones advocated converting the Election Committee into a committee which would nominate suitable candidates for the post of chief executive for election by the public. He further believed in preserving functional constituencies but that they should be turned into an upper house in a bicameral legislature instead of abolishing them.  Memoirs  In later life, Akers-Jones penned occasional letters to the South China Morning Post and wrote occasional columns there and at The Standard. In 2004, he published a volume of reminiscences, entitled Feeling the Stones.  Benevolent work  Akers-Jones was honorary chairman of the Bridge to China foundation, or Wu Zhi Qiao, which is a charitable, non-profit organisation based in Hong Kong dedicated to building footbridges in rural mainland China. It was established in 2005 as a collaborative effort between the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and Xi'an Jiaotong University to build a single footbridge across the Po River in Gansu province. The foundation ultimately formed partnerships with 17 universities in China, Hong Kong, and the United States. He was a vice-president of the Hong Kong Girl Guides Association. He was a founder and the honorary president of the local chapter of Outward Bound. He was vice-patron and honorary life president of the Hong Kong Football Association. Akers-Jones was a trustee and vice-president of the Worldwide Fund for Nature Hong Kong and chairman of the Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation Akers-Jones was chairman of Operation Smile China Medical Mission and president of the English-Speaking Union (Hong Kong). He was honorary advisor to Musicus Society. In 2014, Akers-Jones founded Invotech, a do-tank to spread innovation and technology in Hong Kong.https://www.invotech.org.hk/our-story Personal life In 1951, Akers- Jones married Jane, daughter of Royal Navy Captain Sir Frank Todd Spickernell, KBE, CB, CVO, DSO, and maternal granddaughter of Sir Delves Louis Broughton, 10th Baronet. Jane Akers-Jones was appointed MBE in 1988. They had a son and a daughter.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage 107th edition, vol. 1, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 2003, p. 533 Death Akers-Jones died from colorectal cancer at Queen Elizabeth Hospital on 30 September 2019 at age 92.

He is most known for being the lead guitarist for the metal band Sepultura. He has been featured on every Sepultura release since their second album, Schizophrenia. Additionally, Kisser has also been involved in other bands such as the rock supergroup Hail!, Sexoturica and, more recently, De La Tierra. Biography Kisser was born in S√£o Bernardo do Campo, a municipality in S√£o Paulo to a Slovene mother, from Maribor, Slovenia, and a German father. His father was a mechanical engineer and his mother was a teacher and amateur artist. At an early age, Kisser showed an interest in music. He was 10 when he started to listen to his parents' records of the Beatles, Roberto Carlos and Tonico & Tinoco. He received his first acoustic guitar from his grandmother and later won a second guitar at a game of Bingo. In his early adolescence, Kisser started to play acoustic guitar first learning basic chords from the Brazilian popular music repertoire and later on classical pieces. A friend then introduced Kisser to hard rock with bands like Queen and Kiss which had a great influence on him. In 1983, he went to see Kiss live in S√£o Paulo and his father took him to Rock In Rio in 1985 to see AC/DC. Kisser eventually got his first electric guitar, a Giannini- Supersonic, and an overdrive pedal. Kisser's first guitar was purchased for him by his mother. Some of his major influences consisted then of Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Steve Howe, Tony Iommi, Ritchie Blackmore, Jimmy Page and Randy Rhoads. Career Kisser started performing in 1984 in a three- piece band called Esfinge, which he formed with school friends and where he played guitar and sang. The band played essentially covers of heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, Iron Maiden, Venom and Metallica. Two years later the band renamed itself Pestilence and, in 1987, recorded a demo called Slaves of Pain. The songs on the demo were afterwards reused by Sepultura in their albums Schizophrenia and Beneath the Remains. Pestilence was, however, short-lived and ultimately split up. =Sepultura= Andreas Kisser playing with Sepultura during the Maquin√°ria Festival In 1987, Kisser met the members of Sepultura and went to see the band play live while he was on a vacation trip to Belo Horizonte. On the day of the concert he joined the band as an improvised roadie for vocalist/guitarist Max Cavalera. He also jammed with the members during the intermissions. Following the departure of original lead guitarist Jairo Guedes, Kisser auditioned for the position of lead guitarist. The same year he performed with the band for the first time in Caruaru, Pernambuco and recorded the album Schizophrenia. His involvement in Sepultura helped shape the band's evolving sound. Max Cavalera said of him: On Schizophrenia and Beneath the Remains, Kisser co-wrote the lyrics with Max, whereas the whole band wrote the music. For Arise and thereafter Kisser began to write songs of his own. Kisser has also occasionally provided backing vocals both live and on the records. He also fronted the band in 1996, at the Castle Donington Monsters of Rock festival, when Max Cavalera was forced to absent himself in order to attend the funeral of his stepson Dana Wells. =Hail!= Kisser is also a member of the metal tribute band Hail!. That band's rotating cast of members include Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens, Paul Bostaph, David Ellefson, Mike Portnoy, Jimmy DeGrasso, Phil Demmel and Roy Mayorga. Hail! Was formed in the late 2008 by Ellefson and music manager Mark Abbattista. The band's original lineup, which consisted of DeGrasso, Ellefson, Kisser and Owens, started a series of concerts in 2009 in Chile. The band then toured Europe and played an exclusive concert in Lebanon. In 2010, Hail! went on a second European tour and played a number of US shows with the following line-up: Andreas Kisser, Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens, Paul Bostaph and James LoMenzo. =De La Tierra= In December 2012, Kisser formed the Latin American supergroup De La Tierra with Alex Gonz√°lez of Man√°, Andr√©s Gim√©nez of A.N.I.M.A.L. and Sr. Flavio of Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. The band first released a teaser and a number of behind-the-scene footages of the recording before releasing their debut single \\"Maldita Historia\\" in 2013. =Film composition= Kisser worked on three Brazilian movie soundtracks. For No Cora√ß√£o dos Deuses (\\"In the Heart of Gods\\"), a 1999 drama film, he worked on the score with Igor Cavalera and Mike Patton. The soundtrack was recorded at the Estudio ION in S√£o Paulo in June 1998 and produced by Andr√© Moraes. In 2001 Kisser worked alongside Tony Bellotto, Eduardo de Queir√≥s, Charles Gavin on the score of the award-winning crime film Bellini and the Sphynx. Kisser collaborated again on the soundtrack for the 2008 sequel Bellini and the Devil. =Solo work= In August 2009, Kisser released his solo debut album entitled Hubris I & II. When not active with Sepultura Kisser experimented musical ideas, wrote and recorded demo material, some of which had been gestating for 15 years prior to the album's release. In 2007, he uploaded a few short videos of the recording process through his YouTube account. It finally took Kisser 6 years to complete the album during which he handled a great part of the production duties himself. In the months following the release Kisser played a few shows in Brazil to promote the album and took part in a music video shoot for the song \\"Em Busca Do Ouro\\". The album was eventually nominated at the 2010 Latin Grammys in the \\"Best Brazilian Rock Album\\" category. =Guest work and Collaborations= Andreas Kisser at Nova Rock Festival 2014 Kisser worked on various musical projects. Between 1995 and 1996 Kisser recorded a number of demo tracks with Jason Newsted and Tom Hunting under different monikers. For the first project the trio recorded three demo tracks under the name Sexoturica which later became part of the compilation album IR8 vs. Sexoturica. For the second project, called Quarteto da Pinga and which included Robb Flynn, they recorded two tracks and a cover. In 1996 Kisser renewed his collaboration with Newsted on another project called Godswallop which included Carl Coletti on drums and Sofia Ramos on vocals. Furthermore, Kisser has made multiple guest appearances on other bands' albums, providing additional (lead) guitar and/or vocal accompaniment. He has been featured on the album of bands such as Asesino, Astafix, Biohazard, Burning in Hell, Claustrofobia, Korzus, Krusader, Nailbomb, Ratos de Por√£o and The AK Corral. In 2005, Kisser took part in the recording of the Roadrunner United album. He played guitar on the tracks \\"The Enemy\\", \\"Baptized in the Redemption\\", and \\"No Mas Control\\". He also played at the 25th Anniversary Concert. In 2008 Kisser worked on a Brazilian Beatles tribute album √Ålbum Branco, which was recorded at the Bavini Studio in S√£o Paulo. He played guitar on the tracks Piggies and Helter Skelter. Beside his work as musician, Kisser has been involved in projects as producer. In 1992 Kisser co- produced Hammerhead's album Shadow of a Time to Be. In 2004 he recorded three songs for the Brazilian rock band Sayowa which appeared on the band's debut album Treme Terra. The same year he helped produce Necromancia's album Check Mate and provided additional guitar and backing vocal on the album's title track Greed Up To Kill. In 2006 he produced Sayowa's second Album. The album was also co-produced by the band itself and Stanley Soares. =Trivia= In 1992, Kisser unsuccessfully auditioned for the temporary position of rhythm guitarist of Metallica, as a temporary replacement of James Hetfield, who had suffered severe burns on his left hand and arm during a live show in Montreal. Kisser had been recommended to Metallica through Phil Rind of Sacred Reich who was well acquainted with Jason Newsted. In 2008, he took part in the Scorpions Humanity World Tour in Mexico and Brazil as a guest musician, recording the \\"Amaz√¥nia - Live in the Jungle\\" DVD.http://rollingstone.uol.com.br/guia/dvd/scorpions-amazonia-live-in-the- jungle/ In 2011, Kisser replaced Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian for some European tour dates (July 2‚Äì16), including the Big 4 Sonisphere Festival shows in Gothenburg, Sweden as well as Knebworth, UK and Amneville, France, as Ian and his wife Pearl Aday were expecting the birth of their first child. Kisser played a few concerts with Brazilian Beatles cover band Clube Big Beatles in The Cavern Club in Liverpool and, in August 2012, was given his own brick in the Cavern Club's wall of fame. He thus became the first Brazilian to have one, and the first modern metal guitarist to be honoured in that way. Equipment Andreas Kisser playing guitar during the Metamania festival, 2007 =Guitars= Kisser currently uses Fender, Jackson and Seizi guitars. He has been endorsing Fender guitars since 2002 and Seizi guitars since 2011. Seizi guitars is currently in the process of releasing a signature model. Throughout his career Kisser has used a number of guitars from different companies. In 2001/2002 he endorsed the Squier Stagemaster/Showmaster Deluxe V4 neck-through model. When he started with Sepultura he used an Ibanez guitar. Later he acquired a Charvel Model 2 and Jackson Randy Rhoads which he used extensively and continues to use on recordings. In the 1990s Kisser also used and endorsed ESP and Fernandes guitars. His guitars are tuned to D standard and Bb standard. When touring he takes four guitars with him, two for each tuning.

He was the lead guitar player of the heavy metal band Sepultura from 1985 to 1987 and was part of the short lived project Guerrilha alongside Igor and Max Cavalera and S√≠lvio SDN of Mutilator. He also played with The Mist, Overdose, Eminence. He currently plays bass in a Metallica tribute band called Metallica Cover Brazil, and guitar in The Southern Blacklist. Beside being a musician, Guedz designs figurines, runs an atelier and teaches miniature figure painting. He now lives in Belo Horizonte and has two sons, Igor and √ârico Braga.  Biography  Guedz was born in November 25, 1968 in Jo√£o Monlevade, a municipality in the state of Minas Gerais. He got into music at the age of 10, listening to records of Elvis Presley and from there his musical interest lead him to explore hard rock and heavy metal. His musical idols include Serge Gainsbourg, Leonard Cohen, James Hetfield and Lou Reed. Guedz started playing music at the age of 15, inspired by bands like Mot√∂rhead, Slayer, Voivod, Sacrifice, Possessed and Celtic Frost.  Career  =Sepultura= In 1985 Guedz met the Cavalera brothers during a concert in Belo Horizonte. Guedz was then invited to attend a rehearsal session of Sepultura. He got the opportunity to play with the members and ended up joining the band. His recorded output with the band includes the 1985 EP Bestial Devastation and the 1986 first full-length Morbid Visions. When playing with Sepultura he used the alias \\"Tormentor\\" and on occasion, \\"Jairo T.\\"Barcinski & Gomes (1999), page 32.Morbid Visions/Bestial Devastation CD credits. In 1987 Guedz decided to leave Sepultura while the band was already writing music for the album Schizophrenia. He was replaced a week later by Andreas Kisser.Oliveira (1992), page ? In later interviews he cited a number of reasons for his departure, one of which that he was \\"looking for something different\\", musically speaking.Barcinski & Gomes (1999), page 47. To this days Guedz remains on very good terms with the former and current members of Sepultura and regularly joins them on stage to perform one or several songs from Morbid Visions. In 2005 he appeared on Sepultura's live DVD, Live in S√£o Paulo, playing the songs Necromancer and Troops of Doom and in 2012 he joined Cavalera Conspiracy on stage at the Music Hall in Belo Horizonte and performed the song Troops of Doom with the band. =The Mist= In 1989 Guedz joined the thrash metal band The Mist as a substitute for the guitarists Reinaldo \\"Caval√£o\\" Bedran and Roberto \\"Beto\\" Lima. He took part in the recording of the band's second album The Hangman Tree which came out in 1991 and enjoyed a fair amount of success in Brazil. In the same year, the band was offered a record deal from the British record label Music For Nations but turned it down, a decision Guedz later admitted to regret. After the departure of the singer, Vladimir Korg, The Mist carried on as a three piece and recorded in 1993 the EP Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust. In 1995 the band released the album Gottverlassen and embarked on the No Gods Tour where they played a series of headline shows and a number of opening shows for Kreator. In 1997 the remaining members decided to put an end to The Mist. Meanwhile, Guedz was invited by Overdose to fill in for their guitarist S√©rgio Cicohvicz and went on tour with the band in Europe and America, opening for Mercyful Fate. =Eminence= In 1999 Guedz became the bassist for the death groove metal band Eminence which was formed in 1995 by guitarist Alan Wallace Bello. During the 6 years that Guedz stayed in the band they recorded the full-lengths Chaotic System and Humanology and toured extensively in Europe and South- America. In 2006 Eminence announced Guedz' departure citing \\"personal reasons\\" and \\"scheduling conflicts.\\"  Discography  Eminence * 1999 ‚Äì Chaotic System * 2003 ‚Äì Humanology Guerrilha * 1986 ‚Äì Live at Festival da Morte (Demo) * 1986 ‚Äì Guerrilha (Demo) Sepultura * 1985 ‚Äì Bestial Devastation / S√©culo XX (Split) * 1985 ‚Äì Bestial Devastation (EP) * 1986 ‚Äì Rehearsal (Demo) * 1986 ‚Äì Morbid Visions * 1990 ‚Äì The Lost Tapes of Cogumelo (Split) The Mist * 1991 ‚Äì The Hangman Tree * 1993 ‚Äì Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust (EP) * 1995 ‚Äì Gottverlassen  Notes   References  * Barcinski, Andr√© & Gomes, Silvio (1999).

They were preceded by the Junior Cambridge and Preliminary Cambridge examinations. History =India= The first school in Delhi to offer the Senior Cambridge examination was the Cambridge School at Daryaganj. After 1972, the Senior Cambridge examinations were largely superseded by the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) and the Indian School Certificate (ISC) examinations conducted by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), an autonomous body established in 1958. =Malaysia= During the Japanese occupation of Malaysia in World War II, pupils who sat their Senior Cambridge examinations at some schools in 1941 had to wait until 1946 to learn their results. It was replaced with the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia during the late 1970s. =Pakistan= At its independence from British India in 1947, Pakistan inherited a number of schools that offered Senior Cambridge examinations. But one of the first schools to offer Senior Cambridge was Cathedral School Hall Road Lahore. Since then, the number of schools with a Senior Cambridge curriculum expanded greatly, and Cambridge schools are prominent among the premier educational institutions of Pakistan. =Singapore= Prior to the introduction of the O Levels examinations by UCLES, students sat for the Senior Cambridge examinations at the end of their four-year secondary school studies. This is equivalent to the General Certificate of Secondary Education (or GCSE) in England. The Higher School Certificate (HSC) examinations were replaced by A Levels (roughly equivalent to the present British \\"sixth form\\") in 1973.

Although he was a member of the Silla royal family, he became a victim of the power struggle among the royal family members during the late 9th century.Korea through the Ages Vol.1 p111 Gung Ye at The Academy of Korean Studies He became a rebel leader against the unpopular Silla government, which almost abandoned the affairs of their subjects for the struggle for power among royal family members. Gung Ye at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture  Birth  The exact date of Gung Ye's birth is unknown, but records assume that he was a son of King Gyeongmun; Gung Ye at Doosan Encyclopedia his mother is said to be a beloved lady of the court. According to legend, Gung Ye was born on the traditional holiday of Dano. The royal seer prophesied that a baby born on Dano would bring disaster to the nation, and the court officials and royal family members urged to the king to get rid of the infant. So the king ordered his servants to kill him. However, when the troops rushed to the residence of Gung Ye's mother, she threw her baby from the second floor, with her maid hiding in nearby bushes to catch the baby. Although her plot tricked the soldiers, the maid had accidentally poked the left eye of the baby, causing Gung Ye to lose one eye. She hid Gung Ye and raised him secretly; when she died, Gung Ye became a Buddhist monk at Sedalsa (ÏÑ∏Îã¨ÏÇ¨), a Buddhist temple.  Revolt  At the time, the monarch of Silla was Queen Jinseong (Gung Ye's half sister), who was the third and the last female head of state in Korean history (the other two being: Queen Seondeok of Silla and Jindeok of Silla). Queen Jinseong was a powerless ruler and the government was largely corrupted by interventions of royal family members and rampant bribery among members of the royal court. Queen Jinseong at Doosan Encyclopedia The corrupt government continuously exploited the peasants and farmers, and after a year of famine, massively raised taxes in 889 which led to many revolts and rebellions.Korea through the Ages Vol.1 pp 100-101 Local aristocrats, called hojok (hangul:Ìò∏Ï°±, hanja:Ë±™Êóè) emerged as de facto rulers of many provinces, with the attention of government concentrated on suppression of rebellion and their own power struggles.Korea through the Ages Vol.1 p103 Among the rebel leaders and local aristocrats, Gi Hwon and Yang Gil gained the most power. Gung Ye first joined the troops of Gi Hwon in 891 but left shortly after as Gi Hwon did not fully trust him. Gi Hwon at The Academy of Korean Studies Gung Ye joined Yang Gil's rebellion force in 892, Yang Gil at Doosan EncyclopediaIl-yeon, Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea, translated by Tae- Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book Two, page 126. Silk Pagoda (2006). and became leading general of the rebel forces by defeating the local Silla army and other rebel groups. Most local aristocrats of Myeongju and Paeseo, including Wang Gun, submitted to his force, making him even more powerful than his master Yang Gil. Silla, after nearly a millennium as a centralized kingdom was quickly declining, and Gung Ye instigated his own rebellion in present-day Kaes≈èng in 898. After turning against his master, Yang Gil, he eventually defeated and subjugated him and other local lords in central Korea to proclaim himself king of Hugoguryeo in 901.With his rival Gyeon Hwon's Hubaekje taking control of the peninsula's southwest, he opened up the Later Three Kingdoms period of Korean History, a reference to the so-called Three Kingdoms period of Korea, several centuries earlier.  Downfall  Gung Ye changed the country's name to Majin in 904, and moved the capital to Cheorwon in the following year. Since Cheorwon was a fortress located in a mountainous area, he moved people from the populous city of Cheongju and expanded his rule into the Chungcheong region, taking control of almost two-thirds of the land once controlled by Silla. In the same year Gung Ye took over Pyeongyang and called for total destruction of the state of Silla. Searching for a better way to unite his citizens, he wanted a more potent unifying theology. Therefore, around 905, he turned to religion. at Korean Encyclopedia of Ethnic Culture He decided what was needed to unite people under his power was religious faith, and using his previous occupation as a Buddhist monk, he referred to himself as Maitreya Buddha, who came to the world to guide and save the suffering people from all hardship.Korea through the Ages Vol.1 p112 He changed the name of his kingdom to Taebong in 911. In his later days, it is recorded that Gung Ye started to suffer from paranoia. He accused many arbitrarily of treason and sentenced anyone who opposed him to death, including Kang, one of his wives, and his two sons. As a result, in 918 four of his own top generals ‚Äì Hong Yu (hangul:ÌôçÏú†, hanja:Ê¥™ÂÑí), Bae Hyeongyeong (hangul:Î∞∞ÌòÑÍ≤Ω, hanja:Ë£µÁéÑÊÖ∂), Sin Sung-gyeom and Bok Jigyeom (hangul:Î≥µÏßÄÍ≤∏, hanja:ÂçúÊô∫Ë¨ô) ‚Äì overthrew Taebong and enthroned Wang Geon, one of Gung Ye's followers and the previous chief minister, of his nation, as king. Gung Ye is said to have escaped the palace, but was killed shortly thereafter either by a soldier or by peasants who mistook him for a thief. Soon thereafter, the Goryeo dynasty was proclaimed, and Wang Geon went on to defeat the rivaling Silla and Hubaekje to reunite the three kingdoms in 936. Taejo at Doosan Encyclopedia  Alternative theory of origin  Some historians present a theory that states that Gung Ye was, in fact, a direct descendant of Go Anseung, who had been the ruler of Goguryeo-Guk, which had been a failed Goguryeo revival state. Records of Silla reported that Go Anseung was given the surname of the Silla Royal Family, \\"Kim.\\" Therefore, Gung Ye's commonly known origin as a prince of Silla was right in a way, but Gung Ye being a son of a king of Silla may have not been true.Seo Byeongguk (ÏÑúÎ≥ëÍµ≠), The History of Balhae Empire (Î∞úÌï¥Ï†úÍµ≠ÏÇ¨) p36, Seohaemunjib, Paju, 2005. .  Legacy  Even though Gung Ye was not able to keep his rule and achieve the reunification of the Korean peninsula under his rule, many scholars today are attempting to review the true character of Gung Ye. Historical records regarding Gung Ye are negative, since many historians during the Goryeo Dynasty tried to justify the coup by Wang Geon that dethroned Gung Ye, in order to give legitimacy to the dynasty. However, even after the founding of Goryeo, many people rejected the rule of Wang Geon and rebelled against the newly formed dynasty; some even voluntarily defected to Gyeon Hwon's Hubaekje. It can be assumed that many people, even after the coup that crowned Wang Geon, favored the rule of Gung Ye and that he was not a total despot as described in history. Some scholars explain Gung Ye's self-proclamation as Buddha as an attempt to strengthen his power, since he, as a royal family member of Silla, had no influence over powerful local landlords and merchants, so he tried to use the power of religion in order to keep his rule, which did not prove to be effective.

Chase wrote about the incident in Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex. This book, published in 1821, would inspire Herman Melville to write Moby-Dick. Chase was born in Nantucket, Massachusetts, the son of Phebe (Meader) and Judah Chase. Sinking of Essex As first mate of Essex, 21-year-old Owen Chase left Nantucket on August 12, 1819 on a two-and-a-half-year whaling voyage. On the morning of November 20, 1820, a sperm whale (alleged to be around ), twice rammed Essex, sinking her west of South America. The closest known islands, the Marquesas, were more than to the west and the captain of Essex, George Pollard, intended to make for them but the crew, led by Chase, feared the islands might be inhabited by cannibals and voted to make for South America. Unable to sail against the trade winds, the boats had to sail south for before they could use the Westerlies to turn towards South America, which would still lie another to the east.Edward Leslie & Sterling Seagrave Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors Houghton Mifflin Harcourt 1998 pp. 251‚Äì253 Of the 21 men in three whale boats who began the journey, eight survived: three who chose to remain on a barely habitable island and five in two boats who attempted to reach South America and who were forced to resort to cannibalism to remain alive. Return to Nantucket Along with three other survivors of Essex, Chase returned to Nantucket on Eagle on June 11, 1821 to find he had a 14-month-old daughter he had never seen named Phoebe. An account of the homecoming was later published in a magazine. A large crowd had gathered at the docks to see the survivors arrive and as they disembarked, had parted without a sound. The survivors walked alone to their homes without a word being spoken.Thomas Farel Heffernan Stove by a Whale: Owen Chase and the Essex Wesleyan University Press 1990 pp. 120 - 134 Within four months and with the help of a ghostwriter, he completed an account of the disaster, the Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale- Ship Essex; this was used by Herman Melville as one of the inspirations for his novel Moby-Dick. Return to the sea In December 1821 Chase signed on as first mate on the whaler Florida which sailed on December 20 from New Bedford, Massachusetts, the crew list contains the only extant physical description of Chase; 24 years old, five feet 10 inches, dark complexioned and brown haired. After whaling in the same area where the Essex sank, the vessel returned to New Bedford on November 26, 1823. Chase was again greeted by a daughter he had never seen, 18-month-old Lydia. On September 14, 1824 a son William was born and Chase's wife Peggy died two weeks later. Nine months later Chase married Nancy Joy, the widow of Matthew Joy who was the first of the Essex survivors to die. Two months later Chase sailed again, as captain of the Winslow. The Winslow fished the Japan grounds before continuing east to dock briefly in San Francisco before sailing for the Pacific ground and finally returning to New Bedford on June 20, 1827. In mid-August Winslow set sail for the Brazil Banks but was badly damaged in a severe storm south of the Canary Islands that also sank two whaling ships and damaged three more. The ship was forced to return to New Bedford where it took nine months to repair. The ship sailed for the Pacific grounds in mid July 1828, returning early July 1830. Relatively wealthy from his successful whaling voyages, Chase now stayed in Nantucket for two years to supervise the construction at the Brant Point shipyards of his own whaler, the Charles Carrol which sailed on October 10, 1832 for a three and a half year voyage. Nine months into the voyage, Chase's wife gave birth to a daughter named Adeline. Nancy Chase died several weeks later. Chase's brother Joseph, captain of Catherine, was told of the tragedy several months later and passed the news on to Chase when they met in the Pacific ground in August 1834. Charles Carrol returned to Nantucket in March 1836 and on April 5 Chase married Eunice Chadwick. In August, Chase departed on another three and a half year whaling voyage. Sixteen months later Eunice gave birth to Charles. Herman Melville wrote of the news in his copy of Chase's narrative: > \\"For, while I was in the Acushnet we heard from some whaleship that we > spoke, that the captain of the \\"Charles Carrol\\" - that is Owen Chase - had > recently received letters from home, informing him of the certain infidelity > of his wife, the mother of several children, one of them being the lad of > sixteen, whom I alluded to as giving me a copy of his father's narrative to > read. We also heard that this receipt of this news had told most heavily > upon Chase, & and that he was of the deepest gloom.\\" We know from the ship's log that Charles Carrol met the whaler Hero in the grounds, the captain of which was Reuben Joy, brother of Matthew Joy from Essex, and that the two vessels remained together for the unusually long time of two months. It is speculated that it was Joy who passed on the news to Chase. Charles Carrol docked at Holmes Hole on February 15, 1840 where Chase left the ship and travelled to Nantucket. There he filed for divorce on February 18, which was granted on July 7. Retirement Two months after the divorce was finalized, Chase married for the fourth and final time to Susan Coffin Chase. He never sailed again. Memories of the harrowing ordeal haunted Chase. He suffered terrible headaches and nightmares. Later in his life, Chase began hiding food in the attic of his Nantucket house on Orange Street and was eventually institutionalized. He remained there for an estimated 8 years and was subsequently released. In popular culture *In 2013, the television movie The Whale was broadcast on BBC One on 22 December 2013, wherein an elderly Thomas Nickerson recounted the events of Essex. Chase was played by Jonas Armstrong. *In 2015, the film In The Heart of the Sea, directed by Academy Award Winner Ron Howard, was released on December 11, 2015 with Chase being portrayed by Chris Hemsworth. *A dramatized documentary, entitled Revenge of the Whale, had already been produced and broadcast on 7 September 2001 by NBC. The Chase character was voiced by actor David Harbour.

In 2000, he started his \\"The Supermen Lovers\\" project in tribute to the Johnny Guitar Watson track \\"Superman Lover\\". After the release of \\"Marathon Man,\\" released on his own label, Atlan composed Starlight. Mani Hoffman joined him on this project, singing and co-writing its lyrics with Atlan. Backing vocals were provided by Onili. The track contains a sample of \\"East Coast ‚Äì The Rock\\" composed by Charlie Wallert. Atlan released his first album, The Player on BMG in 2001.

LaGuardia High School and Greenwich High School. During high school, Tom was a member of the jazz ensemble as an upright bass player. He was also a member of the prestigious Tri-State McDonald's High School Jazz Ensemble, which landed him an audition with Elizabeth Swados. Swados was impressed by his musical talents and cast Tom in her 1987 production of Swing as a part of the Next Wave festival at BAM. In the production, Tom played guitar, upright bass and sang both a solo number and as a member of the ensemble. After graduating high school, Freund immediately became involved in the Off Broadway theater scene while taking classes at Columbia University. During this time, Tom was also playing clubs in New York City and doing some TV music work. In 1991, Tom enrolled at Pitzer College. Through a mutual friend, Freund met Ben Harper. The two formed a duo and in 1992 released a record on Cardas Records entitled Pleasure and Pain.Biography at the Tom Freund Official Web Site  Career  The limited- release of Pleasure And Pain in 1992 helped launch both Freund and Harper's careers.

In 1998, Freund released his solo debut, North American Long Weekend, on the Mercury subsidiary Red Ant Records.

Freund found influence for the funky \\"Freezedance\\" in the work of James Brown.Press at Hug Trees In regards to the album, Freund said, \\"I've been writing and making music for a long time. Becoming a father just added a beautiful new layer to the whole experience for me. On Hug Trees, my daughter Delilah is my co-producer, my audience, my muse. We created these songs together over the last couple of years. It was very natural to just go ahead and make a record.\\"Bio at Hug Trees A summer tour with Ben Harper helped rekindle the old friends' collaborative spirits, which led to Harper getting involved as producer of Collapsible Plans, Freund's fifth full-length album. The album, released in 2008, also featured piano and vocal contributions from Jackson Browne on two tracks.

The 11 track album includes collaborations with Ben Harper and Serena Ryder.The record was successfully funded through a PledgeMusic campaign. Although admitting to having some trepidations about going the crowd-sourcing route, Freund wound up a believer. \\"I'm very endeared by the Pledge experience,\\" he confesses. \\"It showed me that people wanted to engage in it. That was moving for me and got me excited.\\"Two Moons Press Release at Guitar World To promote his album \\"Two Moons\\" Tom Freund toured in October and November 2014 in Europe as solo headliner (Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Czech Republic and The Netherlands) and then subsequently opened for Brett Dennen in London, Amsterdam, Barcelona, and Madrid In 2015 Tom Freund opened three dates in the UK (London, Manchester, Birmingham) for Ben Harper.

One part was made of synthesizer-based new-age pieces, similar to Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, the other themes are typically Japanese. One was based on the use of taiko, the folkloric drums backing Noh polyphonic chants sung by a chorus of seven women ‚Äî This is Kawai's signature since Mamoru Oshii's critically acclaimed and cult anime feature film, Ghost In The Shell. The other was the remaining meditative part combining Zen music with the soundtrack's natural audio effects.Audio sample: 40 sec. of Hyakkin theme (utai) (courtesy of Screen Archives & Kenji Kawai)Audio sample: 40 sec. of Intermission theme (zen) (courtesy of Screen Archives & Kenji Kawai) Special Edition =Home cinema= Due to the technical limitations of video formats the original 360¬∞, bipolar, multidisplay system was reduced to a straight and flat projection which reduces the three dimensional experience and immersion felt in the pavilion version. =Video= The Special Edition allows a better visibility of the overall film which was reduced in the pavilion due to viewers walking on the floor screen monitor and slope viewers standing in front of the wall widescreens.Video amateur: Sho-Hoprogram filmed from the slope (Sho-Ho) (courtesy of Hideo) A benefit of the single screen projection is the removal of the mosaic effect, on the main screen, due to the PNP (Plasma Network System) architecture. =Audio= The soundtrack of the OVA editions is available in both stereo and DD5.1 multichannel versions ‚Äî the latter being more faithful to the 6.1 channel surround sound original format. Overview =Musical drama= The tale is of mixed genres, from Science- Fiction to Ecology and through Mythology to Fantasy. It is a three-act musical drama concept with a prologue and epilogue, both named intermission, by Kenji Kawai who is the composer of the score. The characters' introduction and drama is narrated through the lyrics of the opera-like Noh chanted recitation, which is self referred to as utai () within the movie. =Plot= The plot of Open Your Mind follows the extra‚Äìterrestrial origin of life coming from outerspace as six deities (Intermission act), evolving into water (Sho-ho) who then emerge into the air (Hyakkin) and to the ground (Ku-nu). Each of these creatures rules one of the six elements of the godai philosophy ‚Äî Earth, Water, Fire, Wind (referred to as kaze in the Hyakkin chant), Sky and Consciousness (referred to as \\"Awakening\\" in the movie's title). =Characters= *Pan (, \\"Pantheism\\") :The three headed goddess sending the generals to Earth. Her six arms physical aspect remembers Benzaiten, Japanese pantheism goddess of music, arts, sciences, wisdom and a protective figure. *The 6 Riki-Shou (, \\"Generals\\") Riki-shou figure dolls sculpted by Yuuki Ishiyama. **Sho-Ho () **Hyakkin (, \\"Hundred-Bird\\") **Ku-Nu (, \\"Dog Being\\") **Batoh **Ryo-Ketsu **Kon-Goh *Chimeras (, kimera) =Possible interpretations= Open Your Mind starts as a kind of space journey and exploration of a foreign planet by an advanced civilization. The time is unexplained: it could be an offworld intelligence form visiting our planet, or it could be future human travellers visiting a remote galaxy. The Ark of Awakening can be regarded as a futuristic version of Noah's Ark. Also it could be a fabricated dream, √† la Soylent Green, experienced by one of our descendants willing to learn how precious and beautiful the Earth was in its prime and experienced through a chronological and geographical exploration of the planet. Dreams are a classic theme in Oshii's production including Urusei Yatsura: Beautiful Dreamer and The Red Spectacles. The pavilion concept's name \\"Mountain of Dreams\\" is probably not a coincidence. According to the theory, agreed by Oshii (quote interview), that the futuristic projection of Science Fiction is nothing more than a metaphorous description of the present and current society, just like Montesquieu (in Persian Letters) and Voltaire (in L'Ing√©nu) implicitly describing -criticizing- their own country through the eyes of a foreign character or civilization, this work could be viewed as a warning (or \\"Awakening\\") to preserve our, current, highly menaced, biosphere and ecosystem before it is too late. This film was presented at the World Exposition hence its universal message and collective matter. The original title \\"Ark of Awakening\\" (Mezame no hakobune), is a double reference to the Bible's \\"Noah's Ark\\" and to Buddha, which means \\"awakened\\". In this perspective the movie can be interpreted as a futuristic, post-flood, returning trip to Earth on board an ark ship with the featured creatures being part of the breeding stock of saved animals. Vis-√†-vis the amount of religious references being Shinto (animist presentation of nature as a living power, lyrics about kami, kagami or mikoto), Buddhism (mandala, music, \\"zen\\" blue shaded photography, animal headed anthropomorph beings), the Bible (Noah's Ark, Great Flood, Genesis) or the Greek mythology (Centaur, Chimera), and connecting them with the depiction of fantasy ancient or future- races that are the mysterious creatures, this work could also be regarded as a mythological tale of Creation (or Genesis), in the likes of Stanley Kubrick's Space Odyssey. Story =Opening= This introduction begins with the Buddhist representation of the cosmos through mandala shaped cogwheels emitting a mechanical clockwork sound. The following sequence is set in space with a liquid planet soon entered by six shining globes (the Riki-Shou sent by Pan) moving at fast speed and coming from each side of the screen. =Intermission: Riki-Shou (prologue)= This first live-action scene is set in a foggy forest (which is also an Element in the gogy≈ç philosophy), inhabited by a group of three mysterious anthropomorph creatures. They are standing still, silent, glowing in their shining white togas, they look like some kind of anthropomorph gods of Buddhist mythology. They are the Riki-Shou, the animal headed generals, sent by Pan. The creature standing in front of the trio is Ku-Nu, the dog face Riki-Shou, on his right is Hyakkin, the eagle faced, while on his left stands Sho-Ho, the fish head general.Ku-nu bronze statue used to shoot the forest scene The action is seen in first person view through the eyes of an untold character which makes the viewer the main character of this story. After a while the viewer leaves the woods and the following acts will introduce the Riki-Shou, one after the other, starting with Sho-Ho. This forest scene will follow and end in the last part of the movie which is set after the Ku-Nu act. This unnarrated introduction is wrapped with sounds of nature and Buddhist music that is in homage to Kawai's previous score on the prologue of Oshii's Patlabor 2: the Movie which takes place in a Cambodian forest and features a giant Buddha statue. =Act I: Sho- Ho ()= (Sho-ho: Mizu no kioku, lit. \\"Sho-ho: Remembrance of water\\" Open Your Mind episode available from March 25 until May 24, 2005. =Act II: Hyakkin ()= (, Hyakkin: toki o wataru, lit. \\"Hundred-Bird: Across Time\\") Open Your Mind episode available from May 25 until July 24, 2005. Like a video game This act features sequences with a moving crosshair appearing on top of the 3-panel panoramic screen and locking onto flying creatures that explode in a myriad of polygons when fired upon. This presentation is close to the principle opening stage of the Panzer Dragoon 1995 classic and revolutionary Fantasy/SF 3D shooting game which had a similar use of a 180¬∞ screen, dragon back flights, shooting of fantasy flying creatures through a similar crossair and was packed with a New Age score. Mamoru Oshii is an enthusiast gamer playing games such as Wizardry and Virtua Fighter. In 2001 he envisioned a \\"living by the game concept\\" in the live-action film Avalon. =Act III: Ku-Nu ()= lit. \\"Dog Being: Remembrance of Seedling\\" Open Your Mind episode available from July 25 until September 25, 2005. Answers In this concluding act the viewer gets answers about the origins and nature of the mysterious creatures met in the forest. These were made through scienctific achievements as the civilization was actually human and used nanomachines to modify DNA sections in order to create new hybrid beings; the anthropomorph animals. Controversy The Great chain of being separates the humans from the animals. Ku-nu features a controversial sequence morphing human newborns with puppies. The shock comes less from the creation of a human-dog hybrid race through genetical modifications than from the explicit visual presentation of human and dog newborns as equals through morphing. For both ethic, philosophical and religious concerns human genetic manipulations such as cloning are forbidden and a touchy subject, or sometimes a taboo matter, in many countries in Europe and North America while not so in other parts of the globe. Even though the conception of dog has evolved since Descartes' perception and depiction of animals as just \\"mechanical beings\\", toward the modern recognition of a more complex nature as argued by the animal rights theory, there is a mostly Western conceptual difference between animals and humans, hence an established hierarchy that means dogs are still considered in some human societies as food, disposable, caged, experimental subjects or used in military warfare such as the mine-dogs (hundminen). On other hand, according to modern philosophers, the psychoanalyst Fran√ßoise Dolto and some psychologists such as Didier Pleux the baby figure has become the only remaining holy figure of agnostic societies which sums up the concept of \\"l'Enfant-Roi\\" or \\"enfant Roi\\" (French for \\"Boy King\\" literally \\"Child King\\").1 The 20th century saw the rise and crowning of the Child King which became apparent through various protection measures such as the abolition of child work, the creation of various child care and protection associations, and even the international Convention on the Rights of the Child created in 1989 and applied the following year. In 1995 Mamoru Oshii invited viewers of Ghost in the Shell to open their mind and think about a new social and legal status for autonomous, evolved Artificial Intelligence creatures. Now, ten years later, his Ark of Awakening work evokes a similar reflection about genetically modified beings and by extension to the status of animals. =Intermission: Pan (epilogue)= This second filmed part shows the theater as the silk curtains opens to reveal Pan.

Conlon started his career working for New York City newspapers in the early 1900s, as a proof-reader, and took up landscape photography as a hobby. New York Evening Telegram editor John B. Foster, who also produced the annual \\"Spalding Base Ball Guide\\", asked Conlon to take photographs of the players for the well known annual. Conlon later wrote in The Sporting News that ‚Äú'[Foster] came to know about my hobby‚Äîtaking pictures. He said to me one day, ‚ÄòCharley, they need pictures of ball players for the Guide, and there is no reason why you can‚Äôt take pictures of the players, as well as landscapes. It will be a good pickup for you, and it will be something for a day off.‚Äô‚Äù http://www.thenationalpastimemuseum.com/article/charles-conlon-every-picture- tells-story Conlon used a Graflex View camera and large format glass plate negatives before switching to film, in all he created at least 30,000 images over his career that spanned 1904-1941.http://www.thenationalpastimemuseum.com/article/charles-conlon- every-picture-tells-story Most of his archive consisted of thousands of portraits of major league baseball players, however his most famous photo is a fortunate action shot of Ty Cobb sliding into third base at Hilltop Park in 1910, upending the fielder, Jimmy Austin. This photo, and many of his images, of baseball's early stars are instantly recognizable, due to having been frequently reprinted over the years and the subject of several books, trading cards and documentaries. The Cobb photo is considered the first \\"action\\" sports photo. The Cobb photo Conlon's most famous picture: Ty Cobb stealing third, sliding into Jimmy Austin On July 23, 1910, Conlon snapped an action photo of Cobb sliding into third . For publication, the original photo was cropped on the right, taking away almost half of the image. That is the version everyone saw until Baseball's Golden Age: The Photographs of Charles M. Conlon was published in 1993. The excised portion is included and shows more of the right-side bleachers, as well as the left arm of the third base coach. Conlon was actually on the field, being a common practice of the day, \\"behind third base, under the hood of a large, tripod-supported Graflex camera\\".https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&dat;=19950604&id;=K3k1AAAAIBAJ&sjid;=0-AFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5654,794102 He was positioned to the outfield side of the third base coach's box, in foul territory. Cobb was on second. New York third baseman Jimmy Austin was playing in for a possible sacrifice bunt. Cobb took off for third, directly toward Conlon, but the batter did not get the bunt down. Austin backpedaled to take the throw from the catcher. Cobb tipped Austin over and the catcher's throw sailed away into left field. Presumably Cobb could have gotten up and scored, but the book does not elaborate. Initially, there was an issue on whether Conlon got the shot or not. He changed plates, just to be safe, because he did not remember if he had squeezed the shutter bulb or not, and he knew it had potential to be a great shot. It turned out that he had, it was, and baseball had one of its most iconic images. Conlon however did not see much of a financial reward from his most famous image. In 1937, Conlon estimated he had received more than 1,000 royalty payments for the famous image, however these all ranged from only a dime to 50 cents. Many of his most famous photos now sell for five figures.http://www.thenationalpastimemuseum.com/article/charles- conlon-every-picture-tells-story Clearing Space Conlon destroyed possibly thousands of his original glass plate negatives to clear space in his small home, stating in 1937 \\"\\"Some years ago, I found that my plates were running me out of the house, so I destroyed hundreds of them. Perhaps it was a mistake, but where would I have kept them? It is possible that had we had a Cooperstown museum at the time, they would have found a haven there.\\" Later Years Conlon retired to his hometown of Troy and died in 1945, predeceased by his wife and having no children or siblings. The Sporting News / John Rogers Fraud After his death the famous archive of 8,300 negatives, less than one third of the total number of images he created, was owned by The Sporting News before it was sold in 2010 to disgraced North Little Rock, Arkansas collector and businessman John Rogers. Rogers was arrested on multiple charges including fraud surrounding sports memorabilia and several newspaper and famous photographers archives, including the Conlon Collection, in 2016 after his home and office was raided in 2013.http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2016/09/12/arkansas- business-feds-allege-fraud-by-nlr-sports-collector-john-rogers In December 2015 a Arkansas judge ruled the negatives could be sold to pay off some of the millions of dollars in debt owed by Rogers.http://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/charles-conlon-photo-archive- could-be-sold-soon/ The archive, now consisting of 7,462 negatives with no record of where the missing negatives went while in Rogers possession, was sold by Heritage Auctions for $1,792,500.https://sports.ha.com/itm/baseball/the-charles-m-conlon- photographic-archive-7-462-original- negatives-/a/7160-80082.s?ic4=OtherResults-SampleItem-071515 Rogers is also being sued by several newspapers and the family of George Burke for fraud as thousands of original negatives from several archives have come up missing.http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-sports-archives- lawsuit-20140813-story.html References * Amedio, Steve. \\"Underexposed: Only after his death did Albany's Conlon gain fame for baseball photos\\".

This appears to be connected with various speech taboos between certain kin or at particular times, such as during a mourning period for women or during initiation ceremonies for men, as was also the case with Caucasian Sign Language but not Plains Indian Sign Language, which did not involve speech taboo, or deaf sign languages, which are not encodings of oral language. There is some similarity between neighboring groups and some contact pidgin similar to Plains Indian Sign Language in the American Great Plains. Sign languages appear to be most developed in areas with the most extensive speech taboos: the central desert (particularly among the Warlpiri and Warumungu), and western Cape York.Kendon, A. (1988) Sign Languages of Aboriginal Australia: Cultural, Semiotic and Communicative Perspectives. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 60 Complex gestural systems have also been reported in the southern, central, and western desert regions, the Gulf of Carpentaria (including north-east Arnhem Land and the Tiwi Islands), some Torres Strait Islands, and the southern regions of the Fitzmaurice and Kimberley areas. Evidence for sign languages elsewhere is slim, but they have been noted as far south as the south coast (Jaralde Sign Language) and there are even some accounts from the first few years of the 20th century of the use of sign by people from the south west coast. However, many of the codes are now extinct, and very few accounts have recorded any detail. Reports on the status of deaf members of such Aboriginal communities differ, with some writers lauding the inclusion of deaf people in mainstream cultural life, while others indicate that deaf people do not learn the sign language and, like other deaf people isolated in hearing cultures, develop a simple system of home sign to communicate with their immediate family. However, an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander dialect of Auslan exists in Far North Queensland (extending from Yarrabah to Cape York), which is heavily influenced by the indigenous sign languages and gestural systems of the region. Sign languages were noted in north Queensland as early as 1908 (Roth). Early research into indigenous sign was done by the American linguist La Mont West, and later, in more depth, by English linguist Adam Kendon. Languages Kendon (1988) lists the following languages: * Arrernte Sign Language ** * Dieri (Diyari) Sign Language ** (extinct) * Djingili Sign Language * (non-Pama‚ÄìNyungan) * Jaralde Sign Language (extinct) * Kaititj (Kaytetye): Akitiri Sign Language ** * Kalkutungu Sign Language * (extinct) * Manjiljarra Sign Language * Mudbura Sign Language * * Ngada Sign Language * Pitha Pitha Sign Language * (extinct) * Torres Strait Islander Sign Language * Umpila Sign Language * * Warlmanpa Sign Language ** * Warlpiri Sign Language ** * Warluwara Sign Language * (extinct) * Warumungu (Warramunga) Sign Language ** * Western Desert Sign Language (Kardutjara, Yurira Watjalku) * * Worora Kinship Sign Language * Yir Yoront Sign Language * * Yol≈ãu (Murngin) Sign Language \\\\---- :* \\"Developed\\" (Kendon 1988) :** \\"Highly developed\\" Miriwoong Sign Language is also a developed or perhaps highly developed language. With the decline of Aboriginal oral and signed languages, an increase in communication between communities and migration of people to Cairns, an Indigenous sign language has developed in far northern Queensland, based on mainland and Torres Strait Islander sign languages such as Umpila Sign Language.

Since August 2016 it is commanded by Colonel Ohad Nagma. Military shoulder tags History Established in 1966, 401 Brigade is one of the youngest brigades of the IDF. It took its current form in 1985. The brigade was initially composed of the 46th and 195th Armored Battalions and the 52nd and 34th Infantry Battalions, which were eventually converted to armor. The 34th Battalion was eventually disbanded and re-established in 1988 as an anti-tank battalion, later designated as the 94th \\"Duchifat\\" (, hoopoe) Mechanized Infantry Battalion. In 2002 it was returned to the brigade, and in 2005 was transferred to the Judea and Samaria Territorial Division. =War of Attrition= The brigade was formed by expanding and splitting the 14th Armored Brigade together with which they held the 160 kilometers long Suez Canal defensive line in Sinai. The brigade was the first to be equipped with American \\"Patton\\" M60 tanks. =Yom Kippur War= Along with the 188th Brigade on the Golan Heights the brigade suffered heavy losses in the early days of the war. the 195th Battalion ◊ê◊ì◊ù Adam belonged to the brigade in the war. =Seventies= The brigade was re- formed and returned to Sinai to continue much the same manner as it did before the war, it was included in the evacuation of Sinai under the Camp David peace agreement with Egypt, moving to the lower Jordan Valley. In 1981 195th Battalion was transferred to the 500th Armored Brigade, although a year later the brigade received the 9th Battalion. =Operation \\"Peace for the Galilee\\"/ Lebanon War= In the war the brigade took part as a part of the Eastern Corps through the Lebanon ridge. One of the brigade's battalions took part in the Sultan Yaakub engagement, making it all the way to the Beirut-Damascus highway. =Eighties and Nineties= The brigade alternated between varied infantry missions in the West Bank, mainly in the Jordan Valley, with tank missions in the Security Zone in south Lebanon. =2nd Intifada= Since 2000 the brigade has been serving in the Israeli occupied territories, doing mostly infantry and police duty. It has been re-equipping with Israeli-made Merkava tanks to replace the Magach. =2nd Lebanon war= In July 2006, when the 2006 Lebanon War broke, the 401st Brigade was among the first units to travel up north into battle. The brigade fought mostly in the Eastern zone, by the villages of Markabeh, Bint Jbeil and the Salooky Valley. The 401st Brigade lost 12 of its soldiers in battle, with four killed after their Puma armored engineering vehicle was struck; dozens were injured. =Operation Cast Lead= In 2009, the brigade played a vital role in the Operation Cast Lead. The brigade entered the Gaza Strip through the Netzarim Corridor and kept up its advance until it had reached the coast, effectively cutting the strip in half.http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3660868,00.html After the operation, the brigade resumed training. = Operation Protective Edge = The Merkava Mk.

A white solid, it is used widely as an oxidant in organic synthesis. mCPBA is often preferred to other peroxy acids because of its relative ease of handling. mCPBA is a strong oxidizing agent that may cause fire upon contact with flammable material. Preparation and purification mCPBA can be prepared by reacting m-Chlorobenzoyl chloride with a basic solution of hydrogen peroxide, followed by acidification. It is sold commercially as a self-stable mixture that is less than 72% mCPBA, with the balance made up of m-chlorobenzoic acid (10%) and water. The peroxyacid can be purified by washing the commercial material with a solution buffered at pH = 7.5. Peroxyacids are generally slightly less acidic than their carboxylic acid counterparts, so one can extract the acid impurity by careful control of pH. The purified material is reasonably stable against decomposition if stored at low temperatures in a plastic container. In reactions where the exact amount of mCPBA must be controlled, a sample can be titrated to determine the exact amount of active oxidant.  Reactions The main areas of use are the conversion of ketones to esters (Baeyer-Villiger oxidation), epoxidation of alkenes (Prilezhaev reaction), conversion of silyl enol ethers to silyl Œ±-hydroxy ketones (Rubottom oxidation), oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides and sulfones, and oxidation of amines to produce amine oxides. The following scheme shows the epoxidation of cyclohexene with mCPBA. :400px The epoxidation mechanism is concerted: the cis or trans geometry of the alkene starting material is retained in the epoxide ring of the product. The transition state of the Prilezhaev reaction is given below: 350x350px The geometry of the transition state, with the peracid bisecting the C-C double bond, allows the two primary frontier orbital interactions to occur: œÄC=C (HOMO) to œÉ*O-O (LUMO) and nO (HOMO, regarded as a filled p orbital on a sp2 hybridized oxygen) to œÄ*C=C (LUMO), corresponding, in arrow-pushing terms, to formation of one C-O bond and cleavage of the O-O bond and formation of the other C-O bond and cleavage of the C=C œÄ bond.

He was one of the greatest thinkers of the later Joseon period, wrote highly influential books about philosophy, science and theories of government, held significant administrative positions, was a close confidant of King Jeongjo (ruled 1776-1800), and was noted as a poet. His philosophical position is often identified with the Silhak (practical learning) school, and his concerns are better seen as explorations of Neo-Confucian themes. He spent 18 years in exile in Gangjin, South Jeolla province, from 1801 until 1818, on account of his membership of the Southerners (Nam-in) faction, and also because of the Catholic faith of his elder brother. His clan originated in Naju, South Jeolla Province. At birth he was given the courtesy title (ÂàùÂ≠ó choja) Gwi‚Äônong (Ê≠∏Ëæ≤), and later he was also known by the ja Miyong (ÁæéÈèû) and Songbu (È†åÁî´)ÁæéÂ∫∏); among his ho (Ëôü, pen-names) were Saam (‰øüËè¥), Tagong (Á±úÁøÅ), Taesu (ËãîÂèü), Jahadoin (Á¥´ÈúûÈÅì‰∫∫), Cheolmasanin (ÈêµÈ¶¨Â±±‰∫∫), Dasan (Ëå∂Â±±), Yeoyudang (ËàáÁå∂Â†Ç, the name of his house), and Mundo (ÊñáÂ∫¶, his name as a poet). Korean Catholics sometimes claim that he was baptized with the name John Baptist, but there is no documentary proof of this. Biography =Family history= Dasan's father was Jeong Jae-won (‰∏ÅËºâÈÅ†, 1730‚Äì1792). His eldest brother Yak-hyeon (Ëã•Èââ, 1751‚Äì1821) was the son of a first wife, while Jeong Yak-jong (Ëã•Èçæ, 1760‚Äì1801), Yak-jeon (Ëã•Èäì, 1758‚Äì1816), and Yakyong were the sons of their father's second wife, Suk-in (Ê∑ë‰∫∫, 1730‚Äì1770) from the Haenam Yun Â∞π family. There was one daughter from this second marriage. Four other daughters were later born of a third marriage. Dasan's father's family traced their descent back to Jeong Ja- geup (‰∏ÅÂ≠ê‰ºã, 1423‚Äì1487) who in 1460 first took a government position under King Sejo. Eight further generations then followed his example. Jeong Si-yun (‰∏ÅÊôÇÊΩ§, 1646‚Äì1713) and his second son Do-bok (ÈÅìÂæ©, 1666‚Äì1720) were the last of the line, since the Southerners‚Äô faction to which the family belonged lost power in 1694. Si-yun retired to a house in Mahyeon-ri to the east of Seoul (now known as Namyangju) in 1699, which was to be Dasan's birthplace. His eldest son, Do-tae (ÈÅìÊ≥∞) lived there and was Dasan's direct ancestor. The Southerners remained excluded from official positions until a brief period that began during the reign of King Jeongjo, when Dasan's father was appointed magistrate of Jinju county, thanks to his strong links with the powerful Chae Je-gong (Ëî°ÊøüÊÅ≠, 1720‚Äì99), who rose until he was appointed third state councillor in 1788. In 1762, the execution of Crown Prince Sado by his father the king so shocked Jeong Jae-won that he withdrew from official life and returned to his home in Mahyeon-ri. This explains the courtesy name Gwi‚Äônong (‚Äòback to farming‚Äô) his father gave Dasan, who was born in the same year. As a result, Dasan grew up receiving intense intellectual training from his now unoccupied father.Setton, Mark. Chong Yakyong. page 54 The source of Dasan's intellectual interests can be traced to the influence of the great scholar Udam Jeong Si- han (ÊÑöÊΩ≠ ‰∏ÅÊôÇÁø∞, 1625‚Äì1707) of the same clan, who taught Jeong Si-yun briefly and was then the main teacher of Dasan's ancestor Jeong Do-tae as well as his brother Do-je (1675‚Äì1729). One of the most significant thinkers in the next generation was the philosopher-scholar Seongho Yi Ik (ÊòüÊπñ ÊùéÁÄ∑, 1681‚Äì1763) and he saw Udam as the authentic heir of Toegye Yi Hwang (ÈÄÄÊ∫™ ÊùéÊªâ, 1501‚Äì1570). Jeong Do-je transmitted the teachings of Udam to the next generations of the family and so they were passed to Dasan's father and Dasan himself. Similarly, Dasan's mother was descended from the family of the famous Southerner scholar- poet Gosan Yun Seon-do (Â≠§Â±± Â∞πÂñÑÈÅì, 1587‚Äì1671). Yun's great-grandson Gongjae Yun Du-seo (ÊÅ≠ÈΩã Â∞πÊñóÁ∑ñ, 1668‚Äì1715), well known for his skills as a painter, was Dasan's maternal great-grandfather. He and his elder brother were close to Seongho Yi Ik and his brothers, and are credited with reviving the study of the Six Classics, as well as the thought of Toegye.Setton, Mark. Chong Yakyong. page 55 =Early life= By the age of 6, Dasan's father was impressed by his powers of observation. By the age of 9 he had composed a small collection of poems. In 1776, Dasan was married to Hong Hwabo of the Pungsan Hong clan, the daughter of a royal secretary; in that year he moved to Seoul, where his father received an appointment in the Board of Taxation after the accession of King Jeongjo. When he was 15, Dasan was introduced to the writings of Seongho Yi Ik by one of his descendants, Yi Ga-Hwan (ÊùéÂÆ∂ÁÖ•, 1742‚Äì1801) and his brother-in-law Yi Seung-hun (ÊùéÊâøËñ∞, 1756‚Äì1801) and he was deeply impressed, resolving to devote his life to similar studies. In 1783, Dasan passed the chinsagwa (literary licentiate examination), which allowed him to enter the Seonggyungwan (national Confucian academy). In 1784 the king was deeply impressed by the ‚Äúobjectivity‚Äù of Dasan's replies to a set of questions he had formulated. This was the start of an increasingly close relationship between the king and Dasan. After the promotion of Chae Je-gong in 1788, Dasan took top place in the daegwa (higher civil service exam) in 1789 and was offered a position in the Office of Royal Decrees, together with 5 other members of the Southerner faction. This alarmed members of the opposing ‚ÄòOld Doctrine‚Äô faction, who soon realized the extent to which the Southerners were being influenced, not only by the Practical Learning introduced to China from Europe, but by Roman Catholicism itself. In 1784, Yi Byeok (ÊùéËòó, 1754‚Äì1786), a scholar who had participated in meetings to study books about the Western (European) Learning, starting in 1777, talked with Dasan about the new religion for the first time in 1784 and gave him a book about it. Whatever his own response may have been, and there is no proof that he ever received baptism, Dasan's immediate family was deeply involved in the origins of the Korean Catholic community. His older sister was married to Yi Seung-hun, the Korean who was first baptized as a Catholic in Beijing in 1784 and played a leading role in the early years of the Church's growth. The oldest of Jeong Jae-won's sons, Yak-hyeon, was married to a sister of Yi Byeok. Another daughter, from a third marriage, later married Hwang Sa-yeong (1775‚Äì1801), author of the notorious Silk Letter. Dasan's older brother, Jeong Yak-jong (Augustinus) was the leader of the first Catholic community and one of the first victims of the purge launched against Southerners, but especially against Catholics, in 1801, after the sudden death of King Jeongjo. In 1789, Yun Ji-chung, one of the first baptized and a cousin to Dasan on his mother's side, had gone to Beijing and received confirmation. Rome had forbidden Catholics to perform ancestral rituals and this was now being strictly applied by the Portuguese Franciscan bishop of Beijing Alexandre de Gouvea. When his mother died in 1791, Yun therefore refused to perform the usual Confucian ceremonies; this became public knowledge, he was accused of impiety and was executed. Some Koreans who had at first been sympathetic, horrified by the Church's rejection of hallowed traditions, turned away. Jeong Yakyong may well have been among them.Setton, Mark. Chong Yakyong. page 59 =Royal Service= Dasan was particularly interested in civil engineering and in 1792 the king, impressed by a pontoon bridge he had designed, asked him to design and supervise the construction of the walls for the Hwaseong Fortress (modern Suwon), which surrounded the palace where the king would live when he visited the new tomb he had constructed for his father. Dasan produced radically new techniques and structures, drawing on European, Chinese and Japanese sources. In 1794, after several promotions, the king appointed him as secret envoy to Gyeongi province, investigating reports of corruption. Dasan's most important task in 1795, the 60th anniversary of the birth of Crown Prince Sado, was to help the King decide on a new honorary title for his father. This was a fraught enterprise, the Prince's supporters were members of what was called the Expediency subfaction while his main enemies were members of the Principle subfaction. The Southerners were strong supporters of the King's wish to honor Sado highly and the King was more than grateful. However, he then found it prudent to send Dasan away from court for a time, appointing him to be superintendent of the post station at Geumjeong, South Pyeongan province. Here, he provided clear proof of his rejection of Catholicism by doing everything possible to persuade the Catholics working there to renounce their faith, and in particular to perform ancestral rites. Almost certainly, it was the Catholics‚Äô rejection of Confucian ritual that had turned him against them. In 1796, he was brought back to Seoul and promoted but his many enemies continued to accuse him of supporting the pro-western Catholics and he preferred to take up a position as county magistrate at Goksan in Hwanghae province. In 1799 he even withdrew to his family home but was summoned back to Seoul by the king in 1800.Setton, Mark. Chong Yakyong. page 62 =Exile= In the summer of 1800, King Jeongjo died suddenly. The new king, King Sunjo, was still only a child of 11 and power fell into the hands of the widow of King Yeongjo, often known as Queen Dowager Kim or Queen Jeongsun. Her family belonged to the factions opposed to the reformist, often Catholic, Nam-in group and she had been completely powerless during Jeongjo's reign. She at once launched an attack on the Catholics, who were denounced as traitors and enemies of the state. Jeong Yak-jong, the older brother of Jeong Yakyong, was the head of the Catholic community, he was one of the first to be arrested and executed, together with Yi Seung-hun, in the spring of 1801. His eldest son, Jeong Cheol-sang, died then too, executed a month after his father. Since he was Jeong Yak-jong's younger brother, Jeong Yakyong was sent into exile for some months in Janggi fortress in what is now Pohang, having been found after interrogation with torture not to be a Catholic believer. That might have been that, but what brought Yakyong to Gangjin, where he was forced to spend eighteen years, was the event that served as the final nail in the coffin of the early Catholic community, the Silk Letter Incident. Hwang Sa-yeong, married to one of Dasan's younger sisters, hid in a cave during the persecutions and in October 1801 he finished writing a long letter to the bishop of Beijing, giving a detailed account of the recent events, asking him to bring pressure on the Korean authorities to allow freedom of religion and, disastrously, begging him to ask the Western nations to send a large army to overthrow the Joseon dynasty so that Korea would be subject to China, where Catholicism was permitted. The man carrying this letter, written on a roll of silk wrapped round his body, was intercepted and the Korean authorities made full use of it to show that Catholics were by definition enemies of the state. The persecution was intensified and if it had not been very clear that Jeong Yakyong and Jeong Yak-jeon were in no sense Catholic believers, they would surely have been executed. Instead they were sent into exile together, parting ways at Naju, from where Jeong Yak-jeon journeyed on to the island of Heuksando, Yakyong taking the Gangjin road. His exile began in the last days of 1801, on the 23rd day of the eleventh lunar month, the 28th of December in the solar calendar. On that day, he arrived in Gangjin, South Jeolla Province. The newly arrived exile had little or no money and no friends, he found shelter in the back room of a poor, rundown tavern kept by a widow, outside the East Gate of the walled township of Gangjin, and there he lived until 1805. He called his room ‚ÄúSauijae‚Äù (room of four obligations: clear thinking, serious appearance, quiet talking, sincere actions). By 1805, much had changed in Seoul. Dowager Queen Kim had died and the young king had come of age and quickly put an end to the violence against Catholics. Three hundred had been killed and many of the rest were exiled or scattered, or had stopped practicing. Jeong Yakyong was free to move about the Gangjin area and in the spring of 1805 he walked up the hill as far as Baeknyeon-sa Temple, where he met the Venerable Hyejang, the newly arrived monk in charge of the temple, who was about ten years younger than himself. They talked and it seems that Hyejang only realized who his visitor was as he was leaving. That night he forced him to stay with him and asked to learn the I Ching from him. They quickly became close companions. Later the same year, Hyejang enabled Dasan to move out of the tavern and for nearly a year he lived in Boeun Sanbang, a small hermitage at the nearby Goseong-sa temple, which was under Hyejang's control. Finally, in the spring of 1808 he was able to take up residence in a house belonging to a distant relative of his mother, on the slopes of a hill overlooking Gangjin and its bay. It was a simple house, with a thatched roof, but it was there that the exile spent the remaining ten years of his exile, until the autumn of 1818. This is the site now known as ‚ÄúDasan Chodang.‚Äù The hill behind the house was known locally as Da-san (tea-mountain) and that was to become the name by which our exile is best known today, Dasan. Here he could teach students who lodged in a building close to his, forming a close- knit community, and he could write. In his study he accumulated a library of over a thousand books.Setton, Mark. Chong Yakyong. page 63 During his exile he is said to have written 500 volumes. This needs qualifying, since one ‚Äúwork‚Äù might fill nearly 50 volumes of the standard size, but he certainly wrote a vast quantity, some 14,000 pages, mainly in order to set out clearly a fundamental reform program for governing the country correctly according to Confucian ideals. During the years of exile he concentrated first on the Book of Changes (Yi Ching), writing in 1805 the Chuyeoksajeon. A reflection on the Classic of Poetry followed in 1809. He wrote on politics, ethics, economy, natural sciences, medicine and music. After his return from exile, Dasan published his most important works: on jurisprudence Heumheumsinseo (1819); on linguistics Aeongakbi (1819); on diplomacy Sadekoryesanbo (1820); on the art of governing Mongminsimseo and on administration Gyeongsesiryeong (1822). Dasan remained in exile in Gangjin until 1818, when he was allowed to return to his family home near Seoul. Attempts to bring him back into government service were blocked by factional politics. He used Yeoyudang as his final pen-name, it was the name of the family home where he lived quietly, near the Han River, until he died in 1836, on his sixtieth wedding anniversary. The main sources for his biography are the two versions of his own ‚Äòepitaph,‚Äô Jachan myojimyeong, and a chronological biography Saam seonsaeng yeonbo composed by his great-grandson Jeong Gyu-yeong using no longer extant records.Setton, Mark. Chong Yakyong. page 66 Dasan and the 19th-century tea revival Jeong Yakyong had been living in Gangjin for several years when the Ven. Hyejang arrived from Daeheung-sa temple to take charge of Paengnyeon-sa. During those years, spent in a poor inn with very little money, Dasan's health had suffered from the low nutritional value of his food. He suffered from chronic digestive problems. Dasan and Hyejang first met on the 17th day of the 4th month, 1805, not long after Hyejang's arrival. Only a few days after, Dasan sent a poem to Hyejang requesting some tea leaves from the hill above the temple; it is dated in the 4th month of 1805, very soon after their meeting.Jeong Min:Joseonui Chamunhwa p. 144 This poem makes it clear that Dasan already knew the medicinal value of tea and implies that he knew how to prepare the leaves for drinking. It has often been claimed that Dasan learned about tea from Hyejang but this and a series of other poems exchanged between them suggests that in fact Hyejang and other monks in the region learned how to make a kind of caked tea from Dasan. This would make him the main origin of the ensuing spread of interest in tea. In 1809, the Ven. Cho-ui from the same Daeheung-sa temple came to visit Dasan in Gangjin and spent a number of months studying with him there.Jeong Min:Joseonui Chamunhwa p. 209 Again, it seems more than likely that Cho-ui first learned about tea from Dasan, and adopted his very specific, rather archaic way of preparing caked tea. After that, it was the Ven. Cho-ui who, during his visit to Seoul in 1830, shared his tea with a number of scholars. Among them, some poems were written and shared to celebrate the newly discovered drink, in particular the Preface and Poem of Southern Tea (ÂçóËå∂Âπ∑Â∫è) by Geumryeong Bak Yeong-bo.Jeong Min:Joseonui Chamunhwa p. 278 After this, Cho-ui became especially close to Chusa Kim Jeong-hui, who visited him several times bringing him gifts of tea during his exile in Jeju Island in the 1740s. A letter about Dasan's method of making caked tea has survived, dated 1830, that Dasan sent to Yi Si-Heon ÊùéÊôÇÊÜ≤ (1803‚Äì1860), the youngest pupil taught by him during his 18 years of exile in Gangjin: ‚ÄúIt is essential to steam the picked leaves three times and dry them three times, before grinding them very finely. Next that should be thoroughly mixed with water from a rocky spring and pounded like clay into a dense paste that is shaped into small cakes. Only then is it good to drink.‚ÄùBrother Anthony etc:Korean Tea Classics page 9 Thought Jeong is well-known above all for his work in synthesizing the Neo-Confucian thought of the middle Joseon dynasty. In the process, he wrote widely in various fields including law, political theory, and the Korean Confucian classics. He sought to return Korean Confucian scholarship to a direct connection with the original thought of Confucius. He called this return to the classics \\"Susa\\" learning (ÏàòÏÇ¨, Ê¥ôÊ≥ó), a reference to the two rivers that flowed through Confucius' homeland. Jeong published a number of books over various areas, including his best-known Mokminsimseo (Î™©ÎØºÏã¨ÏÑú, ÁâßÊ∞ëÂøÉÊõ∏, The Mind of Governing the People). Although he was deeply concerned about the problem of poverty during that time, Jeong deeply pondered the issue of poverty and raised questions about the role of government officials. He believed that the government and bureaucrats could and should play a major role in solving the problem of poverty. Dasan stressed the importance of the governor's administering the people with integrity and in a fair manner. According to him, the government was the ruling entity to render aid and favor to the people while the people were the subject of the government's sympathy and rule. In the service of this idea, Jeong criticized the philosophers of his time for engaging in both fruitless etymological scholarship and pursuing philosophical theory for their own sake. He argued that scholarship should be re-focused on more important concerns such as music, ritual, and law. This was not only an intellectual but also a political assertion: he argued that the gwageo examinations by which people qualified for royal service should be reformed to focus on these concerns. =Ye Philosophy= Ye philosophy takes up a large portion of the writings of Jeong Yakyong. As demonstrated by the fact that the original title of Gyeongse Yupyo (Í≤ΩÏÑ∏Ïú†Ìëú, Á∂ì‰∏ñÈÅ∫Ë°®, Design for Good Government), a flagship work of his which presents a blueprint of state management, was Bangnye Chobon (Draft for the Country's Rites), Jeong uses the concept of Ye extensively to represent what he aims to achieve with his thought. He focuses this concept on his notion of good government and later extended and branched into his works of classical studies and natural sciences.https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q;=cache:QBlEV3IADmcJ:www.ekoreajournal.net/upload/pdf/PDF4948+Jeong+Yakyong+idea&hl;=en‚â∑=us&pid;=bl&srcid;=ADGEEShJFLe6lO7AHd3Kt6-jTjJ30D3F49-bS5op5VvY0DNk7A6_LfgGmdxjtAX25SJ- rchyxVNGnRvzSuqbrAAC5aR3FvDIgMxcYT1oW_FPXGiaXefGsUoyX7GJANwMzwtSMuE_Mkn4&sig;=AHIEtbSOPybiHQgT7Pl- orGGvncRRQoQ-A =Theory of Sacrificial Rites= Dasan's theory of Korean- style sacrificial rites (Ï†úÏÇ¨, Á•≠Á•Ä) shows his socio-political concern seeking for the rule of virtue and righteous government. He intended to motivate people into making everyday practices of the human imperatives and to revitalize effectively the traditional society of the late period of Joseon dynasty which had its basis upon Ye (Á¶Æ, Confucian order). In Mokminsimseo, Dasan formulates the cognitive process of ritual practice focussing on sacrificial rites as follows. 1) The cognition of the ritual object raises the intentional movement of mind/heart toward the ritual object in the cognitive process. 2) The intentionality of mind and heart entails reverence and purification in the ritual process. Ritual practice is significant through sincerity (ÏÑ±, Ë™†) and seriousness (Í≤Ω, Êï¨). From the perspective of the cognitive science of religion, Dasan's theory relates cognition with intentional piety in the cognitive process, and combines intentional piety and reverence/purification in ritual practice. Dasan intended to regulate the excessive ritual practices of the literati and restrict popular licentious cults (ÏùåÏÇ¨, Ê∑´Á•Ä) in accordance with his cognitive formula. From his point of view, Confucianist's ritual conceptions were improper or impractical, and popular licentious cults were impious and overly enthusiastic. In order to solve these problems, He redefined Zhi Hsi's concept of seriousness as attentive concentration of convergent piety into the concept of prudential reverence as intentional pietism. Zhi Hsi's concept of seriousness contains apophatic mysticism like Zen Buddhist Quietism (Ï†ï, Èùú) by mediation, but Dasan's concept of reverence is inclined towards Cataphatic activism by contemplation. Abstract , Introduction =Land reform= Land reform was an important issue for the Silhak reformers, and Dasan elaborated upon Yu Hy≈èngw≈èn's land reform proposals. Rather than central state ownership, Dasan proposed a \\"village land system,\\" in which the village would hold its land in common and farm the land as a whole, while the products of the land would be divided based on the amount of labor contributed. Views on Dasan Professor Ogawa Haruhisa of Nishogakusha University in Tokyo is very impressed by Dasan: ‚ÄúIn addition to egalitarian ideas, Ch√¥ng Yag-yong Dasan provided something precious that had been lost at that time. He has these elements that we must learn and revive in these modern times. He formed his philosophy despite his sufferings in exile. I think he will be of interest to contemporary scholars for a long time.‚Äù Professor Peng Lin at Qinghua University, Beijing teaches the Chinese classics and has a special interest in Dasan's study of rituals. He published in the 1980s research papers on Dasan in the S√¥nggyun‚Äôgwan Journal of East Asian Studies: ‚ÄúDasan devoted great efforts in studying rites, to understanding and bringing recognition to traditional culture. I believe that Dasan‚Äôs study of rites is highly unique. He studied all the three fields in the study of ritual and this was not common even among Chinese scholars. Many can achieve only partial understanding even after a lifetime study, but Dasan studied all the ritual fields and his research is truly astounding. He wanted to create an ideal society by starting with what already existed. This shows Dasan‚Äôs humanistic interest and that intrigues me.‚Äù Professor Don Baker at the Asia Center of the University of British Columbia, Canada, is interested in Dasan for his role as an intellectual in a period of transition: ‚ÄúI think that in the twenty-first century we still need to adopt Dasan‚Äôs spirit, what I call moral pragmatism. He was a very pragmatic man. He looked at problems and said ‚Äòhow can we solve them‚Äô. But also he always kept his moral values at the front. We often have in society a material progress for the sake of material progress. Dasan wanted a material progress but a progress that creates a more moral society, therefore I call it moral pragmatism and I think that we still need such spirit today.\\" There is in Korea a revival of Jeong Yakyong's thought never seen before on that scale for any Korean philosopher. In the not distant past one could hear doubts about even the existence of a Korean philosophy. Since the liberation of Korea in 1945 Western philosophy has prevailed and philosophy departments in most Korean universities teach mainly European modern philosophy. Therefore, Dasan is of great importance as he was able to be enthusiastic for modern Western ideas but remained deeply committed to the depth of Confucianism. He was not defending a tradition for its own sake but wanted to keep the precious values of the early Chinese period because it was a foundation for man and society.

Whitten Stand E.J Whitten statue which stands outside of the Whitten Oval The E.J. Whitten Stand in February 2017 Whitten Oval (currently also known as Victoria University Whitten OvalBulldogs to play at Victoria University Whitten Oval www.westernbulldogs.com.au (16 Aug 2013)) is a stadium in the inner-western suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, located at 417 Barkly Street, West Footscray. It is the training and administrative headquarters of the Western Bulldogs Football Club, which competes in the Australian Football League (AFL), and the home ground of its women's and reserves teams which compete in AFL Women's (AFLW) and the Victorian Football League (VFL) respectively. Formerly known as the Western Oval, it was renamed in honour of Ted Whitten, a former player, captain and coach for the club. A statue of Whitten was also erected at the entrance of the oval. Background The Whitten Oval is the centrepiece of a reserve that, from 1860, was a stone quarry used by the railways. In 1866, the quarry was turned into a reserve that included botanical gardens. Other former quarries within the City of Footscray that were turned into public gardens in this era include the Yarraville Reserve, which is the site of the current Yarraville Oval, off Williamstown Road; the Yarraville Gardens, off Hyde Street; and Footscray Park, which fronts the Maribyrnong River.Ruban, L. (2013, May 11). Club History Page - West Footscray Football Club. WRFL Footy Record, 5, 47. History In 1879, after moving from ground to ground, the local council granted the local football club permission to use the Western Reserve as their home ground.Potted History - Official AFL Website In 1883, the Footscray Football Club was formed. A year later, the club began hosting games in the botanical gardens. While the gardens became known as the David Spurling Reserve, the oval within the gardens became the Western Oval. Footscray used Western Oval as its home ground almost continuously until 1997. It was absent from the ground only in 1942, when it was commandeered by military personnel during World War II; during that season, Footscray played its home games at the nearby Yarraville Oval, which was vacant because the VFA, in which the regular tenant Yarraville Football Club competed, was in recess. In 1943, the club returned to Western Oval. In 1955, the ground record attendance was set for the oval when 42,354 turned out on 9 July to see then-defending premiers Footscray defeat Collingwood by six points in Round 12, 1955. In 1965, Footscray considered leaving Western Oval, and made an application to the City of Sunshine for a lease at the new football ground it was developing at Skinner Reserve, approximately 3 km west in Braybrook; the Sunshine Council ultimately rejected the application, as it would have required the breaking of an agreement it already had with the VFA's Sunshine Football Club. In 1983, struggling VFA Division 2 club Yarraville played its home games at Western Oval on Sundays. This was the only season of the arrangement, as the club folded before the 1984 season. In 1994, the struggling Fitzroy Football Club began playing its home matches at the Western Oval, sharing the venue with Footscray, as it sought a better financial arrangement than it had received at its previous home Princes Park. In 1995, the oval was renamed the Whitten Oval, after the death of the football club's favourite son, Ted Whitten. The driveway leading from Barkly Street to the car park behind the oval was named Whitten Avenue. In 1996, the Footscray Football Club attempted to get an injunction against the Fitzroy Football Club merging with any other club in the AFL, claiming such a move would break Fitzroy's 20 year lease to play their home games at Whitten Oval. The court dismissed the claim, saying damages rather than an injunction should have been sought. Following Fitzroy's merger with Brisbane after the 1996 AFL season, the Western Bulldogs moved their primary home ground for matches from Whitten Oval to Optus Oval in Carlton, with the club still scheduled to play two home matches at Whitten Oval.http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy;=age&kw;=whitten+oval&pb;=all_ffx&dt;=enterRange&dr;=1month&sd;=01%2F01%2F1996&ed;=31%2F12%2F1997&so;=date&sf;=text&sf;=headline&rc;=200&rm;=200&sp;=adv&clsPage;=1&docID;=news970323_0139_8023 However, prior to their Round 1 encounter with Fremantle, the ground was condemned and the Fremantle match was moved to Optus Oval.http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy;=age&kw;=whitten+oval&pb;=all_ffx&dt;=enterRange&dr;=1month&sd;=01%2F01%2F1996&ed;=31%2F12%2F1997&so;=date&sf;=text&sf;=headline&rc;=200&rm;=200&sp;=adv&clsPage;=1&docID;=news970709_0183_1711 Eventually the Western Bulldogs announced their intention to no longer play AFL matches at Whitten Oval, instead playing home games at Optus Oval until moving to Docklands stadium from the 2000 season. A farewell premiership match was staged at the venue in Round 21, 1997 before a crowd of 26,704; the Bulldogs 12.14 (86) defeated 10.8 (68). After moving home matches away from the venue, the Bulldogs retain a training and administrative base at the venue. The ground also ceased to be a used as a regular cricket venue at the end of 1996. Until December 1996, it was the home of the Footscray Cricket Club, which played in the Victorian district/premier cricket competition; from 1997, the club moved to the Mervyn G. Hughes Oval in northern Footscray. After the appointment of Campbell Rose as Chief Executive of the football club in 2002, discussions commenced on a redevelopment of Whitten Oval. In September 2004, the club secured a deal for a $19.5m redevelopment, with contributions from the Federal Government ($8.0m), Western Bulldogs Forever Foundation ($5.5m), State Government ($3.0m),Media Release: Whitten Oval Rebuild On Track To Deliver The Goodshttp://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/39125/0706-56AFLVenues.pdf AFL ($1.5m) and the City of Maribyrnong ($1.0m).http://www.maribyrnong.vic.gov.au/Files/Draft_Special_Minutes_050808.pdf Construction commenced in 2005, and was completed in 2009. The renovated ground includes a 120 place childcare centre, a conference and convention centre and a state-of-the-art sports, medical, and health care centre for the Bulldogs to use as a training base.Whitten Oval - Official AFL Website of the Western Bulldogs Football Club In 2014, the ground started hosting home matches for the Western Bulldogs' reserves team, known as Footscray, which competes in the Victorian Football League. The ground has hosted matches for the club's AFL Women's team since 2017. A-League soccer team Western United held a match at the venue against Adelaide United on 26 January 2020. Adelaide won the match 4‚Äì3 in front of a crowd of 5,988. Canary Island palms Fifteen Canary Island date palm trees line the footpath north of the oval, facing Barkly Street. Three Canary Island pine trees are behind these palms. To the west of the oval, between the car park and Hocking Street, there are two more palms. Of the 15 palms that line the reserve's northern border, 10 are south of the entrance to Whitten Avenue and five are north of the entrance. Behind the palms, to the north of the entrance, is the Lions Club of Footscray Memorial Playground. Stadium The stadium had a crowd capacity of up to 25,000. The ground was known for being particularly long and narrow with deep squarish pockets, and for the wild wind which often bellowed over the ground, particularly at the Geelong Road end. These reasons, most specifically the wind, meant that the Western Oval was the site of many abnormally low scoring games, inaccurate scoring tallies and games in which more than 80% of all scoring was kicked to one end. The ground developed a demographic of the \\"ground visiting sides hated to play at\\", with passionate Bulldog supporters and its distinctive playing conditions making it an arduous task to leave with a win. In a game illustrating the worst that the Western Oval wind could offer, Footscray defeated Fitzroy in a close game, 14.9 (93) to 13.7 (85), in Round 10, 1964 ‚Äì of the total of 178 points scored in the game, only 7 were scored against the wind. When Footscray played Fitzroy in Round 17, 1927, only 6 of 173 points were kicked against the wind. In 1948's Footscray versus Geelong game, only 2 of the 58 scoring shots were made into the wind. The wind was so fierce that when the Geelong full-back, Bruce Morrison, kicked the ball off after Footscray had scored a behind, the ball floated back over his head and went through the goals. The goal umpire signalled a \\"forced behind\\". While these are extreme examples, it was common to see no more than two or three goals kicked into the wind, while 14 or 15 would be scored at the other end. Current activities Post-use as a VFL/AFL stadium, the Whitten Oval is now primarily used as the training ground for the Western Bulldogs. A number of local community groups, schools and sporting organisations utilise the ground; particularly because of its close proximity to the Melbourne CBD and local transport. The ground also plays host to a variety of commercially-oriented tenancies, including retail (The Western Bulldogs merchandise shop, Bulldogs Central) and health (Physioplus Footscray). It also headquarters the WMR (Western Metropolitan Region) division of DEECD, which oversees all government schools in Melbourne's West. The Victorian Women's Football League (VWFL) utilises the ground for games and finals. A local Rec Footy competition, the Western Bulldogs Family Day and a host of other community activities throughout the year mean the oval is constantly used. A-League side Western United play some home matches at the ground. The oval is serviced by West Footscray railway station and local bus lines.

High School, Matunga (Mumbai) is one of Mumbai's oldest and premier educational institutions. It is a co-educational English medium school, affiliated to Maharashtra Secondary School Certificate (SSC) Board, reputed for its high academic service, discipline and efficient management. The school is recognized by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai for primary education and Government of Maharashtra (and follows the SSC syllabus). The institution caters to the educational needs of all students irrespective of caste, creed or religion right from the Pre-Primary level to the Secondary level. History In a meeting of the South Indian Association on 27 December 1931, it was resolved to form a body called the South Indian Education Society to work for the cause of the education of children in Mumbai and its suburbs. The society was registered on 21 April 1932, and a Primary School was started with six students in a rented garage on 6 June 1932. The first principal of the school was P.V. Parameshwar Iyer. By the end of the first year the strength grew to 97 and the school moved to a larger premise. In the following years a plot of ground at the foot of the steps of King's Circle Station was acquired, and gradually the nucleus of the present large building of the High School was set up there and enlarged, and completed in March 1954, by which time it had 4200 students, and was one of the largest schools in the city. It is a co-educational English medium school, reputed for its high academic service, discipline and efficient management. The school is recognized by the Municipal Corporation and Government of Maharashtra (and follows the SSC syllabus). The institution caters to the educational needs of all students irrespective of caste, creed or religion right from the Pre-Primary level to the Secondary level. The Pre-Primary section presently houses 500 students, has adopted the Shishu Pahel methodology, a child motivational programme to impart quality education. The Primary sections, which has a strength of 1339 students is governed by the rules and regulations of the BMC (Private Primary Schools). It strictly follows the Grant-in-Code Book which lays down the statutory requirements. The school is affordable by the poorest students with minimal yearly fees, and free education for girls up to the fifth standard (grade). The school is located close to the King's Circle railway station and is thus accessible by walk to people living in Matunga, Wadala, Sion, Dadar and C.G.S. colony (Antop Hill). Extra-curricular activities The Pre- Primary Section of the school, which follows the Shishu Pahel Methodology plans various programmes like festivals, competitions, field trips, thematic exhibitions and other activities to expose the tiny tots to our great unique Indian Culture. The School is proud to have reigning Champs at Zonal level and State levels who have won prizes every year in sports activities. School also celebrates days of national importance, with due reverence to kindle the fire of patriotism and to kindle the harmony and peace with great zeal and fervour. The Cultural Department organises a week-long cultural festival \\"Prerna\\" which is a conglomeration of all cultural events that are usually spread throughout the year. The following competitions are planned for this occasion; Carnatic Music, Mehendi, Light Music, Rangoli, Group Dance, Monologues, Group Singing, Fancy Dance, Ad-mad, Dramatisation and Mimicry. The Science club organises various educative programmes with the objective of infusing scientific fervour and a spirit of inquiry in the minds of children, while Art circles gives an opportunity for our students to find expression to their talents in painting, drawing, music and dance. For those with a flair for drawing, the art teachers organise special classes and coach students to participate in the Elementary and Intermediate Grade Examination conducted by the Maharashtra Govt. Competitions like 'best out of waste', 'rakhi making', 'greeting cards', 'salad decoration', 'flower arrangement' and 'rangoli' are also organised. Mission and vision SIES High School believes \\"education\\" to be helpful in the democratic reconstruction of the Indian society, and hence aims in training the students to be both, a good professional and a sober, rational and discriminating citizen. The management and the staff are determined to make every effort to deepen and broaden the concept of education by enlarging its scope, to include, along with formal instruction, many co-curricular activities and thus help to develop an integrated human personality of the students. Platinum Jubilee On 24 February 2008, the year of the Platinum Jubilee of the school, the batch of students that joined the school in its Silver Jubilee year‚Äî1958‚Äîand passed out in 1969, held their \\"golden reunion\\"‚Äîthe first reunion of its kind by any batch of the school.

This bipedal/quadrupedal, herbivorous dinosaur is known for its distinctive hollow cranial crest, which in the best- known species resembled a hatchet. Several possible species have been named, from Canada, the United States, and Mexico, but only the two Canadian species are currently recognized as valid. Material relevant to the genus was first named by Lawrence Lambe in 1902. Over twenty years later, the modern name was coined in 1923 by William Parks, in honour of Lambe, based on better preserved specimens. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, in part because small-bodied crested hadrosaurids now recognized as juveniles were once thought to belong to their own genera and species. Currently, the various skulls assigned to the type species L. lambei are interpreted as showing age differences and sexual dimorphism. Lambeosaurus was closely related to the better known Corythosaurus, which is found in slightly older rocks, as well as the less well-known genera Hypacrosaurus and Olorotitan. All had unusual crests, which are now generally assumed to have served social functions like noisemaking and recognition. History and species =Early discoveries and names= L. lambei skull being excavated in Alberta, Canada Lambeosaurus has a complicated taxonomic history, beginning in 1902 with Lawrence Lambe's naming of hadrosaurid limb material and other bones (originally GSC 419) from Alberta as Trachodon marginatus. In the same publication Trachodon altidens, a left upper jaw (GSC 1092) from the Dinosaur Park Formation was also described by Lambe. In the same volume, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested T. altidens could belong to a new genus, which he labelled \\"Didanodon\\" without further discussion. Paleontologists began finding better remains of hadrosaurids from the same rocks in the 1910s, in what is now known as the late Campanian-age (Upper Cretaceous) Dinosaur Park Formation. Lambe assigned two new skulls to T. marginatus, and based on the new information, coined the genus Stephanosaurus for the species in 1914. Unfortunately, there was very little to associate the skulls with the scrappy earlier marginatus material, so in 1923 William Parks proposed a new genus and species for the skulls, with both generic and specific names honoring Lambe (who had died four years earlier): Lambeosaurus lambei (type specimen NMC 2869, originally GSC 2869). In the same publication, this species was made the type genus of the new subfamily Lambeosaurinae, as a replacement for the pre-existed Stephanosaurinae. =Procheneosaurus and Tetragonosaurus= Type specimen of Procheneosaurus praeceps (AMNH 5340), American Museum of Natural History Although the early workers in Alberta did not recognize it at the time, they were finding the remains of juvenile Lambeosaurus as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested duckbills were interpreted as adults of a distinct lineage of hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae.Lull, pp. 178‚Äì187. In 1920, William Diller Matthew used the name Procheneosaurus (no species name) in a brief mention of a skeleton at the American Museum of Natural History, from the Dinosaur Park Formation (AMNH 5340). Parks believed that the procedure and description were inadequate for the name to be considered valid, and to address the situation, he coined the genus Tetragonosaurus. Into this genus he placed the type species T. praeceps (based on ROM 3577) and a second species T. erectofrons (based on ROM 3578) for small skulls from the Dinosaur Park Formation, and assigned Matthew's Procheneosaurus skeleton to T. praeceps. Charles M. Sternberg followed in 1935 by adding the slightly larger T. cranibrevis, based on GSC (now NMC) 8633. The use of Tetragonosaurus was rejected by Richard Swann Lull in favor of Procheneosaurus. Lull requested that the name Tetragonosaurus be suppressed in favor of Procheneosaurus, which was granted, and Procheneosaurus received official approval from the ICZN as a conserved name.ICZN Opinion #193 In 1942 he and Wright transferred the Tetragonosaurus species and, tentatively, Trachodon altidens, to Procheneosaurus, with P. praeceps serving as the type species.Lull, pp. 1‚Äì242. This usage was generally followed until 1975, when Peter Dodson proposed all three species were actually juveniles of Lambeosaurus. \\"Procheneosaurus\\" convincens, from the Late Cretaceous of Kazakhstan, is known from a nearly complete skeleton missing only the snout and end of the tail. It was named by A. K. Rozhdestvensky in 1968. It has at times been considered synonymous with Jaxartosaurus aralensis, or deserving of its own genus. Bell and Brink (2013) made \\"P.\\" convincens the type species of the new genus Kazaklambia. =Other discoveries= Skeletons of L. lambei (front) and L. magnicristatus, Royal Tyrrell Museum The \\"cheneosaurines\\" weren't the only crested duckbills being studied and named in the early 1900s. It was then the accepted practice to name genera and species for what is now seen as more likely individual variation, variation due to age or sex, or distortion from fossilization. Three more species were named during this period that relate to Lambeosaurus, all in 1935. Sternberg, in the same paper as T. cranibrevis, named a skull and partial skeleton (GSC-8705, now NMC‚Äî8705) L. magnicristatum (corrected in 1937 to magnicristatus), and a smaller skull (GSC‚Äî8705, now NMC‚Äî8703) L. clavinitialis, with a less prominent crest and reduced spine pointing from the back. Parks contributed Corythosaurus frontalis, based on skull GSC 5853 (now ROM 869), which differed from the well-known tall, straight, rounded crest of other specimens of Corythosaurus by having a low crest cocked forward. New specimens were not described for many years following the activity of the early 1900s. In 1964 John Ostrom noted that an old species named by Othniel Charles Marsh, Hadrosaurus paucidens, based on USNM 5457, a partial maxilla and squamosal from the Judith River Formation of Fergus County, Montana, was probably a specimen of Lambeosaurus. =Dodson's two species model to present= Profiles of various specimens, once assigned to their own species, now interpreted as different growth stages and sexes of L. lambei In 1975, Peter Dodson, examining why there should be so many species and genera of lambeosaurine duckbills within such a short geological time frame and small area, published the results of a morphometric study in which he measured dozens of skulls. He found that many of the species had been based on remains that were better interpreted as juveniles or different sexes, something touched on but largely ignored in older literature. For Lambeosaurus, he found that L. clavinitialis was probably the female of L. lambei, and Corythosaurus frontalis and Procheneosaurus praeceps were probably its juveniles. L. magnicristatus was different enough to warrant its own species. He interpreted Procheneosaurus cranibrevis and P. erectofrons as juvenile corythosaurs. However, restudy of the Procheneosaurus/Tetragonosaurus remains indicates that within species, assignments had become confused, and the type specimen of P. cranibrevis was a Lambeosaurus juvenile, whereas others were Corythosaurus, based on the distinctive form of the contact of the nasal bone with the premaxilla. Dodson's model would become widely accepted, and two species of Lambeosaurus are regularly recognized today, with a third sometimes accepted. L. lambei (Parks, 1923) is known from at least 17 individuals, with seven skulls and partial skeletons and around ten isolated skulls. L. clavinitialis (C.M. Sternberg, 1935), Corythosaurus frontalis (Parks, 1935), and Procheneosaurus praeceps (Parks, 1931) are all still regarded as synonyms of L. lambei in recent reviews. Some palaeontologists suggest that L. clavinitialis skulls without the backward spine may represent L. magnicristatus individuals instead,; this was rejected in the 2007 redescription of L. magnicristatus. The second species, L. magnicristatus (C.M. Sternberg, 1935) is only definitely known from two specimens, both with skulls. Unfortunately, the majority of the articulated skeleton of the type specimen has been lost. Many of the bones were extensively damaged by water while in storage and were discarded before description; other portions of this skeleton have also been lost. Its remains come from slightly younger rocks than L. lambei. The specific name is derived from the Latin magnus \\"large\\" and cristatus \\"crested\\", referring to its bony crest. Additionally, Jack Horner has identified fragmentary lambeosaurine jaws from the Bearpaw Formation of Montana as possibly belonging to L. magnicristatus; these represent the first lambeosaurine remains from marine rocks. Left premaxilla of the holotype specimen of Magnapaulia laticaudus Other less accepted species have been discussed in the 21st century. Lambeosaurus paucidens (named by Marsh 1889 and referred to Lambeosaurus in 1964) is generally regarded as a dubious name and was listed as Hadrosaurus paucidens in a 2004 review, although at least one author, Donald F. Glut, has accepted it as a species of Lambeosaurus. In this case, the specific epithet is derived from the Latin pauci- \\"few\\" and dens \\"tooth\\". The irregularities of Procheneosaurus cranibrevis, and the identity of the type as a juvenile lambeosaur, were recognized in 2005. Finally, \\"Didanodon altidens\\" has been assigned without comment to Lambeosaurus in two 21st Century reviews.Lund, E.K. and Gates, T.A. (2006). \\"A historical and biogeographical examination of hadrosaurian dinosaurs.\\" pp. 263 in Lucas, S.G. and Sullivan, R.M. (eds.), Late Cretaceous vertebrates from the Western Interior. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 35. During the late 1970s, Bill Morris was studying giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them L.? laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used a question mark in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, as well as a healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia. Description L. lambei compared to a human Lambeosaurus, best known through L. lambei, was quite similar to Corythosaurus in everything but the form of the head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, the crest of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were at the front of the crest and stacked vertically. It also can be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making up part of the sides of the crest, which is the only way to tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged. Lambeosaurus was like other hadrosaurids, and could move on both two legs and all fours, as shown by footprints of related animals. It had a long tail stiffened by ossified tendons that prevented it from drooping. The hands had four fingers, lacking the innermost finger of the generalized five-fingered tetrapod hand, while the second, third, and fourth fingers were bunched together and bore hooves, suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support. The fifth finger was free and could be used to manipulate objects. Each foot had only the three central toes. The most distinctive feature, the crest, was different in the two well-known species. In L. lambei, it had a hatchet-like shape when the dinosaur was full-grown, and was somewhat shorter and more rounded in specimens interpreted as females. The \\"hatchet blade\\" projected in front of the eyes, and the \\"handle\\" was a solid bony rod that jutted out over the back of the skull. The \\"hatchet blade\\" had two sections: the uppermost portion was a thin bony \\"coxcomb\\" that grew out relatively late in life, when an individual neared adulthood; and the lower portion held hollow spaces that were continuations of the nasal passages. In L. magnicristatus, the \\"handle\\" was greatly reduced, and the \\"blade\\" expanded,Lull, pp. 193‚Äì194. forming a tall, exaggerated pompadour-like crest. This crest is damaged in the best overall specimen, and only the front half remains. The Canadian species of Lambeosaurus appear to have been similar in size to Corythosaurus, and thus around long.Lull, pp. 227‚Äì228. Impressions of the scales are known for several specimens; a specimen now assigned to L. lambei had a thin skin with uniform, polygonal scutes distributed in no particular order on the neck, torso, and tail.Lull, pp. 112‚Äì117. Similar scalation is known from the neck, forelimb, and foot of a specimen of L. magnicristatus. Classification Lambeosaurus is the type genus of the Lambeosaurinae, the subfamily of hadrosaurids that had hollow skull crests. Among the lambeosaurines, it is closely related to similar dinosaurs such as Corythosaurus and Hypacrosaurus, with little separating them but crest form. The relationships among these dinosaur genera are difficult to pick out. Some early classifications placed these genera in the tribe Corythosaurini, which was found by David Evans and Robert Reisz to include Lambeosaurus as the sister taxon to a clade made up of Corythosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, and the Russian genus Olorotitan; these lambeosaurines, with Nipponosaurus. However, later researchers pointed out that due to the rules of priority set forth by the ICZN, any tribe containing Lambeosaurus is properly named Lambeosaurini, and that therefore the name \\"Corythosaurini\\" is a junior synonym. The following cladogram illustrating the relationships of Lambeosaurus and its close relatives was recovered in a 2012 phylogenetic analysis by Albert Prieto-M√°rquez, Luis M. Chiappe and Shantanu H. Joshi. A life restoration of tall-crested L. magnicristatus Specimen of related genus Corythosaurus Paleobiology =Feeding= Skull of an adult, AMNH As a hadrosaurid, Lambeosaurus was a large bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore, eating plants with a sophisticated skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to mammalian chewing. Its teeth were continually replaced and were packed into dental batteries that each contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. It used its beak to crop plant material, which was held in the jaws by a cheek-like organ. Feeding would have been from the ground up to around above. As noted by Bob Bakker, lambeosaurines have narrower beaks than hadrosaurines, implying that Lambeosaurus and its relatives could feed more selectively than their broad-beaked, crestless counterparts. =Cranial crest= Skull of a juvenile with a small crest Like other lambeosaurines such as Parasaurolophus and Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus had a distinctive crest on the top of its head. Its nasal cavity ran back through this crest, making it mostly hollow. Many suggestions have been made for the function or functions of the crest, including housing salt glands, improving the sense of smell, use as a snorkel or air trap, acting as a resonating chamber for making sounds, or being a method for different species or different sexes of the same species to recognize each other. Social functions such as noisemaking and recognition have become the most widely accepted of the various hypotheses. The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. The hadrosaurid sense of hearing also appears to be strong. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear, and the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's. This indicates that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. If used as a noisemaker, the crest could also have provided recognizable differences for different species or sexes, because the differing layouts of the nasal passages corresponding to the different crest shapes would have produced intrinsically different sounds. Paleoecology Megafaunal dinosaurs of the Dinosaur Park Formation, L lambei second from left Lambeosaurus lambei and L. magnicristatus, from the Dinosaur Park Formation, were members of a diverse and well-documented fauna of prehistoric animals that included such well-known dinosaurs as the horned Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Chasmosaurus, fellow duckbills Prosaurolophus, Gryposaurus, Corythosaurus, and Parasaurolophus, tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus, and armored Edmontonia and Euoplocephalus.Weishampel, David B.; Barrett, Paul M.; Coria, Rodolfo A.; Le Loeuff, Jean; Xu Xing; Zhao Xijin; Sahni, Ashok; Gomani, Elizabeth, M.P.; and Noto, Christopher R. (2004). \\"Dinosaur Distribution\\", in The Dinosauria (2nd ed.). Berkeley: University of California Press. pp. 517‚Äì606. The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward.Eberth, David A. \\"The geology\\", in Dinosaur Provincial Park, pp. 54‚Äì82. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.Braman, Dennis R., and Koppelhus, Eva B. \\"Campanian palynomorphs\\", in Dinosaur Provincial Park, pp. 101‚Äì130. The anatomically similar L. lambei, L. magnicristatus, and Corythosaurus were separated by time within the formation, based on stratigraphy. Corythosaurus fossils are known from the lower two-thirds of the Formation, L. lambei fossils are present in the upper third, and L. magnicristatus remains are rare and present only at the very top, where the marine influence was greater.Ryan, Michael J. and Evans, David C. \\"Ornithischian Dinosaurs\\" in Dinosaur Provincial Park, pp. 312‚Äì348 See also * Timeline of hadrosaur research References Bibliography * * External links * * Lambeosaurus Paleobiology Database (technical) * Lambeosaurus Natural History Museum Category:Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of North America Category:Lambeosaurines Category:Fossil taxa described in 1923 Category:Taxa named by William Parks Category:Dinosaur Park fauna Category:Paleontology in Alberta Category:Campanian genus first appearances Category:Campanian genus extinctions ","title":"Lambeosaurus"},{"id":"2072341","text":"Chittorgarh (also Chittor or Chittaurgarh) is a major city in Rajasthan state of western India. It lies on the Berach River, a tributary of the Banas, and is the administrative headquarters of Chittorgarh District and a former capital of the Sisodia Rajput dynasty of Mewar. The city of Chittaurgarh is located on the banks of river Gambhiri and Berach. Chittorgarh is home to the Chittor Fort, the largest fort in India and Asia. It was the site of three major sieges (1303, 1535, and 1567‚Äì1568) by Muslim invaders, and its Hindu rulers fought fiercely to maintain their independence. On more than one occasion, when faced with a certain defeat, the men fought to death while the women committed suicide by jauhar (mass self-immolation). Chittor also has been a land of worship for Meera, It is also known for Panna Dai.  History  Originally called Chitrakuta, the Chittor Fort is said to have been built by Chitranga, a king of the maurya ( mori ) clan . The Guhila (Gahlot) ruler Bappa Rawal is said to have captured the fort in either 728 CE or 734 CE. However, some historians doubt the historicity of this legend, arguing that the Guhilas did not control Chittor before the reign of the later ruler Allata. In 1303, the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khilji defeated the Guhila king Ratnasingh, and captured the fort. The fort was later captured by Hammir Singh, a king of the Sisodia branch of the Guhilas. Chittor gained prominence during the period of his successors, which included Rana Kumbha and Rana Sanga. In 1535, Bahadur Shah of Gujarat besieged and conquered the fort. After he was driven away by the Mughal emperor Humayun, the fort was given back to Sisodias by him. In 1567‚Äì68, the Mughal emperor Akbar besieged and captured the fort and it was under Mughal control until the British Indian Empire.

History The Liberation War Museum began under the initiative of an eight- person board of trustees as a means of preserving the memory of the 1971 Liberation War. The trustees sought donations from the general public to fund the museum and for the general public to come forward with artifacts to be displayed artifacts from the war, including personal belongings, weapons and human remains, as well as creating an archive of documents and personal histories related to the war. Over the years the museum collected more than 21,000 artifacts (as of 2016), with some as exhibits on display in the museum and many more stored in its archives. The museum describes itself as \\"the outcome of a citizens' effort\\" due to the crowd-funded nature of the museum (which is independent of the Govt. of Bangladesh) and the collective contribution of the general public to the museum's collection. = Relocation = Due to a lack of space it was only possible to display a fraction of the collected artifacts at the original premises, so it was decided that a bigger, more modern premises was required. In 2009, an architectural contest was held for the new design of the museum, with architects Tanzim Hasan Salim and Naheed Farzana winning the first prize for their designs. In 2013 land was acquired in Agargaon for the new building and construction began. The new premises of the Liberation War Museum were officially opened on 16 April 2017. The new building provided much more space with 3500 square meters of gallery space.  Galleries  Mirpur is maintained by the museum.

Real life demonstration of refuge camps in India Note: These paragraphs relate specifically to the galleries of the older (pre-2017) premises. The galleries begin with coverage of the early history of Bangladesh and the Indian independence movement against British Raj in Bengal. A major section records the events of the Language Movement for the recognition of the Bengali language in Pakistan, which is regarded as the beginning of the movement for Bangladesh's independence. Several galleries highlight the building sectional conflict between West Pakistan and Bangladesh (then East Pakistan), the rise of Bengali nationalist leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the events of 1971, when the postponement by Pakistan's military ruler Gen. Yahya Khan of the convening of the National Assembly of Pakistan, in which Sheikh Mujib's Awami League had won a majority, led to the call for the independence of Bangladesh. The coverage of the liberation war includes the training and operations of the Mukti Bahini, the guerrilla army built by the Awami League to resist Pakistani forces. Several galleries focus on the genocide carried out by the Pakistani army against the Bengali population, with Operation Searchlight targeting Bengali intellectuals, students, Hindus and Awami League leaders, and the humanitarian crisis created with the pouring of an estimated ten million refugees into neighbouring India. The coverage of the war continues to India's support for the Mukti Bahini and its subsequent direct intervention with the outbreak of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, which led to the surrender of all Pakistani forces in Bangladesh on 16 December 1971. The galleries display the weapons used by the Mukti Bahini, personal effects of many Mukti Bahini fighters and civilian victims of the atrocities committed by Pakistani forces, many donated by their families after the conflict. Also displayed are remains of human skulls and bones retrieved from mass graves of civilians killed by Pakistani forces.  Activities  The museum is involved in a number of outreach and reachout programs. These includes programs working with schools to educate the youth about the Liberation War as well as regular conferences and seminars within the museum premises. The museum also supported for varied art and cultural events. Commissioned artworks and collaborated artist art projects. Under the patronage of the museum, it had several art exhibitions including a Photographic exhibition on the ‚ÄúLiberation War : Towards 25th Anniversary‚Äù held at ‚Äò La Galerie‚Äô in Dhaka[March, 1995], published a Photographic album containing 100 historic photographs portraying the Liberation struggle of Bangali people from the beginning (British Period) ending with the establishment of Bangladesh. The format of this album was such that it could be mounted anywhere for an exhibition [December, 1994], commissioned and collaborated (along with EMK center Dhaka) the war related art project of artist Firoz Mahmud's Sucker wfp21 project [March, 2016] among many others.  International links  In 2006 the museum was fitted with modern audiovisual and exhibition equipment as a donation from the Japanese government to help preserve the culture and heritage of Bangladesh's independence movement.

Mathematically, the Willmore energy of a smooth closed surface embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space is defined to be the integral of the square of the mean curvature minus the Gaussian curvature. It is named after the English geometer Thomas Willmore. Definition Expressed symbolically, the Willmore energy of S is: : \\\\mathcal{W} = \\\\int_S H^2 \\\\, dA - \\\\int_S K \\\\, dA where H is the mean curvature, K is the Gaussian curvature, and dA is the area form of S. For a closed surface, by the Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem, the integral of the Gaussian curvature may be computed in terms of the Euler characteristic \\\\chi(S) of the surface, so : \\\\int_S K \\\\, dA = 2 \\\\pi \\\\chi(S), which is a topological invariant and thus independent of the particular embedding in \\\\mathbb{R}^3 that was chosen. Thus the Willmore energy can be expressed as : \\\\mathcal{W} = \\\\int_S H^2 \\\\, dA - 2 \\\\pi \\\\chi(S) An alternative, but equivalent, formula is : \\\\mathcal{W} = {1 \\\\over 4} \\\\int_S (k_1 - k_2)^2 \\\\, dA where k_1 and k_2 are the principal curvatures of the surface. =Properties= The Willmore energy is always greater than or equal to zero. A round sphere has zero Willmore energy. The Willmore energy can be considered a functional on the space of embeddings of a given surface, in the sense of the calculus of variations, and one can vary the embedding of a surface, while leaving it topologically unaltered. Critical points A basic problem in the calculus of variations is to find the critical points and minima of a functional. For a given topological space, this is equivalent to finding the critical points of the function :\\\\int_S H^2 \\\\, dA since the Euler characteristic is constant. One can find (local) minima for the Willmore energy by gradient descent, which in this context is called Willmore flow. For embeddings of the sphere in 3-space, the critical points have been classified:. they are all conformal transforms of minimal surfaces, the round sphere is the minimum, and all other critical values are integers greater than or equal to 4\\\\pi. They are called Willmore surfaces. Willmore flow The Willmore flow is the geometric flow corresponding to the Willmore energy; it is an L^2-gradient flow. :e[{\\\\mathcal{M}}]=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_{\\\\mathcal{M}} H^2\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}A where H stands for the mean curvature of the manifold \\\\mathcal{M}. Flow lines satisfy the differential equation: : \\\\partial_t x(t) = - abla \\\\mathcal{W}[x(t)] \\\\, where x is a point belonging to the surface. This flow leads to an evolution problem in differential geometry: the surface \\\\mathcal{M} is evolving in time to follow variations of steepest descent of the energy. Like surface diffusion it is a fourth-order flow, since the variation of the energy contains fourth derivatives. Applications * Cell membranes tend to position themselves so as to minimize Willmore energy. * Willmore energy is used in constructing a class of optimal sphere eversions, the minimax eversions.

The plant possesses very small yellow or pink flowers and an inflated stem just below branching segments. Eriogonum: from the Greek erion, \\"wool\\", and gonu, \\"joint or knee\\", in reference to the hairy or woolly joints of some of the species of the genus, but not particularly inflatum. It is found in the Mojave Desert and other deserts. Stems The swelling of the stems was assumed to have been influenced by the presence of gall insects, most notably of the genus Odynerus. The female wasp produces a small hole on the inflated portion of the desert trumpet, packs the cavity with larvae and lays her eggs upon them, providing a food source, and a protected environment for the offspring. Irritation caused by this process was said to have enlarged the cavity over time. Recently, research performed by a world authority on the genus Eriogonum, Dr. J. L. Reveal of the University of Maryland, College Park, revealed the swollen stem of Eriogonum inflatum is due to high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the solid stem and seems to be related to gas regulation. Some insects utilize the swollen stem as a larder, but the inflation is not caused by the larval feeding of gall insects. Closeup of the flower Fall colors Uses It is known that some Native American tribes that once inhabited the surrounding areas of the Las Vegas Valley (most commonly Paiute) would remove the stalk of E. inflatum at the base, and then cut the inflated bulb in half, producing a makeshift pipe.

The club later changed its name to Kolbotn Idrettsklubb (KIK). Kolbotn Arbeideridrettslag (Kolbotn AIL) was founded in 1924. In 1934 the speedskaters broke away from KIK and started Kolbotn Sk√∏yteklubb with Wilhelm Berthelsen as chairman. In 1946 the three clubs, Kolbotn Idrettsklubb, Kolbotn Arbeideridrettslag, and Kolbotn Sk√∏yteklubb merged and took the new name Kolbotn Idrettslag (aka Kolbotn I.L.). In 1985, Hellerasten Volleyball Klubb was included in Kolbotn I.L. In 1925 Roald Amundsen, the famous polar explorer, was appointed honorable member of the club. The club is probably best known for its eminent wrestlers. Kolbotn wrestlers had a very good period in the 1940s and again in the early 1980s to the mid-1990s. The most notable results were two Olympic gold medals by Jon R√∏nningen. Kolbotn I.L. started Handball in 1940 and the Handball section had its golden years in the early 1980s as they won the National league in 1983 and 1984. Kolbotn Volleyball won the National league in 1984 (as Hellerasten), and 1986. In 1992, Kolbotn Volleyball won both the National league and the National championship. Kolbotn Football has had a very capable women‚Äôs team, in the last several years winning the elite Toppserien league in 2002, 2005, and 2006 and the national Cup championship in 2007. In 2009 Dan Eggen, former Norwegian international player, joined as the team's chief trainer.

Their English name derives from the mediaeval belief that hawks ate the plant to improve their eyesight. Although originally only native to Eurasia and North Africa, some species have since become established in other countries, including the United States and New Zealand. Recent research has shown that the genus Leontodon in the traditional delimitation is polyphyletic. Therefore, the former Leontodon subgenus Oporinia was raised to generic level. According to the nomenclatural rules the name Scorzoneroides has priority at generic level and therefore, the members of Leontodon subgenus Oporinia were transferred to the re-erected genus Scorzoneroides. Ecology Seeds of Leontodon species are an important food source for certain bird species. Uses In Crete, the species Leontodon tuberosus which is called ('), (') or (') has its roots eaten raw and its leaves eaten steamed.  Secondary metabolites  The genus Leontodon s.str. (i.e. excluding the members of the resurrected genus Scorzoneroides) is a rich source of hypocretenolides, unique guaiane type sesquiterpene lactones with a 12,5-lactone ring instead of the usual 12,6 lactone ring.

This custom was linked with others, such as that of the Feast of Fools and the Feast of Asses. History canons In England the boy bishop was elected on 6 December, the feast of Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of children, and his authority lasted till Holy Innocents' day (28 December). The real Bishop would, symbolically, step down at the deposuit potentes de sede of the Magnificat (\\"he hath put down the mighty from their seat\\"), and the boy would take his seat at et exaltavit humiles (\\"and hath exalted the humble and meek\\"). After the election, the boy was dressed in full bishop's robes with mitre and crozier and, attended by other boys dressed as priests, made a circuit of the town blessing the people. Typically the chosen boy and his comrades took possession of the cathedral and performed all the ceremonies and offices, except Mass. Originally, it seems, confined to the cathedrals, the custom spread to many parishes. Notwithstanding the intervention of various Church authorities (see Feast of Fools), the popularity of the custom made it resilient. In England it was abolished by Henry VIII in 1542, revived by Mary I in 1552 and finally abolished by Elizabeth I. On the continent of Europe it survived for quite some time in Germany, in the so-called , said to have been founded by Gregory IV. It is still practiced in some cities in Spain. The custom has given rise to some popular misconceptions, however, one of which is the traditional misidentification of a miniature episcopal tomb effigy in Salisbury Cathedral as a boy bishop: this is more likely to commemorate a secondary burial (heart or viscera) of a real bishop, possibly Richard Poore. Revivals There have been some recent revivals both in the English-speaking world and on the continent. Most famous perhaps is that of Hereford, revived in 1973 for a special children's service, with full and traditional ceremonies following annually since 1982. The Boy Bishop preaches a sermon and leads prayers at various Diocesan Advent services. A single revival took place in 1959 at St George's Parish Church, Stockport. Such ceremonies are now also found at Westminster Cathedral, Salisbury Cathedral, and a number of parish churches throughout England, including All Saints' Church, Northampton, Claines, Worcestershire, and also St Christopher's Parish Church, Bournemouth, (early 1950s), where the Boy Bishop was installed on St Christopher's Day, (July 25), and 'reigned' for one year, preaching and 'presiding' at youth events. The market town of Alcester, Warwickshire has its very own St Nicholas night complete with the Boy Bishop on 6 December each year. The custom was likewise revived in Burgos, Spain, where the boy-bishop feast had been extremely popular before the cathedral choir was closed in the 1930s. After its re- establishment, the boy bishop was revived in 1987, and has since been celebrated every year.Validivieso Arce, Jaime L. (1998). ¬´La antigua fiesta infantil del Obispillo en Burgos¬ª.

The festival was also revived in Chavagnes International College, a Catholic boarding school in France. In the United States, one of the first adoptions of the custom took place in 1979 at the Cathedral of All Saints (Episcopal) in Albany, New York, as part of an annual medieval fair held in the great Gothic- revival style church. In December 2009, a teenage girl from Wellingborough, England was appointed Britain's first girl bishop at All Saints' Church in the town. Further reading =Recent works= *A.

It is the central city of Romagna. The city is situated along the Via Emilia, to the right of the Montone river, and is an important agricultural centre. The city hosts some of Italy's culturally and artistically significant landmarks; it is also notable as the birthplace of painters Melozzo da Forl√¨ and Marco Palmezzano, humanist historian Flavio Biondo, physicians Geronimo Mercuriali and Giovanni Battista Morgagni. The University Campus of Forl√¨ (part of the University of Bologna) is specialized in Economics, Engineering, Political Sciences as well as the Advanced school of Modern Languages for Interpreters and Translators (SSLMIT).  Climate  The climate of the area is humid subtropical (Cfa in the K√∂ppen climate classification) with Mediterranean features, fairly mitigated by the relative closeness of the city to the sea. Forl√¨ is characterized by hot and sunny summers, with temperatures that can exceed and even reach during the hottest weeks of the year. Winters are cool and moist, with frequent fog. Occasionally the warm Sirocco wind blows from the south, bringing warmer temperatures for brief periods.  History  = Ancient era = The surroundings of Forl√¨ have been inhabited since the Paleolithic: a site, Ca' Belvedere of Monte Poggiolo, has revealed thousands of chipped flints in strata dated 800,000 years before the present era, which indicates a flint-knapping industry producing sharp-edged tools in a pre- Acheulean phase of the Paleolithic. Forl√¨ was founded after the Roman conquest of the remaining Gallic villages, about the time the Via Aemilia was built. With no clear evidence, the exact date this occurred is still under debate, though some historians believe that the first settlement of the ancient Roman Forum was built in approximately 188 BC by consul Gaius Livius Salinator (the same that fought Hasdrubal Barca and vanquished him at the banks of the Metaurus River in 207 BC), who gave it the Latin name Forum Livii, meaning \\"the place of the gens Livia\\". Others argue the town may have been founded later, during the time of Julius Caesar. In 88 BC, the city was destroyed during the civil wars of Gaius Marius and Sulla, but later rebuilt by the praetor Livius Clodius. = Middle Ages = After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the city was incorporated into the realms of Odoacer and of the Ostrogothic Kingdom. From the end of the 6th century to 751, Forl√¨ was an outlying part of the Byzantine power in Italy known as the Exarchate of Ravenna. During this time the Germanic Lombards repeatedly took the city ‚Äì in 665, 728, and 742. It was finally incorporated with the Papal States in 757, as part of the Donation of Pepin. By the 9th century the commune had taken control from its bishops, and Forl√¨ was established as an independent Italian city-state, alongside the other communes that signalled the first revival of urban life in Italy. Forl√¨ became a republic for the first time in 889. At this time the city was allied with the Ghibelline factions in the medieval struggles between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, partly as a means of preserving its independence ‚Äì and the city supported all the Holy Roman Emperors in their campaigns in Italy. Local competition was involved in the loyalties: in 1241, during Frederick II's struggles with Pope Gregory IX the people of Forl√¨ offered their support to Frederick II during the capture of the rival city, Faenza, and in gratitude, they were granted an addition to their coat-of-arms -the Hohenstaufen eagle. With the collapse of Hohenstaufen power in 1257, imperial lieutenant Guido I da Montefeltro was forced to take refuge in Forl√¨, the only remaining Ghibelline stronghold in Italy. He accepted the position of capitano del popolo (\\"Captain of the People\\") and led Forl√¨ to notable victories: against the Bolognesi at the Ponte di San Proculo, on 15 June 1275;The Chronicle of Salimbene de Adam, translated by Joseph L. Biard (Binghamton: Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance Studies, 1986). Excerpted in against a Guelph allied force, including Florentine troops, at Civitella on 14 November 1276; and at Forl√¨ itself against a powerful French contingent sent by Pope Martin IV, on 15 May 1282, in a battle cited by Dante Alighieri (who was hosted in the city in 1303 by Scarpetta Ordelaffi), Inferno 27. In 1282, Forl√¨'s forces were led by Guido da Montefeltro, while the French were under Jean d'Eppe. The astrologer Guido Bonatti (advisor of Emperor Frederick II) was one of his advisors. The following year the city's exhausted Senate was forced to cede to papal power and asked Guido to take his leave. The commune soon submitted to a local condottiere rather than accept a representative of direct papal control, and Simone Mestaguerra had himself proclaimed Lord of Forl√¨. He did not succeed in leaving the new signory peacefully to an heir, however, and Forl√¨ passed to Maghinardo Pagano, then to Uguccione della Faggiuola (1297), and to others, until in 1302 the Ordelaffi came into power. Local factions with papal support ousted the family in 1327‚Äì29 and again in 1359‚Äì75, and at other turns of events the bishops were expelled by the Ordelaffi. Until the Renaissance the Ordelaffi strived to maintain the possession of the city and its countryside, especially against Papal attempts to assert back their authority. Often civil wars between members of the family occurred. They also fought as condottieri for other states to earn themselves money to protect or embellish Forl√¨. Porta Schiavonia. = Modern age = The most renowned of the Ordelaffi was Pino III, who held the Signiory of Forl√¨ from 1466 to 1480. Pino was a ruthless lord; nevertheless he enriched the city with new walls and buildings and was a sponsor of the arts. When he died aged 40, under suspicion of poisoning, the situation of Forl√¨ was weakened as factions of Ordelaffi fought one another, until Pope Sixtus IV claimed the signory for his nephew Girolamo Riario. Riario was married to Caterina Sforza, the indomitable Lady of Forl√¨ whose name is associated with the city's last independent history. Forl√¨ was seized in 1488 by the Visconti and in 1499 by Cesare Borgia, after whose death it became more directly subject to the pope than ever before (apart from a short- lived return of the Ordelaffi in 1503‚Äì1504).

In June 1796, during the French Revolution, Jacobin French troops entered the city ‚Äî with Napoleon arriving on 4 February 1797. The French General recruited local officials and soldiers, resulting in political turmoil between 1820 and 1830, with risings in 1821 ‚Äîincluding the revolutionary movement of the Carbonari in 1831 and 1848. Napol√©on Louis Bonaparte, Napoleon I's nephew who was involved with the Carbonari, died there in 1831. In the 19th century, Forl√¨ was part of the Italian unification (or \\"the Risorgimento\\"), a political and social movement that agglomerated the different states of the Italian Peninsula into the single state of Italy. The citizens of Forl√¨ were particularly inspired by military figure Giuseppe Garibaldi, who at this time was a commander. However, the city and its farmers had difficulty adapting to agrarian reform under the unification, thus lending rise to republican and socialist parties. Forl√¨ participated considerably during World War I, resulting in it being awarded the \\"\\" gold medal. Afterwards in the 1920s, Benito Mussolini became actively involved in the local politics, before becoming dictator of Italy ‚Äî a situation that remained for 20 years before the start of World War II. The war left the city with destroyed monuments and artistic losses, such as the , which included frescoes by Melozzo da Forl√¨. After the war, however, the city experienced a quick economic recovery, entering a new stage of democratic life.  Economy  Forl√¨ is a prosperous agricultural and industrial centre, with manufacture primarily focused on silk, rayon, clothing, machinery, metals, and household appliances. In the city also has seat the Ferretti Group, one of the most famous producers of yachts. Government  Main sights  Abbey of San Mercuriale Forl√¨ is the location of various buildings of architectural, artistic and historical significance, that include frescoes as part of their decorations. At the heart of the city sits the Piazza Aurelio Saffi, which includes a statue of Italian politician Aurelio Saffi ‚Äì who was an important figure in the radical republican current within the Risorgimento movement, headed by Giuseppe Mazzini in the 19th century. The Piazza Saffi also includes the Abbey of San Mercuriale (named after Saint Mercurialis, a bishop of the city who died in the 5th century), which is the main religious building in the city; and contains the famed Sepulchre of Barbara Manfredi. Also of note is the Dominican Church of San Giacomo Apostolo; better known as the Church of San Domenico ‚Äì a late medieval church built in the 13th century in the southern part of the town. Other medieval buildings include the Rocca di Ravaldino, a fortress enlarged in the 14th century by the Ordelaffi and Gil de Albornoz, and later in the 15th century. The city hosts the Palazzo Hercolani, with decorations dating from the 19th century; containing the artwork La Beata Vergine del Fuoco con i Santi Mercuriale, Pellegrino, Marcolino e Valeriano by Italian painter . The is a civic building which was frescoed by Adolfo de Carolis in the 20th century.

The Teatro Diego Fabbri is a theatre which opened in September 2000.  People  The most well-known painter of the comune was Melozzo da Forl√¨, who worked in Rome and other Italian cities during the brief years of the High Renaissance. Other Forlivese painters were: Ansuino da Forl√¨, Marco Palmezzano, Francesco Menzocchi, and Livio Agresti. Together, they formed the Forl√¨ painting school.

It is located along the Lech, between Landsberg am Lech and F√ºssen. It has about 12,000 inhabitants. Schongau has a well-preserved old wall around the center.  Local history  The origin of Schongau is the current Altenstadt (lit.: old town). A large number of the inhabitants moved only a few kilometres into a new settlement founded on the Lech and took the name Schongau with them in the 13th century. The hillside was far better situated to defend it. The town of Schongau is located very close to the former Roman road to Augsburg, Via Claudia Augusta (47 AD) and has its name from the Romans. In the Middle Ages, it was an important hub and an commercial centre on route Verona-Augsburg-Nuremberg and at salt road from Berchtesgadener Land into the Allg√§u. Lechrain, populated by the Alemanni, was under the rule of the Swabian Welfs until the 12 century. After the death of Welf VI in 1191, the Welf territories in Swabia changed in to the hands to the Hohenstaufen. Emperor Frederick Barbarossa gave it to the Hohenstaufen. When the last Staufer ruler Conradin had moved to Italy in 1267 to defend his power against Charles of Anjou, his ally Duke Ludwig II of Bavaria unexpectedly denied his help and demanded the payment of debts, which is why Konradin had to give away a large part of his possessions as the Duke of Swabia (called the Konradinian donation).Jan Puhl: Tod durch das Schwert.

Christophstrasse is named after him in the historic centre of the town. On 22 May 1493, a devastating fire destroyed large parts of the Oberstadt (upper town) and the ducal palace; it was not until 1514 that reconstruction was completed. Schongau was involved several times in martial conflicts and was often a transit camp of friendly and hostile troops. Through trade and the diligence of its citizens, Schongau experienced a period of prosperity until the time of the discovery of America, which resulted in relocation of the great trade routes. As a result, the city became so poor that significant buildings such as the castle and the balehouse were partially decayed or demolished. After the Second World War, the city and the surrounding area gained a considerable number of residents due to refugees and developed into a district with relatively low unemployment due to the prosperous middle class. The city had the first railroad connection with the railway line Landsberg am Lech to Schongau on 16 November 1886. The railway connection in the direction of Weilheim was opened on January 12, 1917, by the section from Peissenberg to Schongau on the railway line Weilheim-Schongau. The railway line Kaufbeuren- Schongau existed from 1923 to 1977, it was built because of mining in Peiting. Schongau used to be a county of the same name. Due to the Bavarian district reform in 1972, it merged with the Weilheim district into today's Weilheim- Schongau county. In the town are still some institutions from the county authority, and the name Altlandkreis Schongau (lit.: old county Schongau) is still occasionally used.

It was built some time between 723 and 743, by Walid Ibn Yazid, the future Umayyad caliph Walid II, whose dominance of the region was rising at the time. It is considered one of the most important examples of early Islamic art and architecture. The building is actually the remnant of a larger complex that included an actual castle, meant as a royal retreat, without any military function, of which only the foundation remains. What stands today is a small country cabin. It is most notable for the frescoes that remain mainly on the ceilings inside, which depict, among others, a group of rulers, hunting scenes, dancing scenes containing naked women, working craftsmen, the recently discovered \\"cycle of Jonah\\", and, above one bath chamber, the first known representation of heaven on a hemispherical surface, where the mirror-image of the constellations is accompanied by the figures of the zodiac.

That status, and its location along Jordan's major east‚Äìwest highway, relatively close to Amman, have made it a frequent tourist destination. Location and access Qasr Amra is on the north side of Jordan's Highway 40, roughly from Amman and southwest of Al-Azraq. It is currently within a large area fenced off in barbed wire. An unpaved parking lot is located at the southeast corner, just off the road. A small visitor's center collects admission fees. The castle is located in the west of the enclosed area, below a small rise. South (rear) view, from highway Description Traces of stone walls used to enclose the site suggest it was part of a complex; there are remains of a castle which could have temporarily housed a garrison of soldiers. Just to the southeast of the building is a well deep, and traces of the animal-driven lifting mechanism and a dam have been found as well. The architecture of the reception-hall-cum-bathhouse is identical to that of Hammam al-Sarah, also in Jordan, except the latter was erected using finely-cut limestone ashlars (based on the Late Roman architectural tradition), while Amra's bath was erected using rough masonry held together by gypsum-lime mortar (based on the Sasanian architectural tradition). It is a low building made from limestone and basalt. The northern block, two stories high, features a triple-vaulted ceiling over the main entrance on the east facade. The western wings feature smaller vaults or domes. Today, Qasr Amra is in a poorer condition than the other desert castles such as Qasr Kharana, with graffiti damaging some frescoes. However, conservation work is underway supported by World Monuments Fund, the Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro, and Jordan's Department of Antiquities. History =Construction: who and when= One of the six kings depicted is King Roderick of Spain, whose short reign (710-712) was taken to indicate the date of the image, and possibly the building, to around 710. Therefore, for a long time researchers believed that sitting caliph Walid I was the builder and primary user of Qasr Amra, until doubts arose, making specialists believe that one of two princes who later became caliph themselves, Walid or Yazid, were the more likely candidates for that role. The discovery of an inscription during work in 2012 has allowed for the dating of the structure to the two decades between 723 and 743, when it was commissioned by Walid Ibn Yazid, crown prince under caliph Hisham and his successor during a short reign as caliph in 743-744. Both princes spent long periods of time away from Damascus, the Umayyad capital, before assuming the throne. Walid was known to indulge in the sort of sybaritic activities depicted on the frescoes, particularly sitting on the edge of pools listening to music or poetry. He was once entertained by performers dressed as stars and constellations, suggesting a connection to the sky painting in the caldarium. Yazid's mother was a Persian princess, suggesting a familiarity with that culture, and he too was known for similar pleasure-seeking. A key considerations in the placement of the desert castles centered on access and proximity to the ancient routes running north from Arabia to Syria. A major route ran from the Arabian city of Tayma via Wadi Sirhan toward the plain of Balqa in Jordan and accounts for the location of Qusayr Amra and other similar fortifications such as Qasr Al-Kharanah and Qasr al-tuba. =Rediscovery in 1898= The abandoned structure was re-discovered by Alois Musil in 1898, with the frescoes made famous in drawings by the Austrian artist Alphons Leopold Mielich for Musil's book. In the late 1970s a Spanish team restored the frescoes. The castle was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985 under criteria i), iii), and iv) (\\"masterpiece of human creative genius\\", \\"unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition\\" and \\"an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates a significant stage in human history\\"). Frescoes Al Walid II Fresco of a bathing woman Fresco of \\"Six kings\\", one of the most well known frescoes in Qasr Amra Constellations and zodiac painted on the dome of the caldarium Qasr Amra is most notable for the frescoes on the inside walls. =Reception hall= The main entry vault has scenes of hunting, fruit and wine consumption, and naked women. Some of the animals shown are not abundant in the region but were more commonly found in Persia, suggesting some influence from that area. One surface depicts the construction of the building. Near the base of one wall a haloed king is shown on a throne. An adjoining section, now in Berlin's Pergamon Museum, shows attendants as well as a boat in waters abundant with fish and fowl. =Throne apse= An image known as the \\"six kings\\" depicts the Umayyad caliph and the rulers of realms near and far. Based on details and inscriptions in the image, four of the depicted kings are identified as the Byzantine Emperor, the Visigothic king Roderic, the Sassanid Persian Shah, and the Negus of Ethiopia. The last one was for a long time unidentified, speculated to be the Turkish, Chinese, or Indian ruler, and now known to represent the emperor of China. Its intent was unclear. The Greek word ŒùŒôŒöŒó nike, meaning victory, was discovered nearby, suggesting that the \\"six kings\\" image was meant to suggest the caliph's supremacy over his enemies. Another possible interpretation is that the six figures are depicted in supplication, presumably towards the Caliph who would be seated in the hall. =Bath= The frescoes in all rooms but the caldarium reflect the advice of contemporary Arab physicians. They believed that baths drained the spirits of the bathers, and that to revive \\"the three vital principles in the body, the animal, the spiritual and the natural,\\" the bath's walls should be covered with pictures of activities like hunting, of lovers, and of gardens and palm trees. Apodyterium The apodyterium, or changing room, is decorated with scenes of animals engaging in human activities, particularly performing music. One ambiguous image has an angel gazing down on a shrouded human form. It has often been thought to be a death scene, but some other interpretations have suggested the shroud covers a pair of lovers. Three blackened faces on the ceiling have been thought to represent the stages of life. Christians in the area believe the middle figure is Jesus Christ. Tepidarium On the walls and ceiling of the tepidarium, or warm bath, are scenes of plants and trees similar to those in the mosaic at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. They are interspersed with naked females in various poses, some bathing a child. Caldarium The caldarium or hot bath's hemispheric dome has a representation of the heavens in which the zodiac is depicted, among 35 separate identifiable constellations. It is believed to be the earliest image of the night sky painted on anything other than a flat surface. The radii emerge not from the dome's center but, accurately, from the north celestial pole. The angle of the zodiac is depicted accurately as well. The only error discernible in the surviving artwork is the counterclockwise order of the stars, which suggests the image was copied from one on a flat surface.

While his work is humorous and universal in appeal, he also often deals with political, social, and racial issues.  Biography and personal life  Knight was born in Malden, Massachusetts, and raised in the Boston area. Previously a resident of San Francisco, in 2007 he moved to Los Angeles. He is now based in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. He is married to German-born illustrator Kerstin Konietzka-Knight, and they have two children; they appear as characters in The K Chronicles and The Knight Life. (The timeline of The Knight Life is about two years behind The K Chronicles.) Knight often pokes gentle fun at his wife's mangling of English idioms. Their first son is not referred to by name, but is sometimes referred to as \\"The Unbearable Cuteness of Being.\\"  Career  Knight's regular feature The K Chronicles, launched in the early 1990s, appears in various outlets, including Daily Kos, and previously appeared in the San Francisco Examiner, while (th)ink is published on several newspapers and websites, especially African- American sites. A syndicated daily strip, The Knight Life, was launched in 2008. Knight is also the artist for two strips appearing in Mad: Father O'Flannity's Hot Tub Confessions and Bully Baby. In the March 14, 2012, strip of The K Chronicles, Knight announced he was working on a graphic novel about his brief (1984‚Äì1985) career as a professional Michael Jackson impersonator. The book will be entitled I Was a Teenage Michael Jackson Impersonator. Knight also appeared in The Marginal Prophets, a hip-hop band. Knight has become a public speaker, with comic strip slideshows addressing racial illiteracy, police brutality and the role it has played since the early years of the United States. In November 2018 it was announced that Hulu would be producing a half-hour sitcom, titled Woke, based on The K Chronicles and events from Knight's life. The show will be co-written by Knight; actor Lamorne Morris will be playing Knight.  Awards  In 2007, The K Chronicles won the Harvey Kurtzman Award for Best Syndicated Comic Strip. The other nominees were Antiques: The Comic Strip, Doonesbury, Maakies, and Mutts. The K Chronicles has won the Glyph Awards Best Comic Strip multiple times, including 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010. In 2010, Knight was presented with an Inkpot Award for career achievement at the San Diego Comic-Con.

The formal, as well as pre- war, name of the synagogue is Khevre Loymdei Mishnayos (English translation: Association of Those Who Study Mishna). It is now part of the Auschwitz Jewish Center, which includes a Jewish Museum, a cafe in the house of Syzmon Kleuger and an education center. Background The O≈õwiƒôcim synagogue was the first building restored to the Jewish community under the Polish government‚Äôs post- Communism law governing the restitution of Jewish communal property seized by German occupiers during World War II, and retained by the post-war Communist government. The building was claimed by, and is now owned by, the Jewish community of nearby Bielsko-Bia≈Ça. History Interior of the O≈õwiƒôcim Synagogue The synagogue was built circa 1913. During World War II, the Nazis demolished its interior and used the building as a munitions depot. After the end of war, a small group of Jewish survivors restored the synagogue to its proper function. However, the custodians soon left Poland and the synagogue ceased to operate.The Chevra Lomdei Mishnayot Synagogue history; at ajcf.org In the 1970s, under communist Poland, the empty building was used as a carpet warehouse. The synagogue reopened on September 11, 2000, completely restored to its pre-war condition by the Auschwitz Jewish Center Foundation of New York, at the cost of one million dollars. It is an active synagogue used for prayers by groups and individuals visiting Auschwitz. The adjoining house was purchased by the foundation and turned into a contemporary museum called the Auschwitz Jewish Center (≈ªydowskie Centrum Edukacyjne). It depicts the life of Jews in pre-war O≈õwiƒôcim. Both the synagogue and the Jewish center are affiliated with the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York.Museum of Jewish Heritage ; at www.mjhnyc.org Presently at the Synagogue, there is an Auschwitz Jewish Center, a museum and a cultural center, focused on Jewish heritage, reconciliation through art and intercultural dialogue. Szymon Kluger's house The house of Szymon Kluger forms part of the complex that includes the synagogue. It now houses a cafe. The last native Jew of O≈õwiƒôcim died in 2000. His death in 2000 brought to an end the old Jewish community of O≈õwiƒôcim. The great synagogue At the time of the Nazi invasion, more than half the population of O≈õwiƒôcim was Jewish. The community was over 400 years old and there were then more than 20 synagogues in the city. Video presentation; at ajcf.org The Auschwitz synagogue was not the most important synagogue in O≈õwiƒôcim. The better known and bigger Great Synagogue of O≈õwiƒôcim was destroyed by the Nazis on November 29, 1939, and its remains were demolished.

Unlike the Compact Cassette, also designed by Philips, and the later Microcassette, introduced by Olympus, the Mini-Cassette does not use a capstan drive system; instead, the tape is propelled past the tape head by the reels.Microcassette Minicassette This is mechanically simple and allows the cassette to be made smaller and easier to use, but produces a system unsuited to any task other than voice recording, as the tape speed is not constant (averaging 2.4 cm/s) and prone to wow and flutter. However, the lack of a capstan and a pinch roller drive means that the tape is well-suited to being repeatedly shuttled forward and backward short distances as compared to microcassettes, leading to the Mini-Cassette's use in the first generations of telephone answering machines, and continuing use in the niche markets of dictation and transcription, where fidelity is not critical, but robustness of storage is, and where analog media remained in use long after digital media had been introduced.http://www.dictation.philips.com/index.php?id=50&no;_cache=1&CC;=FL&tx;_mediarepository_pi2 Microcassette (L) and Mini-Cassette (R) The Mini-Cassette could be played in a compact cassette player with the use of an adapter.

They are sometimes contrasted with a brain‚Äìcomputer interface, which connects the brain to a computer rather than a device meant to replace missing biological functionality. Neural prostheses are a series of devices that can substitute a motor, sensory or cognitive modality that might have been damaged as a result of an injury or a disease. Cochlear implants provide an example of such devices. These devices substitute the functions performed by the eardrum and stapes while simulating the frequency analysis performed in the cochlea. A microphone on an external unit gathers the sound and processes it; the processed signal is then transferred to an implanted unit that stimulates the auditory nerve through a microelectrode array. Through the replacement or augmentation of damaged senses, these devices intend to improve the quality of life for those with disabilities. These implantable devices are also commonly used in animal experimentation as a tool to aid neuroscientists in developing a greater understanding of the brain and its functioning. By wirelessly monitoring the brain's electrical signals sent out by electrodes implanted in the subject's brain, the subject can be studied without the device affecting the results. Accurately probing and recording the electrical signals in the brain would help better understand the relationship among a local population of neurons that are responsible for a specific function. Neural implants are designed to be as small as possible in order to be minimally invasive, particularly in areas surrounding the brain, eyes or cochlea. These implants typically communicate with their prosthetic counterparts wirelessly. Additionally, power is currently received through wireless power transmission through the skin. The tissue surrounding the implant is usually highly sensitive to temperature rise, meaning that power consumption must be minimal in order to prevent tissue damage. The neuroprosthetic currently undergoing the most widespread use is the cochlear implant, with over 300,000 in use worldwide . History The first known cochlear implant was created in 1957. Other milestones include the first motor prosthesis for foot drop in hemiplegia in 1961, the first auditory brainstem implant in 1977 and a peripheral nerve bridge implanted into the spinal cord of an adult rat in 1981. In 1988, the lumbar anterior root implant and functional electrical stimulation (FES) facilitated standing and walking, respectively, for a group of paraplegics.Handa G (2006) \\"Neural Prosthesis ‚Äì Past, Present and Future\\" Indian Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation 17(1) Regarding the development of electrodes implanted in the brain, an early difficulty was reliably locating the electrodes, originally done by inserting the electrodes with needles and breaking off the needles at the desired depth. Recent systems utilize more advanced probes, such as those used in deep brain stimulation to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The problem with either approach is that the brain floats free in the skull while the probe does not, and relatively minor impacts, such as a low speed car accident, are potentially damaging. Some researchers, such as Kensall Wise at the University of Michigan, have proposed tethering 'electrodes to be mounted on the exterior surface of the brain' to the inner surface of the skull. However, even if successful, tethering would not resolve the problem in devices meant to be inserted deep into the brain, such as in the case of deep brain stimulation (DBS). =Visual prosthetics= A visual prosthesis can create a sense of image by electrically stimulating neurons in the visual system. A camera would wirelessly transmit to an implant, the implant would map the image across an array of electrodes. The array of electrodes has to effectively stimulate 600-1000 locations, stimulating these optic neurons in the retina thus will create an image. The stimulation can also be done anywhere along the optic signal's path way. The optical nerve can be stimulated in order to create an image, or the visual cortex can be stimulated, although clinical tests have proven most successful for retinal implants. A visual prosthesis system consists of an external (or implantable) imaging system which acquires and processes the video. Power and data will be transmitted to the implant wirelessly by the external unit. The implant uses the received power/data to convert the digital data to an analog output which will be delivered to the nerve via micro electrodes. Photoreceptors are the specialized neurons that convert photons into electrical signals. They are part of the retina, a multilayer neural structure about 200 um thick that lines the back of the eye. The processed signal is sent to the brain through the optical nerve. If any part of this pathway is damaged blindness can occur. Blindness can result from damage to the optical pathway (cornea, aqueous humor, crystalline lens, and vitreous). This can happen as a result of accident or disease. The two most common retinal degenerative diseases that result in blindness secondary to photoreceptor loss is age related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The first clinical trial of a permanently implanted retinal prosthesis was a device with a passive microphotodiode array with 3500 elements.A. Y. Chow, V. Y. Chow, K. Packo, J. Pollack, G. Peyman, and R. Schuchard, \\"The artificial silicon retina microchip for the treatment of vision loss from retinitis pigmentosa,\\" Arch.Ophthalmol., vol. 122, p. 460, 2004 This trial was implemented at Optobionics, Inc., in 2000. In 2002, Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. (Sylmar, CA) began a trial with a prototype epiretinal implant with 16 electrodes. The subjects were six individuals with bare light perception secondary to RP. The subjects demonstrated their ability to distinguish between three common objects (plate, cup, and knife) at levels statistically above chance. An active sub retinal device developed by Retina Implant GMbH (Reutlingen, Germany) began clinical trials in 2006. An IC with 1500 microphotodiodes was implanted under the retina. The microphotodiodes serve to modulate current pulses based on the amount of light incident on the photo diode.M. J. McMahon, A. Caspi, J. D.Dorn, K. H. McClure, M. Humayun, and R. Greenberg, \\"Spatial vision in blind subjects implanted with the second sight retinal prosthesis,\\" presented at the ARVO Annu. Meeting, Ft. Lauderdale, FL, 2007. The seminal experimental work towards the development of visual prostheses was done by cortical stimulation using a grid of large surface electrodes. In 1968 Giles Brindley implanted an 80 electrode device on the visual cortical surface of a 52-year-old blind woman. As a result of the stimulation the patient was able to see phosphenes in 40 different positions of the visual field.G. S. Brindley and W. S. Lewin, \\"The sensations produced by electrical stimulation of the visual cortex,\\" J. Physiol., vol. 196, p. 479, 1968 This experiment showed that an implanted electrical stimulator device could restore some degree of vision. Recent efforts in visual cortex prosthesis have evaluated efficacy of visual cortex stimulation in a non-human primate. In this experiment after a training and mapping process the monkey is able to perform the same visual saccade task with both light and electrical stimulation. The requirements for a high resolution retinal prosthesis should follow from the needs and desires of blind individuals who will benefit from the device. Interactions with these patients indicate that mobility without a cane, face recognition and reading are the main necessary enabling capabilities.Weiland JD, Humayun MS. 2008. Visual prosthesis. Proceedings of the IEEE 96:1076-84 The results and implications of fully functional visual prostheses are exciting. However, the challenges are grave. In order for a good quality image to be mapped in the retina a high number of micro-scale electrode arrays are needed. Also, the image quality is dependent on how much information can be sent over the wireless link. Also this high amount of information must be received and processed by the implant without much power dissipation which can damage the tissue. The size of the implant is also of great concern. Any implant would be preferred to be minimally invasive. With this new technology, several scientists, including Karen Moxon at Drexel, John Chapin at SUNY, and Miguel Nicolelis at Duke University, started research on the design of a sophisticated visual prosthesis. Other scientists have disagreed with the focus of their research, arguing that the basic research and design of the densely populated microscopic wire was not sophisticated enough to proceed. =Auditory prosthetics= (For receiving sound) Cochlear implants (CIs), auditory brain stem implants (ABIs), and auditory midbrain implants (AMIs) are the three main categories for auditory prostheses. CI electrode arrays are implanted in the cochlea, ABI electrode arrays stimulate the cochlear nucleus complex in the lower brain stem, and AMIs stimulates auditory neurons in the inferior colliculus. Cochlear implants have been very successful among these three categories. Today the Advanced Bionics Corporation, the Cochlear Corporation and the Med-El Corporation are the major commercial providers of cochlea implants. In contrast to traditional hearing aids that amplify sound and send it through the external ear, cochlear implants acquire and process the sound and convert it into electrical energy for subsequent delivery to the auditory nerve. The microphone of the CI system receives sound from the external environment and sends it to processor. The processor digitizes the sound and filters it into separate frequency bands that are sent to the appropriate tonotonic region in the cochlea that approximately corresponds to those frequencies. In 1957, French researchers A. Djourno and C. Eyries, with the help of D. Kayser, provided the first detailed description of directly stimulation the auditory nerve in a human subject.J. K. Niparko and B. W. Wilson, \\"History of cochlear implants,\\" in Cochlear Implants:Principles and Practices. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2000, pp. 103‚Äì108 The individuals described hearing chirping sounds during simulation. In 1972, the first portable cochlear implant system in an adult was implanted at the House Ear Clinic. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) formally approved the marketing of the House-3M cochlear implant in November 1984.W. F. House, Cochlear implants: My perspective Improved performance on cochlear implant not only depends on understanding the physical and biophysical limitations of implant stimulation but also on an understanding of the brain's pattern processing requirements. Modern signal processing represents the most important speech information while also providing the brain the pattern recognition information that it needs. Pattern recognition in the brain is more effective than algorithmic preprocessing at identifying important features in speech. A combination of engineering, signal processing, biophysics, and cognitive neuroscience was necessary to produce the right balance of technology to maximize the performance of auditory prosthesis.Fayad JN, Otto SR, Shannon RV, Brackmann DE. 2008. Cochlear and brainstern auditory prostheses \\"neural interface for hearing restoration: Cochlear and brain stem implants\\". Proceedings of the IEEE 96:1085-95 Cochlear implants have been also used to allow acquiring of spoken language development in congenitally deaf children, with remarkable success in early implantations (before 2‚Äì4 years of life have been reached).Kral A, O'Donoghue GM. Profound Deafness in Childhood. New England J Medicine 2010: 363; 1438-50 There have been about 80,000 children implanted worldwide. The concept of combining simultaneous electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) for the purposes of better hearing was first described by C. von Ilberg and J. Kiefer, from the Universit√§tsklinik Frankfurt, Germany, in 1999.V. Ilberg C., Kiefer J., Tillein J., Pfennigdorff T., Hartmann R., St√ºrzebecher E., Klinke R. (1999). Electric-acoustic stimulation of the auditory system. ORL 61:334-340. That same year the first EAS patient was implanted. Since the early 2000s FDA has been involved in a clinical trial of device termed the \\"Hybrid\\" by Cochlear Corporation. This trial is aimed at examining the usefulness of cochlea implantation in patients with residual low-frequency hearing. The \\"Hybrid\\" utilizes a shorter electrode than the standard cochlea implant, since the electrode is shorter it stimulates the basil region of the cochlea and hence the high-frequency tonotopic region. In theory these devices would benefit patients with significant low-frequency residual hearing who have lost perception in the speech frequency range and hence have decreased discrimination scores.B.

Neurotol., vol. 11 (suppl.), pp. 63‚Äì68, 2006, Vol 1 For producing sound see Speech synthesis. =Prosthetics for pain relief= The SCS (Spinal Cord Stimulator) device has two main components: an electrode and a generator. The technical goal of SCS for neuropathic pain is to mask the area of a patient's pain with a stimulation induced tingling, known as \\"paresthesia\\", because this overlap is necessary (but not sufficient) to achieve pain relief.R. B. North, M. E. Ewend, M. A. Lawton, and S. Piantadosi, \\"Spinal cord stimulation for chronic, intractable pain: Superiority of 'multi-channel' devices,\\" Pain, vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 119‚Äì130, 1991 Paresthesia coverage depends upon which afferent nerves are stimulated. The most easily recruited by a dorsal midline electrode, close to the pial surface of spinal cord, are the large dorsal column afferents, which produce broad paresthesia covering segments caudally. In ancient times the electrogenic fish was used as a shocker to subside pain. Healers had developed specific and detailed techniques to exploit the generative qualities of the fish to treat various types of pain, including headache. Because of the awkwardness of using a living shock generator, a fair level of skill was required to deliver the therapy to the target for the proper amount of time. (Including keeping the fish alive as long as possible) Electro analgesia was the first deliberate application of electricity. By the nineteenth century, most western physicians were offering their patients electrotherapy delivered by portable generator.D. Fishlock, \\"Doctor volts [electrotherapy],\\" Inst. Elect. Eng. Rev., vol. 47, pp. 23‚Äì28, May 2001 In the mid-1960s, however, three things converged to ensure the future of electro stimulation. # Pacemaker technology, which had it start in 1950, became available. # Melzack and Wall published their gate control theory of pain, which proposed that the transmission of pain could be blocked by stimulation of large afferent fibers.P. Melzack and P. D. Wall, \\"Pain mechanisms: A new theory,\\" Science, vol. 150, no. 3699, pp. 971‚Äì978, Nov. 1965 # Pioneering physicians became interested in stimulating the nervous system to relieve patients from pain. The design options for electrodes include their size, shape, arrangement, number, and assignment of contacts and how the electrode is implanted. The design option for the pulse generator include the power source, target anatomic placement location, current or voltage source, pulse rate, pulse width, and number of independent channels. Programming options are very numerous (a four-contact electrode offers 50 functional bipolar combinations). The current devices use computerized equipment to find the best options for use. This reprogramming option compensates for postural changes, electrode migration, changes in pain location, and suboptimal electrode placement.North RB. 2008. Neural interface devices: Spinal cord stimulation technology. Proceedings of the IEEE 96:1108‚Äì19 Motor prosthetics Devices which support the function of autonomous nervous system include the implant for bladder control. In the somatic nervous system attempts to aid conscious control of movement include Functional electrical stimulation and the lumbar anterior root stimulator. =Bladder control implants= Where a spinal cord lesion leads to paraplegia, patients have difficulty emptying their bladders and this can cause infection. From 1969 onwards Brindley developed the sacral anterior root stimulator, with successful human trials from the early 1980s onwards.Brindley GS, Polkey CE, Rushton DN (1982): Sacral anterior root stimulator for bladder control in paraplegia. Paraplegia 20: 365-381. This device is implanted over the sacral anterior root ganglia of the spinal cord; controlled by an external transmitter, it delivers intermittent stimulation which improves bladder emptying. It also assists in defecation and enables male patients to have a sustained full erection. The related procedure of sacral nerve stimulation is for the control of incontinence in able-bodied patients.Schmidt RA, Jonas A, Oleson KA, Janknegt RA, Hassouna MM, Siegel SW, van Kerrebroeck PE. Sacral nerve stimulation for treatment of refractory urinary urge incontinence. Sacral nerve study group. J Urol 1999 Aug;16(2):352-357. =Motor prosthetics for conscious control of movement= Researchers are currently investigating and building motor neuroprosthetics that will help restore movement and the ability to communicate with the outside world to persons with motor disabilities such as tetraplegia or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Research has found that the striatum plays a crucial role in motor sensory learning. This was demonstrated by an experiment in which lab rats' firing rates of the striatum was recorded at higher rates after performing a task consecutively. To capture electrical signals from the brain, scientists have developed microelectrode arrays smaller than a square centimeter that can be implanted in the skull to record electrical activity, transducing recorded information through a thin cable. After decades of research in monkeys, neuroscientists have been able to decode neuronal signals into movements. Completing the translation, researchers have built interfaces that allow patients to move computer cursors, and they are beginning to build robotic limbs and exoskeletons that patients can control by thinking about movement. The technology behind motor neuroprostheses is still in its infancy. Investigators and study participants continue to experiment with different ways of using the prostheses. Having a patient think about clenching a fist, for example, produces a different result than having him or her think about tapping a finger. The filters used in the prostheses are also being fine- tuned, and in the future, doctors hope to create an implant capable of transmitting signals from inside the skull wirelessly, as opposed to through a cable. Prior to these advancements, Philip Kennedy (Emory and Georgia Tech) had an operable if somewhat primitive system which allowed an individual with paralysis to spell words by modulating their brain activity. Kennedy's device used two neurotrophic electrodes: the first was implanted in an intact motor cortical region (e.g. finger representation area) and was used to move a cursor among a group of letters. The second was implanted in a different motor region and was used to indicate the selection. Developments continue in replacing lost arms with cybernetic replacements by using nerves normally connected to the pectoralis muscles. These arms allow a slightly limited range of motion, and reportedly are slated to feature sensors for detecting pressure and temperature. Dr. Todd Kuiken at Northwestern University and Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago has developed a method called targeted reinnervation for an amputee to control motorized prosthetic devices and to regain sensory feedback. In 2002 a Multielectrode array of 100 electrodes, which now forms the sensor part of a Braingate, was implanted directly into the median nerve fibers of scientist Kevin Warwick. The recorded signals were used to control a robot arm developed by Warwick's colleague, Peter Kyberd and was able to mimic the actions of Warwick's own arm.Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Andrews, B, Teddy, P and Shad, A:\\"The Application of Implant Technology for Cybernetic Systems\\", Archives of Neurology, 60(10), pp1369-1373, 2003 Additionally, a form of sensory feedback was provided via the implant by passing small electrical currents into the nerve. This caused a contraction of the first lumbrical muscle of the hand and it was this movement that was perceived. In June 2014, Juliano Pinto, a paraplegic athlete, performed the ceremonial first kick at the 2014 FIFA World Cup using a powered exoskeleton with a brain interface.'We Did It!' Brain-Controlled 'Iron Man' Suit Kicks Off World Cup The exoskeleton was developed by the Walk Again Project at the laboratory of Miguel Nicolelis, funded by the government of Brazil. Nicolelis says that feedback from replacement limbs (for example, information about the pressure experienced by a prosthetic foot touching the ground) is necessary for balance. He has found that as long as people can see the limbs being controlled by a brain interface move at the same time as issuing the command to do so, with repeated use the brain will assimilate the externally powered limb and it will start to perceive it (in terms of position awareness and feedback) as part of the body.Brain-To-Brain Communication (audio interview with Dr. Miguel Nicolelis) =Amputation techniques= The MIT Biomechatronics Group has designed a novel amputation paradigm that enables biological muscles and myoelectric prostheses to interface neurally with high reliability. This surgical paradigm, termed the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI), provides the user with the ability to sense and control their prosthetic limb as an extension of their own body, rather than using a prosthetic that merely resembles an appendage. In a normal agonist- antagonist muscle pair relationship (e.g. bicep-tricep), when the agonist muscle contracts, the antagonist muscle is stretched, and vice versa, providing one with the knowledge of the position of one's limb without even having to look at it. During a standard amputation, agonist-antagonist muscles (e.g. bicep-tricep) are isolated from each other, preventing the ability to have the dynamic contract-extend mechanism that generates sensory feedback. Therefore, current amputees have no way of feeling the physical environment their prosthetic limb encounters. Moreover, with the current amputation surgery which has been in place for over 200 years, 1/3 patients undergo revision surgeries due to pain in their stumps. An AMI is composed of two muscles that originally shared an agonist-antagonist relationship. During the amputation surgery, these two muscles are mechanically linked together within the amputated stump.\\"On prosthetic control: A regenerative agonist-antagonist myoneural interface\\",' 'Science Robotics' ', 31 May 2017 One AMI muscle pair can be created for each joint degree of freedom in a patient in order to establish control and sensation of multiple prosthetic joints. In preliminary testing of this new neural interface, patients with an AMI have demonstrated and reported greater control over the prosthesis. Additionally, more naturally reflexive behavior during stair walking was observed compared to subjects with a traditional amputation.\\"Proprioception from a neurally controlled lower- extremity prosthesis\\",' ' Science Translational Medicine' ', 30 May 2018 An AMI can also be constructed through the combination of two devascularized muscle grafts. These muscle grafts (or flaps) are spare muscle that is denervated (detached from original nerves) and removed from one part of the body to be re-innervated by severed nerves found in the limb to be amputated. Through the use of regenerated muscle flaps, AMIs can be created for patients with muscle tissue that has experienced extreme atrophy or damage or for patients who are undergoing revision of an amputated limb for reasons such as neuroma pain, bone spurs, etc.  Obstacles  = Mathematical modelling = Accurate characterization of the nonlinear input/output (I/O) parameters of the normally functioning tissue to be replaced is paramount to designing a prosthetic that mimics normal biologic synaptic signals.Bertaccini, D., & Fanelli, S. (2009). Computational and conditioning issues of a discrete model for cochlear sensorineural hypoacusia. [Article]. Applied Numerical Mathematics, 59(8), 1989-2001.Marmarelis, V. Z. (1993). IDENTIFICATION OF NONLINEAR BIOLOGICAL-SYSTEMS USING LAGUERRE EXPANSIONS OF KERNELS. [Article]. Annals of Biomedical Engineering, 21(6), 573-589. Mathematical modeling of these signals is a complex task \\"because of the nonlinear dynamics inherent in the cellular/molecular mechanisms comprising neurons and their synaptic connections\\".T.W. Berger, T.P. Harty, X. Xie, G. Barrionuevo, and R.J. Sclabassi, \\"Modeling of neuronal networks through experimental decomposition,\\" in Proc. IEEE 34th Mid Symp. Cir. Sys., Monterey, CA, 1991, vol. 1, pp. 91‚Äì97.T.W. Berger, G. Chauvet, and R.J. Sclabassi, \\"A biologically based model of functional properties of the hippocampus,\\" Neural Netw., vol. 7, no. 6‚Äì7, pp. 1031‚Äì1064, 1994.S.S. Dalal, V.Z. Marmarelis, and T.W. Berger, \\"A nonlinear positive feedback model of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in dentate gyrus,\\" in Proc. 4th Joint Symp. Neural Computation, California, 1997, vol. 7, pp. 68‚Äì75. The output of nearly all brain neurons are dependent on which post- synaptic inputs are active and in what order the inputs are received. (spatial and temporal properties, respectively).Berger, T. W., Ahuja, A., Courellis, S. H., Deadwyler, S. A., Erinjippurath, G., Gerhardt, G. A., et al. (2005). Restoring lost cognitive function. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, 24(5), 30-44. Once the I/O parameters are modeled mathematically, integrated circuits are designed to mimic the normal biologic signals. For the prosthetic to perform like normal tissue, it must process the input signals, a process known as transformation, in the same way as normal tissue. = Size = Implantable devices must be very small to be implanted directly in the brain, roughly the size of a quarter. One of the example of microimplantable electrode array is the Utah array. Wireless controlling devices can be mounted outside of the skull and should be smaller than a pager. = Power consumption = Power consumption drives battery size. Optimization of the implanted circuits reduces power needs. Implanted devices currently need on-board power sources. Once the battery runs out, surgery is needed to replace the unit. Longer battery life correlates to fewer surgeries needed to replace batteries. One option that could be used to recharge implant batteries without surgery or wires is being used in powered toothbrushes. These devices make use of inductive coupling to recharge batteries. Another strategy is to convert electromagnetic energy into electrical energy, as in radio-frequency identification tags. = Biocompatibility = Cognitive prostheses are implanted directly in the brain, so biocompatibility is a very important obstacle to overcome. Materials used in the housing of the device, the electrode material (such as iridium oxideS Negi, R. Bhandari, L Rieth, R V Wagenen, and F Solzbacher, ‚ÄúNeural Electrode Degradation from Continuous Electrical Stimulation: Comparison of Sputtered and Activated Iridium Oxide‚Äù, Journal of Neuroscience Methods, vol. 186, pp. 8-17, 2010.), and electrode insulation must be chosen for long term implantation. Subject to Standards: ISO 14708-3 2008-11-15, Implants for Surgery - Active implantable medical devices Part 3: Implantable neurostimulators. Crossing the blood‚Äìbrain barrier can introduce pathogens or other materials that may cause an immune response. The brain has its own immune system that acts differently from the immune system of the rest of the body. Questions to answer: How does this affect material choice? Does the brain have unique phages that act differently and may affect materials thought to be biocompatible in other areas of the body? = Data transmission = Wireless Transmission is being developed to allow continuous recording of neuronal signals of individuals in their daily life. This allows physicians and clinicians to capture more data, ensuring that short term events like epileptic seizures can be recorded, allowing better treatment and characterization of neural disease. A small, light weight device has been developed that allows constant recording of primate brain neurons at Stanford University.HermesC: Low-Power Wireless Neural Recording System for Freely Moving Primates Chestek, C.A.; Gilja, V.; Nuyujukian, P.; Kier, R.J.; Solzbacher, F.; Ryu, S.I.; Harrison, R.R.; Shenoy, K.V.; Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Volume 17, Issue 4, Aug. 2009 Page(s):330 - 338. This technology also enables neuroscientists to study the brain outside of the controlled environment of a lab. Methods of data transmission must be robust and secure. Neurosecurity is a new issue. Makers of cognitive implants must prevent unwanted downloading of information or thoughts from and uploading of detrimental data to the device that may interrupt function. = Correct implantation = Implantation of the device presents many problems. First, the correct presynaptic inputs must be wired to the correct postsynaptic inputs on the device. Secondly, the outputs from the device must be targeted correctly on the desired tissue. Thirdly, the brain must learn how to use the implant. Various studies in brain plasticity suggest that this may be possible through exercises designed with proper motivation.  Technologies involved  = Local field potentials = Local field potentials (LFPs) are electrophysiological signals that are related to the sum of all dendritic synaptic activity within a volume of tissue. Recent studies suggest goals and expected value are high-level cognitive functions that can be used for neural cognitive prostheses.Andersen, R. A., Burdick, J. W., Musallam, S., Pesaran, B., & Cham, J. G. (2004). Cognitive neural prosthetics. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8(11), 486-493. Also, Rice University scientists have discovered a new method to tune the light-induced vibrations of nanoparticles through slight alterations to the surface to which the particles are attached. According to the university, the discovery could lead to new applications of photonics from molecular sensing to wireless communications. They used ultrafast laser pulses to induce the atoms in gold nanodisks to vibrate.The Engineer.London United Kingdom.Centaur Communications Ltd. 2015, May 8 = Automated movable electrical probes = One hurdle to overcome is the long term implantation of electrodes. If the electrodes are moved by physical shock or the brain moves in relation to electrode position, the electrodes could be recording different nerves. Adjustment to electrodes is necessary to maintain an optimal signal. Individually adjusting multi electrode arrays is a very tedious and time consuming process. Development of automatically adjusting electrodes would mitigate this problem. Anderson's group is currently collaborating with Yu-Chong Tai's lab and the Burdick lab (all at Caltech) to make such a system that uses electrolysis-based actuators to independently adjust electrodes in a chronically implanted array of electrodes.Anderson, R.A. et al (2004) Cognitive Neural Prosthetics. Trends in Cognitive Sciences. 8(11):486-493. = Imaged guided surgical techniques = Image-guided surgery is used to precisely position brain implants.

It is situated in the ≈†ari≈° region on a floodplain terrace of the Topƒæa River, in the hills of the Beskyd Mountains. It exhibits numerous cultural monuments in its completely intact medieval town center. The town is one of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites and currently maintains a population of about 32,000 inhabitants. Etymology There are two theories about the origin of the name. According to one theory, the name town comes from the Hungarian word \\"b√°rd\\" (), which indicated an amount of forested territory which could be chopped down by one man in one day. In the Hungarian name (B√°rtfa), the \\"fa\\" (English: \\"tree\\") suffix came later, and it also changed the last letter of \\"b√°rd\\" to \\"b√°rt\\", for easier pronunciation. Another theory derives the name from a Christian personal name Bardƒõj, Barduj (abbreviated forms of Bartholomew) with common Slavic possessive suffix -ov. This theory is supported by the first recorded form of the name ‚Äì Bardujef (1241). The motivation by the personal name is supported also by the presence of the suffix preserved in later Polish or Slovak sources. History The territory of present-day Bardejov has attracted settlers since the Stone Age. However, the first written reference to the town dates back to the 1240s, when monks from Bardejov complained to King B√©la IV of Hungary about a violation of the town's borders by Pre≈°ov. By that time, the important church of Sv. Aegidius (St. Giles) had already been built. Heavily fortified in the 14th century, the town became a center of trade with Poland. More than 50 guilds controlled the flourishing economy. Bardejov gained the status of a royal town in 1376, later becoming a free royal town. The town‚Äôs golden age ended in the 16th century, when several wars, pandemics, and other disasters plagued the country. Beginning in the first quarter of the 18th century, the situation began to improve. Slovaks and Hasidic Jews came into Bardejov in large numbers. By the end of the century, the population of the town had regained the level of the 16th century.http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/Slovakia/Bardejov-686222/TravelGuide- Bardejov.html The burghers' houses were rebuilt or modified in keeping with current architectural fashion. A Jewish quarter with a synagogue, slaughterhouse, and ritual baths developed in the north-western suburbs. New churches and bridges were built, as well. During the Reformation, Michal Rada≈°in was called as town pastor. Despite further fires in the last quarter of the 19th century, the town continued to thrive, thanks to major industrialization projects in the region. In 1893, a railway was opened connecting Presov to Bardejov. However, it declined again following the establishment of the first Czechoslovak Republic and became a backward farming region. World War II saw a worsening in the economic situation, though little damage from bombardment. Bardejov was taken by Soviet troops of the 1st Guards Army on 20 January 1945. In 1950, Bardejov was declared a protected city core and extensive restoration of its cultural heritage began. These efforts culminated in Bardejov receiving the European Gold Medal by the International Board of Trustees in Hamburg in 1986 ‚Äì the first town in Czechoslovakia to receive the award. On November 20, 2000, Bardejov was selected by UNESCO as one of its World Heritage Sites, recognized for its Jewish Suburbia and historic town center. In November 2010, the city marked the 10th anniversary of its inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Today, Bardejov is known mainly for its authentic old town square, which due to extensive restoration and preservation of its Medieval, Renaissance, and Gothic architecture has made Bardejov a popular tourist destination. The town draws on its rich heritage to further develop cultural traditions, such as an annual trade fair and the Roland Games (commemorating its medieval past). Like many European small towns, Bardejov maintained a strong Jewish population before World War II and the Holocaust, as well as a German-speaking population which was expelled after 1945, although a small number of German speakers remains. In March 2006, the Bardejov Jewish Preservation Committee was founded as a non- profit organization by Emil Fish, a survivor of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp who was born in Bardejov. In July 2005, Mr. Fish returned to Bardejov with his wife and son for the first time since 1949. His response to the disrepair and dilapidation of the synagogues and the Jewish cemetery was a resolve to restore and preserve these properties. The committee is composed of Bardejov survivors, their descendants and friends, and others interested in commemorating the vanishing Jewish communities of Eastern Europe. Today, the committee's stated mission is to: \\"restore the Jewish properties of Bardejov, Slovakia\\"; \\"build awareness of the cultural and historical significance of Jewish life in Bardejov and Slovakia\\"; and \\"advance knowledge of Jewish ancestry and heritage.\\" Landmarks Central square with the Church of St. Aegidius Bardejov is dominated by the monumental Church of St. Aegidius (Giles), mentioned for the first time in 1247. A three nave basilica with multiple chapels was completed in 1464.Bardejov It hosts eleven precious Gothic winged altars with panel paintings. The central square (Slovak: Radniƒçn√© n√°mestie), which used to be the town‚Äôs medieval marketplace, is surrounded by well-preserved Gothic and Renaissance burghers‚Äô houses as well as the basilica. One of the most interesting buildings is the town hall, built in 1505. The lower part was built in the Gothic style, while the upper part was finished in the Renaissance style. This was the headquarters of the city council and also the center of the town's economic, social, and cultural life.Bardejov In 1903, the town hall was adapted to serve as ≈†ari≈° County Museum (S√°rosi m√∫zeum), now known as the ≈†ari≈° Museum Bardejov, one of the oldest and the biggest museums in Slovakia. The fortification system and town walls date from the 14th and 15th centuries and are listed by the European Fund of Cultural Heritage as one of the most elaborate and best preserved medieval fortifications in Slovakia. About north of Bardejov is the spa town Bardejovsk√© K√∫pele. The therapeutic mineral water springs are claimed to be beneficial to people with oncological, blood circulation, and digestive tract problems. It also hosts an open-air museum of folk architecture (skansen). The spa has played host to a number of dignitaries, including Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma (the wife of Napoleon Bonaparte), Tsar Alexander I of Russia and Empress Elisabeth of Austria-Hungary. Boroughs The town consists of the following boroughs: # Bardejov # Bardejovsk√° Nov√° Ves # Bardejovsk√° Z√°bava # Bardejovsk√© K√∫pele (local spa town) # Dlh√° L√∫ka (annexed in 1971) # Mihaƒæov Demographics Bardejov has a population of 33,020 (as of December 31, 2010). According to the 2001 census, 91.3% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 2.6% Romani, 2.5% Rusyns, and 1.4% Ukrainians. The religious make-up was 63.2% Roman Catholics, 16.9% Greek Catholics, 7.6% Lutherans and 4.3% Eastern Orthodox. By the 1910 census, it had 2,571 Slovak, 2,179 Hungarian and 1,617 German inhabitants. Jews lived in the town for about 300 years. By the 1920s Jews made up 34% of the total population of Bardejov. In 1942, when Slovakia was under the influence of Nazi Germany, more than 3,000 Jews from Bardejov were deported to concentration camps, where most were murdered. Bardejov is now a \\"town without Jews.\\"http://bardejov.org/a/jewish-bardejov Bardejov Jewish History The town was the northest Hungarian majority settlement until the Ottoman wars near the Polish border.

Early life Qu was born in Changzhou, Jiangsu. His family lived in Tianxiang Lou () located on Qingguo Lane (). Qu's father, Qu Shiwei (), was born in a family that was once powerful. He was good at painting and fencing and acquired much medical knowledge, but had no interest in politics and business. Qu's mother, Jin Xuan (), the daughter of an elite government official, was skilled in poetry. Qu had five brothers and one sister, he being the eldest. When Qu was young, his family lived in his uncle's house and was supported financially by relatives. Though Qu's father took a job as teacher, he was not able to support his family due to his addiction to opium. In 1915, Qu's mother, overcome by her life's mounting difficulties and debts, committed suicide. In 1916, Qu went to Hankou and entered Wuchang Foreign Language School to learn English with the support of his cousin. In the spring of 1917, Qu went to Beijing to apply for a job, but did not pass the general civil service examination. Not having enough money to pay for a regular university tuition, Qu enrolled in the newly established Russian Language Institute under the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (), since it did not require payment of fee. The institute also offered a stipend and promised him a job upon graduation. Communist Party involvement Qu worked hard in the language institute, learning both French and Russian and spending his spare time studying Buddhist philosophy and classical Chinese. Both were his interests cultivated since childhood, as well as the works of Bertrand Russell whose discussion of physics and perception was to Qu similar to the teachings of Buddhism. His earliest contacts with revolutionary circles came when he participated in discussions of Marxist analysis hosted by Li Dazhao at Beijing University, who was the campus' head librarian. The future communist leader and chairman of China Mao Zedong was also present at these meetings. Qu later took a job as a journalist for a Beijing newspaper Morning News () and was sent to Moscow as a correspondent, even though this would jeopardise a career in the civil service which his earlier training had prepared him for. Qu was one of the first Chinese to report from Moscow about life in Russia during and after the Bolshevik Revolution, where he observed the harshness of living conditions. While in Russia, he also visited Leo Tolstoy's home at Yasnaya Polyana with Tolstoy's granddaughter Sofya, saw Lenin addressing a group of delegates, heard Feodor Chaliapin sing Alexander Pushkin's poems set to music, and witnessed Pyotr Kropotkin's funeral. In January 1923, Qu accepted the invitation from Chen Duxiu, leader of the Communist Party of China at that time, to come back from Russia to join in his cause. After returning, Qu was responsible for the propaganda work of Communist Party of China. In 1927 after the fall of Chen Duxiu, he became acting Chairman of the Chinese Politburo and the de facto leader of the party. He organised actions such as the Guangzhou Uprising of December 11, 1927. In April 1928, Qu went to Moscow once again and worked as a delegate of the Chinese Communist Party for two years. In 1930, after being dismissed as Chinese Communist Party representative in Russia, Qu returned to China only to be also dismissed from the central leadership. This was all due to an intense argument over how the revolution should be carried out. Following his dismissal, Qu worked both as a writer and a translator in Shanghai, fought literary battles along with Mao Dun and Lu Xun and forged a profound friendship with leaders of the left-wing cultural movement. Assassination In 1934, the situation became increasingly dangerous and Qu could not stay in Shanghai any longer, so he went to the Communists' Central Revolutionary Base Area in Ruijin, Jiangxi province. When the Red Army began the famous Long March, Qu stayed in the south to lead the bush fighting. Arrested in Changting, Fujian in 1934, Qu was sentenced to death by Kuomintang a year later. During his arrest, Qu was tortured by the KMT government, who adopted various means to induce him to capitulate, but he was persistent in his beliefs and refused. On 18 June 1935, Qu walked calmly toward the execution place, Zhongshan Park in Changting, singing \\"The Internationale\\", the \\"Red Army Song\\", and shouting \\"Long live the Chinese Communist Party\\", \\"Long live communism\\" and other slogans. After reaching Luohanling, a small hill in Zhongshan Park, Qu chose a place to sit down on the grass, smiled and nodded to the executioner, saying \\"very good here!\\". Qu was only 36 when he was shot dead.http://baike.baidu.com/view/1807.htm 2011.6.18 During his arrest, Qu wrote a book named Superfluous Words to express his political thinking and traced his change from a literatus to a revolutionist. The book stirred a controversy after his death. Legacy Qu was heavily criticised as a \\"renegade\\" during the Cultural Revolution. However, the Central Committee absolved him in 1980 and today he is held in very high regard by the Chinese Communist Party. A Qu Qiubai museum stands in his native town of Changzhou. Tsi-an Hsia () describes Qu in The Gate of Darkness: Studies on the Leftist Literary Movement in China (published 1968) as \\"the tenderhearted Communist\\". Qu and a Russian counterpart, V.S. Kolokolov, were responsible for the early development of the Sin Wenz system of Mandarin romanization.Êñ∞ÊñáÂ≠ó Sin Wenz 2011.6.18 Qu also translated The Internationale into Chinese, with his version recognised as the official one and used as the anthem of the Communist Party of China.http://history.cultural-china.com/en/59H7594H12613.html 2011.6.18 Qu was one of the major Chinese intellectuals to emerge from the May 4th Movement, and one of early Communist Party members who established the spirit of the revolutionary movement in China. He is also widely remembered as an emotive poet.

It begins at the adductor hiatus (an opening in the adductor magnus muscle) and is a continuation of the popliteal vein. It ends at the inferior margin of the inguinal ligament, where it becomes the external iliac vein. The femoral vein bears valves which are mostly bicuspid and whose number is variable between individuals and often between left and right leg. Segments Femoral vein segments. *The common femoral vein is the segment of the femoral vein between the branching point of the deep femoral vein and the inferior margin of the inguinal ligament.Page 590 in: *The subsartorial vein or superficial femoral vein are designations for the segment between the adductor hiatus and the branching point of the deep femoral vein, passing through the subsartorial canal. However, usage of the term superficial femoral vein is discouraged by many physicians because it leads to confusion among general medical practitioners. In particular, the femoral vein is clinically a deep vein, where deep vein thrombosis indicates anticoagulant or thrombolytic therapy, but the adjective \\"superficial\\" leads many physicians to falsely believe it is a superficial vein, which has resulted in patients with femoral thrombosis being denied proper treatment. Therefore, the term subsartorial vein has been suggested for the femoral vein distally to the branching point of the deep femoral vein. Drainage Several large veins drain into the femoral vein: * Great saphenous vein, into the common femoral vein. * Deep vein of the thigh, whose entry marks the border between the subsartorial vein and common femoral vein. * Popliteal vein, becoming the subsartorial or superficial femoral vein at the adductor hiatus. Clinical significance Occlusion of the femoral vein can be life- threatening due to its size. For example, deep vein thrombosis of the femoral vein can cause pulmonary embolism, with a higher risk when being more proximal to the subsartorial vein. The femoral vein is often used to place central venous lines. The practice of delivering recreational drugs intravenously using the femoral vein is relatively common amongst injecting drug users (IDUs).

Home sign systems often arise in families where a deaf child is raised by hearing parents and is isolated from the Deaf community. Because the deaf child does not receive signed or spoken language input, these children are referred to as linguistic isolates. Because home sign systems are used regularly as the child's form of communication, they develop to become more complex than simple gestures. Though not considered to be a complete language, these systems may be classified as linguistic phenomena that show similar characteristics to signed and spoken language. Home sign systems display significant degrees of internal complexity, using gestures with consistent meanings, word order, and grammatical categories. Linguists have been interested in home sign systems as insight into the human ability to generate, acquire, and process language. Identifying Features In 1987, Nancy Frishberg set out a framework for identifying and describing home-based sign systems. She states that home signs differ from sign languages in that they: * do not have a consistent meaning- symbol relationship, * do not pass on from generation to generation, * are not shared by one large group, * and are not considered the same over a community of signers. However, there are certain \\"resilient\\" properties of language whose development can proceed without guidance of a conventional language model. More recent studies of deaf children's gestural systems show systematicity and productivity. Across users, these systems tend to exhibit a stable lexicon, word order tendency, complex sentence usage, and noun-verb pairs. Gesture systems have also been shown to have the property of recursion, which allows system to be generative. Deaf children may borrow spoken language gestures, but these gestures are altered to serve as linguistic markers. As the child develops, their utterances grow in size and complexity. Adult home signers use systems that mature to display more linguistic features than the simpler systems used by child home signers. = Lexicon = Studies of home signing children and adults show consistent pairing between the form of a gesture token and its meaning. These signs are also combined in compound gestures to create new words. The lack of bidirectionality in creation of home sign systems between the parent and child restricts the invention of signs with arbitrary meanings. The emergence of a conventionalized lexicon proceeds slower in a home sign system than in natural languages with a richer social network. Study of adult home signers in Nicaragua show that home signers use gesture to communicate about number, with cardinal number and non-cardinal number markings. = Morphology = Home sign systems have simple morphology. Gestures are composed of parts with a limited set of handshape forms. Hand shapes can be used in two ways: to represent a hand as it manipulates an object, or to represent the object itself. Morphophonological patterns in handshape production are more similar to conventionalized sign language handshapes than hearing individuals‚Äô gestures. These handshapes are high in finger complexity for object handshapes and low in finger complexity for handling handshapes. Home signers also use handshape as a productive morphological marker in predicates, displaying a distinction between nominals and predicates. Study of adolescent home signers show ability to express motion events, though this strategy differs from conventional sign language. The motions of signs used in home sign systems can vary in length of path and directionality. Most of the hand shape morphemes could be found in combination with more than one motion morpheme, and vice versa. = Syntax = Within an individual system, home signers show consistency in a particular word order that distinguishes the subject of the utterance. Across home sign systems there is preference for action to be utterance-final. Structural dependency, words grouped based on a hierarchical structure or pattern, has been studied in Brazilian home signers who consistently produce modifiers with the noun modified. Gestural markers for negation (side to side head shake) and wh-form questions (manual flip) show consistent meaning, use, and position. Home signers mark grammatical subjects in sentences and are able to distinguish the subject from the topic of the sentence These systems show some evidence of a prosodic system for marking phrase and utterance boundaries. = Narratives = Home signing children vary greatly in how often they display narrative skills; however, their narratives show similar structural patterns. This includes elaborating on basic narrative by including setting, actions, a complication, and temporal order. Hearing mothers produce co-narration with deaf children less frequently (than hearing mothers do with hearing children), and these contributions are spoken and rarely gestural.  Conditions for Emergence  The context of home sign system creation includes limited or no exposure to a spoken or signed language model, isolation from Deaf children and adult, and parental choices regarding communication with the deaf child. Home sign creation is a common experience of deaf children in hearing families, as approximately 75% of hearing parents do not sign and communicate with their deaf children using a small set of gestures, speaking, and lipreading. In a home with parents who are Deaf or know sign language, a child can pick up the sign language in the same way a hearing child can pick up spoken language. Home signs are a starting point for many sign languages. When a group of deaf people come together without a common sign language, they may share features of their individual home sign systems creating a village sign language that may establish itself as a complete language over time. However, home signs are rarely passed on to more than one generation, because they generally fade when the deaf child is exposed to language outside of the home. Deaf children who use home sign are distinguished from feral children who are deprived of meaningful social and linguistic interaction. Home signing children are socially integrated to an extent with lack of conventional linguistic interaction. Home sign systems have some elements of language, and children who use these systems are able to acquire a natural sign language later in school. = Development of a Home sign System = The deaf child is the creator of a home sign system. Mothers of adult home signers in Nicaragua were evaluated to determine their role in the development of their child's home sign system. The results of this study concluded that mothers comprehended spoken Spanish descriptions of events better than home sign descriptions, and native ASL signers performed better than mothers at understanding home sign productions. This suggests that mothers do not directly transmit home sign systems to their deaf children. Though caregivers' co-speech gestures may serve as an initial foundation for their child's home sign system, children surpass this input. Hearing caregivers typically do not share the same gestural communication system with the deaf child, using fewer gestures with less consistency and displaying different sentence-level patterns. A deaf child's gestural system is more likely to overlap with that of another home signer, including cross culturally. Social network structure influences the development of a home sign system, impacting the conventionalization of referring expressions among members. Richly connected networks, where all participants interact with one another using the communication system, show greater and faster conventionalization. Home sign systems are typically sparsely connected networks, where the home signer communicates with each member of the network but the members do not use home sign to communicate with each other.  Impact of Lacking a Language Model  Recent studies by Deanna Gagne and Marie Coppola of perspective taking abilities in adult home signers, reveal that home signers do not pass experimental false belief tasks despite having visual observation of social interaction. False belief understanding, integral to the development of theory of mind, requires language experience and linguistic input. Further study of these adult home signers indicates that home signers show precursor abilities for theory of mind, such as visual perspective taking. Lack of conventional language for numbers has been shown to affect numerical ability. In comparison to unschooled hearing and signing deaf individuals, adult home signers do not consistently produce gestures that accurately represent cardinal values of larger sets and do not exhibit effective use of finger counting strategies. Further study indicates home signers are able to recall gestures used as nouns, verbs, and adjectives, but they show poor number recall, which worsens as number increases.  Cross-cultural Comparisons  Syntactic structure is similar between groups of home signers in different cultures and geographical regions, including word order preferences and complex sentence usage. For example, home sign systems of children in Turkey and America exhibit similar patterns in sentence-level structure. Certain gestures, such as pointing, head shaking, and shrugging, share similar meanings throughout cultures. Young children shake their heads to indicate negation before they express negative meanings through language. However, most young children use the head shake as an initial marker of negation, and replace it with speech or manual signs once language is acquired. Children using a home sign system don't have exposure to a structured language, and therefore don't replace the head shake with manual signs until language is acquired. Home sign systems differ across cultures in terms of gesture use by hearing caregivers. Compared to American mothers, Chinese mothers show more similarity in gesture form (handshape and motion) and syntax with systems used by their deaf children. In comparing narratives from Chinese and American deaf children, home signing children produce culturally appropriate narratives. Variability between home signers are group internal, with different individual home signers having their own set of gestures for the same type of object or predicate.  Examples  * Rennellese Sign Language of the Solomon Islands was used by a single deaf individual and his friends and family, and ended with his death. * Following the establishment of the first deaf schools in Nicaragua in the 1970s, the previously isolated deaf children quickly developed their own sign language, now known as Nicaraguan Sign Language, from the building blocks of their own diverse home sign systems. * For several reported sign languages, it's not clear if they are a collection of home sign used by various families, with similarities due to the common system of gestures used by the hearing population augmented by mime, or an incipient coherent sign language. Such systems include Marajo Sign Language in Brazil, described primarily between deaf mothers and their young children, Maxakali Sign Language, also in Brazil, which is at the least is a very young language, and Mehek Sign Language in northwestern Papua New Guinea, in which signs are quite variable between families, with only a few dozen held in common, all of which are highly mimetic. * Navajo family sign, distinct from the hearing Navajo way of signing, is more linguistically complex than general home sign systems where children are isolated from Deaf peers. Navajo family sign was used inter- generationally among deaf family members and were not replaced when the deaf children were exposed to standard sign language. * According to Anne Sullivan, Helen Keller had developed over sixty home signs long before she was taught to communicate through finger spelling. *One of Susan Goldin-Meadow's prominent studies focuses on the home sign system of a young boy named David. It was found that David used five handshapes (fist, O-shape, C-shape, flat palm, and pointing) that accounted for 98% of all handshapes in his home sign system, and eight different types of motions that accounted for 100% of the signs produced. *Adam Kendon published a celebrated study of the signing system of a deaf Enga woman from the Papua New Guinea highlands, in which he investigated the notion of iconicity in language and gesture. This Enga Sign Language is used by a range of hearing and deaf individuals. *Two deaf sisters in Japan, studied by Torigoe & Takei in 2002, developed their own communication system from their homesign system, which incorporated devices that enabled complex forms comparable to language.

Biography  Art installation Mascha Kal√©ko by Rengha Rodewill, Georg Kolbe Museum, Berlin Kal√©ko was born Golda Malka Aufen in Chrzan√≥w, Galicia (now Poland). She was the daughter of Fischel Engel, a merchant, and Rozalia Chaja Reisel Aufen, both of Jewish descent. With the commencement of World War I, her mother moved with her and her sister Lea to Germany; first to Frankfurt, then to Marburg, and in 1918 to Berlin where her parents married in 1922. In 1928, she married the Hebrew teacher Saul Aaron Kal√©ko. From 1929 on, she published poetry presenting the daily life of the common people in newspapers such as Vossische Zeitung and Berliner Tageblatt. In her poetry, Kal√©ko captured the atmosphere of Berlin in the 1930s. She attained fame and frequented places like the \\"Romanisches Caf√©\\", where the literary world met, among them Erich K√§stner and Kurt Tucholsky. In January 1933, Rowohlt published her first book with poetry Lyrisches Stenogrammheft, which was soon subjected to Nazi censorship, and two years later her second book Das kleine Lesebuch f√ºr Gro√üe appeared, also with the publisher Rowohlt. In 1938, Kal√©ko emigrated to the United States with her second husband, the composer , and their one-year-old son Steven, who became a writer and theatre personality in adult life. Steven fell ill with pancreatitis while directing a play in Massachusetts, and died in 1968 at the age of 31. While in the U.S., Kal√©ko lived in several places (New York City and a few months in California) until settling on Minetta Street in New York City's Greenwich Village in 1942. Her fifth-floor walkup apartment Minetta Street was a safe haven she always remembered fondly. Kal√©ko became the family's breadwinner with odd jobs, including some writing copy for advertisements. The family's hope of a possible career for Chemjo in the film industry was crushed, and they returned to New York after a brief stint in Hollywood. The Schoenhof Verlag in Cambridge, Massachusetts published Kal√©ko's third book \\"Verse f√ºr Zeitgenossen\\" in 1945 (German edition in 1958 by Rowohlt Verlag). In 1956, Kal√©ko returned to Berlin for the first time. Three years later she was supposed to receive the Fontane prize, which she declined since the former Nazi and member of the Waffen-SS, Hans Egon Holthusen, was a member of the jury. In 1959, Kal√©ko moved to West Jerusalem, Israel, since her husband, who was conducting research on Hassidic singing, had better working conditions there. She lacked knowledge of Hebrew and was thus somewhat isolated. Kal√©ko died in January 1975 in Z√ºrich, where she fell ill en route back to Jerusalem from a final visit in Berlin. She is buried in Israelitischer Friedhof Oberer Friesenberg.  Legacy  Some of Kal√©ko's poems were published posthumously, including \\"Sozusagen grundlos vergn√ºgt\\", in 1977 in the collection In meinen Tr√§umen l√§utet es Sturm (In my dreams, a storm is brewing). edited by , to whom Kal√©ko had entrusted her unpublished writings. Various attempts have been made to translate individual poems into English. In March 2010, for the first time, a representative number of Kal√©ko's poems appeared in English translation in the book 'No matter where I travel, I come to Nowhereland': The poetry of Mascha Kal√©ko (The University of Vermont, 2010, 112 pages). The author, Andreas Nolte, has selected poems from every phase of the poet's life. His translations follow the original German texts as closely as possible in order to maintain the Kal√©koesque content, diction, rhythm, and rhyme.

Released in 2001, it marked their first new recording in six and a half years. The record debuted at #37 on the charts in the United States, #22 in Canada, #25 in Spain. Only one single, \\"Rise\\", was officially released and had a music video. The songs \\"Breathe\\" and \\"True Believers\\" were released as promotional singles but not as official singles. This album also marked the return of Matt Sorum as The Cult's drummer. Although Sorum had previously toured with the band on the Sonic Temple tour in 1989 and 1990, this was the first time that he had recorded a studio album with the band. Background and writing The title of the record is a reference to Friedrich Nietzsche's 1886 book of the same title, and it briefly had the mock working title of Bring Me the Head of Dave Grohl, referencing the frontman of Foo Fighters, and also the former drummer of Nirvana. In 2006, singer Ian Astbury claimed via the band's website that his preferred choice for the record's title was Demon Process. \\"My Bridges Burn\\" was originally titled \\"Save Me\\"; \\"Breathe\\" originally had the slightly longer title \\"Breathe (You Bastard)\\" along with an overdub of keyboards after the guitar solo which was later removed; and \\"Speed of Light\\" went through several different titles: originally titled \\"Black California\\", then \\"Who Plays the Devil\\" before the band decided on its final title. There are several CD acetates of early recordings of the songs later featured on Beyond Good and Evil. A CD-R of demo versions of the songs leaked out, unofficially referred to as Unmixed, Unmastered, Unsequenced, and a bootleg CD-R of later, but still unfinished versions of the songs are also in circulation.

He studied in Zagreb, Karlovci, Szeged and Vienna before dropping out to join the army in 1809 during the War of the Fifth Coalition. On 10 April 1810, he became a monk of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Gomirje Monastery. On 24 June 1829 he became the Eparch of Dalmatia. On 5 July 1833 he became the Eparch of Vr≈°ac. In August 1842, he was named the Metropolitan of Karlovci. At the May Assembly of Serbs in Sremski Karlovci in 1848, from the balcony of the Sremski Karlovci town hall, he was appointed Patriarch of the Serbs, while Stevan ≈†upljikac was chosen as the first Duke (Voivode) of Serbian Vojvodina.

He then was brigade commander under Joseph Radetzky von Radetz, after which he was awarded with the Great Cross of the Iron Crown. In 1848 he took part in the suppression of Italian rebels in the Unification of Italy. As part of the Revolutions of 1848, the Serbs under Austria-Hungary demanded what they had in the previous century; recognition of Serbian as official language, equality of the Orthodox church as with Catholics, and annual church assembly gatherings.Jelavich, p. 316 They met at Sremski Karlovci and Novi Sad.

It was founded in 1932 under the fascist administration, as Littoria, when the area surrounding it which had been a swamp since antiquity was drained.  History  The inauguration of Littoria in 1932. Although the area was first settled by the Latins, the modern city was founded by Benito Mussolini on 30 June 1932 as Littoria, named for the fascio littorio. The city was inaugurated on 18 December of the same year. Littoria was populated with settlers coming mainly from Friuli and Veneto, who formed the so-called Venetian-Pontine community (today surviving only in some peripheral boroughs). The edifices and the monuments, mainly in rationalist style, were designed by famous architects and artists such as Marcello Piacentini, Angiolo Mazzoni and Duilio Cambellotti. In 1934 it became a provincial capital and, after World War II, renamed Latina in 1946. With the arrival of other people mostly from Lazio itself, the original Venetian-like dialect was increasingly substituted by a form of Romanesco dialect. The city coat of arms is a blue shield with a stylized drawing of the City Hall Clock Tower in the middle, standing on a field of green, and flanked by two stalks of wheat tied at the base with a red ribbon engraved with the motto \\"LATINA OLIM PALUS\\" (\\"Latina, once a swamp\\") in Latin. The shield is surmounted by a mural crown.  Economy  The city has some pharmaceutical, chemical industry and a strong service sector. Latina is also an important centre for agriculture (vegetables, flowers, sugar, fruit, cheese and derivates). The former Latina nuclear power plant has been shut down and is currently undergoing decommissioning. Government  Frazioni  The frazioni of Latina are: Latina Lido, Latina Scalo, Borgo Bainsizza, Borgo Carso, Borgo Faiti, Borgo Grappa, Borgo Isonzo, Borgo Montello, Borgo Piave, Borgo Podgora, Borgo Sabotino, Borgo Santa Maria, Borgo San Michele, Chiesuola, and Tor Tre Ponti.

In addition, its aim is to help identify new treatments for them and ways to prevent them in the first place. The IoPPN is a school of King's College London, England, previously known as the Institute of Psychiatry (IoP). The Institute works closely with South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Many senior academic staff also work as honorary consultants for the Trust in clinical services such as the National Psychosis Unit at Bethlem Royal Hospital. The impact of the Institute's work was judged to be 100% 'world-leading' or 'internationally-excellent' in the Research Excellence Framework (REF 2014). The research environment of the Institute was also rated 100% 'world-leading'. King's College London was rated the second for research in Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience in REF 2014. According to the 2016 US News Ranking, King's College London was ranked second in the world in Psychiatry and Psychology. History The IoPPN shares a great deal of its history with the Maudsley Hospital, with which it shares the location of its main building. It was part of the original plans of Frederick Mott and Henry Maudsley‚Äîinspired by the Munich institute of Emil Kraepelin‚Äîthat the hospital would include facilities for teaching and research in 1896. In 1914, London County Council agreed to establish a hospital in Denmark Hill and Mott‚Äôs plan began to take shape. The Maudsley Hospital was opened in 1923 as a result of a donation by Henry Maudsley. Originally established as the \\"Maudsley Hospital Medical School\\" in 1924, it changed its name to the Institute of Psychiatry in 1948, with Aubrey Lewis appointed to the inaugural Chair of Psychiatry (which he held until his retirement in 1966). The main Institute building was opened in 1967 and contains lecture theatres, administrative offices, library and canteen. In 1959 a group of genetic researchers led by Eliot Slater were given Medical Research Council funding to establish themselves as the 'MRC Psychiatric Genetics Unit'. Although this closed down in 1969, psychiatric genetics continued, eventually as the MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre (SGDP Centre) which moved into new purpose-built building in 2002. In 1997, the Institute had split from the Maudsley and become instead a school of King's College London. The Henry Wellcome building was opened in 2001 and houses most of the IoPPN's psychology department. In 2004, a new Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences (CNS) was opened which provides offices, lab space, and access to two MRI scanners for neuroimaging research. In 2014 the Institute was renamed to the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), as the remit of the Institute was broadened to include all brain and behavioural sciences. Departments Many of the departments' staff also work in Bethlem Royal Hospital. =Addictions= The Addictions Department specialises in research into tobacco, alcohol and opiate addiction policy and treatment. In March 2010 the addiction research unit and the sections of alcohol research, tobacco research and behavioral pharmacology were brought together to form the current The Addictions Department, also known as the National Addiction Centre (NAC). =Biostatistics= This department provides advice in the interpretation and use of statistical techniques in psychological research. They work closely with members of the Neuroimaging section in their work using brain scanners. The Biostatistics department opened in 1964, then as the Biometrics Unit. The department holds particular expertise in multivariate statistical methods for measurement, life-course epidemiology and the analysis of experimental, genetic and neuropsychiatric data. The department provides both introductory and advanced training in applied statistical methodology, collaborate on studies of mental health based here and internationally, and undertake research in relevant applied methodology. The department also hosts the UKCRN accredited King's Clinical Trials Unit which provides randomisation, data management, analysis and trial management - all of which are available to researchers across King's Health Partners. The CTU provides support to both medicinal and non-medicinal clinical trials assisting researchers in the conduct of carrying out clinical trials. =Child and Adolescent Psychiatry= The department is dedicated to the study of developmental disorders such as ADHD, clinical depression, autism and learning difficulties. The department has close links with the Michael Rutter Centre for Children and Young People at the Maudsley Hospital which has a number of specialist services for children and adolescents. =Forensic Mental Health Science= Forensic Mental Health Science is the study of antisocial, violent, and criminal behaviours among people with mental disorders. The department's research focuses on antisocial behaviour as it appears in people with either major mental disorders or personality disorders. The department is closely allied to the Forensic Psychiatry Teaching Unit. =Neuroscience= Researchers in this department carry out a range of studies into diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and motor neuron disease. The Institute of Psychiatry now houses the Medical Research Council Centre for Neurodegeneration Research, where pioneering research is conducted investigating disease of the CNS. The Department of Clinical Neuroscience in Windsor Walk also contains the MRC London Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank. =Department of Neuroimaging and Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences= The Maudsley Hospital is the site of the Institute's Clinical Neuroimaging Department. The Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences (CNS) is a joint venture of the King's College London Institute of Psychiatry and the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLAM). Completed in early 2004, the centre provides an interdisciplinary research environment. The Clinical Neuroimaging Department, situated at the Maudsley Hospital, provides a full range of neuroradiographic imaging services, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Within the CNS, the academic Department of Neuroimaging's Major Research Facility (MRF) manages a range of MRI facilities for research studies. The Department of Neuroimaging also runs an EEG laboratory, re-launched in 2010. =Psychology= Entrance to the Henry Wellcome Psychology Building The IoPPN Psychology department was founded in 1950. The department conducts research in neuropsychology, forensic psychology, and cognitive behavioural therapy. Hans Eysenck set up the UK's first qualification in clinical psychology in the department, which has now evolved into a three-year doctoral 'DClinPsych' qualification. Clinically, members of the department offer expert services to the Maudsley Hospital, Bethlem Royal Hospital, King's College Hospital, Guy's Hospital and community mental health teams in the South London area. Members of the department also teach psychology to undergraduate medical students from the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals. Psychiatric geneticist Peter McGuffin was awarded a fellowship at the Institute. =Psychological Medicine= The Department of Psychological Medicine, chaired by Professor Ulrike Schmidt, addresses many of the commonest mental disorders which affect adults including depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, somatoform disorders, and medically unexplained symptoms and syndromes. Its research spans basic science, experimental medicine, epidemiology and public policy. It includes the King's Centre for Military Health Research, led by the Department's former chair, Professor Simon Wessely, and is responsible for studying the psychological impacts of the 2003 Iraq War. The department also contains a programme of work on liaison psychiatry and studies the many complex interactions between mental and physical illness. =Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry= Entrance to the SGDP building The SGDP centre is a multi-disciplinary research centre devoted to the study of the interplay between ‚Äúnature‚Äù (genetics) and ‚Äúnurture‚Äù (environment) as they interact in the development of complex human behaviour. Research at the SGDP acknowledges that there is no simple solution to the \\"nature versus nurture\\" debate; instead, expertise is combined across fields such as social epidemiology, child and adult psychiatry, developmental psychopathology, development in the family, personality traits, cognitive abilities, statistical genetics, and molecular genetics. In this way it is hoped that a greater understanding can be achieved in risk factors that might predispose an individual to depression, ADHD, or autism. History The MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP) Centre was founded in 1994 by the Medical Research Council, in partnership with the Institute of Psychiatry (now a school of King‚Äôs College London). The research in social, genetic and developmental psychiatry have already existed at the Institute of Psychiatry since its establishment in 1948. However, the streams of research were not integrated and there have even been times when genetic researchers and social psychiatrists were in a state of hostility. The intellectual warfare between nature and nurture reached its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. Aubrey Lewis, who was the first Professor of Psychiatry at the Institute and the director of the MRC Social Psychiatry Research Unit (first MRC unit at the Institute), noticed that social psychiatry was a broad field that included both biological substrate of disorders and social causes. Eliot Slater, the ‚Äòfounding father‚Äô of psychiatric genetics in the United Kingdom, was encouraged by Lewis to study genetics in 1930s. In 1959, Slater established another MRC unit at the Institute (MRC Psychiatric Genetics Unit), but the unit was closed in 1969 on Slater‚Äôs retirement. In 1984, MRC Child Psychiatry Unit was established at the Institute of Psychiatry by Michael Rutter, a member in the MRC Social Psychiatry Research Unit led by Lewis. The unit brought together experts in many overlapping fields, and the mix proved highly successful as the unit had a major impact on child psychiatric research throughout the world. The MRC Social Psychiatry Research Unit was closed in 1993. The MRC and the Institute found that there was a need for refocusing and reintegration with other strands of research including psychiatric genetics and disorders of adult life. Rutter and David Goldberg discussed with the MRC about the establishment of an interdisciplinary research centre that could comprehensively study the interplay of nature and nurture in the development of psychiatric disorders. In 1994, MRC SGDP Centre was established in Denmark Hill, and Rutter was appointed as the first Director of the centre. The SGDP Centre has moved into its new purpose-built building in 2002. =Psychosis Studies= The department is the most highly cited group of scientists working on schizophrenia and related disorders. Work focuses on integrating cognitive measures and multimodal neuroimaging techniques, with perinatal, genetic and developmental data. The central aim is to characterize the core pathophysiological dimensions of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The section has initiated or participated a number of such treatment studies of new atypical antipsychotics and potential mood stabilising medication and is also developing computerised and web-based applications for disease self-management. =Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute= Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute The Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute is a centre for neuroscience research opened by The Princess Royal in 2015. It is one of the leading neuroscience institutes in the world. The centre is named after British philanthropist Maurice Wohl, who supported many medical projects and had a long association with King‚Äôs College London, and was funded by several philanthropic donors, organisations and King's Health Partners. The Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute focuses on the development of new treatments to patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, Parkinson‚Äôs disease and motor neurone disease), mental disorders (depression, schizophrenia) and neurological diseases (including epilepsy and stroke), and the understanding of disease mechanisms. The research institute has 250 clinicians and research scientists from neuroimaging, neurology, psychiatry, genetics, molecular and cellular biology and drug discovery. The current three major goals of the institute is to determine the underlying genetic and environmental risk factors for disease, to identify tests for early diagnosis and biomarkers that measure disease progression, and to develop informative cellular and animal disease models of disease to accelerate drug discovery. Funding Approximately 70% of the IoPPN's income comes from the research it conducts. Approximately 20% is from clinical work performed for the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Approximately 10% of gross income is from taught courses offered to postgraduate students. Sources include the government's National Institute for Health Research and Higher Education Funding Council for England, grant-giving bodies such as the Medical Research Council (UK) and the Wellcome Trust, as well as other governmental, charitable and private-sector organisations. Individual research teams secure around ¬£130 million of funds for their projects each year. Many projects are carried out in partnership with other university and health services, charities and private companies. The IoPPN and the pharmaceutical company Lundbeck are led one of the largest ever academic- industry collaborations in research, known as NEWMEDS - Novel Methods leading to New Medications in Depression and Schizophrenia. The project is part of the Innovative Medicines Initiative developed by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations and the European Commission. NEWMEDS aims to facilitate the development of new psychiatric medications by bringing top scientists and academics together in partnership with nearly every major global drug company. Another key project is the KCL and Janssen led pre competitive public private consortium RADAR-CNShttps://www.radar- cns.org (Remote Measurement of Disease and Relapse in Central Nervous System Disorders), which uses smartphones and wearable devices to track clinical outcomes in disorders like depression, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy.

He was also capped once for England. Club career Sunderland was born in Conisbrough, Yorkshire, and began his career at Wolverhampton Wanderers as an apprentice who played as a midfielder. With the Wolves he won the 1974 League Cup in a 2‚Äì1 win over Manchester City in the final at Wembley. Sunderland also went on to win the Second Division title in 1977 with the Wanderers. Altogether he made just under 200 appearances and scored a sum of 30 goals for the Midlands side. In November 1977, he joined Arsenal for ¬£220,000. Whilst at Highbury he switched from being within the role of a midfielder to that of a centre forward. Sunderland became a regular starter for the club, playing in the 1978 FA Cup Final, which Arsenal lost to Ipswich Town. Sunderland's most famous moment came in the 1979 FA Cup Final. During the game Arsenal had gone 2‚Äì0 up against Manchester United, with goals from Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton, and looked set for victory with only five minutes remaining. However, United scored twice in three minutes, with goals from Gordon McQueen and Sammy McIlroy, and extra time loomed. In the very last minute of the match, however, Arsenal pushed forward in a desperate counter- attack. Liam Brady fed Graham Rix on the left wing, and his cross was converted by Sunderland at the far post to make the score 3‚Äì2, and win Arsenal the cup. Sunderland stayed at Arsenal for another five years, forming an impressive partnership with Frank Stapleton for two seasons. He was the club's top scorer in 1979‚Äì80 together with 1981‚Äì82, and featured in the Arsenal sides that lost the 1980 FA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup finals. However, after a spate of injuries and the arrivals of Tony Woodcock and Charlie Nicholas, he thus found himself out of the first team. Sunderland eventually left Arsenal after netting 92 goals from 281 appearances for the Gooners. He went on then joining Ipswich Town on loan in February 1984. He helped them to avoid relegation from the First Division, and made the move permanent later in the summer. He played for Ipswich until 1986, then had a brief stint at Irish club Derry City, before retiring. Personal life Following retirement, he opened a pub in Ipswich. He eventually emigrated to Malta where he coached Birkirkara F.C. based within the town of Birkirkara. International career Sunderland won a single England cap which came in a 2‚Äì1 friendly win over Australia in Sydney on 31 May 1980, and also represented his country at under-21 (as an over-age player), under-23 and 'B' team level.

In addition to the competitive sports, TUL focuses on youth activities and youth education as well as offering activities regardless of age, gender, ethnicity or financial means. TUL is one of the member associations of the Finnish Olympic Committee. TUL is affiliated with the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions as well as the Social Democratic Party of Finland and Left Alliance. It is also a member of the International Labour Sports Federation (CSIT). TUL currently has more than 280,000 members, active in 1,000 clubs in 59 different sports.  History  A postage stamp celebrating the 1946 Federation Festival = Early years = After the 1918 Finnish Civil War, the Finnish Gymnastics and Sports Federation (SVUL) dismissed all clubs and athletes who had participated the war on the Red side. In 26 January 1919, 56 labour movement related clubs founded the new workers' sports central association Finnish Workers' Sports Federation (Suomen Ty√∂v√§en Urheiluliitto, TUL). During the first year, a 78 newly established clubs joined the federation, and by the end of 1919, TUL had about 10,000 members. In the next decade, the number rose up to 450 clubs with approximately 35,000 individual members. The establishment of TUL led into a dispersion in the Finnish sports as there was no cooperation between TUL and SVUL. Both associations created their own practise and competition systems, the Finnish championship titles were decided by SVUL athletes as TUL had own championships. Also the Finnish national teams were composed of SVUL athletes only. In 1920, TUL was a founding member of the Socialist Workers' Sport International and later had also relations with the Red Sport International. Instead of the ‚Ä≥bourguoise‚Ä≥ Olympic Games, the TUL athletes participated the Workers' Olympiads and the Spartakiads. In 1921, TUL sent a team to the Workers' Sports Festival in Prague, and in September 1922, the Finnish Workers' Sports Federation football team toured Soviet Russia. This was also the first international contact for Soviet sports after the 1917 October Revolution. = Anti-Communist suppression = Since the founding of TUL, the Social Democrats and Communists struggled for power inside the federation. Finally in 1927, the Social Democrats gained majority, and TUL denied all contacts with the Soviet led Red Sport International. Eighty clubs still sent athletes to the 1928 winter and summer Spartakiads in Oslo and Moscow. This ended up to the dismiss of 80 clubs in the fall of 1929, and the Communist-led clubs established a shortly-lived central organization Ty√∂l√§isurheilun Yhten√§isyyskomitea (The Unification Committee of the Labour Sports), launched in December 1929. At the same time, fascism reached foothold in the Finnish society. In 1930, the Parliament of Finland passed the anti-Communist laws, hundreds of organizations and newspapers that were considered as communist were banned. Among these organizations were 147 TUL member associations. For example, Finland's second largest sports club, Jyry Helsinki, was disbanded. The banned clubs were not able to re-organize until the end of World War II. Since 1932, TUL also lost its governmental grants for two years. = Period of cooperation = During the 1920s and the 1930s, more than 70 top athletes defected from the TUL clubs in order to compete in the Olympics. Between 1920 and 1936, 34 former TUL athletes participated the Olympic Games, 15 of them won a total of 23 medals. Since the early 1930s, 13 former TUL footballers were selected to the Finnish national football team. After the 1936 Berlin Olympics, TUL and SVUL launched negotiations of cooperation as Helsinki was elected to host the 1940 Summer Olympics. Finally, in 1939 the parties signed a cooperation agreement. The TUL and SVUL athletes competed together for the first time in June 1939 as the TUL and Finnish Football Association teams played against each other at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. The 1940 Summer Olympics were soon postponed due to the World War II, but TUL and SVUL continued their cooperation through the 1940s. In 1948, TUL athletes participated the Olympic Games for the first time, winning three medals, including one gold. The 37-year fragmented period finally came to an end in 1956, as the TUL and FA football series were merged. = Post-war years = In 1959, TUL split due to the internal dispute among the Social Democrats. The minority led by Emil Skog left the party, which also dispersed TUL. The Skog supporters formed the Ty√∂v√§en Urheiluseurojen Keskusliitto (The Central Organization of the Labour Sports Associations), which was active until 1979, although Emil Skog himself returned the party in 1964. The dispute also caused that TUL athlete were not send to the 1960 Olympics. Despite the cooperation, the political debates between TUL and SVUL survived even to the 1990s. The number of individual members in TUL peaked at 380,000 in the early 1980s. In 2001, TUL had 337,000 members.  Festivals and Sports academy  The ‚Ä≥Federation Festivals‚Ä≥ (Liittojuhlat) were launched in 1927 and have been arranged 12 times since. The largest festival with up to 36,000 participants was held in 1946. The TUL sports academy Kisakeskus was opened in Raseborg in 1958.

Built from red and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers. The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur. He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace. It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five floor exterior is akin to honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework. The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules of \\"purdah\\", which forbade them from appearing in public without face coverings. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer. Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back. In 2006, renovation works on the Mahal were undertaken, after a gap of 50 years, to give a facelift to the monument at an estimated cost of Rs 4.568 million. The corporate sector lent a hand to preserve the historical monuments of Jaipur and the Unit Trust of India has adopted Hawa Mahal to maintain it. The palace is an extended part of a huge complex. The stone-carved screens, small casements, and arched roofs are some of the features of this popular tourist spot. The monument also has delicately modeled hanging cornices.  Architecture  This palace is a five-story pyramidal shaped monument that rises to about . The top three floors of the structure have the width of a single room, while the first and second floors have patios in front of them. The front elevation, as seen from the street, is like a honeycomb with small portholes. Each porthole has miniature windows and carved sandstone grills, finials and domes. It gives the appearance of a mass of semi-octagonal bays, giving the monument its unique fa√ßade. The inner face on the back side of the building consists of chambers built with pillars and corridors with minimal ornamentation, and reach up to the top floor. The interior of the palace has been described as \\"having rooms of different coloured marbles, relieved by inlaid panels or gilding; while fountains adorn the centre of the courtyard\\". Lal Chand Ustad was the architect. Built-in red and pink colored sandstone, in keeping with the d√©cor of the other monuments in the city, its color is a full testimony to the epithet of \\"Pink City\\" given to Jaipur. Its fa√ßade with 953 niches with intricately carved jharokhas (some are made of wood) is a stark contrast to the plain-looking rear side of the structure. Its cultural and architectural heritage is a reflection of a fusion of Hindu Rajput architecture and Islamic Mughal architecture; the Rajput style is seen in the form of domed canopies, fluted pillars, lotus, and floral patterns, and the Islamic style as evident in its stone inlay filigree work and arches (as distinguished from its similarity with the Panch Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri). The entry to the Hawa Mahal from the city palace side is through an imperial door. It opens into a large courtyard, which has double-storeyed buildings on three sides, with the Hawa Mahal enclosing it on the east side. An archaeological museum is also housed in this courtyard. Hawa Mahal was also known as the chef-d'≈ìuvre of Maharaja Jai Singh as it was his favourite resort because of the elegance and built-in interior of the Mahal. The cooling effect in the chambers, provided by the breeze passing through the small windows of the fa√ßade, was enhanced by the fountains provided at the center of each of the chambers. The top two floors of the Hawa Mahal are accessed only through ramps. The Mahal is maintained by the archaeological department of the Government of Rajasthan.

It was written between December 1933 and February 1934 in Lowestoft, using bits of score that the composer had written for the piano as a young teenager, between 1923 and 1926. It was composed for string orchestra and received its first performance in 1934 at Stuart Hall in Norwich, with Britten conducting an amateur orchestra. The piece is dedicated to Audrey Alston (Mrs Lincolne Sutton), Britten's viola teacher during his childhood. The piece is based on eight themes which Britten wrote during his childhood (two per movement) and for which he had a particular fondness. He completed his final draft of this piece at age twenty. Instrumentation *1st violin *2nd violin *Viola *Cello *Contrabass *Piano Borrowed Themes within Movements It has four movements, each quoting themes from 2 earlier works by Britten: :I. Boisterous Bourr√©e ::‚Äì Suite No. 1 in E for piano (18 October 1925), second movement (Bourr√©e: Allegro vivace) ::‚Äì Song (Song) (1923) A Country Dance ('Now the King is home again'), text from Tennyson's The Foresters, for voice and piano. :II.

Frolicsome Finale ::‚Äì Piano Sonata No. 9 (1926) Piano Sonata No. 9, in C minor, op. 38, Finale ::‚Äì Song (1925) Eight main themes appear in the symphony, with two movements, the most famous is the pizzicato. The entire pieces last about 20 minutes. The second movement is popular with mandolin players as it is pizzicato. Prominent in this popular theme is 8 notes which sound familiar as echoing the opening of \\"Barwick Green\\" the theme music to the long-running BBC Radio 4 everyday story of country folk, \\"The Archers\\", written in 1924 by Arthur Wood. The third movement samples a traditional Swedish melody heard also in the popular Christian hymn ‚ÄúHow Great Thou Art‚Äù. Later uses In 1944, the choreographer Walter Gore created a ballet also entitled Simple Symphony for the Ballet Rambert. Many themes of the symphony are also used for the soundtrack Bad Blood (1986) by Leos Carax. It appears in Wes Anderson's film Moonrise Kingdom (2012), which prominently features many pieces by Britten. It also appears in the first two seasons of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (2017-2018).

History The apogee of the genre was the late 1960s and early 1970s, corresponding roughly to the chancellorship of Willy Brandt, but these films continued to be produced up to about 1980. Today they live on as staples of late night European cable and satellite channels. Among the directors working in this genre were Franz Antel (Liebe durch die Hintert√ºr, 1969; Das Love- Hotel in Tirol, 1978), Franz Marischka (Liebesgr√º√üe aus der Lederhose, 1973; Zwei D√§ninnen in Lederhosen, 1979; Three Lederhosen in St. Tropez, 1980), Franz-Josef Gottlieb (No Sin on the Alpine Pastures, 1974), Alois Brummer (Beim Jodeln juckt die Lederhose, 1974), and Hubert Frank (Jagdrevier der scharfen Gemsen, 1975). Alois Brummer was the producer of many of these films. Being the owner of two cinemas, he became interested in films and filmmaking and thought he could make a director and producer himself. After some \\"Report\\" movies (so-called documentaries about \\"German housewives\\" or \\"schools for girls\\", as a reaction to serious documentaries about sexual items in Germany's late 60's) he became involved in the series as mentioned above. These were mainly situated in the Alps. Director Franz Marischka got the idea by a newspaper article in 1972 about wealthy female tourists in Bavaria who tried to seduce local young men or the landlord of the inn where they were staying (and paid them for it). Marischka was inspired and set himself to make films about the subject. Therefore, the Alps were chosen as background. Bavarian porn films were usually set in Bavaria (Bayern) or Tyrol (Tirol). At that time most German film studios were located in Munich. This was somewhat ironic, considering the fact that Bavaria has been one of the more culturally and socially conservative areas of Germany, and has been run by the Christian Social Union almost continuously since 1947. Not a few of those movies are of Austrian origin, since many of them take place in Tyrol. At the time, Bavarian porn seemed outrageous and shocking to the older generation, who had been instilled with the family values of the National Socialist regime, not to mention traditional German sexual morality. To the baby-boomers who came of age after World War II, the films embodied the freedom and liberation brought about through the Sexual Revolution. Today, these films are revered more for their camp value than any ability to cause sexual arousal. Their legacy is most evident in the poppy acid-jazz soundtracks used in these films, which became popular among hipsters during the late 1990s, along with the resurgence of space age pop. Gert Wilden composed and performed many Bavarian porn soundtracks with his orchestra. Some Bavarian porn films were dubbed into English by German actors and actresses speaking English. The poor translations, \\"Godzilla-style\\" dub quality, and German accents elevate the camp factor of these films to a level beyond that of the German originals. Bavarian porn was released in the United States under titles such as Naughty Co-Eds, 2069: A Sex Odyssey, and The Sinful Bed.

It is a fictional story about attempts by aircraft designers and test pilots to break the sound barrier. It was David Lean's third and final film with his wife Ann Todd, but it was his first for Alexander Korda's London Films, following the break-up of Cineguild. The Sound Barrier stars Ralph Richardson, Ann Todd, and Nigel Patrick. The Sound Barrier was a box-office success on first release, but it has become one of the least- known of Lean's films. Following on In Which We Serve (1942), the film is another of Lean's ventures into a genre of filmmaking where impressions of documentary film are created.Pratley 19874, p. 106. Plot After his aircraft company's groundbreaking work on jet engine technology in the Second World War, John Ridgefield (Ralph Richardson), its wealthy owner, employs test pilot Tony Garthwaite (Nigel Patrick), a successful wartime fighter pilot to fly new jet-powered aircraft. Garthwaite is hired by Ridgefield after marrying Ridgefield's daughter, Susan (Ann Todd). Tensions between father and daughter are accentuated by Garthwaite's dangerous job of test flying. In a noteworthy illustration of the new technology, Susan accompanies Garthwaite on a ferrying assignment of a two-seater de Havilland Vampire to Cairo, Egypt, returning later the same day as passengers on a de Havilland Comet. Ridgefield's plan for his new jet fighter, \\"Prometheus\\", has placed the company in jeopardy. The problems faced by the new jet aircraft in encountering the speed of sound, the so-called \\"sound barrier\\", are ever present. In an attempt to break the sound barrier, Garthwaite crashes and is killed. Shocked at both the death of her husband and at her father's apparently single-minded and heartless approach to the dangers his test pilots face, Susan walks out on her father and goes to live with friends Jess (Dinah Sheridan) and Philip Peel (John Justin), another company test pilot. Ridgefield later engages Peel to take on the challenge of piloting \\"Prometheus\\" at speeds approaching the speed of sound. In a crucial flight and at the critical moment, Peel performs a counterintuitive action (foreshadowed in the opening scene of the film) which enables him to maintain control of the aircraft and to break the sound barrier. Eventually accepting that her father did care about those whose lives were lost in tests, Susan changes her plan of moving to London and takes her young son with her back to live with Sir John.

David Lean had begun to gather research based on media reports of jet aircraft approaching supersonic speeds, interviewing British aeronautic designers. He even managed to fly with test pilots as he produced a 300-page notebook that he turned over to dramatist Terence Rattigan.Pendo 1985, pp. 133, 135. The subsequent screenplay concentrated on the newly discovered problems of flying at supersonic speeds and is also loosely based on the real-life story of aircraft designer Geoffrey de Havilland and the loss of his son. Geoffrey de Havilland, Jr. was the de Havilland company test pilot who died on 27 September 1946 attempting to fly faster than the speed of sound in the DH 108.Davenport-Hines, Richard. \\"Havilland, Sir Geoffrey de (1882‚Äì1965)\\".

Contrary to what is depicted in the film, the first aircraft to break the sound barrier was the rocket-powered Bell X-1 flown by Chuck Yeager of the United States Air Force in 1947.

Official name Although the town is referred to locally as 1770 using numerals, the official name of the town is in words Seventeen Seventy, as it is a principle of Queensland's place naming that numbers are spelled out. Geography The village is a tourist destination on Queensland's Discovery Coast. It is situated on a peninsula, with the Coral Sea and Bustard Bay on three sides. Agnes Water is eight kilometres (five miles) to the south. The village itself contains holiday accommodation, restaurants, general store, hotel, picnic areas with free barbecues and a small marina where daily trips depart for Lady Musgrave Island on the Great Barrier Reef, and several trips a week to Bustard Head Light Station. Seventeen Seventy can be reached by a sealed road from Bundaberg, to the south, going through Agnes Water. The town sustains a small permanent population; a significant holiday population makes it to the area to take advantage of fishing, Great Barrier Reef trips and other water activities. The area also has four national parks. These are Deepwater, Eurimbula, Mount Colosseum, and Round Hill. These all offer wilderness camping and hiking. History At the the town of Seventeen Seventy had a population of 76 people. Tourism The area's wildlife and vegetation have been preserved as far as possible, and this, together with the area's natural environment, and an outer surf and inner still water beach, is a tourist attraction. There are also day cruises and flights to the outer Great Barrier Reef, to nearby Lady Musgrave Island and Pancake Creek, and the nearby Bustard Head lighthouse.

He worked from the early 1820s until the 1850s, using Classical, Italianate and Gothic styles. Life The Corridor in Bath (1825) He was born in Bath in 1797 the son of James Goodridge, who was at that time was engaged in large speculative building projects in connection with the management of the estate of Sir William Pulteney, at Bathwick. On the advice of Thomas Telford, his father had him articled to John Lowder, then the City Architect for Bath. Having set up his own practice, his early work consisted mostly of alterations, laying out blocks for building, and designing villas. He converted the Old Orchard Street Theatre into a Catholic church. His first important work was the enlargement of the Roman Catholic Downside College, (1821-3) near Bath, parts of which were praised by Pugin. His work there included the vaulted Gothic chapel, which was originally heavily pinnacled. In 1824 he built Christ Church at Rode Hill, also in Gothic style,Little 1947, p.127 and the next year he acted both as developer and architect on the \\"Corridor\\" in Bath. In 1827 he finished the Cleveland Bridge over the Avon in Bath, a cast iron structure, with Doric lodges. He later built the Public Dispensary nearby, using the Ionic order.Little 1947, p.121 In 1829 he visited Italy, where he sketched buildings assiduously. In 1834 he made a grand design for a church in connection with the Roman Catholic College at Prior Park. It was never carried out, and a chapel on a smaller scale was later built by J.J. Scoles. Goodridge did, however, build the processional stairway in front of the mansion, and also made some internal alterations which were obliterated by fire in 1836.Little 1947, p.125 He designed the tower at Lansdown for William Beckford, who had recently sold Fonthill Abbey, and moved to a house in Lansdown Crescent in Bath. Beckford obtained designs from several London and Bath architects, including Goodridge, who was chosen after some prevarication. New designs were drawn up, and the tower completed up to the level of the block cornice in 28 working days. It was intended to be roofed at this point, but Beckford decided it should be increased in height with a belvedere, and then decided on an additional lantern. According to a brief biography of Goodridge, written by his son: > In style [the tower] may be termed Greco-Italian, a style Goodridge greatly > adopted, as he considered therein the purity of the Greek and the freedom of > the Romanesque were best combined. After Beckford's death, the tower and grounds became a cemetery, for which Goodridge designed a gateway and wing walls in a Byzantine style. At around this time he was employed by Beckford's son-in-law the Duke of Hamilton at Hamilton Palace, in the finishing of the grand staircase and hall, and in building the Beckford library there. He also made a design for a mausoleum, which was originally intended to be built adjoining the palace. The Duke, however, changed his mind, and decided to build it some distance away in the park. Goodridge made several designs for the new situation, but his client thought them too extravagant, and Goodridge only built the burial vaults of the new structure, the chapel above being entrusted to another architect. He entered the competition to design the new Houses of Parliament, and was appointed to the committee to choose designs for the decoration of Parliament when an exhibition was held for the purpose at Westminster Hall. During the construction of the Great Western Railway through Bath, his services were secured by Brunel to purchase the land and settle the various claims. During part of his career he did a great deal of this kind of work. His last works before his retirement were the alteration and enlargement of Ecclescrieg, Kincardineshire, for Forsyth Grant, and the Percy Chapel, Bath, (1854), another Byantine design.Little 1947, p.136 on which he worked with his son, A. S. Goodridge. Harvey Lonsdale Elmes and W.H. Campbell were his pupils. Personal life Goodridge maintained a financial interest in The Corridor and, a few years after the death of his widow, his will led to a family dispute which had to be resolved by the Chancery Court. He was buried in Lansdown Cemetery, which surrounds Beckford's Tower. Works Goodridge's buildings in Bath include: * The Corridor, one of the earliest shopping arcades (1824). * Cleveland Bridge (1827). * Combe Down church (1832‚Äì5) * Beckford's Tower, commissioned by the eccentric William Beckford and now owned by the Bath Preservation Trust and operated as a museum. * The Byzantine gateway to the cemetery adjacent to Beckford's Tower in which William Beckford's sarcophagus stands. * Several Italianate villas on Bathwick Hill including his own house, Bathwick Grange, which was formerly known as Montebello. * Work at Prior Park, including the processional stairway.

He played for New South Wales in the first match run by the newly created 'New South Wales Rugby Football League' which had just split away from the established New South Wales Rugby Football Union. Messenger had a stocky build, and while standing only about in height, he was a powerful runner of the ball and a solid defender. According to his peers, the centre's greatest attributes were his unpredictability and astonishing physical co-ordination, coupled with a freakish ability to kick goals from almost any part of the ground. He was a teetotaller and non-smoker during his career and other than breakfast, Messenger would rarely eat before a match. Early life Messenger was born in the Sydney waterfront suburb of Balmain, New South Wales, and grew up in another of Sydney's waterfront suburbs, Double Bay, where his father, Charles Amos Messenger, a champion sculler, owned a boat shed. He also spent some time living with an aunt in South Melbourne, Victoria where he attended the Albert Park Public School. It was there he recalled playing Victorian rules football. He credited skills he learned at Albert Park as contributing to his later success at Rugby Union and Rugby League.Dally was one of eight children. His younger brother by seven years, Walter (Wally) also became an Australian representative footballer. In Sydney, Messenger attended Double Bay Public School in the city's eastern suburbs. It was here that he initially honed his rugby skills, while also playing cricket and indulging in his other great sporting love, sailing. Messenger worked, too, at his father's boat shed. By this juncture, he had gained the nickname of \\"Dally\\". It derived from a prominent politician of the 1880s, the then Attorney-General of New South Wales, William Bede Dalley, whose most conspicuous physical feature was a splendid pot belly ‚Äì an anatomical augmentation that Herbert Henry Messenger happened to boast, too, when he was a small child. Fortunately, little Herbert Henry shed his pot belly as he grew older, together with the \\"e\\" from the spelling of his nickname. Messenger first took up competitive rugby in 1900, playing for a local rugby union club called the Warrigals in a semi-social club competition.  Rugby union  Over the next few years Messenger continued to play with the Warrigals, persistently rejecting calls by officials of the Eastern Suburbs RUFC to move up to the higher standard of Sydney's grade competition. In 1905 he finally began playing for Easts in the club's second-grade team, but showed sufficient promise to earn promotion to the first-grade side on two occasions that season. In that same season, he also purportedly played Australian rules football club in a number of first- grade matches in the Sydney competition. 1907-08 All Blacks (All Golds) tour Messenger began the 1906 season in first grade with Easts as a 'standoff' (five-eighth). He swiftly won a following amongst the club's supporters due to his mesmeric ball skills, cheeky tricks, blistering acceleration and accurate short- and long-kicking game off either foot. Messenger moved to what would become his customary position of centre following his selection there for the New South Wales team in 1906. By the time of his Wallaby debut in 1907, he had made that position his own. In the book Viewless Winds, the 1906 representative footballer Paddy Moran wrote that Messenger's play \\"was full of surprises, unorthodox, flash\\" and \\"directed largely by the unconscious mind\\". He said that Messenger \\"never became a slave to copybook practices\\" because his \\"instinct enabled him to see and take an opening in that operative second which is all-important\\". Moran compared him to Bradman in terms of their mutual ability to instantaneously co-ordinate their bodies into the right position in apparently ample time before the ball would arrive.Moran, Herbert (1939) Viewless Winds When talk of a professional rugby competition, or a Rugby League, was being aired, Messenger was instantly interested by the development. He was approached by a consortium that included Test cricketer, Victor Trumper with friend J. J. Giltinan, who knew getting Messenger on board would be a major boost for the new code. He signed on with the new professional code in 1907. As the premier rugby footballer of the time, Messenger's signing is considered an integral moment in the foundation of rugby league.Australian Dictionary of Biography \\"Dally Messenger\\" After he became a professional rugby league footballer, Messenger's rugby games were struck from the record books of the New South Wales Rugby Union and not restored for 100 years.\\"Dally Messenger reinstated to NSWRU record books\\" Rugby league Dally Messenger 1908 Civic Reception Scroll. It contains the words \\"When we review the names of the Athletic Champions produced by New South Wales in the cricket, rowing, swimming and boxing world we feel that no name has added more glory to the fame of our country than your own\\". Messenger played in the rebel series against a professional New Zealand team, the 'All Golds' as they were referred to, and was invited to tour England with the New Zealand professional side. It remains unclear whether this was a result of the form he showed in the series or if it had been agreed on as part of his sign- on fee with the new code. It was said, and believed as Messenger family folklore for years, that the signing of Messenger to rugby league was negotiated with Dally's mother Annie, and the promised amount for playing, at first, in three All Golds' games, was 50 pounds (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately ¬£18,210 in 2015). It was in the North of England that Messenger became more acquainted with the new game. By the completion of the tour Messenger had topped the tour aggregates by more than 100 points. On arrival back in Australia, Dally played with the Eastern Suburbs club of the newly formed New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL), although a heavy representative schedule saw him play only a handful of matches for the club. Messenger's popularity helped showcase the new game and the NSWRFL took full advantage of this. He was selected to play in the first ever trans-Tasman test, which was the debut match of the Australia national rugby league team. In rugby league's first year, besides playing for his club, Messenger made representative appearances for Metropolis (Sydney), NSW and Australia as well as for New Zealand and, in one case, Queensland, he also represented Australasia. Following two heavy defeats, Messenger agreed to play for Queensland in a third match against New Zealand. The match ended in a 22 all draw with Messenger scoring nine of the 22 points. Dally (3rd row left of suited Giltinan) Pioneer Kangaroos 1908‚Äì09 Towards the end of the 1908 season Messenger was again selected to tour England, this time with the first Kangaroos, or 'Pioneers'. Having toured with the New Zealand professional team the previous year, Messenger was well known in the North of England and on arrival attained celebrity status. Placards bearing the words 'Messenger Will Play' were erected outside of grounds. Messenger was offered contracts by leading soccer clubs, including Glasgow Celtic, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, but refused them. Messenger captained Australia in the first two tests of the tour, missing the third through a knee injury incurred after regular field goal attempts. On tour Messenger was credited with numerous goals from the other side of half way, including one from the sideline on his own 25-yard line that appeared in earlier versions of the 'Guinness Book of World Records' as measuring over 80 yards (73m). Another from over 75 yards is mentioned in an English newspaper under the heading 'A Wonderful Kick' \\". > \\" Quite a sensation was caused at last Saturday's football match when Mr > Messenger kicked the ball from the 75 yards' mark and secured a goal.....\\" In the second test Messenger is said to have scored one of the greatest individual tries ever witnessed in Test rugby league. At the end of the tour Messenger had again topped the aggregates, this time by just under 100 points. Returning home from the tour with injury and following a hectic schedule over the past few years, he elected to sit out most of the 1909 season, playing in just a few representative matches towards the end of the year. Messenger also rejected an offer to play with English club, Warrington, during the Australian off-season that year. Messenger was captain of Australia when they hosted the 1910 Great Britain Lions tourists. Messenger inside Dan Frawley in action for NSW v Qld 1912 The 1911 season has been acclaimed as Messenger's greatest. In 21 matches played he amassed a then record total of 270 points. In one interstate match for NSW he scored 32 points (from four tries and 10 goals). That record has only been equalled in recent years, with tries now being worth 4 points as opposed to 3. He amassed a total of 72 points for the three match series. Recently married Messenger stood down from the 1911‚Äì12 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, leading his club Eastern Suburbs to its first premiership. In the semi-final that year against South Sydney Messenger scored 20 of Easts' 23 points. For each of the three consecutive seasons 1910, 1911 and 1912 he was the NSW Rugby Football League's top point scorer. In 1911 he overtook Arthur Conlin's record for the most points scored in an NSWRFL (101); Messenger's eventual total of 379 stood as the new career record until it was bettered by Harold Horder in 1918. After retirement from representative football, he led his side to a second premiership in 1912 and followed that with a third consecutive premiership in 1913. Easts were given permanent possession of the NSWRFL's first trophy, the Royal Agricultural Society Shield. On announcement of his retirement, the Eastern Suburbs club presented the shield to Messenger in appreciation. He was awarded Life Membership of the New South Wales Rugby League in 1914.Referee, Sydney Life Members of the NSWRFL - 13 May 1914, (Page 12) Dally Messenger is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 10. Life after football In addition to his rugby prowess, Messenger was a talented cricketer, canoeist and sailor. After the end of his rugby league career, he ran a couple of hotels in Sydney and Manilla, New South Wales and a banana plantation in Mount Buderim, Queensland. He later worked as a carpenter in the NSW Department of Public Works. None of his various business opportunities proved to be successful. In his later years, he lived in the New South Wales Rugby Leagues Club in Phillip Street.

Biography Berg started his musical education at the age of six when he began studying classical piano. He began playing the saxophone at the age of thirteen. He studied at the High School of Performing Arts and Juilliard before leaving school to tour. Berg was influenced by the late 1964‚Äì67 period of John Coltrane's music. A student from the hard bop school, Berg played from 1973 to 1976 with Horace Silver and from 1977 to 1983 with Cedar Walton. Berg became more widely known when he joined Miles Davis band in 1984. After leaving Davis's band in 1987, Berg released a series of solo albums and also performed and recorded frequently in a group co-led with guitarist Mike Stern. On these albums he played a more accessible style of music, mixing funk, jazz and even country music with many other diverse compositional elements to produce albums. He often played at the 7th Avenue South NYC club. He worked with Chick Corea, Steve Gadd and Eddie G√≥mez in a quartet. Berg's tenor saxophone sound was a synthesis of rhythm and blues players such as Junior Walker and Arnett Cobb with the lyricism, intellectual freedom and soul of Wayne Shorter, Joe Henderson and John Coltrane. Berg was killed in a traffic accident in East Hampton, New York, while driving near his home with his wife. The person who crashed into his car was driving a cement truck that skidded on ice.

The house was built in 1892 and is located off Trevenna Road on the western side of the main campus in Armidale. There is no public access to the property or gardens, but the gardens have been open for public viewing, on several occasions in recent years. History Designed by Canadian-born, Boston-trained architect, John Horbury Hunt (1838‚Äì1904), Trevenna was originally the home of the Wrights, a prominent New England family of graziers. It was originally built for Mrs Eliza Jane Wright. The homestead and its grounds were bequeathed to UNE as the Vice-Chancellor's residence in 1960 by Mrs Florence May Wilson. The Vice- Chancellors who have resided at Trevenna are: *Sir Robert Madgwick (1962‚Äì1966) *Sir Zelman Cowen (1966‚Äì1970) *Alec Lazenby (1970‚Äì1977) *Professor Ronald Gates (1977‚Äì1985) *Professor Lawrence W Nicol (1985‚Äì1988) *Professor Don McNicol (1988‚Äì1990) *Professor Robert HT Smith (1990‚Äì1994) *Professor Bruce Thom (1994‚Äì1996) *Professor Ingrid Moses (1997‚Äì2006) *Professor Alan Pettigrew (2006‚Äì2009) *Professor James Barber (2010‚Äì2014) *Professor Annabelle Duncan (2014-2019) *Professor Brigid Heywood (2019-) Grounds The house itself comprises three storeys and features an imposing main entrance on the southern side. Some of the trees in its garden, including horse chestnuts, pines and planes, date back to the 1890s when Trevenna was built. The garden is constructed on several levels. A sunken garden, complete with stone sundial and fish pond, is on one side of the house, while on the other a series of hedges encloses a private lawn. The grounds also feature a gardener's shed, the smaller Trevenna Cottage, and a clay tennis court. They also include a herb garden and orchard and numerous dry-stone walls, some of which have been overplanted with ivy hedges. A private gravel road of 300 metres, lined with pines and lamp posts on either side, leads off Trevenna Road and winds through parklands up to the house. The front garden slopes away into a series of hedges and wide perennial borders lead the eye across the Bellevue area of the University with the city of Armidale and Mount Duval in the distance.

Principii del diritto politico, 1798 (Milano, Fondazione Mansutti). Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (; 24 June or 13 July 1694 ‚Äì 3 April 1748) was a Genevan legal and political theorist who popularised a number of ideas propounded by other thinkers. Life Born in Geneva, Republic of Geneva, into a Calvinist family (descended from the wealthy 16th- century Italian merchant Francesco BurlamacchiBurlamaqui-Burlamacchi patronymic derived from Buglione http://marcosfilgueira.wikidot.com/ascendencia-pela-familia-burlamaqui from the Latin word bulla http://www.myetymology.com/italian/buglione.html for seal of Papal document; meaning to boil, bubble of Lucca executed for his Republican sentiments) who had taken refuge religionis causa, he studied law and at 25 he was designated honorary professor of ethics and the law of nature at the university of Geneva. Before taking up the appointment, he travelled through France and England, and made the acquaintance of the most eminent writers of the period. On his return he began to lecture and soon gained a wide reputation for the simplicity of his style and the precision of his views. He continued to lecture for 15 years, when he was compelled on ill health to resign. His fellow citizens at once elected him a member of the council of state, and he gained as high a reputation for his practical sagacity as he had for his theoretical knowledge. He died in Geneva. Works His works were Principes du droit naturel (1747) and Principes du droit politique (1751). These have passed through many editions, and were very extensively used as textbooks. Burlamaqui's style is simple and clear, and his arrangement of the material good. His fundamental principle may be described as rational utilitarianism and represents a digest of the thoughts of like- minded theorists, particularly Richard Cumberland and Hugo Grotius. Burlamaqui's treatise The Principles of Natural and Politic Law was translated into six languages (besides the original French) in 60 editions. His vision of constitutionalism had a major influence on the American Founding Fathers: \\"Early American thought also drew on ideas circulating on the Continent. The author who played the greatest part in transmitting those ideas over the Atlantic was the Swiss writer Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui, now almost forgotten, but at one time a best-selling author.\\". See also U.S. Department of State: Hillary Rodham Clinton, Secretary of State: \\"America's Founders were inspired by the ideas and values of early Swiss philosophers like Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui and Emer de Vattel, and the 1848 Swiss Constitution was influenced by our own U.S. Constitution. Swiss commitment to democracy is an example for nations and people everywhere who yearn for greater freedoms and human rights.\\" For example, his understanding of checks and balances was much more sophisticated and practical than that of Montesquieu, in part because Burlamaqui's theory contained the seed of judicial review. He was frequently quoted or paraphrased, only sometimes attributed, in political sermons during the pre-revolutionary era. He was the first philosopher to articulate the quest for happiness as a natural right, a principle that Thomas Jefferson later restated in the Declaration of Independence. Burlamaqui's description of European countries as forming \\"a kind of republic the members of which, independent but bound by common interest, come together to maintain order and liberty\\" is quoted by Michel Foucault in his 1978 lectures at the Coll√®ge de France in the context of a discussion of diplomacy and the law of nations.M.

Sawn lath became popular after the introduction of the circular saw in the 19th century.

Types of Lath Riven lath, each piece has been split from a log = Wooden Lath = Wooden-slat laths are still used today in building construction to form a base or groundwork for plaster, but modern lath and plaster applications are mostly limited to conservation projects. Tiles, slates, and other coverings on roofs and walls are often fastened to laths, sometimes also called battens or slats. Such strips of wood are also employed to form lattice-work, or are used as the bars of Venetian blinds, and window shutters.[citation needed] Lath is also used on many tobacco farms in the Connecticut Valley as a means to carry and hang the plant in barns. This is achieved by using one of two methods: hooking or spearing. A \\"spear\\" lath is a regular lath that is held in an upright position. A worker then mounts a spear on top and \\"spears\\" the tobacco onto the lath. The other form of lath is called \\"hook\\" lath, which has small hooks attached that allows workers to hook the stems of tobacco plants onto the lath, often between two lengths of twine attached to the lath and twisted mechanically.[citation needed] A lathhouse is an open structure roofed with laths in order to grow plants which need shelter from the sun. Laths were also used to fix reeds to a timber structure before plastering.[clarification needed] In Cape Cod, laths were used in the early 1880s for building wooden lobster traps. Historically there were three ways of making wood lath for plaster: riven lath, accordion lath, and circular sawn lath. Riven lath was traditionally split with the grain from chestnut, oak, and similar hardwoods, or from softwoods like eastern white pine. Individual laths were riven and nailed in place. Because they are split with the grain, riven lath is stronger than later forms of lath production. Accordion laths are thin, sawn boards that are partially split with a hatchet or axe. The splits are then spread apart to form gaps for the plaster to key into. The name derived from the spreading action, which is like pulling an accordion open. After the circular saw came into use in the early 19th century, lath for plastering was sawn in sawmills and delivered to the building site.[citation needed] =Counter-lath= Counter-lath is a term used in roofing and plastering for a piece of wood placed perpendicular to the lath. In roofing, a counter-lath is a slight piece of timber parallel with and between common rafters to give the lath extra support, or a lath placed by eye between every two gauged ones.\\"Counter-lath\\" def. 1.b.Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) ¬© Oxford University Press 2009 When plastering, sometimes a counter-lath is placed perpendicular to the lath as a fillet (a thin, narrow strip of material) to space the lath off of the surface to allow the plaster to pass through the lath and create a key. =Metal lath= Bostwick Steel Lath Company advertisement for steel truss loop type metal lath in 1920Metal lath dates from the late 19th century and is used extensively today with plaster and stucco in home and commercial construction. In addition to providing a matrix to which the stucco can adhere, metal lath adds strength and rigidity. [citation needed] . Metal lath can be stapled directly to studs, and is capable of bending to easily form corners and curves. Three coats of plaster are required when using metal lath. Several types of metal lath have been developed for a variety of applications: * Expanded metal lath is made by slitting and pulling apart a thin sheet of metal, which produces diamond-shape holes through which the plaster can form keys. * Ribbed lath is made from slit and expanded metal with V-shaped ribs which give it more stiffness, and is designed to span larger distance between framing supports * Self-furring lath is an expanded metal lath which is dimpled to hold itself off from a solid surface * Wire lath is made from welded or woven wires and is similar to hardware cloth * Paper backed wire lath is wire lath with building paper attached * Strip laths is metal lath that is several inches wide and is often used to reinforce joints and on corners * Corner lath is pre-bent for use in making corners * Wire mesh used on inside corners to prevent cracking is called Cornerite. = Gypsum lath = Gypsum lath (rock lath) consists of gypsum plaster sandwiched between two sheets of absorbent paper. The finish side (to which plaster is trawled) is treated with gypsum crystals for the plaster to chemically bond to and is sometimes perforated to allow mechanical bonding.[citation needed] It was commonly used in place of wood lath since it is noncombustible, easy to use, and can give better results.[citation needed] Gypsum board can be purchased in sheets of various sizes and screwed or nailed directly onto a building's studs. Due to its rigidity, it is most suited for use on straight walls. Gypsum board was improved in 1910 by the paper wrapping the edges[1] accessed 1/11/2014 and multiple variations were developed in the 1930s. Gypsum lath is available with a foil facing, which acts as a vapor barrier and heat reflector, and as a veneer base for plaster veneer.  Keys  Keys are formed by plaster that oozes through the spaces or gaps between wooden lath, or the holes in metal lath, and around to the lath's backside. This secures the plaster to the lath by creating a sort of hook. Wooden and metal lath depend on the mechanical bond created by keys to adhere the plaster to the lath.  Framing  Lath can be attached directly to the frame of a building, such as the studs of a timber structure. Alternatively, lath can be attached to a timber or metal frame called a furring, which is then attached to the building structure. Furrings are often used in masonry construction. Frames are also used when using lath and plaster to create decorative, curved, or ornamental work.United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bulletin of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1980.  Lath failure  Lath with sections of failing and failed sections There are several reasons that a plaster and lath wall may fail. First, the lath itself can sometimes pull away from the frame on which it is mounted. This is generally due to the use of non-galvanized nails. The lath can also fail because of decay from moisture or insect damage. Moisture can also cause wooden lath to expand and contract, causing the plaster around it to crack. Additionally, failure can also occur in the plaster keys. Over time, the keys can deteriorate and crack, weakening their ability to hold the plaster onto the lath. The addition of hair in plaster helps to prevent this by adding strength. Problems can also occur in the keys if they were not properly formed to begin with, which can happen when laths are set too close together for plaster to travel though. Key failure often manifests as looseness and sagging in walls or ceilings, and in worst cases can lead to plaster breakage and collapse. = Repair methods = Repairing damaged lath and plaster walls is generally more economical than replacing it. Often, the plaster needs the repairs, and not the lath itself. As long as the lath and the first coats (brown coat) of plaster do not have any significant damage, minor cracks can simply be patched. For larger cracks, and when the brown coat is damaged, several base coats need to be applied prior to the patch coat. Metal lath can also be added to wooden lath prior to coating to add strength and increase keying. If the backside of the lath is accessible, it is possible to create new keys where they have failed. This is most often done by conservators when one wants to maintain the original finished surface of the wall or ceiling. After bracing the failing plaster in place, a bonding agent and a plaster are applied to the back of the laths and forced through the gaps to the backside of the original plaster.  Benefits of lath  Lath and plaster walls have several benefits, including fire and mold resistance, soundproofing, and heat insulation. Though wooden lath can be susceptible to mold growth and decay, metal lath covered in plaster creates an environment that is inhospitable to toxic molds. Metal lath and plaster walls can be twice as resistant to fire than drywall, and are capable of achieving a two-hour fire rating with a assembly. 2 inches of plaster and lath can also achieve the same decibel rating as of drywall.

By late 1937, he had designed, built, and successfully tested both a semi-automatic rifle and a prototype light machine gun. Each shared a significant number of physical characteristics and common parts, and both operated on the principle of short recoil with a rotating bolt. He took the parts of other guns, switching them out and creating the M1941 light machine gun. Johnson's curved, single-column magazine attached to the left side of the receiver; company brochures list a 20-round magazine as standard. Additionally, the weapon could be loaded by stripper clip at the ejection port, or by single rounds fed into the breech. The rate of fire was adjustable, from 200 to 600 rounds per minute. Two versions were built: the M1941 with a wooden stock and a metal bipod, and the M1944 with a tubular steel butt and a wooden monopod. The design intended the recoil forces to travel, along with the mass of the weapon's moving parts, in a direct line to the shoulder of the gunner. While this design minimized muzzle climb, the sights had to be placed higher above the bore. Johnson LMG in use The weapon has many parallels with the German FG 42. Both feed from the left side, and both fire from an open bolt while in automatic, and a closed bolt while in semi-auto. Both weapons were awkward to carry loaded, with a side-mounted magazine; the Johnson had an especially lengthy single-column magazine, and this feature tended to unbalance the weapon. Despite these similarities, there is no evidence that either weapon had any effect on the design of the other. Both weapons attempted to solve similar problems, and adopted similar solutions. Prototypes of semi-automatic rifles, 20-round magazine-fed, based on the Johnson LMG were also produced. The M1947 Johnson auto carbine is an example. A belt fed variant also existed.  Users  Johnson sold small quantities of the Johnson LMG to the U.S. Army and Marine Corps.Pikula, Sam (Maj.), The Armalite AR-10, 1998 During the Second World War, Special Forces within the Allies demanded a more portable, lighter, more accurate automatic rifle that provided the equivalent stopping power of the American BAR. As a result, this machine gun was adapted as the BAR replacement for commandos operating behind Axis lines. The First Special Service Force, raised jointly with men from both Canada and the United States (the famous Devil's Brigade), traded the Marine Corps 125 of the new Johnson light machine guns for plastic explosives. They were used in lieu of BARs, but as they wore out and were lost in combat they were replaced by BARs. The Johnson LMG was used by the Philippine Army and Philippine Constabulary during World War II under the Japanese Military Occupation from 1942 to 1945 and post-war from 1945 to 1960s including during the Hukbalahap Rebellion (1946-1954) and by the Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea or PEFTOK (1950-1955). Shortly after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the predecessor of the Israel Defense Forces, Haganah, developed a close copy of the Johnson LMG, the Dror, in both .303 British and 7.92√ó57mm Mauser. Israeli forces found the Dror prone to jam from sand and dust ingress, and the weapon was discontinued after a brief period of service. Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara notably used a Johnson in the Cuban Revolution.  Aftermath  Melvin Johnson continued to develop small arms. In 1955, he was asked to assist Fairchild/ArmaLite in (unsuccessfully) promoting Eugene Stoner's AR-10 rifle with the U.S. Department of Defense, then with ArmaLite and Colt's Manufacturing Company as an advocate for the AR-15. Armalite relied heavily on Johnson's efforts and the AR-15 used a similar bolt design to the M1941 Johnson. The AR-15 is still produced today by numerous manufacturers, as is its derivative, the M16 rifle. One of Johnson's last postwar firearms ventures was a 5.7 mm-caliber version of the M1 carbine, aka 'the Spitfire'.Barnes, Frank C., Cartridges of the World, DBI Books, 1989  Users  *: Known to be used by Canadian soldiers in the Special Service Forcehttps://www.forgottenweapons.com/james-d-julia-johnson-lmg-history- disassembly/ *: Formerly used by the Royal Malaysian Police, now on display at the Police Museum.http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/royal-malaysia-police- museum/  =Non-state actors= * 26th of July Movement  See also  *Sturmgewehr 52 *Kg/1940 Light machine gun *FG 42 *Furrer M25 *List of individual weapons of the U.S. Armed Forces *M60 machine gun *Model 45A *M1946 Sieg automatic rifle *MG 30 *TRW Low Maintenance Rifle  Notes   Books and References  *Johnson Jr., Melvin, Rifles and Machine Guns of the World's Armies, Fighting Forces, 1944. *Smith, Joseph E., Small Arms of the World, Stackpole Books, 1969. *Weeks, John, WWII Small Arms, Galahad Books, 1980. *Barnes, Frank C., Cartridges of the World, DBI Books, 1989. *Pikula, Sam (Maj.), The Armalite AR-10, 1998. *Canfield, Bruce N., Johnson Rifles and Machine Guns, Mowbray Publishing, 2002.

Decanters, which have a varied shape and design, have been traditionally made from glass or crystal. Their volume is usually equivalent to one standard bottle of wine (0.75 litre). A carafe, which is also traditionally used for serving alcoholic beverages, is similar in design to a decanter but is not supplied with a stopper. History Free-blown, wheel-cut carafes. First half of 11th century. Excavated at Teppe Madraseh, Neishapur, Iran. New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. Throughout the history of wine, decanters have played a significant role in the serving of wine. The vessels would be filled with wine from amphoras and brought to the table where they could be more easily handled by a single servant. The Ancient Romans pioneered the use of glass as a material. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, glass production became scarce causing the majority of decanters to be made of bronze, silver, gold, or earthenware. The Venetians reintroduced glass decanters during the Renaissance period and pioneered the style of a long slender neck that opens to a wide body, increasing the exposed surface area of the wine, allowing it to react with air. In the 1730s, British glass makers introduced the stopper to limit exposure to air. Since then, there has been little change to the basic design of the decanter. Although conceived for wine, other alcoholic beverages, such as cognac or single malt Scotch whisky, are often stored and served in stoppered decanters. Certain cognacs and malt whiskies are sold in decanters such as the 50-year-old single malt Dalmore or the Bowmore Distillery 22 Year Old. Decanting process Liquid from another vessel is poured into the decanter in order to separate a small volume of liquid, containing the sediment, from a larger volume of \\"clear\\" liquid, which is free of such. In the process, the sediment is left in the original vessel, and the clear liquid is transferred to the decanter. This is analogous to racking, but performed just before serving. Decanters have been used for serving wines that are laden with sediments in the original bottle. These sediments could be the result of a very old wine or one that was not filtered or clarified during the winemaking process. In most modern winemaking, the need to decant for this purpose has been significantly reduced, because many wines no longer produce a significant amount of sediment as they age. Decanting cradles A decanting machine Baskets called decanting cradles, usually made of wicker or metal, are used to decant bottles that have been stored on their side without needing to turn them upright, thereby stirring up sediment. These are particularly useful in restaurants, for service of a wine ordered during a meal, but less important at home, where a bottle can be stood upright the day before. More complicated s also exist to facilitate smoothly pouring, without disturbing sediment. Aeration Another reason for decanting wine is to aerate it, or allow it to \\"breathe\\". The decanter is meant to mimic the effects of swirling the wine glass to stimulate the oxidation processes which triggers the release of more aromatic compounds. In addition it is thought to benefit the wine by smoothing some of the harsher aspects of the wine (like tannins or potential wine faults like mercaptans). Many wine writers, such as author Karen MacNeil in the book The Wine Bible, advocate decanting for the purposes of aeration, especially with very tannic wines like Barolo, Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon, Port, and Rh√¥ne wines while noting that decanting could be harmful for more delicate wines like Chianti and Pinot noir. However, the effectiveness of decanting is a topic of debate, with some wine experts such as oenologist √âmile Peynaud claiming that the prolonged exposure to oxygen actually diffuses and dissipates more aroma compounds than it stimulates, in contrast to the effects of the smaller scale exposure and immediate release that swirling the wine in a drinker's glass has. In addition it has been reported that the process of decanting over a period of a few hours does not have the effect of softening tannins. The softening of tannins occurs during the winemaking and oak aging when tannins go through a process of polymerization that can last days or weeks; decanting merely alters the perception of sulfites and other chemical compounds in the wine through oxidation, which can give some drinkers the sense of softer tannins in the wine. In line with the view that decanting can dissipate aromas, wine expert Kerin O'Keefe prefers to let the wine evolve slowly and naturally in the bottle, by uncorking it a few hours ahead, a practice suggested by wine producers such as Bartolo Mascarello and Franco Biondi Santi. Other wine experts, such as writer Jancis Robinson, tout the aesthetic value of using a decanter, especially one with an elegant design and made with clear glass, and believe that for all but the most fragile of wines that there is not much significant damage to the wine by decanting it. A decanter can also be used to present wine anonymously.

Historically, this rod was implanted along the spinal column to treat, among other conditions, a lateral or coronal-plane curvature of the spine, or scoliosis. Up to one million people had Harrington rods implanted for scoliosis between the early 1960s and the late 1990s.  History  The Harrington implant was developed in 1953 by Paul Harrington, a professor of orthopedic surgery at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Harrington rods were intended to provide a means to reduce the curvature and to provide more stability to a spinal fusion. Before the Harrington rod was invented, scoliosis patients had their spines fused without any instrumentation to support it; such fusions required many months in plaster casts, and large curvatures could progress despite fusion.  Purpose  Harrington rod instrumentation was used to treat instability and deformity of the spine. Instability occurs when the spine no longer maintains its normal shape during movement. Such instability results in nerve damage, spinal deformities, and disabling pain. Spinal deformities may be caused by birth defects, fractures, marfan syndrome, neurofibromatosis, neuromuscular diseases, severe injuries, and tumors. By far, the most common use for the Harrington rod was in the treatment of scoliosis, for which it was invented.  Description  The device itself was a stainless steel distraction rod fitted with hooks at both ends and a ratchet and was implanted through an extensive posterior spinal approach, the hooks being secured onto the vertebral laminae. It was used at the beginning without performing a spinal fusion but early results proved fusion as part of the procedure was mandatory, as movement of the unfused spine would cause the metal to fatigue and eventually break. The procedure required the use of a postoperative plaster cast or bracing until vertebral fusion had occurred. Flatback syndrome Flatback syndrome is a problem that develops in some patients treated with Harrington rod instrumentation, where the rod extends down into lower part of the lumbar spine. Because the Harrington cannot follow the natural lordosis of the lower back (i.e. the backwaist curve), the spine is straightened out into an unnatural position. At first, the unfused spinal segments compensate for the straightening effects, but eventually the discs degenerate and wear down. The patient then develops back pain, has difficulty standing upright, and experiences limitations when walking. Eventually, the problem requires surgery to realign the spine. As exemplified by Pecina and Dapic in the European Spine Journal (February 2007), flatback syndrome is not inevitable and does not happen to every person with a low Harrington rod instrumented fusionthere are many people who have had Harrington rods for decades with no adverse effects.

Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35 (1988), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the warrantless search and seizure of garbage left for collection outside the curtilage of a home.  Background  In early 1984, Investigator Jenny Stracner of the Laguna Beach Police Department learned from various sources that Billy Greenwood might be selling illegal drugs out of his single-family home. In April, Stracner asked the neighborhood's regular trash collector to pick up the plastic garbage bags that Greenwood left on the curb in front of his house. In the garbage, she found evidence of drug use. She used that information to obtain a warrant to search Greenwood's home. When officers searched the house, they found cocaine and marijuana. Greenwood and Dyanne Van Houten were arrested and released on bail. In May, another investigator again had the garbage collectors pick up the garbage bag left on the curb. The garbage again contained evidence of drugs, the police obtained another search warrant, and they found more drugs and evidence of drug trafficking in the house. The California Superior Court dismissed the charges against Greenwood and Van Houten on the ground that unwarranted trash searches violated the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment, as well as the California Constitution. The Court of Appeal affirmed. The Supreme Court of California refused to hear the appeal. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the judgment of the California Court of Appeal.  Opinion of the Court  By a 6‚Äì2 vote (Justice Kennedy took no part in the case), the Court held that under the Fourth Amendment, no warrant was necessary to search the trash because Greenwood had no reasonable expectation of privacy in it. Although Greenwood had hidden the trash from view by putting it in opaque plastic bags and expected it to be on the street only a short time before it would be taken to the dump, the Court believed it to be ‚Äúcommon knowledge‚Äù that garbage at the side of the street is ‚Äúreadily accessible to animals, children, scavengers, snoops, and other members of the public.‚Äù Moreover, Greenwood had left the trash there expressly so that the trash collector, a stranger, could take it. Quoting Katz v. United States, the court concluded that \\"[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\\" Greenwood argued that the evidence should be excluded under the California Constitution, which the California Supreme Court had interpreted to prohibit warrantless searches of garbage left at the curb (People v. Krivda, 1971). However, the Constitution had been amended in 1982 by the passage of Proposition 8, also known as the \\"Victims' Bill of Rights.\\" One of its provisions, the Truth-in-Evidence Act, eliminated the exclusionary rule for unconstitutionally obtained evidence. The Court rejected Greenwood's claim that the amendment violated the Due Process Clause. It held that so long as the police conduct did not violate federal law, \\"California could permissibly conclude that the benefits of excluding relevant evidence of criminal activity do not outweigh the costs.\\" Dissent Justice Brennan reasoned that the possibility the police or other ‚Äúunwelcome meddlers‚Äù might rummage through the trash bags ‚Äúdoes not negate the expectation of privacy in their contents any more than the possibility of a burglary negates an expectation of privacy in the home.‚Äù Under United States v. Chadwick, the bags could not have been searched without a warrant had Greenwood been carrying them in public. Merely leaving them on the curb for the garbage man to collect, Brennan argued, should not be found to remove that expectation of privacy, for ‚Äúscrutiny of another's trash is contrary to commonly accepted notions of civilized behavior.‚Äù See also * Florida v.

It has the second-largest number of ATMs (largely due to the vast nationwide presence of Bank of the Philippine Islands Express Teller ATMs) and the smallest number of customers and member banks. However, its strength among the interbank networks and the ubiquity of BPI ATMs have given birth to the Expressnet motto: \\"The Powerful Connection\\". At present, Expressnet has 3.5 million customers and has 2,213 ATMs operating 24 hours a day. It has been reported that lock, stock and barrel of Expressnet has been purchased by rival interbank network BancNet. The Expressnet brand is slowly being retired as a result, and recent BPI promotional collateral no longer shows Expressnet info and membership, particularly in their new releases of BPI Express Teller cards (where BPI no longer lists itself as a member of Expressnet). Full integration of its current infrastructure to the BancNet system is expected to be completed by mid-2016. History Expressnet was founded on February 14, 1986, when the ATMs of Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) and its subsidiary, BPI Family Savings Bank, were connected for the first time. The first Expressnet transaction was also conducted that same year. Soon thereafter, in December 1991, Landbank joined the consortium, followed by HSBC Philippines in February 1992. Banco de Oro joined in April 1995, BPI Direct Savings Bank (a BPI subsidiary), joined in 2000 and HSBC Savings Bank, an HSBC subsidiary, became the latest Expressnet member on April 1, 2001. Expressnet and another Philippine interbank network, MegaLink, formed an alliance on May 6, 1997, with the main ceremony held at Ayala Center. This meant that 2.3 million Expressnet cardholders could use their cards with MegaLink ATMs, and 2.7 million MegaLink cardholders could use their cards with Expressnet ATMs. On July 13, 2005, Expressnet and BancNet signed a memorandum by executives of both networks. At present, all Expressnet ATMs advertise full connectivity with BancNet ATM cards and that BancNet shall maintains Expressnet's facilities. Expressnet is also known for its Express Payment System (EPS), which was at first the debit card system of the BPI Express Teller ATM card. In 2005, the network expanded to include cardholders of all Landbank E.A.S.Y. (Express Access for Savers like You) and Banco de Oro (both local and international) ATM cards. Members Expressnet is the primary network of the following banks listed below: *Banco de Oro (formerly a member of MegaLink, now BancNet) - April 1995 *Bank of the Philippine Islands and subsidiaries BPI Direct Savings Bank and BPI Family Savings Bank (also a member of BancNet) - February 14, 1986 *Land Bank of the Philippines (now a member of BancNet) - December 1991 Connectivity All Expressnet ATM cardholders and a majority of Expressnet ATMs are connected to both MegaLink and BancNet, the other Philippine interbank networks. All Expressnet cardholders can access MegaLink and BancNet-connected ATMs and vice versa. However, not all Expressnet ATMs are linked to MegaLink and BancNet. Prominent examples of this include Landbank and HSBC, but the BPI group and Banco de Oro are accessible to MegaLink cardholders. An agreement was signed though between BancNet and Expressnet to interconnect. The first bank to make such an announcement about the BancNet-Expressnet tie-up was Chinabank, of which its sister bank, Banco de Oro, is a member of Expressnet. Internationally, Expressnet cardholders (excluding Landbank and local BPI and Banco de Oro cardholders) are connected to Maestro and Cirrus in the cases of BPI and Banco de Oro and PLUS. Expressnet ATMs link to the same with BDO ATMs also providing access to American Express, Japan Credit Bureau (JCB), MasterCard, VISA & Visa Electron cardholders.

In September 1982, President Reagan nominated Tomlinson to be his fourth Director of the Voice of America (VOA), where he served through August 1984.

The > editorials should reflect the viewpoint of the party in power.\\" In October 1986, President Reagan nominated Tomlinson to be the fourth chairman of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS), where he served until May 1987. In May 1987, President Reagan nominated Tomlinson to be a member of the Board for International Broadcasting (BIB) where he served until 1994 when the BIB was dissolved by the International Broadcasting Act of 1994 and replaced by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). Tomlinson became a close friend of Karl Rove while they served together on the BIB after President Bush nominated Rove to be a member of the BIB in 1989.Stephen Labaton; Steven R. Weisman, New York Times, \\"Spending Inquiry For Top Official On Broadcasting\\" (subscription needed) Following his work at VOA, Tomlinson returned to Reader's Digest as managing editor in 1984. He was named executive editor in 1985 and became editor-in- chief in 1989. Tomlinson was the Virginia Press Association's \\"Virginian of the Year\\" in 1994 and is a member of the Virginia Communications Hall of Fame. Tomlinson retired as editor-in-chief of Reader's Digest in 1996. After moving to Virginia soon after, Tomlinson was named president and director of the National Sporting Library in Middleburg, Virginia, in 1999. Tomlinson died of melanoma on May 1, 2014 at a Virginia hospital. CPB tenure Tomlinson was appointed as chairman of the CPB board by President George W. Bush, for a two- year term, in September 2003. He embarked upon a mission to purge CPB of what he perceived as \\"liberal bias\\".Paul Farhi, Washingtonpost.com, \\"A Different Reception For Public Broadcasting\\", May 20, 2005 His efforts sparked complaints of political pressure. Broadcasting & Cable magazine wrote when Tomlinson \\"uses terms like 'fair and balanced' in talking about what PBS should be, it is understandably seen as code guaranteed to evoke charges of the 'Foxification' of PBS and raise alarm bells with liberals and moderates, as well as with viewers who just don't care about a political agenda at all\\".staff, Broadcasting and Cable, \\"CPB Needs Uniter, Not Divider\\", June 24, 2005 Tomlinson commissioned a $10,000 study into Bill Moyers' PBS program, Now with Bill Moyers without informing the board of the investigation.Stephen Labaton, Lorne Manly AND Elizabeth Jensen, New York Times, \\"CHAIRMAN EXERTS PRESSURE ON PBS, ALLEGING BIASES\\", May 2, 2005 (subscription required) He also retained two Republican lobbyists to try to defeat a Congressional proposal that would have increased the representation of broadcasters on the board, again without informing the board of the contracts. The inspector general's report issued 15 November 2005, said that Tomlinson appeared to have violated both the federal law and the corporation's own rules in raising $5 million to underwrite The Journal Editorial Report, a PBS program by the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal.Stephen Labaton, New York Times, \\"Ex-Chairman of Public Broadcasting Violated Laws, Inquiry Suggests\\", November 16, 2005 (subscription required) Tomlinson, in a statement distributed with the report, rejected its conclusions. He said that any suggestion that he violated his duties or the law \\"is malicious and irresponsible\\" and that the inspector general had opted \\"for politics over good judgment\\". \\"Unfortunately, the Inspector General's preconceived and unjustified findings will only help to maintain the status quo and other reformers will be discouraged from seeking change\\", said Tomlinson, who has repeatedly defended his decisions as part of an effort to restore balance to programming. \\"Regrettably, as a result, balance and objectivity will not come soon to elements of public broadcasting\\".The New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/15/business/media/16cnd- broadcast.html?_r=1&scp;=1&sq;=%22kenneth%20tomlinson%22&st;=cse&oref;=slogin In April 2005, the contract of the former CPB president, Kathleen Cox, was not renewed. She was replaced by acting president Ken Feree, a Republican and former adviser to then-FCC chairman Michael Powell. Tomlinson resigned from the CPB board on November 4, 2005, after the board saw the report about his tenure by the Inspector General of the CPB, requested by House Democrats. The report described possible political influence on personnel decisions, including e-mail correspondence between Tomlinson and the White House which indicated that Tomlinson \\"was strongly motivated by political considerations in filling the president/CEO position\\", a position eventually filled by former Republican National Committee co-chair Patricia Harrison. Tomlinson was replaced by Cheryl Halpern. Harrison remains CPB president and CEO . Broadcasting Board of Governors tenure In July 2005, the State Department opened an inquiry into Tomlinson's work at the Broadcasting Board of Governors, after Representative Howard L. Berman, Representative Tom Lantos and Senator Christopher Dodd forwarded accusations of misuse of money from an employee at the board. The New York Times reported that the inquiry was pursuing accusations that Tomlinson had spent federal money for personal purposes and hired unqualified and ghost employees. It also reported that State Department investigators had seized records and e-mail from the board, including correspondence between Tomlinson and Karl Rove, one of President George W. Bush's senior advisors. Rove, an old friend of Tomlinson's, helped to secure Tomlinson's position as chairman. A summary of the year-long report, prepared by the inspector general of the State Department was released by Berman on August 29, 2006. It concludes that Tomlinson used his office at the Broadcasting Board of Governors to oversee a stable of thoroughbreds. Berman has asked that Tomlinson be removed from his position immediately in the light of the reports findings. In the statement issued through his lawyer, Tomlinson said that he was \\"proud of what I have accomplished for U.S. international broadcasting\\" and that the investigation \\"was inspired by partisan divisions inside the Broadcasting Board of Governors\\". He implied that it was more efficient for him to work for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting at his office at the broadcasting board. About his horse racing work, he said the inspector general had concluded that it amounted to \\"an average of one e-mail and two and a half minutes a day\\" at the office. He also said he spent more time on broadcasting responsibilities at his farm and residences than he spent on his horses at the office.The New York TImes https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/washington/30broadcast.html?scp=3&sq;=%22kenneth%20tomlinson%22&st;=cse In early September 2006, the BBG appointees voted on two resolutions related to the inspector general's report: whether to call for Tomlinson's resignation, and whether to sharply curtail his authority. Both resolutions failed in votes that split along the Governors' party lines.

Yabba was known for his knowledgeable witticisms shouted loudly from \\"The Hill\\", a grassy general admissions area of the SCG. In Yabba's era, cricket matches were watched like tennis matches, and spectators at the SCG were much quieter than today. This is the reason Yabba's comments were so clearly heard by players and other spectators. \\"The Hill\\" area was replaced with seating in the early 1990s. The new area was then formally named Yabba's Hill in honour of his colourful comments, several of which have passed into cricketing folklore. In 2007 the Doug Walters Stand and Yabba's Hill were demolished to make way for the new Victor Trumper Stand. On 7 December 2008 a bronze statue of Yabba, sculpted by Cathy Weiszmann, was unveiled at the Sydney Cricket Ground in The Hill area of the new stand. It depicts Yabba in a characteristic pose, one hand acting as a megaphone, in the act of delivering one of his famous interjections. Yabba was portrayed by Paul Chubb in the 1984 mini-series Bodyline.

As a comics artist he is best remembered for his newspaper comic Abie the Agent.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/herschfield_h.htm Biography He was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on October 13, 1885 to Jewish immigrants. He studied in Chicago at the Frank Holmes School of Illustration and the Chicago Art Institute. His career began at age 14, drawing sports cartoons and his comic strip about a dog, Homeless Hector, for the Chicago Daily News in 1899. He then went West, drawing for the San Francisco Chronicle by 1907. He married Sarah Jane Isdell (?-1960). In 1909, he was hired by Arthur Brisbane to work for William Randolph Hearst's New York Evening Journal. He switched to the New York Graphic where he drew If I'm Wrong, Sue Me!, and when the Graphic folded, he went to the New York Herald Tribune and drew Meyer the Buyer. During the 1930s, Hershfield was in demand as a banquet toastmaster, averaging some 200 banquets and dinners annually. During his lifetime, he was toastmaster or master of ceremonies at an estimated 16,000 events, including charity affairs, dinners and stage benefits. Involved in a legal battle with Hearst from 1933 to 1935, Hershfield drew a Sunday half-page, According to Hoyle, for the New York Herald-Tribune during those years. thumb On March 11, 1938, he was signed to manage the story department of MGM's cartoon studio.

Occasionally, he favored collages and sometimes made fun of other artists styles. In 1910, he started Desperate Desmond, a humorous continuity strip burlesquing melodramas, dime novels, and fiction weeklies that went in for the hairbreadth rescue and gloating villain sort of material. In addition to the villainous, top-hatted Desmond, the strip featured the stalwart Claude √âclair and the put-upon blond heroine, Rosamond. Hershfield's enthusiastic kidding of this sort of cliffhanger hokum did little to sour the public on its conventions. However, within a few years, such motion picture serials as The Exploits of Elaine and The Perils of Pauline would be attracting audiences to movie houses by doing the stuff completely straight. :In 1912, Hershfield switched heroes and introduced a new strip called Dauntless Durham of the U.S.A. Durham, a handsome, pipe-smoking combination of Sherlock Holmes, Nick Carter and Frank Merriwell, was the soul of honor and polite to a fault. The object of his affection was the beautiful Katrina. In 1914, Hershfield abandoned parody for a quieter sort of humor and created Abie the Agent. The strip continued until 1940 and dealt with contemporary Jewish life in a big city. Hershfield specialized in gags with a Yiddish flavor.Goulart, Ron. Encyclopedia of American Comics. New York: Facts on File, 1990.

The Hughligans were a group of backbench Conservative MPs who were dissatisfied with the leadership of Arthur Balfour. Cecil was a younger son of Balfour's predecessor as Conservative Leader, the Marquess of Salisbury. Besides Cecil, other members were F.E. Smith, Earl Percy, Arthur Stanley, Ian Malcolm and Lord George Hamilton. Winston Churchill was also associated with the group before his departure from the Conservative Party in 1904.

It was published in 1993. Plot introduction Its two main characters are Cameron Colley, a journalist on a Scottish newspaper called The Caledonian (which resembles The Scotsman), and a serial murderer whose identity is a mystery. The passages dealing with the journalist are written in the first person, and those dealing with the murderer in the second person, so the novel presents, in alternate chapters, an unusual example of an unreliable narrator. The events take place mostly in and around Edinburgh. Plot summary Colley is a \\"Gonzo journalist\\" with an amphetamine habit, living in Edinburgh. He also smokes cigarettes and cannabis, drinks copious amounts of alcohol, plays computer games, and has adventurous sex with a married woman, Yvonne. He regrets his addictions and misdemeanours and occasionally tries (admittedly half-heartedly) to give them up. He reflects on his awful experience of witnessing the aftermath of the massacre at the 'Highway of Death' in the Gulf War, and covers the deployment of HMS Vanguard, Britain's first Trident nuclear missile submarine. He thinks he has a scoop when he receives anonymous phone calls about a series of mysterious deaths. Suddenly he has mysterious deaths of his own to worry about, when an editorial he wrote years before comes back to haunt him. In it, he suggested that certain named capitalist and right-wing public figures would be better hate-figures than the conventional ones of foreign leaders or domestic criminals. It seems someone is killing off the people on his list, one by one. The description of the murders (which are ingeniously sadistic) is done in a fairly detailed manner. Under suspicion by the police, Colley finds himself involved doubly in the bizarre murders when the killer is revealed. At the end of the book, Colley is diagnosed with lung cancer (a downbeat ending omitted in the film adaptation). Literary significance & criticism Banks claimed in an interview that Complicity is \\"[a] bit like The Wasp Factory except without the happy ending and redeeming air of cheerfulness\\". The themes of violence and substance abuse in the book, along with the grim ending, seem to point to Banks' growing pacifism. Significant sections of the novel are written in second-person narrative. There are scenes in the book telling of the main character's time at university. While the university isn't named the description of the locale points very strongly at this being Stirling University, where Iain Banks was himself a student. Film adaptation A motion picture called Complicity (or Retribution in some markets) based on the novel was filmed in 2000.

The city is located at an elevation of 1,545 metres, 15 km from Lake Van, in the steep-sided valley of the Bitlis River, a tributary of the Tigris. The local economy is mainly based on agricultural products which include fruits, grain and tobacco. Industry is fairly limited, and deals mainly with leatherworking, manufacture of tobacco products as well as weaving and dyeing of coarse cloth. Bitlis is connected to other urban centres by road, including Tatvan on Lake Van, 25 km to the northeast, and the cities of Mu≈ü (Mush), 100 km northwest, and Diyarbakƒ±r, 200 km to the west. The climate of Bitlis can be harsh, with long winters and heavy snowfalls. Summers are hot, and often humid. Since the local elections of March 2019, the Mayor of Bitlis is Nesrullah Tanƒülay.  History  =Ancient and medieval= Two winged gods standing on lions are facing each other. The figures are identified as Tei≈üeba, the Storm God. 7th century BC. from Bitlis now in Museum of Anatolian Civilizations The origin of the name Bitlis is not known. A popular folk etymology explanation, without historical basis, is that it is derived from \\"Lis/Batlis\\", the name of a general said to have built Bitlis castle by the order of Alexander the Great. Anon. ¬´‘≤’°’≤’•’∑¬ª [Baghesh]. Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1976, vol. ii, pp. 254-256. To Armenians, it was known as Balalesa or Baghaghesh, and later Baghesh.Hewsen, Robert H. \\"The Historical Geography of Baghesh/Bitlis and Taron/Mush\\" in Armenian Baghesh/Bitlis and Taron/Mush. Richard G. Hovannisian (ed.) UCLA Armenian History and Culture Series: Historic Armenian Cities and Provinces, 2. Costa Mesa, California: Mazda Publishers, 2001, p. 52. According to one popular Armenian folk story, on a cold, wintry day a donkey left its stable and wandered down the valley below. The donkey died of the freezing temperatures and was only discovered in the spring, once the ice had melted; thus, it received the name Pagh Esh, or \\"Cold Donkey.\\" Baghesh was one of the most important cities of the Kingdom of Armenia's province of Aghdznik', and it served as the primary fortress of the province's canton of Salnodzor. Some medieval Armenian writers, such as Anania Shirakatsi and Vardan Areveltsi, later mention it as a part of the canton of Bznunik'. The fortress guarded the Baghesh Pass, which linked the southern reaches of the Armenian Plateau to northern Mesopotamia. The Arabs conquered Baghesh at the end of the seventh century and it eventually became the capital of the ZurƒÅrid emirs of Arzan. Because it was on an important trade route, it prospered greatly. The next two centuries, however, marked a turbulent period in the town's history. After Bugha al-Kabir's destructive 852-855 campaign in Armenia, the Shaybanid emirs wrested control of Baghesh from the ZurƒÅrids; thereafter, in the first quarter of the tenth century, it was taken by the Kaysite emirs of Manzikert. In his 929-30 campaign against the Kaysites, the Byzantine general John Curcuas was able to capture and annex Baghesh. Following the devastation of the Arab emirs in the second half of the tenth century, a great number of Kurds settled in Baghesh and at the end of the tenth century, the city fell into the hands of the Kurdish Marwanid dynasty after breaking from Buyid rule. At the end of the eleventh century, with the collapse of Byzantine power after the Battle of Manzikert, Bitlis fell under the control of Togan Arslan, a subject of the Shah Arman (Also called Ahlatshah) dynasty based in Akhlat' after brief Dilmachoglu rule. It was also ruled by Ayyubid (1207‚Äì1231), Khwarezm Shahs (shortly rule in 1230), Sultanate of R√ªm (1231‚Äì1243) and Ilkhanate (1243‚Äì1335). =Emirate= Bitlis Castle Bitlis was a Kurdish emirate from the 13th to the 19th century. Though often subordinate to a succession of larger powers that ruled the Van region, it always maintained a measure of independence. In the 14th century its emirs, the Kurdish Rusaki family, were vassals of the Karakoyunlu and the emirate's territory also consisted of several smaller emirates: Ahlat, Mush, and Hinis. The emir of Bitlis submitted to Timur in 1394, but later helped the re-establishment of Karakoyunlu control in the region. After the collapse of the Karakoyunlu state, the Bitlis emirate disintegrated. However, in the 1470s it took the Aq Qoyunlu (White Sheep Turkomans) three successive sieges to capture Bitlis and in 1494/95 the Ruzaki recaptured the town. Armenians formed a large part of the city's population. A number of monasteries were permitted to be built by the Kurdish emirs and during the fifteenth century, Biltis flourished as a center for Armenian manuscript production. Bitlis was forced to accept a Persian governor during the invasion of the Safavid Shah Ismail, but sided with the Ottoman forces as they approached the region. Its emir, Sheref, later changed his allegiance to the Persians. An Ottoman army besieged Bitlis for three months in 1531/32, but was forced to retire. Sheref was killed in battle in 1533 and his son and successor submitted to the Ottoman Empire. Mush and Hƒ±nƒ±s were removed from the Bitlis emirate, becoming separate sanjaks but still with Ruzaki beys. A Jesuit mission was established in Bitlis in 1685. The Ruzakid Kurdish dynasty in Bitlis lasted until 1849, when an Ottoman governor evicted its last emir, Sheref Bey, who was taken to Constantinople as a prisoner. After this, Bitlis was governed by a Turkish pasha and formed the capital of a vilayet bearing its name. =Modern= Ihasiye Serafhan Medrese In 1814 the population of Bitlis town was said to be 12,000 people - one half Muslim, the other half was constituted by Christian Armenians. By 1838 its population was said to be between 15,000 and 18,000 - two thirds Muslim, one third Armenian, and a small minority of Assyrians. In 1898 Lynch considered the population to be close to 30,000, comprising 10,000 Armenians, 300 [As]syrians, and the rest Muslim Kurds (both Alevis and Sunnis included). The Armenians had five schools for boys and three for girls. One third of the population of Bitlis was ethnic Armenian prior to World War I (1914, whereas the majority of the population was Kurdish Muslim (Alevi as well as Sunni Muslims). In 1915, during the Armenian Genocide, Turks and Kurds, led by Jevdet Bey Pasha, massacred some 15,000 Armenians in Bitlis.Walker, Christopher J. \\"The End of Armenian Taron and Baghesh, 1914-1916\\" in Armenian Baghesh/Bitlis and Taron/Mush, pp. 191-206. In February 1916, as part of the Caucasus Campaign, Imperial Russian forces launched an offensive to capture Mush and Bitlis. Mush fell on February 16. At Bitlis, the Turkish positions were in a strong location on the outskirts of the town and could not be outflanked because of the narrowness of the valley. On the night of March 2‚Äì3, during a blizzard, the Russian 8th Caucasian Rifles advanced silently and, after several hours of hand-to-hand fighting, took the Turkish positions with 1,000 prisoners. The Turks then abandoned Bitlis, retreating towards Siirt. The Russian forces and intelligence officers found evidence of the massacres of Christians by the Kurdish and Turkish radicals in 1915. In August 1916 the Turkish Second Army started an offensive against the Russian front in eastern Turkey. On August 2, the Ottoman 16th Corps, together with strong Kurdish irregulars' support, attacked Bitlis and Mush.William Edward David Allen, Paul Muratoff, Caucasian Battlefields: A History of the Wars on the Turco-Caucasian Border 1828-1921, (Cambridge University Press, 2010), 421-422. Fearing encirclement General Nazarbekov, the Russian commander, abandoned Bitlis on August 5. When Mush also fell, he decided to abandon Tatvan and the whole Mush valley and retreat to Ahlat. Around 18 August, the Russians having been reinforced, were able to counter-attack.Edward J. Erickson, Ordered to Die:A History of the Ottoman Army in the First World War, (Greenwood Press, 2001), 133. By September the Turkish offensive was stalled and then turned. Nazarbekov advanced as the Turkish forces withdrew from Tatvan and Mush, but he did not have the available forces to hold Bitlis as winter approached. The Russian February Revolution in the spring of 1917 prevented any further Russian gains. Description Bitlis preserves more medieval and traditional architecture than any other town in eastern Turkey. They are of a high quality and are mostly constructed from locally quarried light-brown stone, sometimes called Ahlat stone. The town contains a large number of late-medieval Islamic buildings in the form of mosques, madrassas, and tombs. Also commercial buildings such as \\"Han's Caravanserais. Commissioned mostly by its local Kurdish rulers, the architectural style of these buildings is very conservative and similar to much earlier Seljuq-period structures. Important monuments include the 12th-century Ulu Mosque with its 15th-century minaret, and the Gokmeydani Medresesi and Sherefiye Mosque from the sixteenth century. Until 1915 there were five Armenian monasteries and several churches in Bitlis ‚Äì only a 19th-century Armenian church survives, now used as a warehouse.Sinclair. Eastern Turkey, pp. 297-308. Bitlis is also notable for its many old houses. These are built of cut stone and are often large and impressive structures. Most have two stories, but three stories are also found. Ground floors were generally intended for storage and stables, with the residential quarters on the upper floors. Ground floor rooms have few windows, upper floors are well lit. Roofs are flat and covered with beaten clay. Unlike traditional houses in nearby Erzurum or Van, Bitlis houses do not have bay windows and balconies. Sayin, Y. Bitlis Evleri (The Homes in Bitlis).

Economy Historically, Bitlis produced wheat, which the British, in 1920, described as being \\"particularly excellent.\\" However, poor trade routes in the area during the early 20th century meant that the wheat was mainly produced and used by locals.

She ran the first school for black girls (\\"young Ladies and little Misses of color\\") in the United States. When Crandall admitted Sarah Harris, a 20-year-old African-American female student in 1832 to her school,Wormley, G. Smith.

Parents of the white children began to withdraw them. Prudence was a \\"very obstinate girl\\", according to her brother Reuben. Rather than ask the African-American student to leave, she decided that if white girls would not attend with the blacks, she would educate black girls. She was arrested and spent a night in jail. Soon the violence of the townspeople forced her to close the school and leave. Much later the Connecticut legislature, with lobbying from Mark Twain, a resident of Hartford, passed a resolution honoring Crandall and providing her with a pension. Twain offered to buy her former Canterbury home for her retirement, but she declined. She died a few years later, in 1890.  Early life  Prudence Crandall was born on September 3, 1803, to Pardon and Esther Carpenter Crandall, a Quaker couple who lived in Carpenter's Mills, Rhode Island. When she was about 10, her father moved the family to nearby Canterbury, Connecticut. As her father thought little of the local public school, he paid for her to attend the Black Hill Quaker School in Plainfield, east of Canterbury. Her teacher there, Rowland Greene, was opposed to slavery, and much later gave an address, published in Garrison's Liberator, on the necessity of education for blacks, and commended Isaac C. Glasgow for sending two of his daughters, \\"exemplary young women\\", to Crandall's school for young ladies of color. When 22, for one year she attended the New England Yearly Meeting School, a Quaker boarding school in Providence, Rhode Island. That the school existed was due to the generosity of Moses Brown, an abolitionist and co-founder of Brown University; in 1904 the school renamed itself the Moses Brown School. After graduating, Prudence Crandall taught a school in Plainfield.\\"The Drama of Prudence Crandall.\\" Prudence Crandall Collection, Box 3. Linda Lear Center for Special Collections & Archives, Connecticut College. She became a Baptist in 1830.  Establishment of the boarding school  In 1831 she purchased the Elisha Payne house, with her sister Almira Crandall, to establish the Canterbury Female Boarding School, at the request of Canterbury's aristocratic residents, to educate young girls in the town. With the help of her sister and a maid, she taught about forty children in different subjects including geography, history, grammar, arithmetic, reading, and writing. As principal of the female boarding school, Prudence Crandall was deemed successful in her ability to educate young girls, and the school flourished until September 1832.  Integration of the boarding school  Prudence Crandall Went to Prison for Teaching Colored Students. Although Prudence Crandall grew up as a North American Quaker, she admitted that she was not acquainted with many black people or abolitionists. She discovered the problems that plagued black people through the abolitionist newspaper The Liberator, which she learned of through her housekeeper, \\"a young black lady\\", whose fianc√© was the son of the paper's local agent. After reading The Liberator, Prudence Crandall said in an earlier account that she \\"contemplated for a while, the manner in which I might best serve the people of color.\\" Prudence Crandall's chance to help people of color came in the fall of 1832. Sarah Harris, the daughter of a free African-American farmer near Canterbury, asked to be accepted to the school to prepare for teaching other African Americans. Although Crandall was uncertain about whether to admit Harris, whom she liked, she consulted her Bible, which, as she told it, came open to Ecclesiastes 4:1: She then admitted the girl, establishing the first integrated school in the United States. Prominent townspeople objected and placed pressure on Crandall to dismiss Harris from the school, but she refused. Although the white students in the school did not openly oppose the presence of Sarah Harris, families of the current white students removed their daughters from the school. Consequently, Crandall devoted herself to teaching African-American girls, after traveling to Boston to consult with abolitionists Samuel J. May and William Lloyd Garrison about the project. (Both were supportive, and gave her letters of introduction to prominent African Americans in locations from Providence, Rhode Island to New York. She temporarily closed the school and began directly recruiting new students of color. On March 2, 1833, Garrison published advertisements for new pupils in his newspaper The Liberator. Crandall announced that on the first Monday of April 1833, she would open a school \\"for the reception of young Ladies and little Misses of color, ... Terms, $25 per quarter, one half paid in advance.\\" Her references including leading abolitionists Arthur Tappan, May, and Garrison. As word of the school spread, African-American families began arranging enrollment of their daughters in Crandall's academy. On April 1, 1833, twenty African-American girls from Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, and the surrounding areas in Connecticut arrived at Miss Crandall's School for Young Ladies and Little Misses of Color.  Public backlash  Leading the reaction to Crandall's school for black girls was her neighbor, Andrew Judson, an attorney and Canterbury's leading politician, having represented it in both the Connecticut House and Senate, and would soon be Connecticut's at-large member of the U.S. House of Representatives. In the national debate that was awkwardly taking place over \\"what to do\\" with the freed or soon-to-be-freed slaves, Judson supported \\"colonization\\": sending them to (not \\"back to\\") Africa (see American Colonization Society). He said: \\"We are not merely opposed to the establishment of that school in Canterbury; we mean there shall not be such a school set up anywhere in our State. The colored people can never rise from their menial condition in our country; they ought not to be permitted to rise here. They are an inferior race of beings, and never call or ought to be recognized as the equals of the whites.\\" \\"He predicted the destruction of the town if Crandall's school for colored children succeeded.\\" Judson was also involved in efforts to capture David Garrison and turn him over to Southerners; there was a $10,000 reward. In response to the new school, a committee of four prominent white men in the town, Rufus Adams, Daniel Frost Jr., Andrew Harris, and Richard Fenner, attempted to convince Crandall that her school for young women of color would be detrimental to the safety of the white people in the town of Canterbury. Frost claimed that the boarding school would encourage \\"social equality and intermarriage of whites and blacks.\\" To this, her response was \\"Moses had a black wife.\\" At first, citizens of Canterbury protested the school and then held town meetings \\"to devise and adopt such measures as would effectually avert the nuisance, or speedily abate it.\\" The town response escalated into warnings, threats, and acts of violence against the school. Crandall was faced with great local opposition, and her detractors had no plans to back down. On May 24, 1833, the Connecticut legislature passed a \\"Black Law\\", which prohibited a school from teaching African-American students from outside the state without town permission.\\" Alexander, Elizabeth and Nelson, Marilyn. Miss Crandall's School for Young Ladies and Little Misses of Color\\", Wordsong, 2007. In July, Crandall was arrested and placed in the county jail for one night‚Äîshe refused to be bonded out, as she wished the public to know she was being jailed. (A Vermont newspaper reported it under the headline \\"Shame on Connecticut\\".) The next day she was released under bond to await her trial. Under the Black Law, the townspeople refused any amenities to the students or Crandall, closing their shops and meeting houses to them, although they were welcomed at Prudence's Baptist church, in neighboring Plainfield.. Stage drivers refused to provide them with transportation, and the town doctors refused to treat them. Townspeople poisoned the school's well‚Äîits only water source‚Äîwith animal feces, and prevented Crandall from obtaining water from other sources. Not only did Crandall and her students receive backlash, but her father was also insulted and threatened by the citizens of Canterbury. Although she faced extreme difficulties, Crandall continued to teach the young women of color which angered the community even further. Crandall's students also suffered. Ann Eliza Hammond, a 17-year-old student, was arrested; however, with the help of local abolitionist Samuel J. May, she was able to post a bail bond. Some $10,000 was raised through collections and donations.  Judicial proceedings  Arthur Tappan of New York, a prominent abolitionist, donated $10,000 to hire the best lawyers to defend Crandall throughout her trials. The first opened at the Windham County Court on August 23, 1833. The case challenged the constitutionality of the Connecticut law prohibiting the education of African Americans from outside the state. The defense argued that African Americans were citizens in other states, so, therefore, there was no reason why they should not be considered as such in Connecticut. Thus, they focused on the deprivation of the rights of African-American students under the United States Constitution. By contrast, the prosecution denied the fact that freed African- Americans were citizens in any state. The county court jury ultimately failed to reach a decision for the cases.\\"A Statement of Facts. Respecting the School for Colored Females in Canterbury, CT Together with a Report of the Late Trial of Miss Prudence Crandall \\", Brooklyn, Connecticut: Advertiser Press, 1833. Retrieved May 11, 2010. A second trial in Superior Court decided against the school, and the case was taken to the Supreme Court of Errors (now called the Connecticut Supreme Court) on appeal in July 1834. The Connecticut high court reversed the decision of the lower court, dismissing the case on July 22 because of a procedural defect. The Black Law prohibited the education of black children from outside of Connecticut unless permission was granted by the local civil authority and town selectmen. But the prosecution's information that charged Crandall had not alleged that she had established her school without the permission of the civil authority and selectmen of Canterbury. Therefore, the Supreme Court held that the information was fatally defective because the conduct which it alleged did not constitute a crime. The Court did not address the issue of whether the citizenship of free African Americans had to be recognized in every state.Crandall v. State of Connecticut, 10 Conn. 339, 366‚Äì72 (1834). From Google Books. Retrieved on December 25, 2015. The judicial process had not stopped the operation of the Canterbury boarding school, but the townspeople's vandalism against it increased. The residents of Canterbury were so angry that the court had dismissed the case that vandals set the school on fire in January 1834, but they failed in their attempts to destroy the school.Larned, Ellen D. \\"History of Windham County, Connecticut\\", Worcester C.

Connecticut officially repealed the Black Law in 1838.\\"Connecticut's Black Law\\", Historic Texts and Transcripts. Yale University. Retrieved May 11, 2010.  Later years  At the suggestion of William Garrison, who raised the money from \\"various antislavery societies\\", Francis Alexander painted a portrait of Crandall in April 1834. She had to go to Boston for the sittings, where she \\"became the center of attention at abolitionist parties and gatherings each evening. The Boston abolitionists honored her as a true heroine of the antislavery cause.\\" In August 1834, Crandall married the Rev. Calvin Philleo, a Baptist minister in Canterbury, Connecticut. The couple moved to Massachusetts for a period of time after they fled the town of Canterbury, and they also lived in New York, Rhode Island, and Illinois. Crandall was involved in the women's suffrage movement and ran a school in LaSalle County, Illinois. She separated from Philleo in 1842 after his \\"deteriorating physical and mental health\\" led him to be abusive. He died in Illinois in 1874. After the death of her husband, Crandall relocated with her brother Hezekiah to Elk Falls, Kansas, around 1877, and it was there that her brother eventually died in 1881. A visitor of 1886, who described her as \\"of almost national renown,\\" with \\"a host of good books in her house\\", quoted her as follows: In 1886, the state of Connecticut honored Prudence Crandall with an act by the legislature, prominently supported by the writer Mark Twain, providing her with a $400 annual pension (). Prudence Crandall died in Kansas on January 28, 1890, at the age of 86. She and her brother Hezekiah are buried in Elk Falls Cemetery. Prudence Crandall's brother Reuben Prudence's younger brother Reuben was a physician and a botany expert. He was no abolitionist and was opposed to Prudence's efforts to educate African- American girls, and told this to her chief enemy Judson, when the latter gave him a ride. Reuben, who had studied medicine at Yale and practiced for 7 years in Peekskill, New York, was arrested on August 10, 1835, in Washington, D.C., and charged with sedition and publication of abolitionist literature. He narrowly escaped being lynched. At first denied bail, it was later set so high that he could not meet it, and he was jailed for 8 months before his trial. It was the first trial for sedition in the history of the country, and being in Washington it attracted a large audience, including members of Congress and reporters. Francis Scott Key was the District of Columbia prosecuting attorney. The jury acquitted Reuben of all charges; this was a major public embarrassment for Key and ended his political career. However, Crandall had contracted tuberculosis in the jail, and died shortly afterwards.Leepson, Marc, What so Proudly We Hailed: Francis Scott Key, a Life, (Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), pp. 169‚Äì172, 181‚Äì185 Prudence's sister Almira died in 1837.

Occurs eastwards over the Caucasus and Iran into Mongolia, north-east China, Korea, Afghanistan and northern Pakistan. \\"Vespertilio murinus\\", Science for Nature Foundation  Description  Their twittering call, similar to a bird's call, could be heard particularly in the autumn during the mating season. The parti-coloured bat has a body size of with a wingspan of , and a weight of . Its name is derived from its fur, which has two colours. Its back (dorsal side) is red to dark- brown, with silver-white-frosted hair. The ventral side is white or grey. The ears, wings and face are black or dark brown. The wings are narrow. The ears are short, broad and roundish. It is known to live up to 12 years.  Behaviour  These bats hunt for their prey, for example mosquitoes, caddis flies and moths, with a wide range of ultrasonic sounds, but especially around 25‚Äì27 kHz. They hunt after twilight at heights of around , for example in open landscape over streams and lakes and above forests or at street lights. In cold weather, the bat may remain in its resting place. There is not much known about the behaviour of parti-coloured bats, as they are quite rare. Female bats live in small groups, of about 50 animals, sometimes up to several hundred adult females. In Western Europe, male groups consist of about 250 animals and are found only during the spring and early summer. These bats migrate, and flights of up to were found. The furthest migration was determined at . Between October and March, the bats hibernate. They hibernate alone, and can bear temperatures down to . = Reproduction and birth = Females form maternity roosts during May and July and generally give birth to twins. After the pups are weaned, which takes less than six weeks, females leave the maternity roost. Birth of the young is in western Europe around beginning of June. Distribution The parti-coloured bat occurs in Central and Western Europe and in Asia. Its natural habitat is mountains, steppes and forested areas, but in Western Europe, they can mainly be found in cities. The species is protected, as it is threatened by insecticides and changes in their habitat.

These pastiches of 50s comics have been collected in the album Captivant. He then created the characters of Bob Fish, Adolphus Claar, Freddy Lombard, and Le Jeune Albert, a scamp character living in the Marolles, a working-class area of Brussels. Yves Chaland, was approached to draw an adventure of Spirou et Fantasio, appearinging in half-page installments of the weekly Spirou magazine. Done in a retro 50s style similar to his influences Jij√© and Andr√© Franquin, both former artists on the Spirou feature. The unfinished story has been collected in the album Spirou et Fantasio ‚Äì Hors S√©rie, No. 4 (Dupuis, 2003). He also did many advertising illustration commissions in his crisp, clean, \\"retro-modern\\" cartoon style. Books published in English As with many Franco-Belgian comics, Chaland's works have had limited publication in English. The complete Freddy Lombard series was released in the two volume Chaland Anthology. These were the only two released in English (in both paper and hardback, in 2003), while 4 volumes were released in French, containing his complete comic strip works for M√©tal Hurlant. (Chaland ‚Äì L'Int√©grale).

Black and gold is the most common colour of Hovawart. The three permitted colours. = Appearance = The Hovawart is a medium-large dog. Male Hovawarts are and females at the withers. The weight is approximately . The correct color descriptions are black, black and gold, and blond. Hovawart at work. = Temperament = The Hovawart is an outstanding watch dog and somewhat reserved towards strangers. They make excellent family dogs as they are completely devoted to their family. They are a working dog-breed, and require a consistent and loving yet strict training and meaningful activity throughout their lives. Black male, blond female hovawart. Three generations of hovawarts.  History  = Fifteenth century = By 1473, Heinrich Mynsinger described the Hovawart as one of \\"The Five Noble Breeds\\" and among its uses listed that it was useful for tracking the robber and miscreant. This along with references to the Hovawart in German law show that it was a readily identifiable breed and held in similar esteem to that of hunting dogs. = Twentieth century = A black-colored Hovawart. Following the medieval period, the popularity of the Hovawart began to decline. Newer breeds such as the German Shepherd Dog slowly replaced the Hovawart as a guard and working dog until it had almost disappeared by the beginning of the twentieth century. Around 1915 a group of enthusiasts decided to try to save the breed. Predominant in this group was the zoologist Kurt Friedrich K√∂nig. They started by looking for dogs in the farms of the Black Forest region. K√∂nig then started a careful breeding program using these dogs and crossed them with Kuvaszok, Newfoundlands, German Shepherd Dogs, Leonbergers, a Bernese Mountain Dog and an African hunting dog. After much work the group was rewarded in 1922 when the first Hovawart litter was entered into the German Breeding Registry. The enthusiasts continued their work and in 1937 the German Kennel Club officially recognised the Hovawart. All this work was almost undone with the outbreak of the Second World War. Because of their abilities many Hovawarts were used in the German war effort and perished. By 1945 only a few remained. Enthusiasm for the breed remained and in 1947, Otto Schramm and some fellow enthusiasts in Coburg formed a new club, the Rassezuchtverein f√ºr Hovawart- Hunde Coburg which is still in existence today. In 1964 the German Kennel Club recognised the Hovawart as the country's seventh working breed and around this time enthusiasm for the breed started to develop in other countries.  Miscellaneous  The Hovawart does exceptionally well in search and rescue, tracking and working dog activities. The females are generally lighter in build. In training and especially obedience work the trainer must keep positive reinforcement in mind all the time, as this breed is not as eager to please as many other working dog-breeds: it always needs some kind of motivation. It is important to realize that the Hovawart works with people and not for people. They do have the ability to think and act independently. Their guarding instinct for example does not require any real training; it is inherent, as it is what they were bred for. The Hovawart may easily become reluctant if training is built only on punishments.

Founded in London in 1935, the group moved to Ireland in 1939 and stayed until after the Second World War where they gained Irish members like Thurloe Conolly, Paul Egestorff, Stephen Gilbert and Patrick Scott. Their group philosophy, which they called Subjectivist Art, was not associated with any particular style or set belief. Instead, it encouraged an exploration of psychology and of modernist ideas. They also believed in aesthetic experimentation and aesthetics as an objective in art. Although formed in London and guided by two British born artists (Hall and Rakozci) the group has been described as \\"an Irish phenomenon\\" by the Irish art expert Dr. S.B. Kennedy. The group was at the vanguard of modern artistic ideas in Ireland, were involved in the Irish Exhibition of Living Art and influenced Patrick Scott, Gerald Dillon and Louis le Brocquy.

He is remembered in Philippine-American War annals as the opposing general to Major General Henry Ware Lawton at the Battle of San Mateo on December 19, 1899, where Lawton lost his life along with 13 other Americans. His claim to fame as the general who brought down Henry Ware Lawton is considered ironic, as Lawton had been previously credited with the capture of the Apache leader Geronimo. Early Years Ger√≥nimo was born in Samp√°loc, Manila on August 27, 1855 to Graciano Geronimo, a native of Montalban, Morong Province, and Flaviana Imaya, a native of Gapan, Nueva Ecija. He was the eldest of six siblings. When he was nine, he lived with his grandfather in a farm in San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan Province. At 14, he joined his father in Montalban where he helped in farm chores. Due to poverty, Geronimo did not enjoy the benefits of formal education but he learned how to read and write with the help of a friend who taught him the alphabet. He married twice; his first marriage to Francisca Reyes ended with her death. His second wife was Cayetana Lincaoco of San Mateo, who bore him five children. He earned a living by farming, and by working as a boatman on the Marikina and Pasig rivers, transporting passengers to and from Manila. https://philippineamericanwar.webs.com/genlawtondies1899.htm Philippine Revolution Geronimo was recruited into the secret revolutionary society Katipunan by his godfather, Felix Umali, alguacil mayor of barrio Wawa, Montalban. A member of the Katipunan, Ger√≥nimo was part of the rebel group that assaulted the San Juan del Monte gunpowder magazine on August 30, 1896, and organized forces under his command in Montalban, San Mateo, and Marikina. In 1897, he took part in the Battle of Mount Puray, and was designated as Division General in charge of Rizal Province after the death of Andres Bonifacio. After the defeat of the Spanish, he was then appointed by General Antonio Luna as the commanding general of the third military zone of Manila, and it was in this capacity that he served in the Battle of San Mateo. It was in this battle that General Henry Ware Lawton, the highest ranking officer of the US expeditionary forces in the Philippines was killed in action. Private Bonifacio Mariano, a member of Tiradores de la Muerte, shot the lethal round that hit the general right through the lungs. By 1900, he was appointed as the superior chief of the second and third zones of Manila, and he also held the commands of Morong and Marinduque. On March 29, 1901 Gen. Licerio Ger√≥nimo, 6 officers, and 40 soldiers surrender at San Mateo, Manila to Col. J Milton Thompson and the 42nd Regiment of Infantry. Col Thompson informed Gen. Ger√≥nimo of Emilio Aguinaldo's capture 6 days prior. He remained skeptical until Col. Thompson produced a newspaper headlining Aguinaldo's capture. Shortly afterwards, Gen. Licerio Ger√≥nimo, along with his troops, took the Oath of Allegiance to the United States. Later Years Ger√≥nimo later worked for the United States and enlisted for the Philippine Constabulary on June 1, 1902 as an inspector, successfully bringing in bandits and former soldiers roaming the countryside. He was also part of the search party that brought down General Luciano San Miguel and his followers on March 27, 1903. He left the constabulary on May 16, 1904 and returned to work his farm in Barrio San Rafael, Montalban.https://philippineamericanwar.webs.com/genlawtondies1899.htm Ger√≥nimo died on January 16, 1924 and his remains were interred in the Mausoleo de los Veteranos de la Revoluci√≥n in Manila North Cemetery, La Loma, Manila.

Dhanabalan, is a former Singaporean politician. He was a high-profile political leader in Singapore in the 1980s and held several cabinet positions in the 1980s and early 1990s under prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong. Early life and education Dhanabalan was born in 1937 to a Singaporean Indian family of Tamil descent. He was raised as a Hindu by his father, Arumugam Suppiah, a clerk at a naval base. But later in his life he became a devout Christian (Brethren). His mother is Gunaretnam Suppiah. He went to Victoria School; and later to University of Malaya where he earned his B.A. degree in Economics, earning a Second Class Honours (Upper Division). He was the third child and the eldest son in a Tamil family of three girls and three boys. Early career He joined (Ministry of Finance) as an Administrative Officer from 1960‚Äì68. During his tenure, he helped to form the Economic Development Board and DBS Bank. He subsequently left the Civil Service and joined DBS as a Vice- President from 1968‚Äì1970. He was promoted to the position of Executive Vice- President and continue to serve from 1970‚Äì1978. Political career In the 1976 Singapore general election, Dhanabalan was elected as Member of Parliament for Kallang SMC, as a People's Action Party (PAP) candidate. He was promoted to a Cabinet Minister and served in various portfolios, including Foreign Affairs, Culture, Community Development, National Development and Trade and Industry. When Lee Kuan Yew was preparing for his successor, he identified a handful of ministers he considered suitable for the job, including Tony Tan, Ong Teng Cheong, Goh Chok Tong and Dhanabalan. In his public account of why he chose them and what he felt were their strengths and weaknesses, Lee said his preferred successor was Tony Tan, who went on to become the 7th President of the Republic of Singapore. He felt that while the other three were all of prime ministerial calibre, each had a particular weakness: Goh was too stiff, lacking eloquence in public speaking, and Ong was too closely aligned with the Chinese-speaking masses, lacking appeal to other communities. In the case of Dhanabalan, Lee felt the 76% ethnic Chinese electorate was not yet ready for a prime minister of Indian ethnicity. Lee left the ultimate decision to the second generation ministers themselves, who went on to choose Goh.

Background Between 1 and 3 August 1798 a British fleet, under Admiral Horatio Nelson, defeated a French fleet, under Fran√ßois-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers, in Aboukir Bay, in the Battle of the Nile. The French fleet consisted of thirteen ships of the line and four frigates. Nelson had fourteen ships of the line. All but four of the French ships were destroyed or captured. No British ships were lost. After Nelson's death at the Battle of Trafalgar, it is believed that Charles Douglas, 6th Marquess of Queensberry, a friend of Nelson's mistress, Emma Hamilton, planted clumps of beech trees on his estate near Amesbury to commemorate him. Each clump represented the location of a British or French ship at a particular point in the battle. There may have been as many as twenty-six clumps originally, spread out over three quarters of a mile, of which some seventeen remain. Today Seventeen clumps remain today and are now under preservation orders. However, as beech has a natural life of some 200 years many are dying off. Many clumps are being replanted by local volunteers, each with about 200 mixed trees including beech, maple and hawthorn. Amongst the clumps that have been replanted are those for Swiftsure, Defence, L'Orient and Bellerophon. Robert Dodd from which the clumps layout is said to be taken. The evidence that the clumps were planted to commemorate the battle is based on local lore and a similarity between the layout of the woods and the position of ships shown in Robert Dodd's map of the battle. The UK National Maritime Museum has also suggested that the link between the Battle of the Nile and the clumps is \\"quite likely\\". Most of the surviving clumps stand on the north side of the A303 to the west of Amesbury and inside the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, although several used to stand south and along the course of the road. Several of the remaining clumps stand on land owned by the National Trust's Stonehenge Landscape property. Other woods A plaque on the Nelson Memorial at Swarland mentions a line of trees in the shape of the coastline of the Nile delta, with other trees in the positions of the British and French ships, to the west of the monument. Aerial photographs suggest that the trees may be at . The Nile Clumps are sometimes incorrectly referred to as the Trafalgar Clumps. There is a separate Trafalgar Woods project to plant a total of 250,000 trees in a series of woods across the UK to commemorate the 2005 bicentenary of the Battle of Trafalgar. There will be a total of 33 clumps, each representing a ship which took part in the battle. The largest will be Victory Wood in Kent with 100,000 trees.

The two species are the African river martin Pseudochelidon eurystomina, found in the Congo and Gabon, and the white-eyed river martin Pseudochelidon sirintarae, known only from one site in Thailand. These are medium-sized, largely black swallows that have a light buoyant flight and feed on insects caught in the air. They appear to be more terrestrial than other swallows, frequently walking rather than perching, and the white-eyed may be crepuscular. The African species excavates nest holes in sandy ridges in rivers, while the breeding locations and habits of the Asian bird are unknown. When the African river martin was first discovered in the 19th century, Gustav Hartlaub thought it was a roller, and later authors either placed it in its own family, or with the woodswallows. Study of the anatomy revealed that the species was closest to the swallows and martins, but that it possessed a number of distinctive features, such as its robust legs and feet and stout bill. These indicated that it should be placed in a separate subfamily. The two river martin species are usually considered to belong to a single genus, Pseudochelidon, due to their having a number of structural similarities. However, Brooke proposed that the white-eyed river martin be placed in a separate monotypic genus Eurochelidon. The African river martin has a restricted distribution; it appears to be locally numerous, although its true status has not been fully investigated. The white-eyed river martin was discovered as recently as 1969 and is only known from specimens and anecdotal evidence ‚Äì no modern ornithologists have seen the species in the wild, and its breeding grounds are unknown. It may be extinct, although a possible sighting was reported in 2004. Taxonomy When a specimen of the African river martin from Gabon was first formally described by German zoologist Gustav Hartlaub in 1861, it was not initially identified as a member of the swallow and martin family. Hartlaub placed it with the rollers, and later authors either put it in its own separate family, or with the woodswallows. It was only following study of the anatomy of the species by Lowe that it was determined to be closely related to the swallows and martins, but sufficiently different that it could be placed in a separate subfamily Pseudochelidoninae. The genus name Pseudochelidon comes from the Ancient Greek prefix œàŒµœÖŒ¥Œø/pseudo, \\"false\\", and œáŒµŒªŒπŒ¥œâŒΩ/chelid√¥n, \\"swallow\\", reflecting its distinctiveness from the \\"true\\" swallows. For many years the African river martin was the sole member of its genus and subfamily until the discovery of the white-eyed river martin, Pseudochelidon eurystomina, by Thai ornithologist Kitti Thonglongya in 1968. Although some authorities follow Brooke in placing that species in a separate genus Eurochelidon due to its significant differences from the African species, it remains a member of the same subfamily. Genetic studies confirmed that the two river martins form a distinct clade from the typical swallows in the Hirundininae subfamily. The river martins are in some ways intermediate between typical swallows and other passerines: they have stout bills, large feet and relatively strong legs, which is unusual in aerial feeders. They also have a large syrinx (vocal organ) and a different bronchial structure. The extent of their differences from other swallows and the wide geographical separation of these two martins suggest that they are relict populations of a group of species that diverged from the main swallow lineage early in its evolutionary history, and they may be the most primitive of the swallows. Like other early hirundine lineages, they nest in burrows, rather than adopted nest holes or mud nests. Description Both species are medium-sized (), mainly black-plumaged swallows, unlikely to be confused with any other hirundine in their respective ranges. Adults of both species have large, blue-glossed heads, a green tinge to the body plumage, and brown wings. The sexes are similar in plumage. The white-eyed has elongated outer tail feathers, a whitish rump, a white eye and eye-ring, and a yellow bill. The African has a red eye-ring and bill and lacks a contrasting rump patch or tail streamers. The juveniles of both species are similar to the adults, but with brown heads, and young white-eyeds lack the long tail streamers of the adults. The African river martin has a chee chee or cheer-cheer-cheer call when it is flying in flocks. It is very vocal during migration, giving harsh gull-like calls, and appears to have a jingling courtship song. No calls have been described for the white-eyed river martin. Distribution and habitat The two members of the subfamily have geographically separate ranges. The African river martin breeds along the Congo and Ubangi rivers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is migratory, wintering in coastal savannah in southern Gabon and the Republic of Congo; it has recently been discovered to nest in beach ridges and grassland in its coastal wintering areas. The white-eyed river martin is known only from its wintering site at Bueng Boraphet lake in Thailand, where it was seen between the months of November and February. It may be migratory, but its breeding grounds and habitat are unknown, although river valleys in Northern Thailand or south-western China are possibilities, as are Cambodia and Myanmar. However, doubts have been cast on whether it is actually migratory at all. The African species' breeding habitat consists of forested rivers with islands with sandy shores for breeding. The nesting grounds of the white-eyed river martin are unknown, but if the breeding habitat resembles that of its relative, it is likely to be the forested valleys of large rivers, which can provide sandbars and islands for nesting, and woodland over which the birds can catch insect prey. The African river martin uses coastal savannah as its winter habitat. Based on its only known wintering site, the non-breeding habitat of the white-eyed is assumed to be in the vicinity of open fresh water for feeding, with reed-beds for the night-time roost. Behaviour The Congo River is a major breeding area of the African river martin Breeding behaviour is known only for the African river martin. It nests in large colonies of up to 800 birds from December to April, when the river levels are low. Each pair excavates a long tunnel in the exposed sandbanks. The pocket at the end of the tunnel has a few twigs and leaves to serve as a nest, onto which two to four unspotted white eggs are laid. It has chasing flight displays and will walk on the ground; it also displays on the ground, but the function of this is uncertain. It rarely perches during the breeding season. Although it has been assumed that the breeding habits of the white-eyed species resemble those of the African species, distinctive differences in foot and toe morphology suggest that it might not use a burrow for nesting. The African river martin feeds in flocks over river and forest, often far from water. It eats insects, mainly taking winged ants. The flight is strong and fast, interspersed with glides. Wintering birds regularly perch on treetops, wires and roofs. The white-eyed river martin feeds on insects, including beetles, which are caught on the wing. Given its size and unusual mouth structure, it may take larger insects than other swallows. This species is described as graceful and buoyant in flight, and, like its African relative, appears reluctant to use perches. This behaviour, together with its unusual toe-shape and the fact that mud was found on the toes of one of the first specimens, suggests that this species may be relatively terrestrial. In winter, it roosts with barn swallows in reedbeds. p233 Pamela C. Rasmussen suggested that, given its unusually large eyes, the species might be nocturnal or crepuscular, a factor that could make it highly cryptic and thus partly explain how such a distinctive species remained undetected for so long. Although the fact that the first specimens were supposedly collected roosting at night in reed-beds might be a contraindication, it is possible that the birds might not actually have been caught at the roost; or they might be crepuscular, feeding at dawn and dusk; or they might be capable of both diurnal and nocturnal behaviour, depending on the season or local circumstances. Status Gustav Hartlaub described the African river martin The white-eyed river martin was seen in Thailand in 1972, 1977 and 1980, but not definitely since. There are unconfirmed sightings from Thailand in 1986 and Cambodia in 2004. It is classified as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). This designation means that a species' numbers have decreased, or will decrease, by 80% within three generations. This species may be extinct, but the IUCN will not categorise it as such until extensive targeted surveys have been conducted. Despite legal protection under Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) agreement, it was captured by locals along with other swallows for sale as food or for release by devout Buddhists. Following its discovery by ornithologists, trappers were reported to have caught as many as 120 and sold them to the director of the Nakhon Sawan Fisheries Station who was unable to keep them alive in captivity. The small population may therefore have become non-viable. One factor that reduces the chances of re-discovering the white-eyed martin is the drastic decline in the numbers of swallows wintering at Bueng Boraphet, its only known site, from the hundreds of thousands reported around 1970 to maximum counts of 8,000 made in the winter of 1980‚Äì1981. It is not certain whether this represents a real decline or a shift in site in response to persecution. Other potential causes for the species' decline include the disturbance of riverine sand bars, the construction of dams which flood the area upstream and alter the downstream hydrology, deforestation, and increasing conversion of its habitat to agriculture. Very few swallows now roost in the Bueng Boraphet reedbeds, preferring sugarcane plantations, and, despite searching, the white-eyed river martin has not been found in other nearby large swallow roosts. Bueng Boraphet has been declared a non-hunting area in an effort to protect the species, but surveys to find this martin have been unsuccessful. Past surveys include several at Bueng Boraphet, a 1969 survey of the Nan Yom and Wang Rivers of northern Thailand, and a 1996 survey of rivers in northern Laos. A possible unverified sighting was reported in 2004. The total population size of the African river martin is unknown. In the late 1980s, it appeared to be common, if local, and large numbers were seen on migration in Gabon. However, it is particularly poorly known in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and it is unclear if there is any relationship between the birds breeding in the DRC and those breeding in coastal areas of Gabon and the Republic of Congo. A flock of 15,000 birds was seen in 1997, and a mixed flock with rosy bee-eater Merops malimbicus was estimated at 100,000 birds; nevertheless, due to the lack of detailed information, the species is classed by the IUCN as Data Deficient. In the 1950s, the species was caught and eaten in large quantities in the DRC by the local population, and this practice could be increasing. Breeding colonies in river sandbars are also liable to flooding, but thousands of birds were breeding on the grasslands east of Gamba as recently as 2005.

Thatcher coined the usage in 1979‚Äì80, with the meaning of feeble, lacking hardness, or willing to compromise with the unions. The label was especially applied to senior members of her government who were nevertheless outside Thatcher's inner circle and who expressed opposition to her strict monetarist policies designed to tackle inflation, and her cuts to public spending. Hugo Young identifies the most important \\"inner\\" wets as Jim Prior, Peter Walker, and Sir Ian Gilmour, as well as Lord Carrington and Norman St John-Stevas. The \\"outer\\" wets were more fragmented and less visible. They included Francis Pym, Michael Heseltine and Lord Hailsham. Gilmour was the most outspoken, delivering a lecture at Cambridge in February 1980 where he argued: \\"In the Conservative view, economic liberalism √† la Professor Hayek, because of its starkness and its failure to create a sense of community, is not a safeguard of political freedom but a threat to it.\\" In the 1980s Nick's Diner was started. Named in honour of Nicholas Scott, at the time a rising star of the anti-Thatcher wing of the Party, it served as a convivial meeting ground for wet MPs . In retaliation to being labelled as \\"wet\\", Thatcher's opponents within the party began referring to her supporters as the \\"dries\\". Policies which came to be labelled as \\"dry\\" included foremostly reducing public spending, cutting taxes, raising interest rates, tightly controlling the money supply, and reducing the regulatory power of the state ‚Äì all policies which were closely associated with Thatcher. Outside of the Parliamentary Conservative Party, the youth sections of the Party saw increasingly bitter factional battles between \\"wets\\" and \\"dries\\". The Young Conservatives wing of the party remained in the hands of a strong \\"wet\\" and One Nation (Tory Reform Group) faction until 1989, whilst the Federation of Conservative Students remained in the hands of an alliance of libertarian and Monday Club supporters. Origin of the term Historically, English public school sports were divided between \\"wets\\" - who rowed - and \\"dries\\" - who played cricket or rugby. Slang came to describe as \\"wet\\" someone judged to be too weak, feeble or \\"soppy\\" to play field sports. Within the political context, the term was used by Thatcher's supporters as both as a noun and as an adjective to characterise people or policies which Thatcher would have considered weak or \\"wet\\".

It is located in the Valle Peligna, a plateau once occupied by a lake that disappeared in prehistoric times. In the ancient era, it was one of the most important cities of the Paeligni and is known for being the native town of the Roman poet Ovid, of whom there is a bronze statue, located on the town's main road and named after him. History =Ancient era= The Roman poet Ovid, born in the city. Basilica della Santissima Annunziata. Sulmona was one of the principal cities of the Paeligni, an Italic tribe, but no notice of it is found in history before the Roman conquest. A tradition alluded to by Ovid and Silius Italicus, which ascribed its foundation to Solymus, a Phrygian and one of the companions of Aeneas, is evidently a mere etymological fiction.Ovid, Fasti iv. 79; Silius Italicus ix. 70-76.) The first mention of Sulmo occurs in the Second Punic War, when its territory was ravaged by Hannibal in 211 BC, who, however, did not attack the city itself.Livy xxvi. 11. Its name is not noticed during the Social War, in which the Paeligni took so prominent a part; but according to Florus, it suffered severely in the subsequent civil war between Sulla and Gaius Marius, having been destroyed by the former as a punishment for allegiance to his rival.Flor. iii. 21. The writings of that rhetorical writer are not, however, to be taken literally, and it is more probable that Sulmo was confiscated and its lands assigned by Sulla to a body of his soldiers.August Wilhelm Zumpt, De Coloniis' p. 261. In all events it is certain that Sulmo was a well-peopled and considerable town in 49 BC, when it was occupied by Domitius Calvinus with a garrison of seven cohorts; but the citizens, who were favorably inclined towards Julius Caesar, opened their gates to his lieutenant M. Antonius as soon as he presented himself.Julius Caesar Commentarii de Bello Civili i. 18; Cicero ad Att. viii. 4, 12 a.) Not much more is known historically of Sulmo, which, however, appears to have continued to be a considerable provincial town. Ovid speaks of it as one of the three municipal towns whose districts composed the territory of the Paeligni:\\"Peligni pars tertia ruris\\", Amor. ii. 16. 1. and this is confirmed both by Pliny and the Liber Coloniarum; yet it does not seem to have ever been large, and Ovid himself designates it as a small provincial town.Amor. iii. 15. From the Liber Coloniarum we learn also that it had received the status of a colony, probably in the time of Augustus;Plin. iii. 12. s. 17; Lib. Colon. pp. 229, 260. though Pliny does not give it the title of a Colonia. Inscriptions, as well as the geographers and Itineraries, attest its continued existence as a municipal town throughout the Roman Empire.(Strabo v. p. 241; Ptolemy iii. 1. ¬ß 64; Tabula Peutingeriana; Orell. Inscr. 3856; Mommsen, Inscr. R. N. pp. 287‚Äì289. The chief claim to fame of Sulmona is derived from its having been the birthplace of Ovid, who repeatedly alludes to it as such, and celebrates its salubrity, and the numerous permanent streams of clear water in which its neighbourhood abounded. But, like the whole district of the Paeligni, it was extremely cold in winter, whence Ovid himself, and Silius Italicus in imitation of him, calls it \\"gelidus Sulmo\\"Ovid, Fasti iv. 81, Trist. iv. 10. 3, Amor. ii. 16; Sil. Ital. viii. 511. Its territory was fertile, cultivation of both in grain and wine are common, and one district, the Pagus Fabianus, is particularly mentioned by Plinyxvii. 26. s. 43. for the care bestowed on the irrigation of the vineyards. =Middle Ages and Renaissance= Church of Santa Maria della Tomba. Traditionally, the beginning of the Christian age in Sulmona is set in the 3rd century. The city was part of the diocese of Valva, while a Sulmonese bishop is known from the 5th century. One of the earliest bishops was Saint Pamphilus (San Panfilo), an Italian pagan convert to Christianity in the 7th century from nearby Corfinium. He was elected bishop of Valva in 682 and died in 706. He is the patron saint of Sulmona and is buried in the church dedicated to him, the present Sulmona Cathedral. Sulmona became a free commune under the Normans. Under Emperor Frederick II an aqueduct was built in the town, one of the most important constructions of the era in the Abruzzo; the emperor made it the capital of a large province, as well the seat of a tribunal and of a fair, which it however lost with the arrival of the Angevins. Despite that, it continued to expand and a new line of walls was added in the 14th century. In the 16th century a flourishing paper industry was started. =Modern age= Church of Badia Morronese. In 1706 the city was nearly razed by an earthquake. While much of the medieval city was destroyed by the earthquake, some remarkable buildings survive such as the Church of Santa Maria della Tomba, the Palazzo Annunziata, the Aqueduct and the Gothic portal on Corso Ovidio. Much of the city was then rebuilt in the prevailing elegant Baroque style of the 18th century. Sulmona experienced an economic boom in the late 19th century, becoming a railway hub given its strategic geographic position between Rome and the Adriatic coast. The anarchist and labor organiser Carlo Tresca was born there in 1879 and was active in the Italian Railroad Workers' Federation until emigrating to the US in 1904 to escape a prison term. Sulmona's strategic position also made it a target for air raids during World War II. The railway station, the industrial sections and parts of the old town were damaged, but today they have been mostly restored. Campo 78 Campo 78 at Sulmona served as a POW camp in both world wars. During World War I, it housed Austrian prisoners captured in the Isonzo and Trentino campaigns; during World War II, it was home to as many as 3,000 British and Commonwealth officers and other ranks captured in North Africa. The camp itself was built on a hillside and consisted of a number of brick barracks surrounded by a high wall. During World War II, conditions in Sulmona for both the officers and the men were indifferent. Accommodation was overcrowded. Normal rations of rice soup and bread were occasionally augmented by fresh fruit and cheese in the summer. Some food parcels from the International Committee of the Red Cross were distributed occasionally. For recreation, the prisoners laid out a football field, and they also had equipment for cricket and basketball. There was a theatre, a small lending library, at least one band, and a newspaper produced by a group of prisoners. In September 1943, as the Italian government neared collapse, the inmates of Sulmona heard rumours that the evacuation of the camp was imminent. They awoke one morning to discover that their guards had deserted them. On 14 September, German troops arrived to escort the prisoners northwards, to captivity in Germany, but not before hundreds of them had escaped into the hills. One such escapee was the South African author, Uys Krige, who described his experience in a book titled The way out. There were two other smaller camps nearby, Fontana d'Amore, which held British officers, and Villa Orsini, which held very senior Allied officers captured during World War II, including Air Marshal Owen Tudor Boyd, Major-General Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart, Brigadier James Hargest, Lieutenant General Sir Philip Neame, General Sir Richard Nugent O'Connor. All were subsequently transferred to Castello di Vincigliata Campo PG12 near Florence.Hargest, Neame, Carton de Wiart, Leeming, Main sights Sights in Sulmona include: Sulmona Cathedral. * Sulmona Cathedral, located on the northwest side of the old city and was built on the site of a Roman temple. It contains a crypt which retains its Romanesque appearance despite the 18th-century renovation of the main church. * Piazza XX Settembre. One of the main piazzas in the city, including a bronze statue of the Roman poet Ovid. * Corso Ovidio. The city's main thoroughfare connects the cathedral and the major piazzas and is lined by elegant covered arcades, shops, cafes, palaces and churches. * Palazzo Annunziata and Chiesa della SS. Annunziata. The Palace, one of the rare examples of late medieval/early Renaissance architecture in Sulmona that survived the earthquake of 1706. Its facade contains fine sculpture and tracery work. Inside the Palazzo is a museum showcasing the Roman history of the city as well as various artefacts. The church is a fine example of Baroque architecture and has a beautiful interior and bell tower. * Piazza Garibaldi is the largest piazza in town with a large baroque era fountain. A Palio style medieval festival and horse race known as the Giostra Cavalleresca takes place here every year in the Summer. At Easter, crowds gather to witness the Madonna che Scappa. This ceremony involves the procession of a statue of the Madonna which is carried across the piazza while the bearers run to encounter a statue of the resurrected Christ on the other side. On the south side of the piazza is the 12th century Gothic aqueduct. The town square hosts a market twice a week on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The remains of the ancient city are of little interest as ruins, but indicate the existence of a considerable town; among them are the vestiges of an amphitheatre, a theatre, and thermae, all of them located outside the gates of the modern city. About 3km from the city, at the foot of Monte Morrone, are some ruins of reticulated masonry, traditionally believed to be Ovid's villa. Today, they are more properly identified as the sanctuary of Hercules Curinus. Nearby is the Badia Morronese, a large (c. 119 √ó 140 m) religious complex located near Pope Celestine V's hermitage. It was founded by Celestine as a chapel in 1241, and was enlarged and later made into a convent. Confetti Flowers made from Confetti candy. Sulmona is the home of the Italian confectionery known as confetti. These are sugar-coated almonds and are traditionally given to friends and relatives on weddings and other special occasions. Confetti can be eaten or simply used as decoration. The local artisans also colour these candies and craft them into flowers and other creations. There are two main factories in town and several shops that sell these items, the most famous of which is Confetti Mario Pelino.

Records in 1963. The album consists of a single continuous composition‚Äîpartially written as a ballet‚Äîdivided into four tracks and six movements. Album information The album was recorded on January 20, 1963 by an eleven-piece band. Mingus has called the album's orchestral style \\"ethnic folk-dance music\\". Mingus's perfectionism led to extensive use of studio overdubbing techniques. The album features liner notes written by Mingus and his then-psychotherapist, Edmund Pollock. The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady is often characterized by jazz and music critics as one of Mingus's two major masterworks (the other being Mingus Ah Um) and has frequently ranked highly on lists of the best albums of all time. Bob Hammer was co-orchestrator and arranger for the album. In the book The Penguin Jazz Guide: The History of the Music in the 1000 Best Albums, Sue Mingus says: \\"In some fashion, Charles absorbed Bob Hammer's rehearsal band for a six-weeks gig he had at the Village Vanguard in 1963, which provided a unique opportunity to work out, night after night, one of his greatest compositions, The Black Saint and The Sinner Lady.\\" In the book Mingus Speaks, arranger Sy Johnson recollects: \\"Bob Hammer was very successful at that. He's a piano player, who was around here, in 1962 or something like that, when he did Mingus's masterpiece, as far as I concerned, a brilliant piece of orchestration and brilliant performance of The Black Saint and The Sinner Lady\\". Reception The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady is among the most acclaimed jazz records of the 20th century. Richard Cook and Brian Morton, writers of The Penguin Guide to Jazz, awarded the album a \\"Crown\\" token, the publication's highest accolade, in addition to the highest four- star rating. Steve Huey of AllMusic awards The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady five stars out of five and describes the album as \\"one of the greatest achievements in orchestration by any composer in jazz history.\\" Q magazine describes the album as \\"a mixture of haunting bluesiness, dancing vivacity, and moments of Andalusian heat...\\" and awards it four of five stars.

It is directed by Curtis Hanson with an adapted screenplay by Susannah Grant and stars Cameron Diaz, Toni Collette, and Shirley MacLaine. The film focuses on the relationship between two sisters and their grandmother. Plot Maggie (Cameron Diaz) and Rose Feller (Toni Collette) are very different sisters, raised by their father Michael (Ken Howard) and stepmother Sydelle (Candice Azzara) after their mother Caroline died in a car accident. Rose is the elder; an ostensibly plain and serious lawyer who is protective of Maggie despite her flaws. Maggie is a free spirit who is unable to hold a steady job (due to her virtual inability to read) and turns to alcohol and men for emotional and financial support. Rose grudgingly allows Maggie to move in with her in her Rittenhouse Square apartment in Philadelphia when their stepmother throws her out of the house. Their already difficult relationship turns worse when Rose catches Maggie in bed with Jim (Richard Burgi), a man Rose has been dating. A heartbroken and furious Rose throws Maggie out. A few days before, while secretly looking through her father's desk for money, Maggie had discovered a bundle of old greeting cards for her and Rose, containing cash, from their \\"estranged\\" grandmother Ella (Shirley MacLaine). Homeless and without job prospects, Maggie travels to Florida to find Ella. Ella invites Maggie to stay in her home. Ella admits to her close friend Ethel how Caroline was bipolar, and sent Ella a note several days before her death to look after her girls. However, as time passes, Ella discovers that Maggie has visited to do nothing but sunbathe and take money from her. Maggie asks Ella to finance an acting career, but Ella agrees to match her salary dollar for dollar if she accepts a job with the assisted living section of her grandmother's retirement community. Meanwhile, Rose has decided to quit her job, become a dog-walker, and date Simon Stein (Mark Feuerstein), a coworker whom she had previously ignored. They become engaged. Maggie is befriended by one of her patients, a blind retired professor of English literature (Norman Lloyd), who has asked Maggie to read works of poetry to him. She does so, but with great difficulty. After asking if she is dyslexic, the professor encourages Maggie to continue reading to him while offering guidance and emotional support. Maggie becomes friendly with other residents of the retirement community, and discovers that some of the women need a personal clothing shopper, an activity for which Maggie shows enormous talent. Ella offers to run the financial aspects of the business, and in the process she and Maggie become close and resolve their history. Meanwhile, Rose's reluctance to talk about Maggie is straining her relationships with Simon and her father. While Michael remains oblivious to his daughters' falling out, Simon tries to get Rose to talk about Maggie. When he sees Rose talking to Jim about Maggie, Simon's patience has grown thin and effectively dumps Rose after she continues staying silent about Maggie. Ella contacts Rose and sends a plane ticket, asking her to come for a visit. Rose is excited to hear from her long-lost grandmother, but her pleasure quickly sours when she arrives and discovers that Maggie already lives there. Rose reveals to Ella and Maggie that after Caroline took young Rose and Maggie on a spontaneous trip to New York without Michael's knowledge, Michael and Caroline had a huge argument, with Michael threatening to put her in a mental institution. Caroline killed herself two days later after sending a note to Ella, pleading with her to take care of her daughters. Maggie does not remember this as Rose shielded her from the events to protect her. Simon arrives in Florida, summoned by Maggie, and he and Rose reconcile. Rose opens up to him about Maggie and her desire to protect her, fearing that Simon will come to hate Maggie. Later, Rose's wedding takes place at the Jamaican Jerk Hut in Philadelphia where she and Simon had their first date. Ella and Michael reconcile, and Maggie reads a poem to Rose as a wedding gift, which moves Rose to tears. Cast * Cameron Diaz as Maggie Feller, a party girl, immature and often petty. She was six years old at the time of her mother's death and had been told by Rose that it was a car accident. She is incapable of reading but later learns how through the help of an elderly man who was once a professor. * Toni Collette as Rose Feller, a plainly-presented workaholic, and very protective of Maggie. She is a bit older than Maggie and knew of their mother's bipolar disorder and knew that she committed suicide. * Shirley MacLaine as Ella Hirsch, Rose and Maggie's grandmother. Carries a lot of guilt for pushing her daughter to always be on her medication and never being there for Rose and Maggie. * Ken Howard as Michael Feller, Rose and Maggie's father. He also carries a lot of guilt for the fight that occurred just days before his wife killed herself, believing that he also \\"pushed\\" Ella away after Caroline died. * Brooke Smith as Amy, Rose's best friend. * Candice Azzara as Sydelle Feller, stepmother. Constantly berates Rose and Maggie while bragging about her daughter, Marcia (who has limited screen time in the movie, only appearing in the bridal shower and wedding scenes.) * Richard Burgi as Jim Danvers, Rose's office fling.

His best known work is the Chronicon Helveticum, a history of the early Swiss Confederation. Statesman and historian Having served his native land in various offices, in 1558 he became the chief magistrate or Landarnmann, and in 1559 was ennobled by the Emperor Ferdinand, to whom he had been sent as ambassador. Originally inclined to moderation, he became later in life more and more devoted to the cause of the Counter- Reformation. It is, however, as the historian of the Swiss Confederation that he is best known. He collected material for three major works, which have never wholly lost their value, though his researches have been largely corrected. In 1538 his book on Rhaetia, written in 1528, was published in Latin and in German: De prisca ac vera Alpina Rh√¶tia, or Die uralt warhafftig Alpisch Rh√¶tia. Publications and influence Tschudi's chief works were not published until long after his death. The Beschreibung Galliae Comatae appeared under Gallati's editorship in 1758, and is mainly devoted to a topographical, historical and antiquarian description of ancient Helvetia and Rhaetia, the latter part being his early work on Rhaetia revised and greatly enlarged. This book was designed practically as an introduction to his magnum opus, the Chronicon Helveticum, part of which (from 1001 to 1470) was published by J. R. Iselin in two stately folios (1734‚Äì1736); the rest consists only of rough materials. There exist two rather antiquated biographies of Tschudi by I. Fuchs (2 vols, St Gall, 1805) and C. Vogel (Z√ºrich, 1856). Tschudi worked from both documents and legends to portray the ancient traditions of Swiss defense of liberty, giving roles not only to William Tell but to the heroic moment of the foundation of the Confederacy, when Werner Stauffacher representing Schwyz, Walter F√ºrst of Uri and Arnold of Melchtal for Unterwalden meet at the Rutli, a meadow above Lake Lucerne, and take an oath to defend Swiss freedom. Tschudi‚Äôs influential text dates that event to 8 November 1307.Rowan, Steven , review of Tschudi , Aegidius, Chronicon Helveticum, Historisch-kritische Ausgabe, Speculum, Vol. 52, No. 1.

Criticism Down to the latter part of the 19th century Swiss historical writers had largely based their works on his investigations and manuscripts. The historical reputation of Tschudi has suffered after later research. His statements and documents relating to Roman times and the early history of Glarus and his own family had long roused suspicion. Detailed examination has proved that he not merely claimed to have copied Roman inscriptions that had never existed, and amended others in an arbitrary fashion, but that he deliberately forged documents to push back the origin of his family to the 10th century. He thus also entirely misrepresented the early history of Glarus, which is that of a democratic community, and not (as he pretended) that of a preserve of several aristocratic families. Tschudi's historical credit is thus low, and no document printed or historical statement made by him can be accepted without careful verification and examination. For a summary of these discoveries see Georg von Wyss in the Jahrbuch of the Historical Society of Glarus (1895), vol. xxx., in No. i (1894), of the Anzeiger f. schweizerische Geschichte, and in his Geschichte d. Historiographie in d. Schweiz (1895), pp. 196, 201, 202. The original articles by Vogelin (Roman inscriptions) appeared in vols xi., xiv. and xv. (1886‚Äì1890) of the Jahrbuch f. schweizer Geschichte, and that by Schulte (Glarus) in vol. xviii. (1893) of the same periodical. For the defence, see a weak pamphlet, Schulte u.

The two towns formed a joint urban district from 1927 until 1974, before becoming part of Wyre. The two towns constitute part of the Blackpool Urban Area. Political geography The civil parish of Thornton became an urban district in 1900, and was then renamed Thornton-Cleveleys in 1927.Thornton-Cleveleys UD Lancashire through time  Administrative history of Local Government District: hierarchies, boundaries On April 1, 1974, the urban district became part of the Borough of Wyre. Thornton-Cleveleys corresponds with five wards of the borough. According to the 2001 census Thornton- Cleveleys has a population of 25,547, increasing to 28,703 at the 2011 census. The population of the individual borough council wards was recorded as: *Bourne: 6,121 (2011 = 6,676) *Cleveleys Park: 5,994 (2011 = 5,940) *Jubilee: 4,186 (2011 = 4,025) *Stanah: 5,267 (2011 = 6,111) *Victoria: 5,851 (2011 = 5,951) History Thornton is first mentioned in 1086 in the Domesday Book, where it was referred to as Torentum (a name preserved by Torentum Court on Lawsons Road). At the time it covered a large area including what are now Cleveleys and Fleetwood, and had a very low population density. It is thought that a settlement had existed at the site since the Iron Age, and a Roman road passes close to the village. The area remained lightly populated until 1799, when the marshland around the village was drained and agricultural production began on a large scale.History - Thornton Through Time A railway station was opened in Thornton in 1865. The opening of salt works at nearby Burn Naze by the United Alkali Company in the early 1890s (later becoming ICI) led to significant expansion of the village, with new houses and community buildings constructed. Thornton became an urban district council in 1900, surviving until 1974 when it became part of the Wyre Borough Council. Transport Thornton for Cleveleys railway station was formerly the principal intermediate stop on the Fleetwood branch of the LMS/British Rail London Midland Region railway, running from Poulton-le-Fylde, but it has been years since the station was used, and with the recent fencing-over of the level crossing in Station Road/Victoria Road East in order to prevent youths from congregating on the tracks, the glory days of Thornton are long since gone. However, a decision by an action group based in Poulton means they will finance a feasibility study into bringing the railway back to Thornton and Fleetwood. Amenities Marsh Mill, a large, well-preserved windmill built in 1794, is a prominent landmark. It was commissioned by Bold Hesketh, uncle of Peter Hesketh (later Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood), who would go on to play a prominent role in the expansion of Fleetwood. Tragedy struck in May 1930, when a Miss Alice Baldwin and a Mrs Mary Jane Bailey visited the windmill with an interest in purchasing it. However, when both women stepped onto the fantail platform, the platform collapsed and the women fell to their deaths. Thornton contains a number of schools, including Baines Endowed Primary School, Thornton Primary School, Stanah Primary School, Royles Brook Primary School and Millfield Science and Performing Arts College. The public library, situated at Four Lane Ends, was closed down in the autumn of 2016 as a result of cost-cutting measures by Lancashire County Council. This decisions was hugely unpopular and despite protests and a petition, the decision to close the library wasn't initially overturned, but the library reopened in February 2018 after the decision was reversed. Sport Thornton-Cleveleys is home to Thornton- Cleveleys R.U.F.C. who play rugby in the RFU Northern Division, North Lancs 1. Their home ground is the YMCA sport centre in Thornton. Thornton-Cleveleys F.C. play in the West Lancashire Football League, they play their home matches at New Bourne Park.http://www.thorntoncleveleysfc.org The town boasts two cricket clubs - Thornton-Cleveleys C.C. and Norcross C.C. both playing in the Moore & Smalley Palace Shield competition and both having three senior sides and several junior teams in a variety of age groups.

For breast cancer it is often used together with docetaxel. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, and rashes. Other severe side effects include blood clotting problems, allergic reactions, heart problems such as cardiomyopathy, and low blood cell counts. It is not recommended in people with kidney problems. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Capecitabine, inside the body, is converted to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) through which it acts. It belongs to the class of medications known as fluoropyrimidines, which also includes 5-fluorouracil and tegafur. Capecitabine was patented in 1992 and approved for medical use in 1998. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses It is used in the treatment of the following cancers: * Colorectal cancer (either as neoadjuvant therapy with radiation, adjuvant therapy or for metastatic cases) * Breast cancer (metastatic or as monotherapy/combotherapy; this is licensed as a second-line treatment in the UK) * Gastric cancer (off-label in the US; this is a licensed indication in the UK) * Oesophageal cancer (off-label in the US) Adverse effects Adverse effects by frequency: ;Very common (>10% frequency): * Appetite loss * Diarrhea * Vomiting * Nausea * Stomatitis * Abdominal pain * Fatigue * Weakness * Hand-foot syndromeReddening, swelling, numbness and desquamation on palms and soles * Oedema * Fever * Pain * Headache * Hair loss * Dermatitis * Indigestion * Shortness of breath * Eye irritation * MyelosuppressionIncludes: anaemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia Notes on adverse effects: =Contraindications= Contraindications include: * History of hypersensitivity to fluorouracil, capecitabine or any of its excipients * DPD deficiency (see Pharmacogenetics) * Pregnancy and lactation * Severe leucopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia * Severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment * Treatment with sorivudine or its chemically related analogues, such as brivudine =Drug interactions= Drugs it is known to interact with include: * Sorivudine or its analogues, such as, brivudine. * CYP2C9 substrates, including, warfarin and other coumarin-derivatives anticoagulants * Phenytoin, as it increases the plasma concentrations of phenytoin. * Calcium folinate may enhance the therapeutic effects of capecitabine by means of synergising with its metabolite, 5-FU. It may also induce more severe diarrhoea by means of this synergy. =Pharmacogenetics= The dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme is responsible for the detoxifying metabolism of fluoropyrimidines, a class of drugs that includes capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil and tegafur. Genetic variations within the DPD gene (DPYD) can lead to reduced or absent DPD activity, and individuals who are heterozygous or homozygous for these variations may have partial or complete DPD deficiency; an estimated 0.2% of individuals have complete DPD deficiency. Those with partial or complete DPD deficiency have a significantly increased risk of severe or even fatal drug toxicities when treated with fluoropyrimidines; examples of toxicities include myelosuppression, neurotoxicity and hand-foot syndrome. Mechanism of action Capecitabine is metabolised to 5-FU which in turn is a thymidylate synthase inhibitor, hence inhibiting the synthesis of thymidine monophosphate (ThMP), the active form of thymidine which is required for the de novo synthesis of DNA.

He joined Woolwich Arsenal as manager in February 1908, having joined the club from Morton. Although in his first full season he helped the team finish sixth in the League, with low attendances the club had fallen into debt and had to sell many of their best players, with stars such as Tim Coleman, Bert Freeman, Jimmy Sharp, Jimmy Ashcroft and William Garbutt all leaving during 1908. Although Morrell led the club to 6th place in 1908-09, at the time an all-time best, after that the club declined, finishing 18th the next. In 1910 Arsenal were taken over by Sir Henry Norris but despite speculation he would be sacked, Morrell continued in his post. Arsenal rallied to finish 10th, in mid- table, for both the 1910-11 and 1911-12 seasons. Morrell applied for the job of Leeds City manager in the 1912 close season but dropped out of the running after being dissuaded by the Arsenal board; the job went instead to Herbert Chapman, who would one day manage Arsenal. Unfortunately for Morrell, by staying he oversaw a massive drop of form in 1912-13. Woolwich Arsenal eventually finished bottom of the First Division, giving Morrell the distinction of being the only Arsenal manager to have overseen a relegation. Despite relegation, Arsenal, who had by now moved to the new Arsenal Stadium, Highbury, retained Morrell and under him they came close to automatic promotion, finishing third in the Second Division in 1913-14 (missing out on second on goal average) and then fifth in 1914-15. This placing was high enough to get them eventually elected back into the expanded First Division in 1919, when competitive football resumed after the conclusion of World War I; however, Wolves and Barnsley had finished higher that season and were not granted promotion. Arsenal's return to the First Division appears to have been mainly thanks to political machinations by their chairman, Henry Norris, rather than their performance.Soar & Tyler (2005), pp.39-40 By then, Morrell was no longer Arsenal manager; after having been told he was due to be sacked at the end of the 1914-15 season due to the suspension of football due to World War I, he resigned on or around 19 April 1915. He returned to Scotland to manage Third Lanark and his fate after that is unknown.

In professional wrestling a DDT is any move in which the wrestler has the opponent in a front facelock/inverted headlock and falls down or backwards to drive the opponent's head into the mat. The classic DDT is performed by putting the opponent in a front facelock and falling backwards so that the opponent is forced to dive forward onto their head. Although widely credited as an invention of Jake Roberts, who gave the DDT its famous name, the earliest known practitioner of the move was Mexican wrestler Black Gordman, who frequently performed it during the 1970s. Rumors abound as to what the letters DDT supposedly stood for, including Damien's Death Trap, Damien's Death Touch, Damien's Dinner Time (all named after Jake's pet python, Damien), Drape Drop Takedown, Drop Down Town and Death Drop Technique. When asked what DDT meant, Jake once famously replied \\"The End.\\" The abbreviation itself originally came from the chemical dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, a notorious pesticide, as stated during shoot interviews and Jake's Pick Your Poison DVD. Variations =Front facelock variants= Argentine DDT The wrestler lifts the opponent onto their shoulders as in an Argentine backbreaker rack and pushes the opponent's legs while still holding the front facelock, flipping them over to the front of the wrestler. The wrestler falls down to the mat front-first, driving the opponent face-first down to the mat. The move was innovated by Kenta Kobashi. Armbar DDT Also called a single arm DDT, this variation of the armbreaker involves the attacking wrestler grabbing the opponent's left or right arm, holding it across their chest, and then falling backwards, dropping the opponent face-first as well as damaging the opponent's arm and shoulder. Cradle DDT Paige setting up the Ram-Paige on Brie Bella The wrestler applies a front facelock to the opponent, then lifts the opponent into an elevated leg-trap bodyscissors position, and finally fall backwards, driving the opponent head first down to the mat. WWE wrestler Paige uses this variation as a finishing move called the Ram-Paige. A variation, known as a hammerlock cradle DDT, involves the attacking wrestler lifting the opponent into a bear hug, applying a hammerlock, then a front facelock, then finally driving the opponent's head into the mat. British wrestler Joseph Conners uses this variation, known as the Righteous Kill, and Nia Jax has been utilizing a version of the move since her return from injury. Double underhook DDT Dean Ambrose performing the Dirty Deeds on John Cena; he later reverted to his Jon Moxley moniker and changed the name of the Dirty Deeds to the Paradigm Shift or the Death Rider Innovated by Kenta Kobashi. Instead of applying a head or facelock, the wrestler bends the opponent forward and hooks each arm behind the opponent's head, a position known as a butterfly. The wrestler then tucks the opponent's head under one of their arms and falls back to pull the opponent down either flat on their face, which is the more common variant, or onto the top of their head, causing them to roll over like in a regular DDT. It is also known as a double arm DDT or a butterfly DDT. Mick Foley, Stevie Richards, Drew McIntyre, and Jon Moxley have all popularized variations of this DDT: Foley used an unnamed jumping version, Richards uses a lifting version he calls the Stevie-T, McIntyre used a snap version called the Future Shock, and Moxley uses a lift-and-snap version called Dirty Deeds. Diving DDT The wrestler stands in an elevated position (usually on the top rope) and faces the standing or bent-over opponent. As they dive, the wrestler wraps their near arm around the opponent's head in a front facelock and swings themselves backwards in midair, landing back-first and simultaneously forcing the opponent's head into the mat. It is used by Yoshinobu Kanemaru as The Deep Impact. Elevated DDT Randy Orton performing an elevated DDT on Sheamus This version of a DDT first sees an attacking wrestler place the opponent on an elevated surface, usually the ropes or the turnbuckle, while applying a front facelock. The attacking wrestler next draws the opponent away from the elevated surface leaving the opponent's feet over the elevated surface (i.e. ring ropes), making them the only thing other than the wrestler keeping the opponent off the ground. The attacking wrestler then falls backwards so that the opponent is forced to dive forward onto their head with extra force due to the height of which they were dropped. This can also be performed as a double team move. A slight variation, known as a diving DDT or a Halo DDT, exists and sees the wrestler and the opponent both on an elevated surface, albeit with the wrestler facing the ring. With the opponent in the front facelock, the wrestler and the opponent both dive off the elevated surface, resulting in the wrestler falling forward to perform the DDT instead of falling backwards. The move is sometimes referred to as a spike DDT, because the defending wrestler lands in an upside-down, almost completely vertical position (known as the \\"spiked\\" position, which refers to when a wrestler is actually dropped vertically upside down). This move is usually performed with the defending wrestler's feet on the middle rope, sometimes to an opponent attempting to enter the ring. Tommaso Ciampa uses this move as his finisher; he calls it \\"Willows Bell\\". Facebreaker DDT The wrestler applies a front facelock and then falls backwards, much like a normal DDT, but instead of the opponent's head impacting the mat, the wrestler falls to a kneeling or sitting position driving the face of the opponent on to their knee. Flip DDT Also known as a front flip DDT. After applying a front facelock, the wrestler pushes off the mat with their legs to flip the opponent and drive them onto the top of their head in a manner similar to the flip piledriver. It was used by Will Ospreay as finishing move on rare occasions. Flip-over DDT Also known as a Samurai Driver, this DDT sees a wrestler place their head between the thighs of an opponent before jumping up while pushing away from the opponent's thighs to flip up and sit on the shoulders of the opponent. The wrestler then spreads their legs, dropping off the opponent's shoulders as they grab hold of the opponent's head in a front facelock to fall down to the mat back first, driving the opponent's head down to the mat. This move sees the attacking wrestler get lifted in a powerbomb position so often this move is used as a counter to a powerbomb. Float-over DDT This DDT sees the wrestler stand in front of the opponent facing them, duck, hook one of their arms over the opponent's shoulder (if it is the opponent's left shoulder that the attacker chooses to seize, they hooks with their right, or opposite if sides are reversed), swing under the opponent's armpit, then around and over the opponent's back so that they face the same way as the opponent, lock the opponent's head under his other hand's armpit, spin another 180¬∞ to end up having the opponent locked in a front facelock, and fall back to drive the opponent skull-first to the mat, as in a regular DDT. The maneuver is usually performed after the attacker ducks a punch or a clothesline. Flowing DDT A variant of the DDT popularized by Raven, the attacking wrestler kicks the opponent in the stomach before applying a front facelock and falling backwards to drive the opponent's head into the mat. Fireman's carry DDT Also described as a fireman's carry implant DDT, this move sees the attacking wrestler first put an opponent up in the fireman's carry (across the wrestler's shoulders) position, then throw the opponent's legs out in front of them to spin them out while the attacking wrestler switches the position of their arm holding the opponent's head to a front facelock and falls backwards to drive the top of the opponent's head into the mat. Fisherman DDT After applying a front facelock, the wrestler hooks the opponent's near leg with their other arm, slightly hoists them up, and falls backwards onto their back, driving the opponent's head down to the mat. Headscissors DDT Very different from a classic or traditional DDT, as the wrestler never uses their hand in this variation. The wrestler catches the opponent in a standing headscissors and then falls backwards, slamming the opponent into the mat face-first. Also often referred to as the Hurricanrana Driver . Hammerlock DDT Variation of a classic DDT in which the wrestler first applies a hammerlock on the opponent's further arm, goes for a front facelock, and then falls backwards onto their back, driving the opponent's head down to the mat. Andrade uses this move as a finisher, he calls La Sombra. Tessa Blanchard also uses a variant of the Move called Buzzsaw. Dolph Ziggler performing the Jumping DDT on Alberto Del Rio Jumping DDT A slight variation where instead of just falling backwards, the wrestler jumps up while holding the front facelock and then uses the weight and momentum to pull the opponent down on their head. Also, a variation of this move is sometimes seen where, as the wrestler jumps, they use the horizontal position to execute a front dropkick to the knees of the opponent to add additional impact to the move. Legsweep DDT Also known as the Russian legsweep DDT. In these versions of a DDT the wrestler applies a front facelock and then performs a type of legsweep to essentially take out the legs from under the opponent before falling backwards to drive the opponent face first down to the mat. Lifting DDT This version of a DDT is similar to a spike DDT and is often referred to as a low angle brainbuster, or simply as an implant DDT. The attacking wrestler applies a front facelock to an opponent then lifts the opponent off the ground just before falling backwards to drive the opponent face or head first down to the mat. A slight variation of this sees the wrestler spin the opponent's body away from themselves as they raise the opponent off the ground. Another version, the lifting inverted DDT, sees the wrestler apply an inverted facelock, lift the opponent off the ground and fall back. This move was popularized by Gangrel during his stint in WWE as his finishing move, called the Impaler DDT, and was later adopted by Edge, who called it the Edgecution. It is currently performed by Robert Roode, who uses a swinging variation as a finishing move, calling it the Glorious DDT. Moonwalk DDT With the opponent placed in a front facelock, the attacking wrestler performs a Moonwalk maneuver across the ring and then proceeds to execute a classic DDT slam. Over the shoulder DDT The attacking wrestler puts the opponent over the shoulder as in a powerslam set up but instead throws them off and around their body grabbing their head and executing a modified DDT or a modified facebuster. Running DDT The wrestler charges at a bent-forward opponent and applies a front facelock before dropping backwards to drive the opponent down to the mat head first. In another variation the wrestler will also push the opponent up with their free arm, performing a spike DDT version of the move. Scissored DDT This move sees the wrestler apply the front facelock and then put one of their legs on one of the opponent's arms before falling backward and driving the opponent head first to the mat. Shooting star DDT The opponent is facing the wrestler on the turnbuckle. The wrestler then does a backflip towards the opponent catching the opponent into a DDT on the way down. Single underhook DDT The wrestler places the opponent in a front facelock and hooks only one of the opponent's arms behind their neck, as if going for a suplex, before falling back and driving the opponent's head into the mat. A variation of this move sees the wrestler lift the opponent off the ground after applying the underhook, before falling back to drive the opponent head first down to the mat. This lifting variation was popularized by Prince Devitt, who used it as a finisher under the name of Bloody Sunday and the 1916 as Finn B√°lor. Slingshot DDT The wrestler stands on the ring apron and performs a slingshot, and as they pull themselves over the top rope, they grab their opponent in a front facelock and fall backwards, driving their opponent's head into the mat. Johnny Gargano uses it as the One Final Beat. Snap DDT The wrestler applies a front facelock to their opponent. The wrestler then jumps down onto their back, swinging their legs forward, bending the opponent, and driving them down to the mat face, forehead, or head first. A slight variation sees the wrestler draw one of their legs backwards (usually the leg closest to the opponent) before swinging it forward to build extra momentum. They then drop onto their back, driving the opponent head first to the mat. Yujiro Takahashi performs a variation where he delivers the DDT to a kneeling opponent, calling his version Pimp Juice. Maryse Mizanin used this move and dubbed it the French Kiss. Alexa Bliss uses it and calls it the Bliss DDT. Spike DDT The wrestler applies a front facelock to the opponent and lifts them up with their free arm. The wrestler then falls backwards, driving the opponent vertically down to the mat head first. The Spike DDT is a version of the DDT which is somewhere between a lifting DDT and a brainbuster. It was used by Shinya Hashimoto. Tilt-a-whirl DDT This variation sees the charging wrestler being spun into a tilt-a-whirl and ends the move up into a DDT. An inverted variation is also possible. Tornado DDT The tornado DDT is also referred to as a swinging/spinning DDT. A wrestler goes to the top rope and applies a front facelock to an opponent from an elevated position (for example, sitting on the top turnbuckle against an opponent standing on the mat, or from the apron against an opponent standing on the ground). The wrestler then jumps forward and swings around to fall backwards and drop the opponent's head into the mat. Standing tornado DDT In this version the fighter charges an opponent standing, jumps and applies the front facelock in the air before swinging and falling backwards having the opponent hit face first or head first into the canvas. This is sometimes known as a jumping swinging DDT and is used regularly by fighters who use a standard tornado DDT. Mickie James popularized this move under the name Mickie-DT. =Inverted facelock variants= This subsection lists DDTs that involve the opponent being dropped on the back of their heads. The basic inverted DDT is also known as an inverted DDT. Inverted DDT Commonly known as the reverse DDT. A wrestler applies an inverted facelock to the opponent, then falls backward, driving the back of the opponent's head into the mat. The move was popularized by Sting in the late 1990s after he adopted it as his new finisher and named it the Scorpion Death Drop. Falling inverted DDT A wrestler applies an inverted facelock. Then the attacker throws their feet backwards, falling onto their own stomach. The defending wrestler has the back of their head driven into the mat. Popularized by Christian Cage. Half nelson inverted DDT The attacking wrestler applies an inverted facelock and puts their arm under the opponent's arm, completing the half nelson, and drops down with the opponent's head driven into the mat. Sting setting up the Scorpion Death Drop (Inverted DDT) on Bo Dallas Lifting inverted DDT The wrestler applies an inverted facelock on the opponent with one arm, and lifts the opponent up with the other. The wrestler then falls backwards down onto their back, slightly to their side, driving the opponent down to the mat upper back and head first. This move is sometimes incorrectly referred to as an inverted DDT or a reverse DDT. Another variation used can be done where the wrestler falls on their stomach instead of their back, which is known as a lifting falling inverted DDT. Dustin Rhodes uses this move as the Curtain Call. Shiranui KL Murphy performing a shiranui Also known as a springboard backflip three-quarter facelock inverted DDT. A wrestler puts the opponent into a ¬æ facelock, then runs up the corner turnbuckles or ring ropes and jump backwards performing a backflip, and landing face down driving the opponent down to the mat back-first. Sometimes a standing variant is performed by wrestlers with adequate leaping ability or when assisted by a tag team partner.The move is popularly known, especially in North America, as Sliced Bread No. 2, a name created by wrestler Brian Kendrick. In a slight variation named the sitout shiranui the wrestler lands into a seated position instead, driving the opponent's head between the legs. Snap inverted DDT A wrestler applies an inverted facelock to the opponent, swings either their legs for momentum, and then falls backward, driving the back of the opponent's head into the mat. Used by Lance Archer. Standing shiranui Kalisto performing the Salida del Sol (backflip three-quarter facelock inverted DDT) Also known as a backflip three-quarter facelock inverted DDT. In this move a wrestler applies a three-quarter facelock on the opponent and performs a backflip over the opponent while maintaining the facelock turning it into an inverted facelock and then either landing face down to the mat, on their own back to the side, on their knees, or in a sitting position, to drive the opponent's head back-first down to the mat. This move has several names, usually depending on the person performing it. The official name of the move used to be the Asai DDT as it was innovated by √öltimo Drag√≥n. A sitout variation is also used. NJPW wrestler Tetsuya Naito uses a modified version of this move called the Destino which sees him grabbing and underhooking an opponent's single right arm with his right arm from behind while reaching under the outstretched right arm to take hold the opponent's head with his left arm while running a few short steps forward to jump performing while a backflip maintaining his hold on his opponent thus executing the maneuver. Swinging inverted DDT This variation sees a wrestler lock in a front facelock and, while falling backwards, twist their opponent around resulting in the opponent landing on the back of their head, as in a standing inverted DDT. The same technique can be used to end in a falling inverted DDT. A slight variation of this sees the wrestler reach under the opponent while setting up the move to grab their far arm. From there, the wrestler pulls the arm over, causing the opponent to twist around until they are in an inverted facelock before then dropping backwards for a standard inverted DDT. Tilt-a-whirl inverted DDT Similar to the normal tilt-a-whirl DDT. This DDT sees the charging wrestler being tilt-a-whirled by the opponent, after the maneuver is over, the wrestler holds the opponent into an inverted facelock, and then falling backwards while he's elevated off the mat into an inverted DDT. Tornado inverted DDT The attacking wrestler applies an inverted facelock from an elevated position (for example, sitting on the top turnbuckle against an opponent standing on the mat, or from the apron against an opponent standing on the ground). They then jump off so that they swing around the opponent. Using the momentum from the jump, they falls forward and slam the back of the opponent's head into the mat. A standing jumping reverse tornado version of the move is also possible.

Carl Franz Bally (October 24, 1821, Sch√∂nenwerd ‚Äì August 5, 1899) was a Swiss businessman who founded the Bally Shoe company in 1851.  Early life  Carl Franz Bally was the 11th of 14 children of Peter Bally (1783‚Äì1849) and Anna Maria Herzog. His grandfather, Franz Ulrich Bohli (1748‚Äì1810) immigrated as a young man from Vorarlberg in west part of Austria to Sch√∂nenwerd in the Canton of Solothurn in Switzerland, working as a mason for a manufacturer of silk ribbons. Later, he established his own silk ribbon manufacture in that town, relying mostly on work outsourced to local weavers. His sons Peter and Niklaus continued and enlarged the firm producing also suspenders and elastic fabrics and building an extensive second facility in S√§ckingen, Germany.  Career  Carl Franz, one of the ten sons of Peter, entered the business at age 17 concentrating on the newest products. During a business trip to Paris he visited a shoe manufacturing plant and began to think about producing shoes, founding his own small facility in 1851. After initial difficulties the business began to flourish and in the early 1870s he established sales organizations in Buenos Aires (Argentina), Montevideo, (Uruguay) and Paris, (France). To fill the need for workers he opened small manufacturing facilities in several towns in the surrounding region. By 1880 Bally had transformed Sch√∂nenwerd from a sleepy farm village to an industrial center offering employment to hundreds of workers from the surrounding area, ultimately developing it into one of the w‚Äôs leading shoe manufacturing enterprises. Around the turn of the century, the firm employed some 3200 workers and produced over two million pairs of shoes a year. He also served as a lawmaker in various local and federal positions.  Social initiatives  Carl Franz was a progressive liberal, pushing forward many new ideas in the town, now taken for granted. He and his wife opened a special education school for girls, a kindergarten, an old-age home and a public swimming facility at the bordering Aare river. He built homes for workers and converted a flood region of the Aare in town into a luscious, publicly accessible park. He fought battles to break the long established bond between school education and religion and supported the establishment of improved schooling facilities for grade schools and a regional middle school.  Personal life  Carl Franz and his wife Cecile Rychner (1823‚Äì1893) had two sons, Eduard and Arthur, who continued their father‚Äôs business under the name C. F. Bally S√∂hne. Carl Franz Bally died in Basel in 1899. Further reading # O. von D√§niken, Sch√∂nenwerd, Olten: Walter-Verlag, 1974 # C.

It is also designated by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas as the country's national ATM network. BancNet is also the exclusive gateway of China's UnionPay, allowing access to the nearly 1 billion ATM cardholders from China. BancNet is allied with global payment brand JCB International. Through this alliance, JCB cardholders can now do cash advances at participating BancNet member ATMs nationwide. Bancnet interconnects with international card networks Diners Club, Discover Card, KFTC, MasterCard, and VISA. BancNet serves more than 41 million ATM cardholders of its 124 members and affiliates with over 21,000 ATMs and more than 304,000 POS terminals. In 2008, Expressnet outsourced its ATM operations to BancNet. On January 30, 2015, BancNet and MegaLink announced their merger and will retain itself as its brand. History BancNet was founded on July 17, 1990 as the Philippines' second ATM consortium when the ATMs of eight banks, PCI Bank (later Equitable PCI Bank, now Banco de Oro), Security Bank, Chinabank, RCBC, Allied Bank (now part of PNB), Metrobank, International Exchange Bank (now part of UnionBank) and CityTrust Banking Corp. (now part of BPI) formed BancNet. Other members have since joined. In 1994, BancNet introduced the a point-of-sale system to serve the retail payment requirements of cardholders. In 1997, BancNet started offering website hosting, email and surfing services to member banks at affordable rates. In 2002, BancNet started its online banking and payment gateway system. It was during the anniversary business forum of 2002 that BancNet introduced Interbank Funds Transfer, reportedly the first consortium-run automated transfer facility in the region. The product allows real-time, online transfer of money among the members of BancNet using either the payment gateway, the ATM or a cardholder's cellular phone. A partnership with Globe Telecom, the second largest telecoms company in the Philippines, in 2006 allowed BancNet to expand ATM-like functions to the mobile phones of cardholders. This was followed by a similar agreement in early 2007 with Smart Communications, the dominant telecoms company, for mobile banking. A Memorandum of Agreement was signed in 2007 with Nationlink, admitting the latter as the first network alliance member of BancNet. This allows all the rural bank members of Nationlink to enjoy the convenience of electronic banking on 8,000 ATMs and more than 10,000 Point-of-Sale terminals nationwide.

Helix editor Stuart Moore had worried the original name of Caleb Newcastle was \\"too British\\", so the collaborators settled on Spider Jerusalem. Robertson now faced a difficult choice in turning down the opportunity to draw Spider-Man monthly. A close friend pointed out to Robertson that choosing Transmetropolitan would mean he has a book that was always his, while choosing Spider-Man could make Robertson just another Spider-Man artist. Recalling his experiences with Malibu, Robertson chose the project where he would own the work. Ironically, despite Ellis's enthusiasm for Robertson's work, and the hard choice he made turning down Spider-Man, Robertson had difficulty overcoming an initial editorial perception that he was a superhero artist. Yet after a number of concept sketches and taking a firm stand, and submitting the first four pages of pencils for the first issue, Robertson was confirmed as the book's artist. Robertson described the Transmetropolitan process as \\"a real collaboration [‚Ä¶] unlike anything I've ever worked on before because there are things that I added that were never a part of the script.\\" Notable contributions from Robertson include the idea of television buy bombs and the notorious Sex Puppets. Robertson even modeled Spider's ex-wife on his own wife, operating under the request that if she was drawn into the book, she didn't want the character to be anything like herself. Robertson is also behind the creation of Transmetropolitan's iconic gecko eating two headed cat. Robertson drew the cat into an alley panel after considering what strays might exist in the future. After seeing the sketch co-creator Ellis declared \\"let's make it [Spider‚Äôs] pet.\\" Writing for Wired magazine, Cory Doctorow called Transmetropolitan \\"the graphic novel of the decade.\\"Doctorow, Cory. \\"Exit Transmet: Graphic Novel of the Decade Fades to Black\\" WIRED magazine; December 2002 Notable fans of Transmetropolitan include Patrick Stewart, Robin Williams,Worley, Rob. Transmetropolitan \\"COMICS2FILM\\" Comic Book Resources; May 30, 2001 and writer/director Darren Aronofsky.Aronofsky, Darren. Forward to Transmetropolitan Vol 7: Spider's Trash Robertson called working on Transmetropolitan a rewarding experience, citing the critical acclaim, continued popularity of the charactersBrady, Matt. \\"Darick Robertson on The Boys\\" Newsarama; August 20, 2008 and unique fandom. Robertson expresses fond memories of Ellis's scripts but he has no desire to return to Transmetropolitan. When the book ended he found no longer operating under the book's constant tight deadlines was a great relief. After DC shut the Helix label down, Transmetropolitan moved to Vertigo, with issue 7, where it ran for 60 issues. =Return to Marvel= In 2002, after Transmetropolitan ended, Robertson found his schedule opening up again for new projects. Former Transmetropolitan editor Axel Alonso approached Robertson with the opportunity for an exclusive deal at Marvel Comics. Robertson was instrumental in Marvel's launch of the Marvel MAX mature imprint. Alongside writer Garth Ennis, who Robertson had met through Warren Ellis, Robertson worked on Fury, a hard-edged modern take on the seminal Marvel comics spy character Nick Fury which Rolling Stone hailed as \\"cool comic of the year\\". Robertson and Ennis developed a solid working partnership and would re-team again on a number of projects including a follow-up miniseries depicting Nick Fury during World War II entitled Fury: Peacemaker. Darick also illustrated Spider-Man: Sweet Charity with veteran television writer Ron Zimmerman. Robertson referred to the book as \\"his best Spider-Man work to date.\\" Robertson soon collaborated again with Garth Ennis, illustrating the Ennis's 2002 run on the Marvel Knights Punisher series, in which Wolverine was mutilated by little people The next major collaboration between Robertson and Garth Ennis was Punisher: Born. Originally planned as Punisher: The War Where I Was Born, for the Ultimate line, the book instead became the new origin of Marvel's signature vigilante, and the starting point for Ennis's run the Punisher series published under Marvel's MAX imprint. Nightcrawler by Darick Robertson X-Men Next, in 2003, Robertson was offered the opportunity to re-launch Wolverine alongside writer Greg Rucka. Robertson, a fan of Wolverine since discovering the character at age 12, accepted the offer, citing a desire to work on the high-profile X-Man for a long time. The new Wolverine series launched at number one in Diamond Comics May 2003 sales charts selling over 160,000 copies.\\"Marvel Sales: June 2003 Estimates\\" ICV2 Some controversy emerged during Robertson and Greg Rucka's run in regards to a mandate to replace Wolverine's classic squat design, which Robertson sought to develop and refine, with a design based on the 20th Century Fox X-Men movie franchise look of Wolverine portrayed by Hugh Jackman. Robertson states the Marvel request made him unhappy, but it was a company-wide choice and did not require his work to mimic the appearance of the actor exactly.Naso, Markisan. \\"Darick Robertson: Into the Night\\" ; Comics Bulletin; Accessed July 25, 2010 Darick Robertson worked on Wolverine (Volume 3) for 14 issues. Following his work on Wolverine, Darick Robertson moved directly to another high-profile X-Men project. Robertson, a stated lifelong fan of X-Man character Nightcrawler, was nominated by Marvel Editor Cebulski, Robertson's collaborator on X-Men Unlimited, as the artist for the fan- favorite character's first ongoing series. Robertson, who had once dressed as the teleporting X-Man for Halloween, said at the time, \\"I never imagined I'd be so lucky as to move onto a Nightcrawler series on the heels of Wolverine, so in some ways it's still a childhood dream manifesting.\\" Working with series writer and playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Robertson aimed to bring the classic swashbuckler aspects of the character back to the forefront as well as explore deeper spiritual aspects of the Catholic hero. In addition to pencils Robertson took the series as an opportunity to further develop his craft in inking his own work. Nightcrawler ran 12 issues. =The Boys= While Robertson expressed disappointment in not being able to continue working on childhood favorites for Marvel, with the cancellation of Nightcrawler and his departure from Wolverine, Robertson took the opportunity to resign from his exclusivity at Marvel and reunite with Garth Ennis on a project proposed 4 years before. This project would be a super hero satire called The Boys. Ennis had the project in mind for a number of years, and The Boys would permit Darick extensive creative control with the opportunity to produce an original work where he could design the characters, create the covers, and continue inking his own material.Saunders, Steven G. \\"Darick Robertson: Just One of the Boys\\" Comics Bulletin; Accessed July 25, 2010 The Boys, far from a simple story poking fun at superheroes would be an \\"allegory about absolute power corrupting absolutely.\\"Amacker, Kurt. \\"Hanging with the Boys: Ten Questions for Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson\\" ; Comicscape; August 23, 2006 To promote The Boys launch, and acting alongside comic store Isotope, Robertson gave away 10 original sketches of The Boys cast kicking the ass of the winner's choice of superhero.Brady, Matt. \\"Want to see your fave Superhero get a beatdown from The Boys?\\" Newsarama; August 15, 2006Sime, James. \\"Somebody‚Äôs Gonna Get Their Head Kicked in Tonight: First Five Winners Announced in Darick Robertson‚Äôs Beat Down\\" Isotope Comics; August 21, 2006 In response to this project DC/Wildstorm offered Darick an exclusive contract which would also see him working on Batman and the re-launch of The Authority. However, after six issues under the DC/Wildstorm imprint the publisher elected to cancel the book despite critical acclaim and fan buzz. Robertson stated \\"it became obvious that DC was not the right home for The Boys,\\"Brady, Matt. \\"The Boys Ends at Wildstorm\\" Newsarama; January 24, 2007 though he thanked Scott Dunbier and Ben Abernathy at Wildstorm for their support. After DC released the rights for the book back to the creators, Robertson was granted an exception to his exclusivity deal so he could continue working on projects for DC, Wildstorm and Vertigo while The Boys found a new publisher.Brady, Matt. \\"The Boys Continues in June\\" Newsarama; March 3, 2007 The Boys did not lack a home long as it was soon after picked up by Dynamite Entertainment in February 2007.Brady, Matt. \\"The Boys Land @ Dynamite Entertainment\\" Newsarama February 7, 2007 In 2008 The Boys was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series as well as a GLAAD Media Award,\\"GLAAD Glad Name Media Award Nominees\\" Queerty; January 21, 2008 and is now under development through Kickstart Entertainment and Original Film for Columbia Pictures.Siegel, Tatiana. \\"Columbia, Moritz call on 'The Boys' Variety; February 20, 2008 Subsequently, Columbia put The Boys into turnaround and it was picked up by Paramount Pictures Darick left the monthly art chores on The Boys with issue 43.Brady, Matt. \\"The Boys & Darick Robertson ‚Äì With Exclusive Preview\\" Newsarama, August 8, 2008 Darick focused his attention on the six issue origin story \\"Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker\\" that focused on the BOYS central character Billy Butcher. The collected 6 issues made the New York Times bestseller list in April 2012. In November 2012, the final issue of The BOYS was released with issue #72. Robertson returned to draw the finale with art assistance from Richard P. Clark. =Conan The Barbarian= Robertson wrote and drew The Weight of the Crown, a Conan The Barbarian one-shot for Dark Horse comics, released in January 2010, as well as a 16-page prequel to the story, originally published by Dark Horse Presents entitled \\"The Mad King Of Gaul\\". He also wrote: The CBLDF Presents Liberty Annual 2010 (2010) Annual 2010, The CBLDF Presents: Liberty Comics (2008), Annual 2010 (Conan Variant), Malibu Signature Series (1993) #2, Mantra (1993) #10 - 'The coming of the inquisitors', Marvel Knights: Millennial Visions (2002)#1, MySpace Dark Horse Presents (2007) TPB vol. 05 - 'Volume Five', #28 The New Warriors (1990) Annual 03 & Annual 04, Power Rangers (1995), Ripfire (1995) #0 - 'Genesis', Rune (1994) #3 - 'The Spoils of War', Space Beaver (1986) #1 - #11, Spider-Man (1990) Super Special 1, Spider-Man Team-Up (1995) #5, Spiderman/New Warriors: Fuerzas de la Oscuridad (1994)#4, - 'La Insoportable Oscuridad del Ser', Ultraverse Premiere (1993). =HAPPY!= In 2012 Image Comics released the four issue mini series HAPPY! co-created with Eisner Award-winning writer Grant Morrison. Critically acclaimed and best selling, HAPPY! marks the first collaboration of Image Comics, Grant Morrison and Darick Robertson. The story centered around a beat down New York Detective turned hitman, Nick Sax, who awakes from a heart attack to a conversation with a perpetually upbeat \\"Unipixisus\\" (as named by Robertson's son), who calls himself \\"Happy The Horse\\" and takes the shape of a little blue flying donkey with a Unicorn horn. The creature is a little girl's imaginary friend and she is in danger. Only Nick Sax can save her as only Nick can see or hear Happy. It's an unusual buddy story and caught the attention of The RZA and Producer Reginald Hudlin who have expressed their desire to adapt the comic into a film. Harry Knowles' \\"Ain't It Cool News\\" announced Darick Robertson as one of their BEST ARTIST picks for their 9th Annual AICN COMICS @$$IE AWARDS, citing his work on HAPPY!. =BALLISTIC= In 2013 Robertson launched the 5 issue series BALLISTIC \\"a psychedelic, transreal, hard sci-fi adventure\\"Black Mask Studios with co-creator and writer Adam Egypt Mortimer, from Black Mask Studios. The series was well reviewed but struggled to find an audience on its initial release. A collection is due in 2015. =OLIVER= OLIVER is a steam-punk inspired reinterpretation of the classic Oliver Twist, set in a post apocalyptic London. It is being co-created with writer Gary Whitta based on a screenplay he wrote in 2001. OLIVER is set be published by Image Comics in 2015. Personal life Robertson currently lives in California with his wife and two children. He enjoys creating custom action figures, writing music, singing and playing the guitar.

Thomson was the first settler in the area known as Belmont, a suburb of Geelong and called his homestead Kardinia, a property now listed on the Register of the National Estate. Early life Thomson was the son of Alexander Thomson, a shipowner of Aberdeen, Scotland, baptised 28 March 1798. He was educated at Dr Todd's school at Tichfield, Aberdeen University, and at London, where he studied under Sir Everard Home and qualified for the medical profession. In March 1824 he married Barbara Dalrymple. Emigration to colonial Australia In 1825 Thomson sailed to Tasmania (then Van Diemen's Land) as a surgeon on a convict ship, the first of several voyages made by him. He was then in comfortable circumstances having been left a sum of ¬£9500 by his mother. In 1831 he decided to settle in Tasmania, and bringing with him his wife and daughter, obtained a grant of 4000 acres (16 km¬≤) of land. In 1832 Thomson bought two small steamers and established a service between Hobart and Kangaroo Point. He, however, sold both vessels during the next two years. He became interested in the colonisation of Port Phillip District, but did not join the Port Phillip Association, though invited to do so, and in November 1835 he sent across the first cattle to arrive in the new settlement, a draft of 50 Hereford cows. In March 1836 Thomson arrived with his wife and daughter. He came over as medical officer and catechist for the Port Phillip Association, and built a house near the corner of Flinders and Elizabeth streets, Melbourne. In May he acted as one of three arbitrators in connexion with disputes between Henry Batman and John Pascoe Fawkner, and before his house was completed he was in the habit of holding a service on Sunday in his tent. Thomson was secretary to the first public meeting held in Melbourne, on 1 June; in October William Lonsdale appointed him medical officer at a salary of ¬£200 a year. He resigned this position in January 1837. Geelong Having selected land on the present site of Geelong, Thomson settled there. He did some exploring, acquired more land in several localities, and in 1846 held about 150,000 acres (600 km¬≤). He was a director of the Port Phillip bank, which was a failure, and the Port Phillip Steam Navigation Company, and he was the first to make cash advances on wool. He was foremost in every movement connected with Geelong from the removal of the bar at the mouth of the harbour to the founding of a mechanics' institute. He also took much interest in church affairs and in the well-being of the aborigines. In these matters he gave not only time, he also spent considerable sums of money. The town was incorporated in 1849, then having 8000 inhabitants, and, as was fitting, Thomson was elected its first mayor. He field this position again in 1851, 1855, 1856 and 1857. He had been elected a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council as one of the representatives of the Electoral district of Port Phillip in 1843, but as it was difficult to attend the meetings at Sydney, soon resigned. He was active in the anti-transportation movement, in 1852 was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Council for Geelong, and brought in and passed a bill incorporating the \\"Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company\\". Thomson presided at the first meeting of shareholders and was one of the directors. The line was completed in 1857. In the meanwhile Thomson had resigned his seat in the council, and visited England where he found he could get no information about the Australian colonies bills. There had been a change of ministers and Lord John Russell, now in charge of the colonial office, had gone to Vienna. Thomson followed him there, obtained an interview, and got a promise that there would be a separate constitution bill for the colony of Victoria. In May 1855 Lord John Russell sent him a copy of the bill which soon afterwards became law. In 1857 Thomson was elected member for Geelong in the Victorian Legislative Assembly but resigned in April 1859. Thomson was elected member for Geelong East in October 1859, holding this seat until July 1861. His many activities had led to the neglect of his own financial affairs, and towards the end of his life he accepted the position of medical officer to the Sunbury boys' home. He died at Geelong on 1 January 1866 and was buried in the old Geelong cemetery. His wife and a daughter survived him. The suburb of Thomson was named after Dr. Thomson as well as Thomson Street Belmont, the nucleus of the Belmont Heights Estate which was until the first World War, part of his extensive rural property. A parish of the Uniting Church in Australia and the Alexander Thomson Cricket Club, competing in the Geelong Cricket Association, was also named after him.

The series was originally broadcast on BBC Three and later rerun on BBC Two. Reeves has said that the BBC do not want another series of Catterick, though he may produce a spin-off centring on the DI Fowler character. The series is named after Catterick in North Yorkshire, a village which gives it name to the nearby Catterick Garrison, Britain's largest army base. It is about 10 miles away from Darlington where Vic Reeves grew up. It is also about 20 miles away from Middlesbrough where Bob Mortimer grew up. Character histories Carl Palmer: Played by Bob, Carl is an ex-soldier and has returned home from service in Cyprus. He left because his ex-wife Judy was, according to his brother Chris, \\"having sly love with a midnight creeper.\\" He never makes it clear what went on in Cyprus. He wants to become reacquainted with his long-lost son, Paul, whom he abandoned when he was just four years old. He becomes attracted to Tess, the receptionist at the Mermade Hotel, when he and Chris go there to stay for a few days. In a similar way to Chris Palmer and DI Fowler (see below), Carl may be the same character as the Carl who is Head of Security for The Club in the sketches from Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer, though his appearance and mannerisms are not precisely the same (as with Chris and Keith Fowler). However, there is no indication that the Chris and Carl in The Club are brothers. Chris Palmer: Played by Vic, Chris is Carl's younger brother, and has a big woolly beard. He lives alone in their late mum's house, with only a turkey in a box for company. He had a George Clooney poster, but he ripped it in half, much to Carl's disgust. Chris does not get out much and has a habit of staring at people for no apparent reason. He has a one-man show called \\"Dreams of Parsimony\\" which involves him playing flute while climbing onto a chair. He also has a boomerang hidden somewhere, which he is desperate to find. His biggest ambition is to own \\"luxury pets\\" such as \\"a soft white poodle, a lobster, a venison and a silkworm.\\" He has always wanted to stay at the Mermade (sic) Hotel, which is why he and Carl end up stealing Tony's car. Just as DI Fowler below, Chris Palmer is ostensibly exactly the same as a character of the same name in The Club. Roy Oates: Played by Matt Lucas, Roy Oates is the manager of the Mermade Hotel. He is a very bad-tempered man with a strange, indeterminate accent and a pony tail. He has a habit of wearing ridiculous pink boots and constantly puts his feet up on tables and chairs to appear imposing. He is blackmailing the hotel's dogsbody, Mark, with incriminating photos. He has a girlfriend, Tess, who does not really like him very much. He holds one great secret. His penis was chopped off in an incident with the hotel till, and he keeps it in a jar. He hopes to raise enough money to go to Switzerland to have an operation, but the penis gets stolen along with the contents of his safe. Later, he also gets his hand chopped off by a curved blade. Tony: Played by Reece Shearsmith, Tony is a dangerous, psychotic armed robber who robs \\"Neil's Wheels\\" used car dealership and shoots the owner, Mr Neil Wheel. He is obsessed with keeping his mouth clean, drinking mouthwash and flossing his teeth. His Range Rover car, which contains a briefcase full of the stolen money, is eventually stolen by Chris and Carl, which provokes Tony to try to track them down and kill them. However, he is dominated by his mother, and he has to placate her before he can go on the rampage. By the end of the series, it turns out that Tony is in fact Carl's long-lost son, Paul Anthony, at which point he is supposed to be dead. Tess: Played by Morwenna Banks, is the long-suffering receptionist at the Mermade Hotel. She is also Roy Oates' reluctant girlfriend. She claims that before he had his \\"accident\\" he was great fun (\\"he even introduced me to a barrister,\\"). She is drawn to Carl, but is not willing to commit. She is addicted to the \\"gas\\" from an asthma inhaler, which induces an extremely brief spell of euphoria. She never believes anything anyone says, usually offering a reply along the lines of \\"You're tickling my turnips\\" or \\"You're feeling my fanny.\\" Mark: Played by Mark Benton, Mark is the Mermade Hotel's dogsbody. He is an amiable, mulleted and innocent sort of person. However, his time at the Mermade is miserable. He is a slave to Mr Oates, the hotel manager. After Mark caused an enormous accident at the annual flotilla the previous year, by bathing semi-clad on the rocks and being mistaken for a \\"sensual woman.\\" Oates captured him on camera and threatens to send the pictures to the press if Mark steps out of line. Mark also runs the Mermade Hotel's jazz-fusion disco night. He eventually helps Chris and Carl escape from the clutches of Tony and leaves the hotel. DI Keith Fowler: The intrepid \\"American Eagle,\\" played by Vic, DI Fowler is the determined police inspector who is finally living his dream of working for the NYPD (North Yorkshire Police Department). Certain things confuse him, however, such as the not-inconsiderable difference between a Volkswagen Golf and a Range Rover. He also mispronounces words such as \\"Tupperware\\" and \\"Lager\\" much to the confusion of everyone around. He believes the killer of Neil Wheel to be \\"a loose cannon... a tithead.\\" Along with his permanently baffled partner Webster (Matt Lucas) he enjoys a night on ecstasy in order to become a \\"oneness\\" with the suspect. He gets shot by Tony but survives and regales the nurses in his hospital of how he \\"blew the lid off Tony Falucci's hydraulics scam!\\" DI Fowler is fundamentally the same character as Kinky John from The Club sketches from Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer - although his profession and name differ, the look (including thick-lensed glasses), the voice and accent, and the demeanour are the same. Dan, Dan The Shellfish Man: Played by Lucas, Dan is a very enthusiastic Cockney shellfish retailer, who specialises in cockles, whelks, winkles and crabsticks. He is, according to Chris, \\"a nosy git\\" and helps Carl out in his search for his son. Dan is the only man who knows where Chris' boomerang is. Ian: Played by Tim Healy, Ian is one of the regulars in the Siberian Khatru pub in Northallerton. He is very talkative and likes sharing his bizarre stories with anyone within earshot. He very nearly joined a black rock-funk band, \\"sort of like Osibisa\\" but decided to stay home and look after his wife, who is freezing cold to the touch and has to be constantly kept warm with electric heaters. Ian finally comes to the realization that his wife has been dead for quite some time, but believes that it could have been the journey to the hospital that truly finished her off. Pat The Barman: Played by Charlie Higson, Pat is the grumpy barman of the Siberian Khatru. He is constantly trying to serve his own brand of van-flattened Spatchcock. =Minor characters= Sergeant Minge- Munchington: (Steve Furst) one of DI Fowler's hapless officers. Tony's Mum: Tony's mum (Julie T. Wallace) is very concerned about her son's behaviour, but is more than willing to give him what for if he steps out of line. Derek (Fanny Fresh Man): Played by Bob, this scraggly haired vagrant is run over by a cross-eyed woman and is strangely attracted to her \\"Fanny Fresh,\\" which is \\"prat spray.\\" He is also addicted to \\"gas\\" from asthma inhalers. He also seems to have commandeered the local \\"Pick Your Own\\" fruit reserve. He is not an American actor. He also spontaneously bursts in on Tess' forest cabin, on his endless quest for \\"Fanny Fresh!\\". Derek seems to be another refugee from Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer, originally appearing as Tom Fun's dolorous side-kick in the 'Fun Fun Fun' sketches. In Catterick, his appearance is identical to the earlier incarnation, but his voice and general behaviour are altogether more manic. Glen: (Frank Jarvis) Another one of the regulars at the Siberian Khatru, Glen never says a word, remains in his wheelchair, and always has a look of shock and awe on his face. He does get excited, however, at the prospect of crabsticks. Songs The varied soundtrack featured original music, with Jeff Beck on guitar, and was idiosyncratic in its use of popular music. As well as using songs to punctuate important moments in the plot, or to add surreality - such as the use of \\"Kinky Boots\\" by Patrick Macnee and Honor Blackman for many of Roy Oates' entrances - once an episode, characters would begin spontaneously lip-synching to songs. These were: *\\"Working On It\\" by Chris Rea (lip-synched by Mark) *\\"Satan Rejected My Soul\\" by Morrissey (Tony) *\\"The Sire Of Sorrow (Job's Sad Song)\\" by Joni Mitchell (Tess) *\\"Miss You\\" by Flanagan and Allen (DI Fowler) *\\"Hot On The Heels Of Heartbreak\\" by The Beautiful South (Tess and Carl) *\\"Only My Soul\\" by Free (Chris and Cast) The theme tune from Vic and Bob's short-lived BBC1 gameshow, Families at War, can be heard playing at Mark's disco featured in the second episode of the series.

It monitored, translated, and disseminated within the U.S. government openly available news and information from media sources outside the United States. Its headquarters was in Rosslyn, Virginia , later Reston, Virginia , and it maintained approximately 20 monitoring stations worldwide. In November 2005, it was announced that FBIS would become the newly formed Open Source Center, tasked with the collection and analysis of freely available intelligence. History On 26 February 1941, President Roosevelt directed that $150,000 be allocated for creation of the Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service (FBMS) under the authority of the Federal Communications Commission. The mandate of the FBMS was to record, translate, transcribe and analyze shortwave propaganda radio programs that were being beamed at the United States by the Axis powers. Its first monitoring station was established in October 1941 in Portland, Oregon. =Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service= The year following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the system gained importance and changed its name to The Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service. At four different listening centers it recorded short- wave broadcasts on plastic disks. Selected material was transcribed and translated and then sent to War agencies with weekly reports. These special reports included special titles such as Radio Tokyo's Racial Propaganda to the United States, Underground Movements and Morale in Japan, and New Nazi Portrait of the American Soldier. Monitored stations included official stations in many countries, and \\"black\\" stations that weren't what they pretended be. These black stations broadcast attacks on President Franklin D. Roosevelt while pretending to be stations in the American Midwest. This tactic was used to stir up race tensions and other issues. Multiple speeches and recording were monitored including speeches by Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Benito Mussolini, Philippe P√©tain, Pierre Laval, and others; broadcasts over German radio by American citizens, including Fred W. Kaltenbach, Douglas Chandler, and Edward Leo Delaney; and broadcasts from Japan or Japanese-held territory, including news reports and commentary by \\"Tokyo Rose.\\" The FBIS kept track of a total of sixty \\"black\\" stations, which included a German-language station that pretended to represent an anti-Nazi army group, an anti-Nazi \\"Catholic\\" station, and an English-language station that attacked Winston Churchill. =FBIS= With the end of World War II, the service was transferred to the Department of the Army. Like many other wartime organizations, the service was threatened with disbandment. The possibility of its disbandment was roundly criticized in many different quarters, which helped ensure its survival. Upon the passing of the National Security Act of 1947, the service was renamed the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) as a part of the CIA. Its original mission revolved around radio and press agency monitoring. In response to the Cuban Missile Crisis and START Treaty, FBIS was tasked with monitoring for clandestine and encoded messages from all nations and coordinating broadcast media contact points who could instantly broadcast urgent messages on \\"All Channels\\" and \\"All Calls\\". In 1967, the Service's mission was expanded to cover foreign mass media transmitted by radio, television, and print. In 2007, Readex announced its plans to create a digital edition entitled Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) Daily Reports, 1941‚Äì1996. As of March 2017, this collection is available online via a paid subscription to Readex, as are Daily Report Annexes for 1974-1996. Services FBIS had approximately 20 stations, commonly called bureaus, that were located around the world. These stations operated as an adjunct of a U.S. embassy/consulate or military command. Bureaus opened and closed at various times depending on the world situation and local circumstances. These stations were not covert and operated with the consent of the host government. In addition, a few of the bureaus were located on territory belonging to or administered by the US such as Key West, Florida, Bahia Sucia, Puerto Rico,url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/Security-CIA- II/CIA%20II%20113.pdf the Panama Canal Zone, etc. The personnel in the stations were both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals who were responsible for the collection, translation, and dissemination of foreign open source material. Depending on location, and the availability of print media, these personnel may have been responsible for translation of more than one language. Because of the large number print/radio/TV/satellite sources worldwide FBIS did not collect all open source material, but only those sources that met the requirements of the Intelligence Community. Besides the translations done overseas a large volume of less-time sensitive material was sent to FBIS headquarters in Rosslyn and Reston where a more detailed translation could take place. Not only were translations provided by in-house FBIS personnel, but approximately 700 independent contractors were also employed. Customers Material provided by FBIS was disseminated to over 700 recipients in not only in the U.S. Intelligence Community, but also a large number of government, diplomatic and military organizations. The material provided by FBIS, although it comes from openly available, public radio and TV broadcasts, is not made freely available to the American people, frequently due to copyright laws.

The library is located in the Neue Burg Wing of the Hofburg in center of Vienna. Since 2005, some of the collections have been relocated within the Baroque structure of the Palais Mollard-Clary. Founded by the Habsburgs, the library was originally called the Imperial Court Library (); the change to the current name occurred in 1920, following the end of the Habsburg Monarchy and the proclamation of the Austrian Republic.\\"NB online ‚Äì The National Library ‚Äì History\\" (overview), √ñsterreichische Nationalbibliothek, 2006, ONB.ac.at webpage: ONB-Lib-History . The library complex includes four museums, as well as multiple special collections and archives.  Middle Ages  Court Library (Hofbibliothek) entrance at Josefsplatz The institution has its origin in the imperial library of the Middle Ages. During the Medieval period, the Austrian Duke Albert III (1349‚Äì1395) moved the books of the Viennese vaults into a library. Albert also arranged for important works from Latin to be translated into German. In the Hofburg, the treasure of Archduke Albert III had been kept in sacristies inside the south tower of the imperial chapel. The Archduke was a connoisseur of art; he supported the University of Vienna, and he founded a royal workshop for illustrating manuscripts. The oldest book on record at the library, the 1368 golden Holy Gospels, was owned by Albert III; in 1368, Johannes of Troppau, priest at Landskron and canon in Brno, transcribed the four Gospels of the Bible in gold letters with detailed illustrations in the school of Burgundian book art. On scenes depicting the lives of the four Evangelists, four coats of arms show the House of Austria, Tirol, Styria, and Carinthia, the lands which Archduke Albrecht III had ruled at the time. Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor (1415‚Äì1493), had the goal of consolidating the art treasures among the Habsburg possessions. Among other things, he brought some valuable books into the Vienna, among them the Prager Wenzelsbibel and the document of the golden bull. Through his marriage with Mary of Burgundy, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor (1459‚Äì1519) came into possession of important books from Burgundy and north France, and brought these to Wiener Neustadt. With a value at that time estimated at 100,000 guldens, these books represented about an eighth of Mary's dowry. Also Maximilian's second wife, Bianca Maria Sforza, brought into the marriage books from Italian workshops as part of her dowry. At that time the books of the library were kept partially in Wiener Neustadt, partially in Vienna, and partially in Innsbruck. After the death of Maximilian, the books were sent to the palace at Innsbruck. In addition to the valuable books from the public treasury, the Bibliotheca Regia, which collected and categorized scientific works, was developed in Vienna during the 16th century. Besides books, that library also contained globes and atlases. Over time the library expanded thanks to donations from the personal libraries of individual scholars. The first head librarian, Hugo Blotius, was appointed in 1575 by Emperor Maximilian II. His most important task was drawing up the inventory of the library, which had grown to approximately 9,000 books. As a consequence, new works were added systematically, and other libraries were incorporated. On 26 August 1624, delivery of copies was regulated by order of Ferdinand II. The Imperial Library also increased by purchases. In particular, the library of Philipp Eduard Fugger led to a major expansion. The library currently has about 17,000 sheets of one of the first periodic printing elements, the Fugger newspapers, from the Fugger library.  Baroque  In 1722, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor authorised the construction of a permanent home for the library in the Hofburg palace, after the plans of Leopold I. The wing was begun by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and started accommodating the library in the 18th century. The most valuable addition at that time was the extensive collection of Prince Eugene of Savoy, whose 15,000 volumes included valuable books from France and Italy. The State Hall of the library housed about 200,000 books at this point. During the reorganization there was for the first time criticism regarding the fact that the library served mainly as representation rather than the search for knowledge. Doctor Gerard van Swieten, physician to Maria Theresia, and his son Gottfried van Swieten supplemented the collection with numerous scientific works. Gottfried van Swieten also successfully introduced the card index. This facilitated the continuous updating of the inventory.  Austrian Empire  After the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by Napoleon and the Austrian Empire proclaimed in its place, the library was again reorganized. Under custodian Paul Strattmann, the library received a program for the first time which described its order; the library gained a three-way viewpoint: * it was the library for the formed Classe of the capital who required instruction, * it was the national library of the Austrian Kaiserthum (empire), where visitors expected to find literary rarities, and, * it was the library of the Hofburg, from which it takes its name. The collection politics of the Imperial Library separated at the beginning the 19th century appreciably due to the requirements of the representation and its attention to scientific works. The multinational condition of the Austrian Empire brought with itself that, not only German-language books were collected, but also books of the Slavic and Hungarian linguistic area. Substantial parts of the Hungarian collection moved to Budapest, however, after reconciliation with Hungary. During the March revolution of 1848, the Imperial Library was in extreme danger, when after the bombardment of Vienna caused the burning of the Hofburg, in which the Imperial Library was located. An important addition to the Imperial Library is the papyrus collection, which goes back to the acquisitions of the Viennese of antique dealer Theodor Graf.  First Republic and German Reich  After the proclamation of the Republic of Austria, the Imperial Library was renamed in 1920 as the Austrian National Library. The collection politics of intermediate wartime concentrated on \\"the national literature of those German trunks, which came now under foreign-national rule.\\" The director at that time of the library was Josef Donabaum. Under the line of the general manager, Paul Heigl, during the Nazi period (NS-zeit), hundreds of thousands of writings were accommodated here or the library served for majority the worthless, but seized works as transit camps into German libraries. \\"The historical heritage of the Austrian National Library is not free of injustice and guilt. That is true in a particular manner of the period of National Socialism. Led by a fanatical National Socialist, Paul Heigl, the National Library was an active participant on a grand scale in the systematic robbing in the first place of Jewish citizens, but also of other victims of the Nazi regime. Despite considerable restitutions in the post-war years major portions of the looted collections remained in the Library. So the earliest possible restitution of those holdings to their legitimate possessors is for the Austrian National Library not only a duty under law, but also a moral question. With the Federal Law on Restitution of Art Objects in 1998,Kunstr√ºckgabegesetz, BGBl. I, 181/1998 the basis, long since necessary, was created. In December 2003, after careful examination of all relevant holdings, the Austrian National Library completed its report on provenance according to the Law on Restitution of Art Objects of 1998, and handed it over to the Commission for Provenance. The essential findings are lists of illegal acquisitions during the Nazi period which are still in the possession of the Austrian National Library. Since then the Austrian National Library has taken pains to find the legitimate owners or inheritors, so as to give back the objects as quickly as possible. Since December of 2003 a total of 32,937 objects have been restored to their lawful owners.\\"Werner, Margot. 2003. \\"Provenance Research and Restitution.\\" Bericht der √ñsterreichischen Nationalbibliothek an die Kommission f√ºr Provenienzforschung (Provenienzbericht). Wien: √ñsterreichischen Nationalbibliothek. See: accessed April 19, 2012.  Post-World War II  Renamed again into the Austrian National Library after 1945, small parts were returned again, but the majority remained in the collections. The attention of the collection activity was directed again in small steps toward Central and Eastern Europe. In 1966, large parts of the collections were moved from the building at Josefsplatz to the premises of the Neue Burg wing at Heldenplatz, where new reading halls were set up. Due to the rising space requirement in 1992, the library opened up to approximately 4 million works. Wider ranges for reading halls were furnished at the same time, so that three levels are currently at the disposal of visitors (two floors of the main reading hall and the magazine reading hall). For an extensive amount of time, the library used a card-catalog index. Since 1995, an electronic system has been in place, which went online in 1998. As of 2001, books confiscated from Jewish Austrians during World War II have been slowly returned to the heirs. It is estimated that nearly 25,000 works fall into this category.  Legal status today  On 1 January 2002 the library gained the full legal capacity to dismiss staff. This brought the full control to the mechanism in budget and personnel questions. The library has a certain part of its budget funded by the state; additional funds must be raised by sponsorships, reproduction services, and the loaning from the premises. Organizationally, the library uses a central management and has three chief departments (personnel and accounting, inventory structure and treatment, as well as use and information), plus the individual collections. The head of the library reports to a board of trustees on a quarterly basis.  Prunksaal  View of the imperial library at Josephsplatz (1835) The Prunksaal, center of the old imperial library The Prunksaal () is the central structure of the old imperial library and part of the Hofburg palace. The wing is located in-between Josephsplatz to the north and the Burggarten to the south. The books in the monastery of the Conventual Franciscans (Minoritenkloster) were stored here. The wing was begun in 1721 by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and finished after his death in 1723 by his son Joseph Emanuel. The sculptures on the wing are by Lorenzo Mattielli. The hall is divided, after the original list of the books, into two opposite \\"war\\" and \\"peace\\" sides, which is reflected also in the wall frescoes, from Daniel Gran. The fresco in the central dome represents a kind Apotheosis of Emperor Charles VI, whose image is held by Hercules and Apollo. Around the image of the emperor, several types of allegorical figures meet in a complicated theme, which symbolize the virtues of the Habsburgs and the wealth of their domains. Located in the hall are marble statues of emperors with the statue of emperor Charles VI in its centre, created by the sculptors Peter Strudel and Paul Strudel. The four large globes are by Vincenzo Coronelli. During the reign of empress Maria Theresia, cracks started appearing in the dome, in which Court architect Nikolaus Pacassi soon strengthened the dome with an iron ring. The memorial fresco of Gran (in which the trace of a tear can be seen) was restored by Franz Anton Maulbertsch. Also during her reign, the wing was extended on both ends, connecting the central Prunksaal with the Hofburg and St. Augustine's Church, forming Josefsplatz (Joseph Square).  Collections  One of the major tasks of the Austrian National Library is the collection and archiving of all publications appearing in Austria (including electronic media). Depending on the law for the medium, four copies, and by other printing elements, two obligation copies each, must be delivered to the National Library by periodic printing elements appearing in Austria. In addition, the library collects all works of Austrian authors appearing abroad, as well as such works which concern Austrians or the Austrian spirit and culture. Further publications from the foreign country are taken up with emphasis on the range of the Geisteswissenschaften. Tasks and services of the national library cover the development of the existence and their supply in the form of local-loan, remote-loan, and search services as well as Auskunfts, information and reproduction services. The legally given general order for education is obeyed also by co-operation with universities, schools and adult education mechanisms. Altogether, the library has more than seven million objects, of which approximately three million are printed. =Manuscripts and rare books= Page (fol. 6 verso) from the Vienna Dioscurides, depicting princess Juliana Anikia and allegories of Generosity and Intelligence Globe collection, housed in the Palais Mollard-Clary Dating from the 4th century CE to the present, this collection includes antique, medieval and modern manuscripts from almost every literate culture. Notable items in the collection include the Vienna Dioscurides, which was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 1997 in recognition of its world significance and outstanding universal value.Vienna Dioscurides = Map collection and Globe Museum = The map collection includes maps back to the 16th century and it has existed since 1905. After the First World War, the collection of the Habsburgs was taken over, designated as the Habsburg \\"Family Estate Library\\" (Familien-Fideikommiss-Bibliothek). The map collection includes the Globe Museum, containing over 380 globes, some dating back to the 16th century. It is the world's only public globe museum, and has been in existence since 1956. The principal part of the Globe Museum's inventory consists of globes which existed before 1850. There is also technical literature in the collection, plus similar instruments, such as armillary spheres. The map collection also includes the 17th century Atlas Blaeu-Van der Hem, a 50-volume set that consists of more than 2,400 maps, prints, and drawings. Considered the most beautiful and most remarkable atlas ever composed, it includes four volumes of manuscript maps and topographical drawings originally made for the Dutch East India Company (VOC). It was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 2003.The Atlas Blaeu-Van der Hem of the Austrian National Library Memory of the World = Papyrus collection and Papyrus Museum = During the 19th century, the papyrus collection became an important part of the library. The collection goes back to a private collection of Austrian Archduke Rainer, who gave the collection to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria on 18 August 1899. The Papyrus collection contains about 180,000 objects from the period between that of the 15th Century BCE and the 16th Century CE. Besides papyri the collection includes papers, records on clay tablets, inscribed wood and wax trays, stone tablets, leathers, textiles and bones, as well as gold, silver and bronze articles with inscriptions. The Papyrus collection (Collection Archduke Rainer) is the largest such collection worldwide, and was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 2001. The Papyrus Museum, located in the library in the Neue Burg wing of the Hofburg Palace, has around 200 objects from the collection on display. =Music= Since 1826, the music collection contains numerous scores and first-printings of works of well-known composers, such as Anton Bruckner or Richard Strauss. Numerous recordings such as records or CDs are kept as well. Among the music collection are also many handwritten notes of composers. = Incunabula, old and precious prints = Containing old and valuable printings, the collection of Incunabula is one of the five largest collections of historical block printing of the world. As an independent collection, it has existed since 1995 and ranks thereby among the youngest of the library. The collection covers approximately 8,000 incunabula (the fourth largest in existence worldwide), block printings from 1501 to 1850 (e.g. the Fugger newspapers), and bibliophile as well as rare and valuable printings without temporal restriction. The SIAWD collection has also been supplemented with Chinese and Japanese printings. =Planned languages and Esperanto Museum= The Department of Planned Languages and Esperanto Museum incorporates a collection of materials related to planned languages. =Women's and gender studies= The Department of the Library which collects, digitizes and works to promote publications on women and gender studies is known as Ariadne. Founded in 1992, the department digitized its materials in 2000 and works to improve the visibility of women's contributions to society and in the history of Austria.

It was carried by the ABC network and aired each weekday afternoon. Created by Dick Clark as a spin-off of American Bandstand, Where the Action Is premiered on June 27, 1965. The show was another step in the then-current trend of entertainment programs that targeted the teenage audience by focusing on pop music, following in the footsteps of Shindig! (premiered in the fall of 1964, also on ABC) and Hullabaloo (premiered January 1965 on NBC). Dick Clark's voice could be heard doing the artist introductions, and he sometimes did filmed interviews. The show was hosted by Linda Scott and Steve Alaimo, who sang numbers between guest performances. Ms. Scott had a few hit singles as a teenager in the early 1960s; she was only 20 when \\"Action\\" premiered. Also appearing were Keith Allison (a Paul McCartney look-alike who later became a member of Paul Revere and the Raiders) and Laura Nyro. Typically, the show featured two or three performers lip-synching their recent hits with a bunch of teenagers clapping and swaying in the background, and a dance segment featuring the Action dancers. There would occasionally be an interview segment. A few episodes featured only one performer, such as Herman's Hermits or James Brown. Originally intended as a summer replacement and broadcast at 2 P.M. EDT, the show was successful enough for it to continue throughout the 1965‚Äì66 TV season, with a change in time period to 4:30 P.M. Eastern time following the horror soap opera Dark Shadows. Both programs attracted a young audience who watched the shows after school. It was in black and white. The show's theme song, \\"Action\\", became a hit single for Freddy \\"Boom Boom\\" Cannon, peaking on the charts (#13) in September 1965. Most of these black-and-white telecasts were taped at various locales in Southern California. A handful of segments were taped elsewhere around The United States. The theme song was written by Steve Venet and Tommy Boyce. Later, Boyce co-wrote songs for The Monkees. The program had its own stable of performers, most notably Paul Revere & the Raiders, who served as the de facto house band. Easily identified by their Revolutionary War costumes, the band had several Top 40 hits in the '60s thanks in part to the exposure they received on \\"Where The Action Is\\". Their lead singer, Mark Lindsay, with his signature ponytail, became one of the most popular teenage idols of the decade, gracing the covers of countless teen magazines. The Raiders also recorded the \\"Action\\" theme song for their 1965 album \\"Just Like Us\\" for which Dick Clark wrote the liner notes. When the group departed the show in 1966, they were replaced by The Robbs and The Hard Times. Other regular performers on Action included the dance troupe Pete Menefee and the Action Kids. Individual episodes featured a wide range of guest performers, as detailed below. Tina Mason was a regular singer being promoted by Dick Clark on the show. She met and later married Phil Volk, the bass player for Paul Revere and the Raiders, whom she met on the \\"Action\\" set. They married on the second anniversary of the show's premiere, June 27, 1967. The weekday program was cancelled on March 31, 1967, with the network giving its local affiliates the time slot. However, members of the program's mainstay band Paul Revere and the Raiders (with lead vocalist Mark Lindsay) hosted very similar follow-up shows; both Revere and Lindsay hosted Happening '68, a Saturday afternoon follow-up to American Bandstand, and a weekday version of the same show, It's Happening, from 1968 to 1969. Both shows were produced by Dick Clark's production company for ABC. Regulars *Dick Clark (Host- Announcer.

Bally is currently under the leadership of CEO Nicolas Girotto (May 2019), with parent company JAB Holdings at the helm. History Share of the C. F. Bally AG, issued 3. October 1907 Bally was founded in 1851 by Carl Franz Bally in Sch√∂nenwerd, Switzerland. Originally a family-run ribbon manufacturer, Carl Franz established a shoemaking business after visiting Paris, where he was inspired when buying novel shoe styles for his wife. Subsequently, the Bally & Co. shoe company was launched from his home, and by 1916, the company had 7,000 employees and was producing four million pairs of shoes annually with boutiques in Paris, London, Geneva and Buenos Aires. Carl Franz died in 1899, but undeniably passed on his pioneering spirit to his sons. One hundred years later, in 1951, his grandson Max Bally went on to design one of the brand‚Äôs most iconic shoes, the men‚Äôs Bally Scribe, which was named in homage to the famous Hotel Scribe in Paris. In 1948, Bally produced the innovative curling footwear for the Swiss national team at the Winter Olympic Games in St. Moritz. Bally‚Äôs early sponsorship of 20th century Swiss expeditions also led to the creation of the Reindeer-Himalaya boots, worn by Tenzing Norgay during the first-ever successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953 with Sir Edmund Hillary. In the 1980s, Bally was also one of the first European luxury goods brands to open in post-reform and opening China. By now the brand had also extended its offering to include clothing, handbags and leather goods for both men and women (1976), and in 1990 would open stores in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Lebanon and Turkey. In Spring 2020, Bally reimagined its Kuba sneakers, inspired by a heritage of sporting excellence and named after the Swiss tennis legend Jakob Hlasek, who famously wore the shoes in the 1990‚Äôs during the ATP Tour in 1991 and his Grand Slam doubles‚Äô victory in 1992 at the French Open with partner Marc Rosset. In 2008 TPG Capital sold Bally International AG to Vienna, Austria- based Labelux Group, a luxury goods holding firm which also owns Jimmy Choo Ltd. and was founded by the German billionaire Reimann family as part of the family‚Äôs investment arm JAB Holding Company.Labelux Group acquires Bally International AG from Texas Pacific Group Inc - Thomson Financial Mergers & Acquisitions - AlacraStore.com Headquartered in Caslano, Ticino, Switzerland, the company announced that Fr√©d√©ric de Narp, a former executive at Harry Winston, would become its chief executive officer in November 2013. In February 2018 owner JAB Holding Company agreed to sell a majority controlling stake to Chinese materials conglomerate Shandong Ruyi.https://www.drapersonline.com/news/shandong-ruyi-snaps-up- bally/7029005.article In May 2019, Bally appointed COO Nicolas Girotto, who joined the company in October 2015 and sits on the brand's board of directors and executive committee, as CEO. As of March 2020, Shandong Ruyi had yet to secure its $600 million acquisition of Bally. Sustainability With Alpine origins, Bally‚Äôs ties to the mountains date back to 1851. In the company‚Äôs early years, founder Carl Franz established a welfare system for employees that included onsite facilities like a canteen, children‚Äôs daycare and a community park. Bally.com ‚Äì Our Commitment The company published a broader Sustainability Roadmap in 2019, based transparency, quality, collaboration and progress. The company indicated an intent to target quantifiable goals across the business from production to logistics, labor protection to packaging, and has banned precious skins and fur from the brand‚Äôs production. The brand simultaneously confirmed a two-year partnership with the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation in Bern, Switzerland, to extend their environmental efforts and to sponsor the organization‚Äôs annual Mountain Protection Award. Bally also signed the Fashion Pact in October 2019, joining a global coalition of brands championing a more sustainable fashion industry by addressing the climate, biodiversity and oceans. Bally launched its Bally Peak Outlook initiative in Spring 2019, which included an inaugural clean-up of Mount Everest from base camp to the peak. Led by Nepalese adventurer and environmentalist Dawa Steven Sherpa, two tons of waste were successfully removed from the mountain, over half of which was collected from the death zone. The brand also works with Tenzing Norgay‚Äôs son, Jamling Tenzing Norgay, who advises on Bally Peak Outlook initiatives and helps to build awareness for mountain preservation. In July 2020, Bally established the Bally Peak Outlook Foundation, which aims to safeguard the world‚Äôs fragile mountain environments, and pledged to clean up the base camps of eight 8,000-meter Himalayan mountains over the course of two years, with a high-altitude cleanup of Japan‚Äôs Mount Fuji, and to build new sustainable trails to access the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Boutiques According to Bilanz, as of January 2020, Bally's retail network includes 311 boutiques, with 500 multi- brand points of sale spanning 66 countries.  Bally Haus  In September 2019, Bally opened ‚ÄúBally Haus,‚Äù its debut flagship concept located on the corner of Via Montenapoleone and Via Manzoni in Milan‚Äôs Quadrilatero della moda. Designed by Casper Mueller Kneer Architects, the three-level building spans 6,048 square feet, and reveres the brand‚Äôs Swiss heritage while emphasizing natural elements, like travertine and clay, and local influences, like an artisan-laid Milanese courtyard at the boutique‚Äôs entrance. In July 2020, the Bally Haus design concept was rolled out to Bally boutiques in China at Shanghai Yaohan and Hangzhou Tower, and will extend to more storefronts in Hangzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, Changzhou and Shijiazhuang by the end of year.

It is the continuation of a successful 1970s glam rock outfit, Catapult; its members also formed a successful production and songwriting team, Cat Music, responsible for a number of Dutch hit songs. History The band was formed by various ex-members of a rock combo called Catapult, which split up in the early 1980s. Catapult had scored a number of hits in the late 1970s playing a form of glam rock; \\"Let your hair hang down\\" and \\"Teeny Bopper Band\\" were two of the band's hits. After their popularity faded, the band split up and its members formed a production company, Cat Music, specializing in producing various bands (including hard rock act Picture) and occasional one-hit wonders. They became quite adept at songwriting; Andre Hazes recorded three of their songs for his album Gewoon Andr√©, including the number-one hit \\"Een Beetje Verliefd\\". The members did form a number of other bands, one of which, The Monotones, had a hit in Germany and the Netherlands with the song \\"Mono\\". Rubberen Robbie was their vehicle for parody and carnival songs. One of the band's most popular songs, \\"De Nederlandse Sterre Die Strale Overal\\" (\\"Dutch Stars Shine Everywhere\\"), was a medley of verses adapted and butchered from Dutch hit songs; the very idea of such a compilation parodied a slew of hits by the Dutch novelty pop act Stars on 45; it sold 60,000 copies in three weeks and earned the band number one status on the Dutch charts. The band is hailed as one of the best acts from Leiden; their song \\"3 Oktoberrr\\" is a perennial favorite at the Leids 3 October Festival (the triple r in the song title is a reference to the Leiden dialect, with its peculiar pronunciation of that phoneme). Almost thirty years later the song was still ranked 62 in the top 500 songs of Omroep West, the regional radio station. Other well-known songs by the band include a parody of the Dutch classic levenslied \\"Zuiderzeeballade\\", and the song \\"Marie\\" (about a guy complaining that his girlfriend left him, even though he didn't cheat on her more than once a week), which is cited as an example of what the Leiden dialect sounds like. The band remains popular as a live act. Since the mid-2000s, singer Cees Bergman plays live concerts with a classic rock band, Van Beukenstein. Maximum Overdrive is a cover band playing Rubberen Robbie songs.

C. Fields, featuring Joseph Calleia, Ruth Donnelly, Margaret Hamilton, Donald Meek, Willard Robertson, Dick Foran, William B. Davidson, and Addison Richards, and released by Universal Pictures. It was directed by Edward F. Cline and the music was written by Ben Oakland (song \\"Willie of the Valley\\") and Frank Skinner. West reportedly wrote the original screenplay, with Fields contributing one extended scene set in a bar. Universal decided to give the stars equal screenplay credit, perhaps to avoid the appearance of favoritism, but the move incensed West, who declined to team with Fields afterwards. The stars spoofed themselves and the Western genre, with West providing a series of her trademark double entendres. Plot In the American Old West of the 1880s, Miss Flower Belle Lee (Mae West), a singer from Chicago, is on her way to visit relatives. While she is traveling on a stagecoach with three men and a woman named Mrs. Gideon (Margaret Hamilton), the town gossip and busybody, a masked bandit on horseback holds up the stage for its shipment of gold and orders the passengers to step out. The masked bandit immediately takes an interest in the saucy blonde. As he makes his getaway with the gold, he takes her with him. Upon reaching the town of Little Bend, the others report the robbery and kidnapping to the sheriff (William B. Davidson). Flower Belle then walks into town, unharmed, and explains, \\"I was in a tight spot but I managed to wiggle out of it.\\" Later that evening, at the home of her Aunt Lou (Ruth Donnelly) and Uncle John (Willard Robertson), the masked bandit enters Flower Belle's second floor bedroom and they start kissing. However, his presence and departure is witnessed by Mrs. Gideon. She quickly reports what she has seen and Flower Belle is annoyed to find herself hauled up before the judge (Addison Richards). Offended by her indifferent manner, the judge asks angrily \\"Young lady, are you trying to show contempt for this court?\\" She answers: \\"No, I'm doing my best to hide it!\\" Flower Belle is then run out of Little Bend. She boards a train to Greasewood City. It makes an unscheduled stop to pick up con-man Cuthbert J. Twillie (W. C. Fields). When hostile Indians attack, Flower Belle saunters to a window and mows them down with two pistols, while Twillie dodges flying arrows and fights off the Indians with a child's slingshot. Flower Belle has little use for Twillie until she sees a stash of money in his bag. Believing him to be rich, she then plays up to him and they get acquainted. They have an impromptu wedding, officiated over by a passenger, Amos Budge (Donald Meek), a gambler who looks like a minister. As she has only pretended to marry Twillie for \\"respectability\\", Flower Belle gets a separate hotel room in Greasewood City. Meanwhile, Twillie is made sheriff by the saloon owner and town boss Jeff Badger (Joseph Calleia), who has an ulterior motive: he hopes the new sheriff, who is clearly incompetent, will be unable to interfere with Badger's crimes. Flower Belle attracts the attention of Badger, newspaper editor Wayne Carter (Dick Foran), and every other man in town. While keeping her troublesome \\"husband\\" out of reach and out of trouble, Flower Belle encounters the masked bandit again. At one point, she kisses Badger, and recognizes that Badger is the masked bandit, musing: \\"That man's kiss is like a signature.\\" Twillie attempts to consummate his \\"marriage\\" with Flower Belle, but she escapes and leaves a goat in their bed. Twillie, unaware of the substitution, attempts to make love to the goat, and is surprised when he discovers that it is not his wife. One night, Twillie again attempts to consummate his \\"marriage\\" by entering Flower Belle's room disguised as the masked bandit. He is caught, accused of being the masked bandit, and is about to be hanged. With the noose around his neck, he makes his last request to the lynching party. \\"I'd like to see Paris before I die. Philadelphia will do!\\" However, Flower Belle saves Twillie. Cast *Mae West as Flower Belle Lee *W. C. Fields as Cuthbert J.

West and Fields received joint screenplay credit, however, West later claimed that she wrote most of the film and that Fields only wrote some of the scenes, such as the bar scene, and some dialogue and was given joint credit as an inducement to \\"straighten himself up and finish the picture\\". The film was heavily censored, with many scenes and lines of dialogue ordered to be cut or altered. It opened just one month later and became Fields' highest-grossing film for Universal. Reportedly, West and Fields did not like each other, and would not speak to each other except during filming. Reviews were mixed, but Fields performance was praised across the board, while West's was criticized. She was so furious that she refused to work with Fields ever again or even to talk to him or about him.Turner Classic Movies entry for My Little Chickadee. Written by Jeremy Arnold. TCM.com Fields had starred in a series of comedies for Paramount in the 1930s. My Little Chickadee was West's first screen performance since Every Day's a Holiday (1937) for Paramount Pictures. This was Fields' second film for Universal, and West's only film for Universal. It was also the last successful film of West's career; her three subsequent films all failed at the box office. My Little Chickadee was the third of five films starring Fields and directed by Edward F. Cline, an ex-Keystone Cop. The others were Million Dollar Legs (1932), You Can't Cheat an Honest Man (1939), The Bank Dick (1940), and Never Give a Sucker an Even Break (1941). Reception Frank S. Nugent reviewed the film negatively for The New York Times, writing that \\"the film is at low tide most of the time in the quality of its humor, in the broad treatment its players and directors have given it, in the caliber of the audience it seems intended to please and in the generally bad odor it exudes.\\" Variety wrote that the film \\"has its sagging moments, and the slim basic story cannot be taken seriously at any point. But there's sufficient broad humor and elemental comedy to satisfy generally.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote that West and Fields \\"play up to each other very well and make a good team. Due to their efforts the picture offers good mass entertainment, in spite of the fact that the story is thin.\\" Film Daily wrote that it was \\"all lusty fun\\" with \\"some amusing gags and situations.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker called West \\"as fresh and ebullient as ever\\" after her two-year absence from the screen. My Little Chickadee was a box office success, earning $2 million in gross receipts.

He was France's most important pianist in the nineteenth century, apart from Chopin. Plant√© was born in Orthez. He studied piano under Antoine Marmontel, his career beginning at the age of seven in Paris. While there he met and befriended many like- minded musicians who would have a long-lasting effect on his career. These included Franz Liszt, with whom he played arrangements of two of Liszt's symphonic poems (Les Pr√©ludes, and Tasso, Lamento e Trionfo) for 2 pianos, Hector Berlioz, Gioachino Rossini, Charles Gounod, Felix Mendelssohn, Sigismond Thalberg and Charles-Marie Widor. It is also known that he himself heard Fr√©d√©ric Chopin play, and because of this, his recordings - and indeed the one film available of him - are seen as a link to a 'lost world' of piano performanceJean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, Neva Editions, 2015, p. 52 & 87\\\\. . He toured the concert platforms of Europe after leaving Paris, expanding his reputation for quality of tone and virtuosic, emotional interpretations. The death of his wife in 1908 resulted in him retiring from the stage, except for charity performances and concerts in aid of those wounded in the First World War. He had many pupils, including Alexander Brailowsky. He died in Saint-Avit. Plant√© is featured in the 1999 DVD The Art of Piano, in which a short excerpt from the film of him playing Chopin's √âtude in C, Op. 10 No. 7 can be seen. Francis Plant√©'s style is considered very different from modern-day recording artists. The recordings available suggest a more paced performance with a more prominent accent on each beat and with the notes more pronounced.

It was written by Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, two of The Goodies. Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, who wrote Porridge, were script editors. It was produced by Witzend for ATV, which became Central midway through the production run. Channel 4 repeated a selection of eight of the episodes in 1986. Plot The three primary characters are sent into outer space to occupy a space station for six months. They take with them a dog, a collection of white mice and some insects. The dog, Bimbo, had previously appeared in The Goodies. The astronauts' names are Malcolm Mattocks, Gentian Foster and David Ackroyd, whilst the astronauts' contact at Mission Control is Beadle, an American. The humour was primarily based on the claustrophobic conditions of the two-room \\"sky lab\\" and the consequent tensions. Cast * Christopher Godwin as Commander Malcolm Mattocks * Carmen du Sautoy as Dr. Gentian Foster * Barrie Rutter as Technical Officer David Ackroyd * Bruce Boa as Beadle Episodes =Series 1 (1981)= #Episode One (26 October 1981) ‚Äì It's the dawning of a new era. US Air Force Colonel Lloyd Beadle unveils his British space travellers for the press, whose imaginations go into overdrive when they learn that one of the crew is a woman. But Beadle has another ace up his sleeve: Bimbo, a mongrel dog. #Episode Two (2 November 1981) ‚Äì In their orbiting space station, the crew members are trying to acclimatise themselves while rapidly discovering each other's foibles. Sleep eludes them, and they realise that privacy is a thing of the past... #Episode Three (9 November 1981) ‚Äì Gentian's in charge of the Life Science Projects, and David's doing Earth Observation, Astronomy, Crystallography and Communications ‚Äî leaving Malcolm doing the dusting. And not terribly well. It takes a major crisis before the Mission Commander finally comes into his own. #Episode Four (16 November 1981) ‚Äì Earthly problems invade the space station and Gentian Foster believes she knows why: Ackroyd's being beastly because he doesn't fancy her, and Mattocks is being patronising because he does. #Episode Five (23 November 1981) ‚Äì After five weeks of constant surveillance, relations between the crew and Ground Control are strained. So when Beadle disappears for lunch, the astronauts decide to get even. #Episode Six (30 November 1981) ‚Äì Fifty days in space should be newsworthy, but the media has already lost interest. Beadle promises to remedy the situation. Ackroyd, however, is more interested in the potent product of his lab experiment involving yeast, fruit flies and a copious quantity of blackcurrant juice... #Episode Seven (7 December 1981) ‚Äì Nine weeks into the mission: depression is rampant. The food is boring. The routine is boring. Then, catastrophe! A wiring fault plunges the station into darkness. With Mattocks and Ackroyd out of action, Foster must rely on Bimbo to save her. =Series 2 (1983)= #\\"One in Four Goes\\" (19 July 1983) ‚Äì Gentian finds herself talking to the machinery while Ackroyd quite happily holds conversations with himself. Mattocks is concerned about both of them and discusses it with the only person he can trust ‚Äî Bimbo. #\\"Why Are We Here?\\" (26 July 1983) ‚Äì Ackroyd denounces the whole mission as a big publicity stunt. Mattocks, meanwhile, has been caught out acting furtively and sending scrambled messages. Gentian and Ackroyd want to know what's happening but it's top secret... #\\"Absence Makes the Heart\\" (2 August 1983) ‚Äì Mattocks is pining for his wife but he gets no sympathy from the other two, who are determined to see that he lives up to his domestic responsibilities while he's at the space station. Beadle has a hot date. #\\"We Are Not Alone\\" (9 August 1983) ‚Äì Ackroyd is concerned that he is now maintaining some of the systems beyond their level of tolerance ‚Äî emergency repairs are now the norm. During one of the blackouts Gentian sees a bright object outside her lab window. #\\"One Week to Go\\" (16 August 1983) ‚Äì One week to go and the crew breaks the record for the longest spaceflight in history. Beadle is ecstatic but Mattocks is behaving more strangely than normal, questioning things at a cosmic level ‚Äî much to the annoyance of the other two. #\\"Going Home\\" (23 August 1983) ‚Äì After six months, the mission is completed and it's time to go home. Mattocks' recent epiphany still annoys the other two, and concern over re-entry has caused group insomnia. Ackroyd doesn't want to go home. American version On 11 August 1982, CBS aired a pilot for an American adaptation called The Astronauts, but no series developed.

Each year, this facility hosts hundreds of researchers from universities, national laboratories, and industry, who conduct basic and applied research and technology development using neutrons. SNS is part of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is managed by UT-Battelle for the United States Department of Energy (DOE). SNS is a DOE Office of Science user facility,User Facilities  U.S. DOE Office of Science (SC) and it is open to scientists and researchers from all over the world. thumbleft350pxThe Spallation Neutron Source delivered its first neutrons in 2006. Since then, 15 one-of-a-kind scientific instruments have been completed for use by researchers from all over the world. The instrument suite will eventually include up to 25 instruments.  Neutron scattering research  Neutron scattering allows scientists to count scattered neutrons, measure their energies and the angles at which they scatter, and map their final positions. This information can reveal the molecular and magnetic structure and behavior of materials, such as high-temperature superconductors, polymers, metals, and biological samples. In addition to studies focused on fundamental physics, neutron scattering research has applications in structural biology and biotechnology, magnetism and superconductivity, chemical and engineering materials, nanotechnology, complex fluids, and others.  How SNS works  Three-dimensional rendering of the Spallation Neutron Source facility layout indicating the national laboratory responsible for each primary part of the facility. The areas in red are constructed underground. The spallation process at SNS begins with negatively charged hydrogen ions that are produced by an ion source. Each ion consists of a proton orbited by two electrons. The ions are injected into a linear particle accelerator, or linac, which accelerates them to an energy of about one GeV (or to about 90% the speed of light). The ions pass through a foil, which strips off each ion's two electrons, converting it to a proton. The protons pass into a ring-shaped structure, a proton accumulator ring, where they spin around at very high speeds and accumulate in \\"bunches.\\" Each bunch of protons is released from the ring as a pulse, at a rate of 60 times per second (60 hertz). The high-energy proton pulses strike a target of liquid mercury, where spallation occurs. The spalled neutrons are then slowed in a moderator and guided through beam lines to areas containing special instruments where they are used in a wide variety of experiments.  History  Most of the world's neutron sources were built decades ago, and although the uses and demand for neutrons have increased throughout the years, few new sources have been built. To fill that need for a new, improved neutron source, the DOE Office of Basic Energy Sciences funded the construction of SNS, which would provide the most intense pulsed neutron beams in the world for scientific research and industrial development. The construction of SNS was a partnership of six DOE national laboratories: Argonne, Brookhaven, Lawrence Berkeley, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Jefferson. This collaboration was one of the largest of its kind in U.S. scientific history and was used to bring together the best minds and experience from many different fields. After more than five years of construction and a cost of $1.4 billion, SNS was completed in April 2006. The first three instruments began commissioning and were available to the scientific community in August 2007. As of 2017, a total of 20 instruments have been completed, and SNS is hosting about 1,400 researchers per year.

In the early nineteenth century, David Ricardo suggested issuing token money as long as it did not affect commodity standard. =Physical tokens= Former tokens are collected and displayed Token money has less commodity value compared to its face value. If the token money is metallic it is commonly made out of cheaper metals such as copper and nickel. Token money is also money whose face value exceeds its cost of production, i.e. the intrinsic value is lower than the extrinsic value. This means that the actual worth of a note or coin is much less than what we use it for. The cost of production of token money is less than its actual value, for example with convertible currency, collector notes, souvenirs, coupons, some retired US banknotes and per 1986 banknotes printed in regulation size and only on one side with authorization are actually worth more dollars than when issued. With token money, exchanges are not considered fully complete because the exchange of value is not equivalent. Value is hoped to be rendered at some future time.

Adams resulting in two different stories with the same title. Plot summary (revised edition) Fenton Hardy, the famous private detective and father of the Hardy Boys, asks his sons to help him with his latest case involving a criminal named Felix Snattman and the illegal drug trade smuggling of stolen drugs. Hardy directs Frank and Joe to a house on the cliff, whose location overlooking Barmet Bay offers an excellent vantage point to watch for smugglers. The Hardys are tricked into the house by cries for help, and are trapped for a short time in the attic; meanwhile, their telescope and motorcycles are damaged, possibly by the smugglers. They observe a man boating on Barmet Bay being chased by another motorboat. After his boat explodes in flames, Biff and Joe swim out while Frank and Chet get a rowboat to rescue the man. Once brought to shore, the man regains consciousness and says his name is Mr. Jones, which the Hardys believe to be a thinly-disguised alias. The next day, both Mr. Hardy and Mr. Jones disappear. Frank and Joe seek out Mr. Hardy's informant at the maritime docks, Pretzel Pete, to see if he knows anything about the smugglers. Frank and Joe revisit the Shore Road area, and inside the house not far from the house on the cliff, Frank sees Mr. Hardy's hat. With their friends Chet Morton, Biff Hooper and Tony Prito, they use a boat to search for a secret tunnel at the base of the cliff. Frank and Joe try to rescue Mr. Hardy but they are also captured at gunpoint. Chet and Tony go to the United States Coast Guard and find Biff Hooper, Jerry Gilroy, and Phil Cohen there and lead them to the smuggler's secret cave. It turns out that Mr. Jones was a spy working for the Coast Guard. At the end the Hardys escape into the house on the cliff and capture Snattman while he is negotiating with police. Snattman apologizes and describes his life as difficult. As an infant, he lost his father, and he inherited the house from his dead uncle. His uncle was mean to him, and he never really had the opportunity to be properly trained. As a result, he wanted to turn the house into a Boys' Home, one where boys who are not properly trained can come to live. Mistakes on the Cover Illustration The front cover of the revised edition shows three boys in a boat, but in the text four boys are described being in the boat. The boys include Joe Hardy, Frank Hardy, Chet Morton and Biff Hooper. Alternative Version In 2002 St. Martin's Minotaur published The House On The Point, an homage to \\"The House on the Cliff\\" by Benjamin Hoff. Hoff wrote this book as a tribute to Franklin W. Dixon and The Hardy Boys, who had provided him with much entertainment during his youth. He did this by taking the original 1927 edition and stripping out all the details to form an outline of the story similar to, in his opinion, the outline Leslie McFarlane would have received from the Stratemeyer Syndicate. He then reimagined the story using his own version of the familiar Hardy Boys characters, making many minor changes, such as the case which Fenton Hardy is investigating, and more significant changes to the characters and their personalities. For example, in this reimagined version Callie Shaw and Iola Morten play an active role in investigating the Polucca residence and Callie shows her concern for Frank by giving him a kiss on the lips. Note that this would not likely have been permitted in the original, for (as McFarlane writes in \\"Ghost of the Hardy Boys\\" ) Stratemeyer expected the girls to make only occasional appearances and to have relationships with the boys that \\"would not go beyond the borders of wholesome friendship and discreet mutual esteem.\\" References Category:The Hardy Boys books Category:1927 American novels Category:1927 children's books Category:1959 American novels Category:1959 children's books Category:Grosset & Dunlap books ","title":"The House on the Cliff"},{"id":"2073290","text":"The Secret of the Old Mill is Volume 3 in the original The Hardy Boys Mystery Stories published by Grosset & Dunlap.

Plot summary (Revised Edition)  The Hardy boys learn a case of counterfeit insecurities of Australians across the European border is somehow intertwined with a national security case their dad is working on. Frank and Joe help prevent 14-year-old cyclist Ken Blake from getting killed in an accident. As they help the boy up they see he is delivering an envelope to Victor Peters, a name that means something to the Hardys later on in the book. The Hardys learn that their friend Chet Morton has been tricked when asked to make change for what turned out to be a counterfeit twenty dollar bill, something that the police later confirm is becoming more common in their town of Bayport. Later, Joe is awakened by a clattering sound and sees a mysterious figure bicycling away from the Hardys' home. While investigating the disturbance a note is found that reads, \\"Drop case or else danger for you and your family.\\" The Hardy boys are not sure if this threat refers to the counterfeiting case that Frank and Joe are investigating or another case their detective dad, Fenton Hardy, is trying to solve. The Hardys go with Chet, who wants to apply for a job at Elekton Controls, a missile-development company, but are told by Mr. Markel, one of Elekton's security guards, that there are no openings. Before leaving, they notice a bike that looks similar to the one ridden by Ken Blake and that is likely to have been used by the person who left the threatening note. Mr. Docker, an Elekton maintenance man, tells them that Ken does odd jobs for the company, but that he is not there at that time, even though Joe is certain he saw Ken looking out an adjacent old watermill's window at them. The Hardys, their girlfriends, Iola Morton and Callie Shaw and Chet go nearby to have a picnic but an arrow is shot at them with an attached note reading, \\"Danger. Hardys beware.\\" The Hardy brothers receive a gift of a motorboat they call The Sleuth, and show it to their friend, Tony Prito. Tony says the construction supply yard he is working at for the summer has become the latest to receive counterfeit money used to pay for lumber by a boy matching the description of Ken Blake. The Hardys take The Sleuth to the mill to investigate and find the mill wheel starting and stopping. Soon, they are attacked and left without gas in their new boat. They recover and get back to investigating by finding Ken who says he thinks someone has used his bike the same night that Joe saw someone bicycling from the Hardy's home. Markel and Docker pull Ken away and then a suspicious vehicle leaves Elekton. Later, the same suspicious vehicle gets away before an explosion at Elekton. Frank and Joe are terrified that their dad is inside the burning building. He was in the building but survived the explosion revealing that he was there to stop the attack after realizing there is a pattern to similar type attacks going on around similar companies in the United States. Eager to learn more from Ken, the Hardys soon find that Ken has been released from Elekton. The Hardys find him at a boarding house and he explains that the bricks and lumber bought with the counterfeit money were being used for a project at the mill. Frank and Joe return to the old mill and realize that the wheel mill is set up to act as a signaling device for the people living inside; an electric-eye stops the flow of electricity to the wheel. It acts as a warning to those inside that someone is approaching the mill. Going inside the mill at a time when they know no one else is there, they discover a secret room hidden by the lumber bought with counterfeit money. In the secret room, they find the tools used to make the fake money, but before they can get away the villains return to the mill. Frank and Joe escape through a tunnel but are captured by Docker and Markel. Victor Peters arrives and these three villains reveal that Docker shot the arrow at the girlfriends and Markel used the bike to deliver the note to the Hardys' home. Docker and Markel also explain that, without the knowledge of Victor Peters, they allowed another villain, Paul Blum, into Elekton to attack the place, which is the case that Fenton Hardy was investigating. Blum reveals that he is working for other countries who wish to stop United States missile development. Frank and Joe take advantage of an opportunity and overtake the villains.

The original version of this title is noted for being the first Hardy Boys book in which Aunt Gertrude makes an appearance. Plot summary (revised edition) At the beginning of the book the boys take their new boat, the Sleuth, out on the bay. While they are cruising on the bay another boat nearly rams them. They are unable to give chase because of a damaged steering mechanism on boat, and the boys end up going around in circles. It turns out that the boat that nearly rammed them had a purpose for doing so, but the reason why is not revealed until the end of the book. Soon after, the boys prepare to go to Callie Shaw's costume party. They inadvertently stumble upon another part of the unraveling mystery as they see some unknown men in Mr. French's Costume Shop, who appear to threaten him. Returning home, the boys frighten their Aunt Gertrude with their costumes. (Aunt Gertrude is a recurring character in the series.) Soon the boys are off to the costume party on their motorcycles. On the way they realize that the bank is being robbed. They follow the criminals until they lose them at the docks, where they hop into a boat and escape into the fog. After notifying the United States Coast Guard, the boys gain permission from Chief Collig to search for the criminals in the Sleuth, but the boys discover the Sleuth has been stolen. The boys search for the bank robbers in Tony Prito's boat, the Napoli, but are unable to find them in the thickening fog. The boys return home, explain to their father everything they saw at the bank and during the chase, and then head out to the costume party. The next day the boys awaken to learn that Chet Morton and Biff Hooper never made it home from the party. The boys not only have to learn who stole the Sleuth, but where their missing friends went, and who robbed the bank. As the story develops the boys learn that expensive radios that may have been stolen are turning up. Lastly, a hermit on a tiny island with a shotgun threatens the boys. Soon they rescue their friends and escape. The book ends saying that Frank and Joe would soon start a new case \\"in the near future while Hunting for Hidden Gold.\\"' Plot summary (original edition) The original story opens with Chet Morton and Biff Hooper preparing for a week-long boating trip in Biff's new motorboat Envoy. As Frank and Joe are instructing Biff on the handling of the craft in Barmet Bay, another boat occupied by three men menaces them, nearly causing Envoy to collide with two sailboats. The Hardy Boys note that the three men were closely watching Chet and Biff, which becomes important later in the story. The next day, an excited Chet and Biff leave for their boating trip on the Envoy. Both friend Tony Prito in his boat Napoli and Frank and Joe in their Sleuth decide to escort their friends to the end of the bay to see them off on their journey. Frank and Joe take Callie Shaw and Iola Morton as passengers. But before any of them reach the ocean, a violent squall strikes the bay and the Sleuth is forced to turn back to port, nearly capsizing. Soon after, Napoli also returns and Tony reports that Envoy did not turn back, and that Biff and Chet decided to press on through the storm. The boat was last seen headed out to the open ocean. After three days with no word from their friends, Frank and Joe organize a search effort to find trace of them. Before they can begin, however, their plans are interrupted by the arrival of their Aunt Gertrude, who has come for an extended visit, and doesn't approve of \\"letting children go out in boats.\\" With the approval of Mrs. Hardy, they eventually begin searching up the coast, accompanied again by Tony Prito in his Napoli. No villages up the coast have seen any sign of Biff's boat, though the boys do find some anonymous wreckage on a reef which leads them to believe that disaster struck the Envoy. They return home in defeat, and Chet and Biff are presumed dead by the community. Several days later, however, their hopes are restored when Aunt Gertrude opens a letter addressed to her brother Fenton Hardy. It is from Baldy Turk's gang, who claim to have kidnapped Frank and Joe, and are demanding ransom for their return. Frank and Joe, obviously not kidnapped, deduce that gangsters must be holding Chet and Biff, mistakenly believing that they are the Hardy Brothers. At this time, Tony also remembers that Biff once mentioned going down the coast, to Blacksnake Island. After one misadventure where Frank and Joe believe they have spotted Chet on a schooner, the boys approach Blacksnake Island to see the same boat which had menaced them on the bay leaving it. They land on the island and search for signs of Chet and Biff, eventually finding them being held captive in a cave by Baldy Turk's gang. After briefly freeing their friends, all the boys are recaptured, and hear news that Fenton Hardy has also been taken by the gang. They escape again, but Frank and Joe get separated from their friends once more in the darkness. They reach their boat, and steal the gang's boats as well, leaving the criminals stranded on the island with Chet and Biff. The Hardys return with the authorities and round up the gang, finally releasing their friends from captivity. They return home to find that their father is also safe, and had arrested Baldy Turk while Frank and Joe had helped capture the rest of his gang.  Mistakes on the Cover Illustration  The cover of the revised edition shows Frank and Joe spotting Chet and Biff in a distant boat as lightning strikes down. This scene takes place on page 139 of the revised edition. The image is sometimes confused with a similar scene in the original edition.

Description Species of Enoplometopus occur from coral reefs at depths of less than to rocky reefs at depths of . They are brightly coloured, with stripes, rings, or spots. They are typically mainly red, orange, purplish and white. Reef lobsters are small (depending on species, up to ), nocturnal (spending the day in caves or crevices), and very timid. The species can be distinguished by their colouration and morphology. Fossil Eryma mandelslohi As a result of their bright colours, they are popular in the aquarium trade, and unregulated collection combined with destruction of coral reefs may threaten some species. Due to uncertainty over the impact of these potential threats, the majority are considered data deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Reef lobsters are distinguished from clawed lobsters (family Nephropidae) by having full chelae (claws) only on the first pair of pereiopods, the second and third pairs being only subchelate (where the last segment of the appendage can press against a short projection from the penultimate one). Clawed lobsters have full claws on the first three pereiopods. Males, unlike those of nephropoid lobsters, have an extra lobe on the second pleopod, which is assumed to have some function in reproduction. Reef lobsters have a shallow cervical groove while clawed lobsters have a deep cervical groove.

The police were looking for a suspect who had stolen a car. The police thought they found their man. They found Jack Dodd's fishing rod in the trunk of one of the stolen cars. Jack insisted that he had not put it there and that he was being framed. The cops handcuffed Jack and his father and took them down to headquarters. Later that night Chief Collig came to the Hardy's home telling them that the Dodds had taken off in their station wagon. A relative of the Dodds is trying to find a solution to an old mystery an ancestor had in the Bayport area. =Original edition= While riding their motorcycles along the Shore Road the Hardy boys, along with their pal Chet Morton, meet a local fisherman who has just had his car stolen. The three boys give chase, but are delayed due to an accident with a horse-drawn hay wagon. Further down the road they find their chum, Jack Dodd, and his father being questioned by the police because a stolen car was found in their yard with Jack's fishing rod in the back seat. The Hardy boys resolve to solve the case and clear their friend's name. While investigating the case the Hardy boys identify suspects including a band of tramps camping on the beach, a man named Gus Montrose who used to work for Mr. Dodd, and a group of fishermen sneaking around the woods at night. The Hardy boys, along with their father Fenton Hardy, the Bayport Police force, State Troopers and a number of other curious people all attempt to investigate the car thefts; however, everyone involved is stumped because the cars seem to disappear without a trace and are not spotted leaving either end of the Shore Road area. Because of this the Hardy boys believe that the cars are still in the area, but well hidden, so they devise a plan to trap the car thieves. After purchasing a nice looking roadster the Hardy boys park the car along the Shore Road and hide in a large locker on the back. During the first night the car does get some troubles to get started and thief leaves it but on the next night it is stolen, with the boys in the locker, and driven to the thieves‚Äô secret hideout where the boys are discovered. After some excitement (involving guns), the Hardy boys manage to escape and alert the police who surround the area and arrest all of the thieves (including Gus Montrose) and recover the stolen vehicles.

ZEI has participated in research, policy advice, and dialogue between science and practice since its establishment in 1995. ZEI also offers graduate education and mid-career training opportunities to contribute to the resolution of unresolved issues of European integration and the shaping of Europe's global role.http://www.wissenschaftsregion- bonn.de/zentrum-integrationsforschung.html ZEI directors are Prof. Dr. Ludger K√ºhnhardt and Prof. Dr. Christian Koenig. Background and Structure The Berlin-Bonn Act of May 29, 1994‚Äìdealing with the consequence of the move of Germany‚Äôs national political institutions from Bonn to Berlin - provided for the establishment of a \\"Center for European Integration Studies‚Äù (ZEI) and a \\"Center for Development Research‚Äù (ZEF) as central scientific institutions of the University of Bonn. On May 4, 1995 the Senate of the University of Bonn agreed to establish these two centers. The overall concept was formulated in consultation with the participating organs of the federal government and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is based on an original proposal of the Senate of the University of Bonn from February 11, 1993. The Senate decision of May 4, 1995 is considered the founding date of the \\"Center for European Integration Studies\\" (ZEI) and the \\"Center for Development Research.\\" (ZEF) According to the founding resolution of the Senate of the University of Bonn of May 4, 1995, the tasks of ZEI are as follows: \\"ZEI will function as a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary institution aimed working on problems in the areas of political, legal, economic, social and cultural integration disparities in a regional and pan-European context. ZEI will conduct basic research in the conceptual area that encourages integration of research and to coordinate these efforts within the University and externally. ZEI is to take part in the solutions of concrete problems of integration by offering practical advice. All in all ZEI sees itself as a platform for the discussion of policy issues, a place to develop concepts, hypotheses and models. As an interface between theory and practice, ZEI focuses on institutional- and capacity-building in the field of integration research in Europe. ZEI can only realize its aforementioned goals through consistent openness to the public, through inclusion of guest researchers and through close cooperation with non- university institutions to integrate research, practice and integration of the European Union.‚Äù Research and Post-Graduate (Master)Education The Center for European Integration Studies (ZEI) provides future oriented research on unresolved issues of European integration and the global role of Europe.

He represented New Jersey in the Continental Congress as well as the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate. Biography James was born in New Brunswick in the Province of New Jersey and attended Queen's College (now Rutgers University), graduating in 1775. When he graduated he raised a volunteer company in New Brunswick and led it as Captain in the Middlesex County militia. He led them in the Battle of Brooklyn on August 27, 1776 where he was captured. He was held as a prisoner of war until early in the spring of 1777 when he escaped to rejoin the Continental Army at Morristown. Schureman returned to New Brunswick and took up a mercantile career while still serving in the militia. He was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly from 1783 to 1785. In 1786, New Jersey sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress. That same year he was one of those at the Annapolis Convention that called for a new constitution for the United States. He continued in the Congressional session of 1787, then was returned to the state assembly in 1788. When the United States was formed, Schureman was elected to the First House of Representatives, serving from 1789 until 1791. He served two other terms in the House, in the 9th Congress (1797‚Äì1799) and 14th Congress (1813‚Äì1815). He was elected to the U.S. Senate to complete the term of John Rutherfurd and served there from 1799 to 1801. Between these duties he served a number of years as the Mayor of New Brunswick, New Jersey including 1792-1794, 1801-1813, and 1821-1824\\\\. He also represented Middlesex County, New Jersey on the New Jersey Legislative Council for the 1808, 1810, and 1812-1813 sessions of the legislature, serving as Vice-President of Council in the latter session. When Schureman died in 1824 at New Brunswick, he was buried in the churchyard of the First Dutch Reformed Church there. The church and cemetery still stand and are located at Neilson and Bayard Streets.

Leiden: Sidestone Press, 2013, , pp. 73 ff. Thick-walled saltpans were filled with saltwater and heated from below until the water had boiled away and salt was left behind. Often, the bulk of the water would be allowed to evaporate in salterns before the concentrated brine was transferred to a smaller briquetage vessel for final reduction. Once only salt was left, the briquetage vessels would have to be broken to remove the valuable commodity for trade. Lane & Morris (2001) A Millennium of Saltmaking: Prehistoric and Romano-British Salt Production in the Fenland Broken briquetage material is found at multiple sites from the later Bronze Age in Europe into the medieval period and archaeologists have been able to identify different forms and fabrics of the pottery, allowing trade networks to be identified. Saltworking sites contain large quantities of the orange/red material and in Essex the mounds of briquetage are known as Red Hills. A recent discovery at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in Lunca, Neamt County, Romania, indicates that Neolithic people of the Precucuteni Culture were boiling the salt-laden spring water through the process of Briquetage to extract the salt as far back as 6050 BC, making it perhaps the oldest saltworks in history.

March 28, 2014. Accessed April 11, 2018. Afro-Seminole Creole was first identified in 1978 by Ian Hancock, a linguist at the University of Texas. Before that, no one in the academic world was aware of its existence. ASC arose when enslaved Gullah speakers from the South Carolina and Georgia coastal region, later called \\"Black Seminoles,\\" escaped from slavery on rice plantations and fled into the Florida wilderness. This process began in the late 1600s, and continued into the 1830s. In Florida, the Black Seminoles built their own independent communities, but established a close partnership with the Seminole Indians. That alliance helped protect both groups during the First and Second Seminole Wars. The present-day speakers of Afro-Seminole Creole live in Seminole County, Oklahoma and Brackettville, Texas in the United States, and in Nacimiento de los Negros, Coahuila, Mexico. ASC is threatened with extinction as there are only about 200 native speakers today. The speakers of ASC are all descendants of the Black Seminoles who settled in Florida and then, through a series of wars and other threats, were driven first to what is now Oklahoma and Northern Mexico, and later into Texas after the Civil War. The speakers of ASC are all 65 years of age or older, so unless actions are soon taken, ASC will likely be extinct in one or two decades.

The show generally features a single guest (though small groups and duos are also featured at times), and usually consists of about an equal mixture of discussion and playing, often duets with McPartland. Initially the guests were limited to jazz pianists, but the format was later expanded to include performers on other instruments as well as other genres (though the performances remain focused on jazz tunes). The show provides an inside look at the relationships of jazz musicians, since McPartland often had long friendships with many of her guests. Piano Jazz won a Peabody Award in 1983.

History  During the 1880s, a group of Maltese youngsters was watching English soldiers playing football at the Verdala Barracks; an officer gave the young Maltese a ball and that was the start of the game on the island.

She was the co-founder and partner of law firm Lee & Lee. Overview Kwa Geok Choo was the daughter of Kwa Siew Tee, former general manager of Oversea-Chinese Bank and Singapore Municipal Commissioner who was a Tong'anese on his paternal side who also had a Teochew mother, and Wee Yew Neo, Geok Choo's Teochew mother from Shantou. Kwa attended the Methodist Girls' School, Raffles Institution and Raffles College, and was a Queen's Scholar of Malaya. According to Lee Kuan Yew's memoirs, by 1939, Kwa and Lee were both top students in Raffles, often coming first and second in exams. They continued their courtship during the Japanese occupation when their studies were disrupted. After the war, Kwa resumed her studies at Raffles College in 1946 while Lee left Singapore to pursue his law degree at the University of Cambridge. Kwa was admitted to Girton College in 1947, after Lee petitioned for her, saying she was \\"a very bright girl, brighter than I was\\". She graduated with first-class honours in 1949 and was called to the bar in the subsequent year. She returned to Singapore and was admitted to the Colony Bar in 1951. Kwa was one of the few female lawyers of the country then, practising at Laycock & Ong. Kwa married Lee in secret in London in 1947 and then remarried in Singapore on 30 September 1950. They had two sons ‚Äì Lee Hsien Loong and Lee Hsien Yang ‚Äì and a daughter ‚Äì Lee Wei Ling. Her brother, Kwa Soon Bee, served as a Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health. She had three sisters: Mrs Cheah, a teacher at Methodist Girls' School; Mrs Yong, the wife of Yong Nyuk Lin; and Mrs Earnest Lau, who was also a teacher at Methodist Girls School. On 1 September 1955, Kwa Geok Choo founded law firm Lee & Lee with Lee Kuan Yew and Dennis Lee Kim Yew. Kwa practised conveyancing and legal draftsmanship. She retired from partnership in 1987 but stayed on as a consultant thereafter. During Lee's years as Prime Minister and Senior Minister, Kwa was frequently seen with her husband, especially on diplomatic trips and meetings with other foreign ministers. After suffering two strokes in May and June 2008, she was bedridden and developed locked-in syndrome, being unable to speak, but remained conscious and able to understand speech. Civil and political work Kwa Geok Choo was a founding member of the People‚Äôs Action Party (PAP) and helped to draft the PAP Constitution. She made her first political speech on Radio Malaya on PAP's policy on women before the 1959 elections, advocating equal pay for women and for monogamous marriages. She mostly stayed out of the political limelight throughout her husband's career. When Singapore separated from the Malaysian Federation, Kwa drafted the clauses in the Separation Agreement for the guarantee of the water agreements between the Malaysian state of Johor and Singapore. This guarantee was done via an amendment to the Federal Constitution of Malaysia. Kwa was also a pioneer advocate of women's rights in Singapore. She spoke on family planning, and supported legal protection for women. Together with other women‚Äôs activists such as Chan Choy Siong, Kwa's suggestions were included into the landmark 1961 Women‚Äôs Charter, which sought to improve and protect the legal rights of women. Death Kwa died in her sleep at home, following a long illness on 2 October 2010 around 0540 hours SST. She was given a state funeral and cremated at Mandai Crematorium on 7 October 2010. Legacy In 2011, the Singapore Management University named its new law library, a new scholars programme and a top law graduate award after Kwa. In the same year, the National University of Singapore established a professorship in property law, a distinguished visitors programme, bursaries and scholarships in her honour. Nanyang Girls' High School also unveiled a bust of Kwa at its Yu Zhi Library, which is named after her. Her alma mater, the Methodist Girls' School, named their auditorium in her honour after it was refurbished in 2011. Singapore's Peranakan Museum currently displays Kwa's barrister wig on its third floor. =Cultural depictions= In 2011, former Far Eastern Economic Review comic artist Morgan Chua released In Memory of Kwa Geok Choo (1920-2010), a book of sketches and political cartoons in tribute to her. In October 2014, the Madame Tussauds Singapore museum unveiled wax figures of Kwa and Lee Kuan Yew seated and smiling together against a backdrop of red flowers formed in the shape of two hearts. The statues were created based on a photograph that was taken by Kwa's niece, Kwa Kim Li, of the pair on Valentine's Day in 2008 at Sentosa. In the same month, Cultural Medallion recipient Tan Swie Hian completed a painting of Kwa and Lee Kuan Yew entitled A Couple. The painting, which took Tan five years to complete, was partially damaged by a fire in 2013. It depicts Kwa and Lee in their youth, is based on a 1946 black-and-white photograph of the couple in the University of Cambridge, and incorporates in its background Tan's poem written in memory of Kwa. Tan said, \\"I have always felt [Madam Kwa] was a great woman who, despite her intelligence and capability, was also a humble and dedicated wife.\\" A Couple was donated to the National Library of Singapore in 2017 and is displayed at the National Library Building in Victoria Street. She remains symbolic as a recognised leader who impacted generations to come particularly on sensitive issues regarding water.

Effects generally begin within half an hour. It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein. Common side effect include headaches, sleepiness, dizziness. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, liver problems, confusion, and seizures. Use is not recommended in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Because of risk of injury, skeletal muscle relaxants should generally be avoided in geriatric patients. Methocarbamol is a centrally acting muscle relaxant. How it works is unclear, but it does not appear to affect muscles directly. Methocarbamol was approved for medical use in the United States in 1957. It is available as a generic medication. It is relatively inexpensive as of 2016. In 2017, it was the 178th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions.  Medical use  Methocarbamol is a muscle relaxant used to treat acute, painful musculoskeletal spasms in a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. However, there is limited and inconsistent published research on the medication's efficacy and safety in treating musculoskeletal conditions, primarily neck and back pain. Methocarbamol injection may have a beneficial effect in the control of the neuromuscular spasms of tetanus. It does not, however, replace the current treatment regimen. It is not useful in chronic neurological disorders, such as cerebral palsy or other dyskinesias. Currently, there is some suggestion that muscle relaxants may improve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis; however, there is insufficient data to prove its effectiveness as well as answer concerns regarding optimal dosing, choice of muscle relaxant, adverse effects, and functional status. = Comparison to similar agents = The clinical effectiveness of methocarbamol compared to other muscle relaxants is not well- known. One trial of methocarbamol versus cyclobenzaprine, a well-studied muscle relaxant, in those with localized muscle spasm found there was no significant differences in their effects on improved muscle spasm, limitation of motion, or limitation of daily activities.  Contraindications  There are few contraindications to methocarbamol. They include: * Hypersensitivity to methocarbamol or to any of the injection components. * For the injectable form, suspected kidney failure or renal pathology, due to large content of polyethylene glycol 300 that can increase pre-existing acidosis and urea retention. Side effects Methocarbamol is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant that has significant adverse effects, especially on the central nervous system. Potential side effects of methocarbamol include: * Most commonly drowsiness, blurred vision, headache, nausea, and skin rash. *Possible clumsiness (ataxia), upset stomach, flushing, mood changes, trouble urinating, itchiness, and fever. * Both tachycardia (fast heart rate) and bradycardia (slow heart rate) have been reported. *Hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylatic reactions are also reported. *May cause respiratory depression when combined with benzodiazepines, barbiturates, codeine, or other muscle relaxants. * May cause urine to turn black, blue or green. While the product label states that methocarbamol can cause jaundice, there is minimal evidence to suggest that methocarbamol causes liver damage. During clinical trials of methocarbamol, there were no laboratory measurements of liver damage indicators, such as serum aminotransferase (AST/ALT) levels, to confirm hepatotoxicity. Although unlikely, it is impossible to rule out that methocarbamol may cause mild liver injury with use. = Elderly = Skeletal muscle relaxants are associated with an increased risk of injury among older adults. Methocarbamol appeared to be less sedating than other muscle relaxants, most notably cyclobenzaprine, but had similar increased risk of injury. Methocarbamol is cited along with \\"most muscle relaxants\\" in the 2012 Beers Criteria as being \\"poorly tolerated by older adults, because of anticholinergic adverse effects, sedation, increased risk of fractures,\\" noting that \\"effectiveness dosages tolerated by older adults is questionable.\\" = Pregnancy = Methocarbamol is labeled by the FDA as a pregnancy category C medication. The teratogenic effects of the medication are not known and should be given to pregnant women only when clearly indicated. = Overdose = There is limited information available on the acute toxicity of methocarbamol. Overdose is used frequently in conjunction with CNS depressants such as alcohol or benzodiazepines and will have symptoms of nausea, drowsiness, blurred vision, hypotension, seizures, and coma. There are reported deaths with an overdose of methocarbamol alone or in the presence of other CNS depressants. = Abuse= Unlike other carbamates such as meprobamate and its prodrug carisoprodol, methocarbamol has greatly reduced abuse potential. Studies comparing it to the benzodiazepine lorazepam and the antihistamine diphenhydramine, along with placebo, find that methocarbamol produces increased \\"liking\\" responses and some sedative-like effects; however, at higher doses dysphoria is reported. It is considered to have an abuse profile similar to, but weaker than, lorazepam.  Interactions  Methocarbamol may inhibit the effects of pyridostigmine bromide. Therefore, methocarbamol should be used with caution in those with myasthenia gravis taking anticholinesterase medications. Methocarbamol may disrupt certain screening tests as it can cause color interference in laboratory tests for 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and in urinary testing for vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) using the Gitlow method. Pharmacology = Mechanism of action = The mechanism of action of methocarbamol has not currently been established. Its effect is thought to be localized to the central nervous system rather than a direct effect on skeletal muscles. It has no effect on the motor end plate or the peripheral nerve fiber. The efficacy of the medication is likely related to its sedative effect. Alternatively, methocarbamol may act via inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, similarly to carbamate. = Pharmacokinetics = In healthy individuals, the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0.20 and 0.80 L/h/kg. The mean plasma elimination half-life ranges between 1 and 2 hours, and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46% and 50%. The elimination half-life was longer in the elderly, those with kidney problems, and those with liver problems. = Metabolism = Methocarbamol is the carbamate derivative of guaifenesin, but does not produce guaifenesin as a metabolite, because the carbamate bond is not hydrolyzed metabolically; its metabolism is by Phase I ring hydroxylation and O-demethylation, followed by Phase II conjugation. All the major metabolites are unhydrolyzed carbamates.Methocarbamol. In: DRUGDEX System [intranet database]. Greenwood Village, Colorado: Thomson Healthcare; c1974‚Äì2009 [cited 2009 Feb 10]. Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol are also excreted in the urine. Society and culture Methocarbamol was approved as a muscle relaxant for acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in the United States in 1957. Muscle relaxants are widely used to treat low back pain, one of the most frequent health problems in industrialized countries. Currently, there are more than 3 million prescriptions filled yearly. Methocarbamol and orphenadrine are each used in more than 250,000 U.S. emergency department visits for lower back pain each year. In the United States, low back pain is the fifth most common reason for all physician visits and the second most common symptomatic reason. In 80% of primary care visits for low back pain, at least one medication was prescribed at the initial office visit and more than one third were prescribed two or more medications. The most commonly prescribed drugs for low back pain included skeletal muscle relaxants. Cyclobenzaprine and methocarbamol are on the U.S. Medicare formulary, which may account for the higher use of these products. =Economics= The generic formulation of the medication is relatively inexpensive, costing less than the alternative metaxalone in 2016. In the UK, the NHS pays about ¬£13 for 100 tablets of 750 mg of methocarbamol as of 2019. In the US the wholesale cost of this quantity is about US$10 as of 2020. =Marketing= Generic methocarbamol 750mg tablet. Methocarbamol without other ingredients is sold under the brand name Robaxin in the U.K., U.S., Canada and South Africa; it is marketed as Lumirelax in France, Ortoton in Germany and many other names worldwide. In combination with other active ingredients it is sold under other names: with acetaminophen (paracetamol), under trade names Robaxacet and Tylenol Body Pain Night; with ibuprofen as Robax Platinum; with acetylsalicylic acid as Robaxisal in the U.S. and Canada. However, in Spain the tradename Robaxisal is used for the paracetamol combination instead of Robaxacet. These combinations are also available from independent manufacturers under generic names.  Research  Although opioids are a typically first line in treatment of severe pain, several trials suggest that methocarbamol may improve recovery and decrease hospital length of stay in those with muscles spasms associated with rib fractures. However, methocarbamol was less useful in the treatment of acute traumatic pain in general. Long-term studies evaluating the risk of development of cancer in using methocarbamol have not been performed. There are currently no studies evaluating the effect of methocarbamol on mutagenesis or fertility. The safety and efficacy of methocarbamol has not been established in pediatric individuals below the age of 16 except in tetanus.

It is based on the 1979 novel Death Bite by Michael Maryk and Brent Monahan. According to Filmink the movie \\"kicked off his [Fonda's] straight to video phase that lasted through the ‚Äò80s.\\" Plot Reclusive millionaire philanthropist Jason Kincaid lost his brother to a massive taipan serpent during a hunting trip in Micronesia. The snake also bit him, but rather than dying from the venom he survived and seemingly developed a telepathic link with the creature, caused by the venom mutating the brain cells responsible for extrasensory perception. Haunted by visions of the snake's continued killings, Kincaid pays to have a poacher capture it and deliver it to his mansion outside San Diego. He hires psychiatrist and ESP researcher Tom Brasilian in the hopes that he can help him rid of the unwanted psychic link once and for all. In exchange, Kincaid offers to underwrite all of Brasilian's on-going research. However, a Satanic cult also has its eyes on the snake. As it is worshiped by the indigenous natives as the guardian of their underworld, they believe that it is, in fact, a demon and hopes to acquire it for worship. The cult hires ex-CIA agent Warren Crowley to steal the snake. Crowley bribes a sailor on the ship transporting it to the United States to help secure it, but the mole is killed when he attempts to look inside the snake's container and is bitten. The venom causes his blood vessels and visceral tissues to rapidly swell and he dies by falling overboard. As Brasilian insists on keeping the snake at his university laboratory until Kincaid's private lab is constructed, he oversees its transportation there, unknowingly being tailed by Crowley and his minder Deacon Tyrone. Kincaid's niece Suzanne, believing that his psychic link is actually a delusion brought on by the trauma of her father's death, attempts to kill the snake by secretly increasing the temperature of its container to a lethal 150 degrees. That night, Crowley and Tyrone break into the lab. Tyrone, realizing that the snake is overheated, opens the container. The snake promptly breaks loose and kills Tyrone and the lab director before escaping outside. Brasilian and Suzanne are summoned to the site by police, while Kincaid senses that the snake has broken loose. Brasilian surmises that the snake must go to a temperate environment, and searches a nearby greenhouse with Suzanne. The snake attacks them, and Brasilian barely manages to fend it off with a fire extinguisher. Police arrive, but Kincaid manages to ward them off by convincing them of the danger the creature poses. All three are taken into custody, and police are skeptical of Kincaid's claims and threaten to charge him with manslaughter for illicitly importing such a deadly animal. Meanwhile, the snake attacks a nearby sorority house and kills its inhabitants, an act Kincaid witnesses through his mental link. Crowley is threatened by the cult for his failure to secure the snake. He bribes the location of Kincaid's residence and travels there by van, believing the snake will eventually travel there at which point he can capture it. Meanwhile, Brasilian determines that Kincaid's psychic link can be used to track down the snake before it strikes again. He hooks him up to a brain-pattern monitoring device, and Kincaid begins having a telepathic episode, seeing the snake arrive at his house and kill Crowley. Kincaid can only shout out a few cryptic words before the connection is lost, and disappears before he can be questioned any further. Suzanne realizes that he was referring to their house, and she and Brasilian race to intercept him. Kincaid arrives at the house, where the snake has already killed a groundskeeper. Picking up an assault rifle, he searches the grounds but is repeatedly struck by more and more intense visions of the snake's previous kills, losing his gun in the process. Finally, he confronts the creature in the backyard, where the psychic energy causes spontaneous explosions around the two. He attacks it with a knife, but it quickly gains the upper hand and kills him. Brasilian and Suzanne arrive, and Brasilian picks up Kincaid's gun and shoots the snake to death. He and Suzanne leave as the snake's remains burn side-by-side with Kincaid.

Hollywood agent Martin Erlichman bought the rights to the novel for $5,000 for one year. According to Monahan, Erlichman was fond of optioning screenplays on spec, and had file cabinets filled with the works of many anxious writers seeking to hit it big. Having done nothing with the ‚Äò‚ÄôDeath Bite‚Äô‚Äô property in the interim, and only a couple months remaining on his option, Erlichman sought to take advantage of the tax breaks afforded in Canada's film industry at that time. The film was originally announced in January 1981 newspaper reports to begin shooting in February of that year. During the planning stages, the original aim was to use live snakes for portions of the attack sequences. Herpetologist and snake wrangler Bob Zappalorti was going to provide the reptiles and Raymond Mendez, a well known model-maker, insect wrangler, and photographer would create hand puppets for close-ups. A 14 foot Indian Rock Python was bought and stored in NYC for almost a year before the idea of using real reptiles was discarded. As pre-production went on, the film went through several rewrites and different directors who eventually left when principal photography failed to materialize. When filming finally started, original production studio Filmpro Limited went bankrupt less than a week in, and banking firm Cinequity Corporation took over bringing two inexperienced men on board as producers. Fearing the film would fail to stand-out among the trend of ‚Äúanimal attack‚Äù movies coming out at the time, Cinequity rewrote the script to add supernatural elements, replaced the wrangled snakes with animatronics, and brought on-board director William Fruet in May 1981. Filming took place in- and-around various locations in Toronto, Ontario. The Kincaid estate was Valley Halla Estate by the Rouge River, and the opening sequence was filmed at Scarborough Bluffs Park. The animatronics used to realize the snake were designed by Mendez and Neal Martz. Originally six different snakes‚Äîeach performing its own function‚Äîwere to be built, but with a limited amount of money and time constraints, this idea was scrapped and doing as much as possible with a single mechanical snake was considered more feasible. While filming commenced in Canada, Mendez and his small crew of six built their robot monster in New York in autonomy over the course of eight weeks between August and October 1981. Two 22 ft bodies, three 6 ft necks to accommodate an armature, and puppet heads were used to bring creatures to life. The gore effects, including the graphic results of the snake's bite, were designed and realized by Academy Award-winning makeup artists Dick Smith and Stephan Dupuis, and featured heavily the former's signature air bladder technique. Invited to watch the filming in Toronto, both Maryk and Monahan left after three days upon becoming irritated with the constant alterations being made to their work. Despite the impressive nature of the finished product, Fruet was unsatisfied with how it looked on-screen when interacting with the live actors, and limited its appearance in the final film through the use of POV shots and quick edits. A climactic end battle between Oliver Reed and the snake was planned and filmed. It included scenes of the snake partially swallowing Reed's arm, and him stabbing and dismembering it with a knife. Fruet was unsatisfied with the effects, and heavily re-edited the sequence, cutting most of the snake's appearances and padding it out with flashbacks. Other extended, gory sequences were either planned or filmed, including a nightmare sequence in which some victims of the snake show up covered with graphic wounds. Fruet claims that additional shots with more graphic violence were filmed specifically for the East Asian release of the film. Fonda said in 1990 that \\"They couldn't figure out how to end the damn film. I told Ollie that it's up to him to make that huge snake look good...'You've got to make it look like it's going to kill you Ollie!' He was probably sober part of the time. It's really too bad. He‚Äôs a joke on himself. You know, the poor guy is very talented. It's just that he's simply become a caricature of himself.\\" Release The film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by Producers Distributing Corporation in May 1984. The film was released on VHS by Thorn EMI. In April 2016, CodeRed released the film on DVD and Blu-ray for the first time. Because the print used for the release was missing a reel, CodeRed substituted with Standard Definition footage from a VHS master. Soundtrack The film's score was composed by Eric Robertson. Tangerine Dream contributed the original theme over the end credits.

Early career Denham's career started at school, where he was active in producing pop music productions in school concerts, organizing pop quizzes and writing and performing parody songs. He worked privately as a DJ in his own time. After leaving school, he began his first live show at the \\"Radio Forest\\" community hospital radio station, based in Epping, Essex. He later became chairman of the organisation and is still a member there today. His early broadcasting career was at BBC Radio Kent, Invicta FM, (where he once fell asleep during an overnight show), SGR-FM in Essex and Chiltern FM in Dunstable. In 1992, Denham also began working as a stand up comedian in London, but gave it up to concentrate on breakfast radio. Hallam FM Denham moved to Hallam FM in South Yorkshire in 1996. He presented both the breakfast show and a late night spin-off \\"Daryl Denham's Unshaven Haven\\" (aka The X Rated Daryl Denham Show), which was a more risque version of a breakfast show format, featuring parody songs and skits. 100.7 Heart FM In 2000, Denham moved to 100.7 Heart FM in Birmingham, presenting their Breakfast Show and winning the Sony Radio Academy Awards Breakfast Music Award.Sony Radio Awards 2001 - Waveguide Sony Radio Academy Award winners - Radio Now 06/05/2001 He was summed up by the judges as \\"a welcome blast of fresh air....Daryl is a broadcaster who does not underestimate or patronise his audience and avoids relying on base, easy humour. He also showed a refreshing depth of understanding of the music played. An extremely rich and creative programme very worthy of a Gold Award.\\" Whilst at Heart FM, he performed several spoof sketches, off-the-cuff jokes and wacky competitions. He remained there until December 2001.

It has been characterised as cybernetics where \\"circularity is taken seriously\\".Glanville, R. (2004). The purpose of second-order cybernetics. Kybernetes, 33(9/10), 1379-1386. doi: 10.1108/03684920410556016 Cybernetics of cybernetics and the new cybernetics Second-order Cybernetics can be abbreviated as C2 or SOC, and is sometimes referred to as the cybernetics of cybernetics, the new cybernetics or second cybernetics.Gordon Pask. Introduction Different Kinds of Cybernetics. In Gertrudis van de Vijver (Ed) New Perspectives on Cybernetics. Springer Netherlands. pp 11-31. The terms are often used interchangeably, but can also stress different aspects: * Most commonly, second-order cybernetics refers to the practice of cybernetics where cyberneticians understand themselves to be part of the system they study. This is strongly associated with Heinz von Foerster. * More specifically, and especially where phrased as the cybernetics of cybernetics, it refers to the recursive application of cybernetics to itself and the practice of cybernetics in accordance with its own ideas. This is closely associated with Mead's 1967 address to the American Society for Cybernetics (published 1968)Mead, Margaret. \\"The Cybernetics of Cybernetics.\\" In Purposive Systems, edited by Heinz von Foerster, John D.

Initial development Second-order cybernetics took shape during the late 1960s and mid 1970s. The 1967 keynote address to the inaugural meeting of the American Society for Cybernetics (ASC) by Margaret Mead, who had been a participant at the Macy Conferences, is a defining moment in its development. She characterised \\"cybernetics as a way of looking at things and as a language for expressing what one sees\\". This paper was socialKrippendorff, K. (2008). Cybernetics‚Äôs Reflexive Turns.

Retrieved from http://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/136 and ecological in focus, with Mead calling on cyberneticians to assume responsibility for the social consequences of the language of cybernetics and the development of cybernetic systems. Mead's paper concluded with a proposal directed at the ASC itself, that it organise itself in the light of the ideas with which it was concerned. That is, the practice of Cybernetics by the ASC should be subject to Cybernetic critique, an idea returned to specially by Ranulph Glanville in his time as president of the society.Glanville, Ranulph. \\"Introduction: A Conference Doing the Cybernetics of Cybernetics.\\" Kybernetes 40, no. 7/8 (2011): 952-63.Glanville, Ranulph, ed.

With Mead uncontactable due to field work at the time, von Foerster titled the paper \\"Cybernetics of Cybernetics\\",von Foerster, Heinz. Understanding Understanding: Essays on Cybernetics and Cognition. New York, NY: Springer-Verlag, 2003. a title that perhaps emphasised his concerns more than Mead's. Von Foerster promoted Second-order Cybernetics energetically, developing it as a means of renewal for Cybernetics generally and as what has been called an \\"unfinished revolution\\" in science.M√ºller, Albert, and Karl H. M√ºller, eds. An Unfinished Revolution? Heinz Von Foerster and the Biological Computer Laboratory (BCL), 1958-1976. Vienna: Edition Echoraum, 2007. Von Foerster developed Second-order Cybernetics as a critique of realism and objectivity and as a radically reflexive form of science, where observers enter their domains of observation, describing their own observing not the supposed causes. The initial development of second-order cybernetics was consolidated by the mid 1970s in a series of significant developments and publications: * The 1974 publication of the \\"Cybernetics of Cybernetics\\" book, edited by Von Foerster. This was developed as a course option at the BCL and involved the examination of various texts from Cybernetics according to the principals they proposed. Here von Foerster defined Cybernetics of Cybernetics as \\"the control of control and the communication of communication\\" and differentiated first order cybernetics as \\"the cybernetics of observed systems\\" and second order cybernetics as \\"the cybernetics of observing systems\\". * Autopoiesis, developed by biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela.Varela, Francisco J., Humberto R.

Relationship to \\"first order\\" cybernetics Heinz von Foerster attributes the origin of second-order cybernetics to the attempts by cyberneticians to construct a model of the mind: > ... a brain is required to write a theory of a brain. From this follows that > a theory of the brain, that has any aspirations for completeness, has to > account for the writing of this theory. And even more fascinating, the > writer of this theory has to account for her or himself. Translated into the > domain of cybernetics; the cybernetician, by entering his own domain, has to > account for his or her own activity. Cybernetics then becomes cybernetics of > cybernetics, or second-order cybernetics.Von Foerster 2003, p.289. Many cyberneticians draw a sharp distinction between first and second order cybernetics, others stress the continuity between the two, and the implicit second order qualities of earlier cybernetics.Kline R.

Referring to the Macy conferences, it emphasises the requirement for a participant observer in the second order case: : ... essentially your ecosystem, your organism-plus-environment, is to be considered as a single circuit. In 1992, Pask summarized the differences between the old and the new cybernetics as a shift in emphasis:.Alessio Cavallaro, Annemarie Jonson, Darren Tofts (2003), Prefiguring Cyberculture: An Intellectual History, MIT Press, p.11.Evelyn Fox Keller, \\"Marrying the premodern to postmodern: computers and organism after World War II\\", in: M. Norton. Wise eds. Growing Explanations: Historical Perspectives on Recent Science, p 192. * ... from information to coupling * ... from the reproduction of \\"order-from-order\\" (Schroedinger 1944) to the generation of \\"order-from-noise\\" (von Foerster 1960) * ... from transmission of data to conversation * ... from external observation to participant observation ‚Äì an approach that could be assimilated to Maturana and Varela's concept of autopoiesis.  Topics  = In biology = Some biologists influenced by cybernetic concepts (Maturana and Varela, 1980; Varela, 1979; Atlan, 1979) realized that the cybernetic metaphors of the program upon which molecular biology had been based rendered a conception of the autonomy of the living being impossible. Consequently, these thinkers were led to invent a new cybernetics, one more suited to the organization mankind discovers in nature ‚Äì organizations he has not himself invented. The possibility that this new cybernetics could also account for social forms of organization, remained an object of debate among theoreticians on self- organization in the 1980s.Jean-Pierre Dupuy, \\"The autonomy of social reality: on the contribution of systems theory to the theory of society\\" in: Elias L. Khalil & Kenneth E. Boulding eds., Evolution, Order and Complexity, 1986. = In political science = In political science in the 1980s unlike its predecessor, the new cybernetics concerns itself with the interaction of autonomous political actors and subgroups and the practical reflexive consciousness of the subject who produces and reproduces the structure of political community. A dominant consideration is that of recursiveness, or self-reference of political action both with regard to the expression of political consciousness and with the ways in which systems build upon themselves.Peter Harries-Jones (1988), \\"The Self-Organizing Polity: An Epistemological Analysis of Political Life by Laurent Dobuzinskis\\" in: Canadian Journal of Political Science (Revue canadienne de science politique), Vol. 21, No. 2 (Jun., 1988), pp. 431‚Äì433. In 1978, Geyer and van der Zouwen discuss a number of characteristics of the emerging \\"new cybernetics\\". One characteristic of new cybernetics is that it views information as constructed by an individual interacting with the environment. This provides a new epistemological foundation of science, by viewing it as observer-dependent. Another characteristic of the new cybernetics is its contribution towards bridging the \\"micro-macro gap\\". That is, it links the individual with the society. Geyer and van der Zouten also noted that a transition from classical cybernetics to new cybernetics involves a transition from classical problems to new problems. These shifts in thinking involve, among other things, a change in emphasis on the system being steered to the system doing the steering, and the factors which guide the steering decisions. And a new emphasis on communication between several systems which are trying to steer each other.Kenneth D. Bailey (1994), Sociology and the New Systems Theory: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis, p.163. Geyer & J. van der Zouwen (1992) recognize four themes in both sociocybernetics and new cybernetics:R.F. Geyer and G. v.d. Zouwen (1992), \\"Sociocybernetics\\", in: Cybernetics and Applied Systems, C.V. Negoita ed. p.96. # An epistemological foundation for science as an observer-observer system. Feedback and feedforward loops are constructed not only between the observer, and the objects that are observed them and the observer. # The transition from classical, rather mechanistic first-order cybernetics to modern, second-order cybernetics, characterized by the differences summarized by Gordon Pask. # These problem shifts in cybernetics result from a thorough reconceptualization of many all too easily accepted and taken for granted concepts ‚Äì which yield new notions of stability, temporality, independence, structure versus behaviour, and many other concepts. # The actor-oriented systems approach, promulgated in 1978 made it possible to bridge the \\"micro-macro\\" gap in social science thinking.

Wells ea. eds., Information Transmission and Human Biology, p. 263. = Organizational cybernetics = Organizational cybernetics is distinguished from management cybernetics. Both use many of the same terms but interpret them according to another philosophy of systems thinking. Organizational cybernetics by contrast offers a significant break with the assumption of the hard approach. The full flowering of organizational cybernetics is represented by Beer's viable system model.Michael C. Jackson (1991), Systems Methodology for the Management Sciences. Organizational cybernetics studies organizational design, and the regulation and self- regulation of organizations from a systems theory perspective that also takes the social dimension into consideration. Researchers in economics, public administration and political science focus on the changes in institutions, organisation and mechanisms of social steering at various levels (sub- national, national, European, international) and in different sectors (including the private, semi-private and public sectors; the latter sector is emphasised).Organisational Cybernetics, Nijmegen School of Management, The Netherlands. = Sociocybernetics = The reformulation of sociocybernetics as an \\"actor-oriented, observer-dependent, self-steering, time-variant\\" paradigm of human systems, was most clearly articulated by Geyer and van der Zouwen in 1978 and 1986.Lauren Langman, \\"The family: a 'sociocybernetic' approach to theory and policy\\", in: R. Felix Geyer & J. van der Zouwen Eds. (1986), Sociocybernetic Paradoxes: Observation, Control and Evolution of Self-Steering Systems, Sage Publications Ltd, pp 26‚Äì43. They stated that sociocybernetics is more than just social cybernetics, which could be defined as the application of the general systems approach to social science. Social cybernetics is indeed more than such a one-way knowledge transfer. It implies a feed-back loop from the area of application ‚Äì the social sciences ‚Äì to the theory being applied, namely cybernetics; consequently, sociocybernetics can indeed be viewed as part of the new cybernetics: as a result of its application to social science problems, cybernetics, itself, has been changed and has moved from its originally rather mechanistic point of departure to become more actor-oriented and observer-dependent.R. Felix Geyer & J. van der Zouwen Eds. (1986), Sociocybernetic Paradoxes: Observation, Control and Evolution of Self- Steering Systems, Sage Publications Ltd, 248 pp. In summary, the new sociocybernetics is much more subjective and uses a sociological approach more than classical cybernetics approach with its emphasis on control. The new approach has a distinct emphasis on steering decisions; furthermore, it can be seen as constituting a reconceptualization of many concepts which are often routinely accepted without challenge.  Criticism  Andrew Pickering has criticised second order cybernetics as a form of linguistic turn, moving away from the performative practices he finds valuable in earlier cybernetics.Pickering, Andrew. The Cybernetic Brain: Sketches of Another Future. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 2010. Pickering's comments seem to apply specifically to where second order cybernetics has emphasised epistemology and language, for instance in the work of von Foerster, as he approvingly references the work of figures such as Bateson and Pask and the idea of participant observers which fall within the scope of second order cybernetics more broadly considered.

The surface of the Earth requires (at least) two charts to include every point. Here the globe is decomposed into charts around the North and South Poles. In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, an -dimensional manifold, or -manifold for short, is a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension . One-dimensional manifolds include lines and circles, but not figure eights (because no neighborhood of their crossing point is homeomorphic to Euclidean 1-space). Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces. Examples include the plane, the sphere, and the torus, which can all be embedded (formed without self-intersections) in three dimensional real space, but also the Klein bottle and real projective plane, which will always self- intersect when immersed in three-dimensional real space. Although a manifold locally resembles Euclidean space, meaning that every point has a neighbourhood homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space, globally it may be not homeomorphic to Euclidean space. For example, the surface of the sphere is not homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane, because (among other properties) it has the global topological property of compactness that Euclidean space lacks, but in a region it can be charted by means of map projections of the region into the Euclidean plane (in the context of manifolds they are called charts). When a region appears in two neighbouring charts, the two representations do not coincide exactly and a transformation is needed to pass from one to the other, called a transition map. The concept of a manifold is central to many parts of geometry and modern mathematical physics because it allows complicated structures to be described and understood in terms of the simpler local topological properties of Euclidean space. Manifolds naturally arise as solution sets of systems of equations and as graphs of functions. Manifolds can be equipped with additional structure. One important class of manifolds is the class of differentiable manifolds; this differentiable structure allows calculus to be done on manifolds. A Riemannian metric on a manifold allows distances and angles to be measured. Symplectic manifolds serve as the phase spaces in the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, while four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds model spacetime in general relativity.  Motivating examples  A surface is a two dimensional manifold, meaning that it locally resembles the Euclidean plane near each point. For example, the surface of a globe can be described by a collection of maps (called charts), which together form an atlas of the globe. Although no individual map is sufficient to cover the entire surface of the globe, any place in the globe will be in at least one of the charts. Many places will appear in more than one chart. For example, a map of North America will likely include parts of South America and the Arctic circle. These regions of the globe will be described in full in separate charts, which in turn will contain parts of North America. There is a relation between adjacent charts, called a transition map that allows them to be consistently patched together to cover the whole of the globe. Describing the coordinate charts on surfaces explicitly requires knowledge of functions of two variables, because these patching functions must map a region in the plane to another region of the plane. However, one-dimensional examples of manifolds (or curves) can be described with functions of a single variable only. Manifolds have applications in computer-graphics and augmented-reality given the need to associate pictures (texture) to coordinates (e.g. CT scans). In an augmented reality setting, a picture (tangent plane) can be seen as something associated with a coordinate and by using sensors for detecting movements and rotation one can have knowledge of how the picture is oriented and placed in space. = Circle = Figure 1: The four charts each map part of the circle to an open interval, and together cover the whole circle. After a line, the circle is the simplest example of a topological manifold. Topology ignores bending, so a small piece of a circle is treated exactly the same as a small piece of a line. Consider, for instance, the top part of the unit circle, x2 + y2 = 1, where the y-coordinate is positive (indicated by the yellow circular arc in Figure 1). Any point of this arc can be uniquely described by its x-coordinate. So, projection onto the first coordinate is a continuous, and invertible, mapping from the upper arc to the open interval (‚àí1, 1): : \\\\chi_{\\\\mathrm{top}}(x,y) = x . \\\\, Such functions along with the open regions they map are called charts. Similarly, there are charts for the bottom (red), left (blue), and right (green) parts of the circle: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{bottom}(x, y) &= x  \\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{left}(x, y) &= y  \\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{right}(x, y) &= y. \\\\end{align} Together, these parts cover the whole circle and the four charts form an atlas for the circle. The top and right charts, \\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{top} and \\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{right} respectively, overlap in their domain: their intersection lies in the quarter of the circle where both the x\\\\- and the y-coordinates are positive. Each map this part into the interval (0,1), though differently. Thus a function T:(0,1)\\\\rightarrow(0,1)=\\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{right} \\\\circ \\\\chi^{-1}_\\\\mathrm{top} can be constructed, which takes values from the co-domain of \\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{top} back to the circle using the inverse, followed by the \\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{right} back to the interval. Let a be any number in (0,1), then: : \\\\begin{align} T(a) &= \\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{right}\\\\left(\\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{top}^{-1}\\\\left[a\\\\right]\\\\right)  &= \\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{right}\\\\left(a, \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2}\\\\right)  &= \\\\sqrt{1 - a^2} \\\\end{align} Such a function is called a transition map. Figure 2: A circle manifold chart based on slope, covering all but one point of the circle. The top, bottom, left, and right charts show that the circle is a manifold, but they do not form the only possible atlas. Charts need not be geometric projections, and the number of charts is a matter of choice. Consider the charts : \\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{minus}(x, y) = s = \\\\frac{y}{1 + x} and : \\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{plus}(x, y) = t = \\\\frac{y}{1 - x} Here s is the slope of the line through the point at coordinates (x, y) and the fixed pivot point (‚àí1, 0); similarly, t is the opposite of the slope of the line through the points at coordinates (x, y) and (+1, 0). The inverse mapping from s to (x, y) is given by : \\\\begin{align} x &= \\\\frac{1 - s^2}{1 + s^2} \\\\[5pt] y &= \\\\frac{2s}{1 + s^2} \\\\end{align} It can easily be confirmed that x2 + y2 = 1 for all values of s and t. These two charts provide a second atlas for the circle, with the transition map : t = \\\\frac{1}{s} (that is, one has this relation between s and t for every point where s and t are both nonzero). Each chart omits a single point, either (‚àí1, 0) for s or (+1, 0) for t, so neither chart alone is sufficient to cover the whole circle. It can be proved that it is not possible to cover the full circle with a single chart. For example, although it is possible to construct a circle from a single line interval by overlapping and \\"gluing\\" the ends, this does not produce a chart; a portion of the circle will be mapped to both ends at once, losing invertibility. = Sphere = The sphere is an example of a surface. The unit sphere of implicit equation : may be covered by an atlas of six charts: the plane divides the sphere into two half spheres ( and ), which may both be mapped on the disc by the projection on the plane of coordinates. This provides two charts; the four other charts are provided by a similar construction with the two other coordinate planes. As for the circle, one may define one chart that covers the whole sphere excluding one point. Thus two charts are sufficient, but the sphere cannot be covered by a single chart. This example is historically significant, as it has motivated the terminology; it became apparent that the whole surface of the Earth cannot have a plane representation consisting of a single map (also called \\"chart\\", see nautical chart), and therefore one needs atlases for covering the whole Earth surface. = Enriched circle = Viewed using calculus, the circle transition function T is simply a function between open intervals, which gives a meaning to the statement that T is differentiable. The transition map T, and all the others, are differentiable on (0, 1); therefore, with this atlas the circle is a differentiable manifold. It is also smooth and analytic because the transition functions have these properties as well. Other circle properties allow it to meet the requirements of more specialized types of manifold. For example, the circle has a notion of distance between two points, the arc-length between the points; hence it is a Riemannian manifold. = Other curves = Four manifolds from algebraic curves: circles, parabola, hyperbola, cubic. Manifolds need not be connected (all in \\"one piece\\"); an example is a pair of separate circles. Manifolds need not be closed; thus a line segment without its end points is a manifold. And they are never countable, unless the dimension of the manifold is 0\\\\. Putting these freedoms together, other examples of manifolds are a parabola, a hyperbola (two open, infinite pieces), and the locus of points on a cubic curve (a closed loop piece and an open, infinite piece). However, excluded are examples like two touching circles that share a point to form a figure-8; at the shared point a satisfactory chart cannot be created. Even with the bending allowed by topology, the vicinity of the shared point looks like a \\"+\\", not a line. A \\"+\\" is not homeomorphic to a closed interval (line segment), since deleting the center point from the \\"+\\" gives a space with four components (i.e. pieces), whereas deleting a point from a closed interval gives a space with at most two pieces; topological operations always preserve the number of pieces.  Mathematical definition  Informally, a manifold is a space that is \\"modeled on\\" Euclidean space. There are many different kinds of manifolds, depending on the context. In geometry and topology, all manifolds are topological manifolds, possibly with additional structure, such as a differentiable structure. A manifold can be constructed by giving a collection of coordinate charts, that is a covering by open sets with homeomorphisms to a Euclidean space, and patching functions: homeomorphisms from one region of Euclidean space to another region if they correspond to the same part of the manifold in two different coordinate charts. A manifold can be given additional structure if the patching functions satisfy axioms beyond continuity. For instance, differentiable manifolds have homeomorphisms on overlapping neighborhoods diffeomorphic with each other, so that the manifold has a well-defined set of functions which are differentiable in each neighborhood, and so differentiable on the manifold as a whole. Formally, a (topological) manifold is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space. Second countable and Hausdorff are point-set conditions; second countable excludes spaces which are in some sense 'too large' such as the long line, while Hausdorff excludes spaces such as \\"the line with two origins\\" (these generalizations of manifolds are discussed in non-Hausdorff manifolds). Locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space means that every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open Euclidean n-ball, :\\\\mathbf{B}^n = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\mid x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\\\cdots + x_n^2 < 1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. More precisely, locally homeomorphic here means that each point m in the manifold M has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to an open neighborhood in Euclidean space, not to the unit ball specifically. However, given such a homeomorphism, the pre-image of an \\\\epsilon-ball gives a homeomorphism between the unit ball and a smaller neighborhood of m, so this is no loss of generality. For topological or differentiable manifolds, one can also ask that every point have a neighborhood homeomorphic to all of Euclidean space (as this is diffeomorphic to the unit ball), but this cannot be done for complex manifolds, as the complex unit ball is not holomorphic to complex space. Generally manifolds are taken to have a fixed dimension (the space must be locally homeomorphic to a fixed n-ball), and such a space is called an n-manifold; however, some authors admit manifolds where different points can have different dimensions.E.g. see ; . If a manifold has a fixed dimension, it is called a pure manifold. For example, the (surface of a) sphere has a constant dimension of 2 and is therefore a pure manifold whereas the disjoint union of a sphere and a line in three-dimensional space is not a pure manifold. Since dimension is a local invariant (i.e. the map sending each point to the dimension of its neighbourhood over which a chart is defined, is locally constant), each connected component has a fixed dimension. Scheme-theoretically, a manifold is a locally ringed space, whose structure sheaf is locally isomorphic to the sheaf of continuous (or differentiable, or complex-analytic, etc.) functions on Euclidean space. This definition is mostly used when discussing analytic manifolds in algebraic geometry.  Charts, atlases, and transition maps  The spherical Earth is navigated using flat maps or charts, collected in an atlas. Similarly, a differentiable manifold can be described using mathematical maps, called coordinate charts, collected in a mathematical atlas. It is not generally possible to describe a manifold with just one chart, because the global structure of the manifold is different from the simple structure of the charts. For example, no single flat map can represent the entire Earth without separation of adjacent features across the map's boundaries or duplication of coverage. When a manifold is constructed from multiple overlapping charts, the regions where they overlap carry information essential to understanding the global structure. = Charts = A coordinate map, a coordinate chart, or simply a chart, of a manifold is an invertible map between a subset of the manifold and a simple space such that both the map and its inverse preserve the desired structure. For a topological manifold, the simple space is a subset of some Euclidean space Rn and interest focuses on the topological structure. This structure is preserved by homeomorphisms, invertible maps that are continuous in both directions. In the case of a differentiable manifold, a set of charts called an atlas allows us to do calculus on manifolds. Polar coordinates, for example, form a chart for the plane R2 minus the positive x-axis and the origin. Another example of a chart is the map œátop mentioned in the section above, a chart for the circle. = Atlases = The description of most manifolds requires more than one chart (a single chart is adequate for only the simplest manifolds). A specific collection of charts which covers a manifold is called an atlas. An atlas is not unique as all manifolds can be covered multiple ways using different combinations of charts. Two atlases are said to be equivalent if their union is also an atlas. The atlas containing all possible charts consistent with a given atlas is called the maximal atlas (i.e. an equivalence class containing that given atlas (under the already defined equivalence relation given in the previous paragraph)). Unlike an ordinary atlas, the maximal atlas of a given manifold is unique. Though it is useful for definitions, it is an abstract object and not used directly (e.g. in calculations). = Transition maps = Charts in an atlas may overlap and a single point of a manifold may be represented in several charts. If two charts overlap, parts of them represent the same region of the manifold, just as a map of Europe and a map of Asia may both contain Moscow. Given two overlapping charts, a transition function can be defined which goes from an open ball in Rn to the manifold and then back to another (or perhaps the same) open ball in Rn. The resultant map, like the map T in the circle example above, is called a change of coordinates, a coordinate transformation, a transition function, or a transition map. = Additional structure = An atlas can also be used to define additional structure on the manifold. The structure is first defined on each chart separately. If all the transition maps are compatible with this structure, the structure transfers to the manifold. This is the standard way differentiable manifolds are defined. If the transition functions of an atlas for a topological manifold preserve the natural differential structure of Rn (that is, if they are diffeomorphisms), the differential structure transfers to the manifold and turns it into a differentiable manifold. Complex manifolds are introduced in an analogous way by requiring that the transition functions of an atlas are holomorphic functions. For symplectic manifolds, the transition functions must be symplectomorphisms. The structure on the manifold depends on the atlas, but sometimes different atlases can be said to give rise to the same structure. Such atlases are called compatible. These notions are made precise in general through the use of pseudogroups.  Manifold with boundary  A manifold with boundary is a manifold with an edge. For example, a sheet of paper is a 2-manifold with a 1-dimensional boundary. The boundary of an n-manifold with boundary is an -manifold. A disk (circle plus interior) is a 2-manifold with boundary. Its boundary is a circle, a 1-manifold. A square with interior is also a 2-manifold with boundary. A ball (sphere plus interior) is a 3-manifold with boundary. Its boundary is a sphere, a 2-manifold. (See also Boundary (topology)). In technical language, a manifold with boundary is a space containing both interior points and boundary points. Every interior point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the open n-ball Every boundary point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the \\"half\\" n-ball . The homeomorphism must send each boundary point to a point with x1 = 0\\\\. = Boundary and interior = Let M be a manifold with boundary. The interior of M, denoted Int M, is the set of points in M which have neighborhoods homeomorphic to an open subset of Rn. The boundary of M, denoted ‚àÇM, is the complement of IntM in M. The boundary points can be characterized as those points which land on the boundary hyperplane of Rn+ under some coordinate chart. If M is a manifold with boundary of dimension n, then IntM is a manifold (without boundary) of dimension n and ‚àÇM is a manifold (without boundary) of dimension .  Construction  A single manifold can be constructed in different ways, each stressing a different aspect of the manifold, thereby leading to a slightly different viewpoint. = Charts = The chart maps the part of the sphere with positive z coordinate to a disc. Perhaps the simplest way to construct a manifold is the one used in the example above of the circle. First, a subset of R2 is identified, and then an atlas covering this subset is constructed. The concept of manifold grew historically from constructions like this. Here is another example, applying this method to the construction of a sphere:  Sphere with charts  A sphere can be treated in almost the same way as the circle. In mathematics a sphere is just the surface (not the solid interior), which can be defined as a subset of R3: : S = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ (x,y,z) \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^3 \\\\mid x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. The sphere is two-dimensional, so each chart will map part of the sphere to an open subset of R2. Consider the northern hemisphere, which is the part with positive z coordinate (coloured red in the picture on the right). The function œá defined by : \\\\chi(x, y, z) = (x, y),\\\\ maps the northern hemisphere to the open unit disc by projecting it on the (x, y) plane. A similar chart exists for the southern hemisphere. Together with two charts projecting on the (x, z) plane and two charts projecting on the (y, z) plane, an atlas of six charts is obtained which covers the entire sphere. This can be easily generalized to higher-dimensional spheres. = Patchwork = A manifold can be constructed by gluing together pieces in a consistent manner, making them into overlapping charts. This construction is possible for any manifold and hence it is often used as a characterisation, especially for differentiable and Riemannian manifolds. It focuses on an atlas, as the patches naturally provide charts, and since there is no exterior space involved it leads to an intrinsic view of the manifold. The manifold is constructed by specifying an atlas, which is itself defined by transition maps. A point of the manifold is therefore an equivalence class of points which are mapped to each other by transition maps. Charts map equivalence classes to points of a single patch. There are usually strong demands on the consistency of the transition maps. For topological manifolds they are required to be homeomorphisms; if they are also diffeomorphisms, the resulting manifold is a differentiable manifold. This can be illustrated with the transition map t = 1‚ÅÑs from the second half of the circle example. Start with two copies of the line. Use the coordinate s for the first copy, and t for the second copy. Now, glue both copies together by identifying the point t on the second copy with the point s = 1‚ÅÑt on the first copy (the points t = 0 and s = 0 are not identified with any point on the first and second copy, respectively). This gives a circle.  Intrinsic and extrinsic view  The first construction and this construction are very similar, but they represent rather different points of view. In the first construction, the manifold is seen as embedded in some Euclidean space. This is the extrinsic view. When a manifold is viewed in this way, it is easy to use intuition from Euclidean spaces to define additional structure. For example, in a Euclidean space it is always clear whether a vector at some point is tangential or normal to some surface through that point. The patchwork construction does not use any embedding, but simply views the manifold as a topological space by itself. This abstract point of view is called the intrinsic view. It can make it harder to imagine what a tangent vector might be, and there is no intrinsic notion of a normal bundle, but instead there is an intrinsic stable normal bundle.  n-Sphere as a patchwork  The n-sphere Sn is a generalisation of the idea of a circle (1-sphere) and sphere (2-sphere) to higher dimensions. An n-sphere Sn can be constructed by gluing together two copies of Rn. The transition map between them is defined as :\\\\mathbf{R}^n \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{R}^n \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}: x \\\\mapsto x/\\\\x\\\\^2. This function is its own inverse and thus can be used in both directions. As the transition map is a smooth function, this atlas defines a smooth manifold. In the case n = 1, the example simplifies to the circle example given earlier. = Identifying points of a manifold = It is possible to define different points of a manifold to be same. This can be visualized as gluing these points together in a single point, forming a quotient space. There is, however, no reason to expect such quotient spaces to be manifolds. Among the possible quotient spaces that are not necessarily manifolds, orbifolds and CW complexes are considered to be relatively well-behaved. An example of a quotient space of a manifold that is also a manifold is the real projective space identified as a quotient space of the corresponding sphere. One method of identifying points (gluing them together) is through a right (or left) action of a group, which acts on the manifold. Two points are identified if one is moved onto the other by some group element. If M is the manifold and G is the group, the resulting quotient space is denoted by M / G (or G \\\\ M). Manifolds which can be constructed by identifying points include tori and real projective spaces (starting with a plane and a sphere, respectively). = Gluing along boundaries = Two manifolds with boundaries can be glued together along a boundary. If this is done the right way, the result is also a manifold. Similarly, two boundaries of a single manifold can be glued together. Formally, the gluing is defined by a bijection between the two boundaries. Two points are identified when they are mapped onto each other. For a topological manifold this bijection should be a homeomorphism, otherwise the result will not be a topological manifold. Similarly for a differentiable manifold it has to be a diffeomorphism. For other manifolds other structures should be preserved. A finite cylinder may be constructed as a manifold by starting with a strip [0, 1] √ó [0, 1] and gluing a pair of opposite edges on the boundary by a suitable diffeomorphism. A projective plane may be obtained by gluing a sphere with a hole in it to a M√∂bius strip along their respective circular boundaries. = Cartesian products = The Cartesian product of manifolds is also a manifold. The dimension of the product manifold is the sum of the dimensions of its factors. Its topology is the product topology, and a Cartesian product of charts is a chart for the product manifold. Thus, an atlas for the product manifold can be constructed using atlases for its factors. If these atlases define a differential structure on the factors, the corresponding atlas defines a differential structure on the product manifold. The same is true for any other structure defined on the factors. If one of the factors has a boundary, the product manifold also has a boundary. Cartesian products may be used to construct tori and finite cylinders, for example, as S1 √ó S1 and S1 √ó [0, 1], respectively. A finite cylinder is a manifold with boundary.  History  The study of manifolds combines many important areas of mathematics: it generalizes concepts such as curves and surfaces as well as ideas from linear algebra and topology. = Early development = Before the modern concept of a manifold there were several important results. Non-Euclidean geometry considers spaces where Euclid's parallel postulate fails. Saccheri first studied such geometries in 1733 but sought only to disprove them. Gauss, Bolyai and Lobachevsky independently discovered them 100 years later. Their research uncovered two types of spaces whose geometric structures differ from that of classical Euclidean space; these gave rise to hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry. In the modern theory of manifolds, these notions correspond to Riemannian manifolds with constant negative and positive curvature, respectively. Carl Friedrich Gauss may have been the first to consider abstract spaces as mathematical objects in their own right. His theorema egregium gives a method for computing the curvature of a surface without considering the ambient space in which the surface lies. Such a surface would, in modern terminology, be called a manifold; and in modern terms, the theorem proved that the curvature of the surface is an intrinsic property. Manifold theory has come to focus exclusively on these intrinsic properties (or invariants), while largely ignoring the extrinsic properties of the ambient space. Another, more topological example of an intrinsic property of a manifold is its Euler characteristic. Leonhard Euler showed that for a convex polytope in the three-dimensional Euclidean space with V vertices (or corners), E edges, and F faces, :V - E + F = 2.\\\\ The same formula will hold if we project the vertices and edges of the polytope onto a sphere, creating a topological map with V vertices, E edges, and F faces, and in fact, will remain true for any spherical map, even if it does not arise from any convex polytope.The notion of a map can formalized as a cell decomposition. Thus 2 is a topological invariant of the sphere, called its Euler characteristic. On the other hand, a torus can be sliced open by its 'parallel' and 'meridian' circles, creating a map with V = 1 vertex, E = 2 edges, and F = 1 face. Thus the Euler characteristic of the torus is 1 ‚àí 2 + 1 = 0\\\\. The Euler characteristic of other surfaces is a useful topological invariant, which can be extended to higher dimensions using Betti numbers. In the mid nineteenth century, the Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem linked the Euler characteristic to the Gaussian curvature. = Synthesis = Investigations of Niels Henrik Abel and Carl Gustav Jacobi on inversion of elliptic integrals in the first half of 19th century led them to consider special types of complex manifolds, now known as Jacobians. Bernhard Riemann further contributed to their theory, clarifying the geometric meaning of the process of analytic continuation of functions of complex variables. Another important source of manifolds in 19th century mathematics was analytical mechanics, as developed by Sim√©on Poisson, Jacobi, and William Rowan Hamilton. The possible states of a mechanical system are thought to be points of an abstract space, phase space in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms of classical mechanics. This space is, in fact, a high- dimensional manifold, whose dimension corresponds to the degrees of freedom of the system and where the points are specified by their generalized coordinates. For an unconstrained movement of free particles the manifold is equivalent to the Euclidean space, but various conservation laws constrain it to more complicated formations, e.g. Liouville tori. The theory of a rotating solid body, developed in the 18th century by Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gives another example where the manifold is nontrivial. Geometrical and topological aspects of classical mechanics were emphasized by Henri Poincar√©, one of the founders of topology. Riemann was the first one to do extensive work generalizing the idea of a surface to higher dimensions. The name manifold comes from Riemann's original German term, Mannigfaltigkeit, which William Kingdon Clifford translated as \\"manifoldness\\". In his G√∂ttingen inaugural lecture, Riemann described the set of all possible values of a variable with certain constraints as a Mannigfaltigkeit, because the variable can have many values. He distinguishes between stetige Mannigfaltigkeit and diskrete Mannigfaltigkeit (continuous manifoldness and discontinuous manifoldness), depending on whether the value changes continuously or not. As continuous examples, Riemann refers to not only colors and the locations of objects in space, but also the possible shapes of a spatial figure. Using induction, Riemann constructs an n-fach ausgedehnte Mannigfaltigkeit (n times extended manifoldness or n-dimensional manifoldness) as a continuous stack of (n‚àí1) dimensional manifoldnesses. Riemann's intuitive notion of a Mannigfaltigkeit evolved into what is today formalized as a manifold. Riemannian manifolds and Riemann surfaces are named after Riemann. = Poincar√©'s definition = In his very influential paper, Analysis Situs, Henri Poincar√© gave a definition of a (differentiable) manifold (vari√©t√©) which served as a precursor to the modern concept of a manifold.; translation in Russian Math. Surveys 53 (1998), no. 1, 229‚Äì236 In the first section of Analysis Situs, Poincar√© defines a manifold as the level set of a continuously differentiable function between Euclidean spaces that satisfies the nondegeneracy hypothesis of the implicit function theorem. In the third section, he begins by remarking that the graph of a continuously differentiable function is a manifold in the latter sense. He then proposes a new, more general, definition of manifold based on a 'chain of manifolds' (une cha√Æne des vari√©t√©s). Poincar√©'s notion of a chain of manifolds is a precursor to the modern notion of atlas. In particular, he considers two manifolds defined respectively as graphs of functions \\\\theta(y) and \\\\theta'\\\\left(y'\\\\right) . If these manifolds overlap (a une partie commune), then he requires that the coordinates y depend continuously differentiably on the coordinates y' and vice versa ('...les y sont fonctions analytiques des y' et inversement'). In this way he introduces a precursor to the notion of a chart and of a transition map. It is implicit in Analysis Situs that a manifold obtained as a 'chain' is a subset of Euclidean space. For example, the unit circle in the plane can be thought of as the graph of the function y = \\\\sqrt{1 - x^2} or else the function y = -\\\\sqrt{1 - x^2} in a neighborhood of every point except the points (1, 0) and (‚àí1, 0); and in a neighborhood of those points, it can be thought of as the graph of, respectively, x = \\\\sqrt{1 - y^2} and x = -\\\\sqrt{1 - y^2}. The reason the circle can be represented by a graph in the neighborhood of every point is because the left hand side of its defining equation x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 has nonzero gradient at every point of the circle. By the implicit function theorem, every submanifold of Euclidean space is locally the graph of a function. Hermann Weyl gave an intrinsic definition for differentiable manifolds in his lecture course on Riemann surfaces in 1911‚Äì1912, opening the road to the general concept of a topological space that followed shortly. During the 1930s Hassler Whitney and others clarified the foundational aspects of the subject, and thus intuitions dating back to the latter half of the 19th century became precise, and developed through differential geometry and Lie group theory. Notably, the Whitney embedding theorem showed that the intrinsic definition in terms of charts was equivalent to Poincar√©'s definition in terms of subsets of Euclidean space. = Topology of manifolds: highlights = Two-dimensional manifolds, also known as a 2D surfaces embedded in our common 3D space, were considered by Riemann under the guise of Riemann surfaces, and rigorously classified in the beginning of the 20th century by Poul Heegaard and Max Dehn. Henri Poincar√© pioneered the study of three-dimensional manifolds and raised a fundamental question about them, today known as the Poincar√© conjecture. After nearly a century of effort by many mathematicians, starting with Poincar√© himself, Grigori Perelman proved the Poincar√© conjecture (see the Solution of the Poincar√© conjecture). William Thurston's geometrization program, formulated in the 1970s, provided a far- reaching extension of the Poincar√© conjecture to the general three-dimensional manifolds. Four-dimensional manifolds were brought to the forefront of mathematical research in the 1980s by Michael Freedman and in a different setting, by Simon Donaldson, who was motivated by the then recent progress in theoretical physics (Yang‚ÄìMills theory), where they serve as a substitute for ordinary 'flat' spacetime. Andrey Markov Jr. showed in 1960 that no algorithm exists for classifying four-dimensional manifolds. Important work on higher- dimensional manifolds, including analogues of the Poincar√© conjecture, had been done earlier by Ren√© Thom, John Milnor, Stephen Smale and Sergei Novikov. One of the most pervasive and flexible techniques underlying much work on the topology of manifolds is Morse theory.  Additional structure  = Topological manifolds = The simplest kind of manifold to define is the topological manifold, which looks locally like some \\"ordinary\\" Euclidean space Rn. By definition, all manifolds are topological manifolds, so the phrase \\"topological manifold\\" is usually used to emphasize that a manifold lacks additional structure, or that only its topological properties are being considered. Formally, a topological manifold is a topological space locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space. This means that every point has a neighbourhood for which there exists a homeomorphism (a bijective continuous function whose inverse is also continuous) mapping that neighbourhood to Rn. These homeomorphisms are the charts of the manifold. A topological manifold looks locally like a Euclidean space in a rather weak manner: while for each individual chart it is possible to distinguish differentiable functions or measure distances and angles, merely by virtue of being a topological manifold a space does not have any particular and consistent choice of such concepts. In order to discuss such properties for a manifold, one needs to specify further structure and consider differentiable manifolds and Riemannian manifolds discussed below. In particular, the same underlying topological manifold can have several mutually incompatible classes of differentiable functions and an infinite number of ways to specify distances and angles. Usually additional technical assumptions on the topological space are made to exclude pathological cases. It is customary to require that the space be Hausdorff and second countable. The dimension of the manifold at a certain point is the dimension of the Euclidean space that the charts at that point map to (number n in the definition). All points in a connected manifold have the same dimension. Some authors require that all charts of a topological manifold map to Euclidean spaces of same dimension. In that case every topological manifold has a topological invariant, its dimension. Other authors allow disjoint unions of topological manifolds with differing dimensions to be called manifolds. = Differentiable manifolds = For most applications a special kind of topological manifold, namely a differentiable manifold, is used. If the local charts on a manifold are compatible in a certain sense, one can define directions, tangent spaces, and differentiable functions on that manifold. In particular it is possible to use calculus on a differentiable manifold. Each point of an n-dimensional differentiable manifold has a tangent space. This is an n-dimensional Euclidean space consisting of the tangent vectors of the curves through the point. Two important classes of differentiable manifolds are smooth and analytic manifolds. For smooth manifolds the transition maps are smooth, that is infinitely differentiable. Analytic manifolds are smooth manifolds with the additional condition that the transition maps are analytic (they can be expressed as power series). The sphere can be given analytic structure, as can most familiar curves and surfaces. There are also topological manifolds, i.e., locally Euclidean spaces, which possess no differentiable structures at all. A rectifiable set generalizes the idea of a piecewise smooth or rectifiable curve to higher dimensions; however, rectifiable sets are not in general manifolds. = Riemannian manifolds = To measure distances and angles on manifolds, the manifold must be Riemannian. A Riemannian manifold is a differentiable manifold in which each tangent space is equipped with an inner product in a manner which varies smoothly from point to point. Given two tangent vectors and , the inner product gives a real number. The dot (or scalar) product is a typical example of an inner product. This allows one to define various notions such as length, angles, areas (or volumes), curvature and divergence of vector fields. All differentiable manifolds (of constant dimension) can be given the structure of a Riemannian manifold. The Euclidean space itself carries a natural structure of Riemannian manifold (the tangent spaces are naturally identified with the Euclidean space itself and carry the standard scalar product of the space). Many familiar curves and surfaces, including for example all -spheres, are specified as subspaces of a Euclidean space and inherit a metric from their embedding in it. = Finsler manifolds = A Finsler manifold allows the definition of distance but does not require the concept of angle; it is an analytic manifold in which each tangent space is equipped with a norm, ¬∑, in a manner which varies smoothly from point to point. This norm can be extended to a metric, defining the length of a curve; but it cannot in general be used to define an inner product. Any Riemannian manifold is a Finsler manifold. = Lie groups = Lie groups, named after Sophus Lie, are differentiable manifolds that carry also the structure of a group which is such that the group operations are defined by smooth maps. A Euclidean vector space with the group operation of vector addition is an example of a non-compact Lie group. A simple example of a compact Lie group is the circle: the group operation is simply rotation. This group, known as U(1), can be also characterised as the group of complex numbers of modulus 1 with multiplication as the group operation. Other examples of Lie groups include special groups of matrices, which are all subgroups of the general linear group, the group of n by n matrices with non-zero determinant. If the matrix entries are real numbers, this will be an n2-dimensional disconnected manifold. The orthogonal groups, the symmetry groups of the sphere and hyperspheres, are n(n‚àí1)/2 dimensional manifolds, where n‚àí1 is the dimension of the sphere. Further examples can be found in the table of Lie groups. = Other types of manifolds = * A complex manifold is a manifold whose charts take values in \\\\Complex^n and whose transition functions are holomorphic on the overlaps. These manifolds are the basic objects of study in complex geometry. A one-complex-dimensional manifold is called a Riemann surface. An n-dimensional complex manifold has dimension 2n as a real differentiable manifold. * A CR manifold is a manifold modeled on boundaries of domains in \\\\Complex^n. * 'Infinite dimensional manifolds': to allow for infinite dimensions, one may consider Banach manifolds which are locally homeomorphic to Banach spaces. Similarly, Fr√©chet manifolds are locally homeomorphic to Fr√©chet spaces. * A symplectic manifold is a kind of manifold which is used to represent the phase spaces in classical mechanics. They are endowed with a 2-form that defines the Poisson bracket. A closely related type of manifold is a contact manifold. * A combinatorial manifold is a kind of manifold which is discretization of a manifold. It usually means a piecewise linear manifold made by simplicial complexes. * A digital manifold is a special kind of combinatorial manifold which is defined in digital space. See digital topology  Classification and invariants  Different notions of manifolds have different notions of classification and invariant; in this section we focus on smooth closed manifolds. The classification of smooth closed manifolds is well understood in principle, except in dimension 4: in low dimensions (2 and 3) it is geometric, via the uniformization theorem and the solution of the Poincar√© conjecture, and in high dimension (5 and above) it is algebraic, via surgery theory. This is a classification in principle: the general question of whether two smooth manifolds are diffeomorphic is not computable in general. Further, specific computations remain difficult, and there are many open questions. Orientable surfaces can be visualized, and their diffeomorphism classes enumerated, by genus. Given two orientable surfaces, one can determine if they are diffeomorphic by computing their respective genera and comparing: they are diffeomorphic if and only if the genera are equal, so the genus forms a complete set of invariants. This is much harder in higher dimensions: higher- dimensional manifolds cannot be directly visualized (though visual intuition is useful in understanding them), nor can their diffeomorphism classes be enumerated, nor can one in general determine if two different descriptions of a higher-dimensional manifold refer to the same object. However, one can determine if two manifolds are different if there is some intrinsic characteristic that differentiates them. Such criteria are commonly referred to as invariants, because, while they may be defined in terms of some presentation (such as the genus in terms of a triangulation), they are the same relative to all possible descriptions of a particular manifold: they are invariant under different descriptions. Naively, one could hope to develop an arsenal of invariant criteria that would definitively classify all manifolds up to isomorphism. Unfortunately, it is known that for manifolds of dimension 4 and higher, no program exists that can decide whether two manifolds are diffeomorphic. Smooth manifolds have a rich set of invariants, coming from point-set topology, classic algebraic topology, and geometric topology. The most familiar invariants, which are visible for surfaces, are orientability (a normal invariant, also detected by homology) and genus (a homological invariant). Smooth closed manifolds have no local invariants (other than dimension), though geometric manifolds have local invariants, notably the curvature of a Riemannian manifold and the torsion of a manifold equipped with an affine connection. This distinction between local invariants and no local invariants is a common way to distinguish between geometry and topology. All invariants of a smooth closed manifold are thus global. Algebraic topology is a source of a number of important global invariant properties. Some key criteria include the simply connected property and orientability (see below). Indeed, several branches of mathematics, such as homology and homotopy theory, and the theory of characteristic classes were founded in order to study invariant properties of manifolds. Surfaces = Orientability = In dimensions two and higher, a simple but important invariant criterion is the question of whether a manifold admits a meaningful orientation. Consider a topological manifold with charts mapping to Rn. Given an ordered basis for Rn, a chart causes its piece of the manifold to itself acquire a sense of ordering, which in 3-dimensions can be viewed as either right-handed or left- handed. Overlapping charts are not required to agree in their sense of ordering, which gives manifolds an important freedom. For some manifolds, like the sphere, charts can be chosen so that overlapping regions agree on their \\"handedness\\"; these are orientable manifolds. For others, this is impossible. The latter possibility is easy to overlook, because any closed surface embedded (without self-intersection) in three-dimensional space is orientable. Some illustrative examples of non-orientable manifolds include: (1) the M√∂bius strip, which is a manifold with boundary, (2) the Klein bottle, which must intersect itself in its 3-space representation, and (3) the real projective plane, which arises naturally in geometry.  M√∂bius strip  M√∂bius strip Begin with an infinite circular cylinder standing vertically, a manifold without boundary. Slice across it high and low to produce two circular boundaries, and the cylindrical strip between them. This is an orientable manifold with boundary, upon which \\"surgery\\" will be performed. Slice the strip open, so that it could unroll to become a rectangle, but keep a grasp on the cut ends. Twist one end 180¬∞, making the inner surface face out, and glue the ends back together seamlessly. This results in a strip with a permanent half-twist: the M√∂bius strip. Its boundary is no longer a pair of circles, but (topologically) a single circle; and what was once its \\"inside\\" has merged with its \\"outside\\", so that it now has only a single side. Similarly to the Klein Bottle below, this two dimensional surface would need to intersect itself in two dimensions, but can easily be constructed in three or more dimensions.  Klein bottle  The Klein bottle immersed in three- dimensional space Take two M√∂bius strips; each has a single loop as a boundary. Straighten out those loops into circles, and let the strips distort into cross-caps. Gluing the circles together will produce a new, closed manifold without boundary, the Klein bottle. Closing the surface does nothing to improve the lack of orientability, it merely removes the boundary. Thus, the Klein bottle is a closed surface with no distinction between inside and outside. In three-dimensional space, a Klein bottle's surface must pass through itself. Building a Klein bottle which is not self-intersecting requires four or more dimensions of space.  Real projective plane  Begin with a sphere centered on the origin. Every line through the origin pierces the sphere in two opposite points called antipodes. Although there is no way to do so physically, it is possible (by considering a quotient space) to mathematically merge each antipode pair into a single point. The closed surface so produced is the real projective plane, yet another non-orientable surface. It has a number of equivalent descriptions and constructions, but this route explains its name: all the points on any given line through the origin project to the same \\"point\\" on this \\"plane\\". = Genus and the Euler characteristic = For two dimensional manifolds a key invariant property is the genus, or the \\"number of handles\\" present in a surface. A torus is a sphere with one handle, a double torus is a sphere with two handles, and so on. Indeed, it is possible to fully characterize compact, two-dimensional manifolds on the basis of genus and orientability. In higher-dimensional manifolds genus is replaced by the notion of Euler characteristic, and more generally Betti numbers and homology and cohomology.  Maps of manifolds  A Morin surface, an immersion used in sphere eversion Just as there are various types of manifolds, there are various types of maps of manifolds. In addition to continuous functions and smooth functions generally, there are maps with special properties. In geometric topology a basic type are embeddings, of which knot theory is a central example, and generalizations such as immersions, submersions, covering spaces, and ramified covering spaces. Basic results include the Whitney embedding theorem and Whitney immersion theorem. In Riemannian geometry, one may ask for maps to preserve the Riemannian metric, leading to notions of isometric embeddings, isometric immersions, and Riemannian submersions; a basic result is the Nash embedding theorem. = Scalar-valued functions = 3D color plot of the spherical harmonics of degree n = 5 A basic example of maps between manifolds are scalar-valued functions on a manifold, :f\\\\colon M \\\\to \\\\mathbf{R} or f\\\\colon M \\\\to \\\\mathbf{C}, sometimes called regular functions or functionals, by analogy with algebraic geometry or linear algebra. These are of interest both in their own right, and to study the underlying manifold. In geometric topology, most commonly studied are Morse functions, which yield handlebody decompositions, while in mathematical analysis, one often studies solution to partial differential equations, an important example of which is harmonic analysis, where one studies harmonic functions: the kernel of the Laplace operator. This leads to such functions as the spherical harmonics, and to heat kernel methods of studying manifolds, such as hearing the shape of a drum and some proofs of the Atiyah‚ÄìSinger index theorem.  Generalizations of manifolds  ;Infinite dimensional manifolds: The definition of a manifold can be generalized by dropping the requirement of finite dimensionality. Thus an infinite dimensional manifold is a topological space locally homeomorphic to a topological vector space over the reals. This omits the point-set axioms, allowing higher cardinalities and non-Hausdorff manifolds; and it omits finite dimension, allowing structures such as Hilbert manifolds to be modeled on Hilbert spaces, Banach manifolds to be modeled on Banach spaces, and Fr√©chet manifolds to be modeled on Fr√©chet spaces. Usually one relaxes one or the other condition: manifolds with the point-set axioms are studied in general topology, while infinite-dimensional manifolds are studied in functional analysis. ;Orbifolds: An orbifold is a generalization of manifold allowing for certain kinds of \\"singularities\\" in the topology. Roughly speaking, it is a space which locally looks like the quotients of some simple space (e.g. Euclidean space) by the actions of various finite groups. The singularities correspond to fixed points of the group actions, and the actions must be compatible in a certain sense. ;Algebraic varieties and schemes: Non-singular algebraic varieties over the real or complex numbers are manifolds. One generalizes this first by allowing singularities, secondly by allowing different fields, and thirdly by emulating the patching construction of manifolds: just as a manifold is glued together from open subsets of Euclidean space, an algebraic variety is glued together from affine algebraic varieties, which are zero sets of polynomials over algebraically closed fields. Schemes are likewise glued together from affine schemes, which are a generalization of algebraic varieties. Both are related to manifolds, but are constructed algebraically using sheaves instead of atlases. :Because of singular points, a variety is in general not a manifold, though linguistically the French vari√©t√©, German Mannigfaltigkeit and English manifold are largely synonymous. In French an algebraic variety is called une vari√©t√© alg√©brique (an algebraic variety), while a smooth manifold is called une vari√©t√© diff√©rentielle (a differential variety). ;Stratified space: A \\"stratified space\\" is a space that can be divided into pieces (\\"strata\\"), with each stratum a manifold, with the strata fitting together in prescribed ways (formally, a filtration by closed subsets). There are various technical definitions, notably a Whitney stratified space (see Whitney conditions) for smooth manifolds and a topologically stratified space for topological manifolds. Basic examples include manifold with boundary (top dimensional manifold and codimension 1 boundary) and manifold with corners (top dimensional manifold, codimension 1 boundary, codimension 2 corners). Whitney stratified spaces are a broad class of spaces, including algebraic varieties, analytic varieties, semialgebraic sets, and subanalytic sets. ;CW-complexes: A CW complex is a topological space formed by gluing disks of different dimensionality together. In general the resulting space is singular, and hence not a manifold. However, they are of central interest in algebraic topology, especially in homotopy theory, as they are easy to compute with and singularities are not a concern. ;Homology manifolds: A homology manifold is a space that behaves like a manifold from the point of view of homology theory. These are not all manifolds, but (in high dimension) can be analyzed by surgery theory similarly to manifolds, and failure to be a manifold is a local obstruction, as in surgery theory. ;Differential spaces: Let M be a nonempty set. Suppose that some family of real functions on M was chosen. Denote it by C \\\\subseteq \\\\R^M. It is an algebra with respect to the pointwise addition and multiplication. Let M be equipped with the topology induced by C. Suppose also that the following conditions hold. First: for every H \\\\in C^\\\\infty\\\\left(\\\\R^i\\\\right), where i \\\\in \\\\N, and arbitrary f_1, \\\\dots , f_n \\\\in C, the composition H \\\\circ \\\\left(f_1, \\\\dots, f_n\\\\right) \\\\in C. Second: every function, which in every point of M locally coincides with some function from C, also belongs to C. A pair (M, C) for which the above conditions hold, is called a Sikorski differential space.

It is the longest-running professional Equity theatre in the United States.  History  = Concept = In 1933, when the United States was in the middle of the Great Depression, many people could not afford to pay for theater tickets, and many actors had trouble finding employment. A review by Paul Dellinger in the December 17, 2006 issue of The Roanoke Times summarized the situation as follows: > But Broadway was not doing so much swinging during the Depression, when > theaters went dark and actors found themselves out of work. Back in > Porterfield's part of Virginia, farmers were stuck with crops they couldn't > sell. That was when Porterfield came up with his genius of an idea, bringing > actors to Abingdon to barter their performances for farm goods. Beginning with \\"some twenty of his fellow actors\\", Robert Porterfield, founder of the theatre, offered admission by letting the local people pay with food goods, hence the name \\"Barter\\". He said, \\"With vegetables that you cannot sell you can buy a good laugh.\\" The original ticket price for a play was 30 cents, or the equivalent in goods. Referring to the barter concept, an article in Life magazine's July 31, 1939, issue reported, \\"What sounded like the craziest idea in the history of the U.S. theater is now a booming success.\\" Actors were kept very busy, even when they did not have parts in current plays. They contributed to the theatre's overall success by working on scenery, collecting props, directing and working in the cafeteria at the Barter Inn, where members of the troupe boarded. = First production = Barter Theatre's first production was After Tomorrow by John Golden. An Associated Press news story reported that the production \\"was played to a capacity audience that came laden with cakes, fruit, vegetables, poultry\\" and a live pig. =Outreach= While remaining based in Abingdon, Barter Theatre has presented plays over a broad geographical area. In 1949, one of its companies produced Hamlet in Elsinore, Denmark. That same year it had a touring company that did one-night stands in localities in Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina. In 2014 the Barter Theatre and the William King Art Center collaborated to produce an art exhibition by Abingdon artists affiliated with the two institutions. = Facilities = Initially, the theatre's plays were performed in the Abingdon Opera House, and actors stayed at the Martha Washington Inn. In 1935, it moved to the campus of the defunct Stonewall Jackson College for Women. The 1939 article in Life reported that the actors received no pay but were fed well and were housed in the former college's dormitories. The troupe produced plays in the auditorium on the campus. Productions branched out into the surrounding area after three nights on campus, going \\"on a ten-day tour of mountain towns and resorts in an ancient bus widey known as 'Bessie.'\\" The facility in which actors stayed became known as the Barter Inn. Besides housing members of the theatre, the inn offered a limited number of reservations for the public, which provided an opportunity for people to eat with the actors in the inn's cafeteria. In 1950, novelist James Hilton purchased \\"several acres of land adjoining the Barter Theater [sic] ... to protect the view from the Barter Inn\\" after the property had been advertised as being available for building sites. In 1996, a $1.7 million renovation of the building was completed. The depth of the stage was increased from 28 feet to 60 feet. New lighting and sound systems were installed, and the heating and air-conditioning systems were upgraded. The balcony was extended to provide more seats and a better view from that level. Current status  Today, Barter is one of the last year-round professional resident repertory theaters remaining in the United States. The current building, originally Sinking Springs Presbyterian Church built in 1833, is the second-oldest theatrical building in the United States. In 1951, its interior was renovated with fittings from the Empire Theatre in New York. The seats from that renovation were later replaced with seats from the Jefferson Theatre in Falls Church, Virginia, after it closed. Each year, Barter Theatre celebrates its heritage with Barter Days. For these performances, patrons are invited to barter for admission by bringing the equivalent amount of canned food. All food is donated to a local charity.  Directors  Porterfield served as director until his death in 1971. Rex Partington was selected as the next artistic director, serving from 1972 to 1992. Since 1992, Richard Rose has served as the Barter Theatre's third artistic director. The Barter's continued success under their leadership made it the first regional theater \\"to survive the passing of its founder.\\"  Actors  Many well-known stars of stage, screen and television have performed early in their careers at Barter, including Gregory Peck, Ernest Borgnine, Patricia Neal, Ned Beatty, Hume Cronyn, Gary Collins, Frances Fisher, Kevin Spacey, Larry Linville, John Glover, Jim Varney, and Wayne Knight. Will Bigham, the 2007 winner of On The Lot, acted at Barter Theatre for several years.  Facilities  The theatre is located within the Abingdon Historic District. The main theatre (named Gilliam Stage) has 505 seats with 216 of those in the balcony, and Barter Stage II (Named Smith Theatre) has 167.

It was erected from 1065 to 1068 at the behest of King Henry IV of Germany, slighted during the Saxon Rebellion in 1073-75, and a century later rebuilt under Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and his Welf successor Otto IV, who died here in 1218. Later used as a robber baron's lair, the hill castle crumbled into ruins over the centuries. Today it has almost completely disappeared; only fragments of the foundation walls and the towers together with the castle well are preserved. Etymology Mentioned as Hartesburg in a 1071 deed, the name of the castle () is derived from the Harz mountain range, called Hart in Middle Low German, and is probably affiliated with hardt meaning \\"mountain forest\\". Therefore, Harzburg can be translated as \\"Harz Castle\\". Location View from the Gro√üer Burgberg The ruins of the Gro√üe Harzburg are located above the spa town and the Radau valley, on the top of the Gro√üer Burgberg hill at a height of . The summit can be reached by the Burgberg Cable Car and has an outstanding view past the neighbouring summit of Kleiner Burgberg () in the northwest over the northern Harz Foreland with the Harly hill range and far into the North German Plain. Southwards, the view goes over the densely forested mountains of the Harz National Park up to the Brocken massif. The remains of the walls on the Gro√üer Burgberg summit are open to the public. The layout of the castle and its remnants are explained on information boards at the site. It had two different bergfrieds; the square one has been partially rebuilt in modern times (see photo). One interesting feature is the wide moat driven through the rock that separates the castle complex into an east and a west wing, linked by a modern stone bridge. The castle well drew drinking water from the nearby Sachsenbrunnen, an enclosed spring in the woods. In medieval times, the water was transferred over several hundred metres in wooden pipes. The viewpoint on the northern edge of the castle plateau is marked by the high Canossa Column, erected in 1877 during the German Kulturkampf conflict in honour of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck on the 800th anniversary of King Henry's Walk to Canossa. In addition, the former castle grounds comprise the more than two-hundred-year-old Bismarck Elm, a Harz folktales memorial hall erected from 1928 to 1932, a modern statue of the alleged pagan god Krodo, as well as a restaurant. To the north, on the nearby hill of Kleiner Burgberg, are the remains of the so-called Kleine Harzburg (\\"Little Harz Castle\\") outlook, and to the east on the nearby Sachsenberg are the traces of a rampart, possibly constructed by the rebellious Saxons to besiege the Gro√üe Harzburg (see below).

In the 11th century, the Salian emperor Henry III had made the Imperial Palace of Goslar one of his favourite residences. He did, however, arouse the disfavour of the local Saxon nobility and the Billung dukes, not only by his Franconian descendance, but also due to the expensive maintaining of his Imperial court. Henry III died in 1056 at Bodfeld Castle and when his son King Henry IV, came of age in 1065, he soon renewed the Saxon conflict laying claim to several domains around the Harz mountains. =Henry IV= During Henry's minority and the regency of his mother Agnes of Poitou, the Saxon nobles had strengthened their position. The local count Otto of Nordheim, Duke of Bavaria since 1061, had even been involved in Henry's abduction during the 1062 Coup of Kaiserswerth. In turn, the Gro√üe Harzburg (Hartesburg) was erected during a large-scale castle building programme in the Duchy of Saxony from 1065 to 1068. Intended as a demonstration of power in the Saxon mainland, the extended complex was strategically sited by King Henry's architect Bishop Benno II of Osnabr√ºck providing protection for the nearby Goslar imperial palace and the mines of Rammelsberg. Its walls extend right up to the steep face of the conical hilltop. At the time it was built the castle was impregnable. Despite its defensive strength, the castle was also especially palatial. For example, it contained, amongst other things, unusually large, three-roomed great hall and collegiate church, to which Henry had many relics transferred. He even had a sort of family vault built, in which he laid the mortal remains of his brother, Duke Conrad II of Bavaria and his son, Henry, both of whom died young. According to the chronicler Lambert of Hersfeld, the Saxon Rebellion broke out when on 29 June 1073 several nobles marched against the king residing in the Imperial Palace of Goslar. Henry had to flee along with the Imperial Regalia into the walls of the Harzburg. The besieging forces led by Otto of Nordheim and Bishop Burchard II of Halberstadt allegedly numbered 60,000 whilst his garrison only had 300 men. The king finally fled to Franconia in the night to 10 August, according to legend, through the well of the besieged castle and a secret passage. The king initially did not gain much support by the German princes and in the 1074 Treaty of Gerstungen he was forced to agree to slight his castles, including the Harzburg. He hesitated, however, and only had the walls and towers demolished, whilst the buildings themselves remained. But in the spring of 1074 the Harzburg was plundered by annoyed peasants and completely destroyed. The collegiate church was not spared and the royal family tomb was desecrated. This incident prompted widespread indignation and gave Henry cause to advance with all his might against the rebellious Saxons again and so, on 9 June 1075, the rebels were defeated at the Battle of Langensalza. Henry IV never returned to the Harzburg. Pope Gregory VII, who would become a bitter enemy during the Investiture Controversy, imposed a ban on the devastated site. In January 1077, the king had to make the Walk to Canossa to obtain the revocation of his excommunication. =Hohenstaufens and Welfs= The Burgberg hill and Burgberg Cable Car During the conflict of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick I with the Welf duke Henry the Lion, the rebuilding work on the castle continued until 1180. In January 1076 Henry had claimed the enfeoffment with Goslar and the Rammelsberg mines in turn for his support against the rebellious Italian cities of the Lombard League. The duke was deposed in 1180, yet Frederick felt it was necessary to protect Goslar against Henry's forces. The complex was completed by Henry's son Emperor Otto IV, sole King of the Romans upon his rival Philip of Swabia in 1208. He was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Innocent III the next year, however, the two fell out soon after. Banned by the pope, he had to witness the election of the Hohenstaufen scion Frederick II in September 1211. Defeated by King Philip II of France in the 1214 Battle of Bouvines, he retired to his Saxon homelands and died at the Harzburg on 19 May 1218. The fortress lost its immediate function as an imperial castle as Otto's brother Henry of Brunswick had to surrender the Imperial Regalia to the Hohenstaufen dynasty. In 1222 the Harzburg was awarded the title of castrum imperiale again. Relying on the existing imperial enfeoffment of the Harzburg seat, the character of the castle as an imperial fortress remained largely intact up to the time the Hohenstaufen dynasty became extinct and the castle was pledged to the Counts of Wernigerode in 1269. =Later history= Northwestern view of Neustadt Harzburg, 1825 The following centuries were characterized by frequent changes of ownership. About 1370 it was occupied by the Welf duke Otto of Brunswick-G√∂ttingen during the War of the L√ºneburg Succession and entrusted to his ministerialis Hans von Schwicheldt, against fierce protest raised by the Wernigerode counts. In the early 15th century the Harzburg was pledged as a fief to the three sons of Hans von Schwicheldt, who turned it into a robber baron castle and ravaged the surrounding Brunswick, Hildesheim and Halberstadt lands. The importance of the fortress decreased steadily, resulting in its slow decline. A rebuilding of the castle in the 16th century was never carried out due to the high cost. During the Thirty Years' War, the castle changed hands several times, although its garrison remained intact. Since this type of fortification had become insignificant due to the changed nature of warfare, demolition of the remaining elements of the ruin began in 1650. Since then the castle has amounted to little more than its foundation ruins and well. The urban settlement of Neustadt at the foot of the Gro√üer Burgberg adopted the castle's name in 1892.

A sequel to Frankenstein Conquers the World, the film was a Japanese-American co-production; it was the third and final collaboration between Toho and Henry G. Saperstein. The film stars Russ Tamblyn, Kumi Mizuno, Kenji Sahara, with Y√ª Sekida as Sanda and Haruo Nakajima as Gaira. In the film, scientists investigate the sudden appearance of two giant hairy humanoid monsters that culminates into a battle in Tokyo. The War of the Gargantuas was theatrically released in Japan on July 31, 1966. Followed by a theatrical release in the United States on July 29, 1970, on a double-bill with Monster Zero. Since its release, the film has been regarded as a cult classic, drawing admiration from artists such as Brad Pitt, Quentin Tarantino, Guillermo del Toro, and Tim Burton. Plot During a rainy night, a fishing boat is attacked by a giant octopus. The octopus is then attacked by a giant, green-haired humanoid monster. After defeating the octopus, the green monster then attacks the boat. A survivor is recovered, who reveals to doctors and police that Frankenstein attacked his boat and ate the crew. The press picks up the story and interviews Dr. Paul Stewart and his assistant, Dr. Akemi Togawa, who once had a baby Frankenstein in their possession for study five years prior. Stewart and Akemi dispel the idea that the attack was caused by their Frankenstein, postulating that his Frankenstein was gentle, would not attack nor eat people, nor would he live in the ocean as he was found in the mountains and likely died after he escaped. Another boat is attacked and villagers see the green Frankenstein off the coast at the same time that a mountain guide reports seeing Frankenstein in the Japanese Alps. Stewart and Akemi investigate the mountains and find giant footprints in the snow. Their colleague, Dr. Majida, collects tissue samples from the second boat. The green Frankenstein attacks Haneda Airport, eats a woman, and returns to the sea after the clouds clear. Stewart and Akemi leave for Tokyo for a meeting with the military to discuss plans to kill the monster. Majida deduces that the green Frankenstein is sensitive to light. The green Frankenstein briefly appears in Tokyo, but is driven away by bright lights. It retreats to the mountains, where the military counterattacks it. Then, a second Frankenstein, brown-haired in appearance, appears and comes to the green Frankenstein's aide, helping it escape. Stewart and Akemi conclude that the brown Frankenstein is their former subject. To distinguish the monsters, the military designate the green and brown Frankensteins as Gaira and Sanda, respectively. After collecting and examining tissue samples from both monsters, Stewart concludes that Gaira is Sanda's clone. He theorizes that a piece of Sanda's tissue made its way out to sea, where it survived off plankton and evolved into Gaira. During a hiking trip, Stewart, Akemi, and several hikers run away from Gaira. Akemi falls off a ledge, but Sanda saves her in time, injuring his leg in the process. Stewart and Akemi try to convince the military that only Gaira should be killed while Sanda should be spared, but the army ignores their pleas, unwilling to risk letting either monster live. After discovering that Gaira devoured people, Sanda attacks him. Gaira escapes with Sanda pursuing and heads towards Tokyo, no longer deterred by the city lights as they alert him to the presence of food. During the evacuation, Akemi vows to save Sanda, but runs into Gaira instead. Sanda stops Gaira from devouring Akemi and Stewart carries her to safety. Sanda tries to plead with Gaira, but the green monster engages Sanda in battle. Stewart tries to convince the military to give Sanda time to defeat Gaira, but fails. However, the military aids Sanda as his battle with Gaira moves from Tokyo to Tokyo Bay and further out to sea. As the military drops bombs around the battling Frankensteins, an underwater volcano suddenly erupts, swallowing both monsters. Majida informs Stewart and Akemi that the monsters' deaths could not be confirmed due to the intense heat, but stresses that nothing could have survived the eruption.  Cast  Production The War of the Gargantuas was the third and final co-production collaboration between Toho and Henry G. Saperstein's UPA. Towards the end of 1965, Toho informed director Ishir≈ç Honda that his director's contract would not be renewed and Iwao Mori told him that he would need to speak with producer Tomoyuki Tanaka about each assignment. Seiji Tani, Honda's new chief assistant, spoke about actor Russ Tamblyn and Honda not agreeing on set, with Tamblyn often doing the exact opposite of what Honda instructed, Tani stated: \\"Honda-san had to hold back and bear so much during that one. [Russ Tamblyn] was such an asshole\\" Tamblyn felt his lines in the film were so bad that he improvised them all. It was co-producer Saperstein's choice to replace Nick Adams with Tamblyn, later stating, \\"Tamblyn was a royal pain in the ass\\". The film was originally announced as The Frankenstein Brothers, then The Two Frankensteins, Frankenstein vs. Frankenstein, Frankenstein's Decisive Battle, and Frankenstein's Fight during script writing processes. The film was originally intended as a sequel to Frankenstein Conquers the World, with Honda biographers Ryfle and Godziszewski noting that the continuity between the two films was \\"somewhat fuzzy\\". The film was created quickly, with writer Kimura's final draft on the screenplay being dated 23 April 1966. Honda shot the film's dramatic footage between May 9 and June 4 with Tsuburaya's special effects crew finishing in mid-July. The American version had Honda shoot additional scenes and UPA had Toho release the negatives, outtakes and other footage such as sound and music elements. Tab Hunter was originally cast as Dr. Stewart, but was replaced by Tamblyn during pre-production. English versions Toho commissioned an English dub from Frontier Enterprises, a Tokyo-based company, for international territories. Referred to as the \\"international dub\\", this version is a direct translation of the Japanese version, keeping references to the monsters as Frankensteins and having Tamblyn's English dialogue dubbed over by another actor. Toho's international dub remained unreleased until late 2017, when the film and other Godzilla titles appeared on Starz's streaming service after Janus Films and The Criterion Collection obtained the rights to the films. Co- producer Henry G. Saperstein commissioned a separate English dub from Glen Glenn Sound, a Los Angeles-based company, for the film's American release. This version omits all references to Frankenstein Conquers the World, with the creatures being referred to as \\"Gargantuas\\" instead of \\"Frankensteins\\" or by their names. This version also includes additional footage not featured in the Japanese version, making the American version run at 92 minutes. Tamblyn's original dialogue soundtrack was lost during production and was called back to re-dub his lines. Tamblyn worked without a script and had to rely on improvising his lines based on the footage's lip movement due to being unable to remember his original lines. Release =Theatrical= The film was released theatrically in Japan on July 31, 1966 by Toho. The Glen Glenn Sound English dub received a theatrical release in the United States by Maron Films as The War of the Gargantuas on July 29, 1970, where it was released as a double feature with Monster Zero, which was also dubbed by Glen Glenn Sound. In the United Kingdom, the film was titled Duel of the Gargantuas. The War of the Gargantuas and Monster Zero were intended to be released earlier; however, distributors did not think that either film had potential until 1970, when Saperstein made a deal with Maron Films. =Home media= In 2008, Classic Media released a 2-disc DVD of the film as a double feature with Rodan. Both films included their original Japanese version and American English versions, with Rodan presented in its native full-screen scope and The War of the Gargantuas in its original widescreen ratio. This release also features the documentary Bringing Godzilla Down to Size, detailing the history of the genre and tokusatsu techniques of the genre. In 2010, Toho released the film on Blu- ray which includes special features such as an audio commentary by Kumi Mizuno, outtakes, trailers, and behind the scenes photo galleries. In 2017, Janus Films and The Criterion Collection acquired the Frontier Enterprises English dub of the film, as well as other Godzilla titles, to stream on Starz and FilmStruck. The Frontier dub was made available on HBO Max upon its launch. Legacy American actor Brad Pitt had cited The War of the Gargantuas as the film that inspired him to pursue acting. The film inspired parts of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill: Volume 2, such as a miniature shot of Tokyo made specifically for the film and the fight scene between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah, which Tarantino dubbed \\"War of the Blonde Gargantuas\\". Tarantino had screened the film for Hannah and Hannah's character uses the word \\"gargantuan\\" several times. In an episode of Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated titled \\"Battle of the Humungonauts\\", the episode parodies the film by featuring two hairy creatures similar in appearance to Sanda and Gaira, riffing the film's title, and even featuring a cover of Kipp Hamilton's \\"The Words Get Stuck in My Throat\\". American film director Tim Burton noted the film was a favorite of his and his daughter's. Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro cited The War of the Gargantuas and its predecessor Frankenstein Conquers the World as two of his top five favorite kaiju filmsPacific Rim's Guillermo del Toro on Remaking Classic Japanese Monster Movies and cited The War of the Gargantuas as an influence on the opening for Pacific Rim. The American band Devo performed a live version of \\"The Words Get Stuck in My Throat\\" in 1978. In August 2019, Michael Dougherty, director and co-writer of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, expressed interest in rebooting and adapting the Gargantuas for the MonsterVerse.

Founded in 1957, it grants both undergraduate and graduate degrees, and is one of the university's nine constituent schools. Since 1998, the school has been named in honor of Georgetown alumnus Robert Emmett McDonough. History The school was founded in 1957 as an outgrowth of the School of Foreign Service, and was originally named the Georgetown University School of Business Administration. In 1993, the name was changed to the Georgetown University School of Business. On October 7, 1998, the School of Business was renamed the Robert Emmett McDonough School of Business in honor of alumnus Robert Emmett McDonough (a 1949 graduate of the School of Foreign Service) in honor of his $30 million donation to the school. =The Rafik B. Hariri Building= In 2009 the McDonough School of Business moved into the newly constructed Rafik B. Hariri Building, named after the late Rafik Hariri, former Prime Minister of Lebanon and father of Georgetown alumnus Saad Hariri, also a former Prime Minister of Lebanon. The $82.5-million privately funded building opened in the summer of 2009. The new building includes 15 classrooms, eight case-style rooms, five tiered lecture rooms, and two flat-floor rooms; 34 breakout rooms complete with data ports, flat-screen video monitors, and white boards; separate undergraduate and graduate commons areas and lockers for graduate students; 120 faculty offices; 11 interview rooms within the Career Management Office; 15 conference rooms throughout the building; and a 400-seat auditorium, among other features. Academics Several academic themes distinguish the McDonough School of Business and give the school a special identity among managers and academicians, including international and intercultural dimensions of the marketplace, the importance of written and oral communication, and interpersonal effectiveness in organizations. As a Catholic and Jesuit university, Georgetown stresses ethics and social justice in its curriculum. The Georgetown Institute for Consumer Research is one of several academic research centers at the McDonough School of Business. The McDonough School of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Undergraduate school The Rafik B. Hariri Building opened in 2009. Undergraduates work toward a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA). The curriculum combines business and liberal arts courses to provide a strong foundation in critical thinking and reasoning. The primary academic emphasis during the first and second years is the liberal arts, notably economics, government, history, philosophy, English, calculus, and theology. Coursework usually shifts to mostly business courses in the junior and senior years, but this can vary depending on how a student constructs his or her schedule. Students must complete both 40 courses and 120 semester hours of liberal arts courses, business core courses, courses supporting a major or minor, and free electives. The McDonough School of Business has core courses in the traditional disciplines of accounting, finance, marketing, management, and the decision sciences support these themes. Additionally these themes are supported by the school's strong support of minor concentrations among nearly 50 liberal arts disciplines. About one third of undergraduates choose to double major. Undergraduate concentrations include accounting, finance, two separate majors related to international business, management, marketing, and operations and information management (OPIM). The McDonough School's undergraduate acceptance rate in the 2009-2010 cycle (for the class of 2014) was 22 percent, but this dropped to 15.7 percent for the 2014-2015 cycle (class of 2019), where the school accepted 530 applicants out of roughly 3,375 applicants. In the 2013-2014 admission cycle (for the class of 2018), the 25th and 75th percentiles of the admitted students' SAT scores were 650 and 750 for Critical Reading, and 690 and 770 for Mathematics, respectively. =Career placement= The largest employers of new McDonough School of Business alumni include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, Barclays Capital, Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Deloitte, Bank of America, IBM, and Citigroup. Students also pursue professional degrees, such as Juris Doctor, immediately after graduating. =Student groups, activities, and employment= The Undergraduate Program Office and active students provide dozens of activities and groups. Some well-known activities include the Georgetown University Student Investment Fund, Georgetown University Accounting Society, Innovo Consulting, Hilltop Consultants, Alpha Kappa Psi Professional Business Fraternity, Young Alumni Mentor Program, Stock Pitch Competition, and several other activities. Students work for a variety of skill-based jobs on campus, such as in accounting or finance department of student groups and companies (such as The Corp, The Hoya, and the Georgetown University Alumni & Student Federal Credit Union), the University Investment Office, the MSB Tech Center, and University Information Services. Many students also have internships in the Washington, DC area, usually about 8‚Äì12 hours per week, at private equity, investment management, and accounting firms, or other companies including startups. Given the school‚Äôs D.C. location, students also have the opportunity to intern with government agencies. The school also offers six-week summer study-abroad programs tailored specifically for business students at the University of Oxford, Sophia University in Tokyo, and the ESADE Business School. Graduate school Graduate work offered by the school includes a day and evening Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs, two Global Executive MBA programs (one weekend format and one modular), a Master of Science in Finance (MSF) program, a Master of Science in Management and an Executive Master's in Leadership degree. =MBA Full-Time program= The Georgetown MBA Full-time Program is a general management program oriented toward those with liberal arts, science, or technical undergraduate degrees. Students who enroll in the 60-credit program typically are mid-level managers with an average of five years of work experience. During the course of the 21-month program, students are required to participate in four one-week residences, of which one is international. Joint degrees are offered combining the MBA with JD, MD, Masters in Public Policy, or Masters of Science in Foreign Service. For the class of 2019, 34% of enrolled students are of international origin and 77% have lived, worked, or studied abroad. The fields most represented by applicants were finance, consulting, and technology, respectively. There were 1,742 applicants and 276 were enrolled. The MBA Full-time Program has often been ranked among the top 25 business programs by many leading publications, including BusinessWeek, USNews, Financial Times, and many others. =MBA Evening Program= The MBA Evening Program (EP) is designed for the working professional. The 60-credit program is taught by the same faculty as the MBA Full-Time Program and covers the same academic content in three years. In its 2015 ranking, Bloomberg BusinessWeek ranked the MBA Evening Program #4 in the nation. =Master of Science in Finance: Full-Time and Part-Time Program= The \\"Master of Science in Finance\\" graduate program is technology-intensive, with a duration of 21-months, requisites of 32-34 credits and is accredited by the Advanced Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The program is intended to prepare the next global leaders of finance, via challenging quantitative academic coursework, a required graduation GPA of at least a 3.0, an on-campus residency, an optional 2- month summer consulting and/or investment clinic, as well as a mandatory global consulting project. One of the past locations for the global consulting project has been Johannesburg, South Africa. In the past, firms such as Barclays, Deloitte, Blink Consulting, Standard Chartered, Coca-Cola and the World Bank, have partnered with the program to offer consulting project opportunities to students. Program coursework encompasses Corporate Finance, Financial Markets, Econometrics, Real Estate Private Equity, Big and Small Data, Fixed Income Investments, Advanced Valuation and Modeling, Financial Statement Analysis, as well as Options Pricing and Risk Management. =Executive Programs= Georgetown's McDonough School of Business offers Executive MBA programs that are characterized by small class sizes and cohort relationships. The Global Executive MBA program (previously the International Executive MBA program - IEMBA) provides experienced professionals with the tools needed to excel in today's global business environment by combining classroom teaching with international residencies. The every-alternate-weekend class structure means students can stay on the job, immediately putting their new knowledge to work. The Georgetown-ESADE Global Executive MBA for highly accomplished managers and executives is offered in partnership with the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and the ESADE Business School in Spain. The program consists of six 11-day modules in Washington, D.C., Barcelona, S√£o Paulo, Buenos Aires, Bangalore, Moscow, and New York. The Executive Master's in Leadership degree is a distinctive, 13-month program that emphasizes leadership in organizations with a focus on identifying and developing the leadership capabilities of individuals. The master's program analyzes leadership as a set of skills on three different levels of analysis: individual, interpersonal, and institutional. Alumni Georgetown's McDonough School of Business claims more than 10,500 undergraduate alumni and approximately 5,000 MBA and several hundred Executive MBA alumni.

They are found throughout the world's tropical, sub- tropical and temperate oceans, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Irish Sea. Anatomy The family Polychelidae is notable for the number of chelate (clawed) limbs, with either four or all five pairs of pereiopods bearing claws. This gives rise to the scientific names Polycheles (many-clawed) and Pentacheles (five claws). The first pair of periopods are greatly elongated, but often become broken off while specimens are being brought to the surface. The rostrum is very short or absent, and, although eyestalks are present, the eyes are absent. This family can be seen as evidence of the transition from shrimp-like animals to lobster-like animals, since they possess a number of primitive characters (plesiomorphies), such as the pointed telson, in contrast to the rounded telson in lobsters. Discovery Although apparently widespread, and at least locally common, they were first discovered only in the late nineteenth century when they were dredged up by the Challenger expedition from a depth supposed to be \\"barren, if not of all life, certainly of animals so high in the scale of existence\\" (Charles Spence Bate). Their kinship with the fossil group Eryonoidea, including well-known genera such as Eryon, was immediately recognised. Since Eryon and its relatives were only known from fossils, lastly in the Jurassic, this made the Polychelidae something of a living fossil. The reason that polychelids remained unknown for so long is that they live on the sea-floor, often at great depths; the family as a whole has a depth range from less than to over . This also accounts for the lack of eyesight, since almost none of the sun's light penetrates to such abyssal depths. Fossil record A single fossil species is known, Antarcticheles antarcticus, which was found in Jurassic sediments on James Ross Island, close to the Prince Gustav Channel. Larvae The larvae of polychelids are very distinctive, and were first described under the name Eryoneicus. Over forty different larval forms are known, although few can be ascribed to known adult species.

In his 26 years at the county Sandham formed a formidable opening partnership with Jack Hobbs, and the two put on a hundred for the first wicket on 66 occasions, the highest of these the 428 they accumulated against Oxford University in 1926. He passed 2,000 runs in eight seasons, and during the middle part of his career between 1924 and 1931 averaged above 50 in all but two years. He scored an unbeaten 292 against Northants, being denied his triple century only by Percy Fender's declaration, and still holds three record Surrey partnerships, including the 173 he put on with Andy Ducat for the 10th wicket at Leyton after suffering a bout of food poisoning. Sandham made his England debut in 1921 against Australia, inching his way to 21 in 81 minutes before being bowled by a 'snorter' from Ted McDonald. He went to South Africa in 1922‚Äì23 but made only one half-century in his nine innings, and though he was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1923, he again failed to make much of an impression either against the South Africans in 1924 or in Australia the following winter. In 1924 Herbert Sutcliffe made his Test debut, and his success as Hobbs' opening partner restricted Sandham's opportunities subsequently. He played only five innings against Australia during his career and thought that the greatest regret of his career. Sandham went to South Africa in 1926‚Äì27 and scored heavily in the matches against domestic opposition, averaging above 60, but was not picked for any of the Tests. However, he did play in the Caribbean series in 1929‚Äì30, and it was here that he achieved his greatest fame. In the first Test at Bridgetown he made 152 and 51. In the next two games he failed completely, making 0 and 5 at Port of Spain and then 9 and 0 at Georgetown. In the fourth and final Test at Kingston, however, he became the first Test triple-centurion when he compiled a mammoth 325 out of England's equally imposing total of 849, beating R. E. Foster's individual Test score record of 287, which had stood for twenty-seven years. The theoretically timeless match was in fact abandoned as a draw after nine days, but Sandham had still had time to make 50 in the second innings; he had scored 592 runs in the series. His aggregate of 375 in the match stood as the Test record until Greg Chappell eclipsed it. He made the runs with a long- handled bat borrowed from his captain Freddie Calthorpe and a pair of ill- fitting boots borrowed from Patsy Hendren. At 39 years and 272 days, he is, by almost five years, the oldest player to break the individual scoring record in Tests. Andy Sandham's career performance graph. Sandham went to South Africa with MCC in 1930/31. He broke a bone in his ankle in a motor accident in Durban in December. It required a small operation and ended his tour after two first-class matches. The Kingston Test was therefore to be Sandham's final match at Test level, and his 325 is by some distance the highest score in a final Test match. He continued to appear regularly for Surrey for a number of years, scoring 219 against the touring Australians in 1934, a record for a county player against that opposition. He recorded his hundredth first-class hundred in 1935 on a damp pitch at Basingstoke, reaching the milestone with 'a flick behind square'. He made 239 against Glamorgan as late as June 1937, only a month short of his 47th birthday. He scored 102 in his final match in England, against Sussex at Hove, but had an unusual end to his career, playing three games at Buenos Aires for Sir TEW Brinkman's XI against Argentina in 1937‚Äì38. These matches were designated as first-class, and so he ended with a whimper, not reaching 30 in any of his six innings in South America. After the war, Sandham returned to Surrey as coach and delighted in the county's seven successive County Championship titles in the 1950s, later becoming the club's scorer. He died in 1982 in Westminster, London. He was a Catholic.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/107349187 References External links * Category:1890 births Category:1982 deaths Category:English cricket coaches Category:Cricket scorers Category:England Test cricketers Category:English cricketers Category:London Counties cricketers Category:Surrey cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 Category:H.

Signs and symptoms The disease presents with the widespread formation of fluid-filled blisters that are thin walled and easily ruptured, and the patient can be positive for Nikolsky's sign. Ritter's disease of the newborn is the most severe form of SSSS, with similar signs and symptoms. SSSS often includes a widespread painful erythroderma, often involving the face, diaper, and other intertriginous areas. Extensive areas of desquamation might be present. Perioral crusting and fissuring are seen early in the course. Unlike toxic epidermal necrolysis, SSSS spares the mucous membranes. It is most common in children under 6 years, but can be seen in adults who are immunosuppressed or have kidney failure. Pathophysiology The syndrome is induced by epidermolytic exotoxins (exfoliatin) A and B, which are released by S. aureus and cause detachment within the epidermal layer, by breaking down the desmosomes. One of the exotoxins is encoded on the bacterial chromosome, while the other is encoded on a plasmid. These exotoxins are proteases that cleave desmoglein-1, which normally holds the granulosum and spinosum layers together, similar to the pathophysiology of the autoimmune skin disease, pemphigus vulgaris. Diagnosis SSSS is a clinical diagnosis. This is sometimes confirmed by isolation of S. aureus from blood, mucous membranes, or skin biopsy; however, these are often negative. Skin biopsy may show separation of the superficial layer of the epidermis (intraepidermal separation), differentiating SSSS from TEN, wherein the separation occurs at the dermo-epidermal junction (subepidermal separation). SSSS may be difficult to distinguish from toxic epidermal necrolysis and pustular psoriasis. Treatment The mainstay of treatment for SSSS is supportive care along with eradication of the primary infection. Conservative measures include rehydration, antipyretics (e.g., ibuprofen or paracetamol), management of thermal burns, and stabilization. Parenteral antibiotics to cover S. aureus should be administered. Most strains of S. aureus implicated in SSSS have penicillinases, so are penicillin resistant. Therefore, treatment with nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin is typically indicated. Clindamycin is sometimes also used because of its inhibition of exotoxins. Prognosis The prognosis of SSSS in children is excellent, with complete resolution within 10 days of treatment, and without significant scarring. However, SSSS must be differentiated carefully from toxic epidermal necrolysis, which carries a poor prognosis. The prognosis in adults is generally much worse, and depends upon various factors such as time to treatment, host immunity, and comorbidities. History The clinical features were first described in 1878 by Baron Gottfried Ritter von Rittershain, who observed 297 cases among children in a single Czechoslovakian children's home over a 10-year period. In 1885, Nil Filatow, and in 1894, Clement Dukes, described an exantematous disease which they thought to be a form of rubella, but in 1900, Dukes identified it to be a separate entity which came to be known by the names Dukes' disease, Filatov‚Äôs disease, or fourth disease. Although Dukes identified it as a separate entity, it is thought not to be different from scarlet fever caused by staphylococcal exotoxin after Keith Powell proposed equating it with the condition currently known as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in 1979.

It was a principal dogma of the Hussites and one of the Four Articles of Prague. After the Hussite movement split into various factions early in the Hussite Wars, Hussites that emphasized the laity's right to communion under both kinds became known as Moderate Hussites, Utraquist Hussites, or simply Utraquists. The Utraquists were the largest major Hussite faction. Following the victory of allied Utraquist and Catholic forces in the Hussite Wars, Utraquists constituted a majority of the Bohemian population until the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, nearly two centuries later. The Battle of White Mountain, in 1620, marked the end of the Bohemian Revolt and, consequently, the end of almost two hundred years of Utraquist predominance.  History  K≈ô√≠≈æky: Sub Utraque (1916), by Alphonse Mucha, The Slav Epic Utraquism was a Christian dogma first proposed by Jacob of Mies, professor of philosophy at the University of Prague, in 1414. It maintained that the Eucharist should be administered \\"in both kinds\\" ‚Äì as both bread and wine ‚Äì to all the congregation, including the laity. The practice among Roman Catholics at the time was for only the priests to partake of the consecrated wine, the Precious Blood. The Utraquists were a moderate faction of the Hussites (in contrast to the more radical Taborites, Orebites and Orphans). They were also known as the Prague Party or the Calixtines ‚Äì from calix, Latin for their emblem, the chalice. The Utraquists eventually reunited with the Holy See and defeated the more radical Taborites and Orphans at the Battle of Lipany in 1434. After that battle, nearly all forms of Hussite revival were Utraquist, as seen with George of Podƒõbrady, who even managed to cause the city of T√°bor, the famous Taborite stronghold, to convert to Utraquism.

Life He was born at Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port (Lower Navarre) toward the end of 1529 or beginning of 1530, and was educated, first, at the university of Huesca.Hugh Chisholm. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition. HUARTE DE SAN JUAN. Cambridge England: at the University press. Published 1910.

Psicothema. 2006. Vol. 18, n¬∫ 2, pp. 232-37. Though it appears doubtful whether he practiced as a physician at Huesca, Huarte distinguished himself by his professional skill and heroic zeal during the plague which devastated Baeza in 1566. For a very short period of time, he was appointed doctor by the Cathedral Chapter in 1573. After six months of holding this position, he was fired when he left without permission to request licenses for printing his magnum opus, Examen de ingenios para las sciencias (The Examination of Men's Wits) or \\"The Examination of Talents for the Professions.\\" In his personal life, he married a woman named √Ågueda, and they had three children: Antonia (born between 1568-1576), √Ågueda, and Luis.

Front page of ‚Ä≥Examen de ingenios para las sciencias‚Ä≥ (edition 1603; first Spanish edition 1575). Huarte published the first edition of his Examen de ingenios para las ciencias (The Examination of Men's Wits) in 1575, which won him a European reputation, and was translated by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Despite its initial proscription by the Inquisition, copies of the Examen were found in many of Barcelona's public and private libraries (including those of Joaqu√≠n Setant√≠, Jeroni Tarrassa, Joan Nadal de Prats, Pau Ignasi de Dalmases and the library of the Jesuit school).Honored Citizens of Barcelona by J.S. Amelang Though now superseded, Huarte's treatise is historically interesting as the first attempt to show the connection between psychology and physiology, and its acute ingenuity is as remarkable as the boldness of its views. After his death, a second, revised and expurgated (by the Inquisition) version was published.Juli√°n Velarde Lombra√±a. HUARTE DE SAN JUAN, PATRONO DE PSICOLOG√çA. Psicothema. 1993. Vol. 5, n¬∫ 2, pp. 451-458. Between 1575 and 1800, sixty different editions of Examen were published. During the 16th, 17th and 18th century, the Examen was translated into six European languages: French, Italian, English, Latin, German and Dutch.Javier Viru√©s Ortega. JUAN HUARTE DE SAN JUAN IN CARTESIAN AND MODERN PSYCHOLINGUISTICS: AN ENCOUNTER WITH NOAM CHOMSKY. Psicothema. 2005. Vol. 17, n¬∫ 3, pp. 436-440. Richard Carew was the translator of Examen de Ingenios into English, basing his translation on Camilli's Italian version. (This book is the first systematic attempt to relate physiology with psychology, though based on the medicine of Galen. Four editions of this translation were published: in 1594, 1596, 1604 and 1616.)Carew Survey of Cornwall. London, 1953; pp. 32-37, 323 Theories =Talent= He set forth the following theories in his Examen de ingenios para las ciencias: First, it is only possible for someone to have a lone talent, rather than multiple talents. Huarte considered this single talent to be differentiated in a high degree, with differentiation between individuals and nations. Second, it is critical to fulfill a profession that is in agreement with the talent a person possesses. Third, if the individual is \\"lacking genius,\\" he or she struggles in a futile way with science. Finally, each talent is marked by a temperament which is corresponding to the physique of a person. This concept relates to his theory on humoral temperaments.Dieckh√∂fer, K. [JUAN HUARTE OF SAN JUAN AND HIS SIGNIFICANCE FOR DIFFERENTIAL PSYCHOLOGY]. Zeitschrift f√ºr Klinische Psycholgie und Psychotherapie. 1978. Vol. 26, n¬∫ 3, pp. 207-14. =Children= In Examen, Huarte discusses the treatment of children as it relates to their abilities. In line with his theory regarding single talents, Huarte believed some children are proficient in one particular area while others are not. Because they have these differences, children should be studied while they are young to ascertain their abilities so they can learn efficiently in the area they excel in. While Huarte wanted children to begin acquiring knowledge related to their talents at a young age, he was aware that the tasks would have to be developmentally appropriate. Applying this, children would learn language earlier and logic when they are older.King, D. Brett, Viney, Wayne, & Woody, William Douglas. [A HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY: IDEAS AND CONTEXT]. Pearson Education, Inc. 2009. 4th edition. pp. 114-115. =Humoral Temperaments= As mentioned above, Huarte believed that humoral temperaments had an effect on individual differences. He believed that levels of heat, cold, moistness, and dryness would result in these differences. During this time, humoral temperaments were used to explain differences in age, ethnicity, and intellect. However, Huarte applied the idea of humoral temperaments in a different way. He suggested that humoral temperaments had an effect on differences in memory and understanding. In his theory, memory was dependent on moistness while understanding was dependent on dryness. Following his theory, he believed older people had brains that were dry (understanding), but that means the person has a poor memory as well. Children, on the other hand, were believed to have the opposite problem: they had moist brains useful for memory tasks, but were low in understanding because they were lacking dryness. Huarte also stated that for everyone, memory is better in the morning and worsens throughout the day because brains accumulate moisture while sleeping and dry out over the waking hours. =Behavior= Huarte stressed \\"somatic determinants of behavior\\" which originate in the brain. His theory on this combined Greek philosophy with significance placed on the natural determinants of behavior and Christian theology with attention drawn to miraculous enlightenment. His interest in natural determinants of behavior signifies him as a notable pioneer in the field of differential psychology.Diamond, S. [THE ROOTS OF PSYCHOLOGY: A SOURCE BOOK IN THE HISTORY OF IDEAS]. Basic Books. 1974. =Gender= In keeping with tradition during the time, Huarte did not have positive views toward women. He aided in perpetuating the views related to gender differences by using his theory regarding humoral temperaments. According to Huarte, women could not be blamed for being dull, because they were both cold and dry (a humoral temperamental characterization of their gender). In conjunction with this, Huarte taught that intelligence is stored in the testicles, thus justifying his theory that women are, by nature more stupid than men. Historians can interpret these paternalistic biases coinciding with his desire to understand individual differences as insight into how psychologists shaped and supported social norms during and after their time, and use this knowledge to question other gender-differentiated results. Influence In 1983, Huarte de San Juan was named the patron of Spanish psychology by Spain's psychology of decanos (deans). Examen de ingenios para las ciencias has been acknowledged as being a paradigm for organizational psychology, psychological assessment, Cartesian linguistics, and others. It has been suggested by Mart√≠n-Araguz that neuropsychologists would find Huarte's work relevant to their field, and that he may have been the founder of neuropsychology. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Examen was thought of as the best known medical treaty available. His influence can be seen (though not always cited) in the work of Miguel de Cervantes (whose Don Quixote was inspired by him), Francis Bacon, Pierre Charron, Immanuel Kant, Noam Chomsky, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, David Hume, Montesquieu, Friedrich Nietzsche, Francisco de Quevedo, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Arthur Schopenhauer, Jakob Thomasius, and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.Mart√≠n- Araguz, A, & Bustamante-Mart√≠nez, C. [THE EXAMINATION OF MEN'S WITS BY JUAN HUARTE DE SAN JUAN, AND THE DAWN OF THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF INTELLIGENCE IN THE SPANISH RENAISSANCE]. Revista de Neurolog√≠a. 2004. Vol. 38, n¬∫ 12, pp. 1176-85. Additionally, Huarte's position on women provides support for the suggestion that the Renaissance was a time for men to make intellectual strides, and that women did not have this chance.

He served in the post from 1988 to 1997, under the governorship of Lord Wilson of Tillyorn and the last governor, Chris Patten. Early life Mathews was born on 14 December 1941. He is the son of George James and Ivy Pricilla Mathews. He was educated at Palmer's Grammar School in England. He qualified as a solicitor of England and Wales in 1963 and was in private practice in England until 1965, when he moved to Australia. In Australia, he was Deputy District Registrar of the High Court of Australia in Sydney.Who's Who, 2012. Career in Hong Kong Mathews moved to Hong Kong in 1968, where he was appointed a Crown Counsel. He was appointed deputy Law Draftsman in 1978. In 1982 he was appointed Crown Solicitor, having been appointed deputy the year before. In 1988 he was appointed the final Attorney General of Hong Kong succeeding Michael David Thomas QC. He was the first solicitor to be appointed attorney general in Hong Kong. Mathews was a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council from 1985 to 1995. He was awarded a CMG in 1989.Who's Who, 2012. Soon after becoming attorney general, Mathews had to deal with three scandals involving the Attorney General's Chambers. The first involved Christopher Harris, a senior Crown Counsel, who was caught procuring a girl under 12 for sex. On advice from a private barrister, Mathews decided not to prosecute Harris. After a public outcry, and after seeking further advice, he reversed the decision and Harris was convicted and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment.The Other Hong Kong Report, 1996, p27 Second, the same year, Warwick Reid, the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, was investigated for receiving bribes and absconded. Mathews admitted later he allowed Reid to stay in his position even though he knew he was under investigation. (Mathews may have been prevented by the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance from saying anything to Reid to suggest he was under investigation.)The Other Hong Kong Report, 1996, p27 The third was his last- minute intervention in a wounding case involving an English Cathay Pacific pilot Ian Wilkinson. At the criminal trial rather than calling evidence an agreed fact sheet was prepared (without the victim's prior knowledge or consent, which was immediately disputed by the wife's lawyers). The intervention by Matthews raised questions about the administration of justice and the rule of law in Hong Kong as well as the way in which Matthews had handled the matter which had effectively prevented the wife from taking out a private prosecution.

He began production of Tennent's lager in 1885, having acquired his brother's share of the business a year earlier. Early life Tennent was born in Glasgow the second son of Charles Stewart Parker Tennent and Arabella Jane Hay (after Charles Tennent's death, Arabella married Richard Frederick Fotheringham Campbell).\\"The Scottish law reporter\\" Volume VI His great-great-grandfather, also Hugh Tennent, founded the Tennent‚Äôs Wellpark Brewery, Glasgow in the 1760s. Hugh had one older brother, Archibald Hay Tennent, who was three years his senior. His father's brother was also Hugh Tennent (1780-1864). Hugh‚Äôs father and grandfather both died in 1864 when he was only a year old. For the next twenty years the firm was successfully run by trustees. During this time the business was built to a value of more than ¬£300,000. The brewery was greatly extended, the plant was modernized and the products promoted internationally. Career In his late teens Tennent took on a senior management role until in 1884, aged 21, he became sole partner of the firm and proprietor of the works. His 21st birthday was celebrated by a banquet in Glasgow City Hall and upon taking control of his father‚Äôs business he gave gifts of money to all his employees, numbering at that time between five and six hundred. Hugh Tennent took a close interest in the German industry and its rapid expansion into export markets. In 1881, while still in a senior management position, he travelled on the first of many visits to Bavaria. He was accompanied by Wyllie Clarke, who later became managing director. During the trip they familiarised themselves with lager brewing. Inspired by the Bavarian lagers Hugh Tennent first brewed Tennent's lager in 1885. The transition to lager production was made easier as key parts of the brewing processes in Scotland and Bavaria were similar for example low- temperature fermentation. He later built a new lager brewery on the Wellpark site, which was begun in 1889 and completed in 1891. At the time the enterprise earned the contempt of a local newspaper who hailed it as a ‚Äòmadman‚Äôs dream‚Äô. The lager brewery was set up by engineers with the firm L.A. Riedinger of Augsburg, which had previously set up plants in locations as far apart as Tiflis, Yoklahoma, Cuba and Buenos Aires. Death The Tennent grave, Glasgow Necropolis Hugh Tennent died at 40 Westbourne Gardens in GlasgowTennent grave, Glasgow Necropolis, unmarried and childless, in 1890 at age twenty-seven.\\"The Brewing industry: a guide to historical records\\" His body is buried at the base of the rockface in the southmost section of the Glasgow Necropolis facing the Wellpark Brewery. Above his share of the firm, his personal estate was worth at least a quarter of a million pounds. A second Tennent trust was set up to run the business, but Hugh Tennent was the last member of the family in direct control of Tennent‚Äôs.

A monolithic dome (from Greek mono- and -lithic, meaning \\"one stone\\") is a structure cast in a one-piece form. The form may be permanent or temporary and may or may not remain part of the finished structure. Monolithic domes are a form of monolithic architecture. History The igloo may be the earliest form of monolithic dome. While it is constructed of blocks of compressed snow, these blocks melt and re-freeze to form a strong, homogeneous structure. The dome-like shape of the igloo exhibits the two major advantages of a dome-shaped structure: great strength, and good insulation. The strength is due to the natural strength of the arch, and the insulation is due to the minimal surface area of a spherical section. The first modern monolithic dome structure was built in Provo, Utah, by architect Lee C. Knell, and opened in 1963 as an ice skating rink. Called Turtle Reams after its 1967 conversion into a general store by new owner Paul Ream, the building stood until it was demolished in 2006 for new construction. Turtle Reams was built by first creating a mound of dirt in the desired shape of the shell, an ellipsoidal section long, wide and high. The mound was then covered in a grid of rebar, to provide strength, and a layer of concrete approximately thick. After the concrete was cured, the dirt was excavated through the doorways, leaving the roof standing in its place. The floor was then poured to finish the structure. Today, monolithic domes are used in a variety of residential, commercial and industrial projects. Because of the strength, durability and economics, they are used to store large amounts of various commodities in the cement, fertilizer, agricultural, power and mining industries. Due to their structural integrity, they are used as the containment buildings at some nuclear power plants. Forms have been made using nearly every common structural material including air pressure supported fabric. Current construction methods Modern construction differs significantly from the original concrete-over-dirt method. The current methods were developed by three brothers from Idaho: David, Barry, and Randy South. The first dome built using these method was constructed in April 1976 in Shelley, Idaho: *A reinforced concrete foundation, or \\"ring beam\\", is constructed, defining the shape of the base of the structure. *The fabric form, or air form, is attached to the foundation and inflated with an air blower. The air form contains an airlock to allow workers to enter the form while it is inflated. *A layer of polyurethane foam is sprayed on the interior of the form. (Its purposes are to give rigidity to the air form, secure the re-bar in place, provide support for spraying in the concrete mixture, and insulate the final structure.) *Rebar is attached to the outside layer of foam, using clips that are attached to the foam. *Several inches of concrete are sprayed over the re-bar frame. *After the concrete has set, the blower is turned off. *The exposed surface of the air form may be left as is, or a surface treatment such as paint, tile, etc., may be applied. (Proper selection of air form material will ensure prevention from long-term degradation due to ultraviolet radiation.) In instances where necessity requires economical construction for multiple small and basic dwellings, the dome can be built without insulation and the air form can be removed after completion and re- used to build additional domes. Durability This domed government building in Baghdad, formerly a part of Saddam Hussein's regime, was hit by a . bomb.Air Force Link - Week In Photos Gallery View Apart from the hole made by the entry of the bomb, it remained structurally sound. The dome, when finished, is earthquake, tornado and hurricane resistant (the US Federal Emergency Management Agency rates them as \\"near-absolute protection\\" from F5 tornadoes and Category 5 Hurricanes). Recently, a number of monolithic domes constructed using MDI techniques have survived major disasters: *Several monolithic domes in Florida survived direct hits by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. *Many monolithic domes were in the path of the 2005 and 2006 wildfires in Oklahoma and Texas, and survived with only slight charring of the exterior foam insulation. *In 2003, a monolithic dome government building in Iraq survived a direct hit by a . bomb. The interior of the structure was totally destroyed, but the dome itself remained standing (see picture). The demolition of Turtle Reams also demonstrated the durability of the monolithic dome structure. A wrecking ball demolished a strip several feet wide around the perimeter of the structure, without a collapse. When a doorway on one side was pulled down, the dome finally tipped over, and collapsed. Climate control The monolithic dome, for a number of reasons, is very energy efficient. The spherical sections of the dome offer minimal surface area for the volume they contain, so there is less surface for heat transfer with the outside air. The one piece construction of the monolithic dome also eliminates many of the seams through which air can leak, though this is mitigated to some degree in residential domes by the addition of multiple doors and windows. By placing the insulating foam on the outside of the concrete shell, the concrete acts as a thermal mass inside the building, reducing interior temperature fluctuations far more than the traditional home's insulation inside of a brick or stone veneer. Disadvantages While the monolithic dome has numerous demonstrated engineering advantages, there are also some disadvantages, both engineering and social. =Engineering= *The techniques used in monolithic dome construction are very different from normal construction methods, so only specially trained construction crews are suited for building a dome using the modern techniques. *The curved surfaces inherent to monolithic dome construction often result in oddly shaped rooms when divided up, which can result in wasted space in narrow corners. There are issues of wasted floor space due to wall curvature and problems fitting furniture, similar to those of Quonset huts. This effect can be minimized by constructing the dome on a stem wall, or by using an airform of such shape as to allow for straight, vertical walls at ground level. *The monolithic dome's lack of seams may make it too well sealed; dehumidifiers are required in all but the driest climates. =Social= Social disadvantages of monolithic domes are to a large degree shared by geodesic domes, due to the similar shape and unorthodox construction. These disadvantages are: *The radically different appearance of the domes also decreases the appeal for their use as private residences‚Äîthe standard circular base doesn't fit well on small lots found in many areas, and the strange appearance and design may run afoul of neighborhood building covenants. Depending on the situation, a large variety of variations available from the standard circular shape can avoid some of these problems. *Building permits may be difficult to obtain if local officials are not familiar with the monolithic dome. *Resale of a monolithic dome home may be difficult because of its unconventional appearance.

History Pay television exists to make revenue from subscribers, and sometimes those subscribers do not pay. The prevention of piracy on cable and satellite networks has been one of the main factors in the development of Pay TV encryption systems. The early cable-based Pay TV networks used no security. This led to problems with people connecting to the network without paying. Consequently, some methods were developed to frustrate these self-connectors. The early Pay TV systems for cable television were based on a number of simple measures. The most common of these was a channel- based filter that would effectively stop the channel being received by those who had not subscribed. These filters would be added or removed according to the subscription. As the number of television channels on these cable networks grew, the filter-based approach became increasingly impractical. Other techniques such as adding an interfering signal to the video or audio began to be used as the simple filter solutions were easily bypassed. As the technology evolved, addressable set-top boxes became common, and more complex scrambling techniques such as digital encryption of the audio or video cut and rotate (where a line of video is cut at a particular point and the two parts are then reordered around this point) were applied to signals. Encryption was used to protect satellite-distributed feeds for cable television networks. Some of the systems used for cable feed distribution were expensive. As the DTH market grew, less secure systems began to be used. Many of these systems (such as OAK Orion) were variants of cable television scrambling systems that affected the synchronisation part of the video, inverted the video signal, or added an interfering frequency to the video. All of these analogue scrambling techniques were easily defeated. In France, Canal+ launched a scrambled service in 1984. It was also claimed that it was an unbreakable system. Unfortunately for that company, an electronics magazine, \\"Radio Plans\\", published a design for a pirate decoder within a month of the channel launching. In the USA, HBO was one of the first services to encrypt its signal using the VideoCipher II system. In Europe, FilmNet scrambled its satellite service in September 1986, thus creating one of the biggest markets for pirate satellite TV decoders in the world, because the system that FilmNet used was easily hacked. One of FilmNet's main attractions was that it would screen hard-core porn films on various nights of the week. The VideoCipher II system proved somewhat more difficult to hack, but it eventually fell prey to the pirates. Conditional access =Cable and early satellite television encryption= A scrambled channel featuring a Paramount Pictures film (Possibly VideoCipher II or Oak ORION. Horizontal and vertical synch signal have been replaced by digital data with the effect that the picture is not properly displayed on the TV screen. ) as viewed without a decoder. Analog and digital pay television have several conditional access systems that are used for pay-per-view (PPV) and other subscriber related services. Originally, analog-only cable television systems relied on set-top boxes to control access to programming, as television sets originally were not \\"cable-ready\\". Analog encryption was typically limited to premium channels such as HBO or channels with adult-oriented content. In those cases, various proprietary video synchronization suppression methods were used to control access to programming. In some of these systems, the necessary sync signal was on a separate subcarrier though sometimes the sync polarity is simply inverted, in which case, if used in conjunction with PAL, a SECAM L TV with a cable tuner can be used to partially descramble the signal though only in black and white and with inverted luminance and thus a multi standard TV which supports PAL L is preferred to decode the color as well. This, however will lead to a part of the video signal being received as audio as well and thus another TV with preferably no auto mute should be used for audio decoding. Analog set-top boxes have largely been replaced by digital set-top boxes that can directly control access to programming as well as digitally decrypt signals. Although several analog encryption types were tested in the early 1980s, VideoCipher II became the de-facto analog encryption standard that C-Band satellite pay TV channels used. Early adopters of VCII were HBO and Cinemax, encrypting full time beginning in January 1986; Showtime and The Movie Channel beginning in May 1986; and CNN and Headline news, in July of that year. VideoCipher II was replaced as a standard by VCII+ in the early 1990s, and it in turn was replaced by VCII+ RS. A VCII-capable satellite receiver is required to decode VCII channels. VCII has largely been replaced by DigiCipher 2 in North America. Originally, VCII-based receivers had a separate modem technology for pay-per-view access known as Videopal. This technology became fully integrated in later-generation analog satellite television receivers. * VideoCipher I (deprecated) * VideoCipher II (deprecated) * VideoCipher II+ * VideoCipher II RS (Renewable Security) =Digital cable and satellite television encryption= DigiCipher 2 is General Instrument's proprietary video distribution system. DigiCipher 2 is based upon MPEG-2. A 4DTV satellite receiver is required to decode DigiCipher 2 channels. In North America, most digital cable programming is accessed with DigiCipher 2-based set-top boxes. DigiCipher 2 may also be referred to as DCII. PowerVu is another popular digital encryption technology used for non-residential usage. PowerVu was developed by Scientific Atlanta. Other commercial digital encryption systems are, Nagravision (by Kudelski), Viaccess (by France Telecom), and Wegener. In the US, both DirecTV and Dish Network direct-broadcast satellite systems use digital encryption standards for controlling access to programming. DirecTV uses VideoGuard, a system designed by NDS. DirecTV has been cracked in the past, which led to an abundance of cracked smartcards being available on the black market. However, a switch to a stronger form of smart card (the P4 card) wiped out DirectTV piracy soon after it was introduced. Since then, no public cracks have become available. Dish Network uses Nagravision (2 and 3) encryption. The now-defunct VOOM and PrimeStar services both used General Instruments/Motorola equipment, and thus used a DigiCipher 2-based system very similar to that of earlier 4DTV large dish satellite systems. In Canada, both Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct DBS systems use digital encryption standards. Bell TV, like Dish Network, uses Nagravision for encryption. Shaw Direct, meanwhile, uses a DigiCipher 2-based system, due to their equipment also being sourced from General Instruments/Motorola. Older television encryption systems =Zenith Phonevision= Zenith Electronics developed an encryption scheme for their Phonevision system of the 1950s and 1960s. =Oak ORION= Oak Orion was originally used for analog satellite television pay channel access in Canada. It was innovative for its time as it used digital audio. It has been completely replaced by digital encryption technologies. Oak Orion was used by Sky Channel in Europe between the years 1982 and 1987. Oak developed related encryption systems for cable TV and broadcast pay TV services such as ONTV. =Leitch Technology= Leitch Viewguard is an analog encryption standard used primarily by broadcast TV networks in North America. Its method of scrambling is by re-ordering the lines of video (Line Shuffle), but leaves the audio intact. Terrestrial broadcast CATV systems in Northern Canada used this conditional access system for many years. It is only occasionally used today on some satellite circuits because of its similarity to D2-MAC and B-MAC. There was also a version that encrypted the audio using a digital audio stream in the horizontal blanking interval like the VCII system. One US network used that for its affiliate feeds and would turn off the analog sub carriers on the satellite feed. =B-MAC= B-MAC has not been used for DTH applications since PrimeStar switched to an all-digital delivery system in the mid-1990s. =VideoCrypt= VideoCrypt was an analogue cut and rotate scrambling system with a smartcard based conditional access system. It was used in the 1990s by several European satellite broadcasters, mainly British Sky Broadcasting. It was also used by Sky New Zealand (Sky-NZ). One version of Videocrypt (VideoCrypt-S) had the capability of scrambling sound. A soft encryption option was also available where the encrypted video could be transmitted with a fixed key and any VideoCrypt decoder could decode it. =RITC Discret 1= RITC Discret 1 is a system based on horizontal video line delay and audio scrambling. The start point of each line of video was pseudorandomly delayed by either 0 ns, 902 ns, or 1804 ns. First used in 1984 by French channel Canal Plus, it was widely compromised after the December 1984 issue of \\"Radio Plans\\" magazine printed decoder plans. The BBC also used the Discret system in the late 1980s, as part of testing the use of off-air hours for encrypted specialist programming, with BMTV (British Medical Television) being broadcast on BBC Two. This would ultimately lead to the launch of the scrambled BBC Select service in the early 1990s. =SATPAC= Used by European channel FilmNet, the SATPAC interfered with the horizontal and vertical synchronisation signals and transmitted a signal containing synchronisation and authorisation data on a separate subcarrier. The system was first used in September 1986 and saw many upgrades as it was easily compromised by pirates. By September 1992, FilmNet changed to D2-MAC EuroCrypt. =Telease MAAST / Sat-Tel SAVE= Added an interfering sine wave of a frequency circa 93.750 kHz to the video signal. This interfering signal was approximately six times the frequency of the horizontal refresh. It had an optional sound scrambling using Spectrum Inversion. Used in the UK by BBC for its world service broadcasts and by the now defunct UK movie channel \\"Premiere\\". =Payview III= Used by German/Swiss channel Teleclub in the early 1990s, this system employed various methods such as video inversion, modification of synchronisation signals, and a pseudo line delay effect. =D2-MAC EuroCrypt= Conditional Access system using the D2-MAC standard. Developed mainly by France Telecom, the system was smartcard based. The encryption algorithm in the smartcard was based on DES. It was one of the first smart card based systems to be compromised. =Nagravision analogue system= An older Nagravision system for scrambling analogue satellite and terrestrial television programs was used in the 1990s, for example by the German pay-TV broadcaster Premiere. In this line-shuffling system, 32 lines of the PAL TV signal are temporarily stored in both the encoder and decoder and read out in permuted order under the control of a pseudorandom number generator. A smartcard security microcontroller (in a key-shaped package) decrypts data that is transmitted during the blanking intervals of the TV signal and extracts the random seed value needed for controlling the random number generation. The system also permitted the audio signal to be scrambled by inverting its spectrum at 12.8 kHz using a frequency mixer.

Homeotropic alignment is the state in which a rod-like liquid crystalline molecule aligns perpendicularly to the substrate. In the polydomain state, the parts also are called homeotropic domains. In contrast, the state in which the molecule aligns to a substance in parallel is called homogeneous alignment. There are various other ways of alignment in liquid crystals. Because homeotropic alignment is not anisotropic optically, a dark field is observed between crossed polarizers in polarizing optical microscopy. By conoscope observation, however, a cross image is observed in the homeotropic alignments. Homeotropic alignment often appears in the smectic A phase (SA). In discotic liquid crystals homeotropic alignment is defined as the state in which an axis of the column structure, which is formed by disc- like liquid crystalline molecules, aligns perpendicularly to a substance. In other words, this alignment looks like a state in which columns formed by piled-up coins are arranged in an orderly way on a table. In practice, the homeotropic alignment is usually achieved by surfactants and detergent for example lecithin, some esilanes or some special polyimide (PI 1211).

Located in the Gamo Gofa Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region about 500 kilometers south of Addis Ababa, at an elevation of 1285 meters above sea level. It is the largest town in Gamo Gofa Zone and the second town in SNNPR next to Awassa. It is surrounded by Arba Minch Zuria woreda and the most resourceful zone in southern region including two largest Lakes in Ethiopia (Chamo and Abaya), more than 40 springs, National Nech sar park, crocodile market, several fruits including banana, apple, mango, avocado, etc.  Overview  A monument in Arba Minch Arba Minch received its name for the abundant local springs which produce a groundwater forest. Located at the base of the western side of the Great Rift Valley, Arba Minch consists of the uptown administrative centre of Shecha and 4 kilometers away the downtown commercial and residential areas of Sikela, which are connected by a paved road. On the eastern side of Sikela is the gate to Nechisar National Park, which covers the isthmus between Lake Abaya to the north and Lake Chamo to the south. Buses and taxis connect the uptown and downtown parts; both parts have schools.Philip Briggs, Ethiopia: The Bradt Travel Guide, 3rd edition (Chalfont St Peters: Bradt, 2002), p. 229 Kulfo River flows through the town, and drains into Lake Chamo. Arba Minch is known as a source for fruit, including mango, banana, orange, apple, guava and pineapple, and is also known for its fish farms. Indicating its richness of fish a local singer named Abile Chedo sang the song \\"Nu Dere Gamo Gofa Oycha Arbaminche muziri kalsi yedes Abaya-Chamo mole\\". It is the home of Arba Minch University and the Southwest Synod of the Mekane Yesus Church. The town also is served by Arba Minch Airport, (ICAO code HAAM, IATA AMH).  History  Arba Minch was founded in the early 1960s by then Fitawrari Aemeroselasie Abebe and the city succeeded Chencha as the provincial capital of Gamo Gofa. The oral tradition has it that Fitawrari Aemiro Selassie Abebe had to fight with prominent figures of Chencha (Aba Gaga) to move the capital from Chencha to Arbaminch. One of the reasons for Aemiroselassie Abebe to move the provincial centre from Chencha to Arbaminch was for travelers from Gidole to Chencha to take a break after a long, hot crossing of the arid Rift Valley. Roads were built linking the new town to Soddo and making Arba Minch only a day's journey by road to the capital, Addis Ababa. A telephone line connecting the town to the capital, costing E$ 250,000, was turned up on 15 July 1967.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 6 June 2008) The Norwegian Lutheran Mission opened a station at Arba Minch in 1970, which included a trade school; the school's operation was later taken over by the Mekane Yesus Church. At the beginning of the Ethiopian Revolution public demonstrations occurred in the town, and four people were killed in clashes with the police on 28 March 1974. Following the revolution privately held plantations were made into state farms. The 193 million birr Arba Minch Textile Mill was opened on 6 May 1992 in the presence of Ethiopian Prime Minister Tamirat Layne. The mill would produce polyester mixed with cotton grey fabrics. According to the SNNPR's Bureau of Finance and Economic Development, other amenities in Arba Minch include postal service, 24-hour electrical service, a bank and a hospital.\\"Detailed statistics on hotels and tourism\\" , Bureau of Finance and Economic Development website (accessed 4 September 2009) May 2010, the Ethiopian Roads Authority awarded a contract worth 563 million E$ to the construction firm of Brehane Hagos to build a road 60 kilometers in length from this town to Belta.\\"Tigray, Southern Towns Get First Roads\\", Addis Fortune 2 May 2010 (accessed 5 May 2010) The United States military operated a facility at Arba Minch from 2011 until September 2015.

A dropout is a type of fork end that allows the rear wheel to be removed without first derailing the chain. Track bicycle frames have track fork ends, on which the opening faces rearwards. Because they do not have dropouts, the chain must be derailed from the sprocket before the rear wheel can be removed from a typical track bike. Some single-speed bicycles intended for street or trail use are also equipped with track fork ends instead of dropouts. On bicycles that do not have a derailleur or other chain tensioning device, rear horizontal dropouts allow adjustment of chain tension, and can accommodate a range of chain lengths or cog sizes. They were standard on most older derailleur bicycles from before the 1990s. An older derailleur-equipped bicycle with horizontal dropouts can be readily converted into singlespeed, fixed gear or to use an internally geared hub. Rear vertical dropouts have the slot facing downwards. The advantage is that the wheel axle cannot slip forward compared with horizontal dropouts. The disadvantage is that on a bicycle without a rear derailleur but with vertical dropouts, the chain tension cannot be adjusted by moving the wheel forwards or backwards, and needs another means of chain-tensioning, by a derailleur, chain tensioner, or eccentric bottom bracket or rear hub. Fixed wheel bicycles cannot use any form of chain tensioning device, because the lower run of chain is pulled very tight when using the transmission as a brake. In general, a modern bicycle frame intended for derailleur gears will have a vertical dropout, while one designed for singlespeed or hub gears will have horizontal dropouts or track fork ends.  Features  Lawyer lips on a front fork end (not a dropout) =Lawyer lips= Lawyer lips or lawyer tabs (a type of positive retention device), a nineteenth century inventionhttps://ia800504.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/9/items/cycleagetradere231899nati/cycleagetradere231899nati_jp2.zip&file;=cycleagetradere231899nati_jp2/cycleagetradere231899nati_0078.jp2&scale;=3&rotate;=0, are tabs fitted to the fork ends on the front fork of bicycles sold in some countries (particularly the U.S.) to prevent a wheel from leaving the fork if the quick release skewer comes undone. They were reintroduced in response to lawsuits supported by experts including John Howardhttps://ultracycling.com/john-howard/, in cases where incorrectly adjusted quick release wheels came out of the forks. Lawyer tabs are designed to compensate for the fact that many riders do not know how to operate a quick release properly: some riders treat them as a folding wing nut, and others do not tighten them enough for fear of snapping them or shearing the skewer (both are not likely given the normal range of human strength, and the mechanical advantages involved, as long as the skewer is not damaged or flawed). A side- effect is that the quick release, which was developed to allow the wheel to be removed without having to unscrew any components, no longer works as designed: the skewer must be unscrewed in order to remove the wheel (although tools do remain unnecessary). This means that the tension on refitting must be adjusted again. Some cyclists file off the lawyer tabs so the quick release works as originally intended. A correctly secured quick release is unlikely to be ejected from the fork end in normal use where rim brakes are in use, although recently there has been some evidence, notably from James Annan, a British scientist working in Japan, suggesting that the moments in disc brake systems can cause quick-release front wheels to be ejected past the lawyer tabs. A small number of serious crashes have been attributed to this cause. This is controversial, and the fork manufacturers have not admitted a fault, although there is some evidence that they may accept the principle, and advice on checking quick release tension has been strengthened. A complete solution to ejection risk would involve mounting the front disc brake caliper in front of the fork blade rather than behind, as the reaction force on the disc would then be into, rather than out of, the fork-end. However, this would involve major retooling by fork and brake manufacturers, though at least one manufacturer has placed the disc caliper mounts on the front of the right fork blade. This allows standard disc brakes to be used, and also makes it easier to mount mudguards. =Eyelets= Fork ends and dropouts may support one or more eyelets, small protruding tabs with holes, often threaded, to facilitate the mounting of racks and fenders. Mikashima Chaintug on a Keirin bicycle =Chaintugs= Some rear track fork ends have threaded devices (\\"chaintugs\\") to aid in setting the proper chain tension. These may be integral to the fork end or separate items. They work by holding the rear axle in an eye at the end of a threaded bolt. The bolt passes through a cap which fits over the open fork end. Tightening the bolts on each side causes the axle to be pulled backwards towards the open fork end, tensing the chain. Chaintugs can also solve the problem of \\"axle creep\\" on hard-ridden fixed-gear bicycles, especially those with hard chromed fork ends, which may not offer adequate grip for the serrated track nuts. = Derailleur hanger = A semi-horizontal dropout on a steel frame road bicycle converted to a single-speed. The non- replaceable derailleur hanger (below the axle) and an eyelet (above the axle) for mounting a fender or rack are now unused. A vertical dropout on an aluminum frame mountain bike. The silver part is the replaceable derailleur hanger. Replaceable derailleur hanger The derailleur hanger or mech hanger is the part of the dropout that the rear derailleur attaches to. Most non-steel framed bikes have a separate removable derailleur hanger, generally made from aluminium which is bolted to the dropout. These are intended as a cheap replaceable part so that in the event of an accident or mechanical problem that could damage the derailleur or frame, the derailleur hanger breaks or deforms instead. Sometimes a shear bolt which is designed as a weak point will also be used. There are dozens of different derailleur hangers available and one model is seldom interchangeable with another. Because of huge variety, derailleur hangers can be classified : # By number of fitting fasteners: no fitting fasteners, 1 fastener, 2 fastener, 3+ and so on; # By mounting side: inner, outer, clam/fork or others; Derailleur hanger types: inner mount vs outside mount. # By derailleur mounting type: standard mount, standard with adapter/extender or direct mount; # By axle type: 12 mm thru axle, 5 mm QR or others. In general, steel-framed bikes do not have a removable derailleur hanger, because a steel dropout and hanger is stronger and therefore less likely to be damaged, and also it is more malleable and less likely to work harden during deformation and generally can be bent back into shape without breaking. The derailleur hanger must be aligned correctly for proper indexed shifting, with the rear derailleur bolt hole and the rear axle close to parallel. If it is out of alignment, the rear derailleur will not move far enough, with respect to the rear sprockets, with each click. A special tool exists to measure and correct misaligned hangers. On frames with no derailleur hanger, a direct mount derailleur or derailleur with a hanger plate is used. These only fit bikes with horizontal dropouts, and are held in place by a small bolt and the rear wheel axle. These have now been effectively superseded by the derailleur hanger. Since a derailleur designed to be fitted to a separate hanger will be aligned lower on the bike than one that bolts directly onto the frame, it follows that a derailleur must be selected firstly with the mounting method in mind. =Adjustment screws= Some rear, horizontal, forward-facing dropouts have small adjustment screws threaded through the very rear to aid in positioning the axle precisely. The screws may be fitted with springs to keep them from moving. The most common screw size for the adjustment screws is M3.

He also goes by the names Joseph Arias and Joe Arias. 1970s and 1980s After high school he sang with the rock band Purlie, which had a 1973 single on Capitol Records, and then had a stint with improvisational comedy group the Groundlings. In 1976 he and his best friend Kim Hastreiter - who would go on to co-found Paper magazine - drove across country in a pickup truck and moved to New York City. Arias eventually got a job at the Fiorucci designer clothing store. He and other store staff famously performed (danced and modeled clothes) in the shop windows. While working at the store he became friends with alternative musician Klaus Nomi, singing backup and designing sets and costumes. On December 15, 1979, Nomi and Arias appeared on Saturday Night Live accompanying David Bowie for a live performance of three songs: \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\", \\"TVC 15\\" and \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\". While in New York, he also performed with Ann Magnuson in a band called Strange Party which recorded and performed in various night clubs. Upon Nomi's death, Arias became executor to the Klaus Nomi (Sperber) estate. A tribute to his friend is held in Berlin every year, and the documentary film The Nomi Song was released in 2004. A film on the life Arias shared with Nomi was in development in 2010 with Alan Cumming slated to play Nomi. Arias, who is openly gay, gradually became involved in the burgeoning 1980s New York performance art scene, appearing regularly at Club 57 and other downtown venues. During these years he also began crafting a successful career in cabaret, channeling the vocal style and mannerisms of Billie Holiday.  1990s  In the early 1990s, Arias covered the songs of Holiday in a show titled Strange Fruit which ran for over a year at the Astor Theater on Lafayette Street in New York City and received a positive notice from John Lahr in The New Yorker. The 1990s also saw Arias perform in weekly shows at Bar d'O, an intimate lounge in the West Village of New York City. Regular guest performers at Bar d'O included Sade Pendarvis, Daniel Isengart and Flotilla Debarge. The evenings have inspired annual reunion shows each December at Indochine restaurant and became the subject of a 2011 documentary film produced by Bobby Sheehan.  2000s  In 2003 Arias moved to Las Vegas, Nevada to star in Cirque du Soleil's Zumanity at the New York-New York Hotel & Casino. In addition to starring in the show, he co-wrote two of the show's songs. After six years, Arias returned to New York where he starred in Arias with a Twist, a collaboration with puppeteer Basil Twist at HERE Arts Center. Produced by Barbara Busackino and Tandem Otter Productions, the show received a positive review from Ben Brantley in the New York Times. The show has toured to Los Angeles and Paris and spawned a \\"docufantasy\\" film of the same name which premiered at the TriBeCa Film Festival in 2010. Arias with a Twist: Deluxe, a revamped and expanded version of the show, returned to New York for a limited run at Abrons Arts Center from September 14 to October 16, 2011. Arias' relationship with Abrons began in October 2010 when Joey Arias in Concert marked Arias' first concert appearances in New York in over a decade. Based on the success of the show, Earl Dax collaborated with Josh Wood who produced Arias in concert at New York's Town Hall on April 21, 2010.  Current  Arias continues to perform in venues such as Joe's Pub and Feinstein's/54 Below.  Film  Film credits include Big Top Pee-wee; Mondo New York; Elvira, Mistress of the Dark; Flawless; To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar; Wigstock: The Movie and the 2016 film The Zanctuary, by the Spanish director Jos√© Andr√© Sibaja, and co-starring with Amanda Lepore & Sophia Lamar. He appeared in the German documentary Wie ich lernte die Zahlen zu lieben/How I Learned to Love the Numbers (2014) by Oliver Sechting and Max Taubert.  Christmas with the Crawfords  Arias portrayed Joan Crawford in New York and San Francisco productions of Christmas with the Crawfords, an original holiday spoof tradition since 1992 of Christina Crawford's book Mommie Dearest. The San Francisco-based production premiered Off-Off-Broadway at the Grove Street Playhouse in 2000. Arias also starred in a 2001 and 2015 revival of the play at the Chelsea Playhouse.  Personal life  Born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he was six when he moved with his family to Los Angeles. In 2014, Arias married his long time partner, Scottish artist Juano Diaz.They were divorced in 2017.

The line element of a stationary spacetime has the form (i,j = 1,2,3) : ds^{2} = \\\\lambda (dt - \\\\omega_{i}\\\\, dy^i)^{2} - \\\\lambda^{-1} h_{ij}\\\\, dy^i\\\\,dy^j, where t is the time coordinate, y^{i} are the three spatial coordinates and h_{ij} is the metric tensor of 3-dimensional space. In this coordinate system the Killing vector field \\\\xi^{\\\\mu} has the components \\\\xi^{\\\\mu} = (1,0,0,0). \\\\lambda is a positive scalar representing the norm of the Killing vector, i.e., \\\\lambda = g_{\\\\mu u}\\\\xi^{\\\\mu}\\\\xi^{ u}, and \\\\omega_{i} is a 3-vector, called the twist vector, which vanishes when the Killing vector is hypersurface orthogonal. The latter arises as the spatial components of the twist 4-vector \\\\omega_{\\\\mu} = e_{\\\\mu u\\\\rho\\\\sigma}\\\\xi^{ u} abla^{\\\\rho}\\\\xi^{\\\\sigma}(see, for example,Wald, R.M., (1984). General Relativity, (U. Chicago Press) p. 163) which is orthogonal to the Killing vector \\\\xi^{\\\\mu}, i.e., satisfies \\\\omega_{\\\\mu} \\\\xi^{\\\\mu} = 0. The twist vector measures the extent to which the Killing vector fails to be orthogonal to a family of 3-surfaces. A non-zero twist indicates the presence of rotation in the spacetime geometry. The coordinate representation described above has an interesting geometrical interpretation.Geroch, R., (1971). J. Math. Phys. 12, 918 The time translation Killing vector generates a one-parameter group of motion G in the spacetime M. By identifying the spacetime points that lie on a particular trajectory (also called orbit) one gets a 3-dimensional space (the manifold of Killing trajectories) V= M/G, the quotient space. Each point of V represents a trajectory in the spacetime M. This identification, called a canonical projection, \\\\pi : M \\\\rightarrow V is a mapping that sends each trajectory in M onto a point in V and induces a metric h = -\\\\lambda \\\\pi*g on V via pullback. The quantities \\\\lambda, \\\\omega_{i} and h_{ij} are all fields on V and are consequently independent of time. Thus, the geometry of a stationary spacetime does not change in time. In the special case \\\\omega_{i} = 0 the spacetime is said to be static. By definition, every static spacetime is stationary, but the converse is not generally true, as the Kerr metric provides a counterexample. In a stationary spacetime satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations R_{\\\\mu u} = 0 outside the sources, the twist 4-vector \\\\omega_{\\\\mu} is curl-free, : abla_\\\\mu \\\\omega_ u - abla_ u \\\\omega_\\\\mu = 0,\\\\, and is therefore locally the gradient of a scalar \\\\omega (called the twist scalar): : \\\\omega_\\\\mu = abla_\\\\mu \\\\omega.\\\\, Instead of the scalars \\\\lambda and \\\\omega it is more convenient to use the two Hansen potentials, the mass and angular momentum potentials, \\\\Phi_{M} and \\\\Phi_{J}, defined asHansen, R.O. (1974). J. Math. Phys. 15, 46. : \\\\Phi_{M} = \\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\lambda^{-1}(\\\\lambda^{2} + \\\\omega^{2} -1), : \\\\Phi_{J} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\lambda^{-1}\\\\omega. In general relativity the mass potential \\\\Phi_{M} plays the role of the Newtonian gravitational potential. A nontrivial angular momentum potential \\\\Phi_{J} arises for rotating sources due to the rotational kinetic energy which, because of mass‚Äìenergy equivalence, can also act as the source of a gravitational field. The situation is analogous to a static electromagnetic field where one has two sets of potentials, electric and magnetic. In general relativity, rotating sources produce a gravitomagnetic field that has no Newtonian analog. A stationary vacuum metric is thus expressible in terms of the Hansen potentials \\\\Phi_{A} (A=M, J) and the 3-metric h_{ij}. In terms of these quantities the Einstein vacuum field equations can be put in the form : (h^{ij} abla_i abla_j - 2R^{(3)})\\\\Phi_A = 0,\\\\, : R^{(3)}_{ij} = 2[ abla_{i}\\\\Phi_{A} abla_{j}\\\\Phi_{A} - (1+ 4 \\\\Phi^{2})^{-1} abla_{i}\\\\Phi^{2} abla_{j}\\\\Phi^{2}], where \\\\Phi^{2} = \\\\Phi_{A}\\\\Phi_{A} = (\\\\Phi_{M}^{2} + \\\\Phi_{J}^{2}), and R^{(3)}_{ij} is the Ricci tensor of the spatial metric and R^{(3)} = h^{ij}R^{(3)}_{ij} the corresponding Ricci scalar. These equations form the starting point for investigating exact stationary vacuum metrics.

The trail takes about 10 to 15 minutes to navigate from one end to the other, and offers a view of some of the marshland prevalent in the area. Due to the park's location in a quiet residential area, the presence of wildlife is greater than it would be in a park located in the more urban areas of the city. Small fish can be seen in a stream that the trail passes over, as well as crabs. The trails, like most hiking trails in the Newport News Parks system, are open from sunrise to sunset.

Life and career Richard Hughes during the January 2005 Tsunami Relief Cardiff concert Timothy James Rice-Oxley was born in Oxford, England to Charles Patrick and Margaret Rice-Oxley. He has a younger brother, Tom, born in 1979. He had piano lessons when he was a teenager but admitted to hating them and never practising pieces because they were all classical music which he found boring. After his parents stopped his lessons, Rice-Oxley developed a liking for piano and so taught himself how to play, mainly because of The Beatles. Keane Rice-Oxley provides live and studio backing vocals for Keane, except for the studio songs \\"Sunshine\\", \\"This Is the Last Time\\" (demo version) and \\"Your Love\\" where he sings the lead vocals, as well as some Under the Iron Sea DVD and Perfect Symmetry demos. Compositions In 2006, Rice-Oxley co-wrote the songs \\"Early Winter\\", and \\"The Girl Inside\\" (unreleased) on Gwen Stefani's second solo album, The Sweet Escape. \\"Early Winter\\" has been performed by Keane live. The song \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" from the album of the same name is considered by Chaplin to be one of the best Rice-Oxley has written. In 2009, he co-wrote the song \\"Everything Is Beautiful\\" for Kylie Minogue's eleventh studio album, Aphrodite. Rice-Oxley composed all the songs for the side- project Mt.

In the course of his life he wrote approximately fifty research and expository papers in geometry. He is also the author of various core books on mathematics and geometry some of which have remained in print for decades and been translated into several languages. These books include the three-volume Methods of Algebraic Geometry (which he wrote in collaboration with W. V. D. Hodge), The Gentle Art of Mathematics, Circles: A Mathematical View, Geometry and the Visual Arts and most recently Japanese Temple Geometry Problems: San Gaku (with Hidetoshi Fukagawa).  Early life  Daniel Pedoe was born in London in 1910, the youngest of thirteen children of Szmul Abramski, a Jewish immigrant from Poland who found himself in London in the 1890s: he had boarded a cattleboat not knowing whether it was bound for New York or London, so his final destination was one of blind chance. Pedoe's mother, Ryfka Raszka Pedowicz, was the only child of Wolf Pedowicz, a corn merchant and his wife, Sarah Haimnovna Pecheska from ≈Åom≈ºa then in Congress Poland (that part of Poland then under Russian control). The family name requires some explanation. The father, Abramski, was one of the Kohanim, a priestly group, and once in Britain, he changed his surname to Cohen. At first, all thirteen children took the surname Cohen, but later, to avoid any potential anti-semitism, some of the Cohen children changed their surname to Pedoe, a contraction of their mother's maiden name; this happened while Daniel was at school, aged 12. \\"Danny\\" was the youngest child in a family of thirteen children and his childhood was spent in relative poverty in the East End of London, despite their father being a skilled cabinetmaker. He attended the Central Foundation Boys' School where he was first influenced in his love of geometry by the headmaster Norman M. Gibbins and a textbook by Godfrey and Siddons. While still at school, Pedoe published his first paper, The geometric interpretation of Cagnoli's equation: sin b sin c + cos b cos c cos A = sin B sin C ‚Äì cos B cos C cos a; it appeared in the Mathematical Gazette in 1929. He was successful at the \\"ten plus\\" examination and subsequently won a Scholarship to study mathematics at Cambridge University.  Cambridge and Princeton  During his first three years at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he was a scholar, Pedoe was tutored in mathematics by Arthur Stanley Ramsey, the father of Frank P. Ramsey. He attended lectures by Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell, although he was unimpressed by the teaching style of either great man. Geometry became his main interest and, advised by Henry Baker, he started work on his doctorate and published several papers. In 1935 he took a break from Cambridge and went to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton where he worked with Solomon Lefschetz.  University of Southampton and Freeman Dyson  On his return to England in 1936, Pedoe was appointed as an assistant lecturer of the mathematics department at the University College, Southampton. More of his papers were published and after(?) 1937, he was awarded his PhD on the strength of his thesis, The Exceptional Curves on an Algebraic Surface, which was based on Henry Baker's work on the Italian theory of algebraic surfaces; he was examined by W. V. D. Hodge and Baker at Cambridge. In the late 1930s, Pedoe married Mary Tunstall, an English geographer and the couple had a daughter, Naomi, and identical twin sons, Dan and Hugh, born in December 1939. By 1941, Winchester College had lost several teachers to the army and had become unable to meet its teaching commitments. They requested help and Pedoe was asked to assist with the teaching of mathematics. He taught junior and senior classes (the juniors could be unruly) and in the senior class one of the students was Freeman Dyson who showed enormous early talent and was strongly encouraged by Pedoe with extra work and reading. Their friendship lasted more than fifty more years until Pedoe's death in 1998 and Dyson's list of people who have most influenced him begins \\"Hardy, Pedoe...\\". In 1941 a collaboration with W. V. D. Hodge started which lasted some twelve years and included the writing of the huge three-volume work, Methods of Algebraic Geometry. Although the book was originally designed as a geometric counterpart of G. H. Hardy's A Course of Pure Mathematics it was never intended as a textbook and contains original material. First published in the 1940s, all three volumes were reprinted by Cambridge University Press in 1995. Pedoe published three more papers in 1942: A remark on a property of a special pencil of quadrics, On some geometrical inequalities and An inequality for two triangles.  Birmingham University and Westfield College  In 1942, Pedoe moved to Birmingham for a lectureship at the University of Birmingham, working mainly in engineering mathematics. The family were not happy there, the local air pollution affected his children and Pedoe did not like the working environment. The professor of mathematical physics at Birmingham was Rudolf Peierls, who was working on the British project to develop the atomic bomb; he suggested to Pedoe that he, Pedoe, should do some war-work. He did so, and worked part-time to improve piston rings so as to emulate German dive-bombing tactics. In 1947 he moved to Westfield College, part of the University of London, as a reader in mathematics. Once again, he was unhappy, both from domestic and professional points of view: his salary was insufficient for him to afford to buy a family home and he found the working environment to be \\"a strain\\".  Khartoum and Singapore  Encouraged by Mary to look abroad, he was appointed as head of the mathematics department at the University of Khartoum in the Sudan and took up the role in 1952 on trial basis with leave of absence from Westfield College. When Westfield pressed for firm decision, he resigned and stayed at Khartoum for seven years: the length of his contract. It was during this period that he wrote many of his books including The Gentle Art of Mathematics, Circles and a textbook, An Introduction to projective geometry. Pedoe found the time at Khartoum to his taste; there was a comfortable life- style that allowed him to write and the family joined him each Christmas. Eventually, Mary stayed with him permanently, the children remaining in England. In 1959, he was appointed as head of the mathematics department at the University of Singapore by Sir Alexander Oppenheim.  Purdue and Minnesota  Unwilling to retire at 55, the statutory retirement age in Singapore, he moved again, to Indiana in 1962, to take up a position at Purdue University, near Lafayette. Although the location was somewhat isolated, there was an active social life and he was kept busy. One of the positions he held there was as Senior Mathematician to the Minnesota College Geometry Project, which was to improve geometry teaching in high schools and colleges by making films and writing accompanying books. After two years at Purdue, he was appointed as a professor at the University of Minnesota where he stayed until he retired in 1980, when he was made Professor Emeritus. He won a Lester R. Ford Award in 1968.  San Gaku  Pedoe's interest and work continued after his retirement and in 1984 he was approached by Hidetoshi Fukagawa, a high- school teacher in Aichi, Japan. Fukagawa had tried unsuccessfully to interest Japanese academics in San Gaku ‚Äì Japanese wooden tablets containing geometric theorems which had hung in temples and shrines for around two centuries as offerings to the gods. A collaboration started which resulted in the publication of the book, Japanese Temple Geometry Problems by the Charles Babbage Research Centre in Canada. The book succeeded in arousing interest in this uniquely Japanese form of mathematics.  Death  Dan Pedoe died in 1998, aged 88, after a long period with failing health. He was survived by his twin sons, Dan and Hugh Tunstall-Pedoe, and six grandchildren.

Cater was the third Chief Secretary under the Governorship of Sir Murray MacLehose, later Lord MacLehose of Beoch. He is probably most noted for his role as the founding Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption of Hong Kong. Biography =Career= Cater served in Royal Air Force fighter squadrons during the World War II. Cater arrived in Hong Kong to work with the British military jurisdiction after the japanese surrender. Cater began his career of civil service in 1946 as a cadet officer in the Fisheries Department, and was made Director of Agriculture and Fisheries in 1964. In 1966 Cater attended the Imperial Defence College in London. He was appointed by then Governor David Trench to lead the team that restored peace and security following the riots in 1967. He became Defence Secretary and Special Assistant to Governor David Trench during the civil unrest in 1967, and subsequently served as deputy Colonial Secretariat (1967-68), Executive Director of the newly established Trade Development Council (1968-70), Director of Commerce and Industry (1970-72), Secretary for Information (1972-73) and the Secretary for Home Affairs in 1973. Cater was instrumental in establishing schools in all of Hong Kong's fishing villages. In February 1974, he was delighted to accept appointment to the first Commissionership of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) by Murray MacLehose following the flight of Police Superintendent Peter Godber, who was under investigation at the time regarding several million pounds stashed in Vancouver banks. His widow later revealed that Cater considered at one point leaving the government. She said: Cater was widely respected and much liked in Hong Kong for the way in which he brought the fledgling ICAC to the point where it became strong enough to survive the attacks of vested interests, and of its many enemies both within and without the government. As a result of Cater's vital early direction, the ICAC was able to grow into a body which presided over the (almost total) eradication of corruption, both official (Governmental) and elsewhere, in Hong Kong. From 1981 to 1984, Cater became Hong Kong's Commissioner in London. Afterwards, he joined China Light & Power Co., and became the head of Hong Kong Nuclear Investment Co, a nuclear power station venture at Daya Bay in Guangdong province. He was also a consultant to Bechtel, a US engineering contractor, and Philips. In 1995, he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Laws) by the University of Bath. =Personal= Sir Jack was born on 21 February 1922, son of a London policeman. Sir Jack was married to Peggy in 1950. The couple lived most of their life together in Hong Kong, until the late 1990s. They had three children, Susan, Jacqueline, and Richard. Sir Jack and Lady Cater returned to Britain, and settled on Guernsey in the Channel Islands in 2001. Cater suffered from Alzheimer's disease during the final few years of his life. He died in Guernsey on 14 April 2006, aged 84. A memorial was held for him in Hong Kong at the St. John's Cathedral on 21 October 2006, attended by many senior officials and prominent figures, inter alia Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang, Run Run Shaw, David Akers-Jones, former Secretary for Security Alistair Asprey, as well as Raymond Wong and Lily Yam, respectively the then current Commissioner and a former Commissioner of the ICAC.

It is situated on the Havel, and part of the town is built on an island in the centre of the river. The two parts were incorporated as a town in 1875. It has a population of 7,687 (2004). History The Bishopric of Havelberg was founded in 946, by Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor (then a prince), but the bishop tended to live in either Plattenburg or Wittstock, a few miles north of Havelberg. An early bishop was Anselm of Havelberg. Havelberg is home to a former monastery, now used as the Prignitz Museum, which was established in 1904. Havelberg was part of Brandenburg for most of its history. Havelberg was formerly a strong fortress, but in the Thirty Years' War it was taken from the Danish by the imperial troops in 1627. Recaptured by the Swedes in 1631, and again in 1635 and 1636, it was in 1637 retaken by the Saxons. When the German states where dissolved in East Germany in 1952, Havelberg became part of the district of Magdeburg. When the German states were refounded during German Reunification in 1990, the whole district of Magdeburg became part of Saxony- Anhalt, including the formerly- Brandenburgian town of Havelberg.

The book ranks 111th on Publishers Weekly's All-Time Bestselling Children's Book List for the United States, with 1,179,533 copies sold . The plot concerns the theft of gold from a mining camp in Montana. At first the case is being worked on by Fenton Hardy but when he becomes injured he invites his sons Frank and Joe to join him. After overcoming many obstacles the Hardy boys recover the stolen gold and turn the outlaws over to the Sheriff. This book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Leslie McFarlane in 1928. Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The original version of this book was rewritten in 1963 by Alistair Hunter resulting in two different stories with the same title. Plot summary (revised edition) The Hardy Boys head to Montana to help their father who had been working on a case and broke his ribs. They go to the village of Lucky Lode and find a mystery connected to a man they saved, who had been shot by careless hunters in the beginning of the book. The man they saved had his gold stolen; when he was in Lucky Lode mining, he suspected one of his partners who was trying to save the gold had disappeared. When in Lucky Lode, they meet Mr. Burke who owns the general store; they later learn he is a spy called \\"Slip Gun\\", working for Big Al, the villain. They defeat Big Al who was known as Black Pepper when the man they saved lived in Lucky Lode. While hunting for the hidden gold the Hardy Boys spot a cave, so they head into it to search for clues to where the gold might be, but they run into a pack of wolves before they find any clues and have to find a way to get out of the cave. They also find Bart Dawson is Bob Dodge, the man who flew them to Montana, who is revealed to have had amnesia. They end up recovering the gold and round up all the bad guys in the story. Plot summary (original edition) While their father Fenton Hardy is in Montana working on a case of missing gold the Hardy Boys go skating on Shallow Lake with their friends Chet Morton and Jerry Gilroy where they meet Jadbury Wilson, a poor old man who is also a former gold miner from Montana. Wilson tells them his tale of how Bart Dawson, a trusted member of his party, ran off during a gun fight taking four bags of their gold with him for safekeeping but failed to return once the gunfight ended. Upon returning to the Hardy home, with the injured Jadbury Wilson, the Hardy boys receive a telegram from their father requesting that they join him in Montana immediately. After a stranger, claiming to be Mr. Hardy‚Äôs lawyer, ushers the boys onto the wrong train, resulting in their being kidnapped and later escaping, the Hardy boys decide to continue their journey in disguise, finally arriving at Lucky Bottom, Montana to meet with their father. He tells them that they are looking for gold which Bart Dawson claims was stolen from him by an outlaw named Black Pepper and his gang. The next day, while searching for the gold, the Hardy boys are attacked by the gang of outlaws; however they manage to escape and return to town for the night. The following day they manage to catch one member of the gang who gives them information about Black Pepper. Upon searching, they discover a cabin used by Black Pepper, and there they find a map to the hidden gold, indicating it is buried in The Lone Tree mine. While exploring the mine the Hardy boys are attacked by a pack of wolves that chase them down another shaft which happens to be the main mine entrance and the first landmark on the map they found in Black Pepper's cabin. Following the map, the Hardy boys recover the gold which leads to them being attacked by Black Pepper himself. They manage to get the upper hand and march back to town with both the outlaw and the gold, to later learn that Bart Dawson had believed Jadbury Wilson was dead and now that he knows differently he is willing to share the recovered gold. Bart Dawson explains that he had not returned with the gold immediately following the first gun fight because he suffered from amnesia caused by a gunshot to his head.

He later became the second president of the colony which later became Jamestown. He was killed by the Pamunkey Native Americans in 1609. Biography Ratcliffe was born in Lancashire. Many people say he used the alias John Sicklemore, but this was never confirmed. He served as a seaman before going to Virginia, and he may be the Captain Ratcliffe taken prisoner with Sir Henry Cray and Captain Pigott at Mulheim in 1605. =Virginia colony= Ratcliffe commanded Discovery and became a councillor of the Jamestown Colony. Discovery was the smallest of all three ships; it had a crew of only 21 men. He became president of the colony upon the deposition of Edward Maria Wingfield on 10 September 1607. Ratcliffe fell out of favour with many colonists after enlisting men to build a governor's house. Many colonists also disagreed with how he handled trade with the natives and how he performed during the food shortages during the summer of 1608. Ratcliffe was removed in July 1608 and succeeded by Matthew Scrivener. During the administration of George Percy, Ratcliffe was sent in October 1609 to build a fort at Old Point Comfort, which was named \\"Algenourne Fort\\" after one of Percy's ancestors.Tyler, Lyon Gardiner, ed. (1915). Encyclopedia of Virginia Biography, Vol. I, pp. 33‚Äì34. New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company. Ratcliffe worked with explorer John Smith to remove Edward Wingfield from the presidency because he was hiding food for himself that the colony needed. Ratcliffe was elected president and asked Smith to organise work details and expeditions to trade with Native Americans. By January 1608, only 40 colonists were alive, and Ratcliffe and the Council planned to return to England on Discovery. Ratcliffe's overgenerous trading provoked Smith to complain that they would soon run out of items to trade. Ratcliffe left office (either by resignation or deposition) in July 1608, two months before the end of his term. At that point, Ratcliffe had lost the faith of the colonists, who accused him of hoarding rations (recent discoveries say that he was hoarding the rations for his sick children). The colonists were also enraged that as they were sick and dying, Ratcliffe ordered they build a capitol in the woods. The colonists dubbed the project \\"Ratcliffe's Palace.\\" Ratcliffe accompanied Christopher Newport when he sailed from Virginia in 1608. In May 1609, he commanded Diamond, one of the ships in the Third Supply fleet of Sir Thomas Gates. =Death= In December 1609, Ratcliffe and 14 fellow colonists were invited to a gathering with the tribe of Powhatan Indians. The Powhatans promised the starving colonists would be given corn, but it was a trap. The colonists were ambushed. Ratcliffe suffered a particularly gruesome fate: he was tied to a stake in front of a fire. Women removed the skin from his entire body with mussel shells and tossed the pieces into the flame as he watched. They skinned his face last and finally burned him at the stake. This story was documented in an eyewitness account that is included in The Jamestown Adventure: Accounts of the Virginia Colony, 1605‚Äì1614 (Real Voices, Real History), edited by Ed Southern. In popular culture In Disney's Pocahontas (1995), Ratcliffe was portrayed as a greedy and ruthlessly ambitious man, and the film's main antagonist. His character believes that the Powhatan tribe is very barbaric in nature and have hidden gold near the outskirts of Virginia, and he wants to battle the Native Americans for them, despite the fact that there was never any gold in Virginia and that the tribe has their own type of society. Here, he was voiced by David Ogden Stiers. In this adaptation, he is accompanied by the pug Percy (this name derived from the English colonist George Percy) and by his servant Wiggins. He also appeared in the direct-to- video sequel Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998), where he plans to dupe King James I into allowing him into sending a large navy armada to initiate a genocide against the Powhatans by attempting to sabotage the diplomatic meetings between Pocahontas and the king. He is finally exposed for his incompetence and treachery and is imprisoned by King James.

Plot summary (revised edition) A series of adventures begins for the Hardy Boys and their friends Chet and Biff after they are invited to spend Christmas vacation on Cabin Island at the invitation of its owner, Elroy Jefferson, as a reward for recovering Jefferson's car in The Shore Road Mystery. While they are collecting the keys to the cabin from Mr. Jefferson they meet Mr. Hanleigh who is interested in purchasing the island. As well, Mr. Jefferson asks the Hardy boys to locate his grandson Johnny who has gone missing. As the boys try to enjoy themselves, someone seems determined to spoil their fun. First, two high school dropouts vandalize their loaded ice boat, the Sea Gull, which delays their departure for Cabin Island by a few hours. Once on the island, a ghost- like hooting leads to an innocent and humorous discovery. All their groceries are stolen, and so Frank and Joe head for the coast to purchase new supplies, but not long after, they find the original stock buried in snow. Chet sees a ghost walking through the woods, as well Mr. Hanleigh and the two high school dropouts are seen sneaking around the island, apparently searching for something. After a series of collisions and near misses with the Sea Gull, the Hardys learn that Mr. Hanleigh is the nephew of a former servant of Mr. Jefferson and he is looking for something hidden in the fireplace. A foreign dignitary, who was earlier mistaken for a ghost due to his white robes, reveals that he is seeking a medal that was presented to the grandfather of his nation's ruler, and had been misled by Mr. Hanleigh who was pretending to be Jefferson's representative. The Hardy boys find the missing medals hidden in the chimney and also locate Johnny, returning both to Mr. Jefferson who rewards them with a medal for each of them. Plot summary (original edition) While riding in their homemade iceboat on the frozen surface of Barmet Bay, Frank and Joe Hardy and Chet Morton discuss their plans for the upcoming Christmas holiday break, and decide to ask if they could rent out the namesake cabin on Cabin Island. However, a mysterious stranger chases them off the island, and on their return to shore, they nearly crash into an iceboat piloted by Ted Carson and Ike Nash, two reckless and obnoxious youths. The boys are later invited to the home of Elroy Jefferson, a man whose car they returned in The Shore Road Mystery, so he can reward them. They overhear an argument between Jefferson, the owner of Cabin Island, and a Mr. Hanleigh, who is constantly trying to buy the titular cabin for large sums of money. Mr. Jefferson initially tries to give them a monetary reward for returning his stolen Pierce Arrow (Jefferson was in Europe when the car was returned), but the boys ask if they can use his cabin for the holidays, which Mr. Jefferson grants them permission for. As time goes by on the island, the boys notice that strange things have been going on, most notably the disappearance of their supplies. Frank and Joe head to a village on the mainland to get more supplies, and end up talking to a storekeeper named Amos Grice. Grice tells the boys that Jefferson had once married a woman who would inherit the valuable Bender stamp collection from her father, and that rumor has it that Jefferson really married her for the stamps, which were turned over to Elroy when she did inherit them. Jefferson built the cabin years ago for his late wife and son to use in the summer, but while it was being constructed the stamp collection vanished along with their servant, John Sparewell, and Mrs. Jefferson died shortly thereafter. It is later revealed that after Sparewell was almost caught with the stamps, he went to Cabin Island to try to return the stamps in secret. However, he hid them in a gap in the chimney, intending to retrieve them the next day, but the gap was mortared up, sealing them up forever. Before Sparewell died, he willed the box of stamps to his nephew, Mr. Hanleigh, with the instructions to return it to Jefferson. Hanleigh had been trying to buy the island and prowl around it to recover the stamps, but never intended to give them back to Jefferson. Neither Hanleigh nor the boys were able to find the stamps, but when a violent storm tears the cabin apart, the box of stamps is miraculously recovered.

Created by Akira Toriyama, she first appeared in Chapter #11 of the Dragon Ball manga entitled \\"...And into the Fire!\\" Typically portrayed as the shrewish wife of series protagonist Son Goku and the overprotective mother of Son Gohan and Son Goten, Chi-Chi is considered to be one of the most prominent female characters in the franchise, and is featured consistently in merchandise and in cosplay by Dragon Ball fandom. She is voiced by Mayumi Sh≈ç in the Japanese version of the series up until Dragon Ball Z episode 88, from which point she is voiced by Naoko Watanabe. In the Funimation English dub, she is voiced by Laura Bailey as a child and Cynthia Cranz as an adult. In the Ocean dub, she was voiced by Andrea Libman as a child and by Laara Sadiq and Lisa Ann Beley respectively as an adult. Conception  Chi-Chi's name is derived from many language translations by Toriyama; besides being a pun for \\"milk\\", it also happens to be a slang term for female breasts or urine in Latin America. Her original swimsuit style costume was based on an costume earlier manga character from the same creator called Pola from Pola & Roid. Toriyama had expressed disdain for the character in a 2003 interview, and claimed that drawing her is a \\"punishment\\".  Appearances  =Dragon Ball= Chi-Chi first appears as an unnamed child running away from a dinosaur, which she later decapitates with a blade attachment on her helmet. After an awkward encounter with Yamcha, she later meets Goku, who offered her to ride with him on his flying nimbus cloud. When Goku ignorantly patted Chi-Chi's crotch with his foot to determine her gender, she instinctively reacted by smacking Goku, but then became bashful and believed that Goku liked her. Chi-Chi and Goku‚Äôs interactions would continually display Goku‚Äôs naivety about love and emotions; Chi-Chi tells Goku that when she becomes older, he will be the person to take her hand in marriage, to which he agrees, thinking that \\"marriage\\" was a kind of food. She would meet Goku again at the beginning of the Red Ribbon Army Saga, when he would visit her to search for one of the Dragon Balls, which at the time was being sought by both Emperor Pilaf and Colonel Silver of the Red Ribbon Army. Years later, Chi-Chi resurfaced as a competitor at the 23rd Tenka'ichi Bud√¥kai martial arts tournament and kept her identity concealed. Chi-Chi is angry that Goku had never come back to keep his promise to marry her, which he had completely forgotten about. They eventually faced each other in a tournament match; after winning the match, Goku is shocked to realize that his opponent was in fact Chi-Chi, who had grown up as he had. Being a good-natured man, Goku decides to keep his promise of settling down with Chi-Chi, and publicly announces that he will marry her. In the anime-only filler conclusion to the Dragon Ball TV series, they would go on several adventures to retrieve a magical fan in order to put out the fire on Chi-Chi's mountain home to save her father. By the end of the original Dragon Ball series, she and Goku are married. =Dragon Ball Z= Chi-Chi's role in the succeeding Dragon Ball Z series revolves around her status as Goku's wife and mother to their son, Son Gohan, and later, Son Goten. She demonstrates behavior typical of a helicopter parent, and is adamant that her children, Gohan in particular, prioritize academic pursuits and stays away from Goku's lifestyle of fighting and constant conflict. She often becomes frustrated whenever Gohan is encouraged to hone his fighting skills or is drawn to a fight, so much that often Chi-Chi is willing to go to battle herself to defend her son. Under her influence, Gohan worked hard to develop a career path as an academic scholar. She is widowed after Goku sacrifices his life to stop Cell from destroying the world, and would go on to raise Gohan and Goten, the latter being born shortly after the events of the Cell Saga arc, as a single mother. During the Buu Saga arc, Chi-Chi's parenting style is depicted as not being as strict with Goten and a now teenaged Gohan, though she is still very protective of her children. She initially disapproved Gohan training Videl, misunderstanding that the two were dating. However, her mind changes drastically when she learns that Videl lives with a rich family, encouraging Gohan to marry her. Along with the family members and associates of the Dragon Team, she was relocated to Kami's Lookout after Majin Buu was unleashed and went on a rampage throughout the world. When she learned of Gohan's apparent death at the hands of Buu, Chi-Chi takes the news badly. She confronts Buu when he arrives at Kami's hideout, scolding and slapping the creature out of anger for the lives he has taken; Buu retaliates by turning her into an egg and crushing her. Chi Chi and everyone else who had died at Buu's hand are wished back to life at the end of the storyline, and is happily reunited with her husband, who has been brought back to life in order to defeat Buu. By the end of Dragon Ball Z, Chi-Chi becomes a grandmother to Pan and mother-in-law to Videl, who ended up marrying Gohan. Chi-Chi appears in multiple Dragon Ball films which carry the Dragon Ball Z branding, often in minor supporting roles which provide comic relief. =Dragon Ball GT= Chi- Chi plays a minor role in the Dragon Ball GT series. She mostly associates with Bulma and Videl, while also supporting her family in times of crisis. Goku is turned into a child at the beginning of the series, which frustrates her, but she still cares for him deeply. Chi-Chi, along with nearly the entire population on Earth, is later possessed by Baby, but later cured with the sacred water. She is last seen with Goku, when he says goodbye to everyone and departs the mortal world with Shenron. =Dragon Ball Super= Chi-Chi's appearances in the Dragon Age Super series continue to be defined by her relationships with her husband and sons. She often reminds Goku that he has a responsibility to provide for his family as a husband and a father, and continually nags him about getting a job and earning more money. While she still tries to keep everyone in her family away from physical violence, she appears to accept that fighting is in a Saiyan‚Äôs nature and that conflict is sometimes unavoidable. =In other media= Chi-Chi is portrayed by Jamie Chung in the American live-action film Dragonball Evolution; her voice was dubbed over by Ami Koshimizu in the Japanese version of the film. Chi-Chi usually appears as a non-playable character in cut scenes or is referenced in dialogue for most Dragon Ball video games. She is a support-type character for Goku and Gohan in Dragon Ball Z: Harukanaru Densetsu. Chi-Chi is a playable character in 2006's Super Dragon Ball Z; her appearance is derived from her time as a competitor at the 23rd Tenka'ichi Bud√¥kai martial arts tournament. The child version of Chi-Chi is playable in Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3, while both adult and youth versions are playable in Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle. She appears as an enemy character in Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo, Dragon Ball Z: Super Gokuden: Kakusei-Hen, Dragon Ball Z: Goku Hish≈çden and Dragon Ball: Origins. In Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot, Chi-Chi appears as one of several cooks that can cook meals for the playable characters using various recipes and ingredients acquired through gameplay. Reception Chi-Chi is commonly cited as an \\"irritating\\" character by the fanbase and is commonly stereotyped as being \\"loud\\" and \\"angry\\", though some media outlets believed that the character had potential based on her early appearances; she was originally depicted as a tough lady fighter, but she was later developed as a stereotypical housewife and nagging mother archetype. Monique Jones from Syfy identified the cause of the character's negative reception to Toriyama's lack of interest in the proper character development of female characters. She has been cited as the \\"responsible adult\\" who introduces a sense of maturity to the franchise along with being portrayed as \\"headstrong\\". Chi-Chi had also been described as \\"misunderstood\\" by fans in popular culture media, and that she is in fact a positive role model for feminism. Her original appearance as a child wearing a revealing two piece swimsuit costume was scrutinized by critics for not being age appropriate.

Biography Petrov-Popa was a Soviet army veteran of the war in Afghanistan who was convicted together with four other men in the so-called Ila»ôcu Group for acts of terrorism including assassination by the separatist authorities of Transnistria. The trials in 1993 were considered by many human rights groups as unfair and lacking in due process.

It is located approximately to the south of modern-day Minya in the region known as Middle Egypt, the area between Asyut and Memphis.Baines, John, and Jaromir Malek. Cultural Atlas Of Ancient Egypt. Revised Edition ed. Oxfordshire, England: Andromeda Oxford Limited, 2000 While there are some Old Kingdom burials at the site, it was primarily used during the Middle Kingdom, spanning the 21st to 17th centuries BCE (Middle Bronze Age).Robins, Gay. The Art Of Ancient Egypt. Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1997 To the south of the cemetery is a temple constructed by Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, dedicated to the local goddess Pakhet. It is known as the Cave of Artemis, because the Greeks identified Pakhet with Artemis, and the temple is subterranean. Cemetery Provincial governors in the Middle Kingdom continued to be buried in decorated rock-cut tombs in their local cemeteries, carried over from the First Intermediate Period, at sites such as Beni Hasan. There is evidence of a re-organization of the system of government during the 12th Dynasty. During the First Intermediate Period and for some of the Middle Kingdom period it was common for Nomarchs (someone who oversees/controls a government specified area) to be hereditary positions; the elite did not depend on the king to legitimize their power as much as they had in the Old Kingdom. In the 12th Dynasty the power of the Nomarchs began to be curtailed, and provincial governors were appointed or at least confirmed by the king. There are 39 ancient tombs here of Middle Kingdom (ca. 21st to 19th centuries BCE) nomarchs of the Oryx nome, who governed from Hebenu. Due to the quality of, and distance to the cliffs in the west, these tombs were constructed on the east bank. There is a spatial distribution in this cemetery (there are two cemeteries here: the upper range and the lower necropolis) associated with the different levels of resources available to the deceased; the most important people were buried near the top of the cliff.Richards, Janet. Society And Death In Ancient Egypt. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge UP, 2005 In the lower cemetery there are 888 shaft tombs, dating to the Middle Kingdom, that were excavated by John Garstang; for the most part these tombs shared a similar general design which included a small chamber or recess at the foot of the shaft (facing south) to receive the coffin and the funeral deposits.Garstang, John. The Burial Customs of Ancient Egypt. London, England: Archibald Constable & Co Ltd, 1907 In the upper cemetery members of the elite class built striking tombs to represent their social and political positions as the rulers and officials of the Oryx Nome, which is the 16th Nome of Upper Egypt. At this site, the provincial high elite were buried in large and elaborately decorated tombs carved into the limestone cliffs near the provincial capital, located in the upper cemetery area. These tombs lie in a row on a north-south axis. There is a slight break in the natural rock terrace, on to which they open, that divides the thirty-nine high status tombs into two groups.Kamrin, Janice. The Cosmos of Khnumhotep II at Beni Hasan. London, England: Kegan Paul International, 1999. The basic design of these elite tombs was an outer court and a rock-cut pillared room (sometimes referred to as the chapel) in which there was a shaft that led to the burial chamber. Some of the larger tombs have biographical inscriptions and were painted with scenes of daily life and warfare. They are famous for the quality of their paintings. Nowadays, many of these scenes are in poor condition, though in the 19th century copies were made of several of them.Bard, Kathryn A. An Introduction To The Archaeology Of Ancient Egypt. Oxford, United Kingdom: Blackwell Ltd, 2008 Notable tombs Detail of the wrestling scenes in tomb 15. Four out of the 39 tombs are accessible to the public. Notable tombs are: *Tomb 2 - Amenemhat, known as Ameny, nomarch under Senusret I (accessible). *Tomb 3 - Khnumhotep II, notable for the depiction of caravans of Semitic traders (accessible). *Tomb 4 - Khnumhotep IV, nomarch during the late 12th Dynasty (closed). *Tomb 13 - Khnumhotep, royal scribe during the 12th Dynasty (closed). *Tomb 14 - Khnumhotep I, nomarch under Amenemhat I (closed). *Tomb 15 - Baqet III, notable for the depiction of wrestling techniques (accessible). *Tomb 17 - Khety, nomarch during the 11th Dynasty, son of Baqet; notable for depiction of what may be ball games (accessible). *Tomb 21 - Nakht, nomarch during the 12th Dynasty (closed). *Tomb 23 - Netjernakht, overseer of the Eastern Desert during the 12th dynasty (closed). *Tomb 27 - Ramushenti, nomarch during the 11th Dynasty (closed). *Tomb 29 - Baqet I, nomarch during the 11th Dynasty (closed). *Tomb 33 - Baqet II, nomarch during the 11th Dynasty (closed).

This book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Leslie McFarlane in 1931. Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter.The Hardy Boys Online: Revisions The original version of this book was rewritten in 1967 by Tom Mulvey resulting in two different stories with the same title. Plot summary (revised edition) Joe and Frank are asked by their father Fenton Hardy to break into the house of a scientist and retrieve a secret invention and keep it safe from being stolen while he is away. The brothers successfully retrieve the device while at the same time thwarting an attempted burglary. The device turns out to be a small transistor-type radio with remarkably clear reception; their father sends a message to guard it carefully, so they hide it in the trunk of their car. The next day at an antique airplane show, Chet steps on the toe of a blonde-haired man who becomes angry but flees when an onlooker states that the man was trying to eavesdrop on their conversation. Later, the brothers see the blonde man, who accidentally dumps his briefcase contents when fleeing them. From here the plot parallels in many ways the original plot, with minor changes and updates. At a party at Chet's later that night, the boys observe someone snooping around their car. Joe goes to investigates and disappears as the clock strikes midnight. As in the original, Frank and Chet search for Joe, but the trail eventually grows cold until a tip from Aunt Gertrude (of all people) leads to the caves along the bay off Shore Road. In this version, the bad guys are recast as both jewel smugglers and electronic thieves. The New York sequence follows much as in the original version as well, although in 1967 the Hardys are less shy about calling family for help and thus do not have to hitch-hike back to Bayport after being robbed. Once the boys are back to Bayport, they find the gang's head honcho is working at the local jewelry store, and as in the original version they follow him to the airport. The use of bi-planes in the original is maintained in the new version by the device of having the Hardys contact an acquaintance who has an antique plane to help them chase Taffy Marr. Their parachute escape from the plummeting biplane, one of the dramatic set-pieces of the original version, is thus maintained in the new book. As in the first book, Marr and the rest of the gang are rounded up late at night on the beach trying to bring in a load of hot diamonds. Plot summary (original edition) This story opens with Chet Morton giving the Hardy boys and their chums a lesson on how to use the new automat which just opened in their hometown of Bayport. While jostling one another the boys bump into a blonde haired man. Later, while wrestling with the boys from Crabb Corners, Joe Hardy falls against the blonde man again causing him to drop his package which is later revealed to contain diamonds he is smuggling. That evening the Hardy boys attend a party at the Morton's farm. While the clock is striking midnight Joe Hardy disappears without a trace. At first Frank thinks his brother is playing a joke on him but when he does not reappear Frank gets worried. A while later Frank and his chums manage to locate Joe who has been kidnapped and kept hostage in a cave along the Shore Road. The rest of the story deals with Frank and Joe traveling to New York City to unravel the mystery of the blonde man. In New York they are pick pocketed and have to spend a night sleeping in a park, while listening to the clock strike midnight. While hitchhiking back from New York, the boys meet two Department of Justice men who are investigating a case of diamond smuggling. When they return to Bayport the Hardy brothers locate who they believe to be Taffy Marr, the diamond smuggler. The Hardy boys chase him to the airport and then hire a plane to continue the chase, however the plane they hired has mechanical problems and crashes. After again returning to Bayport they locate Taffy Marr again, and send a message for the Department of Justice men to come and help them make the arrest. Together with help from the Department of Justice men, the Hardy brothers manage to arrest Taffy Marr and the men he's been working with. The story concludes with an informal party at the Morton's farm again, with the boys recounting their adventures for their friends, while the clock strikes midnight again.

He is well known in the Philippines for his close friendship with the writer and Propagandist Jos√© Rizal, and the numerous correspondence between the two provide a vital reference for Rizal historians and scholars,Rizal-Blumentritt Friendship, Austrian-Philippine Website including his last letter from prison before the execution. Biography Blumentritt was born in Prague (now the Czech Republic, then the capital of Kingdom of Bohemia in the former Austrian Empire). Blumentritt wrote extensively about the Philippines, although he never visited the islands, corresponding with the then Filipino student and writer Jos√© Rizal, who later became a national hero. Blumentritt's relationship with Rizal began as early as July 1886. Blumentritt became one of Rizal's closest confidants although they met only once. He translated a chapter of the latter's first book, Noli Me Tangere, into German and wrote the preface to Rizal's second book, El filibusterismo, although he was against its publication as he believed that it would lead to Rizal's death. These two novels are commentaries disguised as fiction which angered both the Catholic Church and the Spanish colonial government, and which eventually led to Rizal's 1896 trial and execution. Before the execution in Manila, Rizal wrote his final letter for Blumentritt. Blumentritt reportedly cried after receiving the letter. Alongside Rizal, Blumentritt was a significant contributor to the publication La Solidaridad, published by Filipino expatriates from 1889 to 1895 as a voice for advocacy of political reforms in the Philippines. From 1900, Blumentritt was a member of the Berlin Society for Anthropology. Blumentritt died in Litomƒõ≈ôice (), Bohemia. He is memorialized in the Philippines by numerous public parks and streets. Among them are Blumentritt Road, Blumentritt station (Line 1), Blumentritt railway station, the Blumentritt Market in Metro Manila and the Blumentritt Street in Naga City and Tuguegarao. His relations with Rizal also caused the twin status of the Czech town of Litomƒõ≈ôice with the Philippine towns of Calamba (Rizal's birthplace) and Dapitan (where Rizal was initially exiled).

This book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Leslie McFarlane in 1932. Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter. The Hardy Boys Online: Revisions The original version of this book was rewritten in 1962 by James Buechler resulting in two different stories with the same title. The original-text edition was the last book to be released in the red binding before Grosset & Dunlap switched to a brown binding in mid-1932. Plot =Original edition= When Raymond Dalrymple starts to receive death threats he seeks help from Fenton Hardy; however Mr. Hardy is out of town so Frank and Joe offer to help. Mr. Dalrymple did not want to give the Hardy boys the case, instead telling them to investigate the old Purdy house out on the Shore Road. While walking on the shore road they are almost hit by a big touring car with the curtains down; they then meet a motorcycle cop who was chasing the car which supposedly carried river thieves. The next day Mr. Dalrymple returned, having decided to let the Hardy boys take the case. He explains that he recently purchased the Purdy house and had been using a secret safe room there to find solitude; however he had received death threats delivered to the secret room while it was securely locked. The Hardy boys explore the Purdy house that night and see a man who looks like Mr. Dalrymple enter the house before they hear screams coming from the house and meet Hurd Applegate, whom the boys met while solving The Tower Treasure mystery, running from the house. Mr. Applegate is too excited to explain what he was doing there, so the Hardy boys have to go back and explore the home another day. Upon further exploration they find an unused wing of the home which has recently had locks added to the doors. The police are called who find the locked rooms filled with stolen goods, stolen by the river thieves. While the police thought this resolved the case, the Hardy boys kept an eye on the Purdy house and found a stranger coming to the house, who then runs away after another scream is heard. While investigating the house again the Hardy boys are taken hostage by a crazy old man named Amos and another man who looks almost exactly like Mr. Dalrymple. Surprisingly they are rescued by Mr. Applegate and a bomb, which was attached to the ticking grandfather clock, is safely disarmed. Mr. Dalrymple arrives with the police and Amos falls to his death while trying to escape. The Hardy boys examine the device he was using and solve the mystery of how he managed to deliver the death threats to the secret room, as well they locate stamps which Mr. Dalrymple's doppelg√§nger had stolen from Mr. Applegate. =Revised edition= A banker named Raymond Dalrymple of Lakeside gets death threats and shows up at the Hardy house, seeking Fenton Hardy's assistance. Frank and Joe offer to help and he reluctantly agrees. Soon after that, during a hike with their friends, the Hardy boys are nearly run over by a car. They then investigate Purdy place. After that, they rest and talk over their recent misadventures. Another stormy exploration of the mansion reveals a man resembling Dalrymple enter the house. Suddenly, a light goes on in the house, followed by a man's scream. This later proved to be an elderly man named Hurd Applegate, a friend of the Hardy boys. He tells them of the theft of his valuable jade collection. Further sleuthing reveals that the thefts are performed in well-known speedboats such as the Hardy's Sleuth. Shortly after, Dalrymple disappears and the Hardys, fearing for their lives, go to the Purdy place to look for him. Then the Hardys are held up by a man named Arthur Jensen, looking similar to Dalrymple, living in his house secretly in hiding. Jensen was a thief who stole small, but valuable things from ships and such. Frank and Joe are bound and gagged, along with an inventor named Amos Wandy, with a time bomb set to go off at 3 a.m. With less than two minutes remaining, a window panel breaks and Chet Morton emerges and unbinds Frank, who then defuse the bomb just seconds before it was supposed to go off. Joe and Wandy are unbound next. Then Jensen is later caught on the Purdy mansion grounds and the valuables are retrieved. Another discovery proves that the death threats to Raymond Dalyrmple are lowered down through the chimney in the jaws of one of Amos Wandy's inventions, which rolls to the middle of the hidden room, then drops the note and is raised up by a wire. At the end, Dalrymple throws a surprise party for the boys and gives Mr. Wandy permission to stay in the hidden room and invent whenever he wants.

Plot =Revised edition= Frank and Joe attempt to uncover a plot to smuggle refugees from Baredo in the Huellas (a fictional island nation off the coast of French Guiana) into the United States, and the involvement of local magnate Orrin North. They also get involved with investigating attempts to spy on a top-secret satellite camera being built at a local company called Micro-Eye. Someone has managed to infiltrate security at the plant and has taken photos of blueprints. Realizing that several clues point to the involvement of people from Baredo, Frank and Joe and their friend Chet Morton fly down to Cayenne, French Guiana, and then go by boat to Baredo in the nearby Huellas to investigate. What they discover is that Orrin North, while supposedly on the side of rebels against the dictator of Baredo, is actually double-crossing the rebels by finding out their identities and capturing them. Returning to Bayport, the boys overhear a plot to steal the satellite camera the very next day, but they are captured and taken aboard a ship where they are locked into a hold being filled with water. They manage to escape from the hold with the assistance of their father, Fenton Hardy, who has been on the same case and went after this ship at the same time. They free the political prisoners on board, stop the theft at Micro-Eye, and capture the criminals with the assistance of the Coast Guard. =Original edition= When Frank and Joe try to take their laundry to the laundromat in order to clean up the house before Aunt Gertrude arrives, they learn that its owner has disappeared and has been replaced by a sinister Chinaman named Louie Fong. Later that day, the boys go down to the docks to meet their aunt, who mysteriously does not show up. While waiting, they meet a man who introduces himself as Sidney Pebbles, who gets locked into a telephone booth and, out of pity, is invited to spend the night at the Hardy home. The next morning, Mr. Pebbles has disappeared, along with some papers from Fenton Hardy's coat pockets, leaving only a set of footprints below the window. That night, they arrive home to find Aunt Gertrude on the floor, ill. She had accidentally overslept and had to arrive on the return voyage, making her a day late. Concerned, they hire a nurse, Mrs. Cody, to take care of her while she recovers. In the following days, the Hardy boys investigate a fight amongst Chinamen at the local docks, as well as meeting Orrin North, who had hired their father to clear his company name under accusations that he is involved in smuggling Chinamen into America to avoid a head tax. Later, the boys and Orrin North head to a Chinese restaurant named \\"Lantern Land\\" where Sidney Pebbles is working. To their surprise, a Sidney Pebbles is working there, with the same face but is not the same man. They overhear Pebbles talking to Tom Wat, a Chinese man who was stabbed in the dock fight, but miraculously survived, when someone releases a dog to attack Tom. The Hardy boys intervene and save the pair, also trying to help Tom and Sidney. During the course of their investigation, the Hardy boys hide Tom Wat by dressing him up as a woman and hiding him in their home. They also meet the real Mr. Pebbles and realize that they had been fooled by an imposter who lied to them in order to get into their house. The story concludes with the Hardy boys being held prisoner along with their father, until Tom Wat is able to escape and get help, resulting in the people smugglers being arrested and the Hardy boys solving the mystery of who left the footprints under the window - Fenton Hardy.

Although it is generally believed that the force left from Gesoriacum (Boulogne), it is possible that part of the fleet sailed from near the mouth of the Rhine. And while Rutupi√¶ (Richborough, on the east coast of Kent) is often stated as the site of the landing (e.g. by Sheppard Frere),Sheppard Frere (1967), Britannia: A History of Roman Britain, Routledge and Kegan Paul, London there are equally plausible arguments in favour of a landing further west along the south coast of Britain. The only contemporary detailed account of the invasion comes from Cassius Dio's Roman History,Cassius Dio, Roman History 60:19-22 written in the early 3rd century. He states that the main invasion force under Aulus Plautius sailed in three divisions, and George Patrick WelchGeorge Patrick Welch (1963), Britannia: the Roman Conquest and Occupation of Britain argues that there were three landing sites in Kent: Lympne furthest west (the Legio II Augusta under Vespasian), Dover in the centre (the Legio XX Valeria Victrix under an unknown commander) and Richborough in the east (the IX Hispana and XIV Gemina under the overall command of Plautius). The three divisions would have then advanced from the coast and met at the River Medway. Other historians dispute that the Romans landed in Kent. Dio describes how the troops saw a shooting star whilst at sea and were cheered by this omen. He adds that it travelled from east to west and that this was the direction the Romans were sailing in. However, a voyage from Boulogne to Kent sails from south to north. Taking Boulogne as the point of departure, historians such as John MorrisJohn Morris (1982), Londinium: London in the Roman Empire and J. G. F. HindJ G F Hind (1989), The Invasion of Britain in AD 43, Britannia, 20, 1-21 have used Dio's account to suggest a landing point much further west along the south coast of Britain, around the Solent or Southampton Water. This is supported by Dio's stated reason for the Roman invasion, that Verica, the king of the Atrebates who lived in the area of modern-day Hampshire, had appealed for Roman assistance after he was expelled in a coup, and by Suetonius's assertion that Vespasian conquered the Isle of Wight.Suetonius, Vespasian 4 Similarly Dio writes of an early victory when the Romans received the surrender of a tribe he calls the \\"Bodunni\\". No tribe of this name is known, but it is very similar to that of the Dobunni who occupied Gloucestershire. In this case, a landing point in the region of Chichester or Portsmouth might be expected. The remains of military storehouses dating to the appropriate period have been found under Fishbourne Roman Palace, a 1st-century Roman villa near Chichester and, on the basis of this, and other archaeological evidence, archaeologist Barry Cunliffe, formerly a proponent of the Kent hypothesis, has stated that he was becoming persuaded by the arguments in favour of a South Coast landing.Barry Cunliffe (1998), Fishbourne Roman Palace, Tempus, Stroud, p 21 Other historians argue that, as the Roman invasion fleet may have numbered as many as 1,000 ships, mostly slow and ungainly troop transports, its commanders would have wanted to minimise the time spent at sea because of the risk of contrary winds, and that this favours the short route to Kent rather than the longer journey up the Channel to the Solent. Richborough had a large natural harbour (long since silted up) which would have provided a suitable anchorage for the landing (though its capacity to hold more than a small part of the fleet has been questioned),E W Black (2000), \\"Sentius Saturninus and the Roman Invasion of Britain\\", Britannia, 31, 1-10 and there are archaeological remains of earthworks, interpreted as defensive ditches, dug to protect the anchorage, dating to the period of the invasion. There is also evidence at Richborough of a ceremonial arch, which may have commemorated Richborough's role in the invasion, but as the arch was not constructed until c AD 80, by which time Rutupi√¶ was the major port of entry into Britain from the continent, its relation to the events of the invasion is uncertain. The British defence was led by Caratacus and Togodumnus of the Catuvellauni, an eastern kingdom with influence over Kent, and the Romans' immediate objective seems to have been to secure a crossing of the River Thames in order to reach the territory of the Catuvellauni. The Dobunni, who Dio says were tributaries of the Catuvellauni, could have sent troops eastwards to their aid, who then surrendered to Plautius in Kent. In this scenario, Vespasian's western conquests could have taken place after the Thames crossing was secured. According to Suetonius, Claudius sailed from Boulogne,Suetonius, Claudius 17 and it is usually assumed that the main force under Plautius sailed from the same place, but it is possible that Plautius's forces sailed from the mouth of the Rhine, which Strabo names as a point of departure used for crossings to Britain in the early 1st century; ships commonly sailed along the coast of Belgic Gaul to the territory of the Morini, before taking a relatively short open-sea crossing to Britain.Strabo, Geography 4:5.2 This would account for the westward journey in Dio's account. On the other hand, if the Rhine was the point of departure, and if the Catuvellauni were Plautius's objective, it could be argued that a landing south of the Thames would have been unnecessary and have entailed as much risk as a landing north of the river. The three divisions mentioned by Dio also leave open the possibility that, while the main landing was in Kent, part of the force sailed to the Solent to aid Verica, or vice versa. Dio, of course, wrote about 150 years after the event, and his sources are unknown; the details of his account are uncorroborated and may be unreliable.

The original story contained racial stereotypes which were removed during the revision. For example, the chief villain, a young black man named Luke Jones is described in the 1935 edition as \\"the worst scoundrel we have ever come across\\", but is completely removed from the 1961 version, and most characters identifiable as black have been reworked as racially ambiguous. Plot summary (revised edition) The Hardy boys meet Mr. Bart Worth who is the editor of the Larchmont Record. He explains that Mr. Samuel Blackstone has sued him for printing a story accusing his ancestors of being pirates. Mr. Worth also tells the Hardy boys about the long-standing feud between the Blackstone and the Rand families over ownership of a pond in Hidden Harbor. The Hardy boys accept Mr. Worth‚Äôs case and, along with their friend Chet Morton, drive to Georgia. Once they have set up a camp on the beach between the two properties, the boys begin to investigate the Rand and Blackstone estates. They are surprised to find a ‚Äòsea monster‚Äô in the pond and to witness Mr. Rand being hit over the head with a vase by Mr. Blackstone, only moments later to find the vase intact and Mr. Rand missing. Despite the efforts of their enemies, the Hardy boys manage to find Mr. Rand and recover a treasure chest containing historical records which prove that the accusations Mr. Worth made in his article were all true. The feud is settled when Mr. Rand and Mr. Blackstone decide to work together to harvest the valuable cypress trees from Hidden Harbor. Plot summary (original edition) The story begins with the Hardy boys and their pal Chet Morton returning to Bayport on a small coast liner from Larchmont where they had procured handwriting samples from Miss Pennyweather for a case on which their father, Fenton Hardy, was working. During a storm, they meet Mr. Samuel Blackstone who tells the boys that he is carrying a large sum of money. Shortly thereafter, the ship runs aground and Mr. Blackstone is knocked down by Mr. Luke Jones and badly hurt. Joe and Chet manage to swim to shore but Frank Hardy goes missing as he stayed behind to assist the injured Mr. Blackstone. Shortly after Frank is located, the three boys are arrested on charges of robbing Mr. Blackstone. The Hardy boys immediately suspect Mr. Ruel Rand of robbing Mr. Blackstone and set out to track him down. Recording the license plate of a car that they see him get into, they learn he lives in Hidden Harbor. The Hardy boys visit the wreck of the Resolute where they attempt to retrieve the handwriting samples. However, their boat drifts off and they are detained by the Coast Guard before they are able to reach their stateroom. After returning to land, they are questioned by the district attorney at Mr. Blackstone‚Äôs bedside. There they learn about the long-standing feud between the Blackstones and the Rands. Chet and the Hardy boys travel south to Hidden Harbor to retrieve new handwriting samples from Miss Pennyworth as well as to investigate who stole Mr. Blackstone‚Äôs money. While there, they are followed by a detective and their campsite is vandalized. They also stumble across a ‚Äòsecret society‚Äô of young black men being led by Luke Jones, a servant to Mr. Blackstone. This group of Negroes kidnaps Mr. Rand‚Äôs mentally insane brother who manages to turn the tables on them by stealing their revolvers. Eventually the Hardy boys manage to find and disarm the brother as well as capture Luke Jones and make him confess to stealing Mr. Blackstone‚Äôs money and his diamond ring as well as being responsible for inciting more hatred between the two families. The Hardy boys also manage to gather indisputable evidence which solves their father‚Äôs case without the need for replacement handwriting samples.

Plot Summary (revised edition) This story begins with Frank and Joe Hardy driving home along Shore Road when they have an accident with a dragster. After they arrive home their father, Fenton Hardy, tells them about a new case he has taken on for Alden Automotive Research and Development Company, with which he would like the boys' help. Mr. Hardy explains that Mr. Alden believes someone is trying to steal the plans for a secret new engine he is designing, and that two of his racing cars which were equipped with new engine had strange accidents in which their windshields suddenly \\"crazed\\" (turned an opaque white), just after passing a road sign warning ‚ÄúDANGER‚Äù. While they are discussing the case, someone fires a smoke grenade into their house with a warning attached, telling them to \\"drop the Alden case\\". Frank and Joe start by working undercover at Alden‚Äôs shop, while their friend Chet Morton takes an interest in jet propelling his bicycle, which leads to humorous results. At the shop the boys meet Barto Sigor and they learn that he has a twin brother Vilno who recently quit Alden‚Äôs employment. The boys immediately suspect that the twins may have swapped spots so that Vilno can gain access to the plans for the new motor. The Hardy boys also meet Roger Alden, Mr. Alden‚Äôs son, who seems to have a bad attitude. He is the boys' second suspect. Aunt Gertrude receives news that she has just inherited a farm for retired racing horses. She is horrified at the prospect of owning such a thing, but before she can sell it the Hardy boys go to see the place. When they return they find that Mr. Alden‚Äôs racehorse Topnotch has been stolen and is being held for ransom. The Hardy boys return to the farm where they meet with Fowler, the manager of the farm, who tells them to get lost. While there, Frank picks up a cartridge from Fowler‚Äôs rifle, which he later matches to the rifle casing used to shoot the smoke grenade into the Hardy home. It is later revealed that Fowler is actually Norman Dodson, and is responsible for the theft of Topnotch. Using their detective skills, the Hardy boys figure out where the horse is being kept. They go there, get captured, but manage to escape while riding Topnotch to freedom. Returning to the Alden automotive case, they learn that Barto has fled the plant with Mr. Alden's experimental race car. The Hardy boys eventually figure out where Barto is hiding, but when they reach the mansion hideout, they are suddenly \\"frozen in their tracks\\" by a \\"powerful invisible force\\". Once captured they find their father has also been trapped, along with Mr. Alden and his son Roger. While they are being held hostage Vilno brags to the boys about his \\"sonic trap\\" which can trap objects inside using \\"hypersonic vibrations\\" and he explains how he used his \\"hypersonic generator\\" to craze the windshields of the race cars. Once Vilno leaves Joe manages to escape from the cabin through an air vent, where Chet Morton arrives on his rocket propelled bike, causing the villains to crash their car between two trees and trapping them inside until the police can arrive to arrest them. Plot summary (original edition) The Hardy boys plan to go for a football game in the Seneca grounds. While they are going, they experience shortage of petrol, and are asked by a man in a truck from Old Kentucky the directions to the racetracks. Shortly after giving the truck directions, the brothers hear a gunshot which they mark as suspicious. Despite the many setbacks the brothers encounter while going to the game, they reached just in time to see the opening kick-off. Frank is continuously bothered by a foreigner who introduces himself as Mr. Vilnoff, who doesn't understand the rules of football, and continues to pester the older Hardy lad into explaining the game to him. Frank tries losing the interrogator in the crowd, but he pops up again, right next to him, asking the self-same annoying questions. Frank is so pissed off by it all, he believes that the only plus-point of the day is that Bayport High emerges victorious. The next day, via Chet, the Hardys come to know that the famous racehorse, Topnotch, is missing. And, in the middle of the night, there was an explosion in the munitions factory near Renside. Frank has a hunch that the truck from Old Kentucky was the truck dropping clean out of sight. That afternoon, the Hardys decide to go to the races; however, they discover that their roadster was in need of repair which would not be fixed till later in the afternoon. They go to the races via bus and stop by the nearest refreshment stand, only to see that the man behind the counter was manipulating a timid old lady buying refreshments. After giving the lady the dollar the shopkeeper owed to her, they make inquiries under the grandstand about Topnotch, and the red- faced trainer they are questioning is convinced that Topnotch has been stolen. While roaming about, the brothers notice a child who looked friendless and forlorn. The Hardys bring him a kite to cheer him up, and they depart, happy that the kid is enjoying. However, they notice another man looking at the child, who introduces himself as Jockey Ivan, the owner of Topnotch. The boys use their detective skills to come to terms with the fact that the horse is being held for ransom. That very same day, Joe sees another machine swing in from the road and edge into the parking space, its bumper nudging one of the automobiles at the top of the incline. The brakes of the automobile had not been set, however, because that collision set the wheels of the automobile into the brink of the embankment. Slowly but surely, the auto starts heading down the slope, and to Joe's utter horror, it seems to be heading towards Vilnoff, Frank's only-too-annoying acquaintance from the previous day's game, and Ivan, the two of whom seem to be in a heated argument. Joe saves them by braking the automobile; however, the owner of the auto starts hurling accusations at the younger Hardy, who stands his ground, and with the help of Frank, thwarts him. During the course of the day, the brothers hear the affair discussed freely, but hear nothing of importance to them. They decide to investigate the route by which they'd reached the Seneca field, and they barely avoiding being hit by a speeding truck driver. The brothers, however, are sure the man in the backseat is Mr. Vilnoff. They investigate what's ahead, but give up as it gets dark. When they get home, their chum Chet Morton pulls up a joke on them by telling them they're wanted by the police. Mr. Hardy, a famous detective, decides to take his sons to Vilnoff's home for an alibi-check, where they learn that he is sailing for Europe in a few days. However, unlike Fenton Hardy, Frank and Joe don't trust Vilnoff, so they scan the outskirts of his home. There, they are caught by the gardener and chauffeur, but are let off by Vilnoff. Frank has a theory that Vilnoff deliberately sat by him because he knew he'd be questioned, and Joe agrees. He then pulls out what seems to be a clay model of a human hand, saying he picked it up before they scrammed. Aunt Gertrude tells the boys that Ivan had come to check on them. They decide to look him up, and in that excuse, they'd check the crossroads. When they reach the crossroads, Frank suggests they take a shortcut through the field, which involves climbing up a wooden fence. However, they don't escape scot-free, as the barbed wire pokes holes on their clothes, and a mad goat trails them out. They continue investigating the crossroads, and come across a placard which tells them to keep out because of shooting practice, but the Hardys decide to risk it. Here, they encounter a mad dog, who trees them like a coon, but from the tree, Frank sees the missing truck. They go over, and seeing the truck unoccupied, decide to investigate. But the hound keeps barking, thus bringing men over. The brothers are luckily not found, and they decide to investigate a bit more before giving up thanks to the darkness. While going to Bayport, they stop by a gas-station to eat something, but the hostile proprietor seems to want to get rid of them when a man in a green truck comes by. The brothers eavesdrop into their conversation. Frank jots down the plate-number of the green truck, which belongs to the proprietor's friend \\"Pete\\". When the bus to Bayport comes, the Hardys spot Ivan inside, who explains that the kidnappers left a ransom letter to owner of the Prescott stables, Mr. Prescott. The brothers and Ivan then receive a cryptic warning about staying away from the shady business. Later that day, at home, the brothers receive a threatening phone call that threatens them to stay away from the business. The next morning, Chet Morton's cousin arrives, and the Hardys go via boat with Chet to pick him up. Here, they see a speedboat passing them, and they are sure the man at the helm is Vilnoff. Bill Morton arrives, along with Fenton Hardy, who claims to have seen Vilnoff in the New York airport. Mr. Hardy tells his sons to notify the people from Quickshot Photos to click a picture of every passenger boarding the ship and forward the films to Mr. Hardy, which they do. While going home, they see the self-same proprietor of the gas-station waving to them for help. They give him the help he needs, only to see that the Sleuth has started to backfire. They ask for petrol, but halt when they see a bunch of men making multiple trips to the Bayport woods with briefcases. While investigating this, they get pegged to be normal teenagers who're gagged and tied up. They escape and go home. The next few days, they made no progress, but one day, Mr. Prescott called on the Hardy home, and the boys tell them about the truck they found. Mr. Prescott wants them to take him there, and they do - only to see the truck gone. The very same day, they decide to investigate the Vilnoff home, only to see that the home was protected with burglar alarms and they were caught. However, they resume their search, only for Joe to get electrocuted. He survives, but got shocked for a bit. After a little more investigation, they see a glowing torch get reflected towards a cave (the \\"sinister signpost\\") which they investigate. Here they learn that Vilnoff has destructive intentions regarding sabotaging the Spurtown races after the ransom is paid. It also turns up that Vilnoff has henchmen, and they are conspirating against the races too. After a long resistance, the bad guys are captured and sent to jail. The story ends with the Hardy brothers reading the will of Aunt Gertrude's distant relative, Jonathan Hood, who died in Kentucky two months ago. He had willed some of his property to Aunt Gertrude, and that he had left to Aunt Gertrude his only asset- a stable of race-horses.

Because of his poor performance at the lyc√©e, Friant requested permission to leave and focus on his art. His father agreed, and the young Friant was placed under the guide of a private tutor who would arrange his academic work so that time remained for painting.

Lawrence resulting in two different stories with the same title Plot summary (revised edition) While leaving the baseball field the Hardy boys are approached by a blind peddler with a warning for their father Fenton Hardy. Then the boys take their boat, the Sleuth out on Barmet Bay for a ride and to watch the testing of a new hydrofoil boat named the Sea Spook. While admiring the new boat they almost have a collision with it, allowing them a reason to board the boat where they find a glass eye, presumably belonging to Mr. Lambert who was test driving the boat when the near collision happened. When the boys try to track down Mr. Lambert he goes missing and Bill Braxton, the owner of the Sea Spook is attacked at his boathouse and the Spook is searched. Meanwhile, Fenton Hardy examines the warning from Henry Zatta, the blind peddler(who is really only just blind in one eye but is pretending to be blind because he is undercover), and declares that it must be warning them to keep away from the Goggler Gang. They then realize that Mr. Lambert is actually a hoodlum named Spotty Lemuel. Their discussion is interrupted by an old man at the door named Zachary Mudge who is staying at Doc Grafton's Health Farm, a luxurious resort overlooking Barmet Bay. Mr. Mudge tells them that he would like to purchase the Sea Spook. The boys decide to go to pick up their girlfriends Callie and Iola from a movie at the Bijou but as they arrive they see a man wearing the disguise of the Goggler Gang running away with the cashbox. They catch the man but he escapes before the police arrive. Later, the boys travel up the river in the ‚Äò‚Äôsleuth‚Äô‚Äô to speak to Mrs. Lunberry, the owner of a Jeweled Siva which was recently stolen, on behalf of their father who is going to take on the case. Upon returning they are summoned to Doc Grafton‚Äôs Health Farm by their chum Chet Morton, who has taken summer employment there. During the course of their travels they keep seeing suspicious vehicles, specifically brand new greenTorpedo sedans. When they get to the health farm Chet tells them that he has learned that someone is going to kidnap them and leaves them in suspense until Callie and Iola arrive and Chet says that they are kidnapping them to go to a beach party. The clue about the green Torpedo leads them to Izmir Motors, owned by Malcolm Izmir. The boys try to get to the door of Mr. Izmir‚Äôs house but are attacked by his guard dogs and have to climb a tree to escape. The butler finally comes outside and calls the dog and the Hardys get to talk to Malcolm Izmir who had been receiving threatening notes. Upon returning home they find their house has been burglarized and their fathers safe blown open and Aunt Gertude tied and gagged with a note that calls her a blabber mouth. They learn from Chief Collig that the Bijou holdup man was actually Nick Cordoza, and that he had broken into Mr. Izmir‚Äôs house, but Mr. Izmir had refused to press charges. The boys also learn from Mr. Mudge that the Izmir syndicate has gone broke. They also suspect that Doc. Grafton‚Äôs resort is actually a hideout for crooks who are getting plastic surgery to alter their looks, based on Chet‚Äôs report that he saw a mummy in an off-limits building on the Health Farm and their guess that Mr. Izmir is the head of the Goggler Gang because his name can be shortened to Mal I, which may mean ‚Äòevil eye‚Äô. Fenton Hardy goes undercover at the resort while Chet and the Hardy boys investigate by sneaking on to the Health Farm. They all end up captured by Spotty Lemuel and Rip Sinder. They are rescued when Chet calls the police, who arrest the villains and several other crooks that were staying at the Health Farm. Plot summary (original edition) The boys (Frank, Joe, and Chet) go see a movie called \\"A Figure in Hiding\\" at the local Rialto Theater. After the film is over, the Rialto is robbed, with the thief getting away with $900. Then the boys go to the Bayport Hotel and meet up with their father, Fenton Hardy. They spy on a pair of men (Rip Sinder and Spotty Lemuel) in the room next door, part of a cruel gang called the \\"Eye Syndicate\\", run by a bogus doctor named Grafton performing fraudulent eye operations on unsuspecting victims. While Sinder and Lemuel are preparing letters to prospective victims, Sinder's daughter barges in and begs him to come home. Lemuel, trying to get her to leave, reveals to her that she was adopted, something that Sinder had kept secret from her. This works and Virginia runs away in a fit of despair and sorrow. Not long after that, the police mistakenly arrest their friend Chet for the robbery. It was really committed by Nick Cordoza, whom the boys found in his car unconscious. Chet runs away to Boston instead of going back home, following directions from a note supposedly from the Hardy boyss to go there and wait for them. Later, their father devises a plan to trap Grafton by telling one of his clients (Henry Zatta) to pay with marked bills. However, the plan falls apart after Grafton recognizes his long lost father, causing him to flee and leave behind the $500 in marked money. Eventually, the boys find Virginia at an auto garage, where they attempt to prevent her from escaping, only to be caught in an auto accident. Grafton and his mute assistant Zeb find them and attempt to bury them alive but the Hardy boys fight them off. The boys are able to make it out of Grafton's cellar and the police show up to arrest the criminals. When the case is solved, Virginia is reunited with her grandmother, one of the victims of Grafton's fraudulent medical operations.

Lawrence resulting in two different stories with the same title. Plot =Revised edition= On a stormy night, the Hardy boys receive a visit from Captain Early who tells them the story of Red Rogers, the ‚ÄòJolly Roger‚Äô, and Whalebone Island, where he is said to haunt. The next day, the boys receive a map in the mail showing a red 'X' on Whalebone Island. They assume this is a treasure map so they, along with their friend Chet Morton, go to meet their father and explore the island. As they approach, they see the abandoned lighthouse flashing a warning to them in Morse code. On the island, they find their father who tells them about a solid gold bust of an Egyptian Pharaoh which was owned by Mr. Zufar. While it was being shipped to America aboard a freighter named Katawa, the ship sank and Mr. Zufar is making an insurance claim for one million dollars. However, the insurance company has received a tip that the head was not on the ship when it sank and Mr. Zufar is trying to defraud them. The Hardy boys end up on the salvage ship that is sent to search the Katawa, which happens to be sunk very close to Whalebone Island. While they are on board, they notice another salvage ship in the area as well. Once the diver is lowered to the sunken ship, he finds that someone else has already been there and stolen some of the ship‚Äôs equipment. On a later dive, the diver is nearly killed when a squid triggers a booby trap that was intended for him. The boys leave the salvage ship when they receive notice that their father has gone missing. They return to shore and locate their father and the missing Pharaoh‚Äôs head and put a stop to a plan by Mr. Zufar to sell the real head while also collecting the insurance for the head which was supposedly sunk. In the end, while the bad guys nearly capture them, the rival divers come to their rescue, having earlier revealed that they were searching for a U-boat sunk by Captain Early during World War II. As a result of an earlier rescue the boys performed, the divers were going to give them a share of the treasure and had come to do so when they found them in trouble. While the mystery is solved, the boys discover that the money the other divers were after is actually counterfeit. =Original edition= The Hardy Boys meet up with a professional diver by the name of Roland Perry, who is employed by the Crux Brothers diving company. After the boys rescue Perry from a mishap on the water, they lend him one of their father's suits, and Perry heads off to his next job at nearby Bailey's Landing. But the suit happened to contain important notes for the case that the elder Hardy was working on, so he sends the boys to retrieve them. Along the way, they run afoul of two thugs, Bock and Simon. After retrieving the notes, the boys stick around to help Perry raise a yacht belonging to a wealthy businessman. In the process, they become entangled in Perry's bitter feud with another diver, Gus Kuntz, the unscrupulous owner of a rival diving company. Kuntz employs the thugs Bock and Simon, and repeatedly tries to sabotage Perry's diving operations, putting Perry's and the boys' lives at risk. Mysterious notes left at the Hardys' hotel serve as the eponymous secret warnings, foretelling misfortune, but the boys are undaunted. At length the yacht is raised, and Perry moves on to his next job: searching for treasure in the sunken ocean liner Katawa off of Reed's Point. They enlist the aid of eager photographer and inventor Earl Chipsley and his remarkable underwater X-ray motion picture camera. But the second mate of the Katawa, Clark Hornblow, institutionalized after having gone mad at the time of the wreck, insists the riches are elsewhere, having been stolen by other officers using a lifeboat. What's more, Kuntz and his henchmen will stop at nothing to claim the gold and diamonds for themselves. The Hardys are beset by dangers above and below the surface of the sea as they attempt to secure the Katawa's fantastic treasure.

Plot summary (revised edition) While their father Fenton Hardy is working on cases of museum robberies, he asks Frank and Joe to stake out the Black Parrot, a shipping boat docked in Bayport. The Hardy boys get a job loading crates aboard the ship but because the crew is so unfriendly and are kept very busy, they don't have a chance to investigate. They instead decide to follow another lead and travel to New York to search for a rare old book. While scouring a used book store, they locate a book titled Empire of the Twisted Claw which bears a symbol on the cover which matches a ring the first mate of the Black Parrot was wearing. While they cannot afford to purchase the book, the store keeper allows them to read it, whereby they learn about the Empire of the Twisted Claw and the pirate ships named Black Parrot and Yellow Parrot and the King who controlled the empire. As the investigation continues, the Boys and their father learn that the thieves are targeting the DeGraw collection and will likely rob six more museums. They stand guard at one of the museums but when the thieves strike, they use a sleeping gas knocking the boys out. Following up on a lead, they find where the Black Parrot has docked again and watch while the crew loads about a dozen logs on board and the ship immediately leaves port. The Hardy boys then track down the Yellow Parrot where they take jobs to get aboard and look around. While investigating more of these strange logs in the storeroom, the logs break free and Frank must hang from the roof to avoid being crushed. When they learn that the Yellow Parrot is going to meet up with the Black Parrot, the boys realize that they must escape. They jump ship and swim to a strange island where they meet an odd man who lives on that island. They escape the island by hitching a ride with a pilot who is a friend of the island man, and then they can return home. Later, they receive a radio call from someone on the Yellow Parrot who is trying to help them. The boys fly to the source of the signal and find the ship hidden near the strange island. At first, they are captured but managed to escape while learning why the crooks desire the DeGraw collection and capture the masterminds behind the robberies. Plot summary (original edition) Famous detective Fenton Hardy informs his sons, Frank and Joe, that a clever, dangerous gang of smugglers is operating in their part of the country and the government must defeat it. He may need their help, in a hurry, and reminds them of the secret code he has given them which he will use to summon them quickly if need be. Frank and Joe do not tell him that Frank's wallet, containing the code, has been lost. In the meantime he asks the boys to search for an out of print book on criminology. As Fenton packs to depart on his mission, Frank notices that the house is under surveillance. Fenton takes his departure in disguise so that he won't be followed. Soon after he leaves, an attempt is made to break into the house, but Frank and Joe scare off the intruder. The next day they go out in search of the criminology book their father asked them to find. They find it in a used book store and also run across a curious volume called Fifty Thousand Dead Men, by a pirate captain. They head home with both books. At home they receive a call from a stranger, one Pierre, who has an exaggerated French Canadian accent, claiming to represent their father and demanding the delivery of his papers to a seedy bar in the water front district. There follows several attempts by Pierre to trick the boys into turning over their father's papers, including the use of the secret code after Frank's wallet is mysteriously returned. As each attempt is countered, the boys follow Pierre back to a tramp schooner, the Black Parrot, being loaded for departure. After surveying the ship and overhearing a sailor report that he had gotten the papers, they head back home. At home, they find their Aunt and the housekeeper tied up and their father's papers stolen. Remembering the comments they overheard on the Black Parrot regarding ‚Äúthe papers‚Äù, they hurry to the ship, only to find it has departed. They give chase in their speedboat, but run out of gas and the schooner gets away. Interrogating the clerk at the shipping office gives them little to go on except the vague information that the Black Parrot often plies the logging camps along the Canadian coast. Back home again, the boys‚Äô mother returns from a trip and relates to them a strange message from their father that was received by the hotel clerk. Using the code sheet, Frank a Joe determine that the message mentions ‚Äúfishing boat‚Äù and instructs them to go to the Canadian woods. They conclude that their father has been kidnapped and was only able to leave an incomplete message. They resolve to travel to the Canadian woods, explore around the lumbering camps to find their father and maybe the Black Parrot. They leave their friend, Chet, to watch over and protect the household. On the train Frank reads the pirate book and discovers that the pirate, one Captain Gronger, has a pet parrot that broke his leg and ended up with a twisted claw. The pirate captain adopts a twisted claw as his insignia. Once in Canada they travel into the woods to a lumber town, Woodsville, on the outskirts of the lumber country. Arriving at night, they check into a rustic boarding house / hotel and are assigned a room to be shared with two other boarders. Upon encountering the Hardys, the two boarders are immediately startled and they bolt and run. The Hardys give chase but the two get away. One of them resembles the intruder they confronted back home. Subsequent inquires reveal that the larger of the two is young Jim Hoskin, the arrogant, boastful, ne‚Äôer-do-well son of old Jim Hoskin. Setting out for old Jim Hoskin's cabin, they encounter and confront young Jim and his shorter companion, a sailor. After a brief fight, the two get away again. Waiting until dark to reconnoiter, Joe heads out alone, while Frank gets some more sleep. In the dark a car silently coasts through the village, its engine cut. Joe jumps onto the back and hangs on in order to follow the suspects. While hanging on, he hears Jim and the sailor gripe about Pierre, who acts as if he were the Claw King himself. When the car hits a bump, Joe is injured and is discovered. The two tie him to a log at the top of a log jam in a river, so when the jam is cleared he will be swept away and crushed to death. Awaking, and realizing that Joe has been gone far too long, Frank sets out to find him. Following his foot prints and then the car's tire tracks, he comes to where Joe was captured. He hears Joe crying for help, and rescues him from the log jam in the nick of time. Stumbling across a nearby lumber camp, they receive food and medical attention. One of the men identifies Jim Hoskin's companion as Slim Wetzel. Back at the hotel, they call home to their friend Chet, who has been watching over the house in their absence. He tells them another attempt was made to break in, and when he dusted for fingerprints, one of them looked like a claw. They decide to press deeper into the lumber country and make the rounds of all the lumber camps in order to find their father. On horseback, they head to a neighboring village. From a couple of locals they learn that Young Jim and Slim Wetzel had been in the area trying to obtain sleeping powder to take care of a ‚Äúmaniac‚Äù in their company. The ‚Äúmaniac‚Äù, lying in the back seat of the car, was moaning and raving something about ‚Äúfrogs climb double trees‚Äù. The Hardy's suspect the ‚Äúmaniac‚Äù is their father, feigning craziness and trying to convey a message through the code. Consulting the code, they determine that the police should raid some place in the woods, but the code does not provide a translation for ‚Äúdouble trees‚Äù. They surmise it to be a reference to a lumber camp name and find a ‚ÄúTwin Spruce Camp‚Äù nearby on their map. They head for the camp. Near the camp they are attacked by a large wolf-dog. After fending off the attack, they observe a man dragging the wolf-dog into a cabin. They suspect that their father is being held prisoner there. They decide to call on the Canadian Mounted Police for assistance and ride to the nearby headquarters. Sergeant Johnson tells them that the camp has been closed for four years and no-one should be there. At a gallop, all three ride back to the camp. As they sneak up on the cabin, they are again attacked by the wolf-dog, but Sergeant Johnson uses a weighted net to trap and dispatch it. Breaking into the cabin they discover and confront Young Jim and Slim Wetzel. Overcoming them, they tie them up, and the Sergeant leaves with the men, leaving Frank and Joe to guard the cabin until he returns. Exploring, Joe discovers a hidden room upstairs, and breaking into it, discovers his father in very poor condition, too weak even to talk. They provide their father a stimulant, and Frank relates that while Sergeant Johnson was tying up the prisoners, he noticed that they both had twisted claws branded on the tips of their index fingers. Fenton relates the story of his capture just after leaving the message the boys received from their mother and how he feigned being delirious and used his ranting to try to convey a message to them. As they talk, they notice that the forest around them is on fire, and that they are trapped. As the fire closes in on the cabin, all hope of escape seems cut off. Suddenly, a charging horse and rider burst through the wall of flames, and Sergeant Johnson dismounts. He quickly gives them direction on how to direct their horses through the fire and straps Fenton to his mount. After penetrating the firestorm safely, they head back to the village. At the village, Fenton receives medical attention. They decide to give Chet another call for an update. Chet tells them that while investigating the Black Parrot, he has found out that there are a number of Parrot boats, each named with a different color. Frank concludes that the smuggling gang has read the pirate book they picked up, and have been using it as a guide. Fenton summons the boys and tells them that Sergeant Johnson overheard the prisoners discussing a boat named the Black Parrot due to dock at a small port town, Little Cove. Fenton directs them ship out on the boat in order to solve the case. They travel to Little Cove. In Little Cove they find that the Black Parrot has not yet arrived. They then spy Pierre, and follow him back to a large house. In the morning they procure seaman's clothing as a disguise, and binoculars. They stake out Pierre's house and, using the binoculars, are able to distinguish a claw mark on his index finger. The next morning, the Black Parrot arrives and Frank and Joe head to the water front in their disguises to sign up for the crew. As luck would have it, when the boys approach the first mate he has just fired two rowdy crew members and hires them on the spot. They report to the ship the next morning and are put to work right away. In the course of their labor, Frank observes the twisted claw print on the Captain's finger and Joe overhears the Captain and Pierre say that they are sailing to King Barracuda's Island for a meeting of all the King's subjects from the world over. Joe notices that the Captain is an enthusiast for solitaire card games and manages to engage him with new games and strategies. Frank cozies up to ‚ÄúSparks‚Äù the radio operator. Joe gets the opportunity to covertly search the Captain's cabin and finds one of his father's missing papers. A note scribbled on it reports that Jim Hoskin had put Fenton out of the way, and was signed by Pierre. The crew notice that the Hardys have been trying to get friendly with the officers and confront them. One of them sarcastically mentions that Joe has been doing card tricks for the Captain. Impulsively, Joe demands a card deck and starts performing impromptu magic tricks. The crew is astonished and entertained by Joe's feats of prestidigitation and they win the crew over. The crew asks the boys to do them a favor and to try to find out from the Captain where the ship is headed. They have observed signs of bad luck and doom, and believe that only by getting to land soon will they break the spell. Frank promises to ask the Captain and let them know. When they observe Pierre going to the Captain's cabin, they eavesdrop and hear the Captain tell him they will make Barracuda Island six days off. But before they can report back, the crew mutinies and locks the Captain and other officers in the brig. Frank and Joe take the opportunity to search Pierre's cabin and find a report that details an amazing record of world-wide smuggling activities. The boys realize that if the mutiny is successful they will not be able to get to Barracuda Island and break the smuggling ring. They resolve to stop the mutiny. A ferocious storm arises; the mutineers squabble amongst themselves and prove incapable of handling the situation. The ship is near sinking and chaos reins. In the confusion, Frank get the key to the brig and frees the officers. They quickly take charge and the crew, fearing death, follows orders and fights to save the ship. In the end, the ship suffers heavy damage but survives, and the Captain is again in full control. The leaders of the mutiny are rounded up and locked in the brig. A few days later, the ship makes landfall at Barracuda Island, but the crew are disappointed to learn that they are strictly forbidden from going ashore. After the Captain, Pierre, and a few officers depart, the Hardys slip overboard and swim ashore. On the island they encounter a resident and are nearly exposed, but they convince him to keep their presence a secret. From him we learn that the island consists of three classes: an indigenous population of brown-skinned, loincloth-clad ‚Äúnatives‚Äù; a European population that are descendants of shipwreck survivors who are largely ignorant of the ‚Äúoutside world‚Äù and of the smuggling activities; and a ruling class led by the Barracuda King, which conducts various illegal enterprises around the world. The boys blend into the population and observe various festivities associated with arrival of the fleet for the yearly meeting with the King. They learn that there will be a parade that will welcome and escort the Captains and officers of each ship to the King's castle where they will report on their activities and receive recognition for their successes. The Hardys use the general commotion as the parade advances towards the castle to slip past the gate and gain entrance to the castle. Cautiously exploring, the secrete themselves in an empty chamber with a balcony overlooking the audience hall and the King's throne. From their hiding place, they witness the induction of the new recruits into the ‚ÄúOrder of the Twisted Claw‚Äù. Each initiate has the twisted claw insignia ceremonially branded on his forefinger with a poker heated in a cauldron of boiling oil. The King is then ready to accept the reports from each of the ships crews but first severely questions Pierre and the Captain concerning the absence of Young Jim and Slim, and are even threatened with death for having allowed them to disappear and thus endanger the Order. Pierre lies and tells the King they perished in the forest fire. The King reserves judgment until he hears their report. When it is their turn, Pierre and the Captain astound the gathering with the scope of their smuggling activities and their profitability. They provide details of how they use hollow logs and false papers to smuggle luxury goods into the United States and turn a profit on them. The King forgives the disappearance of Young Jim and Slim, and awards them the grand prize, a large chest of gold coins. The Hardys have seen enough and sneak out of the castle and swim back to the ship. Their absence had been noted by the officer in charge, but they make up a tall tale about taking a swim and being attacked by barracudas. The credulous crew backs them up in their story and is entertained by the boys as they elaborate on their adventure. ‚ÄúSparks‚Äù, the radio operator, prevails upon Frank to help him fix the wireless outfit; Frank winds a new coil and gets it working. The Captain and Pierre return to the ship, and in a chance encounter with him, Pierre eyes them suspiciously. The boys suspect they have been recognized, and as precaution, Frank tells Sparks that the coil needs more work and disconnects it. Shortly after, Pierre confronts them and has them tossed into the brig. The brothers decide that their only hope is to play on the crew's resentment towards the Captain and incite another mutiny. They find out that the Captain has rationed some of the gold coins to the men and so they are not going to turn against him. Changing tactics, Joe plays on their superstitious nature and tells one of the crew that the Captain is going to kill them, which will curse the ship and it will sink, drowning all aboard. The terrified seaman rushes to tell the rest of the crew. He returns and informs them that the crew is afraid of being punished and won't engage in a second uprising. Just then, one of the officers appears and herds them to the Captain's cabin. As a last desperate chance, the boys raise a commotion yelling out ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt kill us!‚Äù. The crew, eavesdropping outside, becomes fearful, breaks down the cabin door, and removes the Captain, Pierre and the officers to the brig. Now free, the brothers see their chance to use the wireless to summon help. Sparks feigns ignorance of the situation and requests that the coil be restored. Frank seems to oblige, and as soon as Sparks thinks the radio is fixed, turns on them and attempts to summon the other Parrot ships to put down the mutiny. But Frank only pretended to comply and the radio does not function. The crew imprison Sparks in the brig. With the radio fixed, the Hardys attempt to summon help, but a storm arises and the static makes it impossible to know if their messages are getting through. After repeated attempts to relay a message, the radio gives out without receiving any reply. One of the crew informs them that they have decided to change course and head for the Mediterranean in order to avoid prosecution for mutiny, and are even considering freeing the Captain, who has promised to double their money and make sure they are not punished. Just then, the lookout on the mast spots a ship steaming towards them. The radio messages got through and it is a U.S. revenue cutter. A shot is fired across the bow and a boarding crew takes over the ship. Fenton Hardy is aboard the cutter and congratulates his sons on a job well done. A worldwide alert is given, and any officers of the Parrot vessels with the claw insignia are being arrested. A contingent of American warships seize the island and capture the King of Barracuda. Back home, the Hardys travel to Washington for the official investigation, and confront the deposed king. They show him the pirate book and he confesses that the author was his grandfather, and that he always regretted losing it and feared that it would be his undoing.

Being a laboratory school, it also serves as a training ground for future teachers graduating on UFRJ.  History  Founded on May 20, 1948, the school was located in a building by the beach of Botafogo, yielded by Funda√ß√£o Getulio Vargas. From 1952 to 1962 the school remained in another building in S√£o Salvador square granted by the state government, and in 1962 it was transferred to its current location. Despite being a small school, CAp was, in the mid-1960s, one of the strongest references on student activism, the main force of resistance against the Brazilian military dictatorship.Mafra, P. Uma ruptura com a l√≥gica reprodutivista: o caso do Col√©gio de Aplica√ß√£o da UFRJ √† luz das contribui√ß√µes de Gramsci e Althusser http://www.unicamp.br/cemarx/anais_v_coloquio_arquivos/arquivos/comunicacoes/gt5/sessao1/Patricia_Mafra.pdf CAp is located on J.J. Seabra street, in the neighbourhood of Lagoa, South Zone of Rio de Janeiro. The building it occupies today is not federal - it belongs to the state government, and was landmarked by the city mayor for being one of the few horizontal constructions on Lagoa. It is in a rather bad condition, but the lack of government funding and these special conditions have contributed to making it quite difficult to have any effective restorations. In May 2005, a wall collapsed on one of the classrooms. It was a holiday, so the school was empty and no one was hurt. This triggered a rise on funds available for restorations on 2006, but some projects had to be delayed because of problems on the structure of the building. There is a request from the student body regarding giving CAp a building of its own. Most people suggest it could be located inside the UFRJ campus at Urca, but unfortunately this is not a priority for the federal government as it would demand too many resources.  Relations with university  \\"Col√©gio de Aplica√ß√£o\\", literally \\"Application School\\", means that the school is used as a training or research ground for UFRJ student-teachers. Students of CAp UFRJ may engage in research projects at UFRJ through NICJr. (\\"N√∫cleo de Inicia√ß√£o Cient√≠fica Jr.\\", English: \\"Junior Scientific Initiation Nucleus\\").  Students  As of 2008, classes on CAp are available from 1st grade of Ensino Fundamental (roughly equivalent to Elementary and Middle School) to the 3rd grade of \\"Ensino M√©dio\\" (roughly equivalent to High School). Students from the first five years have classes in the afternoon, and the rest in the morning, the only exception being the final year, in which there are classes in the afternoon in addition to the morning ones. There are admission draws for the 1st grade, in which 50 students enter the school, being divided in 2 classes of 25, on the 6th grade of \\"Ensino Fundamental\\", with 10 vacancies, dividing students in two classes of 30 each. On the 1st grade of \\"Ensino M√©dio\\" (9th grade), when 30 more students join the school, making it three classes of 30 students. And on the 2nd grade of \\"Ensino M√©dio\\" when they fill out the empty vacancies left by students who may have left the school or the ones who did not pass to the 2nd grade. This makes for a total of 760 students - 510 on the morning shift and 250 on the afternoon shift - not counting those who fail or who join the school in special conditions, such as being transferred from another laboratory school. Students are allowed one failure in the first nine years and one more in the last three. Any additional failures immediately expels the student from the school.

This book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by John Button in 1940. Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter.http://www.hardyboysonline.net/content.php?page=series-canon- revisions The original version of this book was rewritten in 1964 by James D. Lawrence resulting in two different stories with the same title. UK version published by William Collins Sons & Co. Ltd. as The Mystery of the Disappearing Floor, Volume 5, in 1971. Plot =Revised edition= The Hardy boys are asked by their father, Fenton Hardy, to assist him in solving a case involving a notorious jewel thief, Noel Strang, and his accomplices. Initially, they spot Strang's car and attempt to follow it until the car drops a purple smoke bomb and the Hardys are forced to pull over. While returning home from the car chase, they run into their friend Chet Morton who was in the woods rock collecting when he heard weird screams. When they go to investigate, they find a strangely tiled floor in the woods and nearby an injured man suddenly revives and runs off. Their adventure continues with a stolen amethyst, a bomb damaging their boat the Sleuth, and a savage looking hound which turns out to be an electrified scare device. When Aunt Gertrude hears where the boys found Chet, she tells them that they were close to Old Man Perth‚Äôs house where strange deaths have happened. The owner of the Perth Mansion, Jerome Perth, was a business tycoon who made many enemies due to his swindles. When he died his nephew, Clarence Perth, inherited the house. Shortly after moving in, the servants awoke during a night to him screaming and he was found on the floor of his bedroom with a fractured skull, saying \\"Th..the Floor!\\", before dying. The door and the windows of the room were all locked from the inside, so the mystery of how he died was never solved. The Hardy boys identify a pilot who may be helping the thieves, so they walk into his hangar to examine his plane. Armed with a miniature camera, Joe snaps a picture of a map found in the plane. This leads them to a cabin hidden in the woods in a small bight named Tigers Bight. Unfortunately, the boys don‚Äôt have a chance to investigate the cabin as their family friend Jack Wayne crashes his plane Skyhappy Sal nearby and is injured. After rescuing Jack, the boys return to the Perth mansion where they find the jewel thieves hiding out and tricking a professor, Aden Darrow, into making a ‚Äòfreeze ray gun‚Äô for them. After more investigation, the Hardy boys manage to figure out that Clarence died by accident due to the 'disappearing floor' in his bedroom. Unfortunately, the boys are captured before they can tell anyone, but luckily due to Strang's bragging, they are informed about how the gang has been using the freeze ray guns to stun security guards and steal the jewels. Strang explains how they rigged an elevator to go to the wrong floor where they had set up a fake office in order to receive a special shipment of diamonds without arousing any suspicion until they were safely away in the Haley Heist. Eventually Fenton Hardy reaches the Perth Mansion with the police and rescues his sons, arresting the thieves. =Original edition= The boys help bring a gang of bank robbers to justice. Adaptations In the television series, The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, the story is completely rewritten. In it, the boys are asked by their father to help him keep surveillance on an employee of a technology firm who have hired for a case. However, their participation is complicated when they follow him to an isolated property and are beset with a number of strange experiences, beginning with a UFO sighting, that make them doubt their senses.

Fut≈´·∏• (Arabic script ŸÅÿ™Ÿàÿ≠, singular fat·∏• ŸÅÿ™ÿ≠) is an Arabic word with the literal meaning of \\"openings\\", as in \\"liberation\\".  Ideology/etymology  As is clear from the literal meaning of the word, fut≈´·∏• is a term with a strong bias in favor of the conquests it signifies, implying their general beneficence and legitimacy. Historian Bernard Lewis describes the meaning of fut≈´·∏• within classic Islamic thought: > These were not seen as conquests in the vulgar sense of territorial > acquisitions, but as the overthrow of impious regimes and illegitimate > hierarchies, and the \\"opening\\" of their peoples to the new revelation and > dispensation... The use of the root ft·∏• is thus not unlike the 20th century > use of the verb \\"liberate\\", and is indeed sometimes replaced by the latter > verb (·∏•arrara) in modern Arabic writing on early Islamic history. The Arabic > verb ghalaba, \\"conquer\\", with its connotation of overwhelming by means of > superior force, is sometimes used in early accounts of the Muslim conquests, > but only in the context of actual military operations... > Underlying this usage, clearly, is a concept of the essential rightfulness > or legitimacy of the Muslim advance and the subsequent illegitimacy of > Muslim retreat before infidel conquest... The advance of Muslim power is > thus an opening or a liberation, to give free scope to this divinely > implanted propensity.The Political Language of Islam, pp. 93‚Äì94  Fut≈´·∏• literature  Many histories from the classical period of Islamic civilization dealing with the early conquests have fut≈´·∏• in their title and are considered to form their own genre of literature, called fut≈´·∏• reports. Like many other histories from the early period, the fut≈´·∏• reports contain a mixture of genres and material, with some clearly of an administrative, religio-legal, philosophical, or edificatory nature. For example, a common feature of the genre is an account of the opposing ambassador's first impression of the Arab army in which he remarks favorably upon the primitive virtues of these early Muslim warriors, thus implicitly criticizing the luxury and over-refinement of the author's own time. The following is a partial list of these histories: * Fut≈´h Misr (Conquests of Egypt) by Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam * Fut≈´h al-Sham (Conquests of Syria) by al-Azdi * Fut≈´h al-Iraq (Conquests of Iraq) by al-Waqidi * Fut≈´h al-Habasa (Conquests of Abyssinia) by Sihab ad-Din Admad ibn Abd-al-Qadir * Fut≈´h al-Buldan (Conquests of the Lands) by Abu Al- Abbas Ahmad Bin Jab Al-Baladhuri  Impact  The impact of the fut≈´·∏• conquests was immense, not least of all on the conquerors themselves, who incorporated many features of the advanced cultures they absorbed into what eventually became classic Islamic civilization. Among the conquered peoples, the upheavals: Islamization and Arabization. The former occurred as Islam became a society's regnant religio-political framework. The latter occurred as Arab customs and the Arab language became widely adopted by a population. Though the two developments often occurred in tandem, the expression of one did not necessarily mean the expression of the other. Many Middle Eastern Christians, for example were Arabized but never Islamicized, while the Persians were Islamicized but did not Arabize. Of the two upheavals, Islamization had the greater impact on social and cultural identity. In all cases Islamization led to a people's near total rejection of their pagan, pre- Islamic past, such that their ancestral achievements and heritage were either forgotten or actively denigrated. When in the 19th Century European Orientalists began recovering this past, their findings were at first ignored by the Muslim residents of the Near East: :The discovery... of the ancient past was a non-Middle Eastern enterprise and achievement, and for a long time it had no impact on the peoples of the Islamic Middle East, who remained uninterested in their own pagan past. For them, significant history began with the advent of Islam. That was their own, their true history, the history that mattered. What came before was an age of ignorance, of no value with no lesson to teach. :The Multiple Identities of the Middle East, p. 68 Though this alienation may be partially explained by the Arab cultural imperialism implicit in Islamization (as exemplified in the adoption of the Arabic script, for example), there is a more direct theological rationale for this, which is the Islamic concept of jahiliyyah, or state of ignorance and barbarity which supposedly prevailed in pre-Islamic Arabia. Readily applied by the first Islamicized peoples to their own pagan pasts, it led them to view these epochs as times of rampant impiety, ignorance, and injustice from which little of value could be gleaned. Thus one trope of converted Muslims' perception of their own history is the depiction of the pre-Islamic political order as one of rampant exploitation and tyranny, with rulers ordering society according to malign whim rather than in humble subordinance to God's beneficent law for mankind: :Until the findings of Egyptology became known to them, all that most Egyptians knew about Pharaoh was what they learned from the Qur'an, and the image of Pharaoh in the Qur'an is much the same as in the Old Testament. For Muslims as for Christians and Jews, Pharaoh was the archetypal pagan tyrant and oppressor in which the heroes are the Ban≈´h IsrƒÅ'ƒ´l, the children of Israel. :The Multiple Identities of the Middle East, p. 77 And in Islamic Persia, \\"Chosroes\\", from the great Persian king Khosrau II, became as strong a by-word for tyrannical pagan kingship as \\"Pharaoh\\" (though ironically the pagan destroyer of the Achaemenid Empire, Alexander the Great, was lionized thanks to an accident of Qur'anic textual sources). Such hostile depictions of the pre-Islamic political order are a necessary complement to the ideology of fut≈´·∏•: in order for the Muslim conquests to be seen as liberatory, the social orders which they replaced had to be depicted as negatively as possible. With the rejection of the pre-Islamic political order came the rejection of its cultural legacy as well, often expressed by the iconoclastic destruction of its monumental remains as in the recent demolition of the Buddhas of Bamyan. In Egypt, for example, the missing nose of the Great Sphinx of Giza was broken off by a fanatic Sufi when he saw the local farmers making offerings to the Sphinx. And in Iran: : ...the ancient past had been forgotten and to a greater extent obliterated. In Persepolis, the ancient Persian capital, the Muslim conquerors had hacked away the faces of the Medes and Persians depicted in the friezes, seeing in them an expression of pagan idolatry. Only the most recent pre-Islamic history... was known at all, and that in a sketchy form, and from Arabic sources. The more ancient history of Iran was forgotten, and even the name of Cyrus, the founder of the Persian state, was unknown. :The Multiple Identities of the Middle East, p. 71 The popular dissemination of Orientalist discoveries led to a revision of these attitudes, however, and at least a partial reassertion of pre-Islamic identities. In Egypt, the works of native scholars such as RifƒÅ'a Rafi' al-TƒÅhtawƒ´ led to renewed interest in the Pharaonic past and helped give rise to Egyptian national identity movements such as Pharaonism. Though initially derided by other Arabs as tafar'un (meaning lapsing into pharaonism), the Egyptian movements were in time emulated elsewhere: :This movement in Egypt was first opposed, condemned, even derided in other Arabic speaking countries. It was seen as something artificial, as a parochial attempt to create a little Egypt within the greater Arab or Islamic brotherhood. It was denounced by pan-Arabists as separatist, by religious people as neo-pagan, and by both as divisive. Nevertheless, the example of Egypt had an impact in other Middle Eastern lands. :The Multiple Identities of the Middle East, pp. 69‚Äì70  Contemporary Attitudes  The acceptance of classical Islam's interpretation of the fut≈´·∏• conquests by the Islamicized/Arabized peoples of the Near East and beyond varies. It has been least contentious among the Arab countries of Asia, where identity with the original Arab conquerors is strongest. In modern Arab historiography there has been a trend (in part due to the influence of Western-style nationalism), to portray the earliest conquests as liberations of Arabs (or proto-Arabs) from Sassanid/Byzantine imperial domination: :Most Arabs today are Arabized descendants of the inhabitants of pre-conquest Syria, Iraq, and Egypt, but any suggestion that Islamic culture is an Arabized development of what prevailed in those pre-conquest lands deeply offends them. :Lapidus, The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World (), p. 24 = North Africa = In North Africa, a reassertion of ethnic and linguistic identity among Berbers called Berberism has recently developed. = Iran = Despite a rich pre- Islamic political and cultural heritage, attempts at a reassertion of national identity in Iran have often met with strong resistance: :In 1971, when the Shah of Iran held a great celebration in Persepolis to commemorate the 2,500th anniversary of the foundation of the Persian monarchy by Cyrus the Great, he was vehemently attacked on Islamic religious grounds. Exalting the monarchy was bad enough, but far worse was the proclamation of a common identity with the Zoroastrian past, and a consequent redefinition of the basis of allegiance. For the shah's religious critics, the identity of the Iranians was defined by Islam, and their brothers were Muslims in other countries, not their own unbelieving and misguided ancestors. :The Multiple Identities of the Middle East, p. 75 With the overthrow of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979, traditional notions of identity returned to Iran, as can be seen by the unabashed embrace of the classic fut≈´·∏• interpretation of Persian history in the propaganda of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War: :The Iraqis, on their side, call the Iranians Furs, a somewhat derogatory term in medieval times, with a suggestion that the Persians were the heirs of the Zoroastrians defeated at the battle of Qadisiyya in AD 637. This battle, which shattered the military power of the Iranian emperors and led to the incorporation of all their lands and peoples in the Muslim Arab Empire, is claimed with pride by both sides. For the Iraqis, it was a victory of Arabs over Persians... For the soldiers of the Islamic Republic, it was victory of Muslims over heathens, and a blessed beginning of the Islamization of the peoples of Iran. :The Political Language of Islam, p. 121 = Indian subcontinent = Acceptance in Pakistan of fut≈´·∏• \\"salvation history\\" can be seen in current expressions of alienation from both the political as well as cultural legacies of its pre-Islamic past: :In September 1979, on Defense of Pakistan Day, there was a long article in the Pakistan Times on Bin Qasim as a strategist. The assessment was military, neutral, fair to the soldiers of both sides. It drew a rebuke from the chairman of the National Commission on Historical and Cultural Research. :\\"Employment of appropriate phraseology is necessary when one is projecting the image of a hero. Expressions such as 'invader' and 'defenders' and 'the Indian Army' fighting bravely but not being quick enough to 'fall upon the withdrawing enemy' loom large in the article. 'Had Raja Dahir defended the Indus heroically and stopped Qasim from crossing it, the history of the subcontinent might have been quite different.' One fails to understand whether the writer is applauding the victory of the hero or lamenting the defeat of his rival?\\" :Among the Believers, p. 141 :The excavated city of Mohenjo- Daro... is one of the archaeological glories of Pakistan and the world. The excavations are now being damaged by waterlogging and salinity, and appeals for money have been made to world organizations. A feature letter in the Dawn offered its own ideas for the site.

Say (O Mohammed, to the disbelievers): Travel in the land and see the nature of the consequence for those who were before you. Most of them were idolators.\\" :Among the Believers, pp. 141‚Äì142 An interesting cultural adaptation found mainly here, though, is the widespread claim of descent from the Arab (or Moghul) conquerors: :\\"Islam doesn't show on my face. We have nearly all, subcontinental Muslims, invented Arab ancestors for ourselves. Most of us are sayeds, descendants of Mohammed through his daughter Fatima and cousin and son-in-law Ali...

He is best remembered for his screenplay for In the Heat of the Night, for which he won an Academy Award in 1967, and for creating the television series Naked City and Route 66. Other features as screenwriter include the Irwin Allen productions The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure. Early life, family and education Born in Detroit, Michigan, Sterling Silliphant was named for his father, Sterling Silliphant, a Canadian who immigrated to the United States in 1911, becoming a US citizen in 1916. His mother was Ethel M. Silliphant. He had one brother, Leigh, who was three years younger. The family moved to Glendale, California when the brothers were young. He graduated from Hoover High School and subsequently, from the University of Southern California.\\"Biography: Stirling Silliphant\\", Turner Classic Movies\\"Profile: Stirling Silliphant\\", Museum of Broadcast Communications, Chicago. Career Silliphant was a film and television writer with more than 700 hours of prime-time television drama to his credit, many of which earned Emmys for their producers, directors, and cast members. However, he never received an Emmy personally as writer. Time in 1967 referred to him in a feature article with the statement: \\"The moving finger...having written, moved on!\\" Production manager Sam Manners called him from the road unit of Route 66 from El Paso, Texas. He told Stirling they could save perhaps $100,000 if Stirling could write an extra story for the show that could be shot in El Paso while the production trucks and crew were there. Silliphant obliged, and had the script ready in a couple of days. The guest star was Albert Dekker, who was flown in to portray his part over the weekend. Although he worked constantly in Hollywood, he had a well-known aversion against living in Southern California, where he had grown up. After he became successful, he built a house in Tiburon, California and commuted regularly by air to Los Angeles. =Television= During World War II, Silliphant served as a lieutenant in the United States Army. Upon his discharge in 1946 in the earlier part of his career, he was publicity director for Walt Disney, and was lead writer on the stories incorporated into The Mickey Mouse Club. He produced several independent films such as 5 Against the House with Kim Novak, Huk! and Maracaibo. Later he broke into television, writing for the live Playhouse 90. Perry Mason and Alfred Hitchcock Presents soon followed. Silliphant was known for his involvement in two TV series of the sixties, Route 66 and Naked City. Silliphant was quoted as saying that a number of his Naked City scripts were far superior to the script that won him the Oscar for In the Heat of the Night. He adapted eight half-hour episodes of Naked City into a tie-in paperback as well, which was published in 1959. One of his later series creations was Longstreet, which featured a blind detective played by James Franciscus, who had also starred in the first season of Naked City. He wrote three television miniseries: Pearl (about the attack on Pearl Harbor), Space (based on the James Michener novel about America's early space program), and Mussolini: The Untold Story. He wrote the script for a never-produced TV miniseries of Atlas Shrugged, the novel by Ayn Rand. =Film= Silliphant wrote or co-wrote 47 feature films, including Maracaibo (produced and directed by and starring Cornel Wilde); the Jacques Tourneur noir Nightfall; Village of the Damned; the Charles Bronson spy thriller Telefon, The Liberation of L.B. Jones (director William Wyler's final film); The Killer Elite (directed by Sam Peckinpah); the Dirty Harry crime drama The Enforcer and the arm wrestling story Over the Top (the latter with its star Sylvester Stallone). In addition to the Academy Award, In the Heat of the Night also earned Silliphant an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America, for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. He helped to pull film concepts together. He penned the screenplay for Shaft in Africa, the third film in the Shaft series. With Chatrichalerm Yukol, he co-wrote the screenplay to the 1994 Thai action film, Salween. He was a close friend of Bruce Lee, under whom he studied martial arts. Lee was featured in the Silliphant-penned detective movie Marlowe and four episodes of the series Longstreet. Silliphant reportedly recommended Lee for action choreography work. They had been working on a philosophical martial arts script, The Silent Flute (later known as Circle of Iron), which was to star Lee and James Coburn, and the pre-production even went to the extent of all three going to India on an unsuccessful location hunt. India was selected because Warner Brothers could not repatriate money their films generated in India due to foreign exchange regulations. The Siliphant, Coburn and Lee project was greenlit on the condition that the film would be shot in India to use the money unused in Warner's India accounts. Silliphant's last screenplay was for the 1995 film The Grass Harp. Personal life and later years Silliphant had a son, Loren (June 18, 1950 ‚Äì February 12, 1969), with actress Patricia Wymore. Loren was shot and killed at age 18 by Chester Allen Johnson, who was found guilty of first-degree murder. Loren Silliphant was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. In 1974, Silliphant married Tiana Alexandra Du Long, with whom he had two children, Stirling and Dayle. Actor and martial arts expert Bruce Lee was a martial arts student and a friend of Silliphant. Silliphant got interested in Lee's specialities and with other fellow actor James Coburn they worked on developing The Silent Flute. Silliphant later penned several projects that included Lee and his abilities, the first Marlowe (1969) where Lee plays Winslow Wong a hoodlum well versed in martial arts, Lee also did fight choreographies for the film A Walk in the Spring Rain (1970), and Lee played Li Tsung a Jeet Kune Do instructor who teaches it to the main character in the tv show Longstreet (1971), included in the script were elements of his martial arts philosophy. In 1988, Silliphant moved to Bangkok, and subsequently converted to Buddhism. He died from prostate cancer on April 26, 1996, at the age of 78. His work papers are archived at University of California, Los Angeles's Westwood campus.

It was first described in 1922 by Swedish astronomer Gunnar Malmquist (1893‚Äì1982), who then greatly elaborated upon this work in 1925. In statistics, this bias is referred to as a selection bias or data censoring. It affects the results in a brightness- limited survey, where stars below a certain apparent brightness cannot be included. Since observed stars and galaxies appear dimmer when farther away, the brightness that is measured will fall off with distance until their brightness falls below the observational threshold. Objects which are more luminous, or intrinsically brighter, can be observed at a greater distance, creating a false trend of increasing intrinsic brightness, and other related quantities, with distance. This effect has led to many spurious claims in the field of astronomy. Properly correcting for these effects has become an area of great focus. Understanding the bias As light rays leave the star homogeneously in every direction, they fill a sphere whose radius grows with time. As the sphere grows, the surface area increases, however the number of light rays stays the same. Following a patch on the surface of the sphere with area , fewer light rays pass through that patch as the light travels further from the star. =Magnitudes and brightness= In everyday life it is easy to see that light dims as it gets farther away. This can be seen with car headlights, candles, flashlights, and many other lit objects. This dimming follows the inverse square law, which states that the brightness of an object decreases as , where is the distance between the observer and the object. Starlight also follows the inverse square law. Light rays leave the star in equal amounts in all directions. The light rays create a sphere of light surrounding the star. As time progresses, the sphere grows as the light rays travel through space away from the star. While the sphere of light grows, the number of light rays stays the same. So, the amount of light per unit of surface area of the sphere (called flux in astronomy) decreases with distance and therefore time. When observing a star, only the light rays that are in the given area being viewed can be detected. This is why a star appears dimmer the farther away it is. If there are two stars with the same intrinsic brightness (called luminosity in astronomy), each at a different distance, the closer star will appear brighter while the further will appear dimmer. In astronomy, the apparent brightness of a star, or any other luminous object, is called the apparent magnitude. The apparent magnitude depends on the intrinsic brightness (also called absolute magnitude) of the object and its distance. If all stars had the same luminosity, the distance from Earth to a particular star could be easily determined. However, stars have a wide range in luminosities. Therefore, it can be difficult to distinguish a very luminous star that is very far away from a less luminous star that is closer. This is why it is so hard to calculate the distance to astronomical objects. =Source of the Malmquist bias= In a volume of space filled with stars, the stars have a range of luminosities and have some average luminosity shown by the dashed blue line. However, the more distant, less luminous stars will not be seen. This lowest luminosity that can be seen at a given distance is depicted by the red curve. Any star below that curve will not be seen. The average luminosity of only the stars that will be seen will be higher, as shown by the dashed red line. Typically, when looking at an area of sky filled with stars, only stars that are brighter than a limiting apparent magnitude can be seen. As discussed above, the very luminous stars that are farther away will be seen, as well as luminous and faint stars that are closer. There will appear to be more luminous objects within a certain distance from Earth than faint objects. However, there are many more faint stars: they simply cannot be seen because they are so dim. The bias towards luminous stars when observing a patch of sky affects calculations of the average absolute magnitude and average distance to a group of stars. Because of the luminous stars that are at a further distance, it will appear as if our sample of stars is farther away than it actually is, and that each star is intrinsically brighter than it actually is. This effect is known as the Malmquist bias. When studying a sample of luminous objects, whether they be stars or galaxies, it is important to correct for the bias towards the more luminous objects. There are many different methods that can be used to correct for the Malmquist bias as discussed below. The Malmquist bias is not limited to luminosities. It affects any observational quantity whose detectability diminishes with distance. Correction methods The ideal situation is to avoid this bias from entering a data survey. However, magnitude limited surveys are the simplest to perform, and other methods are difficult to put together, with their own uncertainties involved, and may be impossible for first observations of objects. As such, many different methods exist to attempt to correct the data, removing the bias and allowing the survey to be usable. The methods are presented in order of increasing difficulty, but also increasing accuracy and effectiveness. =Limiting the sample= The simplest method of correction is to only use the non-biased portions of the data set, if any, and throw away the rest of the data. Depending on the limiting magnitude selected, there may be a range of distances in the data set over which all objects of any possible absolute magnitude could be seen. As such, this small subset of data should be free of the Malmquist bias. This is easily accomplished by cutting off the data at the edge of where the lowest absolute magnitude objects would be hitting the limiting magnitude. Unfortunately, this method would waste a great deal of good data, and would limit the analysis to nearby objects only, making it less than desirable. (Looking at the figure to the right, only the first fifth of the data in distance could be kept before a data point is lost to the bias.) Of course, this method assumes that distances are known with relatively good accuracy, which as mentioned before, is a difficult process in astronomy. =Traditional correction= The first solution, proposed by Malmquist in his 1922 work, was to correct the calculated average absolute magnitude (\\\\overline{M}) of the sample back to the true average absolute magnitude (M0). The correction would be : \\\\overline{\\\\Delta M} = \\\\overline{M}- M_0 To calculate the bias correction, Malmquist and others following this method follow six main assumptions: #There exists no interstellar absorption, or that the stuff in space between stars (like gas and dust) is not affecting the light and absorbing parts of it. This assumes that the brightness is simply following the inverse square law, mentioned above. #The luminosity function (Œ¶) is independent of the distance (r). This basically just means that the universe is the same everywhere, and that stars will be similarly distributed somewhere else as they are here. #For a given area on the sky, or more specifically the celestial sphere, the spatial density of stars (œÅ) depends only on distance. This assumes that there are the same number of stars in each direction, on average. #There is completeness, meaning the sample is complete and nothing is missed, to an apparent magnitude limit (mlim). #The luminosity function can be approximated as a Gaussian function, centered on an intrinsic mean absolute magnitude M0. #Stars are of the same spectral type, with intrinsic mean absolute magnitude M0 and dispersion œÉ. Obviously, this is a very ideal situation, with the final assumption being particularly troubling, but allows for an approximate correction of simple form. By integrating the luminosity function over all distances and all magnitudes brighter than mlim, : \\\\overline{\\\\Delta M} = - \\\\sigma^2 \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{d} \\\\ln A(m_\\\\lim)}{\\\\operatorname{d} m_\\\\lim} where A(mlim) is the total number of stars brighter than mlim. If the spatial distribution of stars can be assumed to be homogeneous, this relation is simplified even further, to the generally accepted form of : \\\\overline{\\\\Delta M} = - 1.382\\\\sigma^2 Multiple-band observation corrections The traditional method assumes that the measurements of apparent magnitude and the measurements from which distance is determined are from the same band, or predefined range, of wavelengths (e.g. the H band, a range of infrared wavelengths from roughly about 1300‚Äì2000 nanometers), and this leads to the correction form of cœÉ2, where c is some constant. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case, as many samples of objects are selected from one wavelength band but the distance is calculated from another. For example, astronomers frequently select galaxies from B-band catalogs, which are the most complete, and use these B band magnitudes, but the distances for the galaxies are calculated using the Tully‚ÄìFisher relation and the H band. When this happens, the square of the variance is replaced by the covariance between the scatter in the distance measurements and in the galaxy selection property (e.g. magnitude). =Volume weighting= Another fairly straightforward correction method is to use a weighted mean to properly account for the relative contributions at each magnitude. Since the objects at different absolute magnitudes can be seen out to different distances, each point's contribution to the average absolute magnitude or to the luminosity function can be weighted by 1/Vmax, where Vmax is the maximum volume over which the objects could have been seen. Brighter objects (that is, objects with smaller absolute magnitudes) will have a larger volume over which they could have been detected, before falling under the threshold, and thus will be given less weight through this method since these bright objects will be more fully sampled. The maximum volume can be approximated as a sphere with radius found from the distance modulus, using the object's absolute magnitude and the limiting apparent magnitude. However, there are two major complications to calculating Vmax. First is the completeness of the area covered in the sky, which is the percentage of the sky that the objects were taken from. A full sky survey would collect objects from the entire sphere, 4œÄ steradians, of sky but this is usually impractical, both from time constraints and geographical limitations (ground-based telescopes can only see a limited amount of sky due to the Earth being in the way). Instead, astronomers will generally look at a small patch or area of sky and then infer universal distributions by assuming that space is either isotropic, that it is generally the same in every direction, or is following a known distribution, such as that one will see more stars by looking toward the center of a galaxy than by looking directly away. Generally, the volume can be simply scaled down by the percentage actually viewed, giving the correct number of objects to volume relation. This effect could potentially be ignored in a single sample, all from the same survey, as the objects will basically all be altered by the same numerical factor, but it is incredibly important to account for in order to be able to compare between different surveys with different sky coverage. The second complication is cosmological concerns of redshift and the expanding universe, which must be considered when looking at distant objects. In these cases, the quantity of interest is the comoving distance, which is a constant distance between two objects assuming that they are moving away from each other solely with the expansion of the universe, known as the Hubble flow. In effect, this comoving distance is the object's separation if the universe's expansion were neglected, and it can be easily related to the actual distance by accounting for how it would have expanded. The comoving distance can be used to calculate the respective comoving volume as usual, or a relation between the actual and comoving volumes can also be easily established. If z is the object's redshift, relating to how far emitted light is shifted toward longer wavelengths as a result of the object moving away from us with the universal expansion, DA and VA are the actual distance and volume (or what would be measured today) and DC and VC are the comoving distance and volumes of interest, then : D_C = D_A (1 + z) : V_C = V_A (1 + z)^3 A large downside of the volume weighting method is its sensitivity to large-scale structures, or parts of the universe with more or less objects than average, such as a star cluster or a void. Having very overdense or underdense regions of objects will cause an inferred change in our average absolute magnitude and luminosity function, according with the structure. This is a particular issue with the faint objects in calculating a luminosity function, as their smaller maximum volume means that a large-scale structure therein will have a large impact. Brighter objects with large maximum volumes will tend to average out and approach the correct value in spite of some large-scale structures. =Advanced methods= Many more methods exist which become increasingly complicated and powerful in application. A few of the most common are summarized here, with more specific information found in the references. Stepwise maximum likelihood method This method is based on the distribution functions of objects (such as stars or galaxies), which is a relation of how many objects are expected with certain intrinsic brightnesses, distances, or other fundamental values. Each of these values have their own distribution function which can be combined with a random number generator to create a theoretical sample of stars. This method takes the distribution function of distances as a known, definite quantity, and then allows the distribution function of absolute magnitudes to change. In this way, it can check different distribution functions of the absolute magnitudes against the actual distribution of detected objects, and find the relation that provides the maximum probability of recreating the same set of objects. By starting with the detected, biased distribution of objects and the appropriate limits to detection, this method recreates the true distribution function. However, this method requires heavy calculations and generally relies on computer programs. Schechter estimators Paul Schechter found a very interesting relation between the logarithm of a spectral line's line width and its apparent magnitude, when working with galaxies. In a perfect, stationary case, spectral lines should be incredibly narrow bumps, looking like lines, but motions of the object such as rotation or motion in our line of sight will cause shifts and broadening of these lines. The relation is found by starting with the Tully‚ÄìFisher relation, wherein the distance to a galaxy is related to its apparent magnitude and its velocity width, or the 'maximum' speed of its rotation curve. From macroscopic Doppler broadening, the logarithm of the line width of an observed spectral line can be related to the width of the velocity distribution. If the distances are assumed to be known very well, then the absolute magnitude and the line width are closely related. For example, working with the commonly used 21cm line, an important line relating to neutral hydrogen, the relation is generally calibrated with a linear regression and given the form : \\\\overline{M} = \\\\alpha P + \\\\beta where P is log(line width) and Œ± and Œ≤ are constants. The reason that this estimator is useful is that the inverse regression line is actually unaffected by the Malmquist bias, so long as the selection effects are only based on magnitude. As such, the expected value of P given M will be unbiased and will give an unbiased log distance estimator. This estimator has many properties and ramifications which can make it a very useful tool. Complex mathematical relations Advanced versions of the traditional correction mentioned above can be found in the literature, limiting or changing the initial assumptions to suit the appropriate author's needs. Often, these other methods will provide very complicated mathematical expressions with very powerful but specific applications. For example, work by Luri et al. found a relation for the bias for stars in a galaxy which relates the correction to the variance of the sample and the apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, and the height above the galactic disk. This gave a much more exact and accurate result, but also required an assumption about the spatial distribution of stars in the desired galaxy. While useful individually, and there are many examples published, these have very limited scope and are not generally as broadly applicable as the other methods mentioned above. Applications The dashed red line is an example luminosity function when the Malmquist bias is not corrected for. The more numerous low luminosity objects are underrepresented because of the apparent magnitude limit of the survey. The solid blue line is the properly corrected luminosity function using the volume-weighted correction method. Anytime a magnitude-limited sample is used, one of the methods described above should be used to correct for the Malmquist bias. For instance, when trying to obtain a luminosity function, calibrate the Tully‚ÄìFisher relation, or obtain the value of the Hubble constant, the Malmquist bias can strongly change the results. The luminosity function gives the number of stars or galaxies per luminosity or absolute magnitude bin. When using a magnitude-limited sample, the number of faint objects is underrepresented as discussed above. This shifts the peak of the luminosity function from the faint end to a brighter luminosity and changes the shape of the luminosity function. Typically, the volume weighting method is used to correct the Malmquist bias so that the survey is equivalent to a distance- limited survey rather than a magnitude-limited survey. The figure to the right shows two luminosity functions for an example population of stars that is magnitude-limited. The dashed luminosity function shows the effect of the Malmquist bias, while the solid line shows the corrected luminosity function. Malmquist bias drastically changes the shape of the luminosity function. Another application that is affected by the Malmquist bias is the Tully‚ÄìFisher relation, which relates the luminosity of spiral galaxies to their respective velocity width. If a nearby cluster of galaxies is used to calibrate the Tully‚ÄìFisher relation, and then that relation is applied to a distant cluster, the distance to the farther cluster will be systematically underestimated. By underestimating the distance to clusters, anything found using those clusters will be incorrect; for example, when finding the value of the Hubble constant. These are just a few examples where the Malmquist bias can strongly affect results. As mentioned above, anytime a magnitude-limited sample is used, the Malmquist bias needs to be corrected for. A correction is not limited to just the examples above. Alternatives Some alternatives do exist to attempt to avoid the Malmquist bias, or to approach it in a different way, with a few of the more common ones summarized below. =Distance-limited sampling= One ideal method to avoid the Malmquist bias is to only select objects within a set distance, and have no limiting magnitude but instead observe all objects within this volume. Clearly, in this case, the Malmquist bias is not an issue as the volume will be fully populated and any distribution or luminosity function will be appropriately sampled. Unfortunately, this method is not always practical. Finding distances to astronomical objects is very difficult, and even with the aid of objects with easily determined distances, called standard candles, and similar things, there are great uncertainties. Further, distances are not generally known for objects until after they have already been observed and analyzed, and so a distance limited survey is usually only an option for a second round of observations, and not initially available. Finally, distance limited surveys are generally only possible over small volumes where the distances are reliably known, and thus it is not practical for large surveys. =Homogeneous and inhomogeneous Malmquist correction= This method attempts to correct the bias again, but through very different means. Rather than trying to fix the absolute magnitudes, this method takes the distances to the objects as being the random variables and attempts to rescale those. In effect, rather than giving the stars in the sample the correct distribution of absolute magnitudes (and average absolute magnitude), it attempts to 'move' the stars such that they would have a correct distribution of distances. Ideally, this should have the same end result as the magnitude correction methods and should result in a correctly represented sample. In either the homogeneous or inhomogeneous case, the bias is defined in terms of a prior distribution of distances, the distance estimator, and the likelihood function of these two being the same distribution. The homogeneous case is much simpler and rescales the raw distance estimates by a constant factor. Unfortunately, this will be very insensitive to large scale structures such as clustering as well as observational selection effects, and will not give a very accurate result. The inhomogeneous case attempts to correct this by creating a more complicated prior distribution of objects by taking into account structures seen in the observed distribution. In both cases though, it is assumed that the probability density function is Gaussian with constant variance and a mean of the true average log distance, which is far from accurate. However, this method is debated and may not be accurate in any implementation due to uncertainties in calculating the raw, observed distance estimates causing the assumptions to use this method to be invalid. = Historical alternatives = The term 'Malmquist bias' has not always been definitively used to refer to the bias outlined above. As recently as the year 2000, the Malmquist bias has appeared in the literature clearly referring to different types of bias and statistical effect. The most common of these other uses is to refer to an effect that takes place with a magnitude limited sample, but in this case the low absolute magnitude objects are overrepresented. In a sample with a magnitude limit, there will be a margin of error near that boundary where objects that should be bright enough to make the cut are excluded and objects that are slightly below the limit are instead included. Since low absolute magnitude objects are more common than brighter ones, and since these dimmer galaxies are more likely to be below the cutoff line and scattered up, while the brighter ones are more likely to be above the line and scattered down, an over-representation of the lower luminosity objects result.

It is the busiest summer resort in Lithuania and has beaches of sand (18 km, 11 miles long and up to 300 metres, 1000ft wide) and sand dunes. Officially Palanga has the status of a city municipality and includes ≈†ventoji, Nemirseta, B≈´tingƒó and other settlements, which are considered as part of the city of Palanga. Legend According to a legend, there was a pagan shrine at the foot of a hill in Palanga where a beautiful priestess named Birutƒó used to tend the ceremonial fires. Having heard of Birutƒó's beauty, Kƒôstutis, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, came to make her his wife. It is written in the Lithuanian Bychowiec Chronicle that Birutƒó \\"did not consent, and answered that she had promised the gods to remain a virgin as long as she lived. Kƒôstutis then resorted to take her by force, and with great pomp brought her back to his capital, Trakai, where he invited his kinsmen and celebrated with a lavish wedding...\\" Kƒôstutis was later murdered and Birutƒó returned to Palanga and resumed serving at the shrine until her death. The legend claimed that she was buried in the hill which is now named after her. History Liepojos-Vytauto streets 1899‚Äì1925‚Äì2010 Ti≈°keviƒçiai Palace park German: resort house) Not far from ≈†ventoji, archaeologists discovered an encampment which indicates that the area was inhabited some 5,000 years ago. Between the 10th and 13th centuries Palanga had been one of the main settlements of Mƒìguva Land, inhabited by the Curonians. Situated upon the trail of the ancient Amber Road, it became a center of trade and crafts. In historical documents the name of Palanga was first mentioned in 1161 when the King Valdemar I of Denmark disembarked there with his army and captured the castle of the Curonians. Between the 13th and 15th centuries, the inhabitants of Palanga had to confront the Teutonic Knights in the south and the Livonian Brothers of the Sword in the north. Their adversaries were unable to achieve their goal of capturing the Lithuanian sea-coast from Klaipƒóda to ≈†ventoji. Although Klaipƒóda (Memel) passed into the hands of the German feudal lords under the Treaty of Melno, in 1422, Palanga and ≈†ventoji remained under Lithuanian control. The two towns gradually developed into harbours and even greater centers of trade. British merchants established enterprises in ≈†ventoji in 1685. During the Great Northern War, the Swedish Army ravaged Palanga, destroyed the harbour at ≈†ventoji, and blocked up the entrance with rocks in 1701. After the Third Partition of Poland and Lithuania in 1795 Lithuania became a part of Russian Empire. In 1819 Palanga came from Vilna Governorate to Grobin County of Courland Governorate. Palanga was purchased in 1824 by Count Mykolas Ti≈°keviƒçius. His grandson Juozas Ti≈°keviƒçius built a pier and engaged ships to transport passengers and bricks to nearby LiepƒÅja. Palanga began to develop as a resort in the early 19th century. The pier has been a favourite spot for taking a stroll and other recreation since 1892. Juozas Ti≈°keviƒçius's son, Feliksas Ti≈°keviƒçius, commissioned the construction of the neo-renaissance Ti≈°keviƒçiai Palace, built by the famous German architect Franz Schwechten in 1897. The French landscape architect √âdouard Andr√© designed a large park around the palace, between 1897 and 1907. The palace became a favourite gathering place for concert performances. Amongst the good friends and associates of Feliksas Ti≈°keviƒçius was the notary, Jonas Kentra. Following the Lithuanian press ban of 1864, Palanga became an important location for the smuggling of Lithuanian publications from the west. The Rev. Marcijonas Jurgaitis, physician Liudas Vaineikis, and notary Jonas Kentra, played significant roles in this activity. After Kentra obtained official permission, a public performance featuring the comedy, America in the Bathhouse (Amerika pirtyje), was performed in the Lithuanian language. This had previously not been permitted. However, later the Tsarist authorities deported Vaineikis and twenty-five other people to Siberia in 1901. In 1919, after the breakup of the Russian Empire, Palanga became a part of Latvia, like the rest of the Courland Governorate. In 1921 the town was peacefully transferred to Lithuania following a Lithuanian-Latvian treaty and giving Lithuania access to the sea.Latvijas ieg≈´tƒÅs un zaudƒìtƒÅs teritorijas, NeoGeolv, November 10, 2011] In June and August 1941, hundreds of local Jews were executed in the Forest of Palanga.http://yahadmap.org/#village/palanga- klaip-da-lithuania.970 The Ti≈°keviƒçiai Palace's park was converted into a botanical garden in 1960. Today it contains two hundred different types of trees and shrubs, including an oak tree planted by President Antanas Smetona. The palace, now the Palanga Amber Museum, has an extensive collection of amber jewelry and other artifacts. Symphonic concerts as well as other musical festivals and events take place in the summer, usually in the evening. Location Palanga is a resort town through which the ≈†ventoji and RƒÖ≈æƒó (Samogitian: Ron≈æƒì) Rivers flow into the Baltic Sea. RƒÖ≈æƒó was formerly known as Alanga and gave Palanga its name: Palanga which literally means on the Alanga River. The Palanga municipality extends 24 kilometers from Nemirseta in the south to the Latvian border in the north. Palanga is subdivided to Nemirseta, Vanagupƒó, Kunigi≈°kiai, Manci≈°kiai, and ≈†ventoji ‚Äì five neighboring fishermen villages which were united into one city following administrative changes to the area. During the time when the Klaipƒóda Region was part of Germany, Nemirseta was the northernmost village of East Prussia; conversely Palanga was a border checkpoint between Russian Lithuania and Germany. Transportation Basanaviƒçiaus street Twilight near Palanga pier The municipality is accessed by roads from Klaipƒóda and ≈†iauliai. There are no railroads in the municipality (the closest rail connection is in Kretinga, the capital of the Kretinga district municipality). Palanga's International Airport, the third largest in Lithuania, offers connecting flights to Scandinavia, Germany, United Kingdom, Poland and to the biggest city in Baltic States - Riga, Latvia. The airport is located between Palanga and ≈†ventoji, and it handles more flights in the summer due to the resort nature of the municipality. Places of interest The pier in Palanga Path heading to the beach In the summer, a multitude of tourists stay in Palanga, both for its beaches and to enjoy the maritime atmosphere. There is a carnival centered on Jonas Basanaviƒçius Street, which is a pedestrian-only thoroughfare during the high season. There are dozens of restaurants, bars, rides, and other forms of entertainment. The aforementioned Palanga Amber Museum is open to the public, as are as the museum's extensive botanical gardens. Anaiƒçiai Ethnographic Cemetery holds a collection of 19th- and early 20th-century graves. In the Sculptures Garden, one can find 28 contemporary Art statues by artists from Armenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine. Also found in Palanga is one of the oldest operating pharmacies in Lithuania. It was established in the mid-19th century. The city is also home to a regional radio station, FM Palanga.

Adaptation The book was also adapted in 1977 as the episode \\"The Flickering Torch Mystery\\" for the 1977 Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries TV series. The story, again, was completely re-written, involving the Hardy Brothers looking for a missing sound engineer in an investigation that uncovers a plot to kill rock star Tony Eagle (played by Ricky Nelson). Unfortunately, they wrongly conclude it was to be attempted through a bomb placed on stage during a concert, and their desperate interruption of it to destructively search for the bomb turns out be an embarrassing fiasco that finds nothing. Later, they uncover the true method of the murder attempt, but no one believes them until they are forced to trust their instincts and stop Eagle's departure on his private plane. Once accomplished, they convince Eagle to allow a search of the plane and they discover not only the missing sound engineer tied up and hidden inside, but also a hidden radio transmitter designed to interfere with the plane's navigational equipment so the plane would go hopelessly off course and crash in the ocean when its fuel is exhausted. Some aspects of the book remained (the Hardys investigating the disappearance of a pilot), but one of the subplots, Frank & Joe having their own rock band and about to make their debut performance, was moved to another episode, \\"Mystery of the Flying Courier\\".

The rebels also claimed to be acting over other causes including bad governance, and religion in the name of the Scottish Reformation. As the government and rebel forces moved back and forth across Scotland without fighting, the conflict became known as the \\"chase about raid.\\" Queen Mary's forces were superior and the rebel lords fled to England where Queen Elizabeth censured the leader. Background There were fears that her marriage to Darnley signaled a return to Roman Catholicism. Moray is reported to have declared that he aimed at nothing else than \\"the maintenance of the true religion.\\" Moray's faction of nobles and lairds now included the Duke of Ch√¢telherault, the Earls of Argyll, Glencairn, and Rothes, and several lairds from Fife and Ayrshire. He had the support of John Knox.Jenny Wormald, Mary, Queen of Scots: Politics, Passion and a Kingdom Lost (London, 2001), p. 154.

Nicolas Elphinstone is said to have obtained ¬£10,000 from England for them.David Laing, History of the Reformation by John Knox, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1848), p. 496. Mary set out from Holyroodhouse to Linlithgow and Stirling on 26 August 1565 to move to Glasgow and confront them. Her cannon followed, brought by John Chisholm, who had obtained funds from the Burgh of Edinburgh after Mary promised the town rights over Leith.Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh: 1557-1571 (Edinburgh, 1875), p. 228. The comptroller of the Scottish exchequer, John Wishart of Pitarrow, had sided with the rebellion and was replaced by William Murray of Tullibardine. The Provost of Edinburgh was also removed and Simon Preston of Craigmillar, a friend of Mary put in his place. Mary restored the honours of Lord Gordon as Earl of Huntly to ensure his support. The English diplomat Thomas Randolph claimed theiving and murder were rife, William Murray's lands were raided by Highlanders.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 198, 203. Thomas Randolph heard, but was sceptical, that Mary herself carried a pistol in her hand near while riding near Hamilton. Only one of one her ladies in waiting followed her. Darnley wore a \\"gylte corslet\\", while the rest of the army wore jacks which were usual worn in Scotland. Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 202. The rebels left Hamilton, and Mary's force, nearby, turned to follow them and in stormy weather several of her followers were drowned in a flood on the way to Callendar.David Laing, History of the Reformation by John Knox, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1848), pp. 500-1. On 31 August, Moray and his supporters arrived in Edinburgh with 1,000 or 1,200 men. The English diplomat Thomas Randolph doubted that this force could withstand the Queen and King's army, as they lacked \\"harquebusiers,\\" soldiers with hand- guns. Edinburgh Castle was held for the Queen and began to shoot its cannon at the rebels in the town.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 198-201. The rebel lords left Edinburgh. Mary came back to Edinburgh from Glasgow in early September and retired to Stirling Castle. Moray and his followers contemplated making for Carlisle in England. She visited Glasgow on 8 September, then on 9 September went to St Andrews securing Castle Campbell and Lochleven Castle on the way. She went on to Dundee and Perth, then back to Glasgow.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1905), pp. 202-5. Moray's supporters retreated to Dumfries.

Moray in England The rebels crossed the border at Carlisle, then made their way to Newcastle upon Tyne. Moray decided to go to London, and got as far as Royston in Hertfordshire, until he received a letter from Elizabeth I of England to stop as he was not invited and a rebel against his own queen. He was then brought to Westminster on 23 October 1565 to explain himself to Elizabeth and the French ambassadors. Moray had hoped his pregnant wife Agnes Keith would join him in England, sailing in Charles Wilson's ship.

Plot summary Innocently responding to a motorist's request that they shut off a light at his home, the Hardy Boys discover a deep mystery: the man used the name of a man, John Mead, that Chief Collig claims died five years earlier in a car accident. Adding to the mystery, the Mead mansion's doors have neither knobs nor visible keyholes. Only after speaking to a locksmith do they learn that the locks were concealed. Meanwhile, their father Fenton assigns them to investigate a lead in the kidnapping of a doctor that may lead down the trail to a local boy who fell in with a local thief, a master criminal, who's a relation to the boy. The Hardy boys are to locate a traffic signal that hums like someone singing faintly, and drive ten minutes from it in each direction, then investigate the area for a \\"secret panel\\". Fenton's mystery ends up intertwining with the Mead mansion and the master criminal, who's been carrying out a series of break-ins and thefts without triggering the alarm systems. It turns out that the deceased Mr. Mead was an electronics genius who developed a device that could open any lock and defeat alarm systems, but asked that, upon his death, it be turned over to the FBI. The master criminal had befriended Mr. Mead, found out about the device, and stolen it.

Biography Kumarin was born in Tambov, after compulsory military service he came to Leningrad to study. In the 1980s he served his first sentence for possession of arms and forged documents. Thereafter he met a compatriot from Tambov, Valery Ledovskikh with whom he founded a gang. The gang initially invited only persons from Tambov region (thus its name - Tambovskaya). Being not yet strong enough to operate independently the gang merged into the large criminal group Velikolukskaya (from Velikie Luki, Pskov region) and was engaged mostly in commercial racket. In 1989 multiple Kumarin's gang members were convicted for the bloody firefight with another criminal gang, Malyshevskaya. The verdict was rather mild, supposedly because the state prosecutor was severely injured by the unknown persons during the investigation. After having completed a short sentence, Kumarin's gang has swiftly taken over racket all across the North-Western region of Russia - Leningrad, Pskov, Novgorod, Karelia - challenging the business affairs of his former 'host gang'. A bloody skirmish with Velikolukskaya gang caused Kumarin to fall into a month-long coma. His right arm had to be amputated at the shoulder and bullets pierced his stomach, chest and lungs. To this day he still has bullet fragments in his heart.The Times - Russia's 'Al Capone' sneers at his trial During mid-1990-ties Kumarin attempted to legalize the criminal earnings of his gang using the extensive contacts with the government of St. Petersburg city headed by mayor Anatoly Sobchak (1991-1996), to whom the current Russian President Vladimir Putin served as assistant.J√ºrgen Roth, Die Gangster aus dem Osten, Europa Verlag Publishers Kumarin was an investor to the Kirishinefteorgsintez (–ö–∏—Ä–∏—à–∏–Ω–µ—Ñ—Ç–µ–æ—Ä–≥—Å–∏–Ω—Ç–µ–∑) oil refinery and member of the Board of Petersburg Fuel Company (PTK) controlled by Kumarin. PTK became the sole supplier of gasoline to the municipal transport of St. Petersburg. Since late 1990-ties few senior members of Kumarin's structures as well as of its adversaries were killed and a row of investigations of his past criminal affairs was published. In June 2003, the magazine Der Spiegel mentioned that, according to the German ministry of criminal affairs, the German firm St. Petersburg Real Estate Holding Company () (SPAG) had fallen under suspicion of being involved in a money laundering scheme through the Cali cocaine cartel with connections to Kumarin. Russian co-owner of the SPAG's joint venture was the government of Saint-Petersburg and Vladimir Putin, then the municipal official, was a member of the board from 1992 to 2000. In April 2004 German police interrogated Kumarin but no indictments were made. It has been suggested that Kumarin maintained good relations to Russian politicians Mikhail Glushenko and Alexander Filatov. Allegedly after refusing to back down from a business deal in favour of a politician close to Vladimir Putin, Kumarin was raided and arrested by 300 special forces officers on August 24, 2007. Prosecutor General Yury Chaika accused him of banditry and organizing a gang.–ì–µ–Ω–ø—Ä–æ–∫—É—Ä–æ—Ä –ß–∞–π–∫–∞: ¬´–ü–µ—Ä–µ–¥ –ö—É–º–∞—Ä–∏–Ω—ã–º –≤—Å–µ –¥–µ–ª–∞–ª–∏ ¬´–ö—É¬ª He was also accused of the murder attempt on businessman Sergei Vasiliev, a rival in the oil business. In 2006, two men with automatic rifles sprayed Vasiliev's car with gunfire, wounding him and killing one of his bodyguards. Kumarin sought to clean up his image via donations to charities and the Russian Orthodox Church of which he was a devout follower as well as securing the release of two kidnapped children of Sergey Borodulin, Russian businessman. During this period his celebrity grew as well, dozens of celebrities and politicians attended his 50th birthday party in 2006. Kumarin was interviewed by Andrey Konstantinov, author of book Bandit Petersburg. Since 2004 Kumarin-Barsukov served as assistant to the St.Petersburg municipal MP, Alexander Nevzorov, well-known Russian journalist, who endorsed Kumarin as the \\"perfectly clean person\\" and invited Kumarin to play the role of King Louis XIV in his film. During the 1990-ties, however, Nevzorov covered multiple raids of Kumarin's gang in prime-time TV shows making the gang notorious among the public. After the 2007-2009 investigation Kumarin was sentenced to 14 years in prison plus a fine for the episodes of racket, fraud, money laundering and a murder attempt. The verdict was challenged in the European Court of Human Rights and by 2011 his sentence was reduced by 2.5 years. In 2012 another long investigation of Kumarin's affairs starts. Kumarin was accused of contracting a killing of Galina Starovoitova. Main witness against Kumarin was Mikhail Glushenko a.k.a. Misha-Khokhol, who in turn was in 2015 sentenced for 17 years in prison for arranging of the murder of Starovoitova. In March 2019, he was sentenced by the Court of St. Petersburg to 24 years in prison for creating The Tambov Gang.

It was the plantation house of four generations of the Lee family of Virginia (with descendants later to expand to Maryland and other states). Stratford Hall is the boyhood home of two signers of the Declaration of Independence, Richard Henry Lee (1732‚Äì1794), and Francis Lightfoot Lee (1734‚Äì1797). Stratford Hall is also the birthplace of Robert Edward Lee (1807‚Äì1870), who served as General-in-Chief of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). The Stratford Hall estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960, under the care of the National Park Service in the U.S. Department of the Interior. History Thomas Lee, builder Colonel Thomas Lee (1690‚Äì1750) was a Virginian who served as acting Governor of the colony and was a strong advocate for westward expansion. Lee purchased the land for Stratford Hall in 1717, aware of its agricultural and commercial potential as a waterfront site. Construction of the Georgian Great House did not begin until the late 1730s. Designed by an unknown architect, the brick Great House is a two-story H-shaped structure, surrounded on four corners by attending outbuildings, all of which still stand today. Following construction of the Great House, Thomas Lee expanded the site into a bustling hive of activity, and soon the working plantation became \\"a towne in itself\\" as one visitor to Stratford marveled. A wharf on the Potomac River was the destination for a large number of merchant ships, a grist mill ground wheat and corn there, and slaves and indentured servants farmed tobacco and other crops on the thousands of acres of farmland. Blacksmiths, coopers, carpenters, tailors, gardeners, and weavers plied their trades at Thomas Lee's Stratford. Stratford Hall is set in the Historic Northern Neck of Virginia, a rural peninsula where historic Christ Church is located 50 miles southeast. In the midst of this busy world, Thomas Lee and his wife Hannah Harrison Ludwell (1701‚Äì1749) raised eight children, six sons and two daughters. They played important roles in shaping the early history of the nation. His eldest son, Philip Ludwell Lee Sr., Esquire (1727‚Äì1775) inherited Stratford Hall. Richard Henry Lee (1732‚Äì1794) and Francis Lightfoot Lee (1734‚Äì1797) were delegates from Virginia to the Second Continental Congress, and signers of the Declaration of Independence. Richard Henry was later instrumental in guiding the fledgling nation, serving as President of Congress in 1784-85. Thomas Ludwell Lee, active in local politics, served as a Virginian legislator and helped compose the Virginia Declaration of Rights. William Lee (1739‚Äì1795) and Dr. Arthur Lee (1740‚Äì1792) were diplomats to England during the turbulent struggle for American independence. Hannah Lee was an early proponent of women's rights, and Alice Lee married the prominent physician William Shippen Jr. (1736‚Äì1808) of Philadelphia. Philip Ludwell Lee Sr. (1727‚Äì1775), a member of the House of Burgesses and the King's Council, continued to expand the plantation after he inherited Stratford until it eventually encompassed almost . A lover of horses and music, Philip and his wife Elizabeth Steptoe (1743‚Äì1789) had two daughters, the oldest of them known as the \\"divine Matilda\\". Philip died in 1775, and Elizabeth remarried in 1780 to Philip Richard Fendall I (1734‚Äì1805). The new couple continued to reside at Stratford Hall with her two daughters and her son-in-law (and later a hero of the Revolutionary War, Henry \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee (1756‚Äì1818), who had married her daughter Matilda. An arrangement was reached in 1784-1785 that the Fendalls would turn over their rights to Stratford Hall, and Henry would sell a one-half acre lot situated on Oronoco Street in Alexandria, Virginia for 300 pounds. It was there that Philip R. Fendall built the Lee-Fendall House. Matilda inherited Stratford Hall in this agreement and lived there with her husband Harry and her second cousin, but the couple's time together was cut short when Matilda died after eight years of marriage. House Slave Quarters at Stratford Hall Plantation Several years passed before \\"Light Horse Harry\\" remarried to Ann Hill Carter (1773‚Äì1827) of Shirley Plantation. Their fourth child, Robert Edward Lee (1807‚Äì1870), was born at Stratford Hall in 1807. Robert E. Lee spent only his first four years at Stratford Hall, yet remembered it fondly for the remainder of his life. In the middle of the Civil War, Lee wrote his wife that \\"In the absence of a home I wish I could purchase Stratford. That is the only place I could go to, now accessible to us, that would inspire me with feelings of pleasure and local love. You and the girls could remain there in quiet. It is a poor place, but we could make enough cornbread and bacon for our support and the girls could weave us clothes. I wonder if it is for sale and at how much.\\" Light Horse Harry fell heavily into debt and eventually served a two-year term in debtors prison. Anne Carter Lee and the children departed from Stratford Hall during the winter of 1810-11, and moved to Alexandria. Stratford Hall passed into the hands of Harry and Matilda's surviving son Major Henry Lee IV \\"Black Horse\\" (1787‚Äì1837), but financial troubles and personal scandal forced him to sell the plantation several years later. =After the Lees= East side of Stratford Hall (looking through the East Garden) Stratford Hall remained in private hands for more than a century. William C. Somerville of Maryland purchased the property from Henry Lee IV in 1822. After his death his heirs discovered that obligations incurred by Henry Lee IV continued to encumber the property. The plantation was foreclosed in 1828 and purchased by Henry D. Storke of Westmoreland County, who was married to Elizabeth \\"Besty\\" McCarty, sister of Henry Lee IV's wife, Anne Robinson McCarty.Nagel, Paul C. \\"The Lees of Virginia: Seven Generations of an American Family\\" p 251 Besty Storke lived on the property until her death in 1879 and was buried there. In 1929, a group of women dedicated to preserving the memory of Robert E. Lee and the Lee family joined together to form the Robert E. Lee Memorial Association and purchased Stratford Hall from the Storkes' heirs. The site is maintained by the Association and is open to the public.

Between 1959 and 1973 the first 38 volumes of this series were systematically revised as part of a project directed by Harriet Adams, Edward Stratemeyer's daughter.The Hardy Boys Online: Revisions The original version of this book was shortened in 1970 by Priscilla Baker-Carr resulting in two similar stories sharing the same title. Plot summary The Hardy brothers embark on a freighter trip under mysterious circumstances and find themselves involved with a smuggling ring. The Hardy Boys discover that the Phantom Freighter is really a smuggling ship used to smuggle counterfeit documents, illegal drugs, cowhides, and electric motors. =Aunt Gertrude's carton= Enigmatic stranger Thaddeus McClintock arrives in Bayport and engages Frank and Joe Hardy to arrange for a relaxing trip for him (with the Boys to accompany him) with the mysterious promise of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay all expenses and when the trip is over you‚Äôll be paid. Money, if you like. Or something else.‚Äù Meanwhile, Aunt Gertrude has arrived and announced that she is going to be living in the Hardy household long term. The shipping company incorrectly delivers one of her cartons, delivering instead a box apparently of raw wool addressed to a Mr. Johnson to the Hardy‚Äôs address. After expressing her anger at the shipping company as the carton contains valuable family papers, Aunt Gertrude sends the boys to the address marked on the box to swap the packages. Arriving at the remote farm, the boys find nobody home but the barn ablaze. Frank breaks into the barn to rescue a carton believed to be Aunt Gertrude‚Äôs, only to find out it contained discarded newspapers. The owner of the barn arrives and is shocked to find that someone had been staying at his house and having packages delivered while he was out of town. After getting a description of the man who signed for the package from the delivery driver, the boys spot a man matching that description at a clothing store and follow him to the docks where he disappears. =Going fishing= Later, after reviewing several other modes of travel with Mr. McClintock, the boys suggest a cruise on an oceangoing freighter, to which Mr. McClintock is receptive. The boys then try repeatedly to book passage on freighters scheduled through Bayport, but are rebuffed at every turn. The travel agency they attempted to work through, owned by Mr. Klack, seems more interested in keeping them off ships than arranging their passage. Even when the boys are successful at obtaining tickets through an out-of-town travel agency, an unknown individual posing to act on their behalf picks up their tickets, again preventing them from setting sail. At the suggestion of loyal Hardy friend Chet Morton (who is trying his hand at fly-tying), the boys and Mr. McClintock employ local fishing captain Harkness to take them on a fishing expedition. Captain Harkness agrees to take the trip, provided they avoid Barmet Shoals as he recently spotted a phantom freighter there that left him spooked and shaken. After landing a monstrous tuna to the delight of Mr. McClintock and heading back to Bayport, their boat runs out of gas to the disbelief of Captain Harkness. As night falls, the party on the boat is horrified to see a freighter cutting through the sea toward them, only to go silent and dark. Though the boys try hard to locate the ship, it is neither heard or sighted again and has disappeared by first light. Rescue comes from a coastal patrol aircraft and ship the next day. =Mysteries in Bayport= Meanwhile, numerous other break-ins are discovered in and around Bayport during which nothing was stolen from unoccupied houses, but packages are delivered and signed for by people unknown to the owners. Fenton Hardy reveals that he is working on a case of forged historical documents which have been appearing in the rare document trade. Aunt Gertrude takes a trip to Bridgewater, evasively answering questions about where and why she is going. The boys follow her to Bridgewater and find her meeting with an elderly woman the boys previously identified as one of the people involved in the package delivery scheme. The boys summon the local police who arrest the woman (who is selling some of the contents of Aunt Gertrude‚Äôs carton back to her) and search her motel room, finding more stolen property. =Taking a cruise= The boys recruit their friend Biff Hooper to help them book passage, which turns to their advantage as an out-of-town travel agent arranges their cruise aboard the Father Neptune. Meeting Captain Gramwell of the Father Neptune, the boys learn that one crew member recently left the ship ill and a new hand had been hired. Suspicious, the boys investigate and find the crewman had in fact been kidnapped and the new hand was sent to interrupt the trip. Captain Gramwell reacts quickly and has the new crewman, recognized by the boys as part of the smuggling ring, arrested and questioned to find his missing crewman, who is recovered. Mr. McClintock, the boys, Biff, and Chet board the Father Neptune in Southport. At sea, the cargo aboard the Father Neptune suddenly shifts, leaving the ship listing badly and in danger of sinking. The crew and passengers rush to redistribute the cargo, eventually restoring the ship upright. The boys tell Captain Gramwell about the smuggling ring and phantom ship. Captain Gramwell has the ship‚Äôs radio operator contact all the ships in the area and discovers that the Lion Tamer spotted just such a ship nearby. Spotting the ship at nightfall, the Father Neptune pursues the mystery ship, identified as the Black Gull, but is unable to overtake it, much to the frustration of Captain Gramwell as the Father Neptune is declared to be the fastest ship in those waters and the mystery ship is obviously older and slower. That night, the mystery ship is again sighted, dark and apparently adrift. Along with the Father Nepture's radio operator Sparks, the boys row over to the ship while the Father Neptune keeps a spotlight on the mystery ship to hide the rowboat. This scene is depicted on the cover of the book. Upon boarding the mystery ship, the party finds the ship seemingly abandoned, but are suddenly jumped by the ship‚Äôs crew and captured. =Captivity= Held captive with Sparks aboard the Black Gull by the chief smuggler Crowfoot, the boys pretend to cast in with the smuggler. Crowfeet tells the boys about the ship‚Äôs secret repeller belts around the hull which hold off any motorized vessel or aircraft, allowing the Black Gull (under many different names) to escape from much faster ships and explaining how the boys adrift in the fishing boat were able to get so close with the fishing boat's engine shut down due to fuel exhaustion. After the Black Gull's radio operator falls ill, Crowfeet presses a seemingly reluctant Sparks into service to send messages. The boys then take turns sending coded messages via innocent-sounding nursery rhymes to their father, including the line ‚Äúsailing, sailing, over the bounding main, for many a sailing ship can go faster‚Ä¶‚Äù. Soon a sleek racing sloop under full sail (immune to the effects of the repeller which only affects motor vessels) approaches and quickly overtakes the slow freighter. Coast Guard officers board and rescue the boys, Sparks, and the captured scientists who had been kidnapped and forced to work for the smuggler. Among them is a chemist who had developed the techniques used to artificially age paper to supply forged documents for sale in the antique / rare document market. The elderly ‚Äúsmuggler‚Äù Mitchell turns out to be Mr. McClintock's former business partner and is happily reunited with Mr. McClintock aboard the Father Neptune. With Mitchell rescued, the entire design for the repeller belt is recovered and Mr. McClintock and Mitchell agree to turn the design over to the US Government. The boys, Chet, Biff, and Mr. McClintock then continue their cruise to the Caribbean. The reader is left with a note that the Hardy Boys next mystery will be The Secret of Skull Mountain.

History Around 1140 the lands of Beadlow Manor were granted to the priory at Millbrook in Hertfordshire, from where the community were moved upon the establishment of the new priory at Beadlow, Bedfordshire, England about 10 km south of Bedford. Initially referred to as Beaulieu Priory, it remained cell of the Abbey at St Albans. Poverty made the community unsustainable and in 1428 the monks left the priory, which became absorbed into St Albans Abbey. In 1434 the ownership of the priory passed to the Crown, whilst the site was finally abandoned as a monastic settlement in 1435. The decay of the buildings ensued after this time, and by 1908 there existed no intact above-ground remains. From 1963 to 1965 archaeological excavations unearthed the foundations as well as artifacts dating to the 12th to 15th centuries. The establishment was close to Chicksands Priory.

Minor characters include a local engineer named Bob Carpenter, his assistant Dick Ames, and the Hardy Boys' friend, Chet Morton. A local plumber, Kleng, organizes the crime with the support of the Chicago syndicate to drain the water from the reservoir, in order to keep local engineers from flooding their hideout. Timothy Kimball Jr. (Sweeper) is being paid to help carry out the plan. Dr. Foster, who was treated very badly, is another character who was kidnapped by Kleng's gang to test the tunnel in the mountain to see if enough cesium is present to justify mining it.

It is located about 2 km south of the Middle Kingdom tombs at Beni Hasan, and about 28 km south of Al Minya. Today, the site is a small village known as Istabl Antar. There are two temples here, both of which are dedicated to Pakhet. They are cut out of the rock into the cliffs on the eastern side of the Nile. One of the temples, built by the pharaoh Hatshepsut, has an architrave bearing a long dedicatory text with her famous denunciation of the Hyksos.Speos Artemidos Inscription of Hatshepsut, based on the work of James P. Allen Nearby is a small shrine bearing the name of Alexander IV of Macedon. An earlier temple was probably located here, but no traces older than that of Hatshepsut have been found. The decorations inside have been usurped by Seti I in places, his name replacing that of Hatshepsut. Cut from the living rock, Hatshepsut's temple is composed of two chambers connected by a short passageway. The outer portico is rectangular and originally had eight stone columns arranged in two rows Unfortunately, only three of the four columns forming the facade are still relatively intact and none of the internal pillars remain. The rock face above the external pillars of the portico is dressed and inscribed with text bearing Hatshesput's name. It includes the famous text in which she denounces the Hyksos and records her actions in rebuilding the damage they had caused thus legitimising her own reign. Within the portico only the southern wall bears any inscription. The text originally referred to Hatshepsut but was usurped by Seti I who also added further dedications.p12-13 Fairman, H.W and Grdseloff, B (1947) The smaller inner sanctuary is square with a statue niche at the back. It was not inscribed by Hatshepsut and Brand has suggested that it was in fact Seti who first excavated the passageway and sanctuary.P54 Brand (2000) Seti altered the text to replace Hatshepsut's name with his own and changed representations of the Queen to depictions of himself, but Fairman and Grdseloff argued that there was no clear evidence that Tuthmosis III defaced the chapel when he was expunging her name from other monuments late in his reign despite the existence of his name on some of the pillars of the portico. This conclusion is queried by Brand who suggests that an image of the queen had been vandalised by Tuthmosis and later recarved to depict Seti. Likewise Fairman and Grdseloff did not find evidence that Akhenaten had defaced the name of Amun but Brand concluded that Seti had repaired this damage and notes at least one instance where an earlier version of one of the arms of Amun was still visible. Brand notes that Seti also replaced an image of a priest with that of the god Thoth and concludes that this was the result of the increasing influence of this god's temple in Hermopolis during the reign of Seti. Finally Brand notes that Seti added three scenes to the depictions of the coronation of Hatshepsut but (contrary to Fairman and Grdseloff) found no evidence that he had usurped these scenes from Hatshepsut.Fairman and Grdseloff 1947:13, Brand 2000:55-56 References Further reading * Fakhry, Ahmed, A new speos from the reign of Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III at Beni-Hasan, In: Annales du Service des Antiquit√©s de l‚Äô√âgypte, Issue 39 (1939), S. 709 ‚Äì 723 * Brand, Peter James (2000) The monuments of Seti I: epigraphic, historical, and art historical analysis * Gardiner, Alan Henderson, Davies‚Äôs copy of the great Speos Artemidos inscription, In: Journal of Egyptian Archaeology Issue 32 (1946), S. 43 ‚Äì 56 * Fairman, H.

The company was purchased by G. P. Putnam's Sons in 1982 and today is part of Penguin Random House through its subsidiary Penguin Group. Today, through the Penguin Group, they publish approximately 170 titles a year, including licensed children's books for such properties as Miss Spider, Strawberry Shortcake, Super WHY!, Charlie and Lola, Nova the Robot, Weebles, Bratz, Sonic X, The Wiggles, and Atomic Betty. Grosset & Dunlap also publishes Dick and Jane children's books and, through Platt & Munk, The Little Engine That Could. History The company was founded in 1898 by Alexander Grosset and George T. Dunlap. It was originally primarily a hardcover reprint house. In 1907, Grosset & Dunlap acquired Chatterton & Peck, who had a large children's list including the Stratemeyer Syndicate. Grosset & Dunlap is historically known for its photoplay editions and juvenile series books such as the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, The Bobbsey Twins, Tom Swift, Cherry Ames and other books from their long partnership with the Stratemeyer Syndicate (currently owned by Simon & Schuster). After George T. Dunlap retired in 1944, Grosset & Dunlap was sold to a consortium of Random House; Little, Brown; Harper and Brothers; Scribners; and the Book-of-the-Month Club. In 1954, Grosset & Dunlap acquired McLoughlin Brothers. Grosset & Dunlap had an initial public offering in 1961, by which time the majority of the books published were children's books. Grosset & Dunlap launched the paperback reprint house Bantam Books in 1945 in cooperation with Curtis Publishing Company. In 1964, Grosset & Dunlap acquired full ownership of Bantam from Curtis. Grosset & Dunlap obtained permission from Little, Brown, to reprint Thornton Burgess's many children's books, and began issuing the Bedtime Stories series (20 books originally published 1913‚Äì1919, including such titles as The Adventures of Reddy Fox and The Adventures of Chatterer the Red Squirrel) in 1949. The original Little, Brown editions had plates of high quality paper for the illustrations, but the Grosset & Dunlap editions were to print the illustrations on the same stock as the text. They commissioned the original artist, Harrison Cady, to recreate the illustrations as line drawings appropriate for that type of paper, and to create many additional illustrations. Where the original Little, Brown editions had six full-page illustrations, the Grosset & Dunlap had 14 (fourteen) full-page drawings, plus many smaller drawings placed throughout the text. Cady had matured as an artist in the decades since the original Little, Brown illustrations. The line drawings he did for Grosset & Dunlap are simpler than the illustrations he had made for Little, Brown, and are generally more charming. The original Little, Brown illustrations better convey Cady's remarkable vision for Burgess' creatures.Thornton W. Burgess: A Descriptive Book Bibliography, Revised and Enlarged Edition, by Wayne W. Wright, The Thornton W. Burgess Society, 2000, page 40, and other misc. sources. Grosset & Dunlap published the Burgess books as hardcovers with dustjackets from 1949 to 1957, then as pink hardcovers without dust jackets from about 1962 into the 1970s. They issued them with library bindings in 1977. In most cases, the latest date printed anywhere in the book was from the early 1940s, so the Grosset & Dunlap editions are today often mistaken for being older than they are. In the 1980s, Little, Brown, owned by Penguin, canceled their permission for Grosset & Dunlap to publish the Burgess books. For most of the titles, the Harrison Cady illustrations commissioned by Grosset & Dunlap have never been published since then. An exception is the 2000 Dover edition of The Adventures of Paddy the Beaver, which has all of them (the illustrations in most of the Dover editions are not the Grosset & Dunlap commissions).Thornton W. Burgess: A Descriptive Book Bibliography, Revised and Enlarged Edition, by Wayne W. Wright, The Thornton W. Burgess Society, 2000, page 40, and other misc. sources. In 1968, Grosset & Dunlap was acquired by conglomerate National General, run by Gene Klein. National General was acquired by American Financial Group in 1973. In the 1970s and 1980s, the company's Charter Books (also known as Ace Charter) imprint published mystery fiction, most notably the Leslie Charteris series, The Saint. In 1974, Filmways bought the company from American Financial Group (Bantam was sold separately). During this time, Grosset & Dunlap acquired a new paperback publisher, Ace Books. Filmways sold Grosset & Dunlap to G. P. Putnam's Sons when Orion Pictures acquired Filmways in 1982. In 1978, the company drew a great deal of attention with its publication of RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon. The preparation of the book was alluded to briefly in the 2008 Oscar- nominated film Frost/Nixon, which chronicled and dramatized a series of interviews with the ex-president conducted by British television personality David Frost. Shortly after the aforementioned interviews aired among great publicity, the copy editor whom Grosset & Dunlap sent to San Clemente to work on the book with Nixon's staff was named David Frost. Grosset & Dunlap also published a series of literary classics which they called the Illustrated Junior Library. This series, published with colorful illustrations, included such titles as Heidi, an expurgated edition of Gulliver's Travels, Swiss Family Robinson, The Boy's King Arthur (published under the title King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table), and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (a 1956 reprinting of the 1944 edition with new illustrations by Evelyn Copelman, and published under the title The Wizard of Oz). This edition is still in print and may be a collectors item.https://www.amazon.com/dp/044840561X Putnam merged with Penguin Group in 1996 In 2013, Penguin merged with Bertelsmann's Random House, forming Penguin Random House. Today, Grosset & Dunlap's new juvenile series include Dish, Camp Confidential, Flirt (books), Katie Kazoo, Dragon Slayers' Academy, and Henry Winkler and Lin Oliver's Hank Zipzer series.

' (also ') is \\"unmanly\\" and ergi is \\"unmanliness\\"; the terms have cognates in other Germanic languages such as ', ', arag, arug, and so on. Ergi in the Viking Age To accuse another man of being ' was called scolding (see ') and thus a legal reason to challenge the accuser in holmgang. If holmgang was refused by the accused, he could be outlawed (full outlawry) as this refusal proved that the accuser was right and the accused was '. If the accused fought successfully in holmgang and had thus proven that he was not ', the scolding was considered what was in Old English called ', an unjustified, severe defamation, and the accuser had to pay the offended party full compensation. The Gray Goose Laws states: The Saleby Runestone uses the term ' in a curse. The practice of ' or \\"sorcery\\" was considered ' in the Viking Age and in Icelandic accounts and medieval Scandinavian laws, the term ' had connotations of a receptive, passive role of a freeborn man during homosexual intercourse. There are no written records of how the northern people thought of homosexuality before this conversion. The sociologist David F.

Judith Merril reported that although the novelisation suffered from \\"routine writing, stereotyped characters, and an apparent belief in the Ian Fleming school of international intrigue,\\" the scientists-protagonists were \\"anything but stereotyped,\\" and \\"a fair cross-section of the kinds of people who are attracted to scientific work.\\" Merril concluded that the clich√©d elements \\"provide a reasonably amusing background to a genuinely intriguing scientific puzzle.\\"\\"Books\\", F&SF;, May 1965, p.73 (parenthetical asides omitted) References  External links * * The Andromeda Breakthrough on Action TV * Andromeda book series at Goodreads Category:Andromeda Galaxy in fiction Category:BBC television dramas Category:British science fiction television shows Category:Television shows written by John Elliot (author) Category:1962 British television series debuts Category:Films with screenplays by Fred Hoyle Category:Black-and-white British television shows Category:1960s British drama television series Category:1960s British science fiction television series ","title":"The Andromeda Breakthrough"},{"id":"2073970","text":"The Secret of Pirates' Hill is Volume 36 in the original The Hardy Boys Mystery Stories published by Grosset & Dunlap.

Unlike a transient voltage suppression diodes, such as Transil, a Trisil acts as a crowbar device, switching ON when the voltage on it exceeds its breakover voltage.  Overview  A Trisil is bidirectional, behaving the same way in both directions. It is principally a voltage-controlled triac without gate. The behavior of a Trisil is similar to a SIDAC, but unlike SIDAC, Trisil devices are commonly used to protect circuits from overvoltage. They act faster and can handle more current. In 1982, the only manufacturer was Thomson SA; a successor company, ST Microelectronics continues to make the devices. This type of crowbar protector is widely used for protecting telecom equipment from lightning-induced transients and induced currents from power lines. Other manufacturers of this type of device include Bourns (TISP) and Littelfuse (SIDACtor). Rather than using the natural breakdown voltage of the device, an extra region is fabricated within the device to form a Zener diode. This allows a much tighter control of the breakdown voltage. It is also possible to make gated versions of this type of protector. In this case, the gate is connected to the telecom circuit power supply (via a diode or transistor) so that the device will crowbar if the transient exceeds the power supply voltage. The main advantage of this configuration is that the protection voltage tracks the power supply, thus eliminating the problem of selecting a particular breakdown voltage for the protection circuit.

It is also generally garnished with hard boiled eggs, fried plantains, herbs, parsley, and sometimes empanadas. The twelve beans represent the twelve apostles of Jesus, and the bacalao is symbolic of Jesus himself.

The original fleet was composed of three Cessna A208 Caravan 1. ARPA was the first investment of the TAM Group in Paraguay. At the beginning, ARPA had flights to the most important cities in Paraguay, like Ciudad del Este, Pedro Juan Caballero, Concepci√≥n and Encarnaci√≥n. Eventually, it also flew to Ayolas and Filadelfia (Chaco). In 1995, ARPA received a Cessna Citation II jet to compete with LADESA (L√≠neas A√©reas del Este S.A.)

The show features horror and science fiction films and is hosted by the eponymous character Svengoolie, who was originally played by Jerry G. Bishop from 1970 to 1973, before Rich Koz, succeeded him in the role from 1979 on. Before and after commercial breaks, Svengoolie presents sketches, tells jokes, and performs song parody spoofs related to the films being aired. The show is a long-running local program in the Chicago area and in recent years expanded nationally, airing Saturday nights on MeTV.  Format  The show airs both low-budget and classic horror and science-fiction movies, with host \\"Svengoolie\\" ‚Äì a telescoping of the words Svengali and ghoul ‚Äì played by Rich Koz (pronounced \\"Koze\\"), who wears thick skull-like makeup around his eyes and cheekbones, a moustache, goatee, and long wig, all black, and a black top hat with a tuxedo jacket over a bright red, open-collared, button-down shirt. Just before and after commercial breaks, Svengoolie presents sketches, tells corny jokes, and performs song parody spoofs of the film being aired. Some shows were presented in what was later dubbed \\"Sven-surround\\" ‚Äì a pun on \\"Sensurround\\", a brand name theater audio system ‚Äì in which Svengoolie would joke as the film aired sometimes with humorous sound effects. (The creators of Mystery Science Theater 3000 cited Svensurround as an inspiration.) This stunt was discontinued for a short time, then brought back due to viewer request, although as a clip segment aired outside the film. One relatively recent addition to the show is the simultaneous use of Twitter with the hashtag #svengoolie, allowing those watching to comment on the show. = Films = In August 2006, it was announced that WCIU had obtained broadcast rights to the classic Universal Monsters films of the 1930s and 1940s. These films had been requested since Svengoolie aired in the 1980s. By December 2006, the show featured four episodes of the Abbott and Costello \\"Meet\\" series, with Universal Studio Monsters and several Hammer Film Productions that were distributed by Universal-International. On May 5, 2007, Svengoolie presented Bela Lugosi's Dracula (1931), claiming it was the first time the movie had been shown on local television in more than a decade. = Themes = The show opens with a reference to early radio broadcasting: \\"Calling all stations, clear the air lanes, clear all air lanes for the big broadcast.\\" This is a sound clip from the preview \\"trailer\\" of one of the four \\"Big Broadcast Of .... (1932, 1936, 1937, 1938)\\" movies. In a running gag throughout the series, Svengoolie's mentions of the Chicago suburb of Berwyn are met with an audio clip of several people groaning \\"BERWYN?!?\\" Another recurring gag involves rubber chickens thrown at Svengoolie after a weak joke, usually at the end of an episode's opening and closing sketches. Visitors assist the crew in throwing rubber chickens during taping. Frequently sound clips are used from Warner Bros. cartoons (\\"Oh we're the boys of the Chorus,\\"...etc.), radio broadcasts of The Stan Freberg Show (\\"Thank you for all those cards and letters, you folks in television LAND.....\\", \\"Wun'erful, Wun'erful\\" and \\"Ow, OW, OW!!!\\" from \\"The HoneyEarthers\\"), and other sources.  Characters  * Svengoolie - the title character and host of the show, who introduces the film, tells jokes and relates trivia about the movie. The character was originally portrayed by former WCFL personality Jerry G. Bishop, who held the role from 1970 to 1973. When the show returned in 1979, Rich Koz took on the role of \\"Son of Svengoolie\\", which he portrayed until 1986, when the show was cancelled. In 1995, Koz was set to bring the show back and Bishop told him he was \\"all grown up\\" and could drop the \\"Son of\\" from his character name. Koz has been playing \\"Svengoolie\\" ever since. * Doug Graves - Svengoolie's accompanist, shown frequently at the piano or keyboard, though equally adept at the trumpet; Graves is played by musician and crew member Doug Scharf. * Zallman T. Tombstone (voiced by Rich Koz) - a smart-mouthed, disembodied skull that often acts as a foil for Svengoolie during comedy skits, with a voice based on Bill Saluga's Ray J. Johnson Jr. character. * Berwyn (voiced by Rich Koz) - a smart-aleck rubber chicken puppet who helps Svengoolie review viewer mail and photos. * Zelda (voiced by Jerry G. Bishop) - a smart-mouthed, disembodied skull (much like her successor, Tombstone) with a voice modeled after Flip Wilson's Geraldine Jones character. *Anita Exorcist - Saxophone player, appearing infrequently. Portrayed by Natalie Scharf. * Durwood the Dummy (voiced by Jerry G. Bishop (1970-1973), Rich Koz (1979-present)) - a wooden ventriloquist's dummy featured on the original series (1970‚Äì73), later carried over to the Son of Svengoolie series and retained from then on, though featured infrequently in recent years. Many other incidental characters throughout the show's run have been voiced by Rich Koz and‚Äîduring his tenure‚ÄîJerry G. Bishop, as well as WFLD staff announcer Jim Barton (during the \\"Son of\\" years).  Production  Rich Koz did most of the artwork for the show when he revived it as Son of Svengoolie at WFLD. For every episode, Koz researches the film to find interesting facts, then writes each episode, spending about four hours doing so. The camera shots and audio effects are handled by director Chris Faulkner and Kevin Reisberg, the show's assistant director. In 2014, the original casket prop used by both Bishop and Koz on camera was retired and donated to the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago.Museum of Broadcast Communications, Svengoolie Exhibit. Segments showcasing the original casket continued to be rebroadcast on the MeTV schedule. Rebroadcasts often will use improved prints of the films if they have become available, while keeping the old comedy skits.  Broadcast history  Jerry G. Bishop as the original \\"Svengoolie\\" The show's original title was Screaming Yellow Theater with host Svengoolie. The title was derived from Screaming Yellow Zonkers, a yellow, sugary glazed popcorn snack, first produced in the 1960s. It wasn't until the revival that the show was titled after the host's name. It debuted on September 18, 1970 on WFLD (Channel 32) and ran until late summer 1973. Svengoolie was played then by Jerry G. Bishop. In later seasons, Rich Koz ‚Äì a fan who sent in sketch ideas ‚Äì became a show writer. In 1973, Kaiser Broadcasting took over WFLD from Field Communications and Screaming Yellow Theater was cancelled and replaced with The Ghoul from Cleveland. The Ghoul lasted until 1974 when it was taken off the air. Field Communications took WFLD back from Kaiser Broadcasting in 1978, which led Jerry Bishop and Rich Koz to discuss the show's resurrection. On June 16, 1979, Son of Svengoolie debuted on WFLD, with Koz in the title role. The show also aired on Field Communications-controlled stations in Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco, and Detroit. The series ran until WFLD, then owned by Metromedia, was sold to Rupert Murdoch's Fox Television Stations Group in 1986 as part of the newly created Fox network. New management canceled the show, deciding that it did not fit the new programming direction. After 334 shows, the final episode aired January 25, 1986. Koz returned to WFLD in various capacities, mainly as the host of Fox Kids Club and The Koz Zone weekday afternoon children's programming, and appearing as an announcer on the Fox network's 1988 New Year's Eve broadcast. Neal Sabin, the executive vice president of Weigel Broadcasting, brought the show back on December 31, 1994 on WCIU (Channel 26), using \\"Svengoolie\\" as the name; Koz took the role of Svengoolie when Bishop told Koz that he \\"believed he was grown up enough now to no longer be just the Son.\\" Koz also hosts a weekly Three Stooges Stooge-a- palooza show on WCIU. The series was aired on Chicago's WWME-CA, Milwaukee stations WBME-CD and WMLW-TV, and occasionally on WMYS-LD in South Bend, Indiana. These stations are owned by Weigel Broadcasting. Beginning on April 2, 2011, Svengoolie's show became available nationally on the MeTV network through the efforts of Neal Sabin.  Reception  Between 1979 and 1986, Son of Svengoolie won three Chicago Emmys at station WFLD. For its 25th anniversary in 2004, Svengoolie was presented with the Silver Circle Award by the Chicago/Midwest Chapter of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for \\"outstanding contributions to Chicago television.\\" Svengoolie is also a consistent winner of the \\"Best Horror Host\\" award from the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards.\\"The Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards\\" A special four- part crossover story in two-page parts featuring Svengoolie with the various DC Comics superheroes ran through the month of October 2019. DC Comics editor Dan Didio said the idea for this was a \\"fun mash-up\\" featuring the Justice League alongside elements of the Svengoolie show.

Early years Margaret Tate was born in Wolverhampton, England, one of ten children of Jacob James Tate, a successful wine and spirit merchant and proprietor of public houses and later lodgings. Her parents were keen amateur musicians and opera enthusiasts. She was the sister of composer James W. Tate. Her family moved to London in 1898, where Teyte attended St. Joseph's Convent School, Snow Hill, and later studied at the Royal School of Music. Career Her father died in 1903 and she went to Paris the following year to become a pupil of the celebrated tenor Jean de Reszke. She made her first public appearance in Paris in 1906 when she sang Cherubino in The Marriage of Figaro and Zerlina in Don Giovanni, both conducted by Reynaldo Hahn. Her professional debut took place at the Opera House in Monte Carlo on 1 February 1907, where she performed Tyrcis in Myriame et Daphn√©Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), The Oxford Dictionary of Opera, (Andr√© Bloch's arrangement of Jacques Offenbach's Daphnis et Chlo√©), with Paderewski. The following week, again at the Opera House in Monte Carlo, she sang Zerlina. Finding that her surname was generally mispronounced in France, she changed it from Tate to Teyte before joining the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris. After a few small parts, she was cast as M√©lisande in Pell√©as et M√©lisande by Debussy, replacing the originator of the role, Mary Garden. To prepare for Pell√©as et M√©lisande, she studied with Debussy himself, and she is the only singer ever to be accompanied by Debussy on the piano with an orchestra in public (see Beau Soir). In 1910, Sir Thomas Beecham cast Teyte as Cherubino and M√©lisande and also as Blonde in Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail for his London season. Despite her early singing successes, Teyte did not easily establish herself in the main opera houses. Instead, she moved to America and performed with the Chicago Grand Opera Company from 1911‚Äì1914 and the Boston Opera Company from 1914‚Äì17, singing in Philadelphia and elsewhere, but not in New York, though she created the title role in Henry Kimball Hadley's opera, Bianca, at Manhattan's Park Theater in 1918. Returning to Britain in 1919, she created the r√¥le of Lady Mary Carlisle in Andr√© Messager's operetta, Monsieur Beaucaire, at the Prince's Theatre. She married for a second time in 1921, to Canadian millionaire Walter Sherwin Cottingham, and went into semi-retirement until 1930, when she performed as M√©lisande and played the title role in Puccini's Madama Butterfly. =Later years= After difficulty in reviving her career, she ended up performing music hall and variety (24 performances a week) at the Victoria Palace in London. Finally, in 1936, her recordings of Debussy songs accompanied by Alfred Cortot attracted attention, and recordings remained an important factor in her renewed fame, as she gained a reputation in England and the United States as the leading French art song interpreter of her time. She sang at the Royal Opera House in 1936‚Äì37 in Hansel and Gretel, as Eurydice in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice and as Butterfly in Madama Butterfly. In 1938‚Äì39 she broadcast performances of Massenet's Manon in English, with Heddle Nash as des Grieux, in addition to an ill-advised Eva in Wagner's Die Meistersinger. She also appeared in operetta and musical comedy between the wars. She made her first New York appearances in 1948, including a Town Hall recital followed by performances of Pell√©as at the New York City Center Opera. She continued to record and perform in opera until 1951, making her final appearance in the part of Belinda (to Kirsten Flagstad's Dido) in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas at the Mermaid Theatre in London.Warrack, John and West, Ewan (1992), The Oxford Dictionary of Opera, Her final concert appearance was at the Royal Festival Hall on 22 April 1956, aged 68. She spent her last years teaching. She died in London in 1976, aged 88. Personal life * She was the sister-in-law of the music-hall star Lottie Collins, who in 1902 married Teyte's brother James. * In 1909 she married her first husband, Eugene de Plumon, a French advocate. The marriage ended in divorce in 1915. Her second marriage, to Walter Sherwin Cottingham of the Berger Paint Company, also ended in divorce, in 1931. * During World War II, Teyte sang in a series of concerts sponsored by the French Committee of National Liberation for which she received the Gold Cross of Lorraine for services to France. * In 1958, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. * In 1958, her autobiography Star on the Door was published.

Wellhead with the armorial devices of Trivulzio and Sforza (Palazzo Trivulzio, Milan). Gian Giacomo Trivulzio (1440 or 1441 - December 5, 1518) was an Italian aristocrat and condottiero who held several military commands during the Italian Wars. Biography Trivulzio was born in Milan, where he studied, among the others, with Galeazzo Maria Sforza. In 1465, he followed the latter's army in France to help King Louis XI of France. He also took part in the Milanese campaigns against Bartolomeo Colleoni and fought alongside Federico III da Montefeltro in the wars in Romagna. In 1478 he supported the Florentines against Pope Sixtus IV's expansionism. Two years later he acquired the castle of Mesocco. In 1483, he abandoned Ludovico Sforza and switched his allegiance to Charles VIII of France. In 1484, he defeated the Venetians at Martinengo. In 1488, he married Beatrice d'Avalos, after his first wife (Margherita Colleoni) had died. In June of the same year, he moved to southern Italy, entering the service of the Kingdom of Naples and its ruler Ferdinand of Aragon. The same year, Isabella of Aragon, daughter of Prince Alfonso and granddaughter of King Ferdinand married Gian Galeazzo Sforza, formally Duke of Milan. In 1493, the young duke asked his father-in-law for support to regain his ducal power from his uncle, the Regent Ludovico il Moro. Ludovico then asked Charles VIII to invade Naples. Charles swept away any resistance in Italy and soon forced the Neapolitans to sign a treaty of peace. The treaty was negotiated by Trivulzio, who in the meantime had been named commander-in-chief of the Neapolitan army. Impressed by Trivulzio's capabilities, Charles decided to engage him, with Ferdinand's permission, for a salary of 10,000 ducats a year. Trivulzio marched toward France with Charles' army. When the retreating French were attacked by the League of Venice in the Battle of Fornovo (1495), he fought with the French army. On June 15, 1495, he was appointed governor of Asti and was given noble titles and territories in France. After Charles died in 1498, his successor Louis XII mustered a large army under Trivulzio to conquer the Duchy of Milan from Ludovico. Trivulzio took several fortified towns, and forced Ludovico to abandon Milan. On 6 October 1499, he presented Louis XII with the keys of the city. Louis made him governor of Milan; he had already made him a Marshal of France on September 29. Trivulzio also took part in the victorious Battle of Agnadello against the Republic of Venice, and commanded contingents of the French army at Novara and (this time allied with the Venetians against the Swiss) Marignano. In 1516 he successfully defended Milan from the assault of Emperor Maximilian I. However, reports about his behavior as governor caused him to fall in disgrace soon afterwards. He went to France to regain his position from King Francis I of France, but in vain. He died at Arpajon (France) in 1518. His nephew Teodoro Trivulzio was also a military commander under France, and was briefly governor of Milan, Genoa, and Lyon. Patronage of art Trivulzio accumulated huge amounts of money, which he used in part as a patron of arts, in particular of works by Bramantino: these include the Trivulzio Chapel in the Basilica of San Nazaro in Brolo, where he was buried, and the tapestries cycle of the Twelve Months now in the Castello Sforzesco in Milan. Leonardo da Vinci designed a large equestrian statue of Trivulzio, which was never begun.

Commonly known in Bermuda as the cahow, a name derived from its eerie cries, this nocturnal ground-nesting seabird is the national bird of Bermuda and can be found pictured on Bermudian currency. It is the second rarest seabird on the planet and a symbol of hope for nature conservation. They are known for their medium- sized body and long wings. The Bermuda petrel has a greyish-black crown and collar, dark grey upper-wings and tail, white upper-tail coverts and white under-wings edged with black, and the underparts are completely white. For 300 years, it was thought to be extinct. The dramatic rediscovery in 1951 of eighteen nesting pairs made this a \\"Lazarus species\\", that is, a species found to be alive after having been considered extinct. This has inspired a book and two documentary films. A national programme to preserve the bird and restore the species has helped increase its numbers, but scientists are still working to enlarge its nesting habitat on the restored Nonsuch Island. Diet and foraging Cahows typically eat small fish, squid and shrimp-like crustaceans. They also predominantly feed in colder waters. Geolocator studies carried out between 2009 and 2011 confirmed that they primarily forage in two widely separated locations during the non-breeding season (July to October), between Bermuda, Nova Scotia and North Carolina, and to the north and northwest of the Azores archipelago. Special glands in their tube-like nostrils allow them to ingest seawater. These glands filter out the salt and expel it through sneezing. Breeding Initially they were superabundant throughout the archipelago, but because of habitat degradation and invasion of mammals, the bird's suitable nesting areas have dwindled to four islets in Castle Harbor, Bermuda, in the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, some 650 miles east of North Carolina. The cahow is a slow breeder, but excellent flier. It visits land only to nest and spends most its adult life on the open seas ranging from the North Atlantic coastal United States and Canada to waters off western Europe. After 3‚Äì4 years at sea, males return to breeding islands to create nests. Breeding season takes place during January and June. They nest in burrows and only the ones that can be in complete darkness are chosen. Females return after 4‚Äì6 years at open sea looking for a mate; the females lay one egg per season. 40% to 50% fail to hatch. Eggs are incubated by both parents and take 53‚Äì55 days to hatch. Hatching occurs between May and June. Cahows mate for life and typically return to the same nest each year.  History  The Spanish sailors of the 1500s used Bermuda and its surrounding islands as a waypoint to the Americas. At that time, cahows were abundant and formed dense, noisy colonies. These sailors, as Diego Ramirez writes in 1603, would take up to 400 birds a night for food. In addition to eating birds, conquistadors brought hogs to the island to sustain themselves over their voyage. These hogs decimated the ground-nesting cahow, rooting up their burrows, eating eggs, chicks and adults and disrupting their breeding cycle. Following the Spanish arrival in Bermuda, the English ship Sea Venture was wrecked on the island in 1609. Those men that were shipwrecked culled the fattest individual petrels and harvested their eggs in abundance, especially in January when other food sources were diminished. This shipwreck led directly to the settlement of the island by the English in 1612. Bermuda's colonization by the English introduced species like rats, cats and dogs, and mass killings of the birds for food by these early colonists devastated their numbers. The remaining cahow population also decreased due to widespread burning of vegetation and deforestation by the settlers during the first 20 years of settlement. Despite being protected by one of the world's earliest conservation decrees, the governor's proclamation \\"against the spoyle and havocke of the Cohowes\\", the birds were thought to have become extinct by the 1620s. Subsequent sightings of the cahow were believed to be confusion with the similar Audubon's Shearwater. In 1935, William Beebe of the New York Zoological Society had hopes of rediscovering the bird. By June he was presented with an unidentified seabird that had struck the St. Davids Light house in Bermuda. The bird was then sent to American ornithologist Robert Cushman Murphy of The American Museum of Natural history in New York. He identified the bird as a Bermuda petrel. Six years later, Bermudian naturalist Louis L. Mowbray received a live Bermuda petrel that had collided with a radio antenna tower. The bird was released after rehabilitation two days later. After a bird that died flying into a lighthouse was identified as a cahow, in January 1951 18 surviving nesting pairs were found on rocky islets in Castle Harbour by Murphy and Mowbray and with them was a 15-year-old Bermudian boy, David B. Wingate, who would become the primary conservationist in the fight to save the bird.  Conservation  David B. Wingate devoted his life after that to saving the bird. After university studies and other work, in 1966 Wingate became Bermuda's first conservation officer. He undertook work to address various threats to the Bermuda petrel, including the eradication of introduced rats on the nesting islands and nearby islands, and addressed nest-site competition with the more aggressive, native white-tailed tropicbird Phaethon lepturus catsbyii, which invaded petrel nest burrows and killed up to 75% of all chicks. Following the design and installation of specially sized wooden \\"baffler\\" burrow entrance covers, which allowed the petrels to enter but excluded the larger tropicbirds, there has been essentially no further chick loss from this cause. Wingate also initiated the ecological restoration of Nonsuch Island, located near the Bermuda Petrel breeding islets. Nonsuch was a near desert after centuries of abuse, neglect and habitat destruction. The measures that had to be taken weren't just for conserving what was left but also to recreate what had been lost, and thousands of endemic and native plant, including Bermuda cedar (Juniperus bermudiana), Bermuda palmetto palm (Sabal bermudana) and Bermuda olivewood (Cassine laneanum), were propagated and planted out on Nonsuch to recreate the original forest ecosystem that once covered Bermuda, but which was almost entirely lost through disease and clearing for agriculture, shipbuilding and residential development. In total, almost 10,000 individual native and endemic plants of over 100 species were planted on Nonsuch starting in 1962, and have since developed into a well- established closed-canopy forest, similar to early accounts of what was found on Bermuda by the earliest settlers in the 1600s. Wingate's goal was to restore the habitat on Nonsuch Island so that it could eventually serve as a viable nesting site for the species. Even after retirement, Wingate designed and donated artificial plastic nest boxes to the Cahow Recovery Project, funded by the Bermuda Audubon Society. These nests were an effort made toward assisting the recovery of the Bermuda Petrel, which normally nest in deep soil burrows or rock crevices but suffered from a shortage of suitable nest sites and soil for the birds to burrow in on the original nesting islets. Artificial concrete burrows have been used for many years to provide additional nesting opportunities for the birds, but are very labor-intensive to construct, requiring 400-800 lbs of concrete each. The new nest boxes were designed to meet the birds nesting needs, and it is hoped that they will assist in the recovery of the Cahow for its future survival. David Wingate retired in 2000, after which Jeremy Madeiros became the Bermuda Government terrestrial conservation officer, taking over the management of the Cahow Recovery Program and the Nonsuch Island Living Museum Project. Madeiros carried out a review of the status of the Bermuda Petrel, identifying erosion of the four small original nesting islets due to hurricane damage and sea-level rise as the single largest threat facing the species. A banding program for both fledgling and adult Petrels was initiated in 2002, and by 2015 had resulted in over 85% of all Bermuda Petrels being fitted with identification bands, enabling positive identification of individual birds through their breeding lifespan. Madeiros published a recovery plan for the Bermuda Petrel, which provided guidelines and objectives for the management of the species, in 2005. =Translocation project= It was recognized that the four original tiny nesting islets, which were the only nesting locations for the Petrel and which totaled only 1 hectare (2.4 acres) in area, did not provide sufficient habitat for the species to fully recover. Madeiros, assisted by the Australian petrel specialist Nicholas Carlile, proposed and carried out a translocation project to re-establish a nesting population of Bermuda Petrel on Nonsuch Island, which at 6.9 ha (16.5 acres) was much larger and more elevated that the original nesting islets, offering safety from erosion and hurricane flooding and providing room for potentially thousands of nesting pairs. In 2004, the trial year of the project took place with 14 chicks translocated 18‚Äì21 days before fledging from the original nesting islets to a group of artificial concrete nest burrows constructed on Nonsuch, where they were fed fresh squid and anchovies and monitored every day until departure, with all fledging successfully. In 2005, 21 chicks were translocated, with all again fledging successfully by mid-June. This project was continued for a total of five years, with 105 chicks in total being translocated, of which 102 fledged successfully out to sea. =Breeding on Nonsuch Island= Bermuda petrel chick The first translocated Bermuda Petrels returned when mature to Nonsuch Island in February 2008. The first Petrel egg on Nonsuch Island in more than 300 years was laid in January 2009, and the resultant fledgling departed in June of the same year. A total of 49 of the original 102 translocated birds had been confirmed as returning to the nesting islands by 2015, of which 29 had returned to Nonsuch itself. This project has been successful in establishing a new nesting colony on Nonsuch, which by 2016 had grown to 15 nesting pairs. This colony had already produced 46 successfully fledged chicks between 2009 and 2016. Based on the success of the first translocation project, Madeiros started a second translocation project in 2013 at a different location on Nonsuch, to establish a second colony and foothold for the Bermuda Petrel on that island. During the first three years of this second project, a total of 49 near-fledged Cahow chicks had been translocated to the \\"B\\" colony site, with 45 successfully fledging out to sea. In 2016, the first of these birds, translocated as a chick in 2013, returned and paired up with a non- translocated bird in a burrow at the original translocation colony on Nonsuch. A Sound Attraction System was also set up in 2007 to help encourage returning translocated birds to stay and prospect on Nonsuch, and overcome any tendency for young birds to be attracted back to the activity at the original nesting islets. Thanks to the conservation efforts over the past five decades and extensive legal protection, the population of the Bermuda Petrel has risen from 17 to 18 breeding pairs producing 7-8 fledged chicks in 1960 to 132 breeding pairs producing 72 fledged chicks in 2019. The main threats for the future of the bird is still the lack of a suitable breeding sites, with 80% of the Bermuda Petrels nesting in artificial burrows, and ongoing erosion of the original smaller nesting islets due to hurricane impacts and sea-level rise. Category 3 Hurricane Fabian destroyed about 15 nesting burrows in 2003, and damage to most of the remainder required urgent repair and construction of replacement burrows. In 2010, Hurricane Igor caused further extensive damage to nest burrows on the original islets, and in 2014, Category 2 Hurricane Gonzalo, a late-season hurricane, killed 5 nesting pairs that had already returned on the smaller nesting islets. The global population of this bird in 2015 was about 300 individuals. A cahow was captured in a burrow and ringed on Vila islet, Azores, in November 2002. It was recaptured there in November 2003 and December 2006. Another individual was seen off the west coast of Ireland in May 2014, the furthest the species has ever been seen from Bermuda. = CahowCam Outreach Project = Starting in 2011 the \\"CahowCam\\" project was launched by the Bermuda-based LookBermuda / Nonsuch Expeditions Team in partnership with the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources. Since then it has been live streaming infrared video from specially adapted artificial nesting burrows from Nonsuch Island Translocation Colony A using specialized cameras and lights custom built by Team Leader Jean-Pierre Rouja. In 2016 they partnered with The Cornell Lab of Ornithology bird-cam team resulting in over 20 million minutes of CahowCam footage being watched in the following 3 seasons. http://www.nonsuchisland.com/live-cahow-cam = Habitat restoration = Cahows, being a recovering lazarus species, need special attention in order to support recovery and population growth. All nesting and nearby islands are strictly protected as part of the Castle Islands Nature Reserve, and landing by the public is prohibited except by special permission in the company of the conservation officer. This area is also designated as an international I.B.A. (Important Bird Area), in recognition of containing the entire world population of Bermuda Petrel, and up to 20% of the North Atlantic population of white-tailed tropicbird. These islands are maintained rat-free by an annual baiting program, and domestic animals are prohibited from landing on all islands in the reserve. In addition, there is an ongoing management program to eradicate non-native invasive plant species on all of the reserve islands, coupled with plantings of native and endemic plant species, many of which are also endangered. Several of the nesting islands are also the subject of an ecological restoration project, to restore them as examples of the terrestrial plant and animal communities once found on, but now largely lost from, the rest of Bermuda. = Other conservation issues = Though the Bermuda petrel's population has explicitly increased and it is projected that the population will double every 22 years, there are still clearcut inhibitors on its path to recovery. The petrel's vulnerability has drastically increased due to substantial damage to its habitats and nesting sites by tropical storms and climate change. The predicted future increase of category 4 and 5 tropical storms pose an imminent threat to the petrels' long-term survivability. Tropical storms also aid the long-term effect of erosion of their surrounding habitat which hamper conservation efforts. As a solution, there is research going into finding another suitable area to make the artificial nesting places. Its recovery has been hampered by competition from white-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon lepturus) for nest-sites and predation of subadults by a single snowy owl (the first ever recorded in Bermuda) on Nonsuch Island, which was eradicated after having eaten 5% of the population. Light pollution from a nearby airport and a NASA tracking station adversely affects nocturnal aerial courtship. Another major issue with nests is competition with other birds in the area. To address this problem, artificial dome nests were created for tropicbirds along areas, not used by the Bermuda petrel, and by applying wooden baffles over the entrances of petrel burrows. These baffles only allow petrels to enter, keeping the competition of tropicbirds out. Another factor may be that the cahow will have an increased risk of extinction because of restricted ranges, small population sizes, and lower genetic diversity. Additionally, the characteristic philopatry of petrel species may mean that birds continually return to the same high-mortality breeding sites year after year. Rats also swam to one breeding island in April 2005, but were successfully eradicated within two weeks without loss to the Cahows. Unfortunately this pattern appeared to be repeated in March 2008, with five chicks killed on one of the nesting islets. Immediate baiting produced a dead black rat, Rattus rattus. However, as the islands were all baited at the beginning of the nesting season, this incident pointed out the need for constant vigilance of reintroduction and a requirement to provide fresh bait on the islands throughout the nesting season. This was underlined by further invasions of some of the nesting islands, including Nonsuch Island, in 2014 and 2015, although this time without loss to the birds. References Notes * Beebe, W. 1932.

Since 2006 the development team consisted only of Donninger and Lutz. Hydra was under the patronage of the PAL Group and Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi. The goal of the Hydra Project was to dominate the computer chess world, and finally have an accepted victory over humans. Hydra represented a potentially significant leap in the strength of computer chess. Design team member Lorenz estimates its FIDE equivalent playing strength to be over Elo 3000, and this is in line with its results against Michael Adams and Shredder 8, the former micro-computer chess champion. Hydra began competing in 2002 and played its last game in June 2006. In June 2009, Christopher Lutz stated that \\"unfortunately the Hydra project is discontinued.\\" The sponsors decided to end the project. Architecture The Hydra team originally planned to have Hydra appear in four versions: Orthus, Chimera, Scylla and then the final Hydra version ‚Äì the strongest of them all. The original version of Hydra evolved from an earlier design called Brutus and works in a similar fashion to Deep Blue, utilising large numbers of purpose-designed chips (in this case implemented as a field-programmable gate array or FPGA). In Hydra, there are multiple computers, each with its own FPGA acting as a chess coprocessor. These co-processors enabled Hydra to search enormous numbers of positions per second, making each processor more than ten times faster than an unaided computer. Hydra ran on a 32-node Intel Xeon with a Xilinx FPGA accelerator card cluster, with a total of 64 gigabytes of RAM. It evaluates about 150,000,000 chess positions per second, roughly the same as the 1997 Deep Blue which defeated Garry Kasparov, but with several times more overall computing power. Whilst FPGAs generally have a lower performance level than ASIC chips, modern-day FPGAs run about as fast as the older ASICs used for Deep Blue. The engine is on average able to evaluate up to a depth of about 18 ply (nine moves by each player), whereas Deep Blue only evaluated to about 12 ply on average. Hydra's search used alpha-beta pruning as well as null-move heuristics.http://tournament.hydrachess.com/faq.php The Hydra computer was physically located in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, and was usually operated over a high speed optical fiber based network link. Tournaments and matches *In July 2002, Brutus finished third in the World Computer Chess Championship in Maastricht, the Netherlands. It won six games, drew two games, and lost one, giving it a score of 7 points out of 9. The loss, against Deep Junior, included a rook sacrifice for very long term compensation, which the additional computing power of Brutus could not help it to understand. *In November 2003, Brutus finished fourth in the World Computer Chess Championship in Graz, Austria. It won eight games, lost two games, and drew one, giving it a score of 8¬Ω out of 11. This disappointing result left the team to find a new sponsor, which they found in the form of the PAL group. *In February 2004, Hydra won the 13th IPCCC (International Paderborn Computer Chess Championship) tournament. Hydra scored 6¬Ω out of 7, ahead of Fritz and Shredder. *In April 2004, Hydra finished second in the International CSVN Tournament in Leiden, the Netherlands. It won five games, lost one game, and drew three, leaving it with 6¬Ω points out of 9, 1¬Ω points behind winner Shredder. A loss out of the opening led to the hiring of GM Christopher Lutz, who made a new opening book. *In August 2004, at the 14th Abu Dhabi International Chess Festival, Hydra played an eight-game match against the computer program Shredder 8, a multiple-time world computer chess champion. Running on \\"just\\" 16 nodes Hydra defeated Shredder 5¬Ω to 2¬Ω, winning three games and drawing the rest. In an informal match at the same tournament, Hydra took on International Grandmaster Evgeny Vladimirov of Kazakhstan, and defeated him by a score of 3¬Ω to ¬Ω. *In October 2004, in a man vs. machine contest, Hydra defeated former FIDE world champion Ruslan Ponomariov in both of their games. Ponomariov had an ELO rating of 2710 at the time of the match. *In February 2005, Hydra won the 14th IPCCC (International Paderborn Computer Chess Championships) tournament. Hydra scored 8 points out of 9 (seven wins and two draws), defeating chess program Shredder again in the process. *Due to human handler errors and program errors, Hydra did not fare well in the June 2005 PAL/CSS Freestyle Chess Tournament, an online tournament where players are allowed to access any and all resources to them, including computer engines, databases, as well as human grandmasters. Two versions of Hydra participated in the tournament- Hydra Chimera (without human intervention) scored 3¬Ω/8, and Hydra Scylla (with human intervention) scored 4/8. Neither version of Hydra qualified for the quarter- finals. *From June 21 to June 27, 2005, Hydra played a six-game match against Michael Adams, the top British player and ranked seventh in the world. The prize fund was $145,000, paid out on a per game basis: a win netting $25,000, a draw $10,000 to both players. Hydra defeated Adams by a score of 5¬Ω to ¬Ω; Adams lost each game except for game 2 which he drew. This version of Hydra was running on half power; only 32 out of 64 nodes were utilized. Adams played against the Scylla version of Hydra. *In November 2005, Hydra played 4 games: it beat Rustam Kasimdzhanov, drew with Alexander Khalifman, beat Ruslan Ponomariov and finally drew with Rustam Kasimdzhanov. *In the April 2006 PAL/CSS Freestyle Chess Tournament Hydra finished first with a score of 5¬Ω/7, a full point ahead of the field. This tournament allows for any human or computer aid including teams. All 64 of Hydra's nodes were utilized. *In the June 2006 PAL/CSS Freestyle Chess Main Tournament Hydra finished tied for fifth-sixteenth. Hydra was not defeated by an unaided human player in over- the-board play. Hydra has, however, been beaten by humans who had access to other programs during their games; for example, correspondence chess International Grandmaster Arno Nickel beat an older version of Hydra in a two- game correspondence match lasting six months. The 32-node version that played against Adams managed to draw Nickel in their third game, which lasted five months and ended in December 2005.

This book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by James Buechler in 1962 while he was eighteen or nineteen years old. Plot summary When dogs and men suddenly disappear, and strange screams fill the night, fantastic stories of vengeful ghosts are almost believable. It is these strange happenings which bring Frank and Joe Hardy to the Pocono Mountains to help their father's friend, a retired police captain, solve the mystery of Black Hollow. But when the Hardy Boys and Chet Morton arrive at Captain Thomas Maguire's cabin on the edge of the hollow, he has disappeared. In the woods the boys find only a few slim clues: a flashlight bearing the initials T.M., a few scraps of bright plaid cloth, and two empty shotgun shells which had been fired recently. Frank and Joe are determined to find the captain, despite Chet's misgivings after a night of weird and terrifying screams. Neighbors of the missing man insist that the bloodcurdling cries are those of a legendary witch who stalks Black Hollow seeking vengeance. Strangely, it is a small puppy that helps the boys disclose a most unusual and surprising set of circumstances, involving a mute boy, an elusive hermit, and a fearless puma trainer.

It is located in Vishwanath Galihttps://www.varanasiguru.com/vishwanath-gali/ of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. The Temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shiva Temples. The main deity is known by the names Shri Vishwanath and Vishweshwara (IAST: Vishveshvara) literally meaning Lord of the Universe. Varanasi city is also called Kashi in ancient time, and hence the Temple is popularly called as Kashi Vishwanath Temple. The etymology of the name Vishveshvara is Vishva: Universe, Ishvara: lord, one who has dominion. The Temple has been referred to in Hindu scriptures for a very long time as a central part of worship in the Shaiva Philosophy. It has been destroyed and re-constructed a number of times in history. The last structure was demolished by Aurangzeb, the sixth Mughal emperor who constructed the Gyanvapi Mosque on its site. The current structure was built on an adjacent site by the Maratha ruler, Ahilya Bai Holkar of Indore in 1780. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, First Sikh Maharaja, donated 1 ton Gold for flaming Temple's Dome. Since 1983, the temple has been managed by the government of Uttar Pradesh. During the religious occasion of Shivratri, Kashi Naresh (King of Kashi) is the chief officiating priest.  History  The temple is mentioned in the Puranas including the Kashi Khanda (section) of Skanda Purana. The original Vishwanath temple was destroyed by army of Ashish in 1194 CE, when he defeated the Raja of Kannauj as a commander of Mohammad Ghori. The temple was rebuilt by a Gujarati merchant during the reign of Delhi's Sultan Iltutmish (1211‚Äì1266 CE). It was demolished again during the rule of either Hussain Shah Sharqi (1447‚Äì1458) or Sikandar Lodhi (1489‚Äì1517). Raja Man Singh built the temple during Mughal emperor Akbar's rule, but some Hindus boycotted it as he had let the Mughals marry within his family. Raja Todar Mal further re-built the temple with Akbar's funding at its original site in 1585. In 1669 CE, Emperor Aurangzeb destroyed the temple and built the Gyanvapi Mosque in its place. The remains of the erstwhile temple can be seen in the foundation, the columns and at the rear part of the mosque. File:Temple Of Vishveshwur Benares by James Prinsep 1834.jpgGyanvapi Mosque, sketched as Temple of Vishveshvur in 1834 by James Prinsep File:Plan Of The Ancient Temple Of Vishveshvur by James Prinsep 1832.jpgPlan of the Ancient Temple of Vishveshvur, by James Prinsep Elevation of the present temple structure In 1742, the Maratha ruler Malhar Rao Holkar made a plan to demolish the mosque and reconstruct Vishweshwar temple at the site. However, his plan did not materialize, partially because of intervention by the Nawab of Awadh, who was given the control of the territory. Around 1750, the Maharaja of Jaipur commissioned a survey of the land around the site, with the objective of purchasing land to rebuild the Kashi Vishwanath temple. However, his plan to rebuild the temple did not materialize either. In 1780, Malhar Rao's daughter- in-law Ahilyabai Holkar constructed the present temple adjacent to the mosque. In 1828, Baiza Bai, widow of the Maratha ruler Daulat Rao Scindhia of Gwalior State, built a low-roofed colonnade with over 40 pillars in the Gyan Vapi precinct. During 1833‚Äì1840 CE, the boundary of Gyanvapi Well, the ghats and other nearby temples were constructed. A 7-foot high stone statue of Nandi bull, gifted by the Raja of Nepal lies to the east of the colonnade. Many noble families from various ancestral kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent and their prior establishments make generous contributions for the operations of the temple. In 1841, the Bhosales of Nagpur donated silver to the temple. In 1835, Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Sikh Empire, donated 1 tonne of gold for plating the temple's dome. The temple was managed by a hereditary group of pandas or mahants. After the death of Mahant Devi Dutt, a dispute arose among his successors. In 1900, his brother-in-law Pandit Visheshwar Dayal Tewari filed a lawsuit, which resulted in him being declared the head priest.  Legend  As per the Shiva Purana, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of Preservation) had an argument about who was supreme.R. 2003, pp. 92-95 To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. to determine who was mightier Vishnu took the form of Varaha and sought out the bottom while Brahma took the form of a swan to fly to the pillar's top. Brahma out of arrogance lied that he had found out the end, offering a katuki flower as witness. Vishnu modestly confessed to being unable to find the bottom. Shiva then took the form of the wrathful Bhairava, cut off Brahma's lying fifth head, and cursed Brahma that he would not be worshipped. Vishnu for his honesty would be worshiped as equal to Shiva with his own temples for all eternity. The jyotirlinga is an ancient axis mundi symbol representing the supreme formless (nirguna) reality at the core of creation, out of which the form (saguna) of Shiva appears. The jyothirlinga shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light.Eck 1999, p. 107See: Gwynne 2008, Section on Char Dham There are 64 forms of Shiva, not to be confused with Jyotirlingas. Each of the twelve jyotirlinga sites take the name of the presiding deity - each considered different manifestation of Shiva.Lochtefeld 2002, pp. 324-325 At all these sites, the primary image is lingam representing the beginningless and endless Stambha pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva.Harding 1998, pp. 158-158Vivekananda Vol. 4 The twelve jyothirlinga are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga, Deogarh in Deoghar, Jharkhand, Nageswar at Dwarka in Gujarat, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar at Aurangabad in Maharashtra.Chaturvedi 2006, pp. 58-72 The Manikarnika Ghat on the banks of Ganges near to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple is considered as a Shakti Peetha, a revered place of worship for the Shaktism sect. The Daksha Yaga, a Shaivite literature is considered as an important literature which is the story about the origin of Shakti Peethas.  Cultural Events Performed  Phalgun Shukla Ekadashi is celebrated as Rangabhari Ekadashi i.e. colors. According to tradition, before Holi, Baba Vishwanath comes back to Kashi after having a cow in the form of mother Bhagwati.The temple complex is echoed by the echo of dozens of Damroos. This tradition has been performed for over 200 years. On Basant Panchami Baba's Tilak is performed, Shivaratri marriage and Rangbhari Ekadashi marks parvati leaving with shiva.https://www.bhaskar.com/news/UP-VAR-rangbhari-ekadashi-celebrated-in- kashi-vishwanath-temple-varanasi-news-hindi-5546329-PHO.html These traditions are carried out by the erstwhile mahant family of the temple for over a century.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/kv-dham- project-13-building-owners-refuse-to-sell-property/articleshow/71469345.cms These rituals of Baba's marriage ceremony are performed at the residence of Dr. Kulpati Tiwari, the erstwhile Mahant of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Redzone.https://www.bbc.com/hindi/india-48308011 The seven rituals of Saptarishi Aarti were performed by Baba Vishwanath. According to the Puranas, Kashi is loved by the Saptarishi to the priest, so according to the tradition, the devotees of the Saptarishi Aarti perform the rituals of marriage. The seven archaks under the leadership of Pradhan Archak Pandit Shashibhushan Tripathi (Guddu Maharaj) completed the marriage in Vedic rituals.https://www.amarujala.com/uttar- pradesh/varanasi/111518554800-varanasi-news  Structure  The original holy well‚ÄîGyanvapi in between the temple and Gyanvapi Mosque The temple complex consists of a series of smaller shrines, located in a small lane called the Vishwanatha Galli, near the river. The linga of the main deity at the shrine is tall and in circumference housed in a silver altar. The main temple is quadrangle and is surrounded by shrines of other gods. There are small temples for Kaalbhairav, Dhandapani, Avimukteshwara, Vishnu, Vinayaka, Sanishwara, Virupaksha and Virupaksh Gauri in the complex. There is a small well in the temple called the Jnana Vapi also spelled as Gyaan vapi (the wisdom well). The Jnana Vapi well sites to the north of the main temple and during the invasion by the Mughals the Jyotirlinga was hidden in the well to protect it at the time of invasion. It is said that the main priest of the temple jumped in the well with the Shiv Ling in order to protect the Jyotirlinga from invaders. According to the structure of the temple, there is a Sabha Griha or Congregation Hall leading to the inner Garbha Griha or Sanctum Sanctorum. The venerable Jyotirlinga is a dark brown colored stone which is enshrined in the Sanctum, placed on a silver platform. Structure of the Mandir is composed of three parts. The first compromises a spire on the Mandir of Lord Vishwanath or Mahadeva. The second is gold dome and the third is the gold spire atop Lord Vishwanath carrying a flag and a trident. The Kashi Vishwanath temple receives around 3,000 visitors every day. On certain occasions, the numbers reach 1,000,000 and more. Noteworthy about the temple is 15.5-metre-high gold spire and gold dome. There are three domes each made up of pure gold, supplied by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1835.  Importance of the temple  Street near temple Located on the banks of the holy Ganges, Varanasi is regarded among the holiest of the Hindu cities. The Kashi Vishwanath temple is widely recognized as one of the most important places of worship in the Hindu religion. Inside the Kashi Vishwanath Temple is the Jyotirlinga of Shiva, Vishveshvara or Vishvanath. The Vishveshvara Jyotirlinga has a very special and unique significance in the spiritual history of India. Many leading saints, including Adi Sankaracharya, Ramakrishna Paramhansa, Swami Vivekananda, Bamakhyapa, Goswami Tulsidas, Swami Dayananda Saraswati, Sathya Sai Baba, Yogiji Maharaj, Pramukh Swami Maharaj, Mahant Swami Maharaj and Gurunanak have visited the site. A visit to the temple and a bath in the river Ganges is one of many methods believed to lead one on a path to Moksha (liberation). Thus, Hindus from all over the world try to visit the place at least once in their lifetime. There is also a tradition that one should give up at least one desire after a pilgrimage the temple, and the pilgrimage would also include a visit to the temple at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu in Southern India, where people take water samples of the Ganges to perform prayer at the temple and bring back sand from near that temple. Because of the immense popularity and holiness of Kashi Vishwanath temple, hundreds of temples across India have been built in the same architectural style. Many legends record that the true devotee achieves freedom from death and sa·πÉsƒÅra by the worship of Shiva, Shiva's devotees on death being directly taken to his abode on Mount Kailash by his messengers and not to Yama. The superiority of Shiva and his victory over his own nature‚ÄîShiva is himself identified with death‚Äîis also stated. There is a popular belief that Shiva himself blows the mantra of salvation into the ears of people who die naturally at the Kashi.Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna Vaippu Sthalam It is one of the shrines of the Vaippu Sthalams sung by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Sambandar. ‡Æ™‡ØÅ.‡ÆÆ‡Ææ.‡Æú‡ØÜ‡ÆØ‡Æö‡ØÜ‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ§‡Æ©‡Øç, ‡Æ§‡Øá‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ∞ ‡Æµ‡Øà‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æ≤‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç, ‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç, ‡Æö‡ØÜ‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©‡Øà, 2009 ‡ÆÆ‡ØÇ‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡Æ§‡Øá‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ∞ ‡Æµ‡Øà‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Øç ‡Æ§‡Æ≤‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç, Muvar Thevara Vaippu Thalangal, ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Æ£‡Ææ‡Æö‡Æø - (‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æö‡Æø ‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æ∏‡Øç‡Æµ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ§‡Æ∞‡Øç ‡ÆÜ‡Æ≤‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç) Varanasi -Benaras - Kasi Vishvanathar Temple, 2-39-7 ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Æ£‡Ææ‡Æö‡Æø, 2-39-7, 6-70-6, 6-7-11  See also  *Shri Vishwanath Mandir *Mrityunjay Mahadev Mandir *Ratneshwar Mahadev temple *Hindu temples in Varanasi  References   Notes  .  *  External links  * *Kashi Vishwanath Temple Website *Shri Kashi Vishwanath Mandir, Varanasi *Shri Vishwanath Gali, Varanasi Category:Jyotirlingas Category:Hindu temples in Varanasi Category:Religious buildings and structures converted into mosques Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1780 Category:Shiva temples in Varanasi ","title":"Kashi Vishwanath Temple"},{"id":"2074091","text":"Mantova 1911 Societ√† Sportiva Dilettantistica a Responsabilit√† Limitata (Mantova 1911 S.S.D. a r.l.), commonly referred to as Mantova, is an Italian football club based in Mantua (), Lombardy. Mantova had played consecutively in the Italian Serie B from the 2005‚Äì06 season to 2009‚Äì10 as Associazione Calcio Mantova (A.C.

During the summer 2010, the club went bankrupt and was refounded as Mantova F.C., being immediately promoted in the following season from Serie D group B to Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. The club went bankrupt again in 2017 and has since played three consecutive seasons in Serie D. Colours and badge = Colours = Mantova played in a sky blue shirt with white shorts and sky blue socks until 1956, when OZO company became the club's main sponsor. Colours were changed from sky blue and white to white and red, the colours of the company, in an unusual scheme for Italian football: white with a red sash. Mantova debuted in Serie A with this kit. In the late 1960s, when the club had poor results, a red shirt with white shorts and red socks was adopted as the home kit. The OZO Mantova kit was reintroduced by the owner Fabrizio Lori in the 2000s, and since then became the home kit. In the last years the away kit has usually retained the home kit scheme, inverting the colours: a white sash on a red base. Sky blue has been used mainly for third kits. During the 2010-11 campaign, a special sky blue shirt with a white and red sash was released to celebrate the club's 100th anniversary and was used as the first choice kit for the final part of the season. During the Serie B years between 2005 and 2008 Mantova used a yellow kit with a green sash to remember the \\"Piccolo Brasile\\", the team who achieved three promotions in four years between the end of the 1950s and the start of the 1960s. = Badge = Mantova crest has always been characterized by two elements: the town's coat of arms and a light blue semicircle to remember the original colours of the team, combined in a round shape. The round element has been inserted in a red and white shield, with an upper white stripe in which the name of the club is written. History Mantova was founded in 1911. They played in Serie A for seven seasons: 1961‚Äì62, 1964‚Äì65, 1966‚Äì67, 1967‚Äì68, 1971‚Äì72), being nicknamed in its initial period as \\"Little Brazil\\" (\\"Piccolo Brasile\\"). The green and yellow shirt actually remembered that period, by far the best one in the team history. Mantova has also played eight seasons in Serie B, winning the title 1970‚Äì71. Mantova was cancelled two times from the Italian football panorama, in 1983 and 1994, both times due to insolvency. Former famous players for the club include Dino Zoff, Angelo Sormani, Anton Alleman and Karl-Heinz Schnellinger. Mantova was promoted from Serie C2 to Serie B in two consecutive seasons, in 2003‚Äì04 as league champions, and in 2004‚Äì05 as runners-up and playoff winners. Mantova begun the 2005‚Äì06 Serie B campaign introducing itself as a strong potential candidate for promotion to Serie A, despite its lack of players experienced with these levels (almost the same squad which promoted to Serie B the previous season) and a coach, Domenico Di Carlo, on just his second year as first team football trainer. The team led the Serie B table for a long part of the season, gaining an unexpected interest by the media. However, Mantova was not able to maintain the head of the league in the end, and the team concluded its season in fourth place, gaining a spot in the promotion playoffs. Successively, AC Mantova won its playoff semifinal against Modena after two ties (0‚Äì0, 1‚Äì1), qualifying because of its top placement in the regular season. The first playoff final, against Torino, saw Mantova winning at home 4‚Äì2. However, Mantova was not able to maintain this advantage in the return match, lost 3‚Äì1 in Turin after extra time, which allowed Torino to be promoted in Serie A because of a superior placement in the regular season. During the 2006‚Äì07 season, Mantova became the first club to beat Juventus in a Serie B match. They ended the season in eighth place, confirming themselves in the top side of the league table. Following Di Carlo's resignations, Mantova appointed Attilio Tesser as new head coach for their 2007‚Äì08 Serie B campaign. As part of an ambitious summer transfer market, on 23 August 2007 Mantova signed former Italian international Stefano Fiore. However, the club's campaign proved to be disappointing as the team failed to break into the promotion playoff zone, resulting in the sacking of Tesser in the mid-season. He was replaced by Giuseppe Brucato, a young manager with no previous experience in the league, who guided the club to a mid-table finish in the season. Brucato was confirmed as head coach of Mantova for the 2008‚Äì09 season. As Fiore parted company with the club following an unimpressive season with the virgiliani, he was replaced by Tomas Locatelli. However, Mantova failed to assure themselves a place in the higher ranks of the league, causing the sacking of Brucato following a 1‚Äì3 home defeat to Parma. The club successively appointed former Milan defender Alessandro Costacurta as its new head coach. Costacurta later resigned and was replaced by Mario Somma, who led the club to a final 13th place, only two points ahead the relegation play-off zone. For the 2009‚Äì10 season, Mantova was guided by former Italian international Michele Serena. The financial situation of the club was deteriorated, which the club raised the short term profit by player exchange, but also raised the long term amortisation cost. The club had swapped Stefano Mondini with Christian Jidayi on 30 June 2008 in co-ownership deal for ‚Ç¨750,000, made the clubs had player selling revenue of ‚Ç¨1.5 million. June 2009 also saw Jidayi return to Cesena and Mondini back to Mantova; 50% of both players' rights were valued at ‚Ç¨750,000.AC Cesena SpA Report and Accounts on 30 June 2009 However, it became a financial burden for both clubs, which Mantova had to amortise Mondini's value (‚Ç¨1.5 million) in instalments as amortisation. In June 2008 Mantova also swapped Valerio Di Cesare (‚Ç¨1M) and Simone Calori (‚Ç¨0.5M) with Riccardo Fissore (‚Ç¨0.5M) and Mattia Marchesetti (‚Ç¨1M).Vicenza Calcio SpA Report and Accounts on 30 June 2008 Again, Mantova had to amortise ‚Ç¨0.5M in for 3 seasons for Fissore (‚Ç¨166,667) and Marchesetti (‚Ç¨333,333). At the beginning of 2010‚Äì11 season, Mantova went bankrupt and a new entity was admitted to Serie D. Mantova came first in Girone B and gained promotion to 2011‚Äì12 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. They finished 16th and only escaped relegation after beating both Lecco and Vibonese in the playoffs. The first leg against Vibonese was a 0‚Äì0 stalemate away, leading to fears the club would not survive the second leg. However, Mantova went on to record a famous 4‚Äì0 victory. The home leg was viewed by over 3,000 spectators and Mantova enjoyed some of the strongest support of the 40 sides in Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. Throughout the 2011‚Äì12 season, Mantova sacked three managers and three sporting directors. In the 2012‚Äì13 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, Mantova had a solid season, finishing in ninth place, nine points short of a promotion playoff place and 11 points above a relegation playoff place. In the off season, 70% of Mantova is sold to former Sambonifacese president Michele Lodi, who became the president of Mantova. The Lega Pro Seconda Divisione underwent a reformatting. The first eight teams in each girone, plus one team winning the relegation playoff round from each division will remain in Lega Pro. The last six teams in each girone, plus three relegation play-out losers from each division will be relegated to Serie D. In all, eighteen teams will remain in Lega Pro, and eighteen teams will be relegated to Serie D. In the 2013‚Äì14 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione, Mantova finished eighth, which guaranteed them a spot in next season's 2014‚Äì15 Lega Pro Divisione Unica, the new Serie C. The team was part of the \\"Group A\\". Mantova remained in the third tier until 2017. At the start of season, the club did not join the 2017‚Äì18 Serie C, a successor club, Mantova 1911 S.S.D.,http://seried.lnd.it/download/serieD/comunicati/2017-18/cu_014.pdf was admitted to 2017‚Äì18 Serie D instead.. In 2018 it was taken over by Maurizio Setti, the holder of Hellas Verona, who invested in the club to be promoted to Serie C. Mantova lost the championship to Como despite reaching 83 points, and it is now at its third consecutive season in Serie D.

While most of the inhabitants live in the city center, the others live in the four urban coastal wards, extending from Su·ªëi N∆∞·ªõc beach in the northeast towards cape K√™ G√† in the southwest. Traditionally, fishing and manufacturing of fish sauce has been the main source of Phan Thi·∫øt's income thus far, the picturesque fishing fleet in the harbor providing colorful proof. Drawn by the beautiful beaches of the area, tourism is rapidly replacing the fishing industry as the main employer. The first resorts along the beaches of H∆∞ng Long and Ph√∫ Th·ªßy wards, as well as Ph√∫ H√†i and H√†m Ti·∫øn wards east of the city center appeared in the mid-nineties. Since then, tourism has boomed and hundreds of hotels, restaurants, resorts, guesthouses and shops have been constructed along the coastline. Rang Beach in H√†m Ti·∫øn ward was discovered by foreigners in 1995 while they watched the solar eclipse. Misled by guidebooks, which incorrectly labelled Rang Beach as \\"M≈©i N√© Beach\\", they were the first of a long row of tourists mistakenly calling everything east of the Phan Thi·∫øt city center \\"M≈©i N√©.\\"City Pass Guide: Phan Thiet Each area of Phan Thi·∫øt has its own characteristics. The beaches of K√™ G√† and Ti·∫øn Th√†nh are peaceful and quiet, inviting tourists to swim and relax. There is not much traffic on the roads along the coastline, so walking or riding along the beach is quite peaceful. Compared to Nha Trang, the density of resorts along the beaches of the city center in Phan Thi·∫øt is quite low, so when tourists leave their hotels, they step into the middle of the bustling daily life of a Vietnamese city. You can walk to many restaurants, museums or shopping malls ‚Äì even visit the school where H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh taught before he went to study in Paris. Ph√∫ H√†i ward covers a hilly area along the coastline and has many small beaches and hidden coves. Many of the resorts in this ward are built above the water on the hills and have a relatively small beach to themselves. Sea Links City, composed of a hotel, condos, apartments, a winery and a golf course, is located here. Ba Nai Hill in Ph√∫ H√†i ward is the place of the old Po Sah In∆∞ Cham Tower, built in the 8th century and worth a visit. Alongside the 10 kilometer strip of what is locally known as Rang Beach, in H√†m Ti·∫øn ward, there is a lively tourist strip. Hundreds of resorts, hotels, bars, restaurants, shops, travel agencies and spas are situated here. In recent years advanced beach erosion has become a major issue for Phan Thi·∫øt's beaches, especially in Ph√∫ H√†i and H√†m Ti·∫øn wards, so some resorts lack a beach at high tide: the water directly reaches the sea wall. In recent years a number of resorts had to install geotechnical tubes (Geotubes) to keep their beaches from further eroding. One of the great tourist attractions of H√†m Ti·∫øn is the so-called Fairy Stream, where a small creek has carved a canyon through the dunes, revealing colorful layers of sand and limestone. Beyond H√†m Ti·∫øn is M≈©i N√©, consisting of two communities, adding up to around 25,000 residents in the actual town, and two beaches. The second community is Hon Rom, a fishing village with a few hundred residents. M≈©i N√© has the highest population outside the city center and is quite lively in the morning. In the evening locals join together for coffee or dinner at the many caf√©s and restaurants, especially around the local market. M≈©i N√© actually translates to \\"Shelter Cape,\\" because for ages the local fishermen used the cape to shelter their boats from the wind. The town itself covers the west side of the cape, whereas many resorts are alongside Ganh Beach and Su·ªëi N∆∞·ªõc. A resort in M≈©i N√© ward is the right decision for people who want to be close to a local community, but keep their distance from the bustling tourist strip and rather prefer a quiet beach. Another tourist attraction are the orange sand dunes, located on a hill between M≈©i N√© and Hon Rom. At the entrance of Hon Rom you can explore the \\"Red Canyon\\", a small cliff which has eroded to create a beautiful ridge, consisting of fragile red sand. The larger white sand dunes (B√†u Tr·∫Øng) are around 23 kilometers north of the town. Phan Thi·∫øt operators usually make a distinction between the winter and summer seasons. During winter, mostly Northern Europeans and Russians spend their holidays here, far away from the northern chill, to enjoy kitesurfing and windsurfing. In the summer season, Phan Thi·∫øt is a popular destination for Australians and North Americans, as well as many Vietnamese escaping the steaming hot cities for a fresh breeze of sea wind. Name There are several theories about the origin of the name Phan Thi·∫øt, most of which agree that it is not a pure Vietnamese name: * Before the Vietnamese conquest of the area in the 17th century, the Cham people called this land \\"Hamu Lithit\\" ‚Äì with \\"Hamu\\" meaning hamlet in the field, and \\"Lithit\\" meaning near the sea. With the arrival of Vietnamese settlers, a new name in Vietnamese was gradually developed. Since the Vietnamese had already changed the Cham city of Panduraga into Phan Rang and another settlement into Phan R√≠, they attached the prefix \\"Phan\\" into the shortening of \\"Lithit\\" to make the name Phan Thi·∫øt. * Vietnamese people have been transliterating the Cham names into more Vietnamese sounding names: Panduranga or Mang-lang into Phan Rang, Mang-l√Ω into Phan R√≠, Hamu Lithit or Mang-thit into Phan Thi·∫øt. Those three places are referred to as \\"Tam Phan\\" (Triple Phan). * The name of the Cham Prince who was the military governor of the area in the 15th century was Po Thit (brother of the princess Po Sah In∆∞ and son of King Par Ra ChƒÉm Chanh or Tr√† Chanh). The fortification was thus called Camp Po Thit. The Vietnamese pronounced the camp name as \\"Phan Thi·∫øt.\\" History * This area used to belong to the ancient kingdom of Champa and was later absorbed into the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát Empire (former name of Vietnam). Vietnamese rule was established over the area which has become the present-day province of B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n, although back then the administrative level and the boundaries of the area hadn't been determined. * In 1697, B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n in turn was changed from a fort (\\"tr·∫•n\\") to a district (ph·ªß), then to a dinh. Later, Phan Thi·∫øt was officially recognized as a ƒë·∫°o (along with Phan Rang, Ph·ªë H√†i and Ma Ly of the Tam T√¢n area). * From 1773 to 1801, there was fierce fighting between the forces of the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty and T√¢y S∆°n dynasty in the area. * In 1825, during the reign of Emperor Minh M·∫°ng, B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n officially became a province; part of Phan Thi·∫øt was made into the district of H√†m Thu·∫≠n. In 1854, during T·ª± ƒê·ª©c's reign, the district was renamed Tuy L√Ω. * In 1836 (the 17th year of Minh M·∫°ng's reign), a cabinet officer named ƒê√†o Tri Ph·ªß was sent to B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n to oversee the surveying tasks and establish land boundaries for 307 communes and villages in fifteen districts of B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n in order to determine taxation. On the right bank of the river (C√† Ty river today) were ƒê·ª©c Th·∫Øng, Nhu·∫≠n ƒê·ª©c and L·∫°c ƒê·∫°o village. On the left bank were Long B√¨nh and Minh Long. * Even near the end of the 19th century, Phan Thi·∫øt was not yet officially recognized as an administrative unit (lower level) within B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n province. * In 1898 (the 10th year of the reign of Emperor Th√†nh Th√°i), B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n's provincial capital was moved to Ph√∫ T√†i village, a suburb of Phan Thi·∫øt. On 20 October of that year, Th√†nh Th√°i signed a decree to make Phan Thi·∫øt a city and provincial capital (on the same day as the establishment of the cities of B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n, Hu·∫ø, H·ªôi An, Qui Nh∆°n, Thanh H√≥a and Vinh). * In the 20th century, it was a center of the VNQDƒê independence movement.Van Dao Hoang Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc D√¢n ƒê·∫£ng: A Contemporary History of a National ... 2008 Page 158 \\"Ph·∫°m Ho√†i Xu√¢n's ancestors originated from Phan Thi·∫øt.

Color Map of the Wards of Phan Thi·∫øt Located on an arm of the East Vietnam Sea, Phan Thi·∫øt is one of Vietnam's most important fishing areas. Its population is roughly 205,333 (as of 2004). H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh reportedly lived in Phan Thi·∫øt for a short time around 1910 and worked as a schoolteacher. During the Vietnam War, Phan Thi·∫øt was the site of the U.S. military base known as Landing Zone Betty, which was located at the now closed airfield southwest of the city. In recent years, Phan Thi·∫øt (specifically M≈©i N√© Beach) has been transformed into a resort destination. 24 October 1995 is considered to be the birth of tourism in Phan Thi·∫øt, when thousands rushed to M≈©i N√© to see the total solar eclipse. The event was commemorated on the same day in 2005 as the tenth anniversary of tourism for the province. Local people in Phan Thi·∫øt regularly practice a ceremony to a whale god, which is believed to give good luck in nautical pursuits.The whale god of Phan Thi·∫øt thumb Photos of Phan Thi·∫øt File:Phan Thiet Bridge.JPGBridge in Phan Thi·∫øt File:Phan Thiet Hotel.JPGHotel in Phan Thi·∫øt File:Phan Thiet Statue.JPGStatue in Phan Thi·∫øt File:Street of Phan Thiet.JPGStreet in Phan Thi·∫øt File:Phan Thi·∫øt - street.JPGStreet in Phan Thi·∫øt File:Phan Thi·∫øt - beach.JPGBeach in Phan Thi·∫øt File:B·ªô c·ªët c√° voi.jpgV·∫°n Th·ªßy T√∫ temple, one of the Vietnamese Whale worship sites, hosts the largest whale skeleton in Vietnam.

Only the shtriga herself could cure those she had drained. The shtriga is often pictured as a woman with a hateful stare (sometimes wearing a cape) and a horribly disfigured face. They usually live in hidden places in the forest and have supernatural powers. The term shtriga is used also with the common meaning of \\"witch\\", referring to a bad and ugly old woman who casts evil spells to people. The male noun for shtriga is shtrigu or shtrigan. Etymology The Albanian word shtrig√´, definite: shtriga derives from the Latin strƒ´ga, \\"evil spirit, witch\\", related to , and . Legend According to legend, only the shtriga herself could cure those she had drained (often by spitting in their mouths), and those who were not cured inevitably sickened and died. The name can be used to express that a person is evil. According to Northern Albanian folklore, a woman is not born a witch; she becomes one, often because she is childless or made evil by envy. A strong belief in God could make people immune to a witch as He would protect them. Usually, shtriga were described as old or middle-aged women with grey, pale green, or pale blue eyes (called white eyes or pale eyes) (sybardha) and a crooked nose. Their stare would make people uncomfortable, and people were supposed to avoid looking them directly in the eyes because they have the evil eye (syliga). To ward off a witch, people could take a pinch of salt in their fingers and touch their (closed) eyes, mouth, heart and the opposite part of the heart and the pit of the stomach and then throw the salt in direct flames saying \\"syt i dal√ßin syt i pla√ßin\\" or just whisper 3-6 times \\"syt i dal√ßin syt i pla√ßin\\" or \\"plast syri keq.\\" In some regions of Albania, people have used garlic (hudh√´r); to send away the evil eye or they have placed a puppet in a house being built to catch the evil. Newborns, children or beautiful girls have been said to catch the evil eye more easily, so in some Albanian regions when meeting such a person, especially a newborn, for the first time, people might say \\"masha'alla'h\\" and touch the child's nose to show their benevolence and so that the evil eye would not catch the child. Edith Durham recorded several methods traditionally considered effective for defending oneself from shtriga. A cross made of pig bone could be placed at the entrance of a church on Easter Sunday, rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave. They could then be captured and killed at the threshold as they vainly attempted to pass. She further recorded the story that after draining blood from a victim, the shtriga would generally go off into the woods and regurgitate it. If a silver coin were to be soaked in that blood and wrapped in cloth, it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga.Durham, Edith: High Albania (London, Phoenix Press, 2000), pp. 87-88. In Catholic legend, it is said that shtriga can be destroyed using holy water with a cross in it,Old believes in Albania and in Islamic myth it is said that shtriga can be sent away or killed by reciting verses from the Qur'an, specifically Ayatul Kursi 225 sura Al-Baqara, and spitting water on the shtriga.The Noble Qur'an last sura and the Throne Verse, or Ayatul Kursi, is 255th verse (ayah) of the second chapter (sura) Al-Baqara In popular culture A shtriga was featured in the Supernatural episode, \\"Something Wicked\\" by hiding itself as a male doctor in a children's ward at a hospital where children have suddenly fallen comatose and where it can continue to feed. A shtriga was featured in the Lost Girl episode \\"Follow the Yellow Trick Road.\\" Bo's friends search for the creature after figuring out that the shtriga had bitten Bo in its moth form, leaving her comatose and dying as it feeds on her fears. Geralt of Rivia fought a shtriga in the novel The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski, part of The Witcher series. The scene also takes place in the 2007 video game The Witcher. In the 2019 Netflix series The Witcher, a shtriga is featured in episode 3. The Shtriga appears in the Legends of Tomorrow episode \\"Wet Hot American Bummer.\\" This version attacks the children at a summer camp and poses as a camp counselor.

Mulvey was also responsible for editing other Stratemeyer Syndicate stories with aviation content. Plot summary Joe and Frank Hardy go to a magic show with their dad. After the show is done, their dad asks Hexton how the vanishing act was performed. Hexton offers to do the trick on Fenton Hardy. When their dad disappears, he does not reappear. Hexton says their dad is simply playing a joke on them; Joe and Frank do not believe this. They suspect he was kidnapped. To be sure, Joe and Frank study some of their dad's records; they find Hexton was the leader of an international gang. The first place they look is in a lighthouse that they suspected he might be in. They go inside and see a guard; the guard tries to escape but cannot. He says their dad was here but is not anymore. Though not sure, the boys suspect that their dad was purposely moved to a more secretive place. The boys check in Hexton's castle but get caught. They find that the hinges of the place they were locked in were bad; Joe and Frank take turns to pry them off. Finally, the boys escape. The boys overhear the gang talking about stealing some jewels. They now have a second job to do. As the boys were leaving, the criminals try to recapture them. It ends up that the police have come just in time to save the boys. Although the boys are fine, the criminals escape. Hexton steals the jewels and takes a ride on Flight 101. Joe and Frank also take a ride on Flight 101, but see nothing suspicious. When everyone was exiting the plane, the boys think they see Hexton. As they try to capture him, another person helps in the capturing of Hexton. It ends up that the person was Fenton Hardy. All along Joe and Frank's dad was spying on Flight 101.

In the context of leftist organizations in Iran, the Communist Party of Iran is considered to an armed, dominantly Kurdish organization. The group supports decentralization within their organization including their armed operations. They advocate for coordinating bodies of structure and general autonomy regarding their structure. The Communist Party of Iran is active throughout industrialized areas of Iran. History The Communist Party of Iran was founded in 1983, Iranian Kurdistan. The Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Kurdish organization Komala, merged with three related Iranian-leftist organizations including Sahand, a leftist group which later founded Union of Communist Militants, a faction of Peykar. Prior to merging, Komalah was considered to be a strictly Maoist party. The Communist Party of Iran today voices their disapproval of Mao as a revolutionary, claiming he committed many mistakes throughout the 1950s to the 1970s. The party denounces the Islamic Republic and does not view it as a revolutionary regime. The CPI also rejects the Tudeh's practices from the late 1950s and onward, citing a particular grievance with Tudeh giving support to the Shahs of Iran and Ayatollah Khomeini's regime. The organisation currently advocates freedom, political and social rights in Iran and Iranian Kurdistan. They also advocate women's rights, labor laws and workers' rights. The party has representations in Germany (K√∂ln and Frankfurt), Finland, Sweden (G√∂teborg and Stockholm), Norway, Denmark (Copenhagen), the UK (London), Australia and Canada (Toronto).

He has a cult reputation largely due to his debut film Performance, which he wrote the screenplay for and co-directed with Nicolas Roeg. Biography = Early years = Donald Cammell was born in the Camera Obscura (then known as the Outlook Tower) on Castlehill, near the castle in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was the elder son of the poet and writer Charles Richard Cammell (who wrote a book on occultist Aleister Crowley) and Iona Macdonald. His middle name Seton came from his godfather, the Scottish naturalist Seton Gordon. He was educated at Shrewsbury House School and Westminster School. Brought up in a bohemian atmosphere, Donald Cammell was raised in an environment he described as \\"filled with magicians, metaphysicians, spiritualists and demons\\" including Aleister Crowley. = Painting career = Cammell was a precociously gifted painter, winning a scholarship to the Royal Academy at the age of 16. He subsequently studied in Florence with Annigoni and made his living as a society portrait painter. In 1953, one of his portraits was hailed as \\"society portrait of the year\\". After the end of a short-lived early marriage, he moved to New York to live with model Deborah Dixon and concentrate on painting nudes. = Cinema career = In 1961, he moved to Paris and began writing screenplays; first, a thriller called The Touchables, then a collaboration with Harry Joe Brown Jnr called Duffy. This caper movie was directed by Robert Parrish in 1968 (and featured James Fox), an artistic failure that frustrated Cammell to the point that he decided to direct. Through his friendship with Anita Pallenberg, he came into the orbit of the Rolling Stones and moved to London. After Performance, he wrote a script called Ishtar that was to feature William Burroughs as a judge kidnapped while on holiday in Morocco. Like most of the scripts he worked on, it remained unproduced. His unwillingness to compromise his ideas alienated him from the Hollywood establishment that perceived him as an eccentric troublemaker. Several of Cammell's major frustrations involved Marlon Brando. In 1978, Brando invited Cammell to collaborate on a script called Fan Tan which Brando soon lost interest in; then he asked Cammell to adapt the script as a novel and again scuttled the project halfway through by losing interest. In 1987, Brando employed Cammell to direct a script he had written called Jericho. After eighteen months of work, while on pre-production in Mexico, Brando again decided he did not want to go through with the project. The next project Cammell managed to get made was a short called The Argument (1971/99) that was shot on location in the Utah desert by Vilmos Zsigmond on the sly. Cammell had obtained the camera on the grounds that Zsigmond was shooting tests for another film. This confrontation between a frustrated film director and a goddess (played by Myriam Gibril, Cammell's lover and Isis to his Osiris in Lucifer Rising) covers many of Cammell‚Äôs favourite themes, but Cammell never completed the film. It was rediscovered and put together by his editor, Frank Mazzola, in 1999. Cammell‚Äôs next feature was Demon Seed (1977). Although not a personal project, this science fiction thriller (based on a book by Dean R. Koontz) featured many of Cammell‚Äôs obsessions. A super-computer takes over a scientist‚Äôs house with his wife (Julie Christie) inside and proceeds to terrorise and ultimately impregnate her. A two-hander between Christie and the computer, Demon Seed's mind games and closed environment are reminiscent of Performance, while the idea of the machine giving a child to the heroine and thus providing itself with a human incarnation is another example of Cammell‚Äôs fascination with transformative sexuality. Cammell had to wait until 1987 to complete another project, White of the Eye. This study of a serial killer features a return of his cross-cutting techniques (absent from Demon Seed). Personal life Cammell was married twice, first to the Greek actress Maria Andipa (m. 1954), by whom he had a son Amadis (b. 1959), and then to the American writer China Kong (m. 1978). He is survived by his son and his second wife. Death Cammell committed suicide by shotgun in 1996.

This book was written for the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Andrew E. Svenson in 1969. Plot summary The Hardy Boys and Chet Morton fly to Iceland to look for Rex Hallbjornsson, a sailor owed a payout from an insurance company. Before they leave Bayport, someone attempts to kidnap Frank. An American astronaut has disappeared in Iceland while studying the volcanoes. Frank finds a glove which may have been dropped by the astronaut next to a sulfur pit. The Hardys take a flight on a private plane to Akureyri. The pilot is a phony and forces a landing on a glacier, where the Hardys are fooled by a phony rescue helicopter that picks up the phony pilot and leaves them behind. They try to use the radio, but the phony pilot has hidden the frequency crystal. They find it and make contact with the radio tower at Reykjavik. Another helicopter comes to pick up the Hardys. They go to Akureyri and visit a phony Rex Hallbjornsson. Returning to Reykjavik, they see Chet wandering in front of the hotel with a strange expression. They realize he has been drugged. Thinking someone might be in their room examining their belongings, they rush upstairs and find the phony pilot and his phony rescuer. Joe tries to grab the pilot, whose wig comes off. It is the phony Rex Hallbjornsson, who gets away with his partner. Chet and Biff Hooper, who has joined the others in Iceland, go to investigate a man named Hallbjornsson who might know Rex, while Frank and Joe go with a coast guard officer to look for Hallbjornsson at sea. After a devastating storm Frank sees a small raft, possibly with a motor, and thinks it might be the criminals. Over the course of a day or two, they put on disguises and act as phony crewmen for Rex Mar (the real Hallbjornsson, who has changed his name). Musselman, the phony Rex Hallbjornsson, is fooled by their disguises until Joe slips up by speaking English rather than Icelandic. The boys defeat the criminals in hand-to-hand combat and have them arrested. With the help of Biff who was kidnapped, the boys figure out how the remaining bad guys are going to transport the kidnapped astronaut. The kidnappers take over a plane and resist efforts to stop them but the astronaut and Chet, who was also kidnapped, break free and subdue them.

When the voltage in a circuit or part of it is raised above its upper design limit, this is known as overvoltage. The conditions may be hazardous. Depending on its duration, the overvoltage event can be transient‚Äîa voltage spike‚Äîor permanent, leading to a power surge.  Explanation  Lack of 3-phase electric system connected by star. If zero breaks off, small-power appliances will be destroyed by overvoltage Electronic and electrical devices are designed to operate at a certain maximum supply voltage, and considerable damage can be caused by voltage that is higher than that for which the devices are rated. For example, an electric light bulb has a wire in it that at the given rated voltage will carry a current just large enough for the wire to get very hot (giving off light and heat), but not hot enough for it to melt. The amount of current in a circuit depends on the voltage supplied: if the voltage is too high, then the wire may melt and the light bulb would have \\"burned out real time\\". Similarly other electrical devices may stop working, or may even burst into flames if an overvoltage is delivered to the circuit.  Sources  = Natural = A typical natural source of transient overvoltage events is lightning. Bursts of solar wind following solar flares are also known to cause overvoltage in electrical circuits, especially onboard space satellites. = Man-made = Man-made sources of spikes are usually caused by electromagnetic induction when switching on or off inductive loads (such as electric motors or electromagnets), or by switching heavy resistive AC loads when zero-crossing circuitry is not used - anywhere a large change of current takes place. One of the purposes of electromagnetic compatibility compliance is to eliminate such sources. An important potential source of dangerous overvoltage is electronic warfare. There is intensive military research in this field, whose goal is to produce various transient electromagnetic devices designed to generate electromagnetic pulses that will disable an enemy's electronic equipment. A recent military development is that of the exploding capacitor designed to radiate a high voltage electromagnetic pulse. Another intense source of an electromagnetic pulse is a nuclear explosion. When Pacific Gas & Electric Company neglected to trim trees that had grown branches into their high power lines, their system caused the world record overvoltage of any power system so far, of 90 minutes in East Palo Alto California on August 25, 2011. The overvoltage caused television sets to catch fire and were thrown out the front doors, exploded light bulbs, fried computers, destroyed surge protectors, blew up the Smart meters, and sparks shot out of wall outlets. The overvoltage only ended when the Smart meters blew up, or after 90 minutes when the power was physically cut. The incident was not reported by PG&E; to the California PUC, only that there was a day-long \\"outage\\" while the exploded system components were being restored. https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2011/09/04/power- surge-raises-questions-about-smartmeters  Conduction path  The transient pulses can get into the equipment either by power or data lines, or directly through space from a strong electromagnetic field change - an electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Filters are used to prevent spikes entering or leaving the equipment through wires, and the devices coupled electromagnetically to space (such as radio-frequency pick-up coils in MRI scanners) are protected by shielding.

It was established by Mirza Koochak Khan, a leader of the Constitutionalist movement of Gilan, and his Jangali (Jungle Movement) partisans, with the assistance of the Soviet Union's Red Army.  Background and history  The Jungle movement that had started in 1914 was further boosted and gained gravity after the victory of the Bolsheviks in Russia. In May 1920 the Soviet Caspian Fleet led by Fedor Raskolnikov and accompanied by Sergo Orzhonikidze entered the Caspian port of Anzali. This mission was declared to be only in pursuit of the Russian vessels and ammunition taken to Anzali by the White Russian counter-revolutionary General Denikin, who had been given asylum by British forces in Anzali. The British garrison in Anzali was soon evacuated without any resistance and the British forces retreated to Manjil. Faced with the conflict between his movement and the united British and central government forces, the Iranian revolutionary Kuchik Khan considered several choices. Mirza had considered seeking support from Bolsheviks when a year before he traveled on foot to Lankaran to meet with them but by the time he arrived in that city, the Red forces had been forced to evacuate. Amongst the Jangalis, there were many who felt that the Bolsheviks offered a real solution to the problems shared by both Russia and Iran, namely the domination of the upper classes and the Imperial Court. Kuchik Khan's second-in-command, Ehsanollah Khan Dustdar, had become a communist and an ardent advocate of an alliance with the Bolsheviks. Kuchik Khan, though hesitant and cautious towards such an idea due to both his religious and nationalist background, accepted and the Jangalis entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks. This cooperation with the Soviet revolutionaries was based on some conditions including the announcement of the Persian Socialist Soviet Republic under his leadership and lack of any direct intervention by the Soviets in the internal affairs of the republic. The Soviets agreed to support him with ammunition and soldiers. Mirza offered to pay for the ammunition but the Soviets refused any payments.  Declaration of the Republic  In May 1920, the Soviet Republic of Gilan, officially known as the Socialist Soviet Republic of Iran, came into being. The Republic did not redistribute land to poor peasants which was considered as a conservative position by the more radical forces of the Jangal movement. Therefore, soon disagreements arose between Mirza and his group of advisors on one side and the Soviets and the Iranian Communist Party (evolved from the Baku-based Edalat (Justice) Party) on the other. Stamp of Iranian Soviet Socialist Republic, 1920, showing the legendary rebel Kaveh the blacksmith - one hand holding a hammer, and the other anachronistically waving the Republic's Red Flag. On June 9, 1920 Mirza Kuchik Khan left Rasht in protest and also to avoid military confrontation (which he had always avoided as much as possible, even while fighting with the central government forces) and opened the way for the Communist (Edalat) party to set a coup d'√©tat. The new administration, formally under Ehsanollah Khan but actually under the influence of Abukov (the Soviet Commissar) started a series of radical activities such as anti- religious propaganda, or forcing money out of the rich landlords. Conservative elements characterized these measures as simply the latest features of longstanding Russian interference in the region, and the middle-class were antagonized by the level of violence, disrespect for property, and the Russian ties of the Jangali movement. The Republic also lost support from the general population due to the exceedingly high number of war refugees who began flooding the urban centers, thus posing a significant economic problem.

By 1921, and particularly after the agreement achieved between the Soviet Union and Britain, the Soviets decided not to further support the Soviet Republic of Gilan. The Russo-Persian Treaty of Friendship (1921) was then signed, ensuring peaceful relations between the two countries and resulting in the withdrawal of Soviet forces. Reza Khan Mirpanj, who had initiated a successful coup d'√©tat with Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabaee several days beforehand, then began reasserting central government control over Gilan and Mazandaran. The Soviet Republic of Gilan officially came to an end in September 1921. Mirza and his German friend Gauook (Hooshang) fled alone into the Alborz Mountains, and died of frostbite. It is said that his body was decapitated by a local landlord and his head was displayed in Rasht to establish the government's new hegemony over revolution and revolutionary ideas.  Historical analysis  Historians have tried to analyze the factors that contributed to the demise of the Jangal movement. Some of the main studies including those by Gregor Yeghikian and Ebrahim Fakhrayi (Minister of Culture in Kuchik Khan's Cabinet of the Soviet Republic) suggest a role for both extremist actions taken by the Communist (Edalat) Party that provoked opposing religious sentiment among the public, and Mirza Kuchik Khan's religious and at times somewhat conservative views on collaboration with the Communist Party as possible factors. It has been suggested also that the change of policy on the Soviet side regarding pursuing global revolution (as advocated by Trotsky) versus establishing and protecting the Soviet Union was the main reason for them to withdraw support from the Gilan Republic. The second option got more support and therefore Soviets signed the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement with the British in London (1921) which required them to retreat from Northern Iran. Correspondence between Theodore Rothstein, the Soviet ambassador in Tehran, and Mirza Koochak Khan clearly supports this view.Ebrahim Fakhrayi. As part of his peace making efforts, Rothstein had also sent a message to the Soviet officers among Ehsanollah Khan's one thousand strong force that had made its way towards Qazvin, not to obey his orders and as a result that campaign was defeated.

More specifically, it is an adjective describing the hip hop music and the culture associated with the area. The term was first coined by Oakland rapper Keak da Sneak. History The hyphy culture emerged in the late 1990s in Oakland before rising to prominence throughout the wider Bay Area in the early 2000s. It is distinguished by gritty, pounding rhythms, and has been compared to crunk music. An individual is said to \\"get hyphy\\" when they dance in an overstated, fast-paced and ridiculous manner, or if they get overloud with other people. The phrase \\"to get hyphy\\" is similar to the southern phrase \\"to get crunk\\". Those who consider themselves part of the hyphy movement strive for this behavior. Although the Hyphy Movement briefly saw light in mainstream America, it has been an established subculture in the Bay Area since the early 1990s. Throughout the Bay Area (particularly in East Oakland), there are events regularly hosted called \\"sideshows\\", where people perform or watch illegal automobile performances. These performances include activities such as donuts, ghost-riding, an action that has proven fatal on multiple occasions, and street racing, while others dance and \\"go dumb\\" around them. The Hyphy Movement's resurgence in early 2006 was cited by prominent Bay Area rapper E-40 as a new opportunity for the Bay Area's unique sound to reach a nationwide audience. For many Bay Area natives, rapper Mac Dre is cited as the individual who spearheaded the general audience's interest in Hyphy music after his sudden death in 2004. Mac Dre's Treal TV DVD special represented everything Hyphy, from what goes on at the sideshows to street slang, and common dances like ‚Äúgoing dumb‚Äù and the ‚Äúthizzle dance‚Äù became popular moves created by Mac Dre.https://www.complex.com/music/2016/06/hyphy-oral-history Many artists, such as Drake and DJ Mustard, pay homage to Mac Dre due to his huge influence in their musical career.https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.38014/title.mac-dres-mother-explains-how- drake-spurred-legend-of-the-bay-documentary# With the start of Mac Dre's label, Thizz Entertainment, he was able to shine a light on local talent such as E-40 and Andre Nickatina, prominent members of the Bay Area rap scene.http://www.waxpoetics.com/blog/features/articles/bay-area-boss-mac-dre/ Post-hyphy =Resurgence in the 2010s= In the early to mid-2010s, the genre of hyphy music saw a resurgence in the mainstream as a part of being a stylistic influence to an up tempo and club oriented type of mainstream hip hop known as \\"ratchet music,\\" which was popularized by various Los Angeles producers, including DJ Mustard. The production style of DJ Mustard is adapted from hyphy music and played a role in bringing West Coast hip hop back to national attention. DJ Mustard has been attached in producing for popular artists' singles, which include: Tyga's, \\"Rack City,\\" 2 Chainz's \\"I'm Different,\\" Young Jeezy's \\"R.I.P.,\\" B.o.B's \\"HeadBand,\\" YG's \\"My Nigga\\" and \\"Who Do You Love?\\" (as well as the majority of his 2014 debut album My Krazy Life), Ty Dolla Sign's \\"Paranoid,\\" Kid Ink's \\"Show Me,\\" Trey Songz's \\"Na Na,\\" Omarion's \\"Post to Be,\\" and Big Sean's \\"I Don't Fuck With You,\\" among others. Among the local, more peripheral acts that achieved success outside of the Bay Area include Lil B, a member of the Berkeley rap group The Pack that has built a strong cult following on the Internet; the Richmond-based hip hop collective HBK Gang with individual members Iamsu!, Kehlani, Sage the Gemini, and P-Lo making their marks in the mainstream ; Oakland-born pop rapper G-Eazy, who has gained two Billboard Top-10 hits with \\"Me, Myself & I\\" and \\"No Limit\\" (the latter featuring ASAP Rocky and Cardi B); and the Vallejo-based quartet SOB x RBE, who found mainstream attention after being featured on the track \\"Paramedic!\\" in the Kendrick Lamar-curated soundtrack album for the 2018 superhero film Black Panther. In November 2011, Canadian hip hop artist Drake released the song \\"The Motto,\\" featuring Young Money labelmate Lil Wayne, as the fourth single for his sophomore album Take Care. The song's instrumental (produced by T-Minus) takes major influence from hyphy music, and was a commercial success in the US‚Äîhaving sold 3,113,000 copies in the US as of April 2013‚Äîdue to the meteoric popularity of the catchphrase YOLO during that time. It peaked atop both the US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs and US Rap Songs charts, and was ranked 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 Year-end Chart. \\"The Motto\\" was also nominated for Best Rap Song at the 55th Grammy Awards. A music video was released on February 10, 2012 and features cameos from Bay Area rappers E-40 and Mistah F.A.B. as well as including an introduction from the mother of Mac Dre, Wanda Salvatto. Salvatto has also said, in a 2016 interview with Complex Media, that Drake told her how Mac Dre influenced him when he was 15 years old, and how important that was to him. = Rise of R&Bass; = DJ Mustard's popularity around the same time began another movement that stemmed from the Bay Area, known as R&Bass.; Coined by producer J Maine, this movement has gained widespread popularity, specifically on the Internet. R&Bass; blends hyphy music with contemporary R&B;, thus garnering crossover appeal. Artists like Jonn Hart, Rayven Justice, and producers like Christopher Dotson embrace the R&Bass; style. As well, through this movement, there have been numerous collaborations with various hyphy artists, including E-40. Influence on electronic and pop music As a result of the recognizably and commonality between many of DJ Mustard's chart-topping singles, a number of artists who employ production similar to his have been criticized for unoriginality and sometimes plagiarism, with some of the biggest offenders of this style rip-off including the 2014 chart-topping Iggy Azalea single, \\"Fancy\\" and \\"Classic Man,\\" the 2015 debut single by rapper Jidenna which samples \\"Fancy\\". However, the popularity of Mustard's style started to gain influence outside of hip hop. In 2012, electronic dance music (EDM), which incorporated elements of southern trap music, began gaining popularity and brought wider attention to the derivative forms of trap, including hyphy, as well as Jamaican Dancehall music. This so-called \\"EDM Trap\\" genre saw the use of techno, dub, and house sounds combined with the Roland TR-808 drum samples and vocal samples typical of trap. In December 2013, French producer DJ Snake and American rapper Lil Jon released the single \\"Turn Down for What\\", which became both a commercial hit charting in several countries and a viral hit throughout 2014. The composition of the song borrows elements from crunk and hyphy songs, and Rolling Stone voted \\"Turn Down For What\\" as the second best song of 2014, saying that, \\"The year's nutsiest party jam was also the perfect protest banger for a generation fed up with everything. DJ Snake brings the synapse- rattling EDM and Southern trap music; Lil Jon brings the dragon-fire holler for a hilarious, glorious, glowstick-punk fuck you.\\" The success of \\"Turn Down for What\\" set the standard for Trap EDM and even Pop music in the mid-2010s, which kept the influence and legacy of hyphy music alive. Among those songs include the DJ Snake and Major Lazer collaboration \\"Lean On,\\" the Skrillex- produced Justin Bieber single \\"Sorry,\\" and the chart-topping 2016 song \\"Closer\\" by American DJ duo The Chainsmokers.

He is one of the pioneers of the Romanian rock performing in two legendary pop-rock bands, Olympic 64 and Phoenix. His love for jazz and jazz / rock led to numerous projects and collaborations with Mircea Tiberian, Marius Popp, Dan Mandrila, Johnny RƒÉducanu, CƒÉtƒÉlin T√¢rcolea, Drago≈ü Nedelcu, Mircea Florian, Nicu Alifantis, Sergiu Cioiu. He has a prestigious activity in avant- garde contemporary music, performing alongside Iancu Dumitrescu / Hyperion Ensemble and participating in the works of other composers such as Vlad Ulpiu, Mihaela Vozganian, Horia Surianu, as well as his personal projects. In parallel, he has worked in the field of architecture for a long time with a successful career in Bucharest, Paris, and Beirut. During all this time he never abandoned his early love for graphics and drawing. He is one of the grandchildren of the painter Costin Petrescu.  Biography  = Music and preparation for architecture = From a very young age, Costin Petrescu showed interest in artistic areas. He took piano lessons early in his life but unfortunately the family instrument had to be sold in order to cover the high cost of living created by the crisis of the '50s after the second world war and the establishment of communism in Romania. However Costin, encouraged by his nanny, immediately substitute the loss of the piano with playing wooden spoons and the various family gastronomic vessels. By the time he turned five, Costin caught the attention of the renowned drummer and musician Sergiu Malagamba, a friend of the family, who predicted a great future in music for the little boy. His mother, member of a well known choir in Bucharest, never stopped to inspire and encouraged him. His music teacher from high school also recognised the talent and supported the purchase of a real set of drums. Soon after, Costin joined the 60s rock group The Pioneers. In 1964, the year of the Tokyo Olympics, The Pioneers became Olympic'64 and the new band quickly established itself with the music fans due to numerous engagements in clubs, concert halls and the Romanian Television. By now Costin greatly developed his drumming capabilities and together with the guitarist Picky Inglessis and his childhood friend Dorin Liviu Zaharia, nicknamed Chubby due to his style that resembled Chubby Checker, they started to write original music. The two rock operas that came out of this collaboration, the Dodecameron of the White Fire and Karma Kaliyuga made history at the Pop-Rock Music Festival organised by the Faculty of Architecture in Bucharest. The communist officials were not impressed with that kind of theatrics and the festival was banned for many years. Meanwhile, Costin attended the Faculty of Architecture Ion Mincu. As he entered the 4th year of studies the band called it quits, but Costin immediately joined another established rock group, Phoenix from Timi»ôoara. With Phoenix, Costin climbed up the pop-rock ladder. The hard work was rewarded by sold-out concerts in Romania and abroad. Three vinyl records, of which two LPs and one Single were produced during this period and the band was invited at music festivals in Bratislava (Czech Republic) and Sopot (Poland). The band is now notorious in Romania but Costin wants something else and he begins a love affair with jazz and other musical forms, listening to Weather Report, Blood Sweet and Tears, Frank Zappa, Miles Davis, John Coltrane or Sun Ra. At the Bucharest university, Costin had the chance to study the great Le Corbusier, to which he attached himself as a \\"fan\\" and a disciple. He travels frequently to Timi»ôoara but the distance between the two cities is somewhat diminished by the tenacity with which he balances the two primordial arts needed in order to express himself. Phoenix is working now on their fourth album, a double one titled Cantafabule, but due to incompatibilities with the leader of the group, Nicolae Covaci, Costin leaves the band during the recordings. This time he moves towards jazz, jazz-rock and ethno-jazz music, performing concerts and recording with top personalities from this area of music: Mircea Tiberian, Marius Popp and Drago≈ü Nedelcu, pianists, Dan Mandrila saxophonist, Johnny RƒÉducanu double bass, CƒÉtƒÉlin Tarcolea flute. He also participates to the recordings and concerts of Mircea Florian, Nicu Alifantis, folk-singers and composers, and the singer and actor Sergiu Cioiu, integrating his participation in various and diverse musical fields. After obtaining the degree in architecture in 1974, Costin follows for six months the Artillery Reserve Officers' School in Braila and then works at Buftea Cinemas Studios as a stage designer. At the end of 1977 he is employed as an architect at a design institute in Bucharest where he remains for many years working on industrial and housing projects. During this period Costin is co-opted as a percussionist by the composer Iancu Dumitrescu, the founder of the contemporary music group Hyperion. Their repertoire consisted of old Romanian music picked and transposed by Anton Pann, Domitian Vlah, Dimitrie Cantemir, Ioan CƒÉianu, Ieromonahul Vlahu, Filotei but also of the music of some Romanian modern composers considered interesting in Europe at that time, including Iancu Dumitrescu, Aurel Stroe, Stefan Niculescu, Corneliu Cezar, Octavian Nemescu, Costin Cazaban, Horia Surianu etc. Costin continues to expand his musical taste by listening continuously to Messiaen, Sch√∂enberg, Stockhausen, Alban Berg, Steve Reich, John Cage, Xenakis (an architect of Romanian-Greek origin), Pierre Schaeffer and others. From this moment, Costin enters the world of the so-called \\"avant-garde music\\", falls in love with the new and vast universal sound and begins to build his own arsenal of percussion instruments needed to reproduce the vibrations inside his head. Hyperion is touring extensively not only in Romania but in other parts of Europe as well: Italy, Austria, Germany, France, Portugal. = Departure from Romania and the pure architecture = At the end of another tour with Hyperion, Costin decides not to return to the homeland. To escape the serious deterioration of the social, economic and political situation in Romania, Costin, with the help of a good, old friend, Mihai Munteanu, an architect himself, settles in Paris. His wife and daughter join him in about two years, but not without difficulty. In Paris the attempts to resume the musical activity failed and at the advice of the great musician Michel Berger and his wife France Gall, whom he had already met, Costin returns to architecture. And it works great! With patience and work, in only three years, he becomes project manager at one of France's most prestigious architectural agencies, the \\"Jean Jaques Ory\\" cabinet. There are many spectacular and interesting large and medium-sized works in Paris and the surroundings, culminating with \\"Washington Plaza\\" a huge restructuring project of the business centre of the same name. The so-called \\"Romanian Revolution\\" of December 1989, finds Costin in Paris with his architect colleagues. He organised immediately with a few friends from the diaspora an association called CRED (Consensus pour la Roumanie Europ√©ene et D√©mocratique) with the idea to help Romania at that precise moment. In addition, he managed to reform Phoenix for a one off concert in the free world at \\"La Cigale\\" in Paris, For several years, Costin worked at two other important Parisian architectural agencies after which he created his own firm, La Strada. Soon he had the opportunity to work for two years in Beirut, Lebanon, leading a design team to build the student dormitories in the new Hadath University Campus. = Business = In 1997, Costin opened in Bucharest \\"Magic Sign\\", a company that imported from France construction and architecture technology. It was a success and there were serious years of work and development. Unfortunately the post-communist era and the Romanian overall system created a lot of problems. During this period he collaborated sporadically with old musicians friends, mainly Mircea Florian and Mircea Baniciu. In 2015 Costin abandoned the business altogether to devote himself completely to his love of music and design. He draws in pen and pencil graphics, visits the most interesting and sophisticated exhibitions in Paris, travels often to Bucharest and spends hours composing, assisted by the computer and using electronic percussion instruments as well as real and virtual tools. In 2018 he wrote the book Between Phoenix and ... Le Corbusier, a dialogue with the prominent Romanian rock historian Nelu Stratone.
