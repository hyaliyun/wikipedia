This 20-room cottage-villa, built in about 1852, was designed by prominent architect Alexander Jackson Davis in the Gothic Revival style. The home was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 2002. The unoccupied mansion was destroyed by a suspicious fire on the evening of November 26, 2018. The house was a total loss.https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2018/11/26/historic-new-rochelle-mansion- burns-down-in-suspicious-fire/ On December 12, 2018, four 13-year old, middle school boys (all local, New Rochelle residents) were arrested and charged in connection with the fire. All were charged as juveniles with misdemeanor third-degree criminal trespass, while one faces a felony charge of fourth- degree arson. The Wildcliff Mansion after a three-alarm fire destroyed it. Image taken on November 27th, 2018. Overview Designed in 1852 by Alexander Jackson Davis, one of the preeminent American architects of the nineteenth century, the house was sited to take full advantage of the dramatic views of the water. Davis‚Äô original plan envisioned the family sitting on the villa's front porch and looking out over the spectacular scenery. The beauty of the house and its site were accented by the progression of the entry drive. The visitor originally entered the property from the north along a private road. The curving drive ascended toward the house, proceeding toward Echo Bay and curving around to the front door. The family who first commissioned the design was one Cyrus Lawton, a close friend of Mr. Davis. Mrs. Lawton was a member of the prominent Davenport family, for whom the entire area is named, and the house was a wedding gift to the couple.Cyrus Lawton Obituary, The New York Times Wildcliff was erected in the early 1850s, during a period when New Rochelle was beginning its transformation from a rural farming community into a residential suburb. Improvements in transportation permitted affluent families to build homes in New Rochelle and commute to work in nearby New York City. The land along the scenic north shore of Long Island Sound was especially sought after and many of Davis' designs were built here. His smaller homes were called \\"cottages\\", and the more substantial ones \\"villas\\", however the terms were frequently combined. Among their typical features were prominent, steep-roofed gables, with elaborately carved bargeboards under their eaves.A. J. Davis and the Gothic Revival, Edna Donnell, Metropolitan Museum Studies, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Sep., 1936) Wildcliff is one of two \\"cottage- villas\\" built by Davis on New Rochelle's waterfront peninsula, Davenport Neck, the other being \\"Sans Souci\\" (or Davenport House).National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, section 8, page 2 After Cyrus Lawton's death in 1902, the property was inherited by his son Newberry Lawton Davenport. It was later purchased by Julius and Clara Prince who moved into the home in 1914. Clara Prince donated Wildcliff to the City of New Rochelle in 1940 with the hopes that it would be used as a natural science museum.\\"Wildcliff Youth Museum\\", manuscript printed by the City of New Rochelle, in collection of New Rochelle Public Library (New Rochelle Museums - Wildcliff File) Clara Prince's obituary, \\"Mrs. Julius Prince\\", The New York Times, September 14, 1941, page 49, notes that she was a \\"philanthropist who had given generously to educational projects\\" and that she was especially known for the donation of Wildcliff to New Rochelle in 1940, ten years after the city had tried in vain to purchase the property. It has since been used for a variety of purposes including a youth museum and performing arts center.The Preserver - Highlighting New Rochelle's Rich Past Around 1970 a wing housing a theater was added at one corner of the house but the main structure remains intact.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, section 8, page 7 Since late 2010, the local organization Jen's Community at Wildcliff has been working with the City of New Rochelle and its citizens to bring awareness to the building and to create a preschool and education center.Jen's Community at Wildcliff> Architecture detail Wildcliff is a 2¬Ω-story house faced primarily in rubblestone of various colors. These stones give the picturesque design a natural quality, as if the building were rising out of the landscape. For a house in the Northeast, Downing prescribed a design with high roofs, thick walls, warm rooms, and chimneys. The original front facade of the building was on the southern portion of the present house facing Long Island Sound, now partially obscured by the out-of-character one story addition used as a theater. This facade originally had a 2¬Ω-story central gable with a pair of windows on the first story looking out over the water. In the mid 1860s, Davis designed additions to the house in the same style with special efforts made so that the changes would be as inconspicuous as possible. Bargeboards and other ornamental details match exactly and stonework was laid so that there would be no sign of the joint between the old and new sections.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, section 8, page 7Roberta Hershenson, Vision Takes On Reality as Group Inches Closer to a Stage of Its Own, The New York Times, March 26, 20062006 EPF Grant Awards, Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, October 20, 2006 and Accompanying 6 photos, exterior and interior, from 2002 Later owners Julius and Clara Prince were responsible for the second major expansion to the home which was done in the half-timbered Tudor style. The additions consisted of the construction of a porte-cochere, a new entrance on the south facade of the home, and the conversion of the original entrance into a long, twelve-part window.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, section 8, page 6 The original plan of the house can still be read on the interior. To the south is the original library and entrance hall, now combined into one space. On the upper floors are bedrooms with steeply sloping walls reflecting their locations within the gables. The attic retains some original floorboards and four paneled doors with original knobs. The interior retains much of its historic plan and some historic fittings, but much of the interior detail has been lost.

Designed to Air Ministry specifications which led to no contracts for any manufacturer, only one Beagle was built. Development The B.T. in the Beagle's designation stood for bomber and torpedo, the first aircraft that Blackburn had built for both roles. Its design was started to Air Ministry specification 24/25 for a high-altitude bomber, but was later modified to meet specification 23/25 for a day bomber, reconnaissance and torpedo aircraft. The Beagle was a single-bay biplane with staggered and slightly swept wings. The fabric-covered wings, which did not fold as the aircraft was not intended for carrier service, had spruce spars and ribs with metal bracing. Four ailerons were fitted. The fuselage followed standard Blackburn practice with a steel tube centre section and wooden construction aft, though the final section was again of tube steel; covering was fabric throughout. Fin area was small and the rudder large, with a horn balance initially merging into the fin but later reduced, leaving a prominent step similar to that of the Blackburn Nautilus. The braced tailplane had significantly greater elevator than stabiliser area, the former also having prominent horn balances. The undercarriage was of the split type required by the torpedo dropping role, but a carrier mechanism between the legs could also hold a 185 imp gal (840 L) fuel tank for reconnaissance work. Cockpits were open with the pilot in front, armed with a forward-firing .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun mounted on the port side. The gunner's cockpit was close to the pilot's for communication. He had a Scarff ring-mounted .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun, but to fulfil his role as torpedo or bomb aimer, he moved into a prone position in a station below the pilot's cockpit. This had a bombsight, used via an opening with a sliding door in the bottom of the fuselage and had bomb fusing and release controls plus altitude and airspeed gauges and a hand- operated rudder control for yaw corrections on target. The Beagle was initially powered by a 460 hp (340 kW) Bristol Jupiter VIIIF radial engine mounted in a smooth and rather pointed nosecone, leaving the tops of the nine cylinders exposed. After the competitive trials it was re-engined with a supercharged 590 hp (440 kW) Jupiter XF, though the extra power seems not to have led to significant performance improvement. This installation had a more pointed cowling, with more cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The Beagle flew first at Brough Aerodrome on 18 February 1928 piloted by W.S. Bulman. The rudder modification mentioned above was made before the aircraft went to competitive trial. Operational history Trials took place at RAF Martlesham Heath in July 1929, where the Beagle was ranged against the Gloster Goring, the Handley Page Hare, the Hawker Harrier and the Westland Witch. None of these aircraft met the performance requirements, but as it had received favourable handling reports, the Beagle, along with the Vickers Vildebeest and Hare, was chosen for further testing. It was re-engined and returned to Martlesham in March 1931. By this time, however, the Vildebeest had already been chosen to meet the RAFs requirements for a torpedo bomber. The Beagle remained operational until October 1933.

It means that without time off from work, a person becomes both bored and boring. The exact origins of the phrase remain unclear, though it was recorded as early as 1659. History Though the spirit of the proverb had been expressed previously, the modern saying appeared first in James Howell's Proverbs in English, Italian, French and Spanish (1659), and was included in later collections of proverbs. It also appears in Howell's Paroimiographia (1659), p. 12\\\\. Some writers have added a second part to the proverb, as in Harry and Lucy Concluded (1825) by the Irish novelist Maria Edgeworth: Uses in popular media The proverb has been used widely throughout popular media, notably including ‚ÄúThe Andy Griffith Show‚Äù season 5 episode 30 James Joyce's 1914 short story \\"Araby\\" to Jack Kerouac's 1962 novel Big Sur, the 1933 Laurel & Hardy film Sons of the Desert, the 1957 film The Bridge on the River Kwai, the 1966 film Thunderbirds Are Go, and the 1980 horror film The Shining, directed by Stanley Kubrick. In Kubrick's film the main character, Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson), is found to have abandoned the novel he was writing in favor of typing this sentence over and over onto reams of paper. A number of other works have subsequently included a direct homage to the scene. It was also referenced in The Office in 2008. In the Harvey Street Kids episode \\"Clinging in the Rain\\", this was parodied as \\"All rain and no play makes Dot a dull girl.\\". In the TV show Twin Peaks episode ‚ÄúZen, or the Skill to Catch a Killer‚Äù, this was parodied as ‚ÄúAll work and no play makes Ben and Jerry dull boys.‚Äù. Referenced in Season 5, Ep25 of Hogan‚Äôs Heroes. 3/20/70. Colonel Hogan mentioned the phrase in a conversation with Colonel Klink.

Life He was educated at the University of London, receiving his B.Sc. in 1895 and his M.D. in 1903. In 1893, he was awarded the John Stuart Mill Studentship in Philosophy of Mind and Logic, and four years later was elected a Fellow of University College. From 1902 until his death in 1919, he was employed as medical officer in various English prisons. He was highly regarded among those who knew him for his scientific imagination, logic and excellent prose. His colleague Karl Pearson once said: \\"The creative mind has the potentiality of poet, artist and scientist within its grasp, and Goring's friends were never very certain in which category to place him.\\" The English Convict Goring's crowning achievement was The English Convict: a statistical study, one of the most comprehensive criminological works of its time. It was first published in 1913, and set out to establish whether there were any significant physical or mental abnormalities among the criminal classes that set them apart from ordinary men, as suggested by Cesare Lombroso. Under the sponsorship of the British government, Goring, assisted by other prison medical officers, as well as Karl Pearson and his staff at the Biometrics Laboratory, collected and analysed data bearing upon 96 traits of each of over 3,000 English convicts. He ultimately concluded that \\"the physical and mental constitution of both criminal and law-abiding persons, of the same age, stature, class, and intelligence, are identical. There is no such thing as an anthropological criminal type.\\" He did, however, assert that it is an \\"indisputable fact that there is a physical, mental, and moral type of normal person who tends to be convicted of crime: that is to say, our evidence conclusively shows that, on average, the criminal of English prisons is markedly differentiated by defective physique - as measured by stature and body weight, by defective mental capacity\\". Goring went on to argue that one of the three measures in which to combat crime was to \\"regulate the reproduction of those degrees of constitutional qualities - feeble-minded, inebriety, epilepsy, social instinct, etc\\".

The Couey House was built in the early 1840s by Andrew McSelland Couey and his sons. These people were one of the first family's to settle in Chattooga county. The house was originally made out of logs that were cleared from the land on which the house was built. However, Dowdy Park is not the original place where the house was built; it was moved there in the 1990s due to highway construction. Another one of the historic landmarks is the Summerville railroad turntable and the train depot. The depot was constructed in 1889 and added to the Georgia central railroad system in 1901.

She was the second of ten children born to Knut Kvaale (1852‚Äì1942) and Kaja Augusta Wiig (1863‚Äì1948). She worked as a teacher for 30 years in S√∏r-Odal in Hedmark. She made her literary debut in 1935 with the novel Allis s√∏nn. Her deep psychological insight and great environmental descriptions ensured her a lasting place in Norwegian literature. Eventually she wrote nearly 30 books. Haalke made use of strong, colorful language and lush figures of speech. Her novels often focused on adult insensitive treatment of defenseless youth. The role of the mother in childhood development was a frequent subject. In several books she wrote of values relating to childhood environment and family traditions. Her trilogy √Ökfestet (1936), Dagblinket (1937) and R√∏d haust? (1941) describes the fate of a woman growing up on a small farm. The trilogy was later reworked into two books Grys saga (1950). The trilogy Karenanna Velde (1946), Kaja Augusta (1947) and Kvinneverden (1954) is from a rural district on the coast of Tr√∏ndelag. Her final work was her autobiography Mot nytt liv, written at the age of ninety-two. Haalke was awarded Gyldendal's Endowment in 1949 and the Dobloug Prize in 1980. She was the first recipient of Mads Wiel Nygaards Endowment, which she was awarded in 1953 and which she shared with novelist, Lizzie Juvkam (1883‚Äì1969).

Filmed over the course of four years, Garbage Dreams follows three teenage boys growing up in Egypt's garbage village. Garbage Dreams aired on the PBS program Independent Lens for the occasion of Earth Day 2010 and has been screened in many international film festivals. Synopsis Garbage Dreams follows three teenage boys born into the trash trade and growing up in the world's largest garbage village, on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt. It is the home to 60,000 Zaballeen, also spelled \\"Zabbaleen\\" as Arabic for \\"garbage people.\\" Far ahead of any modern \\"Green\\" initiatives, the Zaballeen survive by recycling 80 percent of the garbage they collect. When their community is suddenly faced with the globalization of its trade, each of the teenage boys is forced to make choices that will impact his future and the survival of his community. Release Garbage Dreams premiered at the 2009 SXSW Film Festival, where it ran in the US Documentary Competition Garbage Dreams had its international premiere in Europe at the twenty-second International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam and its Middle Eastern premiere at the Dubai International Film Festival. Garbage Dreams was shortlisted for the 2010 Academy Awards in the category of Best Feature Length Documentary, was nominated for the 2010 Best Documentary by the Director's Guild of America, and has won 26 international awards including the Al Gore Reel Current Award and IDA Humanitas Award.

It was an experimental-scale reactor. The maximum output was 25 kW and was fueled by plutonium and cooled by liquid mercury. Clementine was located at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Clementine was designed and built in 1945‚Äì1946 and first achieved criticality in 1946 and full power in 1949. The reactor was named after the song \\"Oh My Darling, Clementine.\\" The similarities to the song were that the reactor was located in a deep canyon and the reactor operators were 49'ers, as 49 (last digits of element 94, isotope 239) was one of the code names for plutonium at the time. The primary goal of Clementine was to determine nuclear properties of materials for nuclear weapons research after the Manhattan project. A number of other experiments were performed at the reactor, including investigation of the feasibility of civilian breeder reactors, and measuring neutron cross sections of various materials. Core design The core was contained in a long mild steel cylinder that had an inside diameter of and a wall thick. The fuel assembly was in diameter tall and contained 55 fuel elements. Each fuel element was composed of Œ¥-phase plutonium-239. They were each diameter and long. The fuel elements were clad in thick plain carbon steel. The core was located at the bottom of the steel cylinder. The core was cooled by liquid mercury. The maximum thermal output was 25 kW. The mercury was circulated through the core and out to a mercury-water heat exchanger at a maximum flow rate of by an induction type electromagnetic pump with no moving parts. Shielding and support structure The reactor core was wrapped in a series of neutron reflectors and shielding structures, starting with a 15 cm (6 in.) thick cylindrical blanket of natural uranium immediately surrounding the core. This blanket was open at the top and bottom and could be moved up and down. Next was a 15.2 cm (6 in.) thick steel reflector and 10 cm (4 in.) of lead. Finally, most of the reactor was surrounded by multiple laminations of steel and boron plastic. This entire assembly was surrounded and supported by a thick concrete shell that provided additional shielding. A number of holes ran through the shielding to provide fast neutrons to the various physics experiments. Reactor control The reactor was the first reactor to demonstrate reaction control via control of delayed neutrons, this was more of a function of being one of the very early reactors, rather than a special design feature. Control was accomplished by several means. The uranium blanket described above could be raised and lowered. 238U is a good neutron reflector, so the position of the blanket controlled the number of neutrons available to the reaction. When the blanket was raised, more neutrons were reflected back into the core, causing a greater number of fissions and, consequently, greater power output. Additionally, there were two shutdown/control rods composed of natural uranium and boron that was enriched in the boron-10 isotope. 10B is a very effective neutron poison that could be inserted to control and shut down the reaction. Shutdown of the reactor involved simultaneously dropping the uranium blanket and inserting the two control rods into the center which, absorbed neutrons and poisoned the reaction. Up to 20 other holes were available in the core for experimental configurations or additional control or fuel rods. Use and shutdown Clementine operated successfully from 1946 until 1950 when the reactor was shut down to correct a problem with the control and shim rods. During this shutdown it was noted that one of the natural uranium rods had ruptured. It was replaced and the reactor was restarted. It was again operated successfully until 1952 when the cladding on one of the fuel rods ruptured. This caused contamination of the primary cooling loop with plutonium and other fission products. At this time it was decided that all the primary objectives of Clementine had been achieved and the reactor was permanently shut down and dismantled. Results of the Clementine experiment The experience and data provided by operating the Clementine reactor was very useful for both military and civilian applications. One of the notable achievements of the Clementine project included measurements for the total neutron cross sections of 41 elements to a 10% accuracy. Additionally, Clementine provided invaluable experience in the control and design of fast neutron reactors. It was also determined that mercury was not an ideal cooling medium for this type of reactor due to its poor heat transfer characteristics.

The Northampton and Peterborough Railway Act received the Royal Assent in 1843 and the line opened in 1845. In 1846, it became part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). The LNWR became a constituent of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) when the railways of Great Britain were merged in the grouping of 1923. In 1948, the LMS became part of the publicly owned British Railways. Regular passenger services ceased in 1964 and the line closed completely in 1972. A part of it has since been reopened as the Nene Valley Railway heritage line. Origin Competing schemes There had been two original schemes for lines between London and Birmingham. One proposed by John Rennie would go via Oxford and Banbury. The other proposed by Francis Giles would go via Bletchley, Rugby and Coventry. Amalgamation In 1830 the two decided to amalgamate, adopting Rennie's plan which, as a canal builder, he had laid out following fairly level country. George Stephenson was asked to plan the line and he passed it to his son Robert who carried out a further survey favouring a route very similar to that proposed by Giles, much to the annoyance of Rennie. Northampton bypassed While there was a certain amount of opposition from landowners, the people of Northampton were much in favour of the line. However, in the end, it bypassed the town, following higher ground to the west, through Blisworth and Weedon. At that time it was normal for new lines to bypass the larger towns because of inherent complication and the cost of land. On the other hand, in those days, the time taken to travel to the station was not seen as a handicap, given that the total journey would be much quicker than anything that had been known before. In addition, a rail link to Weedon Barrackssee Weedon Bec was seen as strategically important. The Peterborough line The London and Birmingham Railway opened in 1838 and, four years later, a delegation from Northampton approached the directors with a proposal to build a branch which would run through to Peterborough, which at that time also had no railway although a number of schemes were being proposed.Butler, P., (2007) A History of the Railways of Northamptonshire,' Great Addington: Silver Link Publishing The Bill for the line's construction met considerable opposition from those who favoured the Northern and Eastern Railway which was progressing to Cambridge and Peterborough.http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1843/feb/28/northampton- and-peterborough-railway Hansard 28 February 1843 vol 67 cc14-6 Northampton and Peterborough Railway Bill However the Northampton and Peterborough Railway Act received the Royal Assent in 1843. Construction Once again the engineer was Robert Stephenson. The line would be relatively easy to build, following the valley of the River Nene to Peterborough, with only a small tunnel to the west of Wansford. Stations would be provided wherever the line crossed a turnpike where there would be level crossings. Most of the line was raised on embankments because of the likelihood of flooding. In spite of this it occurred from time to time. In 1852 for instance several bridges were swept away and the line was closed for a week. Opening The line opened from Blisworth to Northampton in May 1845 and then throughout in June, the 47 miles having taken only a year to build. The station at Blisworth was rebuilt next to the junction, and Northampton people at last had their train service to London. In 1846 the line, along with the London and Birmingham, became part of the London and North Western Railway. Track doubling Although the infrastructure of the line had been built for double track, only a single track was laid from Northampton to Peterborough, with a passing loop at Thrapston. This single line working was facilitated by the installation of electric telegraph. However it became clear that the traffic would be such that doubling would be required very quickly and this was completed by September 1846. Two stations were unusual to say the least. One, Ringstead and Addington was approached on foot from one direction by means of stepping stones. Another, Ditchford was said to be the location of famous treacle mines. Train services There were five trains each way on weekdays and Saturdays, with two on Sunday, and extra services between Northampton and Blisworth. Initially the goods traffic was cattle and coal but later iron ore became important. Connections In 1857 the Midland Railway built a line from Wigston to meet the GNR at Hitchin via Wellingborough. It built a spur to the LNWR station for goods. In 1861 the LNWR began running trains from Wichnor near Burton on Trent and the Midland then began running trains between Wellingborough and Northampton. The Midland built a small station in 1866 near the LNWR's (the latter becoming Northampton Bridge Street in 1876). This little station closed in 1872 when the Midland built its main line from Bedford and opened a new station at St John Street. In 1881, the LNWR opened the Northampton Loop Line which placed the town on a through service superseding Blisworth. At grouping in 1923 it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway. Closure The use of level crossings had reduced the costs of building the line, but it greatly increased operating expenses and it became be a major reason for the line being closed to passengers by British Rail in 1964. Some passenger trains still ran from the boarding school at Oundle until 1972 when the line closed completely. The Northampton and Peterborough Railway closed in 1964, followed 2 years later by the closure of Peterborough East station and the passenger services to Rugby The line between Rugby and Nassington remained open until the line was finally closed with the track remained in situ. The remaining village stations including Helpston and Ketton & Collyweston on the Syston and Peterborough Railway ceased in the same year, although line remains open with through passenger services.

He built his wealth by transforming a small, bankrupt dry goods store in Downtown Los Angeles into the prominent The Broadway department store, later adding the Bullock's store.  Early years  Arthur Letts Sr. was born in Holdenby, Northamptonshire, England. In 1882 he emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and found employment in a large dry goods store. When the Red River Rebellion broke out in the Northwest of Canada, he volunteered. He was awarded a silver medal and clasp for distinguished service, and a grant of land by the Canadian government. In the early 1890s, he emigrated to the United States in Seattle, Washington and began retail employment in dry goods.  Los Angeles   The Broadway  Letts arrived in the Los Angeles, California area in 1896. At the corner of Fourth and Broadway, then on the far southern edge of the downtown Los Angeles business district, the J. A. Williams & Co. Dry Goods Store had gone bankrupt. With the help of an influential friend, who was impressed with Letts' knowledge of that type of business, a loan of $5000 was secured from the Los Angeles National Bank, and opened his business on February 24, 1896.

After Letts' death, Bullock and a group of investors purchased the store from the estate.  Westwood, UCLA, and, Holmby Hills  The development of Westwood, Holmby Hills, and UCLA began in 1919 when Arthur Letts Sr. purchased a portion of the Wolfskill Ranch, originally the Mexican land grant Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres. His master plan for the prime land he had purchased in western Los Angeles. was to create a mixed development of retail, apartments, residences, estates, and significant university. He personally christened the developments Westwood and \\"Holmby Hills,\\" the latter loosely derived from the name of his birthplace, a small village in England called Holdenby. Arthur Letts Sr. died suddenly in 1923, before he could realize his vision.  Community  Letts joined a number of organizations. He was member of the Hollywood Masonic Lodge, the Knights Templar, the prestigious California Club in Downtown Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Athletic Club, the elite Los Angeles Country Club, and the Midwick Country Club in Alhambra in the San Gabriel Valley. He was also a member of the Nationally exclusive Bohemian Club on the Russian River in Sonoma County of Northern California. He was involved with the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, the Realty Board, the Hollywood Board of Trade, the Federation Club, and the Automobile Club of Southern California.

The grounds of his Los Feliz district, Hollywood estate Holmby HouseArthur Letts residence, also called Holmby House, Hollywood, ca.1905 were formally laid out with wide variety of trees, shrubs, and flowers, and his cactus collection was known across the country. It was bound by Franklin Avenue, Vermont Avenue, Los Feliz Boulevard, and Laughlin Park. The gardens were open to the public for tours, with the Pacific Electric Railway stopping at it. It was his wish that the gardens be continued even after his death. Upon his death in May 1923, his wife, at the suggestion of son-in-law Harold Janss of Janss Investment Company (who lived at the back of the property), demolished the gardens and mansion in 1927 to subdivide and develop the land, and moved to a new residence in Holmby Hills.James Miller Guinn, 1915, A History of California and an Extended History of Los Angeles and Environs, p. 891, Historic Record Company, Los Angeles, California She had remarried by June, 1924 to Charles Quinn.

Prettyman later became a successful businessman and civic leader, operating a boarding house, a laundry service, a power company and the Ann Arbor Press, and holding office as an Ann Arbor city councilman, postmaster and Washtenaw County, Michigan supervisor. Early years Prettyman was born in Stryker, Ohio, and raised in Bryan, Ohio. He was the son of Lewis Prettyman, a farmer, and Hannah (Kintigh) Prettyman. 1882 and 1883 football seasons Prettyman attended Ann Arbor High School and subsequently enrolled in the University of Michigan in 1882 at age 24 and excelled as an athlete. In addition to football, Prettyman also won competitions in the hammer throw, boxing and wrestling. In 1882, Prettyman was a \\"rusher\\" for the Michigan football team. However, the team played no intercollegiate games. Horace Prettyman from 1883 team photograph. In 1883, Michigan resumed a schedule of intercollegiate football, and Prettyman played \\"forward\\" for the team. The team played its first ever home gamePrior to 1883, Michigan had played most of its games as a visitor. Its rare home game had been played in Detroit. at the Ann Arbor Fairgrounds in March 1883, a 40-5 win over the Detroit Independents. Prettyman scored the first touchdown at the Fairgrounds at the 14-minute mark of the \\"first inning\\" and went on to score a second touchdown before the end of the inning. The team played its remaining games as part of an Eastern trip in November 1883. The trip consisted of four road games in eight days at Wesleyan and Yale in Connecticut, Harvard in Massachusetts, and Stevens Institute in Hoboken, New Jersey. The trip cost $3,000 and was arranged \\"to both represent and advertise the college among the Eastern cities and universities.\\" Prettyman was placed in charge of the trip, and The Michigan Argonaut praised his management: \\"All the boys are most hearty in their commendation of Prettyman's excellent management of the financial interests of the trip and his success is seen by the fact that every expense of the trip has been paid to the last cent.\\" Prettyman from the 1884 team photograph On the trip, the team lost to Yale 46‚Äì0, the worst defeat to that time in the history of Michigan football. The Yale game was played on a Saturday, and Michigan played Harvard the next day, losing 3‚Äì0. The second half was played largely in darkness, and the Boston Journal said of the play: > \\"All that could really be called a game was the first half before the > intermission, the latter half being nothing more than a scramble because of > the darkness. ... [T]he pitch dark for the whole of this half prevented the > teams from distinguishing friend from foe. It was one continuous scramble, > and the spectators were unable to distinguish any of the actions.\\" Late in the game, Michigan appeared to have scored the winning touchdown on a trick play, called \\"the time-honored fake run.\\" Prettyman began running with teammate (and future Boston Red Sox owner) Henry Killilea behind him. Just before being tackled, Prettyman passed the ball to Killilea, who ran for the touchdown while Prettyman ran \\"head-on into the Harvard full-back.\\" The Harvard umpire called the ball was \\"down\\" where Prettyman had been tackled, and the referee ordered it back to the midfield and called the game on account of darkness. Some claimed that the Harvard umpire had not seen the play due to the darkness, and had called Prettyman down at the urging of a Harvard player. The Michigan team arranged to stay and play another game the next day. However, according to a 1920 history of the University of Michigan, Harvard refused and instead \\"pleaded faculty interference and paid a $100 forfeit.\\" After the final game of the Eastern trip against Stevens Institute, The New York Times noted that Killilea and Prettyman \\"did some of the best work for the Michigan men in the way of running and tackling.\\" 1884 and 1885 football seasons Prettyman from 1885 team photograph In 1884, Prettyman was chosen as captain of the football team. The team won both of its intercollegiate games, including an 18 to 10 win in its first match against its eventual rival, the University of Chicago. The team beat Albion College 18 to 0 in its other game in 1884. Prettyman received his bachelor's degree in 1885, but stayed on at the university as a graduate student from 1885 to 1886. In 1885, Prettyman was again selected as captain and led the football team to its second consecutive undefeated season. The 1885 team did not allow its opponents to score a single point, outscoring them 82 to 0. 1886 football season Prettyman sports a full beard in the 1888 team photograph In 1886, Prettyman was selected as captain of the football team for the third straight year. No player before or since has been selected as captain of the Michigan football team more than twice. The 1886 team played two games, both against Albion College. Michigan won the first game at Albion by a score of 50 to 0. The Michigan Argonaut credited Prettyman for his fine play in the game. The second game was played at the Ann Arbor Fairgrounds as part of a \\"field day\\" that included various athletic events. Michigan won the football game 24 to 0, and the Argonaut reported that \\"Prettyman's play was characterized by his usual heavy rushing.\\" In Prettyman's three years as captain, Michigan never lost a game, winning seven games and losing none over the three-year span, and outscoring opponents 192 to 10. 1888 to 1890 football seasons Prettyman from the 1889 team photograph Prettyman worked as a traveling salesman from 1886 to 1887, general manager of Bulles & Co. (an Ann Arbor manufacturer of gelatin capsules) in 1888, and a real estate agent and hotel manager starting in 1889. Though he was no longer a student, college football eligibility standards were loose, and Prettyman returned to play three more years for Michigan, as the team's center in 1888, and as a tackle in 1889 and 1890. In 1888, the team was undefeated, having beaten Notre Dame twice, going into the final game of the year against the University of Chicago. Michigan lost the game 26‚Äì4 in front of a crowd of 2,500 persons, and Prettyman was \\"disqualified for striking one of the U.C. team.\\" The 1889 rematch against Chicago was played on icy grass and mud-colored snow with a 40-mile-an-hour wind. Prettyman was again involved in a fight that resulted in his expulsion from the game. One Chicago newspaper described the incident this way: > \\"In the main, the players kept their tempers very well during the excitement > of the struggle but while the second half was in, Prettyman, the big rusher > of the Michigan team who was mixed up in a fracas during the game of last > year, forgot himself and slugged one of the Chicago men vigorously. This > came near bringing on a fight and the crowd broke into the field and > surrounded the players closely while the occupants of the grand stand hissed > the unexpected display. The cooler players, however, quickly brought the > others to their senses, and the tempest was soon over. The police cleared > the field and play was resumed, but not until Prettyman had been ruled off > and Hull substituted for him.\\" In 1890, Prettyman played as part of the first racially integrated football team at Michigan, alongside African-American teammate George Jewett. Family and later years Prettyman married Jennie McNames in June 1887, and the two operated a boarding house at 602 Lawrence Street in Ann Arbor that was known as the Campus Club, also known as Prettyman's Boarding House. Mr. and Mrs. Prettyman charged $1.50 per week for a room and $2.50 per week for board. Prettyman was a member of the Ann Arbor City Council from 1891 to 1895, president of the Ann Arbor Municipal League from 1892 to 1894, and a Washtenaw County supervisor starting in 1901. Prettyman sold his boarding house to the University in 1914 and later became the principal owner and president of the Ann Arbor Press and the president of the White Swan Laundry and the Wolverine Power Company. He was also Ann Arbor's postmaster for a time starting in 1906. Prettyman died in March 1945 at age 87 at St. Joseph's Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor.

Biography Digby was born in London, the son of Edward Aylmer Digby by marriage to Winifred Digby Watson, his first cousin. Digby's paternal grandfather was Sir Kenelm Edward Digby, a lawyer who was Permanent Under- Secretary in the British Home Office from 1895 to 1903; his father was also a lawyer, who had commanded a warship in the Great War and had stood unsuccessfully for parliament as both a Liberal and a Labour candidate. Digby was educated at Lydgate House Preparatory School and then Gresham's School, in Norfolk before he read philosophy, politics and economics (PPE) at St John's College, Oxford. The Oxford Union's debating chamber In 1933, at a debate in the Oxford Union, Digby proposed the motion \\"That this House would in no circumstances fight for its King and country\\". The debate was lively, and the motion was eventually carried by 275 votes to 153. A nationwide furore followed, and Digby and his fellow undergraduates were accused of sending the dangerous message to Europe's dictators that the British were soft and would not fight. Isis, a student magazine of the University of Oxford, reported that Digby had a \\"tub-thumping style of oratory which would be more appreciated in Hyde Park than in the Union\\". Sixty years after the event, Digby mused, \\"It was just a debate. I don't know what all the fuss was about. Frank Hardie had asked me to propose the motion and I agreed. That's all there was to it. But ever since the debate security intelligence organisations seem to have taken an interest in me\\". Digby kept the white feathers that he was given after the debate. In 1934, he was called to the Bar and, a few days later, sailed to Kuching in Sarawak as a newly-recruited District Officer to work for Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke, last of the White Rajahs of Sarawak. He returned to England at the end of his contract in 1939 and went into chambers as a pupil of Neil Lawson, who subsequently became a High Court Judge. On the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the National Council for Civil Liberties as an unpaid volunteer while he was awaiting his call-up, having no intention of registering as a conscientious objector. In the spring of 1940, he was asked to return to Sarawak, where he was appointed as Legal Adviser to Rajah Charles Brooke and as a member of the Rajah's Council. He played an important role in drafting Sarawak's 1941 constitution. With the Japanese invasion of Borneo, Sarawak was occupied by the Japanese in December 1941, and the Europeans were interned, first in houses and prisons in Kuching and then at the Batu Lintang camp, outside Kuching. Digby spent three-and a-half-years there until he was liberated in September 1945. In 1940, Digby met Mutal Fielding on a P&O; liner on the way back to Kuching, and they became engaged in Singapore in 1941. Mutal lived in Hong Kong, and before they could be married, the war intervened. Mutal was interned at Stanley Internment Camp, and among the many other internees was Kenelm's cousin Professor Kenelm Hutchinson Digby, who was the head of surgery at Hong Kong University. Digby and Mutal were finally reunited in November 1945 in Southampton, when Digby arrived home on HMS Ranchi. The Digbys were married on 21 February 1946 at Sherfield English, near Romsey, Hampshire, before he returned to Sarawak. Digby rejoined the Sarawak Civil Service as Legal Adviser, rising to become Attorney-General and editor of the Sarawak Gazette and a circuit judge. Digby's appointment as a circuit judge ended in 1951, and he returned to London and practised briefly at the bar. He also found alternative work as a deputy coroner to five London boroughs. In 1955, he and his wife migrated to New Zealand, tempted by the dominion's assisted migration scheme. He worked as a solicitor for the State Advances Corporation in Wellington for five years and was appointed solicitor to the Department of Health. He retired in 1977, and in the 1978 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire. He was also a Companion of the Star of Sarawak. He died on 5 August 2001 after a fall in his garden and was survived by Mutal and their three children. For Digby, the fallout from the Oxford debate of 1933 lasted many decades. A lifelong socialist but never a communist, Digby's suspected communism made him unpopular with the authorities in Sarawak and brought his career there to a premature end, and he was rarely briefed by solicitors when he worked as a barrister in England. In 1980, he published a memoir, Lawyer in the Wilderness. After his death, his widow commented, \\"That Oxford Union motion haunted him. It dogged him wherever he went\\".

A contract was signed after four days discussions and shooting was happening only for two hours content in a day, after which differences increased between them while channels gave them time until 30 October 2008 to sort it out.

The line was a reaction to DC Comics' 1984 deal with Kenner Products for the Super Powers Collection. Mattel, concerned about losing the DC account to Kenner, made a similar deal with Marvel. Mattel's request was that the line would be supported with an event comic book that included the words \\"secret\\" and \\"wars\\", which Mattel's market research found worked particularly well with children in focus groups. Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter came up with the concept for a year-long twelve-issue crossover called Secret Wars, in which Marvel's most popular heroes and villains would be plucked out of their daily lives to a distant galaxy, where they would be given alien weapons and technology and forced to fight each other. Some of Mattel's choices for the toy line impacted the look and direction of Marvel's superhero characters. Shooter introduced the idea of a new, black costume for Spider-Man, which was not intended to last for long, but Mattel was very enthusiastic, because it allowed them to sell two versions of the same toy. The \\"alien costume\\" was revealed in The Amazing Spider-Man to be a living creature, who separated from Spider-Man to become a new character, Venom. At Mattel's request, Marvel designed updated, \\"high-tech\\" costumes for Iron Man and Doctor Doom. Mattel also requested new female characters, and Marvel introduced two villains, Titania and Volcana, as well as a new version of Spider-Woman, Julia Carpenter. None of the three female characters were produced as part of the toy line. In fact, while dozens of characters were involved in the comic miniseries, Mattel's initial Secret Wars series only included eight characters: four heroes (Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America and Wolverine) and four villains (Doctor Doom, Doctor Octopus, Kang the Conqueror and Magneto). The line included two series of action figures, along with vehicles and playsets, as well as a third series of figures released outside North America. Figures Figures were 4 inches [115 mm] tall. They came packaged in a bubble-card pack. The back of the packaging card came with a character illustration and biography, a short 4-panel comic, and a depiction of available figures in the series. They each came with a large plastic \\"Secret Shield\\" accessory that held a lenticular image. Heroes carried circular red shields and villains carried square gray shields, which were supposed to represent a sort of video communicator. The lenticular \\"secret identity\\" image was viewable through a clear plastic window in the top cover of the shield and shifted between showing either the character's costumed or secret identities. There was also a packet of four lenticular \\"secret message\\" cartoon inserts that came with each character that fit in the Secret Shield. Series 1 The back of the packaging card had a character illustration and biography, a 4-panel comic of the character in action, and pictures of all eight Series 1 figures. * Captain America - Captain America only came with a Secret Shield accessory rather than his iconic shield. His Secret Shield \\"secret identity\\" insert showed Captain America's face over the same concentric red, white, and blue-circle-inset-with-a-white-star ring pattern. * Doctor Doom - Comes with both a laser pistol and a laser rifle. The rifle fit in a socket in the back of the torso and the pistol could be attached to a green plastic holder on Doom's upper right leg. * Doctor Octopus - Comes with Doc Ock's signature silver plastic tentacles. The tentacles were fragile and broke off easily, so an unpackaged figure with intact tentacles is rare. * Iron Man (James \\"Rhodey\\" Rhodes) - Comes with a laser pistol weapon. The character piloting the Iron Man suit in the Secret Wars comic and the short biography on the back of the packaging was listed as James \\"Rhodey\\" Rhodes. However Iron Man's lenticular \\"secret identity\\" insert depicted Tony Stark instead. * Kang the Conqueror - Comes with a laser pistol weapon. * Magneto - Comes with a laser pistol weapon. * Spider-Man (classic red-and-blue costume) * Wolverine - Comes with clip-on silver plastic claws. The variant version had clip-on black plastic claws because of complaints that Wolverine's razor-sharp claws looked like knives. Series 2 Poor sales of Series 1 cut back the North American release of this series to just five figures rather than eight. The remaining three were only released overseas. The back of the packaging card had the same character illustration, biography and 4-panel comic like the Series 1 figures but instead had pictures of Captain America, Doctor Doom, and Doctor Octopus from Series 1 and all five figures from Series 2. * Baron Zemo II (Helmut Zemo) - Comes with a black plastic \\"Genetic Blaster\\" laser pistol. * Daredevil - Comes with a black or silver plastic billy club. * Falcon - Comes with a perched brown plastic Redwing figure accessory and adjustable red plastic wings. * Hobgoblin - Comes with removable orange plastic cape and 3-piece purple plastic Goblin Glider. * Spider-Man (new black costume) Foreign releases These were originally planned to be part of Series 2 but were instead dumped in overseas markets. Packaging was in Spanish language text. * Constrictor - Comes with a silver plastic constrictor cable (rather than two).

Therefore, the lyrics never mention South Tyrol directly, referring instead to its geographical extension. In the first verse, its north-south extension is described by the way of the Eisack source and the Salurner Klause, a bottleneck which used to mark the border between the German and Italian-speaking area. The West-East extension is characterized by the mountain Ortler and the Sexten Dolomites.

She chased after them and found that one was holding a vegetable knife and the other a dagger. The men escaped, leaving Qian on the ground with a cut to his stomach. The two men attempted to cut Qian's hand before fleeing. Xiao Sanlang, who edits Qian's articles at Beijing News Daily, said the men had announced they were taking revenge. Qian was hospitalized after the incident. The bold assault stirred fears and a flurry of rumors.

Critical of this, he cast Judaism and the synagogues in his city in a critical and negative light. There are modern scholars who claim that an abuse of his preaching fed later Christian anti-Semitism, and some, such as Stephen Katz, go even further, saying it was an inspiration for pagan Nazi anti-semitism with its evil fruit of the programme to annihilate the Jewish race. Indeed, during World War II, the Nazi Party in Germany abused his homilies, quoting and reprinting them frequently in an attempt to legitimize the Holocaust in the eyes of German and Austrian Christians. Christian priest James Parkes called the writing on Jews \\"the most horrible and violent denunciations of Judaism to be found in the writings of a Christian theologian\\".James Parkes, Prelude to Dialogue (London: 1969) p. 153; cited in Wilken, p. xv. According to historian William I. Brustein, his sermons against Jews gave further momentum to the idea that Jews are collectively responsible for the death of Jesus.William I. Brustein, Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe before the Holocaust, (Cambridge University Press:2003) , p. 52. Purpose and context During his first two years as a presbyter in Antioch (386-387), Chrysostom denounced Jews and Judaizing Christians in a series of eight sermons delivered to Christians in the church of Antioch, who were taking part in Jewish festivals and other Jewish observances.See Wilken, p.xv, and also \\"John Chrysostom\\" in Encyclopedia Judaica It is disputed whether the main target were specifically Judaizers or Jews in general. His homilies were expressed in the conventional manner, utilizing the uncompromising rhetorical form known as the psogos (Greek: blame). One of the purposes of these homilies was to prevent Christians from participating in Jewish customs, and thus prevent the perceived erosion of Chrysostom's flock. In his sermons, Chrysostom criticized those \\"Judaizing Christians\\", who were participating in Jewish festivals and taking part in other Jewish observances, such as observing the sabbath, submitting to circumcision and pilgrimage to Jewish holy places.Wilken, p.xv. In Greek, the sermons are called Kata Ioudai≈çn (ŒöŒ±œÑ·Ω∞ ŒôŒøœÖŒ¥Œ±ŒØœâŒΩ), which is translated as Adversus Judaeos in Latin and Against the Jews in English.John Chrysostom, Discourses Against Judaizing Christians (vol. 68 of Fathers of the Church), trans. Paul W. Harkins (Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press, 1979) p.x The most recent scholarly translations, claiming that Chrysostom's primary targets were members of his own congregation who continued to observe the Jewish feasts and fasts, give the sermons the more sympathetic title Against Judaizing Christians.For example John Chrysostom, Discourses Against Judaizing Christians (vol. 68 of Fathers of the Church), trans. Paul W. Harkins (Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press, 1979); and also Anti-Semitism Chrysostom claimed that on the shabbats and Jewish festivals synagogues were full of Christians, especially women, who loved the solemnity of the Jewish liturgy, enjoyed listening to the shofar on Rosh Hashanah, and applauded famous preachers in accordance with the contemporary custom.\\"John Chrysostom\\" in Encyclopedia Judaica. A more recent apologetic theory is that he instead tried to persuade Jewish Christians, who for centuries had kept connections with Jews and Judaism, to choose between Judaism and Christianity.Rodney Stark, The Rise of Christianity. How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force in the Western World in a Few Centuries (Princeton University Press: 1997) p. 66-67. Chrysostom held Jews responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus and deicide (killing God, see \\"Jewish deicide\\" for the subject) and added that they continued to rejoice in Jesus's death.William I. Brustein, Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe before the Holocaust (Cambridge University Press:2003) , p.52. He compared the synagogue to a pagan temple, representing it as the source of all vices and heresies. He described it as a place worse than a brothel and a drinking shop; it was a den of scoundrels, the repair of wild beasts, a temple of demons, the refuge of brigands and debauchees, and the cavern of devils, a criminal assembly of the assassins of Christ.Walter Laqueur, The Changing Face of Antisemitism: From Ancient Times To The Present Day (Oxford University Press: 2006) , p. 47-48 Palladius, Chrysostom's contemporary biographer, also recorded his claim that among the Jews the priesthood may be purchased and sold for money. Finally, he declared that, in accordance with the sentiments of the saints, he hated both the synagogue and the Jews, saying that demons dwell in the synagogue and also in the souls of the Jews, and describing them as growing fit for slaughter.John Chrysostom, Against the Jews, 1:6 Historical recuperation The original Benedictine editor of the homilies, Bernard de Montfaucon, gives the following footnote to the title: \\"A discourse against the Jews; but it was delivered against those who were Judaizing and keeping the fasts with them [the Jews].\\"Chrysostom, Discourses Against Judaizing Christians, p.xxxi) As such, some have claimed that the original title misrepresents the contents of the discourses, which show that Chrysostom's primary targets were members of his own congregation who continued to observe the Jewish feasts and fasts. Sir Henry Savile, in his 1612 edition of Homilies 27 of Volume 6 (which is Discourse I in Patrologia Graeca's Adversus Iudaeos), gives the title: \\"Chrysostom's Discourse Against Those Who Are Judaizing and Observing Their Fasts.\\"Chrysostom, Discourses Against Judaizing Christians, p.xxxi). British historian Paul Johnson stated that Chrysostom's homilies \\"became the pattern for anti-Jewish tirades, making the fullest possible use (and misuse) of key passages in the gospels of Saints Matthew and John. Thus a specifically Christian anti-Semitism, presenting the Jews as murderers of Christ, was grafted on to the seething mass of pagan smears and rumours, and Jewish communities were now at risk in every Christian city.\\"Johnson, Paul, A History of the Jews, (HarperPerennial: 1988), p. 165. According to Patristics scholars, opposition to any particular view during the late fourth century was conventionally expressed in a manner, utilizing the rhetorical form known as the psogos, whose literary conventions were to vilify opponents in an uncompromising manner; thus, it has been argued that to call Chrysostom an \\"anti-Semite\\" is to employ anachronistic terminology in a way incongruous with historical context and record.Wilken, p. 124-126.  Chrysostom's homilies and Nazism  Some authors say John Chrysostom's preaching was an inspiration for Nazi anti-semitism with its evil fruit of the programme to annihilate the Jewish race. Steven Katz cites Chrysostom's homilies as ‚Äúthe decisive turn in the history of Christian anti-Judaism, a turn whose ultimate disfiguring consequence was enacted in the political antisemitism of Adolf Hitler.‚Äù During World War II, the Nazi Party in Germany used Chrysostom's work in an attempt to legitimize the Holocaust in the eyes of German and Austrian Christians. His works were frequently quoted and reprinted as a witness for the prosecution. After World War II, the Christian Churches denounced Nazi use of Chrysostom's works, explaining his words with reference to the historical context. According to Walter Laqueur, it was argued that in the 4th century, the general discourse was brutal and aggressive and that at the time when the Christian church was fighting for survival and recognition, mercy and forgiveness were not in demand. Other Adversus Iudaeos literature Other documents also form part of the Adversus Iudaeos literature.

Current models of innovation derive from approaches such as Actor-Network Theory, Social shaping of technology and social learning, provide a much richer picture of the way innovation works. Current ideas in Open Innovation and User innovation derive from these later ideas. In the 'Phase Gate Model' , the product or services concept is frozen at an early stage to minimize risk. Through enterprise, the innovation process involves a series of sequential phases arranged in a manner that the preceding phase muse be cleared before movie to the next phase. Therefore, a project must pass through a gate with the permission of the gatekeeper before moving to the next succeeding phase. Criteria for passing through each gate is defined beforehand. The gatekeeper examines whether the stated objectives for the preceding phase have been properly met or not and whether desired development has taken place during the preceding phase or not. Two versions of the linear model of innovation are often presented: # \\"technology push\\" model # \\"market pull\\" model From the 1950s to the Mid-1960s, the industrial innovation process was generally perceived as a linear progression from scientific discovery, through technological development in firms, to the marketplace. The stages of the \\"Technology Push\\" model are: :Basic science‚ÜíDesign and engineering‚ÜíManufacturing‚ÜíMarketing‚ÜíSales From the Mid 1960s to the Early 1970s, emerges the second-generation Innovation model, referred to as the \\"market pull\\" model of innovation. According to this simple sequential model, the market was the source of new ideas for directing R&D;, which had a reactive role in the process. The stages of the \\"market pull \\" model are: :Market need‚ÄîDevelopment‚ÄîManufacturing‚ÄîSales. The linear models of innovation supported numerous criticisms concerning the linearity of the models. These models ignore the many feedbacks and loops that occur between the different \\"stages\\" of the process. Shortcomings and failures that occur at various stages may lead to a reconsideration of earlier steps and this may result in an innovation.

Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, so it remains resistant to brute-force search attacks even with increasing computation power. The bcrypt function is the default password hash algorithm for OpenBSD and other systems including some Linux distributions such as SUSE Linux. There are implementations of bcrypt for C, C++, C#, Elixir, Go, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and other languages. Background Blowfish is notable among block ciphers for its expensive key setup phase. It starts off with subkeys in a standard state, then uses this state to perform a block encryption using part of the key, and uses the result of that encryption (which is more accurate at hashing) to replace some of the subkeys. Then it uses this modified state to encrypt another part of the key, and uses the result to replace more of the subkeys. It proceeds in this fashion, using a progressively modified state to hash the key and replace bits of state, until all subkeys have been set. Provos and Mazi√®res took advantage of this, and took it further. They developed a new key setup algorithm for Blowfish, dubbing the resulting cipher \\"Eksblowfish\\" (\\"expensive key schedule Blowfish\\"). The key setup begins with a modified form of the standard Blowfish key setup, in which both the salt and password are used to set all subkeys. There are then a number of rounds in which the standard Blowfish keying algorithm is applied, using alternatively the salt and the password as the key, each round starting with the subkey state from the previous round. In theory, this is no stronger than the standard Blowfish key schedule, but the number of rekeying rounds is configurable; this process can therefore be made arbitrarily slow, which helps deter brute-force attacks upon the hash or salt. Description A bcrypt hash string is of the form: $2b$[cost]$[22 character salt][31 character hash] For example: $2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy \\\\\\\\__/\\\\/ \\\\\\\\____________________/\\\\\\\\_____________________________/ Alg Cost Salt Hash Where: * \`$2a$\`: The hash algorithm identifier (bcrypt) * \`10\`: Cost factor (2\`10\` > 1,024 rounds) * \`N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMye\`: 16-byte (128-bit) salt, base64 encoded to 22 characters * \`IjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy\`: 24-byte (192-bit) hash, base64 encoded to 31 characters The prefix \\"$2a$\\" or \\"$2b$\\" (or \\"$2y$\\") in a hash string in a shadow password file indicates that hash string is a bcrypt hash in modular crypt format.passlib. \\"Modular Crypt Format\\". The rest of the hash string includes the cost parameter, a 128-bit salt (Radix-64 encoded as 22 characters), and 192 bits of the resulting hash value (Radix-64 encoded as 31 characters).passlib. \\"BCrypt\\". The Radix-64 encoding uses the unix/crypt alphabet, and is not 'standard' Base-64. The cost parameter specifies a key expansion iteration count as a power of two, which is an input to the crypt algorithm. For example, the shadow password record \`$2a$10$N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMyeIjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy\` specifies a cost parameter of 10, indicating 210 key expansion rounds. The salt is \`N9qo8uLOickgx2ZMRZoMye\` and the resulting hash is \`IjZAgcfl7p92ldGxad68LJZdL17lhWy\`. Per standard practice, the user's password itself is not stored.  Versioning history  $2$ (1999) The original Bcrypt specification defined a prefix of \`$2$\`. This follows the Modular Crypt Format format used when storing passwords in the OpenBSD password file: * \`$1$\`: MD5-based crypt ('md5crypt') * \`$2$\`: Blowfish-based crypt ('bcrypt') * \`$sha1$\`: SHA-1-based crypt ('sha1crypt') * \`$5$\`: SHA-256-based crypt ('sha256crypt') * \`$6$\`: SHA-512-based crypt ('sha512crypt') $2a$ The original specification did not define how to handle non-ASCII character, nor how to handle a null terminator. The specification was revised to specify that when hashing strings: * the string must be UTF-8 encoded * the null terminator must be included With this change, the version was changed to \`$2a$\` $2x$, $2y$ (June 2011) In June 2011, a bug was discovered in crypt_blowfish, a PHP implementation of BCrypt. It was mis-handling characters with the 8th bit set. They suggested that system administrators update their existing password database, replacing \`$2a$\` with \`$2x$\`, to indicate that those hashes are bad (and need to use the old broken algorithm). They also suggested the idea of having crypt_blowfish emit \`$2y$\` for hashes generated by the fixed algorithm. Nobody else, including canonical OpenBSD, adopted the idea of 2x/2y. This version marker change was limited to crypt_blowfish. $2b$ (February 2014) A bug was discovered in the OpenBSD implementation of bcrypt. They were storing the length of their strings in an unsigned char (i.e. 8-bit \`Byte\`). If a password was longer than 255 characters, it would overflow and wrap at 255. BCrypt was created for OpenBSD. When they had a bug in their library, they decided to bump the version number. Algorithm The bcrypt algorithm is the result of encrypting the text \\"OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt\\" 64 times using Blowfish. In bcrypt the usual Blowfish key setup function is replaced with an expensive key setup (EksBlowfishSetup) function: Function bcrypt Input: cost: Number (4..31) log2(Iterations). e.g. 12 > 212 = 4,096 iterations salt: array of Bytes (16 bytes) random salt password: array of Bytes (1..72 bytes) UTF-8 encoded password Output: hash: array of Bytes (24 bytes) //Initialize Blowfish state with expensive key setup algorithm //P: array of 18 subkeys (UInt32[18]) //S: Four substitution boxes (S-boxes), S0...S3. Each S-box is 1,024 bytes (UInt32[256]) P, S \\\\gets EksBlowfishSetup(cost, salt, password) //Repeatedly encrypt the text \\"OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt\\" 64 times ctext \\\\gets \\"OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt\\" //24 bytes > three 64-bit blocks repeat (64) ctext \\\\gets EncryptECB(P, S, ctext) //encrypt using standard Blowfish in ECB mode //24-byte ctext is resulting password hash return Concatenate(cost, salt, ctext)  Expensive key setup  The bcrypt algorithm depends heavily on its \\"Eksblowfish\\" key setup algorithm, which runs as follows: Function EksBlowfishSetup Input: password: array of Bytes (1..72 bytes) UTF-8 encoded password salt: array of Bytes (16 bytes) random salt cost: Number (4..31) log2(Iterations). e.g. 12 > 212 = 4,096 iterations Output: P: array of UInt32 array of 18 per-round subkeys S1..S4: array of UInt32 array of four SBoxes; each SBox is 256 UInt32 (i.e. 1024 KB) //Initialize P (Subkeys), and S (Substitution boxes) with the hex digits of pi P, S \\\\gets InitialState() //Permutate P and S based on the password and salt P, S \\\\gets ExpandKey(P, S, salt, password) //This is the \\"Expensive\\" part of the \\"Expensive Key Setup\\". //Otherwise the key setup is identical to Blowfish. repeat (2cost) P, S \\\\gets ExpandKey(P, S, 0, password) P, S \\\\gets ExpandKey(P, S, 0, salt) return P, S InitialState works as in the original Blowfish algorithm, populating the P-array and S-box entries with the fractional part of \\\\pi in hexadecimal.  Expand key  The ExpandKey function does the following: Function ExpandKey Input: password: array of Bytes (1..72 bytes) UTF-8 encoded password salt: Byte[16] random salt P: array of UInt32 Array of 18 subkeys S1..S4: UInt32[1024] Four 1 KB SBoxes Output: P: array of UInt32 Array of 18 per-round subkeys S1..S4: UInt32[1024] Four 1 KB SBoxes //Mix password into the P subkeys array for n \\\\gets 1 to 18 do Pn \\\\gets Pn xor password[32(n-1)..32n-1] //treat the password as cyclic //Treat the 128-bit salt as two 64-bit halves (the Blowfish block size). saltHalf[0] \\\\gets salt[0..63] //Lower 64-bits of salt saltHalf[1] \\\\gets salt[64..127] //Upper 64-bits of salt //Initialize an 8-byte (64-bit) buffer with all zeros. block \\\\gets 0 //Mix internal state into P-boxes for n \\\\gets 1 to 9 do //xor 64-bit block with a 64-bit salt half block \\\\gets block xor saltHalf[(n-1) mod 2] //each iteration alternating between saltHalf[0], and saltHalf[1] //encrypt block using current key schedule block \\\\gets Encrypt(P, S, block) P2n \\\\gets block[0..31] //lower 32-bits of block P2n+1 \\\\gets block[32..63] //upper 32-bits block //Mix encrypted state into the internal S-boxes of state for i \\\\gets 1 to 4 do for n \\\\gets 0 to 127 do block \\\\gets Encrypt(state, block xor salt[64(n-1)..64n-1]) //as above Si[2n] \\\\gets block[0..31] //lower 32-bits Si[2n+1] \\\\gets block[32..63] //upper 32-bits return state Hence, \`ExpandKey(state, 0, key)\` is the same as regular Blowfish key schedule since all XORs with the all-zero salt value are ineffectual. \`ExpandKey(state, 0, salt)\` is similar, but uses the salt as a 128-bit key. User input Many implementations of bcrypt truncate the password to the first 72 bytes, following the OpenBSD implementation. The mathematical algorithm itself requires initialization with 18 32-bit subkeys (equivalent to 72 octets/bytes). The original specification of bcrypt does not mandate any one particular method for mapping text-based passwords from userland into numeric values for the algorithm. One brief comment in the text mentions, but does not mandate, the possibility of simply using the ASCII encoded value of a character string: \\"Finally, the key argument is a secret encryption key, which can be a user-chosen password of up to 56 bytes (including a terminating zero byte when the key is an ASCII string).\\" Note that the quote above mentions passwords \\"up to 56 bytes\\" even though the algorithm itself makes use of a 72 byte initial value. Although Provos and Mazi√®res do not state the reason for the shorter restriction, they may have been motivated by the following statement from Bruce Schneier's original specification of Blowfish, \\"The 448 [bit] limit on the key size ensures that the every bit of every subkey depends on every bit of the key.\\" Implementations have varied in their approach of converting passwords into initial numeric values, including sometimes reducing the strength of passwords containing non-ASCII characters. And Criticisms Maximum password length BCrypt has a maximum password length of 72 bytes. This maximum comes from the first operation of the ExpandKey function that \`xor's\` the 18 4-byte subkeys (P) with the password: P1..P18 \\\\gets P1..P18 xor passwordBytes The password (which is UTF-8 encoded), is repeated until it is 72-bytes long. For example, a password of: \`correct horse battery staple‚êÄ\` (29 bytes) Is repeated until it matches the 72-bytes of the 18 P per- round subkeys: \`correct horse battery staple‚êÄcorrect horse battery staple‚êÄcorrect horse \` (72 bytes) This also means that if a password were longer than 72-bytes UTF-8 encoded: the password would be truncated. Some characters can require 4-bytes when UTF-8 encoded. This means that in the worst case, this can limit a password to 18 characters: \`êëúêëùêëüêë•êë∑êëªêëΩêëæêëøêëøêë∞êë©êëõêëôêëòêëôêëíêëî\` (18 characters, 72 bytes) This limit of 72-byte passwords (18 subkeys * 4-bytes each) could have been addressed in a number of ways: Solution 1 - Increase number of subkeys You can increase the number of P subkeys used, and therefore increase the maximum password length available. Bruce Schneier, the original author of Blowfish, noted that people could play with adding more rounds,https://www.schneier.com/academic/blowfish/ which requires more subkeys, which for bcrypt would increase the maximum password length. A downside of this is that there is still a maximum password length - rather than no maximum length. Solution 2 - Continue to xor mix the key bytes into the P subkeys array Password mixing only continues as long as P1...P18. Once you've reached P18 and you still have password bytes unprocessed, continue the xor process on P1. A downside of this approach is that the computation time leaks the password length (side-channel information leak) Solution 3 - Pre- hash password The long password can be pre-hashed with another cryptographic hashing function. This function always outputs a digest of a fixed size. As long as the resulting digest is less than 72 bytes: it can be fed into bcrypt without being cut off. This is the approach taken by DropBoxhttps://dropbox.tech/security/how-dropbox-securely-stores-your- passwords and others. For example, consider the password: \`‡®§‡©á‡®ú‡®º ‡®≠‡©Ç‡®∞‡©á ‡®≤‡©Ç‡©∞‡®¨‡©ú ‡®®‡©á ‡®Ü‡®≤‡®∏‡©Ä ‡®ï‡©Å‡©±‡®§‡©á ‡®â‡©±‡®§‡©á ‡®õ‡®æ‡®≤ ‡®Æ‡®æ‡®∞ ‡®¶‡®ø‡©±‡®§‡©Ä\` (32 characters, 126 bytes) If you hash that password using SHA-256, you get the 256-bit (32-byte) digest: A7 B2 AA 86 CB 57 D3 08 EA 54 9F 34 E5 91 7E 8C 06 9B D0 0D 34 28 B1 CA 8D 71 B2 2E 84 DA C0 F8 Base64 encoding the digest gives a string that is consistently 44 characters: \`p7KqhstX0wjqVJ805ZF+jAab0A00KLHKjXGyLoTawPg=\` (44 characters, 44 bytes) and will always fit in the 72-byte bcrypt limit. This is similar to an approach used by Pufferfish2, an cache-hard evolution of bcrypt, that uses HMACSHA-152 to convert the password into a fixed length 64-byte (512-bit) key. Password hash truncation The bcrypt algorithm involves repeatedly encrypting the 24-byte text: \`OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt\` (24-bytes) This generates 24-bytes of ciphertext, e.g.: \`85 20 af 9f 03 3d b3 8c 08 5f d2 5e 2d aa 5e 84 a2 b9 61 d2 f1 29 c9 a4\` (24-bytes) Which then should get radix-64 encoded to 32-characters: \`hSCvnwM9s4wIX9JeLapehKK5YdLxKcmk\` (32-characters) But the canonical OpenBSD implementation truncates password hash to 23 bytes: \`85 20 af 9f 03 3d b3 8c 08 5f d2 5e 2d aa 5e 84 a2 b9 61 d2 f1 29 c9\` ~~a4~~ (23-bytes) and the resulting base-64 encoded text, which normally would be: hSCvnwM9s4wIX9JeLapehKK5YdLxKck= has the trailing = removed, leaving a hash of: hSCvnwM9s4wIX9JeLapehKK5YdLxKck It is unclear why the canonical implementation deletes 8-bits from the resulting password hash. Usage of non-standard base64 encoding The base-64 encoding used by the canonical OpenBSD implementation uses a base-64 encoding dictionary that is different from those available in nearly every language and platform. The encoding is compatible with the crypt.https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-bcrypt-protocol- is-kind-of-a-mess-4aace5eb31bd This means the encoding is not compatible with RFC 4648.

It comprised both from Cham Albanians and Greeks, of the region of Epirus and was established in May 1944. However, according to some historians, during the World War II occupation the majority of the elites of the Cham community had become corrupted by the occupying forces and the atmosphere against the local Greeks who had suffered under Germans, Italians and Chams, led to an explosive polarization which would have constrained any motivation for joint Greek-Cham resistance. Background Following the Italian invasion of Albania, the Albanian Kingdom became a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy. The Italians used the Albanian minority in Greece, as an excuse to start the war. The final alibi was the alleged murder by Greek agents of a Cham Albanian leader. Although fascist Italy was defeated in the Greco-Italian War, a rapid German Blitzkrieg campaign followed in April 1941, and by the middle of May, Greece was under joint occupation by three Axis powers: Germany, Italy and Bulgaria.

One of the major resistance groups in Greece was the communist-led National Liberation Front (EAM), with its armed branch, the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), founded on 27 September 1941.Mark Mazower (2001). Inside Hitler's Greece - The Experience of Occupation, 1941-44. United States: Yale University Press. . EAM evolved into the largest resistance group and the largest mass movement seen until then in Greece. ELAS initiated actions against the German and Italian forces of occupation in Greece on 7 June 1942 and it would become the resistance group in which Cham Albanians would found their battalion. Cham Albanians had been fighting the occupiers in unorganized small groups, under the lead of the National Anti-Fascist Liberation Army of Albania (NAFLA), which was created in September 1942, as the armed wing of the National Liberation Movement (NLM), inspired by the Communist Party of Albania. Later these Chams would create the \\"Chameria\\" battalion, under the Albanian Army.Anamali, Sk√´nder and Prifti, Kristaq. Historia e popullit shqiptar n√´ kat√´r v√´llime. Botimet Toena, 2002, . Formation At the end of 1943, a group of Cham Albanians, led by Ali Demi, attacked a German garrison, in Vlora, Albania, killing 39 German troops and losing 12 members of the battalion, including Ali Demi himself. At this time, Greek People's Liberation Army, asked Cham Albanians living in Greece to create a battalion and to enlist in its ranks. Having a good relation with the Albanian Army, ELAS's and NAFLA's officers managed to persuade Chams to create armed forces under the ELAS army. In May 1944, a group of local Cham Albanians, created the battalion named after Ali Demi, in the village Milea (), which was included in the 15th regiment of Greek People's Liberation Army. The battalion consisted of 460 partisans and included Cham Albanians, Orthodox Albanians and Greeks from the Greek minority of Albania. Participation in the war Being formed at the end of the war, the battalion had no significant contribution in fighting the occupation forces. Other Cham Albanians were enlisted in VI, VII, IX and XI brigade of Greek People's Liberation Army, and fought in different mixed battalions of ELAS. After ELAS managed to enter Epirus, the battles of the battalion were against EDES, led by Napoleon Zervas. The majority of battles occurred until 27 June 1944, when EDES forces started the ethnic cleansing of the region. Aftermath In an attempt to establish an ethnically pure border region, the Chams were evicted from northern Greece by guerrilla forces under the command of General Napoleon Zervas acting under the instructions of allied officers.Vickers, Miranda. The Cham Issue - Albanian National & Property Claims in Greece . Paper prepared for the British MoD, Defence Academy, 2002. Two attacks took place in July and August with the participation of EDES Tenth Division and the local Greek peasants, eager to gain revenge for the burning of their own homes. According to Cham testimonies, which are unconfirmed by Western reports, a major massacre of Albanian Muslims by Greek irregulars occurred on 27 June 1944 in the district of Paramythia, when this forces entered the town and killed approximately 600 Muslim Chams, men, women and children. When ELAS briefly gained control of the Thesprotia region in late 1944, about four to five thousand Albanians returned to their homes. But after the Varkiza Agreement, EDES forces again expelled them, killing about 300 Muslim Cham Albanians in the process, while Orthodox Chams were allowed to stay in Greece. This region, as others in Northern Greece, became the heart of the Greek Civil War between the communist ELAS and the anti-communist forces of EDES and the Greek government, backed by the British allies.

It was once mined for lime ('Cal' in portuguese). It's extraction led to several accidents, one of which killed sixteen workers, victims of a mine collapse. The mines are no longer active, but remnants of it are still intact and can be visited with a proper license and specialized escort. The construction of a cable car was planned to connect the tip of Calheta (in Porto Santo) to the islet, however, the project was abandoned because it constituted a threat to the islet's fragile ecosystem, which with the permanent arrival of a large number of visitors would represent a danger to its regeneration. Ecological Preservation Side view of the Island seen from a beach in Porto Santo Despite of its rough apearance, this islet is home to a very rich flora, which includes the usual coastal shrubs and some traces of laurisilva, probably due to its difficult access. It is also a breeding ground for at least four species of birds, the Atlantic canary, the Berthelot's pipit, the plain swift and the little shearwater and home to endemic land snails, Amphorella cimensis and Leiostyla relevata. For these reasons, its ecosystem is protected by the portuguese PDM and Rede Natura 2000.

He also worked on houses and housing schemes for local authorities and businesses. At the same time he taught in various capacities concerning planning and public design, including work at the AA School and Cambridge University. In 1956 Voelcker collaborated with Richard Hamilton and John McHale on the seminal This is Tomorrow exhibition, for which Voelcker designed the structure of their part of the exhibition. In 1958 a dispute with local planning authorities over a building designed for the jazz musician Humphrey Lyttelton led to Voelcker and Lyttelton successfully challenging the authorities. The building was a dramatic U-shaped structure and included a \\"splendidly witty\\" pop art mural by McHale. As a result of their defence of creative architecture Voelcker and Lyttelton were named the Architect's Journal's men of the year. In 1965 he became director of Senior Studies at the AA School.

Born in Turin, Italy, he attended the Albertina Academy of Fine Arts before travelling to Bangkok, where he was one of many Westerners employed by the Siamese government. He made significant career progress through the court of King Vajiravudh, but left government office to work privately as the country was going through political change which abolished absolute monarchy and decreased government employment of foreigners. However, by adopting a Thai identity and way of life, marrying a Thai woman and settling down permanently, Manfredi remained a relevant and respected figure in Thai architecture, and later became a lecturer at Chulalongkorn University. His works include various royal residences and public institutions, ranging in style from Venetian Gothic to modernist, and incorporated Thai traditional styles as well. He contributed to much of Bangkok's architectural heritage, but no complete records of his works were kept. Early life Ercole Pietro Manfredi was born on 2 July 1883 in Turin, Italy to Luigi Manfredi and Caterina Bo. He attended the Lagrange Royal Technical School starting in 1894 and the San Carlo Technical School from 1898 to 1899. At the age of sixteen, he was admitted into the Albertina Academy of Fine Arts, where during his studies he received a first prize in architecture, design, perspective and painting. He received a diploma in 1907 and subsequently attended the Higher Course in Architecture. During this time he also worked for Turin's Public and Municipal Works Department, where he supervised constructions and patented an earthquake engineering system. In 1909, he graduated with a High Qualification as painter and architect, receiving a gold medal first prize in addition to fifteen other prizes won during his studies.Bressan, pp. 1‚Äì2 Career In 1909, Manfredi was selected by the academy to fill an architect position for the government of Siam (now Thailand). Sailing from Genoa, he arrived in Bangkok on 1 December. He was placed under the Architectural Section of the Ministry of Public Works working under engineer-in-chief Carlo Allegri and Minister Prince Naresra Varariddhi. He collaborated with many Italian architects employed by the government including Mario Tamagno, who was the department's chief architect, and others who were involved in the construction of Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall. Many of these architects were in fact also from Turin or alumni of Albertina.Bressan, p. 2 In 1912, Manfredi was promoted to a position in the Ministry of the Royal Household, where he worked closely with King Vajiravudh and Prince Narisara Nuvadtivongs. He was subsequently promoted to Chief Architect and third court officer in 1917 and first court officer in 1921. In 1920, he was appointed the post of naval architect, with the rank of lieutenant-commander in the Royal Naval Scout Corps, which was the king's private battalion in the Wild Tiger Corps para-military movement. He later became Chief Architect of the Archaeological Section of the Royal Institute in 1926. During his service to the government, he was decorated with the Order of the Crown of Siam (commander, 1913), the Dushdi Mala Medal for artistic merit (1915), and the Order of the White Elephant (commander, 1920). He was also awarded the gold medal prize at the Bangkok Fine Arts Exhibition in 1917.Bressan, pp. 3‚Äì4 In 1930, during the period of political turmoil leading up to the abolition of absolute monarchy in the Siamese Revolution of 1932, Manfredi retired from government office. For a while, he pursued archaeological studies as an assistant to the French archaeologist George Coedes. He then continued his work as architect privately cooperating with Christiani & Nielsen (Siam) Ltd. from 1934 to 1936 and the Impresitor Company from 1937 to 1938.Bressan, p. 4Noobanjong, p. 354 In 1939, Manfredi became a lecturer at the Faculty of Architecture of Chulalongkorn University, where he taught for eight years. He also served as a lecturer in the Signalling Division of the Royal Thai Navy from 1944 to 1950 before retiring from public life.Bressan, p. 3 Personal life In Siam, Manfredi adopted the local culture and way of life. He dressed and ate like a Thai, mingled with Thai friends, and used an abacus to calculate. His government contract had required him \\"to be able within one year to converse in Siamese in a tolerable way,\\" but he went further and became fluent in both the spoken and written language.De Lazara et al, pp. 119‚Äì120 Manfredi married a Thai wife, Thongmuan (), with Buddhist rites in 1913. They had two daughters and lived together in what he described as \\"years of paradise\\". He left the country only twice, in 1925 and 1928, to represent Siam at the second and third International Book Fairs in Florence. Following the revolution of 1932, rising nationalistic sentiments resulted in a large decline in the role and numbers of Westerners working for the government. Manfredi was among the few who remained in Thailand. Like Corrado Feroci, he took up a Thai name, Ekkarit Manfendi (), and received Thai nationality on 29 November 1943. By adopting a Thai identity, he remained a relevant and respected figure in the Thai field of architecture.Noobanjong, pp. 247‚Äì249 Manfredi was involved in various humanitarian and cultural organisations. He was a member of the Siam and the Italian Red Cross, the Siam Teachers' Association, the Automobile Club of Siam, and the Alliance fran√ßaise. He also maintained links with his Italian roots, and was a member in the Dante Alighieri Society, the Colonial Italian Institute, and the Italian Touring Club. He was also selected as a correspondent member of the Italian Book Institute of Florence in 1929. Manfredi has been described as rather eccentric for a foreigner in Siam at the time. In an interview, his daughter Maly Manfredi remarked that he was \\"an odd number\\".De Lazara et al, pp. 117 He was also noted to be impulsive and stubborn, often ignoring his wife's sensible advice to do what he wanted, including leaving his official post to pursue archaeology. According to Maly, \\"as court architect, he used to fly into a rage at the suppliers' gifts,\\" and \\"Papa needed a big organisation to discipline him, like the Court or Chulalongkorn University.\\"De Lazara et al, pp. 117, 121‚Äì122 At the age of seventy-five, Manfredi realised his dream project of building a boat; to finance, he had to sell his entire collection of Siamese art. He named the boat Mammino, and used it mostly for pleasure cruises to Pattaya.Bressan, p. 9De Lazara et al, pp. 117‚Äì118 Manfredi lived in Thailand until his death on 9 June 1973. He and his wife (who died six years later) were interred at the Christian cemetery at Ban Pong, Ratchaburi.Bressan, p. 5 Works Mrigadayavan Palace Manfredi contributed to much of Bangkok's architecture and also produced works of painting and sculpture. However, he did not keep a record of his contributions, and his employment by the government means that many of his designs were not attributed. He also produced architectural works during his time in Turin, but his work during the brief period make up only a minority of his accomplishments. Architecture Manfredi's architectural works involve both Thai and Western designs, which he adapted and developed to suit the local tradition. The more notable of these consist of royal palaces and villas; he also designed buildings for various public institutions. Upon his arrival in Bangkok in 1909, Manfredi collaborated with other Italian architects in the construction of Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, which had begun in 1908 and lasted until 1915. Manfredi was mainly responsible for the dome and the roof of the building, which was designed in the Italian Renaissance and neoclassical styles and modelled in part after the Basilica of Superga. \\"Much of that copper covering the Hall, I put on with my own hands,\\" he said in an interview with the Bangkok Post in 1967. He also contributed to the decorations and was responsible for later work on the building's foundations.Bressan, pp. 1, 6De Lazara et al, p. 122 Thai Khu Fa Building of the Government House, formerly Villa Norasingh He acted as chief architect for Mrigadayavan Palace in Cha-am and was in charge of its construction, which took place from 1923 to 1924. Designs for the seaside villa were sketched by King Vajiravudh and implemented by Manfredi. The palace consists of sixteen buildings and incorporates the Thai manner of elevated buildings with Western style and details.Bressan, p. 6Noobanjong, pp. 218‚Äì220 He also contributed to the design and construction of Villa Norasingh (1923‚Äì25), now the Thai Khu Fa Building of the Government House, although it is not officially attributed to him. The building was constructed mainly in the Venetian Gothic style and has a fa√ßade resembling that of Venice's Ca' d'Oro. He was not satisfied with the results, saying in a 1967 interview, \\"I built it in the Venetian style because I thought that Bangkok was the Venice of the East. Now I am so ashamed of it. It is not just right for this climate.\\"Bressan, p. 7 Manfredi produced many modernist designs in the 1930s. These include Manfredi Residence (1935) and Asawin Villa (c.1930s), which were influenced by the Bauhaus school and are among the first modernist buildings in Thailand. The decade saw widespread adoption of the International style for public and educational institutions. Among these are Manfredi's designs for the Rajvithi School of Nursing (c.1930s) and the Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Dentistry (1939).Noobanjong, pp. 361‚Äì362 Influences by the neoplastic (De Stijl) movement are seen in his designs for Triam Udom Suksa School (1934).Noobanjong, p. 362 He also designed Chulalongkorn University's Faculty of Fine Arts building, as well as the Chemistry and Physics buildings of the Faculty of Science. Building 1, Triam Udom Suksa School Other contributions by Manfredi include:Bressan, pp. 6‚Äì7 * Chakrabongse House (1909‚Äì1910), the residence of Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath on Maha Rat Road (with later contributions by Edward Healey) * Maliwan Mansion (1917), the residence of Prince Naresra Varariddhi, currently the FAO's regional office * Pibultham Villa (c.1920) the residence of M.R.

Sculpture Statue of Jarlet at Sanam Chandra Palace Manfredi did not specialise in sculpture, but two such works by him are known. They are the marble guardian lions at Wat Benchamabophit and the statue of Jarlet, King Vajiravudh's beloved dog, at Sanam Chandra Palace. Painting Having focused on painting early in his studies, Manfredi produced many visual works but was not well known for them. Most of his paintings have been dispersed; he sometimes gave them freely to friends and sold most of his possessions late in life. His known painted works include the following:Bressan, p. 8 * Contributions to the interior decoration of the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall; Most of the work was done by Galileo Chini. * Interior wall and ceiling designs (1912), which were presented to King Vajiravudh * Interior of the Borom Phiman Hall (1917), in cooperation with Prince Narisara Nuvadtivongs and Carlo Rigoli * Portraits on ivory of King Vajiravudh and the Queen, part of a collection of miniature portraits on ivory * Watercolour of the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall (8 January 1920); This was probably a present to King Vajiravudh, and is currently displayed in the Sukhothai Palace. Other works Manfredi designed scenes and costumes to be used in King Vajiravudh's theatrical plays, most notably that of the king's Thai adaptation of The Merchant of Venice. He did not limit his contributions to the arts, but also worked on engineering projects. He improved on the mechanics involved in the royal funeral procession and was particularly interested in developing an irrigation system for the country. References Bibliography * . * . * .

The Archive contains the most comprehensive collection of material in Ireland relating to homosexuality in particular and LGBT studies in general. There are some quarter-million press cuttings from the late 1960s onwards, a library of several hundred international titles (the earliest, a US title, dates from 1951), a complete set of every lesbian/gay title (periodicals and single issues) published since 1974 on the island of Ireland, and a collection of audiovisual material, photographs and slides, flyers, posters, badges and other ephemera. Among the private papers and organisational records are the archives of Alternative Miss Ireland, the Dublin Lesbian & Gay Film Festival GAZE, National LGBT Federation, IGRM, Gay Health Action, GLEN, Lesbians Organising Together (LOT), Dublin LGBTQ+ Pride Festival, and Gay Community News (GCN]. The Irish Queer Archive ‚Äì a vast collection of material which provides insights into the social, cultural and political history of the LGBT communities in an Irish and international context during the latter half of the 20th century ‚Äì was presented in 2008 to the National Library of Ireland following a decision to donate it by the National LGBT Federation. IQA is a living archive and continues to accept donations and deposits. Background Post Stonewall ‚Äò69, Irish lesbian and gay groups and individual activists have laboured to document their history; a history that ultimately touches on all of Irish life in the 20th century. Well-preserved yet incomplete records bear witness to the nascent lesbian and gay civil rights era of the early 1970s. Organisations like the Northern Irish Gay Rights Association (NIGRA), Irish Gay Rights Movement (IGRM) and the National LGBT Federation (NXF) maintained a tradition of preservation with keen foresight, often at considerable expense and with limited human resources. As one of the largest, oldest and continuous lesbian/gay corporate organisations in Ireland, NXF has been to the forefront of maintaining some semblance of an archive. From the late ‚Äò70s onwards this was confined to a rudimentary press clippings service and some limited research by, amongst others, activists Edmund Lynch, David Norris and Tom McClean. Like many organisations, NXF also managed to acquire or subsume the interests and records of other smaller, often more specialised, groups. One example of this is the entire archive of Out, Ireland's first commercial monthly gay magazine (1984-1988). The Out holding typically includes proofed manuscripts, original artwork, administrative and financial files, photographs, illustrations and file copies. From 1980 onwards a larger group of people in NXF helped maintain and preserve documents and cuttings. NXF capitalised on years of acquisition by holding onto a huge number of international titles that were surplus to ILGA‚Äôs requirements when the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) moved its information secretariat from Dublin to Stockholm in 1982. This collection constitutes the bedrock of the archive's library of international titles dating back to 1951. The archive and reference library was put on a more organised footing in Midsummer 1997 when NXF and GCN moved into new premises on South William Street, Dublin. At that point, civil rights activist Tonie Walsh, along with librarians Linda Forry and Plunkett Conroy, began a systematic re-organisation of its holdings. A limited public office was set up in a short time, facilitating researchers, students and historians, in addition to servicing the research needs of journalists at Gay Community News. Although it struggled financially in the following years with finding suitable, affordable office and storage accommodation, NXF lost no time in appointing a group of academics, historians and writers to focus on exploiting the collections and making suggestions for a future safe home. This IQA group consisted of Dr Eibhear Walshe, lecturer in English at UCC; Dr. Mary McAuliffe and Dr. Katherine O‚ÄôDonnell, both of Gender Studies at UCD; Susan O'Brien, Joan Murphy, an RT√â archivist; librarian Elizabeth Kirwan of NLI; and Tonie Walsh, coincidentally a former president of NXF and founding editor of Gay Community News (GCN). Extensive overtures and negotiations with Gerry Lyne (since retired) of the Department of Manuscripts at the National Library of Ireland ultimately bore fruit when it was agreed in 2008 to transfer the collections to NLI. The historic transfer of IQA to NLI was also hugely symbolic as it signalled the Irish state taking ownership of LGBT heritage. However, given the size of the archive, much work needs to be done in the filing, cataloguing and ultimately digitising of the entire collection. IQA holdings that have been made accessible are described as Manuscripts Collection List No. 151. Further information may be gleaned from the National Library of Ireland website: www.nli.ie. An advisory group, composed of many of the above- mentioned individuals, continues to focus on opportunities to help the National Library of Ireland exploit its collection. Regular cultural updates are featured on its Facebook page: www.facebook.com/IrishQueerArchive and on Instagram.

Roads At long, Kentucky Route 80 is the longest route in Kentucky, pictured here west of Somerset. Kentucky is served by six major interstate highways (I-24, I-64, I-65, I-69, I-71, I-75), seven parkways, and six bypasses and spurs. The parkways were originally toll roads, but on November 22, 2006, Governor Ernie Fletcher ended the toll charges on the William H. Natcher Parkway and the Audubon Parkway, the last two parkways in Kentucky to charge tolls for access. The related toll booths have been demolished. Ending the tolls some seven months ahead of schedule was generally agreed to have been a positive economic development for transportation in Kentucky. In June 2007, a law went into effect raising the speed limit on rural portions of Kentucky Interstates from to . Road tunnels include the interstate Cumberland Gap Tunnel and the rural Nada Tunnel. Greyhound provides bus service to most major towns in the state. Rail High Bridge over the Kentucky River was the tallest rail bridge in the world when it was completed in 1877. *Ashland, Kentucky (Amtrak station) *South Portsmouth-South Shore (Amtrak station) *Fulton (Amtrak station) Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Ashland, South Portsmouth and Fulton, Kentucky. The Cardinal, Trains 50 and 51, is the line that offers Amtrak service to Ashland and South Portsmouth. Amtrak Trains 58 and 59, the City of New Orleans, serve Fulton. The Northern Kentucky area, is served by the Cardinal at the Cincinnati Union Terminal. The terminal is just across the Ohio River in Cincinnati. As of 2004, there were approximately 2,640 miles (4,250.4 km) of railways in Kentucky, with about 65% of those being operated by CSX Transportation. Coal was by far the most common cargo, accounting for 76% of cargo loaded and 61% of cargo delivered. Also, Norfolk Southern's main north-south line runs through central and southern Kentucky, starting in Cincinnati. Formerly the CNO&TP; subsidiary of Southern Railway, it is NS's most profitable line. Bardstown features a tourist attraction known as My Old Kentucky Dinner Train. Run along a stretch of rail purchased from CSX in 1987, guests are served a four-course meal as they make a two-and-a-half-hour round-trip between Bardstown and Limestone Springs. The Kentucky Railway Museum is located in nearby New Haven. Other areas in Kentucky are reclaiming old railways in rail trail projects. One such project is Louisville's Big Four Bridge. If completed, the Big Four Bridge rail trail will contain the second longest pedestrian-only bridge in the world. The longest pedestrian-only bridge is also found in Kentucky ‚Äî the Newport Southbank Bridge, popularly known as the \\"Purple People Bridge\\", connecting Newport to Cincinnati, Ohio. Air Kentucky's primary airports include Louisville International Airport (Standiford Field), Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, and Blue Grass Airport in Lexington. Louisville International Airport is home to UPS's Worldport, its international air-sorting hub. There are also a number of regional airports scattered across the state. On August 27, 2006, Kentucky's Blue Grass Airport in Lexington was the site of a crash that killed 47 passengers and 2 crew members aboard a Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet designated Comair Flight 191, or Delta Air Lines Flight 5191, sometimes mistakenly identified by the press as Comair Flight 5191.Crash Kills 49 The lone survivor was the flight's first officer, James Polehinke, who doctors determined to be brain damaged and unable to recall the crash at all. Water A barge hauling coal in the Louisville and Portland Canal, the only manmade section of the Ohio River Being bounded by the two largest rivers in North America, water transportation has historically played a major role in Kentucky's economy. Most barge traffic on Kentucky waterways consists of coal that is shipped from both the Eastern and Western Coalfields, about half of which is used locally to power many power plants located directly off the Ohio River, with the rest being exported to other countries, most notably Japan. Many of the largest ports in the United States are located in or adjacent to Kentucky, including: *Port of Huntington-Tristate (includes Ashland, KY), largest inland port and 9th largest overall *Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky, 5th largest inland port and 43rd overall *Louisville-Southern Indiana, 7th largest inland port and 55th overall As a state, Kentucky ranks 10th overall in port tonnage.Top 20 Inland U.S. Ports for 2003 CY 2001 Tonnage for Selected U.S. Ports by Port Tons The only natural obstacle along the entire length of the Ohio River was the Falls of the Ohio, located just west of Downtown Louisville.

He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the 11th round of the 1975 NFL Draft. He played high school football at Notre Dame High School in Riverside, California and college football at USC, where he also played shortstop on the baseball team. With USC, Cobb played on 2 College World Series champion baseball teams (1973 and 1974) and 2 National Champion football teams (1972 and 1974). Cobb played 5 seasons for the Bengals, from 1975 to 1979. During those five years he played in 71 games, starting 54 and making 13 interceptions, playing as both a free safety and strong safety. He also served as a kick returner occasionally, returning five punts and one kickoff between 1975 and 1977. In 1977, he also got to play a little on offense. In a game against the San Diego Chargers on October 2, Cobb threw an incomplete pass. In a Monday Night Football game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on October 17, Cobb got one rushing attempt but did not gain any yardage. Cobb also played for the Steelers and Minnesota Vikings, splitting eight games between the two teams in 1980. He also served as a kick returner for the Steelers. In 1986, Cobb became an assistant athletic director at USC. Cobb was outspoken about the fact that black athletes at USC were graduating at a lower rate than white students and he did not see anything being done to assist those students. After Cobb was denied a promotion in 1990 or 1991, he sued the university for racial discrimination and breach of contract, saying that the university denied the promotion because his advocacy for its black athletes. USC was represented by Johnnie Cochran, who later represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial and in a turn of events similar to an issue in that trial, it was revealed that some USC employees had suggested framing Cobb for a fake drug bust. Cobb was eventually awarded $1.1 million. Cobb has also been active in raising awareness of the impact football injuries can have on players later in life. He has also been active in attempting to increase pension and medical benefits for former players. He became a director of the Independent Retired Players Summit. He is also president of the Retired NFL Players Congress.

Although Kentucky's culture is generally considered to be Southern, it is unique in that it is also influenced by the Midwest and Southern Appalachia in certain areas of the state. The state is known for bourbon and whiskey distilling, tobacco, horse racing, and college basketball. Kentucky is more similar to the Upper South in terms of ancestry which is predominantly American (meaning that only this ancestry was specified by respondents to the US Census). Nevertheless, during the 19th century, Kentucky did receive a substantial number of German immigrants, who settled mostly in the Midwest, along the Ohio river primarily in Louisville, Covington, and Newport. Only Maryland, Delaware, and West Virginia have higher German ancestry percentages than Kentucky among Census-defined Southern states, although Kentucky's percentage is closer to Virginia's than the previously named state's percentages. Kentucky was a slave state, and blacks once comprised over one- quarter of its population. However, it lacked the cotton plantation system and never had the same high percentage of African Americans as most other slave states, with less than 8% of its current population being black, Kentucky has a relatively significant rural African American population in the Central and Western areas of the state. Kentucky adopted the Jim Crow system of racial segregation in most public spheres after the Civil War, but the state never disenfranchised African American citizens to the level of the Deep South states, and it peacefully integrated its schools after the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education verdict, later adopting the first state civil rights act in the South in 1966. The biggest day in horse racing, the Kentucky Derby, is preceded by the two-week Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville. Louisville also plays host to the Kentucky State Fair and the Kentucky Shakespeare Festival. Owensboro, Kentucky's fourth largest city, gives credence to its nickname of \\"Barbecue Capital of the World\\" by hosting the annual International Bar-B-Q Festival. Bowling Green, Kentucky's third largest city and home to the only assembly plant in the world that manufactures the Chevrolet Corvette, opened the National Corvette Museum in 1994. Old Louisville, the largest historic preservation district in the United States featuring Victorian architecture and the third largest overall, hosts the St. James Court Art Show, the largest outdoor art show in the United States. The neighborhood was also home to the Southern Exposition (1883‚Äì1887), which featured the first public display of Thomas Edison's light bulb, and was the setting of Alice Hegan Rice's novel, Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch and Fontaine Fox's comic strip, the \\"Toonerville Trolley. The more rural communities are not without traditions of their own, however. Hodgenville, the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln, hosts the annual Lincoln Days Celebration, and will also host the kick-off for the National Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Celebration in February 2008. Bardstown celebrates its heritage as a major bourbon-producing region with the Kentucky Bourbon Festival. (Legend holds that Baptist minister Elijah Craig invented bourbon with his black slave in Georgetown, but some dispute this claim.) Glasgow mimics Glasgow, Scotland by hosting the Glasgow Highland Games, its own version of the Highland Games, and Sturgis hosts \\"Little Sturgis\\", a mini version of Sturgis, South Dakota's annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The residents of tiny Benton even pay tribute to their favorite tuber, the sweet potato, by hosting Tater Day. Residents of Clarkson in Grayson County celebrate their city's ties to the honey industry by celebrating the Clarkson Honeyfest. The Clarkson Honeyfest is held the last Thursday, Friday and Saturday in September, and is the \\"Official State Honey Festival of Kentucky.\\" Music Renfro Valley, Kentucky is home to Renfro Valley Entertainment Center and the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame and is known as \\"Kentucky's Country Music Capital,\\" a designation given it by the Kentucky State Legislature in the late 1980s. The Renfro Valley Barn Dance was where Renfro Valley's musical heritage began, in 1939, and influential country music luminaries like Red Foley, Homer & Jethro, Lily May Ledford & the Original Coon Creek Girls, Martha Carson, and many others have performed as regular members of the shows there over the years. The Renfro Valley Gatherin' is today America's second oldest continually broadcast radio program of any kind. It is broadcast on local radio station WRVK and a syndicated network of nearly 200 other stations across the United States and Canada every week. Contemporary Christian music star Steven Curtis Chapman is a Paducah native, and Rock and Roll Hall of Famers The Everly Brothers are closely connected with Muhlenberg County, where older brother Don was born. Kentucky was also home to Mildred and Patty Hill, the Louisville sisters credited with composing the tune to the ditty Happy Birthday to You in 1893; Loretta Lynn (Johnson County), and Billy Ray Cyrus (Flatwoods). However, its depth lies in its signature sound ‚Äî Bluegrass music. Bill Monroe, \\"The Father of Bluegrass\\", was born in the small Ohio County town of Rosine, while Ricky Skaggs, Keith Whitley, David \\"Stringbean\\" Akeman, Louis Marshall \\"Grandpa\\" Jones, Sonny and Bobby Osborne, and Sam Bush (who has been compared to Monroe) all hail from Kentucky. The International Bluegrass Music Museum is located in Owensboro, while the annual Festival of the Bluegrass is held in Lexington. Kentucky is also home to famed jazz musician and pioneer, Lionel Hampton (although this has been disputed in recent years). Blues legend W.C. Handy and R&B; singer Wilson Pickett also spent considerable time in Kentucky. The pop bands Midnight Star and Nappy Roots were both formed in Kentucky, as were country acts The Kentucky Headhunters, Montgomery Gentry and Halfway to Hazard, as well as Dove Award-winning Christian groups Audio Adrenaline (rock) and Bride (metal). Cuisine The Hot Brown was first served at Louisville's Brown Hotel Kentucky's cuisine is generally similar to traditional southern cooking. Although in some areas of the state it can blend elements of both the South and Midwest. One original Kentucky dish is called the Hot Brown, a dish normally layered in this order: toast, turkey, bacon, tomatoes and topped with mornay sauce. It was developed at the Brown Hotel in Louisville. The Pendennis Club in Louisville is the birthplace of the Old Fashioned cocktail. Also, western Kentucky is known for its own regional style of barbecue.

The series starred Aham Sharma, Yami Gautam and Zalak Thakker.  Plot  Chand Ke Paar Chalo starts with Anisa, a happy-go-lucky, lower middle class Muslim girl living in Lucknow with her parents. Initially, the story depicts Anisa's life in college, where she struggles to make a place for herself among the rich and well-connected students. She falls in love with a handsome and aristocratic young man, but backs off when she learns about his love for another girl. Selflessly, Anisa helps him to win the heart of his lady love. Then Anisa and her parents migrate to Mumbai. They go there primarily because Anisa's father requires treatment and the big city will provide better facilities. Anisa wants to get a job. She feels that opportunities in Mumbai are far greater than in Lucknow, and she doesn't want her ill and weak father to have to struggle to provide for them in Lucknow. For her, Lucknow does not hold any charm. Anisa, after much struggle, procures a job in one of Mumbai's biggest media houses -- The Singhanias -- who are the owners of a popular magazine: Desi Girls. She is hired by Arjun Singhania, the head honcho of this business empire, as his younger brother Rahul's personal assistant. Arjun is tired of Rahul's philandering ways, which are likely to ruin a big merger he is planning with Rahul's fianc√©e's family. Arjun is convinced that Anisa is exactly the kind of girl whom Rahul will never dream of flirting with. Rahul, on the other hand, is appalled that he is saddled with a girl like Anisa, who, for him, is a social embarrassment. The story now is of Anisa trying to fit into this new world of glitz and glamour: a world where every girl is a size zero, where every man is flirtatious, where money talks and style defines one's worth. Anisa is thrown into a world where everyone looks down on her and treats her with disdain. It is the story of her struggle to make a place for herself and find happiness, love, and a unique identity.

The General Assembly itself was first organized in 1619, when the colony was owned and administered by the London Company. Twenty-two burgesses were elected to that Assembly, two each from eleven designated settlement areas in the colony. The Assembly formed a unicameral legislature made up of the burgesses and the appointed members of the Governor's Council, presided over by the Governor, George Yeardley. Yeardley designated his secretary, John Pory, a council member, as Speaker of the General Assembly. Pory, however, appears to have acted only as secretary of the Assembly.Kukla, pp. 7‚Äì10. The General (or Grand) Assembly met seventeen more times from that first session through 1642. Its legal standing was put in doubt when the London Company was dissolved in May 1624 and Virginia came under the direct administration of the Crown.Kukla, pp. 10‚Äì12. A crisis developed in the spring of 1635 when an unpopular governor, Sir John Harvey, was arrested and deported to England by his own Council. This led to the February 1639 reappointment of former Governor Sir Francis Wyatt. Wyatt's instructions acknowledged the legal status of the General Assembly and of land titles granted by the London Company, ending 15 years of legal limbo. In late 1642 Sir William Berkeley was appointed Governor. He reorganized the Assembly into two houses along the lines of the English Parliament. The new lower house, the House of Burgesses, was to provide a counterweight to the Council- led group that had deposed Harvey. However, they maneuvered to elect one of their own, Thomas Stegg, as the first Speaker of the new House when it convened in March 1643. Speaker Peyton Randolph would support independence in the 1770s. The House of Burgesses was called back by the Royal Governor Lord Dunmore one last time in June 1775 to address British Prime Minister Lord North's Conciliatory Resolution. Randolph, who was a delegate to the Continental Congress, returned to Williamsburg to take his place as Speaker. The House of Burgesses rejected the proposal, which was also later rejected by the Continental Congress. The burgesses met in conventions that served as a revolutionary provisional government for Virginia. Randolph served as the president of the conventions until his death in October 1775. The burgesses did not elect a new speaker, but did elect a new president for the conventions and they would pass the role of the House of Burgesses on to the House of Delegates when they adopted the Constitution of Virginia in June 1776. { \\"wikitable sortable\\" + Speakers of the Virginia House of Burgesses, 1643-1776 !

First published in 1999 by The Free Press, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, it was re-published in 2000 in paperback by Harvard University Press. Warner argues that the right to marry is an inadequate and ultimately undesirable goal for gay rights activism. As well as addressing marriage, he considers other areas in which public discourse stigmatizes certain sexual behaviors, including through sensationalist coverage of sex scandals, public zoning initiatives that marginalize the sex industry, and the attempted use of shame to manage sexually transmitted disease. The book has been described as a classic of the debates on normalcy as a goal for the gay rights movement, and as an important contribution to queer theory. Overview The Trouble with Normal argues that same-sex marriage should not be the sole goal for gay rights activism; that gay activists should work toward equal benefits for domestic partners and unconventional families. When national LGBT activists insist on the overriding importance of marriage, the book argues, it stigmatizes queer people who choose other types of relationships, while ignoring a broad range of legal benefits that could help the entire community, not just legally married couples. Criticizing those who present gay marriage and the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy as the sole remaining aims of the (American) gay rights movement, Warner contends that the institutional sanctioning of certain types of relationship always comes at the expense of others, which are constituted by contrast as abnormal, inferior, and shameful. He argues that any queer rights movement would do better to abandon the pursuit of normality in favour of campaigning for the recognition of broader varieties of sexual expression as dignified. He discusses the part played by the idea of normality in the uneven distribution of sexual shame that inhibits lives, and the negative consequences ‚Äî including greater risk of violence and disease ‚Äî that result. Synopsis Chapter One criticizes the idea that there is some morally compelling aspect to \\"normality\\", arguing that the normal range is simply a statistical category to which there is no ethical obligation to correspond: \\"If normal just means within a common statistical range, there is no reason to be normal or not\\". Warner uses the example of former US president Bill Clinton's impeachment after a sexual scandal to argue that public and political discourse uses shame disingenuously, to portray certain kinds of sexual behaviour as intolerable, when private morality generally recognises the compatibility of sex with dignity. The second chapter argues that as well as being a limited goal, less urgent than the elimination of violence and discrimination against queer people, same-sex marriage actively causes negative consequences both for queer and straight people, because in validating a single, prescribed type of relationship it devalues and makes more difficult other kinds of interpersonal relationship. Warner argues that the campaign for gay marriage threatens to turn the gay rights movement, previously a powerful force against the stigmatization of sex, into a tool for the normalization of queer life. In Chapter Three Warner proposes that by restricting its campaigning to demands for same-sex marriage, the gay rights movement has marginalized and ignored queer counterpublics that it would have served better by presenting a broad range of sexual lives as moral. In the fourth chapter Warner examines the history of zoning regulation changes in 1990s New York City. He argues that stricter regulation of the city's sex- related businesses represents a trend toward the repression of sex and the \\"erosion of queer publics.\\" By removing problematic, visible, queer sex from public spaces, Warner argues, these policies relegated sexuality to a private sphere of presumed heterosexuality. The net effect was to heighten hypocrisy over the conduct of sexual relationships, supporting the impression that the best any sexuality campaigner can aspire to is admission to a limited sphere of normality that is politically sanctioned, but also deliberately placed outside the sphere of the politically debatable. In the final chapter, Warner challenges the assertion, made by gay authors like Larry Kramer, that sexual recklessness is to blame for continuing cases of HIV infection. Warner argues that, on the contrary, the political use of shame to stigmatize certain kinds of sexual activity actually puts more people at risk of contracting HIV and developing AIDS, by marginalizing those in at-risk communities and restricting access to condoms and safer sex advice. He also criticizes abstinence-only sex education as \\"an appalling insult to gay men and lesbians among others\\" and an inadequate response to the problems of public sexual health, asserting that \\"shame and stigma are often among the most intractable dimensions of risk.\\" Commercial and critical reception As the Library Journal noted, The Trouble With Normal was sometimes construed as a straightforward response to Andrew Sullivan's 1995 Virtually Normal. David Bell, in Contemporary Sociology, accordingly characterized The Trouble with Normal as a move in the \\"assimilationist debates\\", over the extent to which gay people should aspire to 'normality', that characterized 1990s and 2000s gay rights activism. In these debates Warner was ranged against Andrew Sullivan and Larry Kramer, who argued that the most radical goals the movement could seek were the acceptance of gay life into the political and cultural mainstream, through rights like marriage. Warner insisted that, on the contrary, queer people were ideally positioned to critique and challenge mainstream institutions and should not settle for mere tolerance. The debate was impassioned; Warner told the Guardian that \\"This Fifties version of how gay life should be that we've been handed is actually not making a lot of people happy\\", while Sullivan asked \\"What could be more boring than to still be referring to yourself as \\"queer\\"?\\" In 2003 the Library Journal described Warner's book as a classic in the field of the debate on normalcy. Queer theorist Judith Butler, with whose idea of the necessarily transgressive nature of queerness Warner takes issue, called the book \\"brave and timely\\", applauding its analysis of sexual shame and noting that \\"one may not concur with every word, but everyone will attest to the power and necessity of the invaluable critical voice offered here.\\" The philosopher Martha Nussbaum, writing in The New Republic, praised the book's moral opposition to \\"the domination of the 'normal': \\"Warner is a deft and thoughtful writer who turns his own experience of the margins into a source of genuine understanding about America and its sexual politics...what Warner's book finally demands of us is...genuine reflection.\\" Nussbaum later called the book \\"clearly written and argued, insightful about human life, and valuable both in its theoretical analysis and its recommendations for practice.\\" Kirkus Reviews praised the \\"lapidary skill\\" with which the book criticized heteronormativity, but objected to its emphasis on the need for an already marginalized gay community to change: \\"Telling gay people that, for various ethical reasons, they shouldn't even want to marry, when they already can't, does not change the fact that laws that enfranchise some while disenfranchising others are discriminatory. Warner's rhetoric persuasively reveals the hierarchical parameters of marriage and the constraints of normalcy, but a more universal approach to his topic would delineate the limitations of marriage for all people, not just queer people. In the end, his polemic leaves standing discriminatory treatment of queers for the sake of a theoretical attack on normalcy.\\" Release details Publishers Weekly noted that, though The Trouble with Normal engaged with a broad social context through its analysis of the Clinton affair, the degree to which Warner criticized the positions of gay advocates Kramer, Michelangelo Signorile, and William Eskridge \\"positions his arguments as an intra-community fight and may limit his readership.\\" The Library Journal recommended the book as a \\"provocative polemic\\" for \\"specialized collections\\". The New York Times characterized Warner as one of the Free Press's \\"contrarian\\" writers, quoting editorial director Elizabeth Macguire as noting that the book's anti- mainstream message had not been universally popular at the publishing house, but insisting that \\"If you don't embrace a book, really believe you produced with the author a good book, it doesn't work. That doesn't have much to do with ideology.\\" Editions * * See also * Times Square Red, Times Square Blue References External links * Interview with author Michael Warner about the book at Genders.org Category:1999 non-fiction books Category:1990s LGBT literature Category:Books about same-sex marriage Category:Books by Michael Warner Category:English-language books Category:Free Press (publisher) books Category:LGBT literature in the United States ","title":"The Trouble with Normal (book)"},{"id":"21564885","text":"In viral marketing, the K-factor can be used to describe the growth rate of websites, apps, or a customer base.

Social K-factor Defined With the advent of social media, a new evolution to the K-factor concept has emerged. The Social K-factor is an indicator of how viral a website is when content is shared from the website onto social media. It is a function of the Social Coefficient, which determines how fast content is spreading through social sharing, and the Sharing Ratio, a measure of how often your content is likely to be shared. As visitors to your website share your website's content on their social networks, the content can go viral because the social media posts attract new visitors who then share more content. The Social K-factor measures the lift delivered from social sharing.

By the age of twelve she had learned to knit as well as how to make ropes (her father was also a ropemaker). In 1553, Queen Mary I came to the throne and in January 1555 it was made illegal by Parliament to hold Protestant views. At least 284 people were condemned for heresy during Mary's reign.

Waste was called before the Catholic Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, Ralph Baines' chancellor, Anthony Draycot, to defend her views; and for these she was condemned.

For some classes of vehicles and in some jurisdictions they are a statutory requirement, for some other vehicles the manufacturer provides a non-statutory system which may be fixed or programmable by the driver. Statutory (UK) Mopeds The legal definition of a moped in the United Kingdom was revised in 1977 to include a maximum design speed of 30 mph (48 km/h). This was further revised to 50 km/h (31 mph) in the 1990s, then 45 km/h (28 mph) in the late 2000s to fall in line with unified European Union licensing regulations.Department for Transport (2008), p.179 \\"Mopeds redefined to 30 mph maximum design speed\\" To comply with this, mopeds typically include some method of onboard speed restriction to prevent the machine exceeding the prescribed speed (on a flat road, in still air, with a rider of standard height and weight). Older models such as the Honda C50 used a simple centrifugal governor as part of the transmission, which progressively and severely advanced the ignition as speed rose past a set point, causing engine power to fall off rapidly at higher rpm and road speed, but maintaining the low- and moderate-speed hill climbing ability of the unrestricted version. Other systems achieved a similar result with simple restrictor flaps in the air intake, much like those used to restrict the power output of full-size motorcycles. Modern mopeds use electronic systems with speed sensors that can cut the ignition spark (and, where fitted, interrupt fuel injection) once measured speed reaches or exceeds the set point, maintaining full power right up to the limited speed. Early restriction methods could be defeated by simple physical modifications (e.g. cutting out the restriction plate). Modern electronic limiters at the very least require replacing the friction rollers in a scooter's CVT transmission, or even changing wheel size and/or reprogramming the engine management system, all in an effort to fool the sensors into detecting a lower than actual road speed. Public services vehicles Public service vehicles often have a legislated top speed. Scheduled coach services in the United kingdom (and also bus services) are limited to either 65 mph or 100 km/h (62 mph) depending on their age (newer coaches have the lower speed version installed, in line with harmonised EU regulations), though for city buses the use of limiters is to satisfy regulatory requirements, as many city buses cannot achieve these speeds even on an open roadway. Heavy goods vehicles HGVs in the UK have been subject to mandatory 60 mph (96 km/h) limiters since the early 1990s, which were subsequently revised to 90 km/h (56 mph) during EU harmonisation. Non- statutory (UK) Dynamic (ISA) The newest form of speed limiters currently being deployed feature the ability to dynamically limit a vehicles top speed based upon a vehicles real time location and the road speed limit. The most popular of these systems is one called VMS with SpeedIQ from Sturdy Corporation. Dynamic speed limiters are being widely adopted by emergency service fleets due to their ability to limit a vehicles top speed during normal operations and then releasing to a higher maximum top speed when en route to an emergency. Additionally, fleets that operate in mixed geographic areas benefit greatly from a limiter that will allow a vehicle to travel at highway speeds as well as limit that vehicle to more commonly traveled residential neighborhoods at significantly lower speeds. Programmable European Citro√´n, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Peugeot, Renault, TeslaTesla now lets you limit the speed of your car with new update as well as some Ford and Nissan car and van models have driver-controlled speed limiters fitted or available as an optional accessory which can be set by the driver to any desired speed; the limiter can be overridden if required by pressing hard on the accelerator. The limiter may be considered as setting the maximum speed (with throttle kickdown to override it) easing the throttle to reduce speed, whereas cruise control sets the minimum speed (with the brake pedal to override it) pressing on the throttle to increase speed. The limiter may shift down through automatic gears to hold the maximum speed. Fixed In European markets, General Motors Europe sometimes allow certain high-powered Opel or Vauxhall cars to exceed the mark, whereas their Cadillacs do not.

There are also third-party companies who will re- flash vehicle computers with new software which will remove the speed limits and improve overall performance. Many small and medium-sized commercial vehicles are now routinely fitted with speed limiters as a manufacturer option, with a mind towards reducing fuel bills, maintenance costs and insurance premiums, as well as discouraging employees from abusing company vehicles, in addition to curbing speeding fines and bad publicity. These limiters are often set considerably lower than for passenger cars, typically at in the UK, with options for listed in countries where these speeds are legal. Often the fitting of a limiter is combined with a small warning sticker on the rear of the vehicle, stating its maximum speed, to discourage drivers who may themselves be delayed by having to follow it from tailgating or other aggressive driving intended to intimidate the lead driver into accelerating. Similarly, most electric cars and vans which are not inherently limited by a low power output or \\"short\\" gearing tend to implement a maximum speed cap via their power controllers, to prevent the rapid loss of battery charge and corresponding reduction in range caused by the much greater power demands of high speeds; for example, the Smart ED, Nissan Leaf, Mitsubishi MiEV, and the Citroen Berlingo EV. The limits are typically in line with those of other deliberately limited vehicles, for a balance that does not overly compromise either range or travel time; e.g. 90 km/h for the Berlingo, 100~120 km/h for the Smart (depending on version). The Leaf is an unusual case, being instead limited to a much higher 145 km/h (90 mph). Also some supercars have speed limiters to prevent instability. Some small economy cars have limiters, because of stability and other safety concerns (short crumple zones, etc.), and to safeguard their small engines from the prolonged overrevving required to produce the power to achieve higher speeds. The first generation Smart was limited to 135 km/h (84 mph) (later generations were unlimited), and the Mitsubishi i to 130 km/h (81 mph). Some heavy goods vehicle operators (typically big-name retailers, rather than haulage contractors) further reduce their HGV limiters from 90 km/h to a lower speed, typically 85 or 80 km/h (53 or 50 mph), in a claimed bid to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. This is again often highlighted by a warning sticker on the truck's tailgate.

The genre began in the 19th century and flowered in the 20th with such authors as Sui Sin Far, Frank Chin, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Amy Tan.  Characteristics and themes  Chinese American literature deals with many topics and themes. A common topic is the challenges, both inner and outer, of assimilation in mainstream, white American society by Chinese Americans. Another common theme is that of interaction between generations, particularly older, Chinese-born and younger, American-born generations. Questions of identity and gender are often dealt with as well.Huang 2006  History   19th-century Chinese American literature  19th-century Chinese American literature has only recently come to be studied, as much of it was written in Chinese. These Chinese-language writings of Chinese Americans immigrants have only recently been made available.University of Illinois Press. Chinese American Literature Since the 1850s. http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/83kxs3zg9780252073489.html 19th-century Chinese American writers were primarily workers and students.Leong 2008 These early Chinese American authors produced autobiographies as well as novels and poems, mostly in Cantonese.Leong 2008 Many wrote in both English and Chinese, sometimes exploring similar themes in each language, sometimes translating their own works from language into the other.Xiaojian Zhao. Review of Chinese American Literature since the 1850s. http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=5898 Tone as well as content differed, as Chinese American writers in English dealt with rampant stereotypes of the Yellow Peril. Among these early writers was Yung Wing, the first Chinese student to graduate from an American University (Yale, in 1854), whose autobiography, My Life in China and America, was published in 1909.Leong 2008  20th-century Chinese American literature  Chinese American literature written of the 20th century is written almost exclusively in English. Edith Maude Eaton, writing as Sui Sin Far, was one of the first Chinese American authors to publish fiction in English, although her works, first published in the teens, were not re-discovered and re-printed until 1995.Gilbert, Sandra M., and Susan Gubar. The Norton Anthology of Literature by Women, vol. 2, 2nd edition, p. 57 In the 1930s, Lin Yutang's My Country and My People (1935), and The Importance of Living (1937), became best-sellers. Chinese American authors became more prolific and accepted after the lifting of the Chinese Exclusion Act. Authors who achieved success in the 1950s included C.Y. Lee (author), whose The Flower Drum Song was made into a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, and Jade Snow Wong, author of Fifth Chinese Daughter. The 1970s saw further progress. Playwright Frank Chin's play, The Chickencoop Chinaman (1971) became the first play by an Asian American to be produced as a major New York production. Maxine Hong Kingston won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1976 for The Woman Warrior: Memoir of a Childhood among Ghosts. In the 1980s, David Henry Hwang won the Obie award for his play, FOB, as well as a Tony Award for Best Play for his M. Butterfly. Bette Bao Lord's Spring Moon (1981) became an international bestseller and an American Book Award nominee. Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club was published to immediate popularity and wide, though not universal, acclaim. The book stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for over forty weeks, and won the National Book Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and the Commonwealth Gold Award. The Joy Luck Club was produced as a major motion picture in 1993 and was nominated for Best Picture. The 1990s saw further growth, as David Wong Louie received acclaim for his short story collection, Pangs of Love, and Eric Liu collected memoirs and essays in The Accidental Asian: Notes of a Native Speaker (1997). Recent history Currently active and acclaimed Chinese American authors are Gish Jen, Jean Kwok, Shirley Geok-lin Lim, and Sandra Tsing Loh. Shawn Wong's novel American Knees, published in 1996, was adapted into an independent feature film entitled Americanese in 2009. Chinese American criticism Frank Chin and others have been vocal critics of popular Chinese American authors, particularly Chinese American women authors, such as Maxine Hong Kingston and Amy Tan. Chin argues that Tan and others paint a world in which Chinese Americans must repudiate \\"the icky-gooey evil of Chinese culture\\".Chin, Frank. \\"Come All Ye Asian American Writers of the Real and the Fake.\\" https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr;=&id;=hb- jKArjedIC&oi;=fnd&pg;=PA133&dq;=\\"Chin\\"+\\"Come+All+Ye+Asian+American+Writers+of+the+Real+and+the+Fake'\\"+&ots;=Tt8RO6Yjry&sig;=DjQdMU0-PMJiqk8894oVEx3aDhg#PPA134,M1 Others have criticized Chinese American women authors for criticizing sexism in Chinese culture; in so doing, critics argue, these women are participating in the \\"racial castration\\" Eng, David. Racial Castration: Managing Masculinity in Asian America, p. 1 of Chinese and Asian American men, who are already \\"materially and psychically feminized\\" by mainstream, white American culture.Eng, David. Racial Castration: Managing Masculinity in Asian America, p. 2 Playwright Frank Chin in a San Francisco Chronicle Datebook section article dated mid 1990s Some of these criticisms are fueled by anger over the way in which female Chinese American authors have portrayed the sexism and patriarchy of Imperial China, ways which male critics feel are sometimes unfair. For example, Maxine Hong Kingston has been criticized for her claim in The Woman Warrior that, in Chinese, the character for \\"woman\\" is also the character for \\"slave.\\" Critics of Kingston claim that while Â•¥ (slave) contains Â•≥ (woman), it is only as a radical to indicate the pronunciation of the character.

was originally established as Fort Stotsenburg in Sapang Bato, Angeles in 1903 under control of the U.S. Army. Officers' quarters and water system constructed 1910‚Äì1911 and a flying school was created in 1912. Construction of steel hangars and a dirt air strip 1917‚Äì1918; a portion of Ft Stotsenburg officially set aside for the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps and named Clark Fld, September 1919. The 3d Aero Squadron was assigned to Clark Field in December 1919 and for the next decade functioned as an observer training unit flying a wide variety of mono and biplanes. In 1922, the 28th Squadron (Bomb) was assigned as a defense force for the Philippines. Clark served as a landing field for medium bombers and accommodated half of the heavy bombers stationed in the Philippines during the 1930s. In the late summer and fall of 1941, many aircraft were sent to Clark in anticipation of war with Imperial Japan. Six B-17Cs and 29 B-17Ds were serving with the 19th Bombardment Group based at Clark The 14th Bomb Squadron of the 19th Bombardment Group had been transferred to the Philippines in September 1941 in a spectacular trans- Pacific flight to Clark Field, and two more squadrons had flown to Clark in October. Military units during WWII Clark and its subordinate airfield at Del Monte were the only airfields in the Philippines capable of heavy bomber operations at the outbreak of World War II. News of the Pearl Harbor attack was received at about 3 am on 8 December in the Philippines. According to the previously-agreed upon plan, if hostilities were to break out, an attack on Japanese bases in Formosa was to be immediately carried out by the 19th Bombardment Group's Fortresses. On 8 December, there were 35 USAAC B-17s in the Philippines, with two squadrons at Clark Field on Luzon with a total of 19 planes, and two squadrons at Del Monte on Mindanao 500 miles to the south with the other 16 B-17s. For reasons which are still unclear even today, the planned raid on Formosa was delayed. Instead, in order to prevent them from being destroyed on the ground by a Japanese air attack, all flyable B-17s based at Clark Field had been ordered into the air and to patrol the waters around Luzon. In the meantime, General Lewis H. Brereton, General MacArthur's air commander, finally got approval to carry out the strike against Japanese bases on Formosa, and the B-17s were recalled to Clark. When the Fortresses returned to Clark, three of them were equipped with cameras for reconnaissance and the remainder were loaded up with 100-lb and 300-lb bombs in preparation for the planned mission to Formosa. The three reconnaissance B-17s were taxiing out for the initial photographic mission to Formosa when about 200 Japanese aircraft struck. Unfortunately, all the P-40 fighters had been recalled for refuelling and were on the ground. . At the end of the day's action it was apparent that the Japanese had won a major victory. The effective striking power of Far East AF had been destroyed, the fighter strength had been seriously reduced, most B-17 maintenance facilities were demolished, and about 80 men were killed. The sole surviving B-17 had not taken off on the morning alert, and had been taken up in the air while the rest were being prepared for the Formosa raid. The Fortresses at Del Monte 500 miles to the south were out of range of the Zeros from Formosa and were left untouched. At Clark Field, three or four of the damaged B-17s were put back into service. They were joined by the B-17s from Del Monte. By 9 December, reconnaissance missions were being undertaken by the 19th Bombardment Group in search of the Japanese fleet. Also, the 17th Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor), 24th Pursuit Group (Interceptor), based at Nichols Field were transferred to Clark with P-40's. On 10 December, a Japanese convoy was spotted, and five B-17s were dispatched. This was the first American bombardment mission of World War II. No fighter opposition was encountered, and some hits were recorded on the transports. That same day, a B-17C piloted by Captain Colin P. Kelly dropped bombs from high altitude on what the crew thought to be a Japanese battleship. Hits were recorded, and a tremendous explosion was observed. Kelly's plane was immediately pounced upon by Zeros, one of which was flown by Sabur≈ç Sakai, who was later to become a famous ace. Kelly guided his heavily damaged plane back towards Clark Field. He ordered the crew to parachute to safety, but before Kelly himself could leave, the aircraft exploded and Kelly was killed. When the surviving crew was questioned, the report was flashed out that they had sunk the Japanese battleship Haruna, and the mission was hailed as a great victory. Captain Kelly was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by President Franklin Roosevelt for his heroism, and was written up in glowing press reports. However, information revealed in the immediate postwar years revealed that the Haruna was nowhere near the area at that time and that the ship most likely struck was the cruiser Ashigari, and it was only fairly lightly damaged by the attack. On 12 December, about 100 Japanese aircraft again hit Clark. The airfield is severely damaged and plans were made to evacuate the facility. On the 19th, the air echelon of the 93d Bombardment Squadron (Heavy), 19th Bombardment Group (Heavy) were transferred from Clark to Batchelor Field near Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia with B-17's. The ground echelon was attached to the 5th Interceptor Command (Provisional) and sent to fight as infantry on Luzon and Mindanao Islands. On Christmas Eve, HQ 19th Bombardment Group (Heavy) and the air echelon of the 28th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) were transferred from Clark to Batchelor Field with B-17's. The ground echelon of the 28th were dispatched to fight as infantry on Luzon and Mindanao. The remaining aircraft and personnel at Clark were evacuated to Australia by 31 December 1941. The base was overrun by Japanese forces less than a week later in early January 1942. Japanese occupation Boeing B-17D Fortress 40-3095 formerly of 11th Bomb Group, 61st Bomb Squadron after being captured at Clark Field, Philippines and being repaired by Japanese. Eventual fate of this aircraft is unknown During the period of Japanese occupation, Clark was known as Mabalacat Airfield, and several auxiliary airfields constructed and used. Lilly Hill, located near the center of the base (15*11'35.96\\"N 120*32'05.14\\"E), was excavated to allow tunnels to be built into its sides for the storage of fuel and munitions in an attempt to protect them from air raids. After the war Lilly Hill (named for the Papanga word for lonely) was so dangerous, because of the large number of unexploded bombs, the jungle was allowed to over take the hill for a decade. When it was finally reclaimed at least one Japanese fighter aircraft was found to have crashed there. The Japanese also dug tunnels and built stone revetments in the ridge line at the north side of Clark(15*13'03.83\\"N 120*32'05.14\\"E). The Americans later built their northern bomb storage facility at the east end of the ridge, the horse stables on the southern side, the rifle range to the north, and the \\"Elephant cage\\" to the west. The airfield was fortified with several Type 88 75 mm AA Guns. Several USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers flying over Clark were shot down by these weapons. Following the surrender of Bataan in April 1942, American and Filipino prisoners were marched past the main gate of the airfield during the Bataan Death March In late 1944, with the tide of the war turning against the Japanese, Vice Admiral Takijir≈ç ≈ånishi decided to form a suicide attack force, the Special Attack Unit. In a meeting at Mabalacat, on 19 October 1944, Onishi told officers of the 201st Flying Group headquarters that he believed the only way to retain control of the Philippines was to put 250-kg bombs on A6M Zero fighter planes and crash them into U.S. carriers, to wreak havoc on the U.S. Fleet and disable them for weeks. Commanded by ≈ånishi, the first Kamikaze missions were launched from Clark Air Base. The first volunteers were 23 pilots of the Imperial Japanese Navy's 201st K≈çk≈´tai, 1st Air Fleet. These were divided into four separate groups: Shikishima, Yamato, Asahi and the Yama Yukio Seki units. At 07:25 on 25 October 1944, the Shikishima unit departed Clark led by Lieutenant Yokjo Seki. At 10:45 am they attacked U.S. ships stationed at Leyte, Philippines during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Five Zeros, led by Seki, and escorted to the target by leading Japanese ace Hiroyoshi Nishizawa, attacked several escort carriers. One Zero attempted to hit the bridge of the but instead exploded on the port catwalk and cartwheeled into the sea. Two others dove at but were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. The last two ran at the , however one, under heavy fire and trailing smoke, aborted the attempt on the White Plains and instead banked toward the , plowing into the flight deck. Its bomb caused fires that resulted in the bomb magazine exploding, sinking the carrier. 1945 recapture Clark Air Base was recaptured by Americans in January 1945 after three months of fierce fighting. Elements of the Sixth U.S. Army cleared most Japanese from the Fort Stotsenburg-Clark Field area and flying activity commenced using the least damaged runway while the field still drew Japanese fire on 25 January 1945; saboteurs and infiltrators sporadically damaged parked aircraft until 10 February 1945. Clark was used as an operational base for several groups in the closing months of the war in the southwest Pacific. Operational units flying from Clark were: * 475th Fighter Group (P-38 Lightning) - flew many missions to support ground forces on Luzon during the first part of 1945. Also flew escort missions to China and attacked railways on Formosa. * 22d Bombardment Group (Heavy) (B-24 Liberator) - Bombed Japanese airfields, shipping, and oil installations in Borneo, Ceram, and Halmahera. * 43d Bombardment Group (Heavy) (B-24) - Struck industries, airfields, and installations in China and Formosa; and supported ground forces on Luzon. * 35th Fighter Group (P-51D Mustang) - Operated in support of ground forces on Luzon. Also escorted bombers and completed some fighter sweeps to Formosa and China. * 421st Night Fighter Squadron (P-61 Black Widow) - Flew night intruder missions against Japanese airfields and ground installations. Also provided protection of B-29 bases on Saipan against night attacks, and flew combat air patrols and interception missions. * 312th Bombardment Group - Performed operational combat testing of Consolidated B-32 Dominator Bomber. The first combat mission took place on 29 May 1945 with a strike against a Japanese supply depot in Luzon's Cayagan Valley. This raid was followed by a series of attacks on Japanese targets in the Philippines, in Formosa, and on Hainan Island in the Tonkin Gulf. Military units during the Cold War B-29 Superfortress 18th TFW F-51Ds in Korea With the end of the war in September 1945, Clark became an immediate dumping ground for aircraft of all types from inactivating fighter and bomber units in the southwest Pacific. Aircraft were flown to Clark and the pilots (along with aircrews and maintenance and support personnel) would get on transports back to the United States for discharge. Many of the aircraft (some almost brand-new) were scrapped although low-hour planes were retained and flown back to the United States storage fields and mothballed. The 20th Air Force 313th Bombardment Wing with four Boeing B-29 Superfortress (6th, 9th, 504th, 505th) Very Heavy bomb groups was reassigned from North Field (Tinian) on 13 March 1946. Between 1946 and 15 June 1948, all of these groups were reassigned or inactivated: * 6th Bombardment Group -> Kadena AB, Okinawa (1 June 1947) * 9th Bombardment Group -> Harmon Field, Guam, (9 June 1947) * 504th Bombardment Group -> Inactivated 15 June 1946. * 505th Bombardment Group -> Inactivated 30 June 1946. On 14 March 1947, the U.S. and the Philippines signed the Military Bases Agreement which provided for use of Clark Air Base until the year 2046 (later amended by the 1966 Rusk-Ramos agreement to 1991). The 18th Fighter Group was assigned to Clark on 16 September 1947. The 18th was the major Far East Air Force unit in the Philippines in the immediate postwar years, flying a mixture of fighter (P/F-47, P/F-51, F-80), and reconnaissance (RB-29, RB-17G) aircraft. The 18th Flew patrols and trained with P-80 Shooting Stars, with the distinction of being the first overseas fighter unit to be jet-equipped. On 20 January 1950, the wing was re- designated the 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing. As a result of the Korean War, the 18th was reassigned from Clark to Pusan AB, South Korea on 1 December 1950. During the Korean War, the 6204th Photo Mapping Squadron was deployed for three months in 1950 performing aerial mapping of both North and South Korea before being replaced. The unit flew adapted Boeing B-17s (as RB-17Gs) for photographic mapping by having its bombing equipment deleted and replaced by photographic equipment. Some cameras were installed in the nose and in the aft fuselage as well. During the Korean War and First Indochina War (1950‚Äì1954), the 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing performed psychological warfare and unconventional operations. Conducted limited operations in French Indochina in 1953 with C-119, B-29, C-54, and C-118 aircraft. During the immediate postwar years and throughout the 1950s, Clark's mission was that of a major supply and maintenance depot for Far East Air Forces (later Pacific Air Forces) along with being a command base with Headquarters, 13th Air Force taking up residence in 1949. 13th Air Force would remain at Clark until its closure in 1991. The 39th Air Division at Misawa AB, Japan deployed the 26th, and later the 509th Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons to Clark from 1954 to 1960 flying F-86D and F Sabres to provide air defense of the Philippine Islands. 405th Fighter Wing F-4C 64-0820 1st TFS 405th FW, Clark AB February 1975 A change of mission occurred at Clark with the activation of the 405th Fighter Wing on 4 September 1959, replacing the 6200th Air Base Wing. The mission changed from that of being a support depot and maintenance facility to that of an operational fighter wing. The mission of the 405th was to provide air defense and offensive fighter operations in the Philippines, Taiwan and other Far Eastern points.

He is known for being a Confederate brigadier general during the Civil War, for his works in the Mississippi Southern Baptist Convention, and for founding the Blue Mountain College. Early life and career Mark Perrin Lowrey was born in 1828, in McNairy County, Tennessee, to Adam and Marguerite (Doss) Lowrey.Wakelyn, p. 291. His parents had immigrated to America from England and Ireland, and Lowrey received no formal education.Warner, p. 195. His father died from yellow fever in Natchez Mississippi, when Lowrey was young.Rosewell G. Lowrey's \\"Lowrey (Mark Perrin) Autobiographical Essay Summary\\" In 1843, he moved with his family to Mississippi, where he became a bricklayer. During the Mexican War, Lowrey enlisted as a private in the 2nd Mississippi Volunteers in 1847.Eicher, p. 355. Neither he nor his regiment ever saw action in the conflict, and Lowrey was mustered out in July 1848.Wakelyn, p. 291; Eicher, p. 355. After the war with Mexico ended, Lowrey married Sarah R. Holmes in 1849. Beginning in 1853, he became a Southern Baptist preacher, serving primarily around the village of Kossuth, Mississippi. After preaching for eight years, the American Civil War broke out and his congregation urged him to join the Confederacy.Mark Perrin Lowrey Biography Lowrey also served as a captain in the Mississippi State Militia in 1861. Civil War service Lowrey entered the Confederate service in 1861 as the colonel of the 4th Mississippi Militia. On December 6, 1861, Lowrey was appointed colonel of the 4th Mississippi Infantry and, on April 3, 1862, he became commander of the 32nd Mississippi Infantry. He fought in, and was praised at, the Battle of Shiloh, Battle of Perryville, the Kentucky Campaign, and the Battle of Chickamauga. At the Battle of Perryville in October 1862, Lowrey was shot in the left arm but stayed on the battlefield. During the retreat which began the next day, he had great difficulty keeping up with the army. He then obtained leave and traveled to his brother's house for safety. After six weeks of recuperation, Lowrey joined back with his forces and fought at the Battle of Murfreesboro on January 1, 1863.Jack D. Welsh's \\"Medical Histories of Confederate Generals\\" (1999) pg. 145. Lowrey as a Confederate Army General officer On October 4, 1863 at the age of 35 Mark Lowrey was promoted to a Brigadier General. It was because of his evangelistic ties and preaching that he came to be known as the \\"Preacher General\\". In December 1864, during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, an officer saw the flash of an enemy gun and yelled to Lowrey, who quickly lowered himself and the bullet stuck and killed a man behind him. Years of bad health and other reasons caused Lowrey to resign his commission as a brigadier general on March 14, 1865, almost one month before the Confederate forces surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse. Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne, Lowrey's divisional commander during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, pronounced Lowrey \\"the bravest man in the Confederate Army.\\" Postbellum career and death After the war, Lowrey moved back to Mississippi and focused on his studies.Annah Walker Robinson Watson's \\"Of Sceptred Race\\" (1910) pg. 151-53. Then, in 1873, he founded the Blue Mountain Female Institute, which later became known as the Blue Mountain College. Lowrey would also serve as president of the Mississippi Baptist convention from 1868 to 1877. Lowrey then persuaded a friend, Colonel William C. Falkner, to run his railroad near the college. Since he was a major shareholder of Falkner's Railroad, the plan was soon carried out.Elmo Howell's \\"Mississippi Home-Places: Notes on Literature and History\\" (1988) pg. 29. The school became quite a success and 3 generations of Lowrey's became presidents of the school himself, two of his sons and a grandson. Following several years of teaching at the Blue Mountain College, Lowrey became very sick and, in 1882, his doctors alerted him that his heart was very weak. Then, on February 27, 1885, while buying a train ticket at Middleton, Tennessee, he turned, gasped, and fell to the floor dead. Possible family wealth Lowrey lore states that sometime after Mark and Sarah were married an English grandfather of Lowrey's mother, Margaret (Doss) Lowrey, died, leaving a six million dollar fortune to his descendants. Before the arrangements could be made for the family to get the money, the Civil War began and the descendants became preoccupied with other matters. At the war's end, Lowrey once again tried to claim his share of the English estate left behind by his ancestor, but it was discovered that the papers pertaining to the money and estate were lost or destroyed.

Beam Piper and John J. McGuire. It is not a part of either Piper‚Äôs Terro-Human Future History series or his Paratime series. It made its first appearance in the January 1954 issue of Astounding Science Fiction. The story was later edited and expanded for its appearance in the 1960 book The Science Fictional Sherlock Holmes. The differences between the two editions of the story are minor, mostly taking the form of added dialogue. Synopsis It has been more than 250 years since the nuclear war devastated the world, and finally the people of Fort Ridgeway (in what had once been Arizona) are advanced enough to go out looking for other surviving communities. The helicopter-borne explorers, Dr. Jim Loudons and Monty Altamont, are on their way to Pittsburgh to dig up an old cache of microfilmed books that was buried at the Carnegie Library before the war. Having so far only encountered stone-age barbarians, they are surprised to find a fort, manned by people with organization, firearms, and literacy. The people living in the fort are descendants of an old pre-war army platoon, and they have maintained their organization and civilization as much as is possible. Also, they seem to have developed a strange religion around a god who died in battle with his adversary, both of whom were later resurrected. The adversary is behind the primitives who periodically attack the people of the ‚ÄúToon,‚Äù and the Toon waits for their god to come back to them. In the meantime, it is up to them to follow his teachings of deductive reading and keen observation. Having secured the Toon‚Äôs promise to assist them in retrieving the microfilm, Loudons and Altamont realize that they are being judged by the Toon. They seem to think that Monty Altamont is either their long-awaited god, or perhaps his adversary. The fate of their mission, not to mention their very lives might just depend on what the Toon decides. Loudons and Altamont and eight members of the Toon set out for Pittsburgh aboard their helicopter. After locating the library‚Äôs storage crypt, Dr. Loudons returns to the fort in the helicopter to get more workers, while Altamont and the eight Toon members stay behind. The local primitives, called Scowrers, launch an attack, appearing in larger numbers than the Toon has ever seen before. The realization that the adversary wants desperately to destroy the little band convinces the Toon members who Monty Altamont really is. Having collected the microfilm and set off for Fort Ridgeway, Loudons tells Altamont that he has seen the sacred books of the Toon, and he is now very worried. Just what will happen to the Toon when they realize that they are mistaken, and that Loudons and Altamont are not really Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes?

Mild amounts of acid mine drainage affect the West Branch and its tributaries. From its headwaters near Interstate 81, the river flows southeast through several water gaps in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, ending at its confluence with the Schuylkill River in Schuylkill Haven. Course The West Branch's source is several small ponds east of Interstate 81, near the small community of Buck Run. The river flows east-northeast, paralleling Valley Road and later the Heckscherville Road. Near Heckscherville, it receives small tributaries Dyer Run, Wagner Run, and Wheeler Creek, all on the left bank. It then flows south and southeast past Minersville, and finally east through a narrow canyon, where it receives Indian Run on the right bank. After exiting the canyon, it turns south and enters an increasingly wide valley. At Cressona, it receives Panther Creek on the right bank and Beaver Creek on the left bank.

Bacho Kiro was born in what is today Byala Cherkva, Veliko Tarnovo Province (then called Gorni Turcheta), to the family of the herdsman Petar Zanev. After finishing the religious school in his village, he joined the Batoshevo Monastery as a neophyte. From 1852 on, he worked as a teacher in various villages, including Koevtsi, Musina, Mihaltsi, Vishovgrad and his native Byala Cherkva, where he lived and taught from 1857 to 1876 with some interruptions. Bacho Kiro also travelled around the Bulgarian lands by foot, calling for armed resistance against the Ottoman rule, and visited Istanbul, Mount Athos, Belgrade and Bucharest. Bacho Kiro established a number of cultural centres (chitalishta); in February 1872, he became the Byala Cherkva head of Vasil Levski's Internal Revolutionary Organisation. Upon the outbreak of the April Uprising in 1876, Bacho Kiro was among the uprising's leaders in the Tarnovo district and a sub-voivode in Father Hariton's detachment. Bacho Kiro took part in the Dryanovo Monastery fightings, and although his detachment was routed by the Ottomans, he managed to escape. However, he was betrayed and captured by the Ottoman government. He was sentenced to death and hanged in Tarnovo. Before his execution, he held a passionate speech and did not ask for mercy. Bacho Kiro was the author of some travel notes and the drama piece Poor Man Tancho. The Bacho Kiro cave near Dryanovo is named in his honour.

(), or OHL, is a Spanish-based multinational construction and civil engineering company. The company is involved in infrastructure and commercial property construction, homebuilding and the operation of toll road and other transport concessions. In the latter, the group is particularly active in Brazil through its majority-owned subsidiary OHL Brasil and in Mexico with OHL M√©xico. OHL also has a majority-owned American subsidiary called Tower-OHL Group which is based in Miami, Florida. OHL was founded by the $900 million merger in 1999 of the firms Obrasc√≥n- Huarte and Construcciones Lain. Since July 2008 the company has been a constituent of the benchmark IBEX 35 stock market index on the Bolsa de Madrid. History The company's roots stretch back to May 1911 and the foundation of Sociedad General de Obras y Construcciones Obrasc√≥n, S.A., whose first project was the construction of two wharfs in the Port of Lisbon. The company grew over the decades, being acquired first by the Banco de Bilbao in 1953 and then by Altos Hornos de Vizcaya 20 years later. Obrasc√≥n fell into financial difficulties in the late 1980s, however, and was bought from bankruptcy for one penny in 1987 by Juan-Miguel Villar Mir, who remains the company's chairman today. Villar turned around the firm's fortunes and it listed on the Bolsa de Madrid in 1991. In 1998 Obrasc√≥n merged with its larger, but struggling, rival Huarte, a major construction firm established in Pamplona in 1927. The following year a further merger was conducted with Construcciones Lain, a publicly traded firm founded as the Spanish arm of John Laing Construction in 1963. This deal created the Obrasc√≥n Huarte Lain group in its current form. On November 30, 2010, OHL acquired 50.1% of the US construction company Judlau Contracting, Inc., specialized in civil engineering with headquarters operations in the state of New York. On April 16, 2014, OHL lost the largest case for damages in the history of Gibraltar, having been judged to fail to comply with the terms of a contract to build a tunnel to cross the Gibraltar International Airport runway.

Biography Early life Elizabeth Murray was born in and spent the first twelve years of her life in Unthank, Scotland, until her older brother James, an up-and-coming merchant, brought her to his new North Carolina home to be his housekeeper. In this capacity, Murray learned the attendant responsibilities, such as \\"keeping accounts with local merchants and vendors, selecting and purchasing the items needed for household consumption, overseeing the work of any servants, and performing numerous chores associated with housecleaning and preparing food and clothing\\" At seventeen, she moved with James and his new bride to London, where Murray saw the city bustling with shop-owning women who sold wide arrays of cloth and other popular goods from all over the world. Also, London, offered her a chance to see the latest fashions in ladies' clothing that were so popular both in Great Britain and in its colonies. Sailing back to America, the Murrays stopped in Boston, and Elizabeth Murray, now twenty-three, decided to stay in the bustling commercial hub to open her own shop. Because many urban women were running taverns and small schools, it was considered an appropriate extension of women's acceptable domestic duties to support themselves through businesses they ran out of their homes. Career Backed by her brother's mercantile connections in Great Britain, Elizabeth established credit in the commercial world and was able to sell the latest fashions from London in her Boston shop. She advertised in local newspapers, such as the Boston Gazette and the Boston Evening-Post, showcasing both her world-class ladies' apparel and her talents as a teacher of \\"Needle Works\\".Boston Evening-Post, May 13, 1751 Additionally, Elizabeth allowed her female students to board with her, to supplement her income. After a trip to London to make more business connections, Elizabeth returned to Boston and sent for James' daughter Dolly, wanting to give her the chance to pursue the \\"superior educational opportunities\\" in the northern city. Dolly worked under both Elizabeth and other local women to gain an education in arithmetic, shopkeeping, reading, and sewing. In 1755, Elizabeth married Thomas Campbell, a trader and ship's captain, thereby trading in her status as an independent single woman for the protection (and legal limitations) of couverture. Their union signified a business partnership, in which Thomas handled the larger commercial transactions, while Elizabeth ran the shop. Additionally, she became part of a female network of shop-owners and teachers in Boston with whom she interacted and traded services with daily. However, by the age of thirty-two, Elizabeth became widowed when Thomas died of the measles in 1759. By 1760, Elizabeth married for a second time to a wealthy old widower named James Smith, who would change her financial status for the rest of her life. Under their prenuptial agreement, James stipulated that she would not be rendered personally, legally, or financial dependent under couverture; instead, Elizabeth would be allowed to keep all of her own money that she had earned as a shopkeeper, and would be entitled to one-third of his considerable estate if he died before her. Because of their wealth, both Elizabeth and James stopped working and enjoyed a leisurely life in Brush Hill, outside of Boston. She did, however, continue to teach women the ways of shopkeeping and other business ventures, financially helping out young women like her nieces Dolly, Betsy, and Anne, as well as local up-and-coming merchants like Ame and Elizabeth Cumings. Additionally, Elizabeth's single, independent friend and prot√©g√© Jannette Day enjoyed the financial and emotional support of her friend. By 1763, Elizabeth's ventures in helping her female friends and family were stymied by the violence in the Boston streets, when colonists became enraged at the taxes imposed on them by the British government. Growing out of the resentment of the Sugar Acts of 1764 and the Stamp Act of 1765 were boycotts on British goods and attacks on loyalists like Andrew Oliver and Thomas Hutchinson. Because Elizabeth's brother James and her husband were involved in housing British soldiers in James Smith's sugar factory when the British landed in Boston in 1768, she and her family became vulnerable to the rioters' hostilities. When her second husband died, Elizabeth became a woman of great wealth, further solidifying her status as an independent, wealthy widow. She decided to leave for London to escape the violence running rampant in Boston; but before she left on a dangerous journey across the Atlantic, Elizabeth wrote her will, leaving lots of money to her family and female friends like Jannette Day and her daughter Jackie.Boston Evening-Post, October 9, 1769 When Elizabeth visited her brother John's family in Norwich, England, she decided to take his daughter Mary Murray (nicknamed Polly) under her wing, teaching her all that she herself had learned as a shopkeeper in Boston. She immediately set upon sending Polly to Boston to make connections in the commercial world and boarding with her merchant friends, the Cumings sisters. They would teach her all she needed to know about shopkeeping and running a business for herself. Additionally, Elizabeth sent her young nephew Jack to voyage with his sister across the Atlantic to Boston, in hopes of his becoming an apprentice for a successful merchant cousin in Rhode Island. Despite the unrest growing in Boston and many of her friends becoming attacked for importing British goods, Elizabeth decided to send Polly and Jack to Boston, anyway. To Elizabeth's surprise, when the Cumings sisters were publicly reviled in the press, their business turned even more successful, because of their insistence on \\" 'Striving in an honest way to Git there Bread'.\\" Thus, women were finding themselves thrust into a world in which their decisions to purchase goods had become fraught with political meaning. Returning to Boston in April 1771 with her new charge Jackie, Elizabeth found Boston much calmer than when she had left a year and a half earlier. She decided to remarry for a third time to fellow shopkeeper Ralph Inman, who would help improve her finances, which she realized were not in good order upon her return to Boston. She and Ralph signed a prenuptial agreement that allowed her to keep her wealth and continue to help young women get started in business. Unfortunately, she quickly learned that this marriage was not a good match, emotionally. Boston's turmoil with the British began to flare up again, and she removed to Cambridge with her niece Dolly to oversee her and her husband's estate, despite the fact that most women were leaving the area altogether. Her husband and her brother remained in Boston, now occupied and closed off by the British, under General Thomas Gage. Elizabeth wrote her husband repeatedly, even after rebel troops had kept her prisoner in her own house, but Ralph did not respond to her entreaties for him to join her in Cambridge. She stayed on in Cambridge, without her husband's protection, \\"overseeing crops, financial matters, and business decisions,\\" all the while feeling abandoned by Ralph. When Ralph did contact his wife that he needed money, he urged her to come to Boston to join him, something she refused to do. When she insisted on defying her husband's wishes, Ralph made plans to sail to Great Britain without her, thereby separating from her indefinitely. Elizabeth decided that her brother James' daughter Betsy should stay with her and learn more shopkeeping, despite the Revolution taking place in Boston. She finally went to Boston to assist her niece Anne Murray, who was working in a Boston shop. When she realized Anne was unhappy with shopkeeping and wished to get married and leave America, Elizabeth did all she could to help solidify the union. Ralph was arrested before he could leave Boston and his property was seized by rebel forces in 1776. She was later castigated in the press for befriending a Scottish officer taken prisoner in Boston named Archibald Campbell, perhaps related to her first husband. She sent him various items in prison to assuage the pain of his imprisonment, such as books, rum, coffee, and sugar. She continued this relationship, despite smears on her name that associated her with political activity and prostitution. When the war drew to a close and her brother James died, many of Elizabeth's nieces and nephews came to live with her and Ralph in Cambridge or nearby. The war had destroyed her and her husband's finances, but they decided to stay with one another. Elizabeth continued to urge her kin to come to Boston to take up shopkeeping, until she fell ill in the spring of 1785. Prior to her death, she drew up a new will that bequeathed much of what was left of her estate to her family, particularly her nieces and family friends. Death and afterward Elizabeth Murray Campbell Smith Inman died on May 25, 1785, with Polly and Betsy at her side. She was buried in a tomb alongside her second husband, James Smith, at the cemetery in King's Chapel in Boston. Her husband, Ralph Inman, received relatively little of her fortune, causing a great deal of stress for Elizabeth's nieces and the rest of her family in disputing her will.

Pedigo and Kenneth L. Pedigo, is a suite of computer administered neuropsychological tests of attention and executive functioning. The PADDS is used in the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children between the ages of 6 to 12 years. The PADDS software program represents a multi-dimensional, evidence-based approach to ADHD assessment, consisting of the Computer Administered Diagnostic Interview (CADI), the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham‚ÄîIV (SNAP-IV) Parent and Teacher rating scales, and the three computer-administered objective measures of the Target Tests of Executive Functioning (TTEF). It calculates a diagnostic likelihood ratio, where each unique data source is allowed to contribute to (or detract from) the prediction of the diagnosis, as well as normalized relative standard scores, t-scores, z-scores, and percentile ranks for comparison to the non- clinical reference group. PADDS history and development One of the most commonly diagnosed childhood disorders referred to mental health clinicians is ADHD. It is a complicated neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder and has an estimated range of occurrence of 2 to 3 percent of the school population and up to 10 percent in other settings. Thus, on average a minimum of at least one child with ADHD and executive functioning disorders is in each classroom in American schools. (Reddy et al.) (Rowland, Leswesne, & Abramowitz, 2002) indicated that prevalence rates for ADHD vary markedly based on presenting symptoms, different assessment approaches used, and the various settings in which the child was tested. A lack of a consensus on what constitutes the core set of symptoms for ADHD complicates and confounds the screening and assessment process (Brown, 2002). Due to these concerns regarding prevalence rates of ADHD, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 2000) and the National Institute of Health (NIH, 1998) have stressed the need to develop new standardized, evidence-based assessments that have strong psychometric properties, and are easily administered in schools and other clinical settings. The major considerations guiding the development of the PADDS is integrating an updated construct of ADHD assessment, while focusing on ways to enhance diagnostic accuracy in an efficient manner. Clinical testing of the PADDS Target Tests of Executive Functioning was conducted on one of the largest samples of age specific, ADHD and non-ADHD subjects collected, with 725 children (240 females and 485 males) age 6 to 12 years (M = 8.63, SD = 1.72) split approximately evenly between those diagnosed with ADHD (n = 395) and age matched Non-ADHD/ Typical peers (n = 330). Data were collected in seven states from a total of 10 data collection sites. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for the overall project was established through Armstrong Atlantic State University in Savannah, Georgia. All research sites included specialty ADHD assessment centers, each with independent IRB oversight, in Illinois, Georgia, Idaho, New Jersey, Tennessee, California, and Florida. Pedigo, Pedigo & Scott (2008). Screening for possible comorbid conditions The Computer Administered Diagnostic Interview (CADI) is used for comorbid screening, to assist clinicians with the collection and consolidation of pertinent patient information. The clinical protocol consists of 113 questions covering the major domains of co-occurring disorders. These areas include a medical and developmental history, emotional/social functioning, depression and anxiety symptoms, behavioral issues, school history, and attention/hyperactivity symptoms. This information is necessary to help structure an individual assessment process and to support recommendations that might be generated. The information is reviewed, with the parent or guardian, for cross validation of any concerns presented. Screening for inattention and hyperactivity The Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham‚ÄîIV (SNAP-IV) rating scale forms are included for parent / guardian and teachers to complete. The SNAP-IV rating scales offer categorical and dimensional input across the 18 core diagnostic items from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV Fourth Edition-Revised. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert scale for severity. These behavioral criteria when used in the ascribed manner have produced reliable sensitivity and specificity in identifying ADHD cases relative to non-clinical reference groups. (Power, T. J., Andrews, T. J., Eiraldi, R. B., Doherty, B. J., Ikeda, M. J., DuPaul, G. J., & Landau, S.; 1998) (Zolotor, A. J., & Mayer, J.; 2004) Objective measures The Target Tests of Executive Functioning (TTEF) consist of three target subtests, Target Recognition, Target Sequencing and Target Tracking. They are designed to place distinctly different demands on several key areas of executive functioning that have been identified as important to ADHD assessment.(Biederman, J., Monuteaux, M. C., Doyle, A. E., Seidman, L. J., Wilens, T. E., Ferrero, F., Morgan, C. L., & Faraone, S. V.; 2004). The tests tap working memory, sequential memory and procedural memory functions, and help provide an objective assessment of a subject‚Äôs ability to employ various but not all executive processes such as planning, attending, organizing input, storing and retrieving information, modulating emotions and sustaining effort. These task demands have been consistently identified as areas of difficulty for children known to have ADHD.(Russell Barkley; 1997) Demands basic to all three target subtests *The child is pre-loaded to search and detect relevant information *The child must inhibit irrelevant stimuli *The child must use a metacognitive strategy forcing the use of internal dialogue *The child must wait a short lag time before employing task demands *The child must inhibit while formulating a plan of action *The child must formulate, reconstitute and execute plans in the face of changing or novel stimuli *The child must be sensitive and responsive to feedback *The child must be able to do the above to discover that there are recurrent patterns presented in the task demands *The child must employ motivational and emotional control in the service of ongoing activity *The child must evaluate outcome against plans, intentions and feedback to direct future efforts accurately Task specific demands for target recognition Target Recognition takes approximately 8‚Äì10 minutes to complete, this subtest presents five large colored squares with smaller squares inside them. Below the squares are five small boxes labeled 1 to 5. The colored squares simultaneously blink on and off the screen at 1 ¬Ω second intervals, in differing patterns for a total of 153 presentations. The child is taught a strategy to read from left to right and to count the number of large squares with small squares inside them of the same color and then to click on the corresponding number in the small box below labeled 1 to 5. Specific requirements for task completion include among others: Attention to detail, avoiding distraction, maintenance of effort or persistence, holding information in mind through the use of metacognition, feedback, and emotional regulation while developing a response to changes in novel stimuli. Task specific demands for target sequencing Target Sequencing takes approximately 8‚Äì10 minutes to complete, this subtest presents five large colored circles. A small colored square moves through each of them starting in the middle or at either of the end circles. The child is taught to attend only to circles when the square matches it in color and to say the name of the color to him or her self while at the same time disregarding the circles that have squares with a different color. Once the squares have moved through all five circles the child clicks on each of the circles that had matching colors in the same order that they stated to him/herself. First match first, second match second and last match last. Specific requirements for task completion include among others: Attention to detail, avoiding distraction, maintenance of effort or persistence, holding information in mind through the use of metacognition, feedback, and emotional regulation during the initiation and follow through of a response to complex sequences while remaining sensitive to changes in novel stimuli. Task specific demands for target tracking Target Tracking takes approximately 8‚Äì10 minutes to complete, this subtest presents four colored shapes at the top and bottom of the screen. The computer creates one move at a time two and three step moves that the child must repeat/recreate in the same order seen. First move first, second move second and last move last. Specific requirements for task completion include among others: Attention to detail, maintaining divided attention, holding information in mind, maintenance of effort or persistence and emotional regulation while completing complex two and three step instructions. Scoring and reporting The PADDS System and Summary Reports presents the incremental input of multiple forms of information that research has shown to be most reliable and valid for ADHD assessment. (Frazier & Youngstrom; 2006). The PADDS system uses a comparison of two well-defined reference groups namely ADHD and Non-ADHD. Each component is calculated in additive or subtractive manner for and against a diagnosis in consideration of the ADHD Base rate. The inputs are displayed in a real time format via a computer generated Nomogram presenting an individual and an overall predictive index of likelihood ratios establishing evidence for or against a diagnosis. Results are likewise presented in a normalized, relative Standard score, T-score, Z-Score, and Percentile rank format for comparison to the non-clinical reference group. The Nomographic display of the individual and cumulative inputs are evaluated stepwise via the calculation of likelihood ratios applied incrementally with a Fagan's Nomogram, (Fagan TJ; 1975) to produce an overall predictive index beginning with a calculated base rate, and combining the results of the other measures, in either an additive or subtractive manner, to provide a post-test probability. When these components are used in conjunction with clinical judgment they have proven to be highly effective for consideration of diagnosis, in highlighting and documenting a need for further evaluation or actions, and may allow the clinician to evaluate their own diagnostic practices and effectiveness over time.

The group is composed of two winners and a runner-up of Pinoy Pop Superstar. The line-up was originally composed of Jona Viray, Aicelle Santos and Maricris Garcia. The group's final line-up included only Aicelle Santos and Maricris Garcia; Jona departed the group on December 15, 2013. La Diva has sold more than 20,000 albums in the Philippines, and earned several achievements including Awit Awards and two PMPC Star Awards for Music. These successes lead the group to being the fourth best-selling female group in the Philippines behind the Sexbomb Girls, Aegis and the Mocha Girls. They are known for the 2012 hit \\"I Know He's There,\\" which was featured in the OST of Legacy. The group revealed that they officially disbanded on June 13, 2015. History In May 2008, it was confirmed that the GMA Artist Center would be forming a female music trio called La Diva. With its \\"Three of a Kind\\" segment, the musical variety show was ready to introduce a new generation of \\"divas.\\" Member Jonalyn Viray noted that a meeting for the creation of La Diva was held as far back as January 2008, with the stipulation that each member of the group would maintain their own identity, conducive to their eventual solo careers. While the members of La Diva aren't exactly certain of how the group was formed, they did cite their past experience on the singing competition, Pinoy Pop Superstar, as their common link. Viray and Garcia were Grand Champions of the first and third seasons, respectively, and Santos was the runner-up of the second season. From October 24‚Äì28, 2011, La Diva was invited to guest on three shows in Indonesia. They performed hits such as \\"I'm Yours\\" and \\"Empire State of Mind.\\" On the now-defunct talk show, Showbiz Central, it was reported and confirmed that La Diva were going to begin working on an international album. La Diva: self-titled debut album The group's first self-titled debut album was released, and a promotional tour was made at major record bars across the Philippines in November 2009. The album contained 10 tracks, including covers of the songs \\"Apologize,\\" \\"Angels Brought Me Here,\\" \\"I'm Yours,\\" \\"Best of My Love,\\" \\"Stand Up For Love,\\" and \\"Gaano Kadalas Ang Minsan,\\" and original tracks including \\"Kasiping Ka\\" (the album's carrier single), \\"One Last Goodbye,\\" and \\"Rosalinda.\\" Members Final Line-Up Members (2008-2015) *Aicelle \\"AA\\" Santos (born February 24, 1985) is a Filipina soul, R&B;, pop and jazz singer-songwriter, actress, and pianist, who first emerged in the Philippine music scene as a contestant in a nationwide search for the Philippines' next big singer on the first season of ABS-CBN's Star in a Million. She has been dubbed the First Undefeated Pinoy Pop Superstar for achieving eight-straight wins on GMA 7's Pinoy Pop Superstar, and was hailed as the Philippines' \\"Ballad Princess.\\" She is the oldest member of the group. *Maricris \\"Cris\\" Garcia (born September 26, 1987 in Caloocan City, Manila, Philippines) is a Filipino singer and actress best known for winning Pinoy Pop Superstar Season 3. She first auditioned for the premiere season of the same show, but did not emerge as a finalist. Two years later, she won the competition with her rendition of Barry Manilow's \\"One Voice\\" during the Grand Finale held at Araneta Coliseum. She was the 3rd Pinoy Pop Superstar champion. Her voice is distinctly similar to that of the Divine Diva Zsa Zsa Padilla, thus earning the title of \\"Divine Princess.\\" She is the second oldest member of the group, and now the \\"Queen of GMA Teleserye Themesongs.\\" (2008-2013) member *Jona Viray (born November 15, 1989 in Marikina City, Philippines) is a Filipina singer and occasional actress.

Thematically, La Diva's music highlights female independence and empowerment, specifically in such songs as \\"Angels Brought Me Here\\" and \\"Best of My Love.\\" The trio offers a blending of vocal styles: Viray's soprano, Garcia's mezzo- soprano, and Santos' alto ranges respectively. Image La Diva was known for their \\"belting\\" vocals and \\"sexy\\" styling. Their label, Sony BMG Philippines, described the group as a \\"pop group characterized by bold, bright outfits, and big, catchy hooks punctuated by rap verses and an 'in-your-face swagger.'\\" Styles and themes La Diva has recorded R&B;/novelty/pop tracks with styles encompassing urban, contemporary and dance-pop genres. They have named former R&B; female group Destiny's Child and fellow Filipina singer Regine Velasquez as among their influences. Jona's departure, hiatus and disbandment Though the group was experiencing a string of success, Jonalyn Viray decided to leave on December 15, 2013 to pursue growth opportunities as a solo artist. Her departure was announced via GMA Network 's Facebook page. Viray's departure left Aicelle Santos and Maricris Garcia as a duo. After Viray's departure, the remaining members of the group, along with their management, took a year-long hiatus. Though initial plans for a follow-up album fell through, in late 2014 the duo continued to make guest appearances on various GMA Network shows. Julie Anne San Jose made occasional appearances with the duo, temporarily replacing Viray during guest appearances and performances in early 2015. Eventually, the group faced management issues leading to a failed album, eventually leading to the duo's disbandment on June 13, 2015. At present, Aicelle Santos and Maricris Garcia are still artists of GMA Network, making cameo appearances in some of the network's programs. Jonalyn Viray eventually signed with Star Music, launching her career as a solo artist under the stage name, Jona.

Life B√∏rresen was descended from a merchant family. As a child, he was given violin, cello and piano lessons. When B√∏rresen made clear to his father that he wished to become a composer, the latter arranged for him to study at the Royal Danish Conservatory in 1895. There he studied composition with Johan Svendsen. After further private studies, his First Symphony was privately premiered in 1901. It made his name as an up-and-coming composer. There followed travels in Germany, France and Belgium, where he made many useful connections. From 1902 on he divided his time between Copenhagen and Skagen where he maintained a second home. B√∏rresen was an important organizer of several Danish music festivals and served as the president of Danish Composers Union between 1924 and 1949. At the time of his death, he was widely regarded as one of Denmark's most important musicians.

He made many studies of the inmates in hospitals and institutions for the criminally insane, and he studied the heads of guillotine victims. G√©ricault's Insane Woman, her mouth tense, her eyes red-rimmed with suffering, is one of several portraits he made of the mentally ill that have a peculiar hypnotic power. These portraits present the physical facts with astonishing authenticity, especially in contrast to earlier idealized commissioned portraiture.

Delyo was born in Belovidovo (today Zlatograd) in the Smolyan region in the 17th century. He headed an armed detachment of rebels in the central Rhodopes and acted against the Ottoman authorities' Islamization of the local Bulgarian population. In 1720, he led a group of united rebel detachments that attacked Raykovo (today a neighbourhood of Smolyan) in revenge for the murder of 200 locals who refused to convert from Christianity to Islam. Delyo was mentioned in Historical notebook, an 18th-century document of disputed authenticity. Delyo is a popular character in Rhodopean folk songs and legends. He is presented as a protector of the local population and an opponent of the local Ottoman authorities. He is glorified as being unkillable by a standard sword or gun, so his enemies cast a silver bullet in order to murder him. According to the legends, Delyo was the son of a poor craftsman and was taught tailoring by his uncle in Enidzhe (Giannitsa), but upon getting to know Bulgarians from around Gyumyurdzhina (Komotini), he organized a rebel detachment to counter the Ottoman atrocities. The most popular folk piece about Delyo is \\"Izlel e Delyo haydutin\\" (\\"Delyo the hajduk has gone out\\"), a song from the Central Rhodopes that has been recorded in various versions. The song is best known as performed by Bulgarian folk singer Valya Balkanska. It was launched into space in 1977 as part of the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes' Golden Record which includes a multicultural selection of music.

In 1931 Kopiniƒç joined the Communist Party of Slovenia (KPS), and shortly later was sent to Moscow. In 1936 he was sent by the Comintern as \\"military counsellor\\" to help the Republic as the Spanish Civil War started. There he became commander of the Spanish Republican Navy yard at Cartagena. Then, from 1936 to 1938 he served on the republican submarine flotilla. Together with I. A. Burmistrov and N. P. Yegipko, Kopiniƒç, in spring 1938, Kopiniƒç participated to the hazardous journeys which their submarines made from France, where they had been repaired, along the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula through the Straits of Gibraltar to Cartagena, i.e., a route almost entirely controlled by the nationalist forces. After the Spanish Civil War Kopiniƒç stayed in Paris as Spanish republican diplomat, provided also with a Soviet passport. During World War II Kopiniƒç headed the chief Soviet intelligence center in Zagreb, part of the Red Orchestra network, and was instructed by the Comintern to establish a new party organization independent from the KPJ. Kopiniƒç set up a radio-transmitter in Zagreb in 1940 which become the major information point between the Italian and Greek communist parties and the Comintern in Moscow. Also for this reason, it seems, the KPJ preserved pre-eminence in the Southeastern European region, backed by the Comintern. That lasted up to the Cominform Resolution of 28 June 1948 (resulting from the Tito‚ÄìStalin split). From 1946 to 1949 Kopiniƒç was in Turkey but nothing is known about this period except that he continued to work as a Soviet intelligence officer.

The card was originally designed to protect the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 undocumented immigrants in New Haven from being robbed or assaulted. All city residents can receive the card, which serves as a form of identification, debit card with a capacity of $150, library card, and a way to pay for parking meters. The cards were first issued in July 2007, and were the first municipal identification cards issued in the United States. The card costs $5 for children or $10 for adults. Background Illegal immigration, especially from Mexico and other Latin American countries, has been a controversial political issue in the US for many years. Undocumented immigrants in New Haven were often targets of robbery, and sometimes murder because they were less likely to go to police due to their immigration status. It is also harder for undocumented immigrants to get bank accounts, causing some to carry around larger sums of cash. New Haven has historically had a favorable policy toward immigrants. In December 2006, the New Haven police instituted a policy of not asking crime victims or witnesses about their immigration status, unless they were suspected of being involved in a crime - the first policy of its kind in Connecticut. Planning Municipal ID cards were first proposed in 2005, as the result of a study conducted by Unidad Latina en Accion (ULA) a New Haven-based grassroots social justice organization. ULA is a leading member of the Connecticut Immigrant Rights Alliance, a statewide coalition including immigrant, faith, labor, civil rights and human service organizations. Junta for Progressive Action, an advocacy group, and Yale Law School students. The proposal received a positive reaction, but was not adopted. Then, in December 2006, the mayor of New Haven, John DeStefano, Jr., announced that he was reviving the plan. The city then redrafted plans, and in May 2007 unveiled the new Elm City Resident Card that has multiple uses, so that it would be useful to all residents of New Haven. Approval On 4 June 2007, New Haven aldermen voted 25-1 in favor of accepting $250,359 in private funds from the First City Fund Corporation to fund the Elm City Resident Card. Aftermath Immigration raid Two days after the card was unveiled in 2007, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 32 illegal immigrants in the city. Immigration office raid In December 2007, 6 months after the plan was approved, federal agents from the Department of Health and Human Services raided the offices of the Community Action Agency of New Haven with a warrant for all documents from 2003 onward. The agents asked whether they had been given instructions about giving aid to illegal immigrants. Other municipal ID cards On January 15, 2009, the city/county of San Francisco launched the SF City ID Card, a municipal identification card program modeled after New Haven's. New York canceled a plan to issue driver's licenses for illegal immigrants after strong opposition. Opposition Just before the ID cards were approved, two groups - Danbury-based Citizens for Immigration Control and the North Branford-based Southern Connecticut Citizens for Immigration Reform - wrote and distributed flyers around New Haven criticizing the Card. The Southern Connecticut Citizens for Immigration Reform have also criticized the plan as hurting New Haven's workers who are legal residents. Other critics argue that it will entice illegal immigration and undermine border security. In early 2008, opponents filed a Freedom of Information request to make public the names, addresses and photos of everyone who has an ID card. On June 25, 2008, Connecticut's Freedom of Information Commission upheld the city's decision to reject this request and protect the privacy and safety of holders of the Elm City ID.

He also has served as the chairman of the Selection Committee for the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Guerrero is also credited with revitalizing an athletics program that was struggling at the time of his hire, but he has been criticized for many of his hiring decisions, particularly in football and men's basketball. Guerrero retired from his position as athletic director of UCLA in June 2020, after his contract expired, citing his health and a desire to spend more time with his family. Guerrero was replaced with Boston College athletic director Martin Jarmond .

Guerrero led the negotiations that solidified the relationship between UCLA and the Rose Bowl, resulting in a $152 million renovation/restoration project that will benefit the Bruin football program for decades upon its completion in 2013. Furthermore, the $136 million Pauley Pavilion renovation project, spearheaded by Guerrero, is slated to be completed by the fall of 2012. UCLA continued to enhance its athletic facilities, including the completion of the Bud Knapp Football wing of the Acosta Center, and the sports medicine and athletic performance centers in the same complex. A new golf practice facility and the Easton Softball Stadium renovation, benefiting the Bruins' golf and softball powers, respectively, were completed for the 2004-05 season. The installation of synthetic turf at Spaulding Field was completed in 2006, the final phase of the Acosta Center project (Olympic sport locker rooms) was completed in 2007 and the $16 million Spieker Aquatic Center was completed in the summer of 2009. As of 2019, UCLA has 118 NCAA team championships, more than any other university except Stanford. Entering the 2019‚Äì20 school year, Guerrero announced that he would retire in June 2020. At the time, UCLA had won 32 NCAA titles during his tenure, the most of any school under its current athletic director. However, none of those championships had been in the school's preeminent sports‚Äîfootball and men's basketball. The football program had never won a conference championship or appeared in a major bowl game under Guerrero. The men's basketball program did not add to their record 11 national titles, though they advanced to the Final Four three straight years under coach Ben Howland. Other committees and awards Guerrero has extensive experience in committee work at both the NCAA and conference level. In 2004-05, he completed a multi-million dollar agreement with ISP Sports (now IMG College), a premier national collegiate sports marketing organization. He has also reorganized the External Relations area, integrating Corporate Sponsorships, Marketing, Development and Sports Information under one umbrella, in anticipation of a major revenue generating initiative designed to address capital project needs, operational support, and program endowments. In June 2010, Guerrero completed a five-year term on the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Committee. As the Chair in 2009-10, he served on the NCAA Advisory Committee. He was also a member of the \\"College Basketball Partnership,\\" a group formed by NCAA president Myles Brand that included many of the most influential people in the sport. He has also served as Chair of both the Pac-10 Athletic Directors Committee, the Budget and Finance Committee, and numerous other Pac-10 committees. He is currently a member of the Nominating, Revenue Sharing, Men's Basketball Tournament, Bowl, and Rose Bowl Management committees. He has also served on other NCAA committees, the Baseball Academic Enhancement Committee, and at the time of his hire by UCLA was serving as the second vice president of the Division I-AAA Athletic Director's Association. Guerrero was president of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) and a member of the NACDA Executive Committee from 2011-12, and served as president of the Division I Athletic Directors Association in 2010-11. Guerrero is presently serving a second term on the Executive Board member of the National Consortium for Academics and Sport. As a result, he has spearheaded unprecedented growth in the Academic Support and Life Skills program at UCLA. During Guerrero's tenure (27 quarters), student-athletes earned 5,703 spots on the Director's Honor Roll (3.0 or higher grade-point average for a quarter) and student development programming, such as the creation of Wooden Academy, and community service activities for the program are at an all-time high. Guerrero was named one of the nation's Top 100 Most Influential Hispanics by Hispanic Business Magazine (October 2004) and the May 5, 2003 issue of Sports Illustrated listed him #28 among the 101 Most Influential Minorities in Sports. He was one of 28 people whose photo was featured on that issue's cover. In March 2011, Guerrero was recognized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) at the Guardian of the Games Awards Show by presenting him with the Clifford Wells Award for distinguished service to the organization. In April, he was presented with the Crystal Eagle Award by CORO Southern California, an organization that provides training of civic and government leaders. In May 2011, he was honored by the Black Coaches and Administrators Association as by awarding him as the Dr. Myles Brand Administrator of the Year. In addition to his most recent accolades, Guerrero has earned numerous honors in the past nine years. In June 2007, he was named the NACDA Division I West Region Athletic Director of the Year. His other honors include the UCLA Latino Alumnus of the Year (October 2002); Cal State Dominguez Hills' Alumnus of the Year (March 2003); and \\"Father of the Year\\" by the Father's Day Council of the American Diabetes Association (June 2003). On September 10, 2002, the Los Angeles City Council honored him with Dan Guerrero Day. He also became the first athlete in any sport at Banning (Wilmington, CA) High School to have his jersey (#8 in baseball) retired (April 2003). Criticism The majority of his high-profile coaching hires have been roundly criticized, for either the lack of vetting process or unwarranted contract extensions. The hiring of men's basketball Coach Steve Alford raised questions regarding the vetting process when UCLA alumni and fans learned that Alford had publicly supported former Iowa basketball player Pierre Pierce who was accused of sexual assault and later pleaded to a lesser charge. When given the opportunity to address the scandal during the second question of his introductory press conference at UCLA, Alford stated that \\"All I can tell you with that situation is I followed everything that the University of Iowa, the administration, the lawyers that were hired,\\" Alford said, \\"I did everything that I was supposed to do at the University of Iowa in that situation.\\" In response to criticism about this, Guerrero proclaimed that Alford \\"gets a clean slate\\" at UCLA. Nine days later, Alford apologized for his actions in the scandal via a prepared statement. Guerrero also issued a statement at the time regarding the situation. In response to the Alford hiring, several fans and alums launched an online petition calling for his termination by UCLA Chancellor Gene Block.http://org.credoaction.com/petitions/hold-ucla-s- athletic-director-accountable-for-hiring-a-reported-rape-apologist-as- basketball-coach On September 3, 2017, Guerrero was presented the NFF John L. Toner Award and was booed mightily by the Bruin faithful at halftime of the UCLA-Texas A&M; football game. On November 11, 2017, two aerial banners were flown over the Rose Bowl prior to the UCLA-ASU football game, reminding fans that during Guerrero's tenure, the UCLA football team has never won a conference title or made a BCS bowl game. Similar protests have been planned by disgruntled UCLA fans, frustrated by Guerrero's perceived lack of success. Education Guerrero received his bachelor's degree in History from UCLA in 1974 on a baseball scholarship as a second baseman. He earned a master's degree in Public Administration in 1982 from California State University, Dominguez Hills. Personal life Guerrero, who was raised in Wilmington, CA, was inducted into the UCLA Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996. Guerrero is married to the former Anne Marie Aniello and they have two grown daughters Jenna and Katie.

The trail system consists of two main segments, the Root River segment, and Harmony-Preston Valley segment. The trails are used mainly for bicycling, hiking, and inline skating in the summer, and for cross country skiing in the winter. Much of the trail, especially the Root River segment, is built along a former Milwaukee Road (Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad) railbed following the contours of the Root River valley. The trail was originally paved in the 1980s, and repaved by June 2008.  Root River segment  in length, the trail runs predominantly east/west, following the meanders of the Root River for much of the distance. Because most of this trail segment was constructed on an abandoned rail grade, most of the inclines and curves are quite gradual. The trail intersects six towns along the way: * - Fountain, Minnesota (western terminus of trail segment) * - junction with Harmony- Preston Valley segment * - Lanesboro, Minnesota * - Whalan, Minnesota * - Peterson, Minnesota * - Rushford, Minnesota * - Houston, Minnesota (eastern terminus of trail segment)  Harmony-Preston Valley segment  in length, the trail runs predominantly north/south.

It is located in the Split-Dalmatia County. Location Located in inland Dalmatia, south of the source of the River Cetina, northeast of the State route D1 between the towns of Sinj and Vrlika. The Lake is on the course of the River Cetina, bounded by Svilaja mountain to the southwest and Dinara mountain to the northeast. Building of the dam The Lake is fed by water from the Cetina River, and drains an area of 3,700 km2, while the total catchment area of the Cetina is around 12,000 km2. The annual discharge is around 105 m3 s‚àí1 as a consequence of a mean annual rainfall of 1380 mm. This is why the artificial lake was created by building a dam on Cetina River in 1958, some 25 km downstream. The Peruƒáa lake was the first large reservoir created in karst and the first remote reservoir in the Cetina Hydropower System. The reservoir was impounded in the Cetina canyon upstream of the Hrvataƒçko Polje (field) by the construction of the 63 m high Peruƒáa earth dam and grout curtain. The Peruƒáa lake reservoir active storage is about 37% of the mean annual inflow, and it considerably affects the Cetina flow regulation at the downstream power plants between Sinjsko Polje (field) and the Adriatic. The head concentration which is the result of Peruƒáa Dam construction is used by the Peruƒáa Hydroelectric Power Plant. The Peruƒáa lake reservoir's active storage is 565 million m3 at the maximum operating level at an elevation of 361.50 m.a.s.l. The maximum reservoir flood level is 362.00 m.a.s.l. This was considered a great achievement at that time. The majority of the catchment drains calcareous are rocks of the Cretaceous period, predominantly limestone. Peruƒáa lake is the third largest lake in Croatia by size. It is spread over 10‚Äì20 km¬≤, and is 60‚Äì70 m at its maximum depth, depending on quantity of rain/snow in winter. Building the dam on the Cetina and creating the lake, has limited flooding downstream. Dalmatia has secured a greater energy supply. Before it was built, the State of SFRY nationalised land which belonged to the inhabitants of the neighbouring settlements of Vrlika, Garjak, Kosore, Je≈æeviƒá, Laktac, Dabar, , Zasiok, Biteliƒá, Rumin, Hrvace, Satriƒá, Potravlje, Maljkovo, Oti≈°iƒá and Maovice. In the middle of the lake, there was an old Orthodox Dragoviƒá Monastery. Before the artificial lake for the hydroelectric power station at Peruƒáa was created, the Dragoviƒá monastery was moved to a hill not far from the old fortress at Gradina. Croatian War of Independence Peruƒáa Lake The Peruƒáa Dam was gravely damaged during the Croatian War of Independence, when on January 28, 1993, in the aftermath of Operation Maslenica, at 10:48 a.m., the dam was blown up in an intentional effort to destroy it by Serbian/Yugoslav army forces. They mined it with 30 tons of explosive and detonated the charges with the intention of harming thousands of Croatian civilians downstream. The explosion caused heavy damage, but ultimately failed to demolish the dam. The Croatian communities in the Cetina valley (from Sinj to Omi≈°) were nevertheless in great danger of being flooded by water from Peruƒáa lake. The actions of the UNPROFOR officer Mark Nicholas Gray (Major in the British Royal Marines) prevented the disaster at the Dam because before the explosion he had raised the spillway channel and reduced the level of water in the lake by four meters. This prevented total collapse of the dam and engineers were quickly able to maintain the integrity of the dam. Subsequently, the Croatian forces intervened and recovered the dam and the surrounding area. On January 29, a small Croatian army team, supported by engineers previously employed in dam maintenance, verified that the main outlet valve could be accessed. It was accessible but stuck due to two years of neglect, loaded with 700 tons of hydrostatic pressure. The engineers then refilled the oil in the hydraulic pumps and used an UNPROFOR engine to restart them. This allowed for the lake to finally drain into Cetina, at a rate of 187 m3/s. In August 1993, HEP started to repair the dam. The works on the dam were completed some time after the war ended, in May 1996. In 2002, Colonel Gray was awarded the MBE (although not for his actions at Peruƒáa). In 2011, Croatian President Ivo Josipoviƒá decorated four Croatian soldiers for valor in combat at Peruƒáa. On 27 January 2013, the 20th anniversary of the HV recapture of the Peruƒáa dam, Gray was awarded Order of Duke Domagoj by president Josipoviƒá.

They speak various forms of Mandarin dialects such as Jilu, Jiaoliao, and Zhongyuan. There is a small Shandong community in Singapore and Malaysia. Nine-tenths of the early overseas Chinese in Korea also came from Shandong. Minority groups include the Hui and the Manchus. Shandong citizens are also known to have the tallest average height of any Chinese province. As of 2010, 16-to 18-year-old male students in Yantai measured 176.4 cm (5'9.5), while female students measured 164 cm (5'4.5). History Modern-day Shandong is the location of the Kingdom of Qi (state) During the Warring States Period. It was the last Kingdom to be annexed by the Qin (state) State prior to the beginning of the Qin Dynasty. After the brief 15 year unification by the Qin Dynasty, the empire broke into Eighteen Kingdoms. Present day Shandong was split into two feudal states, Jiaodong and Jibei. The Han State, headed by Liu Bang, (comprising present-day Sichuan province, Chongqing, and Southern Shaanxi) unified the kingdoms to form the Han Dynasty. After 400 years, the Han Dynasty fell and the empire scattered into the Three Kingdoms period. During this time, present-day Shandong belonged to the Northern State of Cao Wei established by the Warlord Cao Cao. After the disintegration of the Cao Wei Dynasty, the area of present-day Shandong was ruled by the Tuoba Clan of the Xianbei Tribe during the Eastern Wei. The Eastern Wei eventually fell to the Northern Qi Dynasty which lasted 27 years before it was overtaken by the Northern Zhou of central China.Yang Jian was able to recapture ruling power to the Han Chinese from the Xianbei and establish the Sui Dynasty after centuries of Xianbei rule and division between different states, becoming Emperor Wen of Sui. After unifying the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the Sui Dynasty paved the way for the Tang Dynasty and many years of prosperity and peace. The Tang Dynasty fell about 300 years after its inception. The empire again, fragmented, this time into many different states whose borders are roughly the outline of the present day provinces. During this time Shandong was known as the Later Liang (Five Dynasties) Kingdom. Throughout its history, the coastline of Shandong was particularly susceptible to so-called Wokou Pirates. After the Second Opium War the Treaty of Tianjin (1858) forced the Manchu Ching Empire, ruled by the Manchu to open more ports to Western Nations. As a result, there were considerable foreign settlements by the British, Germans, Americans, and Russians in Shandong cities during the 18th Century. For 20 years prior to the end of World War I, the Germans controlled Shandong. After the defeat of Germany in WWI by the Allied forces, the cities of Chefoo and Tsingtao were handed to the Japanese who used the port cities for their summer fleets. This led to the Shandong Problem which added to the ignition of the May Fourth Movement and the New Culture Movement‚Äî paving the way for the birth of modern China.

It is noted for uses of seafood, vinegar, and garlic. Since Shandong is located in fertile plains, it is a main wheat-growing area in China. People in Shandong enjoy eating foods made of wheat flour as staple food. It is commonly said that Shandong people like to eat big pan-cakes stuffed with scallions or minced meat when they eat three meals a day. Shandong cuisine is generally salty, with a prevalence of light-color sauces, and features adept skill in slicing. Shandong cuisine is representative of Northern Chinese cooking and its techniques have been widely absorbed by the imperial dishes of Ming and Qing Dynasties. Notable dishes * Dezhou Braised (Grilled) Chicken (simplified Chinese: Âæ∑Â∑ûÊâíÈ∏° D√©zh≈çu p√° jƒ´) also known as \\"Dezhou Five-fragrant Boneless Braised Chicken\\" from the city of Dezhou. * Clay Pot Braised Pork Belly (simplified Chinese: ÂùõÂ≠êËÇâ t√°nzi r√≤u) the original Red braised pork belly which has now spread all over China, and is more popularly known as Chairman Mao's favorite dish. Different provinces have different variations of this dish. Tanzi Rou, literally means brewed pork in jar, as the dish is cooked in a porcelain or clay pot. It is said that the dish originated in the Jinan Fengjilou Hotel during the Qing Dynasty. * Eight Immortal Soup a seafood soup popular in overseas Chinese communities. * Fluffy Scallion Pan-Cake (simplified Chinese: Â±±‰∏úÂ§ßÈ•º) is a version of a scallion pancake that is much more dense, fluffier, and thicker than the more widespread southern style, Green-Scallion Oil Pancake. This type of bread can come either plain topped with sesame seeds, or stuffed with meat filling or glass-noodle or eggs and Chinese chives. Different variations exist. * Shandong Fried Oyster * Braised Sea Cucumber with Scallion * Pulled- Caramelized Sweet Potato (simplified Chinese: Êãî‰∏ùÂú∞Áìú b√°sƒ´ d√¨guƒÅ) * Shandong Dumplings Shandong style dumplings are notably plumper and traditionally made with Pork and Cabbage. They are noted for their Gold-nugget like appearance that is accomplished via a particular squeezing technique instead of the more common folding technique. Culture Evidence of the Beixin culture (5300 BC to 4100 BC), the Dawenkou culture (4100 BC to 2600 BC) and the Longshan Culture (3000 BC to 2000 BC) was found in Shandong province, which provides evidence that comparatively advanced handcraft industry, agriculture and animal husbandry was prevalent in Shandong 4000 to 7000 years ago.Liu, Li (2004).

The film's tagline was \\"Behind its forbidden doors an evil secret hides!\\" Plot In swinging London, a group of twenty-something friends are attending a rather dull party, and they decide to gather for kicks at an old, supposedly haunted mansion where one of their number used to play as a child. Among the group is American ringleader Chris, his bored girlfriend Sheila, promiscuous Sylvia (who has her eye on handsome two-timing Gary) and his \\"good girl\\" date, Dorothy. Also tagging along are nervous, heavy-set Madge her sarcastic, hot-tempered boyfriend Peter, sweet- faced Richard and his friend Henry. They are all followed by Paul Kellet, Sylvia's older, jealous and married ex-boyfriend. They have fun exploring the mansion, even holding a s√©ance before separating one by one by candlelight on the moonlit night. Sylvia, frightened by the mansion, leaves and hitchhikes toward home, but Kellet hangs behind at the mansion. While all the partiers are alone, Gary is brutally knifed and his body is discovered by the panic- stricken Dorothy and the others. Because some of them have a criminal record, Chris convinces the group to leave Gary's body far from the home and to pretend that Gary left and that no one knows where he went. They are all shaken by Chris' assertion that one of them must be the murderer. During the next few weeks, the survivors are possessed by tension and guilt, and after Gary is reported missing, they are further shaken by questioning from the police. Kellet confronts Sylvia, learning that she may have lost a lighter that could link them to the mansion. He returns there but is also killed. Dorothy calls the survivors together to ask to confess. However, Chris convinces them to return to the house to discover who among them is the killer before they all succumb to a gruesome death. Meanwhile, Sylvia is visited by the police again, and she discloses the location of the house after learning of Kellet's disappearance. At the mansion, Dorothy becomes hysterical, prompting several of the group to depart, leaving just Chris, Sheila and Richard. While Sheila is out of the room, Richard recounts how he was locked in a basement for three days as a child and tells that he has a paralyzing fear of the dark. Despite Chris' efforts, he is also knifed and Sheila is frantically chased around the mansion. Just as Richard is about to strike, the moon goes behind a cloud, bringing about his reversion to childhood and fear of the dark, thus saving Sheila as the police arrive.

Production Michael Armstrong wrote the screenplay, originally entitled The Dark, in 1960 at the age of 15.\\"Haunted House of Horror script\\" at Michael Armstrong online accessed 13 April 2014 He rewrote the script in 1967, \\"further developing its darker psycho-sexual themes and sharpening characters and dialogue to reflect the current cynical underbelly beneath the superficial Sixties culture.\\" He also added the character of Richard, to be played by David Bowie.\\"Haunted House of Horror screenplay\\" at Michael Armstrong online accessed 13 April 2014 Armstrong showed it to John Trevelyan, who recommended it to Tony Tenser of Tigon Films. Tenser set up the film with American International Pictures (AIP), which wanted it made in England, where it was cheaper to film than in the U.S. AIP insisted that a role be written for Boris Karloff, so Armstrong created the role of a wheelchair-bound detective. However, Karloff was too ill to play the part and Dennis Price took the role instead. AIP also insisted that the two lead characters be played by American actors and that more sex scenes should be added. Armstrong wanted the lead role of Chris to be played by Ian Ogilvy. However, AIP insisted that either Fabian or Frankie Avalon, both of whom were under contract to AIP, play the part. Armstrong wanted Jane Merrow to play the female lead, but Louis Hewyard of AIP wanted Sue Lyon or Carol Lynley. Jill Haworth was eventually cast.\\"Haunted House of Horror Casting\\" at Michael Armstrong Online accessed 13 April 2014 Armstrong originally wrote the part of Richard for Peter McEnery but later rewrote it for David Bowie; he was so keen on Bowie that he wrote a number of cabaret scenes in early drafts specifically for him. However, once Avalon was cast, it was feared that Bowie would clash with him. Bowie was replaced by Noel Janus, but objections led to him being replaced with Julian Barnes (who had originally been cast as Henry).The Haunted House of Horror (1969) at imdb.com Heyward wrote additional scenes for the film, to the dismay of Armstrong. Tenser tried to arrange for both Armstrong's and Heyward's versions to be made, but there was not enough money, so a fourth draft was written that cobbled together all the drafts. Shooting Some exterior scenes where shot at Bank Hall in Bretherton. The interior scenes where shot at the Birkdale Palace Hotel, Southport.\\"Haunted House of Horror Shoot\\" at Michael Armstrong online accessed 13 April 2014 Sam Arkoff and Jack Nicholson of AIP hated the original cut that included Heyward's scenes and requested new scenes. Armstrong wrote the new scenes and handed them to line producer Gerry Levy, but Levy ignored Armstrong's scenes and wrote his own additional material, including a romance between Gina Warwick and a new character played by George Sewell. Levy also added two additional killings, a musical number in the opening scene and a revised closing exposition.\\"Haunted House of Horror post production\\" at Michael Armstrong online accessed 13 April 2014 Armstrong says that among the scenes missing in the final cut of the film were a love story between Gary and Sylvia, \\"twisted sexual meanderings of the characters,\\" satire of the youth scene and a homosexual subplot. Reception Howard Thompson of The New York Times called the film an \\"atrocious hack-'em-up bundle.\\" Variety wrote, \\"As long as he stays in the house, director Michael Armstrong keeps things tense and scary enough, but things look a little silly in the daylight ... All the tension dissipates when the knife-wielding maniac proves just another mixed-up kid rather than anything really spooky. At that, a ghost might have been more believable than Barnes' big scene at the end.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times reviewed the film jointly with The Crimson Cult and found them both to be \\"enjoyable British horror pictures ... that transcend their formula plots through exceptional scripting, efficient direction and intelligent performances.\\"Thomas, Kevin (April 17, 1970). \\"A Double Bill of Shockers\\". Los Angeles Times Part IV, p. 20. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the story \\"strains credulity even for a thriller and is elongated to breaking point,\\" concluding, \\"The shock sequences are reasonably well contrived and there is a liberal flow of blood, but this haunted house is more likely to induce sleep than nightmare.\\" The film's box-office performance was reasonable.

In the 1840s he began purchasing land in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, suspecting it to contain a wealth of coal. When he began mining the area, the town went through an economic boom, and credited Pardee as its founder. Pardee was also a major benefactor of Lafayette College to which he donated over $500,000, and had a building on campus named after him. Early life Pardee was born in Chatham, New York to Ariovistus and Eliza (n√©e Platt), and grew up in nearby Rensselaer County where his father owned a farm. Pardee was taught by his father while working on the farm and received some formal education in engineering from a schoolhouse in town run by the Presbyterian minister, Moses Hunter. Career In 1829, Pardee left New York to work as a rodman (or surveyor's assistant) on the construction of the Delaware and Raritan Canal. One of the key purposes of this canal was to move anthracite coal out from the mountains to be processed in factories in New Jersey. Pardee often referred to this job as the key turning point in his life. After the completion of the canal, Pardee was sent to the Beaver Meadow Railroad Company to survey and find a location for the company's railroad which would be used for the shipment of coal. While there, he realized the potential earnings in the anthracite industry if it were connected to railways, rather than canals. After a brief trip to Michigan, where his parents had relocated to, Pardee settled down in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. Here, he signed on with the Hazleton Railroad and Coal Company as a superintendent. In 1840, Pardee began buying land in Hazleton, believing it to contain more coal than its current operators realized. He formed his own coal mining company with business partner John Gillingham Fell, who would later go on to become the president of the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The land Pardee purchased turned out to sit on an incredibly valuable vein of anthracite, and the company began setting up mines to extract the valuable coal. In 1848, Pardee built a gravity railroad to ship his coal, which was later connected to the greater Lehigh Valley railroad. The effect of this new industry transformed Hazleton from a cluster of houses to a populated town, and Pardee personally helped found many banks, churches, schools, and libraries, thus being credited as the founder of Hazleton. Pardee diversified his interests following the success of anthracite mining and by 1888 was engaged in iron manufacture, operating blast furnaces in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Tennessee. During the American Civil War, Pardee funded a military company in which his son, Ario Pardee Jr. served.Jacobus, p. 372 The company was known as the \\"Pardee Rifles\\". Pardee Jr. would later earn valor at the Battle of Gettysburg, and a monument at the battleground now commemorates \\"Pardee Field\\". Lafayette College Pardee Hall on the Lafayette College campus With the onset of the Civil War, Lafayette College saw a drastic reduction in its student population and was nearing bankruptcy. Reverend William Cassady Cattell was called in as the college's new president, tasked with finding endowments to keep the college, on the verge of closing, alive. In 1864, Cattell visited Hazleton at the invitation of Pardee to deliver a sermon, and afterwards Cattell explained to Pardee the financial situation the college was in.Skillman, vol. 1, pp. 265‚Äì268 That same day Pardee gave a gift of $20,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars), for the school's use, which was at the time the largest sum ever given to an educational institution in Pennsylvania. Without this gift the college would have faced certain closure.Skillman, vol. 1, p. 267 Pardee, now a director for the Lehigh Valley Railroad as well as a coal magnate, realized the need for trained engineers in the railroad and mining industries and went back to Lafayette in 1865 with a proposal to fund the college's scientific course.Skillman, vol. 1, p. 278 With another gift, this time of $100,000, the \\"Pardee Scientific Course\\" was created, and the college began issuing engineering degrees for the first time.Skillman, vol. 1, pp. 281‚Äì282 Shortly after its creation, the college realized the need for a new building on campus to house its growing scientific program and Pardee made another gift of $250,000 to construct this new building.Skillman, vol. 1, pp. 341‚Äì343 An additional gift of $50,000 was given for equipment for the science program. This building, dedicated as \\"Pardee Hall\\", opened in 1873 and was regarded as \\"the largest and most complete scientific college building in the United States.\\" In 1879, the building burned down but was rebuilt with the same appearance by the end of 1880.Skillman, vol. 2, p. 20 The building was burned down again in an act of arson in 1897, but was again rebuilt by 1899.Skillman, vol. 2, pp. 143‚Äì144 Pardee was a member of the Board of Trustees to Lafayette College for 27 years, and also served as its president from 1881 to 1892.Skillman, vol. 2, p. 316 His total donations to the school at the time of his death reached the sum of $522,883 (equivalent to $ in dollars).Skillman, vol. 2, pp. 87‚Äì88 Personal life Pardee married Elizabeth Jacobs in 1838,Jacobus, p. 367 with whom he had four children: Ario, Calvin, Alice, and Ellen. A fifth child was conceived but died in childbirth in 1847 along with Elizabeth. Now a widower with four young children, Pardee hired a governess, Anna Maria Robison, to help him raise his children. They married in 1848 and had nine children: William, Israel, Anna, Barton, Frank, Bessie, Edith, Robert, and Gertrude. Israel, his second child with Anna Maria, was a twin, but the other child died during birth.Jacobus, p. 373 Pardee died on March 26, 1892 in Rockledge, Florida. His funeral service was given by William Cassady Cattell.

Overview The QPACE supercomputer is a research project carried out by several academic institutions in collaboration with the IBM Research and Development Laboratory in B√∂blingen, Germany, and other industrial partners including Eurotech, Kn√ºrr, and Xilinx. The academic design team of about 20 junior and senior scientists, mostly physicists, came from the University of Regensburg (project lead), the University of Wuppertal, DESY Zeuthen, J√ºlich Research Centre, and the University of Ferrara. The main goal was the design of an application-optimized scalable architecture that beats industrial products in terms of compute performance, price-performance ratio, and energy efficiency. The project officially started in 2008. Two installations were deployed in the summer of 2009. The final design was completed in early 2010. Since then QPACE is used for calculations of lattice QCD. The system architecture is also suitable for other applications that mainly rely on nearest-neighbor communication, e.g., lattice Boltzmann methods. In November 2009 QPACE was the leading architecture on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world. The title was defended in June 2010, when the architecture achieved an energy signature of 773 MFLOPS per Watt in the Linpack benchmark. In the Top500 list of most powerful supercomputers, QPACE ranked #110-#112 in November 2009, and #131-#133 in June 2010. QPACE was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in the framework of SFB/TRR-55 and by IBM. Additional contributions were made by Eurotech, Kn√ºrr, and Xilinx. Architecture In 2008 IBM released the PowerXCell 8i multi-core processor, an enhanced version of the IBM Cell Broadband Engine used, e.g., in the PlayStation 3. The processor received much attention in the scientific community due to its outstanding floating-point performance. It is one of the building blocks of the IBM Roadrunner cluster, which was the first supercomputer architecture to break the PFLOPS barrier. Cluster architectures based on the PowerXCell 8i typically rely on IBM blade servers interconnected by industry-standard networks such as Infiniband. For QPACE an entirely different approach was chosen. A custom-designed network co- processor implemented on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGAs is used to connect the compute nodes. FPGAs are re-programmable semiconductor devices that allow for a customized specification of the functional behavior. The QPACE network processor is tightly coupled to the PowerXCell 8i via a Rambus-proprietary I/O interface. The smallest building block of QPACE is the node card, which hosts the PowerXCell 8i and the FPGA. Node cards are mounted on backplanes, each of which can host up to 32 node cards. One QPACE rack houses up to eight backplanes, with four backplanes each mounted to the front and back side. The maximum number of node cards per rack is 256. QPACE relies on a water-cooling solution to achieve this packaging density. Sixteen node cards are monitored and controlled by a separate administration card, called the root card. One more administration card per rack, called the superroot card, is used to monitor and control the power supplies. The root cards and superroot cards are also used for synchronization of the compute nodes. Node card The heart of QPACE is the IBM PowerXCell 8i multi-core processor. Each node card hosts one PowerXCell 8i, 4 GB of DDR2 SDRAM with ECC, one Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA and seven network transceivers. A single 1 Gigabit Ethernet transceiver connects the node card to the I/O network. Six 10 Gigabit transceivers are used for passing messages between neighboring nodes in a three-dimensional toroidal mesh. The QPACE network co-processor is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA, which is directly connected to the I/O interface of the PowerXCell 8i. The functional behavior of the FPGA is defined by a hardware description language and can be changed at any time at the cost of rebooting the node card. Most entities of the QPACE network co-coprocessor are coded in VHDL. Networks The QPACE network co-processor connects the PowerXCell 8i to three communications networks: * The torus network is a high-speed communication path that allows for nearest-neighbor communication in a three-dimensional toroidal mesh. The torus network relies on the physical layer of 10 Gigabit Ethernet, while a custom-designed communications protocol optimized for small message sizes is used for message passing. A unique feature of the torus network design is the support for zero-copy communication between the private memory areas, called the Local Stores, of the Synergistic Processing Elements (SPEs) by direct memory access. The latency for communication between two SPEs on neighboring nodes is 3 Œºs. The peak bandwidth per link and direction is about 1 GB/s. * Switched 1 Gigabit Ethernet is used for file I/O and maintenance. * The global signals network is a simple 2-wire system arranged as a tree network. This network is used for evaluation of global conditions and synchronization of the nodes. Cooling The compute nodes of the QPACE supercomputer are cooled by water. Roughly 115 Watt have to be dissipated from each node card. The cooling solution is based on a two-component design. Each node card is mounted to a thermal box, which acts as a large heat sink for heat-critical components. The thermal box interfaces to a coldplate, which is connected to the water-cooling circuit. The performance of the coldplate allows for the removal of the heat from up to 32 nodes. The node cards are mounted on both sides of the coldplate, i.e., 16 nodes each are mounted on the top and bottom of the coldplate. The efficiency of the cooling solution allows for the cooling of the compute nodes with warm water. The QPACE cooling solution also influenced other supercomputer designs such as SuperMUC. Installations Two identical installations of QPACE with four racks have been operating since 2009: * J√ºlich Research Centre * University of Wuppertal The aggregate peak performance is about 200 TFLOPS in double precision, and 400 TFLOPS in single precision. The installations are operated by the University of Regensburg, J√ºlich Research Centre, and the University of Wuppertal.

The Collaborative is dedicated to advancing team-based, comprehensive primary care in partnership with patients and their families and serves as a broad-based national advocacy organization for the primary care patient centered medical home, providing information and networking opportunities to facilitate support for the PCMH. They are headquartered in downtown Washington, D.C. History The Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative was created in late 2006, when several large national employers came together with the four major U.S. primary care physician associations in order to: #Advance an effective and efficient health system built on a strong foundation of primary care and the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) #Facilitate improvements in patient-physician relations #Create a more effective and efficient model of healthcare delivery To achieve these goals, the PCPCC has created an open forum where healthcare stakeholders freely communicate and work together to improve the future of the American medical system. The Collaborative has developed model language for inclusion in health reform proposals to include the PCMH concept. It also acts as a key source for the continued education of congressional representatives, the federal and state governments, and individual practices on the PCMH model as a superior form of healthcare delivery. Activities Having achieved significant success in getting the PCMH included as a foundational model of care in national and state-level health care reform efforts as well as in the commercial health insurance market, the Collaborative is now working with partners to obtain full-scale implementation so all patients and families can receive care in a PCMH. In order to realize this vision for modern, robust primary care services, the Collaborative is working to: *Disseminate expert opinion, resources, and tools to assist clinicians in transforming their primary care setting into a PCMH *Educate policy makers, consumers, health care advocates, employers, purchasers, and payers on the benefits of receiving care in a PCMH *Share evidence and outcomes of the PCMH that demonstrate improved quality, lower costs, and increased efficiencies in care *Advocate for policies and payment models necessary to implement and sustain PCMHs in the community *Disseminate information about implementation of promising PCMH initiatives In addition to the work of the PCPCC, the Patient-Centered Primary Care Foundation (PCPCF) currently engages in education of the PCMH model through public conferences, webinars, policy papers, guides, and toolkits. Member Organizations Today, PCPCC's membership represents more than 1,200 stakeholder organizations and 50 million health care consumers throughout the U.S. split into two different tiers of membership. Executive Committee Members The PCPCC's Executive Committee is a valuable group of members that provide leadership and work in partnership with PCPCC's Board of Directors and staff. Members represent a range of health care stakeholders, including health professional associations, employers, purchasers, health plans, health systems, pharmaceutical firms, professional associations and quality improvement organizations. Member benefits include access to exclusive leadership roles, events and organizational initiatives. Each member contributes annual dues that support the development of educational tools, publications and conferences. General Members The Collaborative's general public membership is free of charge and includes many benefits. General members are invited to join the Collaborative's national weekly call and receive monthly updates on the work of the five Centers. Members also have free access to many Collaborative resources.

The game typically consists of two teams of even numbers, one on each side of a table, and four cups set up on each side. The cups are lined up in a straight line representing the bases with the last cup at the edge of the table. When a ball lands in a cup, the defending team must consume all of the beer inside that cup and all the cups below it, e.g. if the third cup is hit (a triple), the third, second and first cup are consumed. The cups are filled according to their position on the table. The cup closest to the opposing team is 1/4 full, the second cup is 1/2 full, the third cup is 3/4 full and the final cup nearest the edge is full. It is also common to have a glass of water with the purpose of cleaning the ball between throws. After consumption the cup is refilled to the appropriate level and placed back on the table. The game consists of nine innings in which each team gets to \\"bat\\"; if a ball is thrown and does not hit or land in a cup this is an out; each team gets three outs per inning. The team with the greatest score after nine innings is considered the winner. Variation: the game can be played using \\"little league\\" rules in which the game is over after six innings. Variation: if a ball is thrown and hits a cup it may be caught by \\"fielders\\" prior to touching the table or floor for an out. Setup Fourteen cups are needed, seven for each team, four representing the bases, then three on each side of the table representing bases for baserunners. The four cups representing the bases are lined up in a straight line with the last cup at the edge of the table. The cups for flip cup are placed near the center of the table so that judging who won the flip cup can be done easily. Teams Baseball is usually played with two teams of even numbers, though it can be played by an odd number so long as the relative drinking/playing strengths are even. Each team begins with two captains who pick their team in an alternating fashion. The captain who picks second then chooses whether to be home (shoot second) or away (shoot first.) Playing field The game is typically played on either a ping pong table or a folding banquet table. In general, this will be a plywood board cut to proper size, sometimes painted with sports, school, or fraternity symbols and given a liquid-proof coating. Equipment The most common cups used are 16-ounce disposable plastic cups with ridge-lines which can be used precisely to measure the amount of beer to be poured into the cup.Non-alcoholic beer- pong game system - Patent 20040188942 38 mm or 40 mm table tennis (ping pong) balls are typically used for game play.Portable cooler and table - Patent 20060065665 Alcohol Usually an inexpensive light beer is used because of the large quantities of beer which may be consumed during the course of several games. Game play Game play proceeds much like a game of beer pong. The team that is up shoots the ball until they accumulate three outs, via getting 3 strikes (by missing the cups), being caught out (which can occur when a ball bounces off a cup and the opposing team catches it), or being thrown out stealing. At this point the other team begins to shoot. After nine innings the score is calculated and the team with more runs wins. AT BAT: Four cups are arranged so that the farthest cup is touching the far edge of the table. The cups are arranged vertically and touching so that each cup is one cup's diameter closer to the person \\"at bat.\\" The cups are filled with beer so that the \\"single cup\\" (being the cup closest to the batter) is filled 1/4 of the way. The \\"double cup\\" is filled to half. The \\"triple cup\\" is filled to 3/4, and the \\"home run cup\\" is filled all the way. If a player lands the ball in a cup the opposing team must consume that cup and all cups below it, e.g. the second cup is hit (a double) so the second and first cup are consumed. The cups are refilled to the appropriate line and placed back in formation. Each player gets three attempts (strikes) to get a hit (make the ball in one of those cups). A miss ('hitting a cup without an opposing team member catching it') is considered a strike. The opposing team can field the batter out by catching a foul ball (as described above). If the player misses all the cups during any shot in the at bat it is considered an out. If a person shoots out of order just like in baseball if caught the shooter is not out but the person that was skipped is out. BASE RUNNING: When a player makes a cup they are said to be on base. Three cups must be set up as bases: The \\"first base\\" cup must be filled 1/2 of the way full; the \\"second base\\" cup is to be filled 3/4 full; the \\"third base\\" cup is full. A designated \\"catcher\\" from the fielding team must also have a cup that is filled to 1/3. A base runner advances to the base corresponding to his at bat. A single puts him on first base, a double onto second base, etc. There are two ways to advance a runner: the runner can advance by the at bat player hitting the ball (which moves him the corresponding number of bases) or by stealing. BASE STEALING: This means they are now playing flip cup against a person from the other team, a catcher. If the person on base wishes to advance (steal) they begin to play single cup flip cup. If the person on base wins they advance, if they lose they are thrown out, and are off the bases and an out is recorded. The person attempting to steal must not try to steal until the opposing team has set and refilled their cups, an attempt to steal before this is done is considered void and must be sent back to the original base. If the catcher lifts up their cup before the base runner lifts up their cup this is a balk and the base runner advances one base. DEFENDING: If a player throws a ball that hits a cup and the opposing team catches it, it is an out. Should a player throw an airball (the ball touches no cups), it is considered an 'out' The person catching must rotate by inning and no one can catch a second time until everyone has caught once. All catches must be made using the players off-hand (the hand that glove would be worn on during a real game of baseball). All catches must be made cleanly without trapping the ball against the body or letting the ball hit the floor. ALTERNATE RULES: An alternate set of rules (known as \\"Man Lodge Rules\\") exists to make the game higher scoring, feel more similar to actual baseball, and make home runs more rewarding. In Man Lodge rules the gameplay is similar except: 1) Missing all cups but still hitting the table is counted as a strike, as opposed to an out 2) Bouncing the ball off a cup is treated as a foul ball, and if caught in the air is an out, if not it is counted as a strike (similar to actual baseball) 3) Missing the table entirely ALWAYS constitutes an out, whether or not the defense catches it 4) Each cup is filled halfway, once a cup is made you pull that cup and drink its contents, with the exception of a home run, in the event of a home run all remaining cups are consumed, and all cups are replaced. 5) If a player makes a \\"base\\" cup a player is currently drinking (similar to a \\"death cup\\" in beer pong) that is considered a \\"Grand Slam\\" - drink remaining cups and count 4 runs scored 6) All players on the defending team are active. A single defender is in the middle and, in the case of a foul ball, must hit the ball up after the ball bounces off a cup for a teammate to catch for it to be an out. If a defender catches the ball before it is hit up by the middle player, or they fail to catch it, then it is simply a foul ball. ALTERNATE RULES: An alternate set of rules (known as \\"Hoover Rules\\") exists to make the game more challenging for more experienced players. 1) Any member of the team can catch the ball for an out with either or both hands. 2) The 'Home-run' cup is placed on an island at the back of the table away from the other three cups. 3) There is only one 'steal' cup which acts as a steal for the leading base runner. If the base-runner is stealing home, then the player stealing must flip the cup successfully twice, while the defender must only flip the cup once to throw the runner out. Additionally, any member from the opposing team may 'throw' the stealing player out. In this rule variation, there is no designated 'catcher'.

He played for Northwestern State from 2008‚Äì09 through 2011‚Äì12. He is best known for leading NCAA Division I in blocks as a junior in 2010‚Äì11. Mosley recorded a school single season record 156 blocks in 32 games player for an average of 4.9 per game. He graduated after 2011‚Äì12 as the fifth most prolific shot blocker in NCAA history after having accumulated 456 career blocks. Early life Mosley was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. He attended Huntington High School from 2003‚Äì04 to 2006‚Äì07, and as a senior he was named Second-team All-District 1-5A on a team that finished with a 34‚Äì6 overall record. The Raiders, as the team was known, was the second-ranked team in Louisiana's Class 5A. During his final high school season, Mosley averaged 9.2 points, 11.3 rebounds 5.2 blocks per game. College Mosley stayed in his home state to play college basketball, although his collegiate career did not begin until 2008‚Äì09. That season, he ranked fourth nationally in rebounds per game (8.5) among freshmen and second in blocks per game (2.5). His 76 blocked shots placed him 10th all-time in Northwestern State University history while also ranking him second in single season totals. The following year, his sophomore campaign, Mosley led the Southland Conference with 3.4 blocks per game. He recorded career highs of eight blocks and 21 rebounds en route to being named an Honorable Mention All-Conference selection. In 2010‚Äì11, Mosley increased his statistical averages in most categories, most noticeably in blocks per game. He played in three more games than the year before but also increased his average by 1.5 blocks per game, and Mosley's 4.9 topped NCAA Division I. He had entered his junior year having already amassed 174 career blocks and needing 29 to become the school's all-time leader. After recording 156 during his junior year, and still having one full season left to play, Mosley has entered his senior season in 2011‚Äì12 as the school record holder by 127 blocks. When his college career ended following the 2011‚Äì12 season he had recorded 456 blocks. This total placed him fifth all-time on the NCAA Division I men's basketball career blocks leaderboard. Professional career On July 16, 2016, Mosley signed with Italian club Legnano Knights. On August 2, 2018, Mosley signed a deal with the Italian club Pallacanestro Trieste for the LBA. On July 23, 2019, Mosley signed a one-year deal for Serbian team Partizan. On February 21, 2020, he signed a three-year deal with Partizan. Personal life Infant twin sons' deaths On March 3, 2012, Mosley's two infant twin sons, Jayden and Kayden Mosley, died after spending their entire lives in a hospital due to respiratory issues. The twins were born on March 20, 2011, and there was no apparent threat prior to their deaths.

In 2009, Christakis was named to the Time 100, Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2009 and again in 2010, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of top global thinkers. As of 2020, he has published three books. Early life Christakis' parents are Greek. They had three biological children and then adopted two others, an African-American girl and a Chinese boy. His father was a nuclear physicist turned business consultant and his mother a physical chemist turned psychologist. He was born in New Haven, Connecticut in 1962 when both his parents were Yale University graduate students. His family returned to Greece when he was three, and Greek became his first language. He returned to the United States with his family at the age of six and grew up in Washington, D.C. He graduated from St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.). Education Christakis obtained a B.S. degree in biology from Yale University in 1984, where he won the Russell Henry Chittenden Prize. He received an M.D. degree from Harvard Medical School and an M.P.H. degree from the Harvard School of Public Health in 1989, winning the Bowdoin Prize on graduation. In 1991, Christakis completed a residency in Internal Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. He was certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine in 1993. He obtained a Ph.D. degree in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1995. While at the University of Pennsylvania as a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar, he studied with Renee C. Fox, a distinguished American medical sociologist; other members of his dissertation committee were methodologist Paul Allison and physician Sankey Williams. In his dissertation, which was published as Death Foretold, Christakis studied the role of prognosis in medical thought and practice, documenting and explaining how physicians are socialized to avoid making prognoses.[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E7DA163DF93BA15752C1A9669C8B63&sec;=&spon;=&emc;=eta1 Gina Kolata, \\"A Conversation with: Nicholas Christakis; A Doctor With a Cause: 'What's My Prognosis?'\\", The New York Times, November 28, 2000. He argued that the prognoses patients receive, even from the best-trained American doctors, are driven not only by professional norms but also by religious, moral, and even quasi-magical beliefs (such as the \\"self-fulfilling prophecy\\"). Career In 1995, Christakis started as an Assistant Professor with joint appointments in the Departments of Sociology and Medicine at the University of Chicago. In 2001, he was awarded tenure in both Sociology and Medicine. He left the University of Chicago to take up a position at Harvard in 2001. Until July 2013, he was a Professor of Medical Sociology in the Department of Health Care Policy and a Professor of Medicine in the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School; a Professor of Sociology in the Department of Sociology in the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences; and an Attending Physician at the Harvard-affiliated Mt. Auburn Hospital. In 2013, Christakis moved to Yale University, where he is a Professor of Social and Natural Science in the Department of Sociology, with additional appointments in the Departments of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; Statistics and Data Science; Biomedical Engineering; Medicine; and in the School of Management. He served as the Sol Goldman Family Professor of Social and Natural Science until 2018, when he was appointed as a Sterling Professor, the highest honor bestowed on Yale faculty. From 2009 to 2013, Christakis and his wife, Erika Christakis, were Co-Masters of Pforzheimer House, one of Harvard's twelve residential houses.Bita M. Asad and Ahmed Mabruk, \\"Christakises To Be Pfoho House Masters,\\" The Harvard Crimson, February 17, 2009. From 2015 to 2016, he served in a similar capacity at Silliman College at Yale University.Emma Platoff and Victor Wang, \\"Christakis named Silliman master,\\" Yale News, February 27, 2015. Research Christakis uses quantitative methods (e.g., mathematical models, statistical analyses, and experiments). His work focuses on network science and biosocial science, and it has also involved evolutionary biology, evolutionary psychology, behavior genetics, epidemiology, demography, and sociology. He is an author or editor of five books, more than 180 peer- reviewed academic articles, numerous editorials in national and international publications, and at least three patents. His laboratory is also active in the development and release of software to conduct experiments and other studies (e.g., Breadboard, Trellis). Studies by Christakis and James H. Fowler, beginning in 2007, suggested that a variety of attributes like obesity, smoking, and happiness, rather than being solely individualistic, also arise via social contagion mechanisms over some distance within social networks (see: \\"three degrees of influence\\"). Other work in the Christakis and Fowler labs has used experimental methods to study social networks, and has broadened to use many data sets and approaches. In 2010, they demonstrated, using an experiment, that cooperative behavior could spread to three degrees of separation. In a TED talk, Christakis summarizes the broader implications of the role of networks in human activity. In 2009, his group extended the study of social networks to genetics, publishing in PNAS: Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences a finding that social network position may be partially heritable, and specifically that an increase in twins' shared genetic material corresponds to differences in their social networks. In 2011, Fowler and Christakis published a follow-up paper on \\"Correlated Genotypes in Friendship Networks\\" in PNAS, advancing the argument that humans may be \\"metagenomic\\" with respect to the people around them. Further work on this topic included \\"Friendship and Natural Selection\\" in PNAS in 2014. In 2012, in a paper in Nature, the group analyzed the social networks of the Hadza hunter gatherers, showing that human social network structure appears to have ancient origins. Christakis and his colleagues did similar work mapping the networks of the Nyangatom people in 2016. His group has also demonstrated that social networks are deeply related to human cooperation. These ideas are explored in his 2019 book, Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society. In 2010, Christakis and Fowler published a paper (based on the spread of H1N1 at Harvard University in 2009) regarding the use of social networks as 'sensors' for forecasting epidemics (of germs and other phenomena). In another TED talk, Christakis describes this effort (and computational social science more generally). A follow-up paper in 2014 documented the utility of this approach to forecast trends, again based on the \\"friendship paradox,\\" using Twitter data. Beginning in 2010, Christakis and his colleagues initiated a program of research to deploy social networks to improve health and other social phenomena‚Äîfor example, facilitating the adoption of public health innovations in the developing world (published in 2015), or demonstrating the utility of autonomous agents (Artificial Intelligence \\"bots\\") in optimizing coordination in groups online (published in 2017). The 2017 Nature paper on bots initiated a program of work on \\"hybrid systems\\" composed of humans and machines (endowed with AI) that reshape how humans interact not with the machines, but with each other. A paper published in 2020 in PNAS extended this idea by showing that physical robots could modify conversations among people interacting in groups. Another paper that year showed that simply programmed bots could re-engineer social connections among humans in networked groups in order to make them become more cooperative. Christakis has argued that \\"the effects of AI on human-to-human interaction stand to be intense and far-reaching, and the advances rapid and broad, we must investigate systematically what second-order effects might emerge, and discuss how to regulate them on behalf of the common good.\\" Christakis' lab has been supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), by the Pioneer Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and by other funders. In 2019, his lab received support to extend their work to studies of the human microbiota from the Nomis Foundation. Physician Christakis has practiced as a home hospice physician and in consultative palliative medicine. He took care of indigent, home-bound, dying patients in the South Side of Chicago while at the University of Chicago, in the period from 1995‚Äì2001. During this time, he was also active in translating research results into national policy changes with respect to end-of-life care in the USA; for instance, he testified before the US Senate Special Committee on Aging in 2000 (regarding barriers to hospice use, prognostication, and the cost-effectiveness of hospice). In Boston, from 2002 to 2006, Christakis worked as an attending physician on the Palliative Medicine Consult Service at Massachusetts General Hospital. In 2006, he moved to Mount Auburn Hospital. In 2013, he moved to the Department of Medicine at Yale University.  Writings  Christakis' first book, Death Foretold: Prophecy and Prognosis in Medical Care, was published by the University of Chicago Press in 1999, and has been translated into Japanese. His second book, Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives, was co-authored with James Fowler and appeared in September 2009. It was awarded the \\"Books for a Better Life\\" Award in 2009 and has been translated into 20 languages. Connected draws on previously published and unpublished studies and makes several new conclusions about the influence of social networks on human health and behavior. In Connected, Christakis and Fowler put forward their \\"three degrees of influence\\" rule, which theorizes that each person's social influence can stretch to roughly three degrees of separation (to the friend of a friend of a friend) before it fades out.Clive Tomson, \\"Is Happiness Catching,\\" The New York Times, September 14, 2009. Christakis' third book, Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society, was published by Little, Brown Spark in March 2019. It made the New York Times Best Seller list in its debut week. It was widely and favorably reviewed. For instance, Bill Gates described the book as \\"optimistic and terrific.\\" Blueprint explores the idea that evolution has given humans a suite of beneficial capacities, including love, friendship, cooperation, and learning; humans have innate proclivities to make a good society, one that is similar worldwide. ‚ÄúFor too long,‚Äù Christakis writes, ‚Äúthe scientific community has been overly focused on the dark side of our biological heritage: our capacity for tribalism, violence, selfishness, and cruelty. The bright side has been denied the attention it deserves.‚Äù Christakis' fourth book, Apollo's Arrow: The Profound and Enduring Impact of Coronavirus on the Way We Live, will be published by Little, Brown Spark in October, 2020. Christakis has also co-edited two clinical textbooks on end-of- life care, published by Oxford University Press.P. Glare and N.A. Christakis, eds., Prognosis in Advanced Cancer, Oxford University Press, 2008 G. Hanks, N. Cherny, S. Kassa, R. Portenoy, N.A. Christakis, and M. Fallon, eds., Oxford Textbook of Palliative Medicine, 4th ed., Oxford University Press, 2009 Free speech advocacy While both at Harvard University and at Yale University, Christakis was involved in the defense of free expression. At Harvard, in 2012, he and his wife, Erika Christakis, came to the defense of minority students who were using satire to criticize the elite final clubs at that institution. They suggested that the critics might be \\"more concerned with ugly words than the underlying problems\\" and that policing free expression on campus \\"denies students the opportunity to learn to think for themselves.\\" Their argument expressed confidence in the capacity and maturity of Harvard students to discuss contentious issues. At Yale, in 2015, they were involved in a controversy related to the regulation of Halloween costumes. On October 29, 2015, Christakis' wife Erika Christakis, a Lecturer on Early Childhood Education at the Yale Child Study Center, wrote an e-mail to Yale undergraduates on the role of free expression in universities; she argued, from a developmental perspective, that students might wish to consider whether administrators should provide guidance on Halloween attire or whether students might wish to be allowed to \\"dress themselves.\\" This e-mail was in response to a long earlier e-mail sent to undergraduates by a group of 14 administrators at Yale which suggested students be careful when choosing Halloween costumes, and which provided links to recommended and non-recommended costumes. The e-mail played a role in protests on campus that received national attention in the United States. Christakis and his wife were criticized by some students for placing \\"the burden of confrontation, education, and maturity on the offended.\\" But other students pointed out that Erika Christakis was defending the rights to free expression of all Yale students and expressing confidence in them and in their capacity to discuss and confront such issues among themselves. Ninety-one Yale faculty members signed a letter supporting the Christakises, and this letter noted that the Christakises themselves distinguished support for freedom of expression from supporting the content of such expression (they had noted that they would find many of the same costumes offensive as some students would). Despite Christakis' belief that Yale students could discuss controversial issues (such as costumes) among themselves, and his confidence in their ability to do so, he stepped down from his role at Silliman College eight months later, at the end of the academic year, a step The Atlantic later decried (noting \\"When Yale‚Äôs history is written, they should be regarded as collateral damage harmed by people who abstracted away their humanity\\"). In a subsequent Op-Ed in The New York Times (his only published comment on the events), Christakis argued: \\"Open, extended conversations among students themselves are essential not only to the pursuit of truth but also to deep moral learning and to righteous social progress.\\" A year later, commentators condemned how students, administrators, and faculty had behaved at Yale (and linked to substantial video footage of the events). In her only published remarks regarding what happened, a year later in October 2016, Erika Christakis described the circumstances (including threats) that she had faced in an Op-Ed published in The Washington Post. The incident led to some students being called members of \\"Generation Snowflake\\".Fox, Claire (2016) \\"I find that offensive\\", Biteback. In January 2016, Bill Maher expressed consternation at how the Yale students had behaved. In April 2017, an episode of The Simpsons titled \\"Caper Chase\\" satirized the events, with one character saying: \\"We also need to hire more deans to decide which Halloween costumes are appropriate.\\" Also in 2017, a short documentary was released about the episode, arguing that they reflected a collision between \\"old values\\" centered on reason and debate, on the one hand, and \\"administrative bloat\\" and a shift to a \\"consumer mentality\\" on the other (this documentary also noted that Christakis comes from a multi-racial family and has African- American and Chinese siblings). The New York Times published a coda regarding the episode in August 2018, upon Christakis' appointment as a Sterling Professor, Yale's highest faculty rank, in which Christakis noted that he \\"was eager to make himself useful to Yale's mission.\\" The 2015 occurrences at Yale have been discussed in at least 20 non-fiction books.    Blackford provides a very precise and comprehensive timeline. Some of these books noted the \\"sexism\\" and \\"irony\\" that, in a key episode that was part of the events (when Christakis was surrounded by 150 students in a quad for two hours), the students wished to hold Christakis responsible for his wife's email.Fox, 2017Ben-Porath, 2017 Murray summarizes statements by students based on his review of extensive video footage released by the students themselves of the events in the quad, and he notes Christakis' emphasis on \\"our common humanity.\\" Many of the books have expressed concern at the \\"illiberal\\" actions of the students (and of many administrators and faculty) at Yale. The behavior of the students also sparked a minor controversy at Harvard Law School when a student there wrote a piece decrying the Christakis' treatment as \\"fascism\\" in the Harvard Law Record; criticized for publishing the piece, the Record's liberal editor-in-chief wrote that his role was \\"editor-in-chief, not thought-policeman-in-chief.\\" Christakis has spoken publicly about the events only rarely. In an October 2017 interview with Sam Harris, he discussed parts of the situation he faced, framing the events at Yale in the broader context of what was happening on many campuses during that time period; Harris noted that Christakis had \\"the imperturbability of a saint.\\" In March 2019, Christakis told Frank Bruni that, partly in response to the events, he worked to complete a long-standing book project on the origins of goodness in society. In April of 2020, Christakis expressed concern that, in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals and medical schools were seeking to silence faculty and staff who were highlighting problems with the response; he stated that ‚Äúclamping down on people who are speaking is a kind of idiocy of the highest order.\\" Personal Christakis resides in Norwich, Vermont. He is married to early childhood educator and author Erika Christakis and they have four children, one of whom they adopted later in life, while serving as foster parents. His hobbies have included Shotokan karate (his instructor, Kazumi Tabata, mentions him)Tabata, Kazumi, Warrior Wisdom, Tuttle publishing, 2013, and making maple syrup.

It was an unusual pod-and-boom design, with the empennage carried on two open truss structures that extended aft from the wings, similar to the arrangement used on the S.55. The powerplant was mounted on a set of cabane struts above the wing, and consisted of a single engine driving a pusher propeller. The cockpit was located inside the stubby fuselage pod and was fully enclosed. The S.64 made its first flight on 3 April 1928 with Alessandro Passeleva at the controls.  Record flights  On 31 May 1928, Arturo Ferrarin and Carlo Del Prete broke three world records in the S.64 by making 51 round trips between Torre Flavia (in Ladispoli) and Anzio. When they landed on 3 June, they had covered 7,666 km (4,791 mi) ‚Äì a new world distance record over a closed circuit ‚Äì and stayed aloft for 58 hours 34 minutes ‚Äì a new world endurance record. Moreover, they also set the world record for top speed over a distance of 5,000 km (3,110 mi) of 139 km/h (87 mph). With the record attempt successfully concluded, an announcement was made that this was to be a proving exercise for a Rome‚ÄìNew York City transatlantic flight. The following month Ferrarin and Del Prete did indeed cross the Atlantic in the S.64, not to New York, but across the South Atlantic to Brazil. Departing Montecelio on the evening of 3 July, they flew over Sardinia overnight, and then Gibraltar early the next morning. During 4 July their course covered Casablanca and Villa Cisneros, and by that evening they were over the Cape Verde islands and headed for Brazil. On the morning of 5 July, they were within radio range of Pernambuco. Crossing the Brazilian coast near Natal, they continued south, hoping to reach Rio de Janeiro. However, poor weather forced the aviators to turn back towards Natal. Now running low on fuel and with the weather still against them, they were forced to abandon landing there as well, since the aerodrome lay behind a row of hills. Instead, they continued north for another 160 km (100 mi) and made a forced landing on a beach at Touros. A Brazilian mail plane conveyed Ferrarin and Del Prete first to Natal and then to Rio de Janeiro, where in both cities they were given a heroes' welcome. The S.64 suffered structural damage during its landing on the sand, and was brought to Rio de Janeiro by ship. When it arrived in the city, it was donated to Brazil. During the flight from Italy, the S.64 had covered 8,100 km (5,030 mi) in 48 hours, 14 minutes. The FAI officially recognised this as a flight of 7,188 km (4,500 mi) ‚Äì the orthodromic distance between Montecelio and Natal ‚Äì and a new world straight-line distance record. The festivities in Rio de Janeiro continued for weeks, but came to an end when Ferrarin and Del Prete crashed during a demonstration flight in a S.62 on 11 August. Del Prete died from his injuries five days later. In 1930, a second, improved S.64, designated the S.64bis, set out to reconquer the duration and closed-circuit distance records that been broken since Ferrarin and Del Prete's flight. Between 30 May and 2 June, Umberto Maddalena and Fausto Cecconi flew from Montecelio in a closed circuit and covered 8,188 km (5,088 mi) in 67 hours 14 minutes, establishing new distance and duration records. They were preparing to again contest the endurance record in the S.64 when the aircraft crashed into the sea off Pisa on 19 March 1931. Maddalena and Cecconi were both killed, along with their mechanic, Giuseppe Da Monte. The wreckage was too widely dispersed for the cause of the accident to be determined with any certainty, but the Commission of Inquiry suspected that the crankshaft may have broken, causing the propeller to penetrate various parts of the aircraft. The achievements of Ferrarin and Del Prete, and the S.64, are commemorated in Rio de Janeiro's Pra√ßa Carlo Del Prete with a statue of Del Prete and a 1:2 scale bronze model of the aircraft.

The concept of voluntary action arises in many areas of study, including cognitive psychology, operant conditioning, philosophy, neurology, criminology, and others. Additionally, voluntary action has various meanings depending on the context in which it is used. For example, operant psychology uses the term to refer to the actions that are modifiable by their consequences. A more cognitive account may refer to voluntary action as involving the identification of a desired outcome together with the action necessary to achieve that outcome. Voluntary action is often associated with consciousness and will. For example, Psychologist Charles Nuckolls holds that we control our voluntary behavior, and that it is not known how we come to plan what actions will be executed. Many psychologists, notably Tolman, apply the concept of voluntary action to both animal and human behavior, raising the issue of animal consciousness and its role in voluntary action. (See animal consciousness) Hommel, B.(2003). \\"Acquisition and control of voluntary action\\", pp. 34‚Äì48 in Roth, Gerhard (Ed.) Voluntary action: Brains, minds, and sociality. New York, NY: Oxford University Press  History: William James on voluntary action  The concept of voluntary action was discussed by William James in his influential book The Principles of Psychology (1890). James states that for an act to be classified as a voluntary, it must be foreseen, as opposed to involuntary action which occurs without foresight. James suggests, for example, that the idea of a particular movement is a voluntary action; however, the movement itself, once the idea has been formed, is involuntary, provided the action itself require no further thought.James, W. (1890). The Principles of Psychology, Vol 2. New York, NY: Holt & Co. Voluntary action arises because humans and animals wish to fulfill desires. In order to fulfill these desires, humans and animals form goals and voluntary actions are undertaken to achieve these goals. Some of the terms that James used to describe voluntary action ‚Äì such as desire ‚Äì are now outdated, and his introspective approach is out of favor, but many of his ideas are still find a place in current thinking.

It lies off the Foxe Peninsula area of southwestern Baffin Island in the Qikiqtaaluk Region. It is serviced by an airport and a harbour. The island was named after the statesman Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset. Geography The island is long and wide, with its highest elevation above sea level. On the southern end of Dorset Island, at an elevation of above sea level, the mountain, Cape Dorset (z),Cape Dorset projects into the Hudson Strait. It is part of the Kingnait Range (Kingnait, in Inuktitut, means \\"high mountains\\"). The cape represents the southern tip of the Foxe Peninsula. On September 24, 1631, Captain Luke Foxe named the landform \\"Cape Dorset\\" to honour his benefactor, Lord Chamberlain, Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset. Kingnait Hill, at high, is located on the island's north-west side. The shorter Eegatuak Hill is located north of the cape, on its eastern side, rising above sea level, and exhibiting a distinctive bowl-shape surmounted by a cairn. Mallik Island, directly to the north, is joined to Dorset Island by sand and boulders. A natural harbour exists in the peninsula formed by the southeast side of Mallik Island and the northwest side of Dorset Island with prevailing northwesterly winds at knots, stronger in September and October. The anchorage may have heavy swell conditions and there is frequent fog during the navigation season of early August through mid-October. Ice break-up is around mid-July, and freeze-up occurs in early November. Winter ice thickness can be up to . There are several other islands within , including Ukaliqtuuq and Saqajaa. History In 1913, a trading post was established on the island by the Hudson's Bay Company. A Roman Catholic mission was located on Dorset Island during the period of 1938 to 1960. The first discovery of the remains of Dorset culture was on Dorset Island. An ancient Paleo-Eskimo people, they flourished in this area for about 2,000 years, during the period of 1000 BC through 1100 AD. Present-day Dorset Islanders, Inuit who descend from the later Thule culture, refer to Dorset culture people as Tuniit in their legends. In 1947, the Nascopie, a Hudson's Bay Company supply ship was wrecked on the island. Some of the ship was salvaged by the Inuit for building supplies.Cape Dorset at Travel Nunavut Community Across from Mallik Island, on the northern side of Dorset Island is located the Inuit hamlet of Kinngait (formerly Cape Dorset). It is approximately north of the mountain cape bearing the same name. Because the people of this community are known for their artisanship, including drawing, printmaking, and carving, the community of Kinngait is commonly referred to as the \\"Inuit art capital\\". Wildlife The island and its surrounds are frequented by Baffin Island wolves, polar bears, and Arctic fox, as well as caribou and Arctic hare. Seals appear regularly, as do beluga whale during their migration through by the island in October and April. Peregrine falcons, snowy owls, ptarmigan and ducks abound. Ornithologists consider the island's cape a major entry way to the nesting area of the blue goose. In 1929, it was the departure point for naturalist Dr. J. Dewey Soper in his quest for locate the blue goose's Foxe Basin nest area. Mallikjuaq Territorial Park spans both Dorset Island and Mallik Island. Notable for its Thule culture, Dorset culture, and Inuit archaeological sites that date back as far as 3,000 years ago, it is reachable by foot from Kinngait at low tide, or by boat.

The mine opened in 1832 and was closed in 1936. Over the years several seams were worked through four shafts: Kettledrum pit, Lamp pit, Mary pit and New pit. In 1882 an underground explosion killed 13 men and in 1909 another explosion killed 168 men.  The colliery  The colliery extended over an area of . There were a number of seams, some of which were too thin to be economically worked. The seams which were worked in 1876 and 1909 were: Shield Row (6'11\\" at 39 fathoms), Five Quarter (4'0\\" at 52¬Ω fathoms), Brass Thill (5'0\\" at 62 fathoms), Low Main (4'6\\" at 93 fathoms), Hutton (3'9\\" at 97 fathoms), Towneley (4'5\\" at 123 fathoms), Busty (10'1\\" at 139 fathoms) and Brockwell (2'0\\" at 163 fathoms). Two of the pits: Busty pit (also known as the New pit) and the Lamp shaft were sunk the full distance. Before 1882 they had both reached the Busty coal. Between then and 1902 they were deepened to reach the Brockwell seam. Subsequently, the Busty shaft was further deepened to reach the Victoria coal (2'1\\" at 170 fathoms) but this coal was only worked for the last few years of the mine's life. The other two pits (Kettledrum and Mary) were the first pits and were only sunk to the Hutton seam. Unaccountably Morley claims only one of these pits reached the Hutton coal, the other stopped short at the Shield Row. The Durham Mining Museum states both reached the Hutton coal, supported by documents from the North of England Institute of Mining & Mechanical Engineers. Since 1862 collieries have been required by law to have at least two pits reaching any seams being worked, see Hartley Colliery disaster. The Busty pit was the downcast pit, that is the pit down which air passes to ventilate the workings. The Lamp pit was the upcast pit, that is the one up which the air passes. At the time of both disasters the ventilation was by induced draft provided by 30 (later 35) foot diameter fan. Coal was drawn up the Busty shaft from the Busty and Hutton seams in 1882. By 1909 only the Busty level was serviced directly: coal was lowered down a staple from the Towneley and down a drift from the Tilley. Because mechanical ventilation was used (rather than the earlier furnace system), coal could be drawn up the upcast. In 1882 the Low Main and Shield Row coals were serviced by the Lamp shaft, in 1909 only the Brockwell coal was raised this way. Firedamp Mines in which there was a significant amount of firedamp came into the category of \\"fiery mines\\" and had special rules applied to mitigate the danger. In 1882 the then manager (William Johnson) would not admit that West Stanley was a fiery mine, however the rules applicable to such a mine were in force. The official enquiry states that \\"the presence of gas had been reported frequently during the four or five months before the explosion\\". In the 1909 report firedamp \\"had only been reported once during the present year [1909]\\". 1882 disaster The 1882 explosion occurred at 1a.m. on the morning of 19 April. It was localised in the Busty seam. From the shafts major passages known as \\"headways\\" radiated off north, south and west. Each headway gave access to a district. From the north and south headways other passageways were driven: the north and south cross-cuts. Each of these led to a sub-district. The explosion occurred within the north cross-cut district where two men had been working. From the position of the men and their food, they appeared to have been taking a food break. A large stone measuring \\"from 4 to 5 yards long, 2 feet broad, and from 10 inches to a foot in thickness\\" (approximately 4m x 0.6m x 28 cm) had fallen from the roof. Above it was a large hole going up at least possibly as much as to the coal seam above. The report concluded that this fall released a large quantity of firedamp which had been under pressure within the cavity. The inspector was unable to decide which of two things then happened: either that the outrush of gas was sufficient to blow the flame through the gauze of one of their safety lamps, or that as the men started to move away from the fall they snatched up their lamps causing a sufficient air current to pass the flame. There had been indications of a large quantity of gas in the area; not only had it already been detected but also hissing and bubbling sounds had been heard. There had also been a heaving of the floor and fissures had been seen. The lamps in use were Clanny lamps which were known to pass the flame in a moderate current. The owner had tried to introduce Mueseler lamps (which withstand a greater current of air) but the men had resisted them since they gave a poorer light. The six lamps found near the seat of the explosion were tested. All passed, but some were slightly damaged and three were unlocked. The inspector reported that the mine management was somewhat deficient. No certified copy of the rules could be found, one of the deputies was illiterate so could not have read and enforced the rules, reports were not made in the correct books, licenses for men who were permitted to carry lamp keys and fire shots were not issued, the barometer and thermometer records were not correctly kept. However, in his final remarks Morley accepted that on this occasion the management deficiencies did not contribute to the disaster.  1909 disaster  The 1909 explosion occurred at 3:45p.m. on 16 February. By 2a.m. the downcast shaft was available for rescue parties to descend. They entered the Townely and Busty seams, and from thence went into the Tilley seam. In the latter they found and brought out 26 men. From the Townley seam four men were found, but one died from the effects of afterdamp after 30 hours. Eventually another 165 bodies were retrieved, two were unaccounted for when the search was called off. In 1933 later workings broke into the Busty seam and two skeletons were discovered. They were identified as the missing men. Before the explosion By this date a significant amount of electricity was being used underground. Two electrically driven coal cutting machines were used in the Townley seam and one each in the Tilley and Brockwell seams. The largest motors underground were the pump in the Busty seam near to the Busty shaft and the haulage motor in the Townley seam. There were also two smaller 25 horsepower motors and three 5 horsepower motors elsewhere in the colliery. To power this a 40 Hz 550 volt 150 amp three phase generator was installed on the surface which delivered the power through insulated (but unarmoured) cables down the Busty shaft. As well as the motors, there were a few incandescent lamps around the shafts. All other illumination was from Marsaut and Donald type safety lamps. The lamps were lit and locked on the surface, and if extinguished had to be sent back to the surface for relighting. However, following the discovery in 1933 of the two skeletons an inquest was held (as required by law). At this inquest J B Atkinson attempted to present fresh evidence that another type of lamp was in use. This was the Howart's Patent Deflector lamp which was larger than the standard lamps. As a result of the increased volume the lamp was unsafe; an explosion inside would be large enough to pass through the gauze and ignite the surrounding atmosphere. The coroner allowed him to read the statement, but the jury were directed to disregard it in their determination of the identity and cause of death. Other preventative measures were watering, control of shot firing and inspections. Watering to keep coal dust damp was performed regularly, however the inspector cast doubt upon its effectiveness having observed pools of water next to dry dust. Shot firing to bring down stone and, in some seams, coal appears to have been tightly controlled. Inspections on behalf of the men were meant to be carried out every three months. The reports from January 1909 could not be produced. Those from September 1908 were produced and were all satisfactory. The Explosion Five minutes before the explosion the man in charge of the large pump in the Busty seam advised the generator house that he was about to start the pump. This was normal procedure. Five minutes later there was a \\"burring\\" noise from the generators indicating an electrical overload, followed by two of the three (one per phase) fuses blowing. Smoke issued from the downcast shaft, in other words moving against the air flow, followed fifty seconds later by a fireball and cloud of smoke. A few moments later the cloud was sucked back down the downcast shaft as the air circulation re-established. Both main shafts were damaged by the explosion. The downcast (Busty) shaft suffered damage all the way to the surface, and then the casing between the pit top and the heapstead was blown down. The upcast (lamp) pit also suffered damage, but fortunately the fan was uninjured and continued to run. Before the district inspector could arrive the shaftmen had already started to clear away the debris from the downshaft. A temporary hospital was established at the pithead. Medical and rescue stores were brought in and by 2a.m. the cages could be lowered down the pit. The men mentioned above were brought up, but there were no further survivors. Recovery and exploration work went on \\"unceasingly\\" until 6 days after the explosion all but two of the bodies had been recovered and brought up. The search for these two (the ones found in 1933) was abandoned due to increasing danger to the recovery parties. Investigation The first step in investigating a colliery explosion is to determine where the explosion occurred. In the case of West Stanley the official report states \\"in no case that we [ie Redmayne and Bain] have investigated has it been more perplexing than the one under consideration\\". The first thought was that the seat of the explosion might have been in or near the engine house in the Towneley seam, but further investigation rendered this unlikely. The Brockwell seam was next considered. There was evidence of some burning; this being the only place in the mine where it was observed. No cause of ignition, accumulation of gas or the presence of a blower was found. Further damage to the props and the separation door indicated that the explosion had swept into the seam (\\"inbye\\") before sweeping out (\\"outbye\\"). There was no damage to the Tilley seam and the men working there had been saved, so it was not considered further. The only seam left was the Busty coal. The onsetter, Matthew Elliott, was the only man to have survived from the Busty seam and his evidence is quoted at length. Critically the electric lights went out at the time the explosion was heard (\\"Yes, it was instantaneous\\"), some time before the cloud was observed by a safety lamp. Two mining engineers who had arrived at 8p.m. following the explosion were cross examined and agreed that the explosion occurred in the Busty seam and was due to a coal dust. Neither could say how the dust was ignited. The inquiry then considered how the coal dust might have been ignited. Four possibilities were considered: Open lights (lamps or matches), shot firing, sparking from friction and electricity. No evidence of faulty lights or contraband was found (though there remains the question of the Howart's Patent Deflector reported at the 1933 inquiry). All shots were accounted for and every shot hole inspected; none was fired at the time or shortly before the explosion. Friction from tubs (coal wagons) against the rails or following a derailment was considered and dismissed. Electricity was then considered. The fuses within the mine did not blow, but evidence from the colliery electrician mentioned a previous occasion when sparking had burnt through a cable and not blown the fuses. Dr W M Thornton, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Armstrong College was then called as a witness. He considered three causes but settled on one in particular as the most likely; that a train of coal dust between the terminals of a junction box or switch causes arcing between the terminals which ignited the coal dust causing an explosion within the box. This explosion raised enough dust to trigger a bigger, fatal, explosion which spread throughout the mine. The report concluded with a number of recommendations including better mechanical protection of electrical equipment (impact and ingress of gas or dust), trip coils in place of fuses and better cleaning. Aftermath A pit-wheel memorial was erected at Chester Road in Stanley. It shows all of the people who died in that incident. A memorial service was held in 2009 to mark the centenary of the disaster.

Formed in 1993 as Inearthed and splitting up in 2019, the final line-up of the group consisted of Alexi Laiho (lead guitar, lead vocals), Jaska Raatikainen (drums), Henkka Sepp√§l√§ (bass guitar), Janne Wirman (keyboards), and Daniel Freyberg (rhythm guitar). The band released ten studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, two compilation albums and one DVD. The band's third studio album, Follow the Reaper, was their first album to receive a gold certification in Finland, and subsequent studio albums acquired the same status. Their next four albums debuted at number one on the Finnish album charts, and have also seen chart positions on the United States Billboard 200. They are one of Finland's best selling artists of all time with more than 250,000 records sold there alone. In 2019 Children of Bodom held their last concert before disbanding the band. Laiho and Freyberg carried on as Bodom After Midnight in 2020.  History   Formation and early years (1993‚Äì1997)  Lead guitarist and singer Alexi Laiho at Rockharz Open Air 2016 Rhythm guitarist Daniel Freyberg 2016 Children of Bodom was formed in 1993 by guitarist Alexi \\"Wildchild\\" Laiho and drummer Jaska Raatikainen under the name of Inearthed. They had known each other since early childhood and had shared an interest in heavy metal, especially death metal groups, such as Dissection, Entombed, Cannibal Corpse, Autopsy, and Obituary and classic metal groups such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Dio, and Ozzy Osbourne. Bassist Samuli Miettinen completed the initial line-up of the band. Inearthed recorded its first demo, Implosion of Heaven, during August of the same year. Samuli was the main composer of the band's lyrics for the two years that he took part in Inearthed, but his family moved to the United States in 1995, making it impossible for him to remain in the band. His last contributions to Inearthed were the lyrics of the songs from their second demo, Ubiquitous Absence of Remission which was the first time they worked with producer Anssi Kippo at Astia-studios (Lappeenranta, Finland). In this demo, keyboards were incorporated into the band's songs for the first time. In order to achieve this, both Laiho and Raatikainen played the keyboards separately and subsequently mixed the recorded track with the other instruments. Laiho, who had previously only composed the melodies of the songs, assumed the role of the band's lyricist. At the time, Raatikainen played French horn in a local big band, and during a rehearsal, he met Alexander Kuoppala, a trumpet player and also a proficient guitarist. Shortly after the recording of their second demo, Kuoppala was invited to join Inearthed as a rhythm guitarist. The bassist chosen to replace Samuli was Henkka \\"Blacksmith\\" Sepp√§l√§, whom Laiho and Raatikainen had previously known from school. Apart from playing the bass, Sepp√§l√§ also often doubles as the band's backing vocalist. Also, the band recruited a musician to specialize on keyboards, whose name was Jani Pirisjoki. Both joined Inearthed in early 1996. With this new line-up, Inearthed proceeded to record their third demo, entitled Shining. This demo did not impress record labels any more than the previous ones had, and none took interest in the band. Despite their efforts, their music got little exposure and managed only to play at local events. As a last resort, the band decided to record an independent, self-funded album. Laiho wanted to make use of the keyboards more effectively, but Pirisjoki was not attending rehearsals. Thus, he was fired and replaced by a friend of Raatikainen's, a jazz pianist named Janne \\"Warman\\" Wirman. Wirman was the component which was previously missing from Inearthed. His presence allowed the band to assume the style which would later characterize Children of Bodom. With Wirman, the band successfully recorded their first album in 1997. Their debut, Something Wild, was supposed to be released by a small Belgian label, Shiver Records, but second vocalist Sami Tenetz (from Thy Serpent) acquired a copy of their album through the hands of Kuoppala. They both worked for the same company at the time. Shortly after Inearthed signed this contract, Spinefarm Records' boss became interested in signing them for a country-wide release. The latter deal was much more attractive to the band since the Belgian label was offering them close to no help, to the point where they would have to distribute and sell the album themselves. The band was required to create a new name to sign up to Spinefarm Records. The contract with Shiver records had already been signed under the name of Inearthed. The answer to that problem came as the members looked for good names in their local phone book. When they stumbled upon Lake Bodom, they realized that it was a name with impact and one which had an interesting story behind it. A long list of possible names involving the word Bodom was then made, and they settled with Children of Bodom. The band's name is derived from the Lake Bodom murders.  Something Wild (1997‚Äì1998) Something Wild was produced, recorded and mixed by Anssi Kippo and Children of Bodom at Astia-studios (Lappeenranta, Finland). In an attempt to promote their band, they opened a show for Dimmu Borgir in 1997. Their success was such that a representative from the Nuclear Blast label approached them with a contract for a European release, a deal which started on the subsequent year. Something Wild was released in late 1997 in Finland and in 1998 worldwide. In early 1998, for promotional purposes, the band recorded a music video of the song \\"Deadnight Warrior\\". The video was directed by Mika Lindberg and had a slim budget of ‚Ç¨1000. It made use of simple scenery, which consisted essentially of an outdoors location after a snowstorm. The band played for a couple of hours at night, with an average temperature of minus fifteen degrees Celsius. Although Laiho is very critical of all of the music he has written, he notes that he dislikes Something Wild the most of all of his albums. When recording this album, Laiho had tried to mimic the style of one of his idols, Yngwie Malmsteen, which is why Something Wild is considered one of the most technical albums Children of Bodom have produced. Despite this, he still considers it to be their \\"most important\\" record, as it \\"put them on the map.\\" Children of Bodom's first European tour began in February 1998. They played with bands such as Hypocrisy (at such festivals as Under the Black Sun), The Kovenant and Agathodaimon, but suffered from the absence of Wirman, who was concentrating on finishing his studies. He was replaced by pianist Erna Siikavirta for the duration of the tour. Months later, the band recorded two new songs again at Astia-studios with producer Anssi Kippo, entitled \\"Towards Dead End\\" and \\"Children of Bodom\\". The latter was included in a compilation by Spinefarm Records, which after being released remained on the top of Finnish charts for eight consecutive weeks. In late August, the band played the song \\"Forevermore\\" live for the first time during a show in Russia. This song was later renamed \\"Downfall\\". Their second European tour occurred in September of that same year, but once more Wirman was not able to perform with them. Laiho's then-girlfriend Kimberly Goss (from Sinergy and formerly of Dimmu Borgir, Ancient and Therion) assumed the keyboards this time. By the end of the tour, Kimberly invited Laiho to join Sinergy, which at the time was still in its early stages.  Hatebreeder (1998‚Äì2000)  The second album, Hatebreeder, was recorded between the end of 1998 and the beginning of 1999 by Anssi Kippo at Astia-studios (Lappeenranta, Finland). It was originally entitled Towards Dead End, but while in studio the members of the band opted for the current title. To create anticipation in Finland, the '\\"Downfall\\" single was released two weeks prior to the album's release. It was accompanied by a new music video, once more directed by Mika Lindberg. Hatebreeder ultimately topped the charts in many European countries. In July 1999, the success of the \\"Downfall\\" single and Hatebreeder allowed Children of Bodom to schedule three concerts in Japan with Sinergy and In Flames. During two of these concerts, the live album Tokyo Warhearts was recorded. In it the band managed to seamlessly reproduce and at times improve on their songs. At their request, no overdubs were used on the recording of the concert.  Follow the Reaper (2000‚Äì2002)  For their next release, Children of Bodom decided to make use of Peter T√§gtgren's Abyss studio in Sweden instead of the Finnish Astia-studio from Anssi Kippo where they had recorded all of their previous releases including the demos from Inearthed. The band wrote eight songs for the album. While in the studio, they decided to include an extra track that was hastily composed and featured lyrics improvised by Laiho; that track would eventually receive the name of \\"Kissing the Shadows\\". The band gave the album the name of Follow the Reaper and recording sessions took place between August and September 2000; the album saw a worldwide release in late 2000. A music video for \\"Everytime I Die\\" was recorded by the Finnish director Tuukka Temonen shortly after. Hate Crew Deathroll (2002‚Äì2004) In February 2002, Children of Bodom began writing songs for their upcoming album, entitled Hate Crew Deathroll. They returned to Astia-studio (Lappeenranta, Finland) to work with producer Anssi Kippo again. The session ensued during the months of August and September, and the album was released January 2003 in Finland. It remained on the top of the Finnish charts for a total of three weeks and subsequently became the band's first gold album. Eventually, all of the band's albums reached this status and Follow the Reaper reached platinum. On 3 January 2003, the Finnish Metal Music Awards were held at Tavastia Club in Helsinki. Voting was open to all the metal fans and was presented through the various media outlets that were working with the event's organizers. Children of Bodom was awarded Finnish Band of the Year. Children of Bodom's first world tour began in 2003 and lasted until late 2004. The tour had many sold-out concerts and marked the consolidation of the band in North America, but was also accompanied by an unexpected announcement: Kuoppala decided to quit Children of Bodom for personal reasons right in the middle of the tour without giving previous warning. In an interview, when Laiho was asked why Kuoppala left the band, he stated that \\"Well, I try to be careful about what I say about him because there is no bad blood between us. He told me that he just got sick of touring and the whole band/rock 'n roll lifestyle living in hotels and tour buses and stuff. For me it was really weird because he was always the one who was SO into it! He was a die hard rock 'n roller and suddenly he made a quick 180 turn in his whole life. This whole situation involves a new girlfriend.\\" Griffin's guitarist Kai Nergaard was invited by Laiho to replace Kuoppala, but did not accept the offer. Thus, Alexi's bandmate from Sinergy, Roope Latvala (founding member of Stone, one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the guitars as a session player, until a more permanent solution could be found. This formation was introduced in Moscow on 16 August.  Are You Dead Yet? (2004‚Äì2007)  Children of Bodom live in Milan 2006. After finishing the world tour with Latvala ‚Äì who then assumed a permanent position in the band's line-up ‚Äì Children of Bodom proceeded to record and release the EP Trashed, Lost & Strungout and the single \\"In Your Face\\", which contained songs from their upcoming album and a parody cover of \\"Oops!... I Did It Again\\" by Britney Spears. In late 2005, the album Are You Dead Yet? was released, featuring a style different from what had been presented by the band on its previous works. Simpler and heavier guitar riffs were incorporated into Children of Bodom's sound, as well as elements from industrial music. Reactions from fans to the release were varied; however, the album remains the band's most commercially successful. It was awarded gold status in Finland and reached first place on the Finnish charts, 16th in Germany, 16 in Sweden and 17 in Japan. The next release of the band was a DVD- single for the song \\"In Your Face\\", which included the music video, backstage footage from the band and a live recording of the song \\"Sixpounder\\" at Wacken Open Air festival in 2004. In June, Children of Bodom was in front of 120,000 spectators, one of their biggest concerts, on the last concert of the B√∂hse Onkelz. The DVD of the concert, called Vaya Con Tioz, includes Children of Bodom's performance of \\"Everytime I Die\\". Children of Bodom's live DVD Chaos Ridden Years - Stockholm Knockout Live was released on 5 December 2006. It contains a recording of a live concert performed on 5 February 2006 in Stockholm, Sweden, with over 90 minutes of live footage. \\"Chaos Ridden Years\\" refers to a documentary featuring interviews with band members about the history of the band and footage of the band on tour. It also contains every music video Children of Bodom has made, except for \\"Needled 24/7\\". Guitarist Alexi Laiho was voted world's best guitarist of 2006 by Metal Hammer magazine. In June 2006, the band embarked on one of their biggest tours: The Unholy Alliance tour, playing alongside Slayer, Lamb of God, Mastodon, In Flames and Thine Eyes Bleed. The bands toured the US through June and July, and Europe through October and November. On 31 January 2007, Laiho slid down the lane at a bowling alley after accidentally stepping over the foul line. He slammed hard into the wall, breaking his left shoulder. This rendered him unable to play guitar for six weeks. Due to this incident, Children of Bodom was forced to cancel their first 2007 tours, and a festival that they were slated to headline. On 31 March 2007, the band's website released information on Laiho's condition stating that while Laiho's injury will never fully heal, it no longer affects his ability to play the guitar. The same notice also stated that the band had already written some songs for a new album and would start recording sometime later in 2007. Children of Bodom was selected to replace Velvet Revolver for the Monsters of Rock festival, playing on the same stage as Ozzy Osbourne and Megadeth.  Blooddrunk (2007‚Äì2009)  Masters of Rock From October to December 2007, Children of Bodom recorded their sixth studio album, entitled Blooddrunk, which was released on 15 April 2008. The album contained 10 songs including a cover of \\"Ghost Riders in the Sky\\". Children of Bodom was featured on the Gigantour 2008 North American tour with Megadeth, In Flames, Job for a Cowboy and High on Fire. Children of Bodom was one of the first bands to be confirmed for Wacken Open Air 2008, where they performed alongside many bands including Iron Maiden, Sonata Arctica and Avantasia. Children of Bodom played at Donington Download on 15 June, playing a mixture of old and new songs. On 8 March 2008, Children of Bodom did their first UK signing event at the Zavvi music shop in Oxford Street, London. They signed copies of their new single \\"Blooddrunk\\" in CD, 7 inch and 12 inch vinyls, only 666 copies of the 12 inch vinyls have been made. On 26 June 2008, Children of Bodom played their first show in Auckland, New Zealand with support from local scene acts Dawn of Azazel and Subtract at the Transmission Room. In 2008, Children of Bodom's first three studio albums, as well as Tokyo Warhearts, were remastered and re-released with bonus tracks. In September and October 2008, the band toured the U.S. supporting Blooddrunk with support from The Black Dahlia Murder and Between the Buried and Me. Testament also made a special guest appearance in the main support slot at the tour's New York City date. In November and December 2008, the band toured in Europe supporting Slipknot and Machine Head. From late January to early March 2009, the band also co-headlined the European tour with Cannibal Corpse with Diablo opening for them. On 2 April 2009, Children of Bodom embarked on the No Fear Energy Tour headlined by Lamb of God with main support from As I Lay Dying and themselves, and rotating opening slots with God Forbid and Municipal Waste, but dropped off the tour a week before it was finished following a serious injury Alexi suffered after falling from the top bunk of his tour bus on 26 April 2009, after the show in Palladium Ballroom, Dallas, Texas. In addition to the injury, on 8 May 2009, at Roseland Ballroom in New York City, Alexi and Children of Bodom were forced to quit playing after a few of their songs because of Alexi's previous injury. Laiho originally planned to continue touring despite his injury but was forced to cancel last six dates when any efforts to alleviate the pain failed. All summer festival dates went down as planned and were unaffected by Alexi's injury. In February 2009, Children of Bodom hinted at plans to release a cover album entitled Skeletons in the Closet, which was released on 23 September 2009. They also admitted to being \\"lazy\\" when it comes to practicing and talked about plans to have more songs on future albums. The band embarked on a tour of South America and Mexico in September 2009. Support for the trek came from Amorphis. Also in September and October 2009, the band returned to North America to headline a massive month- long tour. On most dates support on the trek came from The Black Dahlia Murder and Skeletonwitch. Austrian Death Machine and Holy Grail made a special guest appearance in the main support slot at the tour's second Pomona, California date. On October 18, 2009, four days after the band's North American tour finale in Honolulu, Hawaii they performed at Japan's Loudpark Festival along with Megadeth, Judas Priest, Slayer, Anthrax, Rob Zombie and Arch Enemy. In the six days following their performance at the Loudpark Festival, they held three shows in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China respectively. They finished their two-month September to October tour in Moscow, Russia. This concluded their year and a half long Blooddrunk World Tour.  Skeletons in the Closet (2009‚Äì2010)  Skeletons in the Closet is a cover album released on 22 September 2009. It features covers released on versions of previous albums but also includes four new tracks. Covered artists include Suicidal Tendencies, Britney Spears, Alice Cooper, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Andrew WK, Billy Idol and Scorpions Children of Bodom featured a contest to promote their new album in which anyone could win prizes featuring an ESP/LTD M-53 electric guitar, the band's entire back catalog, and Skeletons in the Closet. The contest ran from 25 August to 21 September 2009. The winners were announced 28 September 2009.  Relentless Reckless Forever (2010‚Äì2012) After the Blooddrunk tour ended, Children of Bodom started recording their new album. During the recording of the drum tracks there was a small tornado and the power was cut out. Consequently, the recording was delayed until after their tour with Black Label Society. Children of Bodom released some information to Metal Hammer magazine about new album tracks. The three track names they released were entitled: \\"Pussyfoot Miss Suicide\\", \\"Ugly\\", and \\"Was It Worth It?\\" In November the band announced \\"The Ugly World Tour 2011\\" which would run from March‚ÄìMay 2011 and would feature dates around Europe.

Halo of Blood (2012‚Äì2014) Halo of Blood is the band's eighth studio album. It was released on 6 June in Europe, 10 June in the United Kingdom and on 11 June in North America. The Mayhem Festival tour alongside Rob Zombie, Mastodon and Amon Amarth was also announced on 18 March 2013. Music journalist Neil Kelly of PopMatters said in praise of the album, \\"Death metal could very well re- enter mainstream consciousness through Halo of Blood, the most accessible Children of Bodom release yet.\\" In May 2014, the band toured eastern Australia, visiting Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne with Eye of the Enemy as support, along with Orpheus Omega in Melbourne, and Emergency Gate in Brisbane and Sydney.  I Worship Chaos (2015‚Äì2016)  On 7 April 2015, the band announced that they have begun working on the follow-up of Halo of Blood. On 29 May 2015, the band announced on their Facebook page that Roope Latvala is no longer part of Children of Bodom with the new album to be recorded as a four-piece for the first time. However, the band later updated that Latvala's part in the band will be filled in by Antti Wirman, keyboardist Janne Wirman's younger brother for live commitments until the end of the year; he debuted with the band in a private live show in Helsinki. In a later interview with Wirman, he stated that his brother would not join the band permanently. On 8 June 2015, the album title was announced as I Worship Chaos and was released through Nuclear Blast on 2 October 2015. On 19 January 2016, the band announced the addition of Daniel Freyberg on guitar. He would make his live debut with them in Tampa, Florida on 9 February.  Hexed (2017‚Äì2019)  In an interview with Noizr Zine, taken on September 14, 2017, Children of Bodom's keyboardist Janne Wirman answering to the question about the band's plans to start working on a new album with \\"the same production team\\" (Mikko Karmila and Mika Jussila) after '20 Years Down & Dirty' tour ends, said the following: \\"Yes, I think we are. And we‚Äôre going to record it in our warehouse.\\" In November 2017, Bassist Henkka Sepp√§l√§ discussed in an interview that the band have half an album's worth of material written for the next album. They began to start recording the new album in March 2018. In August 2018, Sepp√§l√§ stated in an interview with TotalRock Radio that the album will be released in early 2019. In November 2018, the band revealed that the next album will be called \\"Hexed\\". It was released on 8 March 2019.  Final show and disbandment (2019‚Äì2020)  On November 1, 2019, it was announced that Children of Bodom will play their final show with the line-up at the time on December 15. The gig, dubbed \\"A Chapter Called Children of Bodom\\", took place at the Helsinki Ice Hall, Finland. The statement said: It was later reported that the main reason for the departures was that Raatikainen, Sepp√§l√§ and Wirman could no longer find a shared viewpoint with Laiho. Laiho and Freyberg have already found a new bassist and a new drummer according to Helsingin Sanomat.http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=146344 ‚Äú According to Finnish music zine Soundi, Laiho cannot use the band‚Äôs name without permission from his former bandmates.

Although the NFL had begun permitting such \\"underclassmen\\" to apply for the draft in 1989, within a few years it was clear that commission-based sports agents had deluded many of them as to their likely demand by teams and future salaries. 76 of the first 165 underclassmen to apply were not drafted, and once a college football player has entered the draft, he is no longer eligible to play college football.This differs from the rules in college basketball; players do not lose college eligibility by declaring for the NBA Draft, as long as they withdraw from the draft before the final deadline and do not sign with an agent. Thus, it was important that such players understand whether they would likely be among the small number of players drafted, and what their salaries might be, before committing to the process. Board logistics The board is composed of general managers and personnel directors from a number of NFL teams, along with the directors of the NFL's two scouting combines, BLESTO and The National. Before 2015 it issued an advisory opinion that a player has potential to be picked: *in the first round *as high as the second round *as high as the third round *after the third round *in no round at all or some range thereof. These apparently could have included a specific opinion that a player will be drafted in the \\"third or fourth round\\"Mark Edwards, Powers removes all doubt, Decatur Daily, January 18, 2010 or \\"first or second round\\",Michigan's Warren skipping senior season for draft, Associated Press (Sporting News), December 20, 2009 which is usually known as a \\"first day\\" pick, because Round 1 is on the first day of the draft.Calvin Watkins, Dallas Cowboys go without a first-day pick, Dallas Morning News, April 26, 2009 The board has a fair track record that has successfully predicted pick placement for some underclassmen but not others. From 2012 to 2014 it accurately predicted the selections of 73.7% of the players the board graded as first- round selections, and 85.4% of the players it graded for the second, but almost 53% of those receiving third-round grades or lower were not drafted. The number of underclassmen declaring for the draft rose from 56 in 2011 to 98 in 2014, setting a record each year. After 36 (37%) of those declaring in 2014 went undrafted, and eight schools had more than five underclassmen declaring, the board altered its procedure. it offers three opinions: *first round *second round *neither, which means that the board advises the player to stay in school Also, the number of players from a school seeking an opinion is limited to five, with some exceptions. The NFL reported that the number of underclassmen requesting evaluations for the 2015 draft declined by 42%, from 214 to 147, and the number declaring for the draft declined by 20.4%, to 76. Player's role 167 underclassmen applied for an evaluation during the 2007-2008 season. Players typically submit their requests for a Board opinion by late December and, after receiving the panel's report, have until mid- January to decide whether to enter the draft.Virginia Tech Safety May Enter Draft, Washington Post, Dec. 19, 2008 They have 72 hours after the deadline to change their minds and decide to not enter.

They are assistants to the manager, who determines the lineup and decides how to substitute players during the game. Beyond the manager, more than a half dozen coaches may assist the manager in running the team. Essentially, baseball coaches are analogous to assistant coaches in other sports, as the baseball manager is to the head coach. Roles of professional baseball coaches Hall of Fame manager Connie Mack wearing a suit instead of a team uniform Baseball is unique in that the manager and coaches typically all wear numbered uniforms similar to those of the players. Notable exceptions to this were Baseball Hall of Fame manager Connie Mack, who always wore a black suit during his 50 years at the helm of the Philadelphia Athletics, and Burt Shotton, manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the late 1940s, who wore a Dodger 200 cap and a team jacket over street clothes in the dugout. After the widespread adoption of numbered uniforms in the early 1930s, Joe McCarthy, another Hall of Fame manager, wore a full uniform but no number on his back for the remainder of his career (with the New York Yankees, then the Boston Red Sox). Coincidentally, all three men retired during or after the same season‚Äî. Full-time coaches in professional baseball date to , when John McGraw of the New York Giants engaged Arlie Latham and Wilbert Robinson as coaches.Thorne, John, and Palmer, Pete, eds., Total Baseball. New York: Warner Books, 1989, page 2,153 By the 1920s, most Major League teams had two full-time coaches, although the manager often doubled as third-base coach and specialists such as pitching coaches were rare. After World War II, most MLB teams listed between three and five coaches on their roster, as managers increasingly ran their teams from the dugout full-time, and appointed pitching and bullpen coaches to assist them and the baseline coaches. Batting and bench coaches came into vogue during the 1960s and later. Because of the proliferation of uniformed coaches in the modern game, by the late 2000s Major League Baseball had restricted the number of uniformed staff to six coaches and one manager during the course of a game.The Associated Press, March 30, 2007 Beginning with the 2013 season, clubs are permitted to employ a seventh uniformed coach, designated the assistant hitting coach, at their own discretion. Bench coach The first bench coach in baseball was George Huff, who took that helm for the Illinois Fighting Illini baseball in 1905; at the time, it meant a coach present throughout the season. More recently, the bench coach is a team's second-in- command. The bench coach serves as an in-game advisor to the manager, offering situational advice, and bouncing ideas back and forth in order to assist the manager in making game decisions.\\"The Role of the Bench Coach\\" ‚Äì The Birdhouse If the manager is ejected, suspended, or unable to attend a game for any reason, the bench coach assumes the position of acting manager. If the manager is fired or resigns during the season, it is usually the bench coach who gets promoted to interim manager. The bench coach's responsibilities also include helping to set up the day's practice and stretching routines before a game, as well as coordinating spring training routines and practices.\\"More than just a side job: For a manager, bench coach is a trusted confidant\\" ‚Äì Boston Globe Pitching and bullpen coaches A pitching coach mentors and trains teams' pitchers. He advises the manager on the condition of pitchers and their arms, and serves as an in-game coach for the pitcher currently on the mound. When a manager makes a visit to the mound, he typically is doing so to make a pitching change or to discuss situational defense. However, to talk about mechanics or how to pitch to a particular batter, the pitching coach is the one who will typically visit the mound. The pitching coach is generally a former pitcher. One exception is Dave Duncan, the former pitching coach of the St. Louis Cardinals, who was a catcher. Prior to the early 1950s, pitching coaches were usually former catchers. The bullpen coach is similar to a pitching coach, but works primarily with relief pitchers in the bullpen. He does not make mound visits; rather, he stays in the bullpen the entire game, working with relievers who are warming up to enter the game. Generally, the bullpen coach is either a former pitcher or catcher. Offensive coaches: hitting coach and base coaches A hitting coach, as the name suggests, works with a team's players to improve their hitting techniques and form. He monitors players' swings during the game and over the course of the season, advising them when necessary between at-bats on adjustments to make. He also oversees their performance during practices, cage sessions, and pre-game batting practice. With the advent of technology, hitting coaches are increasingly utilizing video to analyze their hitters along with scouting the opposing pitchers. Video has allowed hitting coaches to clearly illustrate problem areas in the swing, making the adjustment period quicker for the player being analyzed. This process is typically called video analysis. Brian Snitker as third base coach for the Atlanta Braves in 2008. Two on-field coaches are present when the team is at bat. Stationed in designated coaches' boxes near first and third base, they are appropriately named base coaches‚Äîindividually, first base coach and third base coach. They assist in the direction of baserunners, help prevent pickoffs, and relay signals sent from the manager in the dugout to runners and batters. While the first base coach is primarily responsible for the batter as to whether he stops at first base or not or for a runner already on first, the third base coach carries more responsibility. His duties include holding or sending runners rounding second and third bases, as well as having to make critical, split-second decisions about whether to try to score a runner on a hit, and accounting for the arm strength of the opposing team's fielder and the speed and position of his baserunner. Additional coaching responsibilities The bench coach, third base coach, and first base coach often are assigned additional responsibility for assisting players in specific areas, particularly defense. Common designations include outfield instructor, infield instructor, catching instructor, and baserunning instructor.\\"The Mets' Next Third Base Coach\\" NY Daily News When a coaching staff is assembled, the selection of the first base coach is frequently made with the purpose of filling a gap in these coaching responsibilities, as the actual in-game duties of a first base coach are relatively light. Other coaches Teams may also employ individuals to work with players in other areas or activities. These positions sometimes include the word \\"coach\\" in their titles. Individuals holding these positions usually do not dress in uniform during games, as the number of uniformed coaches is restricted by Major League Baseball rules. The most prominent of these positions are the athletic trainer and the strength and conditioning coach. All Major League Baseball teams employ an athletic trainer; most employ a strength and conditioning coach. Other positions include bullpen catcher and batting practice pitcher. Some teams also employ additional coaches without specific responsibilities. Minor and amateur leagues In general, Major League Baseball teams will have one person specifically assigned to each coaching position described above. However, minor league and amateur teams typically have coaches fulfill multiple responsibilities. A typical minor league/amateur team coaching structure will have a manager, a pitching coach, and a hitting coach, each of whom also assumes the responsibilities of the first and third base coaches, bullpen coach, etc. In U.S. college baseball, the title \\"manager\\" is not used; the person who fills the role of a professional manager is instead called the \\"head coach\\".

Description The XM47 (large fins) was only an interim rocket, essentially a rocket test vehicle, and was used for training and testing purposes only. CH-37 helicopter. Carried on the XM34 rocket launcher, it could carry either nuclear or conventional warheads. It was primarily intended for use in airborne assault operations and to complement the heavier, self-propelled MGR-1 Honest John rocket. Development of the missile was started at Army's Rocket and Guided Missile Agency laboratory at Huntsville, Alabama, the Redstone Arsenal, in June 1955. In June 1956, the first launch of the XM47 Little John occurred. This initial model was spin-stabilised by larger triangular fins and a longer launch rail. It was stabilised by the fins alone until it began to spin. The production XM51 version had smaller rectangular fins, too small to stabilise the rocket, and was stabilised from launch by a unique \\"spin-on-straight-rail\\" system. The XM51 Little John was delivered to the field in November 1961 and remained in the regular Army's weapons inventory until August 1969. It was a spin-stabilized field artillery rocket that followed a ballistic trajectory to ground targets. The rocket XM51 consisted of a warhead, a rocket motor assembly, and an igniter assembly. The components were shipped in separate containers, with the warhead and motor assembled before issue and the igniter inserted immediately before use. The Little John differs from the Honest John in not only its size but how it is stabilized in flight. The flight of the Honest John is stabilized by a spin that is imparted to the rocket by spin rockets after the round leaves the launcher. The XM51 Little John rocket flight is stabilized by applying spin to the rocket while on the launcher, just before firing. This manual method of stabilization was called \\"spin-on-straight-rail\\" (SOSR). A hand-wound mechanical clock spring on the launcher rotates the missile through gears, when the firing lanyard is pulled. Once the rocket is rotating at 3 rev. per second, inertial switches connect the thermal batteries to the rocket motor's igniter. In flight, the spin is maintained by canted fins. The system was manufactured by the Douglas Aircraft Company. The missile and launcher system were light enough to be easily transported by helicopters and other aircraft or towed by a vehicle. The Phase II Little John weapon system was initially deployed with the 1st Missile Battalion, 57th Field Artillery in Okinawa, Japan. The missile was retired beginning in July, 1967, with the final missile removed from inventory in 1970. Five hundred missiles were produced during the life of the weapon program.

The Comancheros are participants in the United Motorcycle Council of NSW, which convened a conference in 2009 to address legislation aimed against the \\"bikie\\" clubs, their poor public image in the wake of several violent clashes and ongoing biker wars, and defusing deadly feuds such as the Comancheros' battles with the Hells Angels. The sincerity of these efforts to defend the battered image of the clubs has been met with skepticism. History William George \\"Jock\\" Ross, a Scottish immigrant, formed the club in Sydney, New South Wales in 1968. He chose the name after seeing the 1961 John Wayne film The Comancheros. (However, there already existed a Californian motorcycle club of the same name, first mentioned in a 1965 article by Hunter S. Thompson, and in his book \\"Hell's Angels\\" a year later.) In late 1982 a second Comanchero chapter was formed by Anthony Mark \\"Snoddy\\" Spencer, who had broken away from the first chapter after challenging Ross' authority. When visiting the United States with Charles Paul \\"Charlie\\" Scibberas, another member of the second chapter, Spencer met with members of the Texan motorcycle club, the Bandidos and the two gangs became allies. The Bandidos eventually patched-over the second Comanchero chapter to become the Bandidos' first Australian chapter. The Comancheros and Bandidos were now rivals, and in September 1984 the two clubs were involved in the Milperra massacre, a shoot-out which left seven people dead, including four Comancheros, two Bandidos, and a 14-year-old bystander. Jock Ross received a lifetime jail-sentence for his involvement in the Milperra massacre but only served five years and three months before he was released. The Comancheros and Hells Angels became involved in a clash at Sydney Airport on 22 March 2009. Terminal 3 was the scene of a brawl involving 10 people in the two rival bikie gangs. The brawl left one man, Anthony Zervas, dead. The fighting was witnessed by over 50 travellers, CCTV cameras and airport staff, including airport security, who could do little to intervene. The security staff were unarmed and Australian Federal Police arrived late. Six Comancheros were arrested as a result of the altercation and convicted of \\"riot and affray\\". In November 2011 Comancheros leader Mahmoud \\"Mick\\" Hawi was found guilty of affray and murder, but in May 2014 the murder conviction was overturned on appeal and a retrial ordered. Hawi pleaded guilty to manslaughter and in March 2015 he was sentenced to a minimum of 3.5 years jail.R v Hawi (2015), austlii.edu.au; accessed 6 March 2016. In February 2018 Hawi was shot dead, at age 37, whilst sitting in his car outside a gym in Rockdale, NSW. In late 2009 Duax Ngakuru was elected as national president. Four years later Mick Murray was elected. Perth chapter The Comancheros established a single Western Australian chapter in 2010 which is located on Wellman Street, Northbridge, at the Fitness and Fight Centre.Bikies fly in for club celebration, au.news.yahoo.com; accessed 1 September 2015. The Comanchero expansion into Western Australia was delayed by the 2010 arrest of Steve Milenkovski who was about to be patched as the Perth's Chapter president when he was arrested in the culmination of Operation Baystone.Halting steps mark bikie battle, au.news.yahoo.com; accessed 1 September 2015. Operation Baystone resulted in Milenkovski, Yavuz Ozan, Hao Bi, and Mark Vick Kitos being charged with various drug offences. The operation seized 7.5 kilograms of methylamphetamine imported into Western Australia from New South Wales. In August 2012 Milenkovski was found guilty of two counts of Possess a Prohibited Drug with Intent to Sell or Supply after a 9-week Perth District Court trial and sentenced to 17 years jail as the \\"king pin\\". Two of his co-accused, were convicted of one charge each of attempted possession including David Tanevski who was sentenced to eight years' jail. Hao Bi, who was alleged to have been the courier was acquitted.Three men guilty of drugs charges, ABC.net.au; accessed 1 September 2015. In May 2014 eight men including two patched members of the Comanchero were charged for allegedly extorting businesses in Northbridge. Infighting On 5 September 2012, Comanchero member Faalau Pisu was murdered, being shot in the head outside the Serbian National Defence Council at Canley Vale, New South Wales whilst attending a wedding. A 25-year- old gang member and a 27-year-old associate of the club were also shot and injured.

Picture by Frances Frith The known history of Gaza spans 4,000 years. Gaza was ruled, destroyed and repopulated by various dynasties, empires, and peoples. Originally a Canaanite settlement, it came under the control of the ancient Egyptians for roughly 350 years before being conquered and becoming one of the Philistines' principal cities. Gaza fell to the Israelites in about 1000 BCE but became part of the Assyrian Empire around 730 BCE. Alexander the Great besieged and captured the city in 332 BCE. Most of the inhabitants were killed during the assault, and the city, which became a center for Hellenistic learning and philosophy, was resettled by nearby Bedouins. The area changed hands regularly between two Greek successor-kingdoms, the Seleucids of Syria and the Ptolemies of Egypt, until it was besieged and taken by the Hasmoneans in 96 BCE. Gaza was rebuilt by Roman General Pompey Magnus, and granted to Herod the Great thirty years later. Throughout the Roman period, Gaza maintained its prosperity, receiving grants from several different emperors. A 500-member senate governed the city, which had a diverse population of Greeks, Romans, Jews, Egyptians, Persians and Nabateans. Conversion to Christianity in the city was spearheaded and completed under Saint Porphyrius, who destroyed its eight pagan temples between 396 and 420 CE. Gaza was conquered by the Muslim general Amr ibn al-'As in 637 CE, and most Gazans adopted Islam during early Muslim rule. Thereafter, the city went through periods of prosperity and decline. The Crusaders wrested control of Gaza from the Fatimids in 1100, but were driven out by Saladin. Gaza was in Mamluk hands by the late 13th century, and became the capital of a province that stretched from the Sinai Peninsula to Caesarea. It witnessed a golden age under the Ottoman-appointed Ridwan dynasty in the 16th century. Gaza experienced destructive earthquakes in 1903 and 1914. In 1917, during World War I, British forces captured the city. Gaza grew significantly in the first half of the 20th century under Mandatory rule. The population of the city swelled as a result of the Palestinian exodus during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Gaza came under Egyptian rule until it was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. Gaza became a center of political activism during the First Intifada, and under the Oslo Accords of 1993, it was assigned to be under the direct control of the newly established Palestinian Authority. Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005. By 2007, Hamas emerged both as the victor in Palestinian elections and in factional fighting with rival Fatah in the city and in the wider Gaza Strip and has since been the sole governing authority. Israel subsequently blockaded the Strip and launched assaults against it in 2008‚Äì2009, 2012 and 2014, as a response to rocket attacks. Bronze Age Settlement in the region of Gaza dates back to 3300‚Äì3000 BCE at Tell as-Sakan, a site located south of the present-day city, which began as an Ancient Egyptian fortress built in Canaanite territory. Tell as-Sakan prospered as Canaanite cities began to trade agricultural goods with the Egyptians. However, when Egypt's economic interests shifted to the cedar trade with Lebanon, Gaza's role was reduced to that of a port for ships carrying goods and it declined economically. The site was virtually abandoned and remained so throughout the Early Bronze Age II. Gaza enjoyed demographic and economic growth again when the local Canaanite population began to resettle Tell as-Sakan around 2500, but in 2250, the area experienced a total collapse of civilization and all of the cities in the Gaza region were abandoned by the 23rd century BCE. In its place emerged semi-nomadic cultures with pastoral camps made up of rustic family dwellings which continued to exist throughout the Early Bronze Age IV. An urban center known as Tell al- Ajjul began to arise inland along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the Middle Bronze Age, Tell as-Sakan was the southernmost locality in Canaanite territory, serving as a fort, and by 1650 BCE, while Egypt was occupied by the Canaanite Hyksos, a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as- Sakan. This city was destroyed about a century later, when the Hyksos were routed from Egypt. Egypt settled Gaza once again and Tell al-Ajjul rose for the third time in the 15th century BCE. The city finally ceased to exist in the 14th century, at the end of the Bronze Age. Ancient period Statue of Zeus unearthed in Gaza A city which would become present-day Gaza began to develop on the site of Tell al-Ajjul. This city served as Egypt's administrative capital in Canaan, and was the residence of the Egyptian governor of the region. A caravan point of strategic importance from the earliest times, it was constantly involved in the wars between Egypt and Syria and the Mesopotamian powers, and appeared frequently in Egyptian and Assyrian records. Under Tuthmosis III, it is mentioned on the Syrian-Egyptian caravan route and in the Amarna letters as \\"Azzati\\". Gaza was in Egyptian hands for 350 years, until it was settled by the Philistines, a seafaring people with cultural links to the Aegean, in the 12th century BCE. It then became a part of the pentapolis; a league of the Philistines' five most important city- states. The Hebrew Bible mentions the Avvites occupying an area that extended as far as Gaza, and that these people were dispossessed by the Caphtorites from the island of Caphtor (modern Crete). Some scholars speculate that the Philistines were descendants of the Caphtorites. Gaza is also mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the place where Samson was imprisoned and met his death. The prophets Amos and Zephaniah are believed to have prophesied that Gaza would be deserted.Zev Vilnay, The Guide to Israel, Jerusalem, Hamakor, 1970, pp.298‚Äì299 According to biblical accounts, Gaza fell to Israelite rule, from the reign of King David in the early 11th century BCE. When the United Monarchy split in about 930 BCE, Gaza became a part of the northern Kingdom of Israel. When the Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser III and Sargon II around 730 BCE, Gaza came under Assyrian rule. In the 7th century, it again came under Egyptian control, but during the Persian period (6th-4th centuries BCE) it enjoyed a certain independence and flourished. In 529 BCE, Cambyses I unsuccessfully attacked Gaza and later, around 520 BCE, the Greeks established a trading post in Gaza. The first coins were minted on the Athens model around 380 BCE. Alexander the Great besieged Gaza‚Äîthe last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt‚Äîfor five months, finally capturing it in 332 BCE. Led by a eunuch named Batis and defended by Arab mercenaries, Gaza withstood the siege for two months, until it was overcome by storm. The defenders, mostly local elements, fought to the death and the women and children were taken as captives. The city was resettled by neighboring Bedouins,Bury, John Bagnell.The Cambridge Ancient History. Cambridge University Press, p. 147. who were sympathetic to Alexander's rule. He then organized the city into a polis or \\"city-state\\" and Greek culture took root in Gaza which gained a reputation as a flourishing center of Hellenic learning and philosophy.Ring, 1996, p. 287. Belonging at first to the Ptolemaic kingdom, it passed after 200 BCE to the Seleucids. In the 1st century BCE and the first half of that century, it was the Mediterranean port of the Nabateans, whose caravans arrived there from Petra or from Elath on the Red Sea. In 96 BCE, the Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus besieged the city for a year. The inhabitants, who had hoped for help from the Nabatean king Aretas II, were killed and their city destroyed by Jannaeus when Aretas did not come to their aid.(Josephus, Antiq. XIII, 360), (Josephus, Antiq. XIII, 364), (Josephus, Antiq. XIII, 357; War I,87) Classical antiquity Roman rule Gaza was rebuilt by consul Aulus Gabinius after it was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 63 BCE, under the command of Pompey Magnus. Roman rule brought six centuries of relative peace and prosperity to the city‚Äîwhich became a busy port and locus of trade between the Middle East and Africa. In the Acts of the Apostles, Gaza is mentioned as being on the desert route from Jerusalem to Ethiopia. The Christian gospel was explained to an Ethiopian eunuch along this road by Philip the Evangelist, and he was baptised in some nearby water. Gaza was granted to Herod the Great by Roman emperor Augustus in 30 BCE, where it formed a separate unit within his kingdom; and Cosgabar, the governor of Idumea, was in charge of the city's affairs. On the division of Herod's kingdom, it was placed under the proconsul of Syria. After Herod's death in 4 BCE, Augustus annexed it to the Province of Syria. In 66 CE, Gaza was burned down by Jews during their rebellion against the Romans. However, it remained an important city; even more so after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus the following year.Dowling, 1913, p.33. Titus passed through Gaza on his march toward to Jerusalem, and again in his return. The establishment of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea restored trade links with Petra and Aila.Meyer, 1907, p.58. Throughout the Roman period, Gaza was a prosperous city and received grants and attention from several emperors. A 500-member senate governed Gaza, and a diverse variety of Philistines, Greeks, Romans, Canaanites, Phoenicians, Jews, Egyptians, Persians and Bedouin populated the city. Gaza's mint stamped out coins adorned with the busts of gods and emperors. During his visit in 130 CE, Emperor Hadrian, who favored Gaza, personally inaugurated wrestling, boxing and oratorical competitions in Gaza's new stadium, which soon became known from Alexandria to Damascus. The city was adorned with many pagan temples‚Äîthe main cult being that of Marnas. Other temples were dedicated to Zeus, Helios, Aphrodite, Apollo, Athena and the local deity Tyche. The spread of Christianity in Gaza was initiated by Philip the Arab around 250 CE; first in the port of Maiuma, but later into the city. The religion faced obstacles as it spread through the inland population because pagan worship was strong. In 299, an unverified number of local Christians who assembled in Gaza to hear the Scriptures read were seized and mutilated by the Romans.Meyer, 1907, pp. 59-61. Also, its Christians were harshly repressed during the Diocletianic Persecution in 303. The first bishop of Gaza was Philemon, believed to have been one of the 72 disciples, but the first cleric was Saint Silvanus who, during the persecution by Maximinianus in 310, was arrested along with about 30 other Christians, and condemned to death. Byzantine rule and advent of Christianity On the breakup of the Roman Empire, Gaza became part of the Byzantine Empire as part of the Palaestina Prima province. The official recognition of Christianity by Constantine I did not increase sympathy of the religion in Gaza. Although Gaza was represented by Bishop Asclepas in the First Council of Nicaea in 325, the vast majority of its inhabitants continued to worship the native gods. As the Roman Empire was crumbling at this time, Gaza remained unaffected. At this time, the inhabitants of Maiuma reportedly converted to Christianity en masse. Constantine II decided to separate it from pagan Gaza in 331, giving Maiuma its own episcopal see. Julian reversed the process during his reign in the latter half of the 4th century. Although Maiuma had its own bishop, clergy, and diocesan territory, it shared its magistrates and administration with Gaza.Bitton-Ashkelony and Kofsky, 2004, p.45. Upon Julian's death, Maiuma's independence was restored and the rivalry between it and Gaza intensified. During most of the 4th century, the Christian community was small, poor, and carried no influence in the city. The church was insignificant and its members were not allowed to hold political office.Meyer, 1907, p.63. However, conversion to Christianity in Gaza was spearheaded under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420. In 402, after obtaining a decree from the emperor, he ordered all eight of the city's Pagan temples destroyed and non-Christian worship was forbidden by the Byzantine government, replacing persecution of the Christians with persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. Paganism continued despite persecution, and according to the traditional Christian history, Christians were still persecuted in the city, resulting in St. Porphyrius to undertake more measures.Meyer, 1907, pp.63‚Äì64. As a result of his persuasion, Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas in 406.Pringle, 1993, p.208 Note, that according to MacMullen it is likely that Porphyrius did not even exist.MacMullen, Ramsay. Christianizing the Roman Empire. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1984, pp. 86‚Äì89 The alleged persecution against Christians, according to traditional Christian history, did not cease, but it was less harsh and frequent than previously. A large 6th century synagogue with a mosaic tile floor depicting King David was discovered in Gaza. An inscription states that the floor was donated in 508‚Äì509 CE by two merchant brothers. King David playing the Lyre, Israel Museum, Jerusalem Around 540, Gaza became the starting point for pilgrimages to the Sinai Peninsula. It was an important city in the early Christian world and many famous scholars taught at its academy of rhetoric, including 6th-century scholar Procopius of Gaza. The celebrated Church of Saint Sergius was built in this century. Depicted in the mosaic Map of Madaba of 600, Gaza was the most important political and commercial center on the southern coast of Palestine. Its northern municipal border was marked by Wadi al-Hesi, just before Ashkelon, and its southern boundary is unknown, but Gaza's jurisdiction did not reach Raphia. The towns of Bethelea, Asalea, Gerarit and Kissufim were included in Gaza's territories.Bitton-Ashkelony and Kofsky, 2004, pp.43-46. Its large representation, approximately half of which is preserved, cannot be easily explained, mainly because only small tentative excavations have been made there and because Byzantine Gaza is covered by the still inhabited Old City. Arab caliphates Rashidun rule There were already converts to Islam among the city's Greek-speaking Christian population before Gaza's capitulation to the Muslims. At the near end of the Byzantine era, Gaza had become the home of an increasingly influential group of Arab traders from Mecca, including Umar ibn al-Khattab, who later became the second ruler of the Islamic Caliphate. Muhammad visited the city more than once before being a prophet of Islam. In 634, Gaza was besieged by the Rashidun army under general 'Amr ibn al-'As, with assistance from Khalid ibn al-Walid, following the Battle of Ajnadayn between the Byzantine Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate in central Palestine.al-Biladhuri quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. xix. Al- Biladhuri lists the cities captured by Amr ibn al-'As as Ghazzah (Gaza), Sebastiya (Sebastia, Nabulus, Amwas (Imwas), Kaisariyya (Caesarea), Yibna, Ludd (Lydda), Rafh (Rafah), Bayt Jibrin, and Yaffa (Jaffa). The Muslims' victory at Ajnadayn gave them control over much of Palestine's countryside, but not the major cities with garrisons such as Gaza. With Umar succeeding Abu Bakr as caliph (head of the Caliphate), the Rashidun forces began to make stronger efforts at conquering Byzantine territory.Filiu, 2014, pp. 18‚Äì19. During the three-year siege of Gaza, the city's Jewish community fought alongside the Byzantine garrison. In the summer of 637, Amr's forces broke the siege and captured Gaza, killing its Byzantine garrison, but not attacking its inhabitants.Filiu, 2014, p. 19. Amr's victory is attributed to a combination of Arab strategy, Byzantine weakness, and the influence of Gaza's Arab residents. Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf‚Äîwho also lived as a merchant in Gaza‚Äîwas buried, the city was not destroyed by the victorious Arab army.Ring, 1996, p. 289. The arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought drastic changes to Gaza; its churches were transformed into mosques, including the Cathedral of John the Baptist (previously the Temple of Marnas) which became the Great Mosque of Gaza. Gaza's population adopted Islam as their religion relatively quick in contrast with the city's countryside. Eventually,Sharon, 2009, p. 23. Arabic became the official language. The Christian population was reduced to an insignificant minority and the Samaritan residents deposited their property with their high priest and fled the city east upon the Muslim conquest.Meyer, 1907, p. 71. Gaza was placed under the administration of Jund Filastin (\\"District of Palestine\\") of Bilad al-Sham province during Rashidun rule, and continued to be a part of the district under the successive caliphates of the Umayyads and Abbasids.al-Muqaddasi quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. 39. Arab dynasties Under the Umayyads Gaza served as a minor administrative center. In 672 an earthquake struck the city but there are few details of its effects. Under the caliph-appointed governors, Christians and Jews were taxed, though their worship and trade continued, as noted in the writings of the bishop Saint Willibald, who visited the city in 723.Meyer, 1907, p. 76. The year 750 saw the end of Umayyad rule in Palestine and the arrival of the Abbasids, with Gaza becoming a center for the writing of Islamic law. In 767, Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; al- Shafi'i founded one of the prominent fiqhs (schools of law) of Sunni Islam, named Shafi'i after him.Gil, 1992, p. 292. In 796 the city was laid waste during a civil war by the Arab tribes of the area.Dowling, 1913, p. 37. Gaza apparently recovered by the 9th century according to Persian geographer Istakhri who wrote that merchants grew rich there \\"for this place was a great market for the people of the Hejaz.\\"Istakhri and Ibn Hauqal quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. 442. A Christian writer, writing in 867, described it as \\"rich in all things\\". Gaza's port, however, occasionally succumbed to neglect under Arab rule and an overall decline in commerce followed because of infighting among Palestine's rulers and Bedouin bandits who disrupted overland trade routes towards the city. From 868 to 905 the Tulunids ruled Gaza, and around 909, the influence of the Fatimids from Egypt started to grow, leading to a slow decline of the city. The orange was introduced to the area, arriving from India in 943. In 977, the Fatimids established an agreement with the Seljuk Turks, whereby the Fatimids would control Gaza and the land south of it, including Egypt.Gil, 1992, p. 349. By the 985 CE, while under Fatimid rule, the Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi described Gaza as \\"a large town lying on the highroad to Egypt on the border of the desert. There is here a beautiful mosque, also to be seen is the monument for the Khalif Umar.\\"al- Muqaddasi quoted in le Strange, 1890, p. 442. The Arabic-language poet Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al-Ghazzi was born in the city in 1049.Meyer, 1907, p. 78. Crusader and Ayyubid rule The Gold Market in Gaza dates from the Mamluk period The Crusaders wrested control of Gaza from the Fatimids in 1100. According to the chronicler William of Tyre, the Crusaders found it uninhabited and in ruins. Unable to totally refortify the hilltop on which Gaza was built, due to a lack of resources, King Baldwin III built a small castle there in 1149. The possession of Gaza completed the military encirclement of the Fatimid-held city of Ascalon to the north. After the castle's construction, Baldwin granted it and the surrounding region to the Knights Templar. He also had the Great Mosque converted into the Cathedral of Saint John. In 1154, the Arab traveler al-Idrisi wrote Gaza \\"is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders.\\"Yaqut al-Hamawi quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.442. William of Tyre confirms that in 1170, a civilian population was persuaded to occupy the area outside the castle and establish feeble fortifications and gates surrounding the community. That same year, King Amalric I of Jerusalem withdrew Gaza's Templars to assist him against an Egypt-based Ayyubid force led by Saladin at nearby Darum. However, Saladin evaded the Crusader force and assaulted Gaza instead, destroying the town built outside the castle's walls and killing its inhabitants after they were refused refuge in the castle, managed by Miles of Plancy at the time. Seven years later, the Templars prepared for another defense of Gaza against Saladin, but this time his forces fell on Ascalon. In 1187, following Ascalon's capitulation, the Templars surrendered Gaza in return for the release of their master Gerard of Ridefort. Saladin then ordered the destruction of the city's fortifications in 1191. A year later, after recapturing it, Richard the Lionheart apparently refortified the city, but the walls were dismantled as a result of the Treaty of Ramla agreed upon months later in 1193. According to geographer Abu al-Fida, Gaza was a medium-sized city, possessing gardens and a seashore in the early 13th century.Abu al-Fida quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.442. The Ayyubids constructed the Shuja'iyya neighborhood‚Äîthe first extension of Gaza beyond the Old City.Haldimann and Humbert, 2007, p.195. Mamluk rule Ayyubid rule virtually ended in 1260, after the Mongols under Hulagu Khan completely destroyed Gaza‚ÄîHulagu's southernmost point of conquest. Hulagu left his army in Gaza after being recalled due to the death of the Mongol emperor, and Mamluk general az-Zahir Baybars subsequently drove the Mongols out of the city and again defeated them at Baysan in the Galilee. He was proclaimed sultan of Egypt on his way back from the battlefield after the assassination of Sultan Qutuz. Baibars passed through Gaza six times during his expeditions against the remnants of the Crusader states and the Mongols between 1263 and 1269.Meyer, 1907, pp.85-86. Mamluk domination started in 1277, with Gaza initially being a small village in the territory of Ramla. In 1279, Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun encamped in Gaza for fifty days while on a march against the Mongols. In 1293, Qalawun's son an-Nasir Muhammad instituted Gaza as the capital of the province that bore its name, Mamlakat Ghazzah (the Governorship of Gaza). This province covered the coastal plain from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, extending in the east to the western slopes of Samaria and the Hebron Hills; its major towns were Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla.Sharon, 1997, pp.XII-XIII. In 1294, an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that was restored by the Mamluks. That same year, Gaza was the center of a conspiracy against Sultan al-Adil Kitbugha, but the plot was detected and crushed before being carried out. The Syrian geographer al-Dimashqi described Gaza in 1300 as \\"so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land\\". He accounted to Gaza the cities and towns of Ascalon, Jaffa, Caesarea, Arsuf, Deir al-Balah, al-Arish (in north-central the Sinai), Bayt Jibrin, Karatiyya, Hebron and Jerusalem‚Äîall of which had their own sub- governors. Emir Baibars al-Ala'i ruled Mamlakat Ghazzah between 1307‚Äì1310, during the second reign of an-Nasir Muhammad until the latter was briefly overthrown by Baybars al-Jashnakir.Sharon, 2009, p. 83. Gaza was one of the places that returned to the allegiance of the exiled sultan; in 1310, an-Nasir Muhammad defeated Sultan Baybars in Gaza, forcing the latter to surrender his throne to him. Baybars was imprisoned in the city.Meyer, 1907, p.87. Emir Sanjar al-Jawli acquired the governorship of Gaza and central Palestine in 1311. He highly favored Gaza and transformed it into a flourishing city, having built in it a horse-race course, a madrasa (college), a mosque, a khan (caravansary), a maristan (hospital), and a castle.Meyer, 1907, p.83. In late 1332, coinciding with the appointment of Emir Taynal al-Ashrafi as governor, some of the provincial privileges of Gaza, such as the governor's direct subordination to the sultan in Cairo, were removed by an-Nasir Muhammad's decree. From then, and until 1341 when Sanjar al-Jawli served a second term as governor, Gaza became subordinate to the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Syria, Emir Tankiz al-Husami.Sharon, 2009, p. 101. In 1348 the bubonic plague spread to the city, killing the majority of its inhabitants, and in 1352, Gaza suffered a destructive flood‚Äîwhich was rare in that arid part of Palestine.Ring, 1996, p.290. However, by 1355, the Berber traveler Ibn Battuta visited the city and noted that it was \\"large and populous, and has many mosques. But there were no walls round it. There was here of old a fine Jami' Mosque (the Great Mosque), but the one present[ly] used was built by Amir Jawli [Sanjar al-Jawli].\\"Ibn Battuta quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.442. In the early 1380s, the governor of Gaza, Akbuga Safawi, plotted to commit treason against Sultan az-Zahir Barquq. The plot was detected and Safawi was exiled to al-Karak, and replaced by Husam al-Din ibn Bakish. Soon after, the city fell into the hands of Emir Yalbugha an-Nasiri who revolted against Barquq. Gaza was retaken without violence, and Ibn Bakish met Yalbugha at its gates with gifts and proposals of peace. The unseated Barquq regained his throne in 1389, and retook Gaza the next year.Meyers, 1907, pp.90‚Äì91. In 1401 a swarm of locusts destroyed Gaza's crops. A battle between the rival Mamluk emirs Akbirdi and Qansuwa Khamsiyah occurred in Gaza; Khamsiyah had failed in usurping the Mamluk throne and fled to Gaza where he made his unsuccessful last stand.Meyers, 1907, p. 97. Between 1428 and 1433, Gaza was governed by Emir Sayf ad-Din Inal, who would later become sultan in 1453.Sharon, 2009, p. 162. During his sultanate, in 1455, Inal's dawadar (executive secretary) had the Madrasa of Birdibak built in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood.Sharon, 2009, p. 166 Ottoman era Early Ottoman rule and the Ridwan dynasty In 1516, Gaza‚Äîby now a small town with an inactive port, ruined buildings and reduced trade‚Äîwas incorporated into the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising,Ze'evi, 1996, p.2. and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow Sunni Muslims. Shortly after Palestine's quick submission to the Ottomans, it was divided into six districts, including the Gaza Sanjak (District of Gaza) which stretched from Jaffa in the north to Bayt Jibrin in the east and Rafah in the south. The sanjak was a part of the larger Damascus Eyalet or the \\"Province of Damascus\\".Doumani, 1995, p.35. An early governor of Gaza Sanjak was Kara Shahin Mustafa, a former jannissary (member of a military corps) who rose to become an elite military officer and state minister and eventually a vizier and trusted aide of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.Ze'evi, 1996, p.52. He received the governorship of Gaza apparently as an interim appointment before he was appointed Governor of Egypt, although he was deposed three years later by Sultan Selim II. Mustafa died a short while later and his son Ridwan Pasha, who was the treasurer of Yemen, became governor shortly before Mustafa's death. The Ridwan dynasty, which would rule Gaza for over a century, derives its name from Ridwan Pasha. He was later appointed Governor of Yemen, but was deposed two years later and returned to the governorship of Gaza. After becoming governor of Ethiopia, Basra, and Diyarbakƒ±r in that order, he successfully led an Ottoman contingent against Safavid Persia in 1579. The sultan then awarded him the province of Anatolia where he died in 1585.Ze'evi, 1996, p.40. Although no explanation is provided in the biographies of the Ridwan family, it is evident they chose Gaza as their home and the place for their castle. Ridwan Pasha's son Ahmad Pasha succeeded him and governed Gaza for thirty years, sometimes incorporating the sanjaks of Nablus and Jerusalem. He became Governor of Damascus Eyalet in 1601 after bribing several viziers and bureaucrats in Istanbul and died in 1607. Next in line was Hasan Pasha ibn Ahmad who became known 'Arab Hasan (\\"Hasan the Bedouin\\") because by then, the Ridwans were identified with the control and knowledge of the Bedouin. He successfully led his pro-Ottoman Bedouin troops against the army of the rebel Fakhr ad-Din in a series of battles. He was later appointed Governor of Tripoli in Lebanon, but he was deposed in 1644. 'Arab Hasan had many wives and concubines and 85 children. He led the Ridwans successfully militarily, however, he burdened the dynasty with heavy debt.Ze'evi, 1996, p.41. Muslims studying the Qur'an with Gaza in the background, painting by Harry Fenn 'Arab Hasan's son Husayn Pasha was governor of Nablus and Jerusalem, and inherited the impoverished governorship of Gaza when his father died. He borrowed a large sum from the French in order to meet the heavy taxes imposed on the city by Hassan Aga, governor Sidon Eyalet‚Äîthe province that Gaza briefly belonged to.Meyer, 1907, p.98. Husayn's period in office was peaceful and prosperous for the city, and he gained a good reputation for considerably reducing the strife between the nearby Bedouins and the settled population. He appointed his son Ibrahim to be governor of the Gaza and Jerusalem sanjaks, but when Ibrahim was killed during an expedition against the Druze in Mount Lebanon in 1660, Husayn resumed control of Gaza. That year, Gaza was designated the capital of Palestine, indicating the city's rapid recovery. The Great Mosque was restored, and six other mosques constructed, while Turkish baths and market stalls proliferated. Anonymous petitions from Damascus sent to Istanbul complaining about Husayn's failure to protect the Hajj caravan and his alleged pro-Christian tendencies, however, served as an excuse for the Ottoman government to depose him. He was soon imprisoned in Damascus and his assets confiscated by provincial authorities. He was later sent to Istanbul and died in prison there in 1663. Husayn's brother Musa Pasha then governed Gaza into the early 1670s, implementing an anti-French and anti-Christian regime to appease the Ottoman government. Soon after his reign ended, Ottomans officials were appointed to govern. The Ridwan period is considered Gaza's last golden age during Ottoman rule and the city gradually dwindled after they were removed from office. In 1723, the Ottomans appointed Salih Pasha Tuqan of the Nablus-based Tuqan family to govern Gaza and two other sanjaks until his death in 1742.Doumani, 1995, p.38. In the 1750s, a local Bedouin tribes disposed of the plunder from a Meccan caravan, consisting of 13,000 camel-loads of goods, into Gaza's markets, boosting the city's wealth. The attack on the caravan was a reprisal to the Ottomans who had recently replaced the governor of Damascus. In 1763, there was a revolt in Gaza against the Ottomans.Meyer, 1907, p.100 Then, in November 1770, Ali Bey al-Kabir, the rebellious Mamluk sultan of Egypt, sent troops to Gaza to aid Zahir al-Umar in the Galilee, helping him check the power of the Ottomans in the Levant.Sabbagh, 2008, p.40. Gaza was briefly occupied by the French Army under Napoleon Bonaparte, who referred to it as \\"the outpost of Africa, the door to Asia\\", in 1799.Meyer, 1907, p.101. Most of its inhabitants fled as a result. His forces easily razed the remains of the city walls (which had not been rebuilt since their destruction by Saladin), but abandoned the city after their failed siege of Acre that same year. The duration of French influence in Gaza was too short to have a palpable effect. Egyptian rule and Ottoman revival David Roberts, 1839, in The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt from the early 19th century; Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered it and most of Palestine in 1832. Strangely, in 1833, Muhammad Ali instructed his son Ibrahim Pasha not to purchase Gaza's cotton harvest (cotton production was Ali's main source of wealth and Egypt's production was low that year), instead allowing its residents to dispose of it how they wished.Doumani, 1995, p.102. American scholar Edward Robinson visited Gaza in 1838, describing it as a \\"thickly populated\\" town larger than Jerusalem, with its Old City lying upon a hilltop, while its suburbs laid on the nearby plain.Robinson, 1841, p.37. He further stated that its soil was rich and supported groves of \\"delicious and abundant\\" apricots and mulberries. Although Gaza's port was by then inactive, it benefited from trade and commerce because of its position on the caravan route between Egypt and Syria, as well as from the production of soap and cotton for trade with the Bedouin.Robinson, 1841, p.39. The governor of Gaza at the time was Sheikh Sa'id. Robinson noted that virtually all of Gaza's vestiges of ancient history and antiquity had disappeared due to constant conflict and occupation.Robinson, 1841, p.38. The Bubonic Plague struck again in 1839 and the city stagnated, as it lacked political and economic stability. In 1840, Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza, with the Ottomans emerging victorious, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. The battles brought about more death and destruction, just barely after the city began to recover from the plague. The Church of Saint Porphyrius was renovated in 1856,Dumper an Abu-Lughod, 2007, p.155. and in 1874, French orientalist Charles Clermont-Ganneau visited Gaza, gathering and cataloging a sizable collection of Byzantine inscriptions and describing the city's Great Mosque in detail. Sultan Abdul Hamid II had the wells of Gaza restored in 1893. The Great Mosque of Gaza was heavily damaged during World War I Although the first municipal council of Gaza was formed in 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa, modern mayorship began in 1906 with his son Said al-Shawa, who was appointed mayor by Ottoman authorities.Mayors of Gaza Gaza Municipality. Like other regions and cities in Palestine at the time, Gaza was economically and politically dominated by a number of powerful clans, particularly the Shawa, Husseini, and Sourani families.Feldman, 2008, p.21. Two destructive earthquakes occurred in 1903 and 1914. When World War I erupted in 1917, British forces were defeated by the Ottomans in the first and second Battle of Gaza. General Edmund Allenby, leading the Allied Forces, finally conquered Gaza in a third battle. British rule Gaza after surrender to British forces, 1918 After the war, the League of Nations granted quasi-colonial authority over former Ottoman territories to Great Britain and France; Gaza was included in the British Mandate of Palestine. The Jewish Quarter of Gaza was destroyed in the 1929 Palestine riots and most of Gaza's fifty Jewish families fled the city. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion, with new neighborhoods, such as Rimal and Zeitoun being built along the coast, and the southern and eastern plains. Areas damaged in the riots also went through reconstruction. Most of the funding for these developments came from international organizations and missionary groups. Egyptian control As a result of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Egypt obtained control of Gaza and the surrounding area. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of refugees fleeing nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. From 1948 through 1959, Gaza was nominally under the jurisdiction of the All-Palestine Government, an entity established by the Arab League during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, purportedly to provide a Palestinian government for Palestine. However, the members of the Government were removed to Cairo, and had little or no influence over events in Gaza. Egyptian occupation of the Gaza Strip was interrupted for four months during the 1956 Suez Crisis. Upon the withdrawal of Israeli forces, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser issued several reforms in Gaza, including the expansion of educational opportunities and civil services, provision of housing and the establishment of local security forces. As in Egypt, political activity in Gaza was severely curtailed, but the government-sponsored Arab National Union was established in place of the All-Palestine Government that Nasser abolished in 1959, which gave the city's citizens a greater voice in national politics. In 1959, with the abolishment of the All-Palestine Government, Gaza had officially become a part of the United Arab Republic, a union of Syria and Egypt, under the pan-Arab policy of Nasser. In reality however, Gaza turned to be under direct Egyptian military governorship, which also continued upon the withdrawal of Syria from the UAR shortly afterwards. When the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded in 1964, Nasser formally, but not practically, proclaimed that it would hold authority over Gaza, and a year later, conscription was instituted for the Palestinian Liberation Army.Feldman, 2008, pp.8‚Äì9. Israeli control The newly appointed mayor of Gaza, Rushdi al-Shawwa, speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the Gaza municipal council, 26 November 1956 Gaza was occupied by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War after the defeat of a coalition of Arab armies. Under Israeli occupation, existing structures of administration in Gaza would be maintained and administrative tasks would continue to be executed by Palestinian civil servants. Although this policy of \\"government but not administration\\" was declared, some felt that the Israeli military frequently interfered in the city's administration in order to control local violent incidents. In the immediate aftermath of the 1967 War, the military governor of Gaza threatened to dismiss the municipal council and cut off utility services if the local leadership was unable to force the residents of the city to turn in their weapons. This action was deemed excessive and was revoked by the Israeli military governor of the Gaza Strip, however. Organized armed struggle against Israel peaked between 1969 and 1971, but was largely crushed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) under the command of Ariel Sharon.Feldman, 2008, pp.226‚Äì227. Ehud Yaari recounted that \\"by the beginning of 1970, 90% of Arab terrorism in Gaza was directed against Arab men and women employed by Israeli companies.\\" In 1971, the Israeli Army attempted to disperse the high concentration of Palestinian refugees in al-Shati camp and developed new housing schemes that resulted in the establishment of the northern Sheikh Radwan district. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the PLO were vociferous in their opposition to the move, claiming it was forced resettlement.Karmi and Cotran, 1999, p.33. In 1972, Gaza's military governor dismissed the city's mayor, Rashad al-Shawwa, for refusing to annex al-Shati camp to the municipality of Gaza.Feldman, 2008, p.228. Since the 1970s, frequent conflicts erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city, leading to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza became a center of confrontation during this uprising, and consequently, economic conditions in the city worsened. Palestinian control Palestinian Authority In September 1993, leaders of Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo Accords calling for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. Led by Yasser Arafat, the PNA chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996. Palestinians in a Gaza neighborhood during the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel-Gaza conflict (Source: Al Jazeera English) In 2005 the Israeli cabinet withdrew its military and settlements from the Gaza Strip including the Philadelphi Route, a narrow strip adjacent to the border with Egypt, as part of its unilateral disengagement plan. Since the Palestinian organization, Hamas won a surprise victory in the Palestinian elections of 2006, it has been engaged in a violent power struggle with rival Palestinian organization Fatah. Hamas administration In 2007, Hamas overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Currently, Hamas has de facto control of the city and Strip. Israel bombarded Gaza and nearby cities in the Gaza Strip in an air and ground assault codenamed \\"Operation Summer Rains\\" with the aim to end continued Qassam rocket attacks launched by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and to secure the release of an Israeli soldier captured by Palestinian militants. In March 2008, a human rights coalition charged that the humanitarian situation in Gaza had reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War. On December 27‚Äì28, 2008 Israel commenced air strikes against Gaza, codenamed \\"Operation Cast Lead\\". Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military excursions and the blockade of the Gaza Strip. By January 3, 2009, Israeli tanks and infantry were invading Gaza with air and naval support. Thirteen Israelis, including ten soldiers were killed, while, according to Palestinian sources, a total of more than 1,300 Palestinians were killed and 5,500 injured. In addition 4,000 buildings were destroyed and 20,000 damaged throughout the Gaza Strip. Israel began an operation in Gaza on 14 November 2012, lasting eight days. On 7 July 2014, Hamas took responsibility for rocket attacks against Israel after several of their members where killed, leading to Israel launching an operation the next day.Gaza‚ÄìIsrael conflict: Is the fighting over?

Although Wales lost the game, the margin was low and Douglas was re- selected for the very next Welsh international, this time to Scotland. Wales lost this game, but due to a dispute with Ireland failed to complete all the matches in the tournament. In the next year's tournament Douglas was selected for the first two games. The first was a drawn game against England at Llanelli, the country's best result to date against the English. His fourth and final game was the team's second game of the 1887 Championship, away to Scotland, which Wales again lost.

It was one of ten reservoirs built in open countryside in the valley between Crookes and Upperthorpe to supply water to the growing City of Sheffield in the 18th century. The Old Great Dam was built in 1785 with a capacity of and was thought big enough to supply the town for many years, however the ten reservoirs became obsolete by the 20th century and were all filled in with the exception of the Old Great Dam.Information board at park Gives information on history of park. The Old Great Dam was integrated into Crookes Valley Park when it was set out by Sheffield Corporation in the early years of the 20th century. For many years it was used as a boating lake and is still used for fishing, it is fed by a small stream which flows through a culvert into the western corner. The lake is said to be deep and there are unsubstantiated stories of large Pike and Zander living in the depths. On the south western fringe of the park is the Dam House bar and restaurant, a building of some antiquity. It was built in the 1780s when the Dam was being constructed and originally served as the house of the Water Board's solicitor.Friends of Crookesmoor Parks. Gives history of park and dams.

On 31 August 1869 he married Charlotte Jane Hook, the youngest daughter of Walter Farquhar Hook, the dean of Chichester. On the recommendation of the dean of Chichester in 1870, he became Vicar of Mid Lavant, a Lecturer at Chichester Theological College and Rector of Woolbeding\\"The Clergy List\\" William Clowes and Son,1879 Then in 1895 he was elevated to the Deanery at Winchester, a post he held until his death. Stephens was known for his philanthropy, spending his own money to have the church at Mid Lavant restored. He provided funds for the rebuilding of the chancel at Woolbeding and contributed to the repairs of the roof at Winchester Cathedral. He also spent a lot of time showing visitors around the cathedral and explaining its history. In 1895 he was recognised for his interest in history when he was elected FSA. In 1902 Stephens attended a mayoral banquet, in Winchester, where he consumed some oysters. Unfortunately the beds, in Emsworth where the oysters were sourced, had been contaminated with raw sewage. Consequently, many of the guests, including Stephens, contracted food poisoning. His death in Winchester deanery, on 22 December 1902, about six weeks after the banquet, was attributed to eating Emsworth oysters.

A third pillar was to have been the Global Trade Exchange (GTX), a data acquisition program which was funded as part of the Homeland Security Budget for 2008 and 2009, but is delayed and remains under study. The Secure Freight Initiative was kicked off in end-April 2007,http://www.apl.com/security/documents/sfi_dec0607.pdf with the commencement of the International Container Security project. The ICS is in pilot phases and is working to develop appropriate means to verify the safety of transport containers, using scanning technology including radiation portal monitors, non-intrusive imaging equipment, and optical character recognition systems. ICS is being implemented in foreign ports; Southampton (United Kingdom), Port Qasim (Pakistan), and Puerto Cortez (Honduras) will become the first seaports to implement the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) in October 2007.

The United States is Belize's principal trading partner and major source of investment funds. It is also home to the largest Belizean community outside Belize, estimated to be 70,000 strong.

Belize is the only country in Central America that has never received a visit from an American president. History International crime issues dominate the agenda of bilateral relations between the United States and Belize. The United States is working closely with the Government of Belize to fight illicit narcotics trafficking, and both governments seek to control the flow of illegal migrants to the United States through Belize. Belize and the United States brought into force a stolen vehicle treaty, an extradition treaty, and a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between 2001 and 2003. The United States is the largest provider of economic assistance to Belize, contributing $2.5 million in various bilateral economic and military aid. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) closed its Belize office in August 1996 after a 13-year program during which USAID provided $110 million worth of development assistance to Belize. Belize still benefits from USAID regional programs. In addition, Peace Corps volunteers have served in Belize since 1962. Until the end of 2002, Voice of America operated a medium-wave radio relay station in Punta Gorda that broadcast to the neighboring countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. The U.S. military has a diverse and growing assistance program in Belize that included the construction and renovation of several schools and youth hostels, medical assistance programs, and drug reduction programs.

Many of the ethnic groups in Northern Vietnam are Chinese-descended. However the Thai, among other ethnic groups that inhabit the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley and the surrounding highland regions, are not Chinese-descended. The Thai, along with other ethnic groups that inhabit the ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Province, are largely independent and follow their own series of customs and traditions. The Thai, among other non-Chinese minority ethnic groups in Vietnam such as the Tay, N√πng, Hmong, Muong, Cham, Khmer, Kohor, E De, Bahnar, and Jarai, have their own languages and writing systems. Belief holds that the Thai are originally descended from lowland natives of Zhuang- Dong origin. They were forced into the highlands by continuous invasions of the Mongoloid people of China. Much Thai folklore surrounds the history of the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley. According to Thai folklore, the Thai originally named the valley Muong Then (the land of God) sometimes spelt Muang Thaeng.As, for example, in the TAEC Museum in Luang Prabang, Laos The Vietnamese Government provides the following story about the history of the Thai people according to Thai folklore: While the Thai are the largest single ethnic group in the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley, the Hmong, Dao, and Day ethnic groups also inhabit the valley. There is also a substantial population of the Vietnamese ethnic majority group, Kinh, in the city of Dien Bien Phu.Logan, William S. Dien Bien Phu: Development and Conservation in a Vietnamese Cultural Landscape. Tech. Melbourne: Deakin University, 2006. Most of the groups in the regions follow animistic religious beliefs. There are also Catholics, Protestants, Buddhists, and Muslims. Political history Due to its location along the border with Laos and near the border with China, the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley and the surrounding region has had a long history of invasions and political change. In the 15th century the troops of Vietnamese Emperor L√™ L·ª£i allied with the indigenous inhabitants to expel the Chinese Ming invaders. Three hundred years later the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley came under the occupation of the Phe people from Laos. The Thai vigorously fought the Phe invaders and finally defeated them in 1751 with help from a peasant leader from Son Nam named Hoang Cong Chat. Until French rule began, the inhabitants of the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley and many of Vietnam's other highland minority groups were quite isolated from the lowland populations. When the French arrived in the nineteenth century they began to consolidate rule and contact between highland regions such as M∆∞·ªùng Thanh and the lowland regions increased. The French sought contacts with the Thai and other highland groups in order to cultivate their land. This often led to conflict between the French and the minority groups because the natives did not trust the French. After independence from the French, the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley fell under the rule of the North Vietnamese government and the inhabitants were given a certain degree of autonomy as a compromise for accepting the rule of the central government in Hanoi. Natural life Flowing through the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley is the Nam Rom River. The presence of the Nam Rom River in the valley makes the valley region highly fertile.\\"Dien Bien Phu City\\" Provinces and Cities. Vietnam National Administration of Tourism. 9 Feb. 2009 Much of the natural environment of the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley is jungle. The non-urbanized land in the valley is now largely used for agriculture, namely rice growing.Windrow, Martin. The Last Valley: Dien Bien Phu and the French Defeat in Vietnam. New York: Perseus Books Group, 2005. Economic development While the area surrounding the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley is largely rural and undeveloped, the valley itself is developed. The capital of the ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Province, the city of Dien Bien Phu, is located inside the valley. The Vietnamese government is working to develop theM∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley into a popular tourist destination. Many war veterans and other tourists come to the region to revisit the important sights of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. The Vietnamese government is now working to further develop the region's tourist infrastructure and appeal by promoting the diversity of local culture. The Vietnamese government is advertising local Thai culture in an effort to introduce outsiders to the local culture. In 2004 the Vietnam Administration of Tourism and the ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Province announced that that year would be the \\"Year of Dien Bien Tourism\\". This announcement came with a gift of around US$9500 to each commune in Dien Bien to build a commune hall to host visitors. These communes will showcase and introduce tourists to Thai culture. Trekking, mountain biking, and other nature-oriented tourist activities are also being promoted in the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley. Additionally, a commercial airport is located in the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley. The airport, located in Dien Bien Phu, offers flights to Hanoi. Rice farming also contributes to the local economy. Battle of Dien Bien Phu The First Indochina War began on December 19, 1946 as a battle between the French trying to regain their colonial claims in Vietnam and the Viet Minh attempting to gain control of the area. In the early 1950s Viet Minh forces were making steady advancements on French-controlled parts of Northern Vietnam. By late 1952 much of the Red River Delta was under Viet Minh control. Due to its proximity to supply routes from China, the M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley region was vital to the survival and support of the Viet Minh. The French forces in Vietnam under General Henri Navarre sought to occupy Dien Bien Phu. This would allow them to cut off an important supply route to the Viet Minh and also help them to fight against a Viet Minh offensive in Laos. Thus, in November 1953, French forces occupied the town of Dien Bien Phu and used their nearby military post at Lai Ch√¢u for reinforcement. Also during November 1953 the Northern Vietnamese Government indicated that it would examine diplomatic settlement proposals from the French. If the Vietnamese army could successfully attack a French-held zone leading up to the talks that were scheduled for April and May 1954, they felt that they would have enough leverage to broker an acceptable peace agreement. Because of Dien Bien Phu's strategic importance, it was chosen as the stage for this attack. The siege of Dien Bien Phu began on March 13, 1954. By this date the Viet Minh had approximately 50,000 regular troops, 55,000 support troops in the area. They also had around 100,000 transport workers in M∆∞·ªùng Thanh Valley area bringing in Chinese aid. The French garrison at Dien Bien Phu relied on air supply and on March 27 the Viet Minh had destroyed the French airfield. This left the French effectively cut off from the outside world. The Viet Minh had artillery posts and troops set up throughout the valley and were able to continuously assault the French. The French garrison in Dien Bien Phu surrendered on May 7.

Boswall wrote and produced the first wildlife film shown in colour on the BBC, The Private Life of the Kingfisher, filmed by Ron Eastman. It was broadcast in 1967 on BBC2. He was one of the \\"pioneers of British natural history broadcasting\\" (Daily Telegraph obituary, 5 September 2012).  Early years  Jeffery Hugh Richard Boswall was born in Brighton on 20 March 1931. A keen amateur ornithologist, his first published article appeared in the journal British Birds when he was 16. His interest in ornithology arose from a chance suggestion by a friend that he join him bird watching at the River Adur near Shoreham-on-Sea. His first full-time job was as assistant to the Director of Watchers and Sanctuaries for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.  BBC Natural History Unit  Boswall began as a radio producer, upon joining the BBC Natural History Unit in 1957, producing series including Birds of the Air and The Naturalist. He started to work on television programmes in 1964. He produced the Look series (introduced by Peter Scott) from 1963 to 1969, which is the series which made Peter Scott a household name in Great Britain. Boswall wrote and produced the first wildlife film shown in colour on the BBC, The Private Life of the Kingfisher, filmed by Ron Eastman and narrated by Peter Scott. It was broadcast in 1967 on BBC2. It won the Silver Medal at the Moscow Film Festival in 1967. It enormous popularity led to it being repeated an unprecedented eight times, as well as to Boswall commissioning a series of 18 programmes on single species in a series known as Private Lives, ranging from the Jackass Penguin to the Siamese Fighting Fish to the Cuckoo. He produced and presented Wildlife Safari to Ethiopia (1970), a six-part series. It was described by Christopher Parsons, former head of the BBC's Natural History Unit, as \\"arguably one of the best series of its genre ever made\\". Boswall went on to produce and present three follow up series: Wildlife Safari to the Argentine (1972), Boswall's Wildlife Safari to Mexico (1977) and Boswall's Wildlife Safari to Thailand (1979). He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Cherry Kearton Medal and Award in 1977. He wrote, produced and narrated Animal Olympians (1980) a one-hour special which compared the feats of animals to those of human olympians, as well as celebrating superlative feats from the natural world which have no human analogue. This was broadcast in connection with the Moscow Olympics in 1980 and was for many years in the top 5 sales of BBC programmes internationally. Other programmes he produced included Cracking the Egg (1982), The Truth behind the Turkey (1982), Natural World: Where the Parrots Speak Mandarin (1986) and Wild Waterfalls (1989) He was series producer for Birds For All Seasons, a three-part series broadcast in 1986, narrated by Magnus Magnusson. He wrote a book to accompany this series, with David Helton. He frequently appeared on or contributed to other radio and television programmes, including Today, Animal Magic, Nationwide, and Wogan.  Ethics of natural history broadcasting  Boswall is acknowledged as one of the key figures in shaping the approach to ethics in natural history broadcasting. He is credited with establishing two main commandments \\"Thou shalt not deceive the audience\\" and \\"thou shalt not harm nature\\". On the latter topic he was quoted in Discover magazine in 1985: > When I lecture about this issue, I ask this question: Who would shrink from > introducing a living fly into a spider's web to get a shot of the spider > feeding on the fly. Usually no one objects to that. Then I carry the same > question through the animal kingdom, up to using a monkey as a bait for a > boa constrictor. Not many people like that too much. Then I ask - supposing > of course that adequate provisions were made for his family - how would you > feel about feeding a human to a crocodile? Crocodiles do feed on humans, you > know, so it would be scientifically correct (original emphasis).  The profession of natural history broadcasting  Boswall chaired the first six BKSTS International Symposia for Wildlife Filmmakers from 1976 to 1991, being the main forum in the UK for wildlife filmmakers to meet and debate current issues in the profession. Keynote speakers included David Puttnam and Hugh Falkus. This event was merged with Wildscreen from 1994. In 1992 he became Senior Lecturer in Wildlife Film-making at the University of Derby, probably the first full-time position of its kind in the world. Boswall has taught courses in the UK and internationally on natural history film-making. He appeared on the jury at a number of international wildlife film festivals. Boswall's overall contribution to natural history broadcasting has been recognised by awards from the Royal Geographic Society and the British Kinematograph Sound and Television Society.  Wildlife sound recording  In addition to owning one of the largest privately held collections of commercially issued bird voice gramophone records and tapes, Boswall published numerous discographies including sound production by birds, mammals, insects and amphibians. He was joint author of The Peterson Field Guide to the Bird Songs of Britain and Europe and co-founder of the British Library of Wildlife Sounds collection now at the British Library Sound Archive in London.  Other work  After leaving the BBC in 1987 he became Head of Film and Video at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, producing a variety of programmes including Mud Matters (1988), Eagles - the Majestic Hunters (1990) and Flying for Gold (1992). Throughout his career he has given frequent public lectures on a variety of natural history topics, including bird song and tool using by birds. He has also led courses since 1988 aimed at those seeking to enter natural history television as a career on how to make wildlife documentaries. From the 1980s, Boswall was involved in the vanguard of the emerging trend towards eco-tourism, and has led wildlife tours to places as varied as the Gal√°pagos Islands, Ethiopia, Russia and China. Boswall wrote over 100 articles in scientific journals on natural history subjects. He wrote the annual update on global ornithology for Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Yearbook from 1964 to 1998.

It was named the Most Innovative Home Project of the Year by the U.S. Green Building Council, and has been featured on numerous green blogs, design magazines, The New York Times, National Public Radio, a documentary film, and an international television news report. It is the subject of a 10-year retrospective review in the upcoming Northeast Sustainable Energy Association annual meeting in March 2018. The goals of the team behind BrightBuilt Barn were two-fold: to demonstrate in a compelling project the principles of sustainable building that the team believed essential for future structures; and to bring together a critical mass of green designers and builders to help create an \\"ecosystem\\" of green building in Maine, modeled on the ecosystem of technology startups in Silicon Valley. Principles The principles guiding the BrightBuilt Barn project were: 1\\\\. Quality of Life/Livability - The BBB team felt strongly that many then-extant examples of sustainable buildings were ugly, inconvenient, and uncomfortable to live in. They believed that for sustainable building to be widely adopted, the resulting structures needed to be beautiful, comfortable, and convenient. A great deal of design energy went into making the Barn aesthetically pleasing, as a way to make green building attractive to a wider audience. 2\\\\. Sustainability - To be truly sustainable, a building must minimize waste, and minimize carbon footprint. To this end, the Barn used locally sourced materials, manufactured into pre-made panels offsite to be assembled onsite, and was designed to be completely powered by solar energy. In fact, the Barn was designed to produce enough excess electricity to eventually erase the carbon footprint created in building it. The energy requirement for heating the Barn was radically reduced by superinsulating the structure to R-40, approximately twice the insulation of conventional homes. The Barn's beauty and modularity made it more likely to be preserved by future owners, thereby avoiding the waste of rebuilding. 3\\\\. Replicability - The Barn was conceived as a model for next-stage green building, and as such needed to be replicable. This meant that it had to affordable, use widely available materials, and have a simple, replicable design. The designs, plans, and specifications of all components of the BrightBuilt Barn were released into the public domain, and were freely available online. 4\\\\. Disentanglement - Conventionally built houses have their various systems - electrical, heating/cooling, plumbing - entangled in crisscrossing lines, which complicates repair and replacement. Eventually, this encourages tearing down and rebuilding, which works against sustainability. The Barn separates all systems into chaseways, making repair and replacement straightforward. 5\\\\. Education - Since a major goal of the BrightBuilt Barn project was to encourage more sustainable building, education of both building professionals and the general public was an important part of the effort. A website was created that laid out the principles, showed photographs of the construction process and the finished building, and included all designs, plans, and specifications. Features 1\\\\. Superinsulation - By insulating the structure far beyond conventional norms, the energy demands for heating were radically reduced, allowing the structure to have no furnace, and still be warm in the fierce winters of Maine. 2\\\\. Solar powered - All energy for the Barn is produced by solar power. An array of photovoltaic solar panels on the south-facing roof creates electricity for lighting, the pump for the solar hot water system, and the backup heat pump. The solar panels create enough excess energy to power both the Barn and the conventional home that also sits on the property. Heat is produced by a roof- mounted solar hot water system, backed up by a high-efficiency heat pump. 3\\\\. LED lighting - The Barn was a pioneer in using LED lighting to radially reduce the energy demand and material waste associated with incandescent bulbs. 4\\\\. Grid tied - Although well designed to exist off the electrical grid is necessary or desired, the Barn is tied to the local electrical grid. It feeds electricity into the grid on sunny days, and draws electricity from the grid at night.

Description Zombie companies are indebted businesses that, although generating cash, after covering running costs, fixed costs (wages, rates, rent) they only have enough funds to service the interest on their loans, but not the debt itself. As such they generally depend on banks (creditors) for their continued existence, effectively putting them on never-ending life support.  History  The term \\"zombie company\\" was applied to Japanese firms supported by Japanese banks during the period known as the \\"Lost Decade\\" after the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in c.1990. Japanese banks continued to support weak or failing firms. The retailer Daiei is an example of a large company that expanded greatly during the period leading to the 1990 crash, and under different circumstances would have been expected to have entered receivership or bankruptcy. The finance minister Takeo Hiranuma was reported as describing the 96,000 employee firm as being 'too big to fail'. The term regained popularity in the media during 2008 for companies receiving bailouts from the U.S. Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). By 2016 following economic downturn in China (see also 2015‚Äì16 Chinese stock market crash), Chinese industrial companies (steel, aluminium, paper, etc.) had developed gross overproduction capacity problems, with overcapacity rising from 0% in 2007 to an average of 13% by 2015, with figures higher than 30% in some industries (cement, steel in 2014). At the 2016 National People's Congress the country's government recognised the issue of the 'Zombie Enterprises' and announced that it was to close or reorganise many state owned (public) industrial companies by 2020. In coal and steel industries resultant loss of work was expected to result in 1.8 million redundancies (15% of workforce), with total redundancies estimated to be up to 6 million workers. Zombie companies are those that remain in business but are so deeply in debt that they‚Äôll never catch up. In an age where U.S. monetary policy seems to ease by the day, enterprises of all sizes are tapping time and again into debt markets ‚Äî potentially creating a corporate landscape littered with zombie firms.

Professor Marc Edwards, an expert in plumbing corrosion, discovered lead levels at least 83 times higher than the accepted safe limit while performing research into premature pipe corrosion for the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (WASA). He found that the decision to change from chlorine to chloramine as a treatment chemical had caused the spike in lead levels. After the Washington Post ran a series of front-page articles about Edwards's findings, resulting in widespread public concern, the United States House of Representatives conducted an investigation. The House found that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had made \\"scientifically indefensible\\" claims in a report that had indicated there was no risk from the high lead levels. The Post investigation uncovered evidence of widespread misreporting of lead levels at water agencies across the United States, leading to regulatory crackdowns and changes in Environmental Protection Agency policies. The problem was addressed in 2004 by adding additional treatments to the water, preventing the chloramine from dissolving lead in the water mains, solder joints, and plumbing fixtures. In 2010, the CDC reported that 15,000 homes in the Washington, D.C., area might still have water supplies with dangerous levels of lead. 2001‚Äì04: Initial reports of elevated lead In 2001, more than half the water samples taken from 53 DC-area homes under the procedures required by the EPA's Lead and Copper Rule showed levels of lead exceeding the national standard of 15 parts per billion (ppb). Lead disrupts the physical and mental development of fetuses, babies, and young children, and can cause kidney problems and high blood pressure in adults. The rule does not assume that there is a \\"safe\\" level of exposure, but notes that 15 ppb is an \\"action level\\" where utilities must take action. The rule was created in 1991, after research showed that drinking water could account for one-fifth of all lead intake. Lead is not normally present in drinking water; it is released from the inside surface of lead service lines (pipes that run from the main to the house), joints connected with lead-based solder, and lead fixtures inside the house. Based on these findings, WASA was required to notify the public and implement plans to replace lead service lines in key areas of the municipal water system. The first media attention came in late 2002, when the Washington City Paper ran an article about a resident of American University Park whose water tested six to 18 times the EPA Lead and Copper Rule's action level. WASA found that homes in its service area with lead service lines averaged five times the EPA limit for lead during a year- long period. The results were unexpected; the EPA scientist overseeing DC's water suggested that drought conditions might have raised the alkalinity levels of the Potomac River, leading to a change in the pH of the water. As a result, WASA was required to start replacing seven percent of the district's lead service lines each year until the levels dropped below 0.015 milligrams per liter. At the time, about 23,000 WASA customers had lead service lines. In March 2003, Marc Edwards, a professor of civil engineering and expert on corrosion in drinking-water systems, was conducting research into an unexpected increase in pinhole leaks in copper water pipes in the DC area. WASA funded Edwards's research. Suspecting the leaks were caused by a change in the water chemistry, Edwards used a field meter to test for lead in one home's water. The meter could read values up to 140 ppb. His initial reading pegged the meter, so he diluted the sample to ten percent of its original strength. Even so, diluted, the sample still pegged the meter, indicating the water contained at least 1,250 ppb of lead. \\"Some of it would literally have to be classified as a hazardous waste,\\" Edwards said. After Seema Bhat, a water quality manager at WASA, told her superiors at the agency and at the EPA about the lead levels and warned that federal guidelines required aggressive action, she was fired by the agency. A federal investigator found that she had been improperly terminated. The lead levels required WASA to conduct a wider survey of their water quality. By the fall of 2003, it had tested more than 6,000 homes in the District, finding that two-thirds tested had more than 15 ppb of lead in their water. The survey showed that over 4,000 homes served by WASA had lead levels exceeding the acceptable level. More than a third of the homes surveyed‚Äî2,287 out of 6,118‚Äîhad levels exceeding 50 ppb. The water tested over 300 ppb in 157 homes. Despite this result, WASA did not notify its customers of the risk until November 2003. Although regulations required WASA to include the specific warning \\"Some homes in this community have elevated lead levels in their drinking water. Lead can pose a significant risk to your health.\\" in the water bills of each affected customer, WASA's notice omitted key parts of the phrase such as \\"in their drinking water\\" and \\"significant\\". Although Federal law required WASA to hold public meetings to discuss the problem and actions people could take to protect themselves, they advertised the meetings as being \\"to discuss and solicit public comments on WASA's Safe Drinking Water Act projects\\", omitting mention of lead. The EPA was required to review the notice before it was sent out; one D.C. Council member, commenting on the EPA's approval of the faulty notice, asked \\"Where were you, EPA?\\" The EPA later found that WASA's notice violated federal law because of the omissions. In January 2004, the Washington Post reported that the mayor and several D.C. Council members had not been informed of the elevated lead levels. The Washington City Paper said that Carol Schwartz, the councilmember who chaired the Committee on Public Works and the Environment, was not informed of the lead issue until that newspaper contacted her during the last week of January 2004. Early communications from WASA limited the health advisory to pregnant women and small children in homes with lead service leads, but later tests showed the high lead levels were also present in homes with copper service leads. Meanwhile, on January 2, 2004, WASA called Edwards and threatened to cut off his access to monitoring data needed for his research, and divert funding from him to other researchers, unless he stopped working with the homeowners whose water showed high lead levels. Soon after, the EPA discontinued its own contract with Edwards. 2004: Washington Post The issue became front-page news when the Washington Post ran an article titled \\"Water in D.C. Exceeds EPA Lead Limit\\" on January 31, 2004 across six columns of page A1. Reporter David Nakamura was contacted by one of the homeowners whose water was tested by WASA during its survey after he received the test results. Nakamura‚Äîwho had no prior experience with clean water issues‚Äîinitially thought it was a minor issue, but agreed to help the homeowner get a response from WASA. When WASA would not give him a straight answer, Nakamura pressed them for full data on the tests. Nakamura says that, even though he was \\"stunned\\" at the facts reported in that first story, the Post \\"had no idea about the size and scope of what was to follow.\\" The article quoted Erik Olson, an analyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council, as saying \\"This is a really big deal... If schools go over 20 parts per billion, they immediately take the water out of production.\\" WASA recommended that residents let the tap run for 30 seconds to one minute before using it to reduce the risk. This first Post article was the first public mention of the theory that the lead levels were tied to monochloramine. The traditional use of chlorine had been stopped four years earlier, out of concerns that it could produce harmful chemicals in the pipes. Long-term exposure to the byproducts from chlorine treatment has been linked with cancer. The paper quoted officials as saying that it was possible chloramine was more corrosive to lead pipes. (In fact, the Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for the Washington Aqueduct that supplies water to WASA, rejected a recommendation to add phosphates to the water to prevent lead leaching in the mid-1990s.) The change to chloramine was made after the EPA issued regulations concerning disinfection byproducts formed when chlorine reacts with organic matter in drinking water; the EPA considered these byproducts to be a potential health threat. After the first article, the Post formed a core team of reporters to investigate the issue. Nakamura was joined by reporters Carol Leonnig, Jo Becker, Avram Goldstein, and D'Vera Cohn; editor Marcia Slacum Greene provided daily oversight. Nakamura was the lead reporter for the breaking news coming from WASA and City Hall, and wrote profiles of key players. Leonnig reported on the federal and EPA response to the contamination. Cohn investigated the Washington Aqueduct angle and worked with water quality and environmental experts. Goldstein covered the DC Department of Health. Becker looked at water quality nationwide. After the first article appeared, residents inundated WASA's water hotline with calls and overwhelmed water testing laboratories with requests to have their tap water tested for lead contamination. District elected officials immediately called for an emergency public meeting, and established an inter-agency task force with the EPA to investigate and manage the problem. However, messages to the public at the time were often confusing and contradictory: while WASA was suggesting running taps for 90 seconds to flush out any lead, the EPA was demanding that recommendation be changed to ten minutes. The Post article lead WASA to hand out over 30,000 free water filters, hire health experts, and offer free blood tests to residents. Some water fountains were turned off due to lead levels. In 2004, the D.C. Council held 11 oversight hearings on the issue; the US Congress held four. American University claimed that its water was safe to drink, because the larger water mains feeding commercial sites like the college were not made of lead. After Nakamura's first few stories for the Post on the issue, he was contacted by Seema Bhat's attorney. Bhat, who was then fighting her dismissal from WASA, shared thousands of internal documents with Nakamura. The documents, Nakamura said, \\"provided a fairly clear picture\\" that WASA had been trying to find a way to avoid the cost of replacing pipes and adding additional chemicals to the water. He said Bhat's documents were critical to the Post's investigation. He recalls that, while reading the documents, the team found WASA memos indicating that they tried to find \\"clean\\" houses to test to reduce the apparent average lead level from the testing, but the more they tested, the more \\"dirty\\" houses they found. By April 2004, there were reports of some DC- area homes reaching lead levels of 6,000 ppb to 48,000 ppb. In June 2004, the EPA cited WASA for a \\"serious breach\\" of the law, including withholding six test results showing high lead levels in 2001, dropping half of the homes that had previously tested high for lead levels in subsequent testing, and avoiding homes known to be at high risk for contamination. In July, a WASA-commissioned report supported the Post's claims that the agency had known about the high lead levels for years, but had failed to notify regulators or the public. A DC WASA lead service line being replaced in 2008. In August 2004, the Army Corps of Engineers started adding orthophosphate to the water in hopes of preventing lead leeching. By November, WASA's board of directors had committed to a plan that would replace all of the agency's 23,000 lead pipes by 2010, at a cost of $300 million‚Äîstarting with 2,800 lead pipes to be replaced in 2005. WASA estimated that the repairs would cost residents $6 to $7 a month. The agency was not legally responsible for the portion of the lead service lines within a homeowner's property lines; however, they offered to perform the work at a set rate, and arranged a low-interest loan program with Wachovia Bank to help homeowners afford the cost. By January 31, 2005, the Post had run over 200 stories on the issue, amassing thousands of pages of correspondence through the Freedom of Information Act. Gloria Borland, a District resident, testified before Congress: \\"If the [Washington] Post had not exposed this scandal, our children today would still be drinking lead contaminated water\\". Post reporters Nakamura, Leonnig, Cohn, Becker, Craig Timberg, Monte Reel, and Sarah Cohen won the 2005 Selden Ring Award for Investigative Reporting for the articles. Michael Parks, director of USC Annenberg's School of Journalism and Pulitzer Prize-winning former editor of the Los Angeles Times, said \\"The Washington Posts work was a very important piece of journalism‚Äîimportant to every man, woman and child living in the District of Columbia, drinking its water and thinking it was pure. And it was important to the residents of other cities whose water is contaminated by lead and other toxic substances\\". The award's cash prize of $35,000 is believed to be the largest in journalism. According to Nakamura, some at the Post were surprised to win the award, because of the atypical nature of the Post's investigation. Most winners conduct a long-term investigation and then publish long articles over a few days with the results; the Post covered the investigation as a series of beat stories. Nakamura said he had never heard of the Selden Ring Award until the day his editor told him that the team had won it. 2004: The CDC report On March 30, 2004, an \\"MMWR dispatch\\", Blood Lead Levels in Residents of Homes with Elevated Lead in Tap Water --- District of Columbia, 2004, was made available on the MMWR web site. It was then published by CDC as \\"MMWR Weekly, April 2, 2004 / 53(12);268-270\\".\\"Blood Lead Levels in Residents of Homes with Elevated Lead in Tap Water --- District of Columbia, 2004\\" (MMWR, April 2, 2004) The report \\"summarizes the results of the preliminary investigations, which indicated that the elevated water lead levels might have contributed to a small increase in blood lead levels (BLLs)\\". The report describes the background, and the various kinds of blood tests it employed, and explicitly states: \\"All blood tests were used in this analysis.\\" There is no mention at all of any test results not being available, not even in the caveat section, where other potential sources of error are discussed. The report concludes that the high amounts of lead in the drinking water may have led to a slight rise of the blood levels; however, not to the levels of official concern. It also claims that the average levels were sinking. However, the report notes that there is no known \\"risk free\\" level, and therefore recommends that efforts should be made to eliminate lead in children's blood entirely. The report later was strongly criticized, both by Marc Edwards and by the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology; see . 2004‚Äì05: Government hearings At an oversight hearing before the House Committee on Government Reform in early March 2004, Marc Edwards testified that his studies showed the change from chlorine to chloramine was the cause of the elevated lead levels. He stated that the chloramine-treated water was leaching lead not only from the old lead lines, but also from brass fixtures in homes. Brass is made with lead; even brass classified as \\"lead free\\" under the Safe Drinking Water Act can contain up to eight percent lead. Edwards said that this could be the cause of the high lead levels in areas where WASA did not use lead lines. He also cautioned that replacing lead service lines with copper could make the problem worse; newly installed copper lines could react with the chloramine in a way that would increase corrosion of the remaining lead lines in the system. The chief of the Washington Aqueduct disagreed, saying that tests taken after the chloramine treatment commenced didn't show any additional corrosiveness. He believed corrosion inhibitors, like orthophosphate, could be added to the water to prevent lead leaching. In the spring of 2004, a temporary switch from chloramine back to chlorine for annual pipe flushing caused a 25 to 30 percent drop in lead levels, lending credence to the chloramine theory. In one home that was tested by WASA before and after the switch, lead levels dropped tenfold. On March 23, 2004, Anthony A. Williams (the mayor of the District of Columbia) and Carol Schwartz (chair of the DC Council's Committee on Public Works and the Environment) wrote a letter to President George W. Bush, asking the federal government to reimburse WASA $24,093,700 and the District of Columbia $1,730,401 to cover expenses from the lead contamination. The letter justified the request for full reimbursement by saying \\"the regulatory decisions of EPA appear to have generated these costs\\" and that it would be \\"inherently unfair\\" for taxpayers and WASA customers to pay those costs. In 2005, President Bush proposed cutting the EPA's budget by almost a half-billion dollars, mostly from clean-water programs. He wanted to decrease spending on replacing aging water facilities by 83 percent. On March 30, 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) that found the lead \\"might have contributed a small increase in blood lead levels.\\" The report claimed that no children with dangerously high blood lead levels were found, even in the homes with the worst lead levels. Officials in other cities, such as New York City and Seattle, cited the report as justification for a less-than-aggressive response to high lead levels in their own water. Water testing in the first six months of 2004 showed 90 percent of homes having 63 ppb of lead or less in the water. In October 2004, Edwards co-authored an article in the Journal of the American Water Works Association that linked chloramine use with greatly increased lead leaching. A report commissioned by the D.C. Council released on December 8, 2004 faulted the federal government's regulation of the city's water supply as a factor in the lead contamination. The report noted that no one agency was responsible for the water quality: The Army Corps of Engineers treated the water, WASA delivered it, and the EPA performed the quality checks. It urged the Council to assume authority for the entire system. In the last six months of 2004, 90 percent of homes tested had lead levels of 59 ppb or lower. The city's interim inspector general, Austin A. Andersen, released a report on WASA's performance in January 2005. Andersen called for WASA to enter a formal agreement with the city's Health Department to ensure that future communications about water health issues were timely and worded appropriately. WASA rejected the need for such an agreement. That same month, the Architect of the Capitol issued a warning to Capitol Hill employees that they should not use water from bathroom or kitchen faucets for drinking or cooking. Some water fountains on the campus were turned off, although employees were told it was okay to continue using the others. One home on Capitol Hill was found to have 308 ppb of lead in 2003. On January 21, 2005, the EPA ordered WASA to notify more than 400 homeowners that the agency had mistakenly told them their house's water lead levels were safe, and to replace an additional 500 service lines to comply with federal law. The EPA said that WASA had flushed the water line for five minutes before running the lead tests for those homes, resulting in artificially low readings; such a lengthy flush is not permitted by EPA standards. The EPA did not believe that the flushes were done intentionally by WASA to reduce lead levels. The testing had been done as part of an effort to avoid the expense of replacing lead lines in areas where it found low lead levels. 2004: Other cities investigated In 1999, an EPA survey estimated that the United States's drinking-water systems were in need of $150 billion worth of repairs over the following 20 years. However, in April 2004, an EPA spokesperson told the Washington Times that \\"high lead levels are not a pervasive problem\\". At a Congressional hearing that month, the EPA testified that it had no current information on lead levels in 78 percent of the nation's water systems, and that as many as 20 states had not provided any data. On October 5, 2004, the Washington Post ran a front-page article reporting that cities across the United States were illegally manipulating lead testing results, such as discarding high readings or avoiding homes likely to have high readings. A former EPA official described it as \\"widespread fraud and manipulation\\" on the part of water utilities. That July, however, an EPA administrator told Congress that \\"we have not identified a systemic problem\\". Using data from the EPA, the Post identified 274 utilities that had reported unsafe lead levels between 2000 and 2004. Some utilities defended their testing practices as being approved by state regulators; others argued that the lead was actually leaching from customers' fixtures, not their plumbing. Among the cities that the Post faulted through the EPA data were: * Boston, where state regulators discovered that at least one quarter of the locations tested were not at high risk for lead contamination; * Detroit, where the utility failed to test required high- risk homes; * New York City, which reported lead falling to safe levels in 2000‚Äîbut omitted 300 test results that would have marked the water as unsafe in 2001 and 2002 if reported; * Philadelphia, which could not produce documentation for their decision to discard a high test result from 2002‚Äîdespite being required by federal law to do so‚Äîthat would have put the city over the EPA limit if it had been included; * Lansing, Michigan, which discarded four tests that would have put the city's water over the limit because the homeowners supposedly did not follow the proper directions in collecting the samples‚Äîeven though the law prohibits doing so; * Ridgewood, New Jersey, which removed \\"hot\\" houses from its testing after exceeding the safe limit in 2000; * Providence, Rhode Island, where high levels were found in 2002, failed to inform the public as required and instead waited more than the legal limit of four months to test again; * Seattle, where state regulators allowed the utility to miss a 1997 deadline to reduce the corrosiveness of its water by six years, allowing high lead levels to persist during that period; * Portland, Oregon, where the city and state decided to launch a lead-danger educational campaign instead of building a treatment plant as required by law‚Äîand the EPA later suggested the utility drop urban homes with high lead levels from its testing and replace them with suburban homes with significantly lower levels. The Post article led the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York to open an investigation into the city's drinking-water lead levels. Regulators in Michigan and Oregon also investigated utilities singled out by the Post in those states. Senators James M. Jeffords and Paul S. Sarbanes called for the EPA to impose tougher standards; Jeffords and Senator Hillary Clinton called for an investigation of the EPA following the Post's findings. Seattle had already suffered widespread lead contamination in its public school system in 2003. One parent, a scientist who had initiated the investigation there, said \\"we continue to suffer from an epidemic of lead complacency\\" nationwide. The EPA said that between 2003 and 2005, only four large water systems had unsafe lead levels: Washington, DC; St. Paul, Minnesota; Port St. Lucie, Florida; and Ridgewood, New Jersey. 2005‚Äì06: Lower lead levels By January 2005, a year after the high lead levels were publicized by the Post, advocates were calling for the firing of local and federal officials involved in the issue, saying that they had done too little to fix the problem. Eric Olsen of the Natural Resources Defense Council said that officials \\"have fallen down on the job\\" because thousands of residents still had unsafe water. The group Lead Emergency Action for the District called for an overhaul of WASA's management, an independent study of needed improvements to the water system, stronger laws, and action from the EPA. \\"We want fines and a criminal review,\\" said Olsen. In March 2005, the EPA proposed changes strengthening the Lead and Copper Rule. The changes require utilities to give test results directly to homeowners, and to notify state and federal regulators before changing water-treatment methods. Critics, such as Clean Water Action, called the changes \\"revisions at the margins\\". Rick Maas, co-director of the Environmental Quality Institute at the University of North Carolina, said the revisions would \\"solve maybe 5 to 10 percent of the problem\\" with the Rule. Trade organizations, such as the American Water Works Association, found the changes \\"basically reasonable\\". That month, WASA said that recent tests showed encouraging declines in lead levels, which it attributed to the orthophosphate treatments started in August 2004. Out of 51 homes tested, only four had readings above 15 ppb; ten of those homes were above the 15-ppb standard the previous year, but fell below it in this test. WASA also noted that the Army Corps of Engineers would continue using chloramine throughout the year to keep the water chemistry stable. By May 10, 2005, the company was announcing that its tests were \\"below the '90th percentile lead action level.'\\" As of January 2006, WASA said that about 29 percent of its customers had chosen to replace the lead service lines within the customer's property. In a January press release, WASA said that the average lead level in its most recent tests was 7 ppb. The authority also claimed that a voluntary blood-lead-level screening it funded showed no identifiable public health impact from the elevated lead levels. The EPA formally reduced its oversight of WASA in May 2006, after testing showed the lead levels had remained below 15 ppb for a full year. However, the agency continued to require WASA to submit 100 samples every six months for at least another year; the normal requirement is 50 samples a year. Even after the lead levels abated, the Post continued to note other problems with the District's water supply. In 2007, it noted that WASA's periodic \\"chlorine surge\\" resulted in high levels of haloacetic acids, a chlorine disinfection byproduct believed to be unsafe. Utilities use annual or biannual chlorine surges to remove pathogens such as cryptosporidium that are not adequately killed by chloramine. Officials from the Washington Aqueduct and WASA said the levels were probably temporary and that the water was safe to drink. 2006‚Äì10: EPA, CDC, and other expert reports faulted In January 2006, the Government Accountability Office released a study criticizing the EPA's efforts monitoring lead levels in drinking water across the United States.Nakamura, David (January 26, 2006). \\"EPA Lax In Collecting Water Data, Study Finds\\". The Washington Post. Washington, DC. Retrieved June 22, 2011. Although the study found that lead in drinking water had generally declined since the 1990s, it noted that data collection problems \\"may be undermining the intended level of public health protection\\". There have been studies that show that there is no safe level for lead consumption. In their 2010 water quality report, DC Water stated that there was lead found in some water samples taken during monitoring. The possible causes linked to the lead contamination was said to be \\"corrosion of household plumbing systems; erosion of natural deposits.\\" The report did not state where the lead was found or who it impacted. Guidotti paper In 2007, the journal Environmental Health Perspectives published a paper about the public health response to the lead contamination, written by a team of academic investigators headed by Tee Guidotti of George Washington University. Guidotti and his team had been hired as consultants by WASA in 2004; he had told the WASA board that water only accounts for seven percent of the typical two-year-old child's lead exposure. The paper analyzed data from the 2004 screening program, identifying sources of confounding or bias. Four indicators were examined, and none showed evidence that blood lead levels had been affected by the elevation of lead in drinking water. The investigators concluded that the evidence did not clearly demonstrate a correlation between lead in the District's drinking water and blood lead levels. However, they cautioned that a population study was not suitable for establishing such relationships. They called for reduction in exposure from water as well as from other sources. The paper stated \\"There appears to have been no identifiable public health impact from the elevation of lead in drinking water in Washington DC in 2003 and 2004.\\" The Guidotti paper was called into question by members of the DC Council in February 2009, after the Washington Post ran an article about a more recent study by Marc Edwards that found a correlation between water and blood lead levels in area children. The National Institutes of Health, publisher of the journal in which the paper appeared, were unaware that George Washington University's contract with WASA gave the water authority final approval over anything Guidotti wrote concerning the authority. Guidotti was also supposed to remove the sentence about public health impact from the paper before publication, because experts reviewing the paper had rejected that finding; he failed to do so. Guidotti and WASA both denied that the agency influenced the paper; Guidotti said he didn't view the contract as giving WASA preapproval over the paper, and therefore didn't disclose it to the journal. In an August 2006 e-mail obtained by the Post from Edwards, Guidotti agreed to replace the sentence with \\"Measures to protect residents from exposure to lead in drinking water may have prevented more frequent elevations in blood lead\\" before its publication, but that did not happen. The journal refuses to accept research that is under a sponsor's control; it conducted a review to determine if the paper should be retracted‚Äîthe journal's first such review in its 30-year history. The paper had been cited as evidence that the lead contamination had not harmed District residents. In an e-mail to the Washington City Paper, Guidotti refuted any claims that WASA influenced the team's findings. He clarified that WASA's contract was with the university, not Guidotti personally. He said \\"The data in our 2007 study are valid, the analysis was accurately reported, and we stand by the conclusions.\\" The review panel convened by Environmental Health Perspectives released its findings in June 2009, finding that the controversial sentence was included due to \\"inattention to detail\\" and found no evidence that Guidotti was trying to mislead readers. The panel recommended that Guidotti submit an apology and correction; he did so. The panel said it found evidence that neither Guidotti nor WASA intended for the utility to exercise approval over the research conclusions. Edwards paper The March 1, 2009 issue of Environmental Science and Technology included a paper by Marc Edwards, Simoni Triantafyllidou, and Dana Best that established a link between the elevated lead levels in the drinking water and potentially harmful blood lead levels in area children. The Washington Post announced the results of that study on January 27, 2009. The report found that 42,000 children who were in the womb or under age 2 during the contamination are at risk of health and behavioral problems. In some areas, the number of children with enough lead to cause irreversible IQ loss and developmental delays more than doubled between 2000 and 2003. These findings contradicted previous statements by WASA that there were no health impacts, as well as the 2004 CDC MMWR report. David Bellinger, a Harvard University neurologist, told the Post, \\"If these data were available previously, I would be surprised that anyone would be assuring the public there was no problem.\\" The CDC refused to provide Edwards with the data necessary to perform the study. He convinced the Children's National Medical Center to share the data with him in 2008. The paper won the Editor's Choice Award for Best Science Paper of 2009 from the editors of Environmental Science and Technology. Congressional review of the 2004 CDC paper Edwards's study raised new questions about the March 2004 CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report that downplayed the health impact of the lead contamination. Salon noted that the CDC had found a link between lead pipes and high childhood blood lead levels in the district in 2007, but did not publicize the study. The principal author of the 2004 study‚ÄîMary Jean Brown, who co-authored the 2007 study‚Äîacknowledged that thousands of blood tests were missing from the 2004 study, but defended the paper's conclusion that any harm was slight. \\"There is no indication that DC residents have blood lead levels above the CDC levels of concern\\", she wrote. However, Edwards's results came from analysis of the same data used for the 2004 CDC report. When he wrote to the CDC's associate director of science, questioning the report's conclusions and methodology, he received a belated reply: \\"We have examined CDC's role in the study and have found no evidence of misconduct.\\" The United States House of Representatives' Science and Technology Committee opened a congressional investigation into the 2004 CDC report. Investigators found that although the CDC and city health department reported dangerous lead levels in 193 children in 2003, the actual number was 486 according to records taken directly from the testing laboratories. Representative Brad Miller of North Carolina called the CDC report's data \\"wildly incomplete\\". The underreported results came from the city's health department, which had said the missing tests were omitted because some labs did not report low lead levels to the city. The health department data was also the basis for Guidotti's paper. The investigation found that the CDC knowingly used flawed data in drafting the report, leading to \\"scientifically indefensible\\" claims in the 2004 paper. It also cited the CDC for failing to publicize later research showing that the harm was more serious than the 2004 report suggested. After the investigation's findings were released, the CDC initially stood by the report's findings that no significant harm was caused by the lead, but acknowledged that the claim that no children with lead poisoning had been found was \\"misleading\\". Edwards called for the CDC to retract the paper and for Brown's resignation. \\"If you were a child living in D.C. at that time, a single glass of tap water could have elevated your blood lead to unsafe levels,\\" said Edwards. The report strongly criticized Brown for failing to check the original lab results. It also noted that one section of the 2004 CDC report said not one of the people living in a home with water lead levels 20 times higher than the action level had elevated blood lead, but it failed to mention that most of those people were drinking bottled or filtered water, not tap water, before their blood was tested‚Äîa fact Brown and her co-authors were well aware of. The investigation found that Brown gave her fellow authors just three hours to review her work before it was submitted for publication. A year after the Washington Post published the results of the investigation, the CDC published a \\"Notice to Readers\\" in the May 21, 2010 issue of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report admitting that the 2004 report was misleading. It said the original report \\"did not reflect findings of concern from the separate longitudinal study that showed that children living in homes serviced by a lead water pipe were more than twice as likely as other DC children to have had a blood lead level ‚â•10 ¬µg/dL.\\" A further Notice to Readers published in June 2010 clarified that the results in the 2004 report \\"should not be used to make conclusions about the contribution of water lead to blood levels in DC, to predict what might occur in other situations where lead levels in drinking water are high, or to determine safe levels of lead in drinking water.\\" The Post described the CDC's Notice to Readers as \\"a full vindication\\" for Edwards, who spent tens of thousands of dollars out of his own pocket to fund his research, and who was the target of attempts to besmirch his professional reputation by the CDC and EPA. Tom Sinks, the deputy director of the CDC's national center for environmental health, told the Post \\"Looking backward six years, it's clear that this report could have been written a little better\\". In 2010, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UAS) claimed that the CDC Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning had been expected to lower the action level for lead in drinking water below 10 micrograms per deciliter in the summer of 2002. According to the UAS, Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, took the unprecedented step of rejecting a number of nominees to the committee selected by staff scientists. Instead, the group claims, Thompson appointed at least two appointees with financial ties to the lead industry. A 2010 Washington Post editorial cited the group's statement as a reason why the District's lead contamination \\"was practically inevitable\\" due to politicization of the CDC. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Delegate to Congress representing the District, accused the CDC of a coverup. Jim Graham, a member of the DC Council, said \\"To now learn that the Centers for Disease Control not only got it wrong but may have intentionally misled District residents and our water agency is the ultimate betrayal of the public trust\\". Lead service replacement continued through the 2000s (decade), but may not have helped the problem. A 2010 study by Brown at the CDC essentially confirmed Edwards's findings. It also found that the 15,000 \\"partial pipe replacements\\" performed by WASA‚Äîwhere lead service lines were replaced up to a homeowner's property line, but no further‚Äîmay not have effectively reduced lead levels, and may have made the problem worse. WASA spent $97 million to replace 17,000 pipes, including the 15,000 partial replacements. A Post article about the report lead to jammed phone lines at WASA and increased demand for bottled-water delivery. The study indicated that there is no safe level of lead in drinking water, and that children in homes with even a partial lead service line are at a much higher risk of lead poisoning than those with no lead in the line. WASA said the finding \\"is not news\\" to them; General Manager George Hawkins told WAMU that the utility had been acting as if the CDC's findings were fact for some time before the report was released. Hawkins said that WAMU was not seeing elevated levels of lead in homes with partial pipe replacements. John Parkhurst, et al. lawsuit On February 17, 2009, John Parkhurst, the father of twin boys living on Capitol Hill, through his attorneys Stefanie Roemer and David Sanford of Sanford, Wittels & Heisler, filed a class action lawsuit against WASA in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, seeking $200 million in compensatory damages plus punitive damages. Parkhurst, a 50-year-old single father and psychologist, prepared food and formula for the boys using tap water from the time they were 8 months old until 2002, when they were two years old. The complaint was later amended to add additional five children, on behalf of a proposed class consisting of all children who, at any time from 2000 to 2004, while six years of age or younger, consumed water supplied by WASA that passed through a line containing lead (whether directly or prenatally through their birth mothers), and who had blood-lead levels of 10Œºg/dl or higher. The suit claims that WASA \\"undertook Herculean efforts to shield itself from liability and to otherwise deny responsibility\\". Contemporary news reports indicated that WASA had not seen the lawsuit at the time the story broke, but included comments from WASA spokespeople that more studies would be needed before lead in drinking water could be linked to health and behavioral issues. The agency said that such claims would need to be substantiated on a case-by-case basis. WASA's motion to dismiss the complaint was denied in October 2009. In 2012 the named plaintiffs on the case sought to make the case a class action, but on April 8, 2013, judge Anthony C. Epstein denied their motion for class certification stating that the \\"class of tap water drinkers under 7 years old with elevated blood lead levels was too broad\\", and that it was not clear the class had or even possibly would suffer any injury. After Flint In 2016, in congressional testimony, Marc Edwards estimated that the Washington, D.C. crisis was \\"20 to 30 times worse\\" than the Flint water crisis. The Washington Post noted that the problem of lead in Washington, DC's drinking water is decades old. Within this new outlet, there are several articles that use incriminating and extreme headlines to grab the readers attention about the DC Water system. Many media outlets have compared the Flint Water Crisis to the decades old water issue in Washington, DC because both problems pertain to lead in drinking water. 2017‚Äì18 In 2017, the DC Water Quality Report, Washington DC was found to be in compliance with the EPA's standards for lead within drinking water. However, there is no safe level of lead for children to consume. According to the EPA, lead at any level can be harmful. The EPA has a maximum contamination goal of zero; however, they have not stated how or when they are going to enforce the regulation if it is amended. During the summer of 2018, Washington DC issued a boil water advisory to all of its residents in the North East and North West areas. This was done as a precaution to citizens since the water did test positive for many different harmful contaminants in the tested areas. In 2018, DC Water's Drinking Water Quality Report states that there is infrastructure in Washington, DC that contains lead that may impact the drinking water in certain areas. Tips for how to prevent contamination are provided on the report. All the lead pipes in Washington, DC have not been replaced and those that remain may cause problems for those consuming the water. DC Water created an interactive map to show its residents which pipe lines are made out of lead or other dangerous metals. The information was gathered from historical data and inspections. An article published in 2018 by CNN states that the EPA gave the Virginia Tech researcher that found the lead within Flint, MI's and Washington, DC's water supplies a grant to search other major cities. The grant consists of $1.9 million dollars and will be used to help people where there is a suspicion of lead being in their drinking water but government officials aren't acting on it. This project is said to target Michigan and Louisiana initially then it will branch out to other areas.

It was established in 1876 in celebration of the United States Centennial. Prior to establishment of the park, it was the site of the Marine Telegraph Station. The main feature of the park, Coit Tower, was completed in 1933 using a $118,000 bequest left to the city by Lillie Hitchcock Coit in 1929. A bronze statue of Christopher Columbus was placed in the park in 1957, and removed in June, 2020.  History  After a storm destroyed the Marine Telegraph Station at the top of Telegraph Hill in 1876, George Hearst purchased the property and donated it to the city under the stipulation that the land be dubbed \\"Pioneer Park.\\" Later purchases by the city substantially added to the park's size. To engage the public, an observatory and bar was built on the property in the style of a German castle. The venture was unsuccessful and ultimately closed after a fire in the early 1900s. In 1902, the North Beach Improvement Club, California Club, and California Art League together lobbied the city to preserve the land. The city responded by adding roads increasing public access. In 1924, Lillie Hitchcock Coit passed, leaving the city with $118,000. The money was ultimately used to construct Coit Tower, the primary feature of the park.

Since it spans an entire block it has addresses at 1100 E. Baltimore St. and 1107 E. Fayette St. \\"The Hendler Creamery is historically significant for its contribution to the broad patterns of history in three areas of significance: transportation, performing arts, and industry.\\" Varying usages Construction and architect The Hendler Creamery consists of two adjacent building complexes. The original three-story brick Richardsonian Romanesque building was constructed as a cable car powerhouse in 1892, replacing five old houses on the site in the Old Town / Jonestown neighborhood east of the downtown neighborhood and the dividing Jones Falls stream in East Baltimore. This use necessitated massive arched doors and a mezzanine floor. The construction is of red face brick with red mortar joints and Potomac red Seneca stone trim, and contains much architectural detailing. The front on East Baltimore Street includes four large contiguous Romanesque Revival half- round arched openings with four pairs of rectangular window openings directly above these. In reviewing plans for the building, the influential \\"The Sun\\" newspaper descriptively wrote at the time of February 1892, that \\"it would be one of the most prominent structures in that part of the city\\" and continued, \\"Economy, durability and simplicity are the controlling motives of the design, and a practical power-house, with a proper regard for architectural proportions and effect, without unnecessary ornamentation, is expected to be the result.\\" Additions for later owners including Hendler's Creamery for dairy products and their locally famous brand of ice cream, were built in 1915-20 and 1949. It is also connected to a one-story brick building built in the 1960s. The second building complex is a brick warehouse structure built from 1923 to 1927. The architect was Jackson C. Gott (1829-1909), a Baltimore-based architect who is survived by eight buildings currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places maintained by the United States Department of the Interior and its National Park Service. In the same year that the Jonestown cable-car powerhouse was built, Gott also designed in the northern area of the expanding city, the currently named Charles Theatre building on North Charles Street by East Lanvale Street (few blocks south of North Avenue, previously named Boundary Avenue as the old northern city limits from 1818 to 1888), also for the B.C.P.R.. It too served as a cable-car powerhouse, in this case for the BCPR's 2.2 mile Blue Line, which ran south to north, essentially along Charles Street, from South Street by East Pratt Street on the downtown harbor waterfront and financial district to 25th Street (then named Huntingdon Avenue) in the Peabody Heights (now renamed Charles Village) neighborhood, being recently developed by the 1870s on the north edge of the city. The structure later served for several purposes including a dance hall as the Famous Ballroom through the 20th century until presently renovated into a prominent multi-screen movie theater in the recently renamed Mid-Town Station North neighborhood. In the 1890s, Gott further designed two other well-known extant Baltimore buildings: the additional landmark with a dark gray granite stone central pyramidal tower and the west/south wings facing on Greenmount Avenue and Eager & Forrest Streets for the northern/eastern extensions of the old Maryland Penitentiary, founded 1806, previously facing on East Madison Street, (now renamed the Metropolitan Transition Center in the 2010s) in 1894, and the Southern District Police Station for the Baltimore City Police Department at 28 East Ostend Street (between South Charles and Light Streets) in the old South Baltimore / Federal Hill neighborhood in 1896. Cable-car powerhouse As a cable-car powerhouse for the Baltimore City Passenger Railway Company from 1892 to 1898, the building played an important role in Baltimore's transportation history as cable-car mass transit was first developed to replace the horse-car lines operating for half a century since the late 1850s. According to the Maryland Historical Trust, the building powered the run of cable from Gay Street to North Avenue, using two Reynolds compound non-condensing Corliss steam engines, 24\\" + 38\\" x 60\\". These propelled a sheave which pulled a continuous loop of cable and moved the car at a speed of around 11 miles per hour. Just like a subway line today, this line was designated by a color, the Red Line, and ran from East North Avenue, south down North Gay Street, curving around to the east on East Baltimore Street, and then on further east to Bank Street and Patterson Park in East Baltimore's developing Highlandtown neighborhood. The total mileage distance was 10.7. Electric powered cars with overhead lines began replacing cable cars on the Red Line on August 30, 1898 as a more economical and faster means of mass transit. Cables were removed immediately, but the expense of extracting the underground pulleys, sheaves and other steel/iron fittings was too much, and in most instances they were just covered over as streets were gradually repaired and resurfaced with bricks, cobblestones / Belgian blocks or later concrete / asphalt. With the switchover, The Baltimore City Passenger Railway Company was absorbed into Baltimore's merged trolley monopoly in the late 1890s with the formation of the United Railways and Electric Company (later the Baltimore Transit Company after a bankruptcy and reorganization in 1935, adding transit diesel powered buses to the extensive streetcar system), and power was generated at the newly constructed pile of the massive huge red brick Pratt Street Power Plant, situated on the waterfront at municipal Pier 4, facing the Northwest Branch of the Patapsco River and its \\"Basin\\" (later known as the Inner Harbor). UREC held onto the landmark industrial building with its electric generators connected to great furnaces and boilers for steam power with four parallel smokestacks and conveyor belt system for loading coal ore fuel from moored harbor barges connected to waterfront terminal facilities further south in the Baltimore Harbor of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Western Maryland Railway trains from the mines in the Appalachian Mountains to the West, for a few decades, using the rear half as a \\"trouble station\\" for trolleys and renting out the front to the U.S. Navy (Maryland) Naval Reserves for use as a drill-room. In all, the two later competing Baltimore cable-car companies (themselves a product of mid and late 19th century mergers and consolidations), the Baltimore Traction Company (BTC) and Baltimore City Passenger Railway (BCPR), built six powerhouses scattered through the city, three each. This was a very significant capital expense for an industrial enterprise that only lasted from 1891 to 1899. Of the three and a half surviving powerhouses, the later Hendler Creamery building on East Baltimore Street between East and Lloyd Streets is the only one listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As mentioned above, another Gott designed powerhouse survives today as the Charles Theatre (BCPR) building, while the third totally extant powerhouse (BTC) lies three blocks south at 1110 East Pratt Street by Central Avenue (formerly Canal Street and before that the Hartford Run stream). The latter was most recently used as the Pratt Street Garage of the Baltimore City Department of Public Works - Solid Waste Division. It is now boarded up and waiting some kind of adaptive re-use. It stretches a full block, between East Pratt and Granby Streets, and is surrounded by Albemarle Square, a 15 block rebuilt and revitalized area that replaced a 1950s era of the high-rise towers of the now dilapidated and crime ridden Flag House Courts public housing projects, with a new surrounding neighborhood of multi-priced townhouse residences renamed Albemarle Square, which resembled the previous 19th and early 20th centuries tightly packed blocks of brick rowhouses of the old original Old Town / Jonestown communities founded in the 1760s. While not having the architectural flair of Stanford White's nine-story Beaux-Arts Cable Building on lower Broadway in New York City, the Hendler Creamery is one of the absolute gems of the American cable powerhouses that have survived. For the most part these structures evidenced utilitarian, warehouse style construction, which can be seen clearly in the still extant LaSalle Street Cable Car Powerhouse in Chicago, Illinois. The only other architecturally significant Baltimore cable-car powerhouse, the former Baltimore Traction Company's Druid Hill Avenue powerhouse and car barn, south of Druid Hill Park in the northwest city, lost half of its structure in 2005 in a spectacular 5 - alarm blaze. It is a massive Victorian and Romanesque-style red brick-and-stone trim structure. The Epworth Powerhouse (BTC) on Mosher Street in West Baltimore had been torn down years before (see drawing below in gallery). It is a lesson in a site's metamorphoses: going from a church to a powerhouse to a dry cleaning plant, and finally, after demolition, to a high-rise apartment building standing today. The last powerhouse (BCPR) on South Eutaw Street, south of West Baltimore Street, succumbed long ago to the pressures of razing and urban redevelopment. Yiddish theatre After the replacement of the cable car by electric trolleys, the Hendler Creamery was then converted into a performance space by Baltimore-born James Lawrence Kernan (1838-1912). He was a theater manager, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, who earlier in his life had fought for the Confederates, been captured and held as a prisoner till the war's end at the brutal Point Lookout Prisoner-of-War Camp at the confluence of the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River. Returning to civilian life, among other ventures, he started a combination hotel and German Rathskeller and founded a hospital, which survives today as the University of Maryland Rehabilitation & Orthopaedic Institute. Under Kernan's ownership, a second floor, containing an auditorium and dressing rooms, was installed above the first-floor engine room. He named it the Convention Hall Theater. It operated primarily as a Yiddish theater from 1903 to 1912, serving the largely Jewish immigrant population. Some of the city's earliest motion pictures were also shown here by Kernan. Yiddish theater was first performed in Baltimore in the mid-1880s at Concordia Hall, an aristocratic club of Baltimore German Jews. It burnt down in 1891. The building's conversion to a theater links it to Baltimore's early-20th century performing arts history, which includes melodrama, movies, opera, vaudeville, as well as the Yiddish theater. Hendler Ice Cream Company The building's most important and longest historical legacy came when it was purchased by the Hendler Ice Cream Company in 1912 for $40,000 and converted to the country's first fully automated ice cream factory. Besides producing one of Baltimore's favorite brands of ice cream, it played a major role in the development of the nation's ice cream business. Many important pioneering industry innovations were developed over the next 50 years in this building, including new kinds of packaging; the blade sharpener, which produced smoother ice cream; and fast freezing, which allowed ice cream to be frozen with a liquid cream texture. The adjoining building at 1107 East Fayette Street, built in the 1920s as part of the Hendler Creamery complex, is also significant, notably in the creation of one of the nation's first ice cream delivery systems by refrigerated truck. As the Maryland Historical Society noted in a blog posting, The Velvet Kind: The Sweet Story of Hendlers Creamery, \\"The ice cream was virtually everywhere in Maryland, as it was distributed to over 400 stores at the company‚Äôs peak, which kept the production lines humming. The factory ran six days a week with vanilla ice cream being made almost everyday. Vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry were production mainstays, but the creamery dabbled in more exotic flavors as well. Hutzler's department store sold several varieties, including ginger and peppermint. For the Southern Hotel, Hendlers supplied a tomato sorbet which was served as a side dish rather than dessert. The eggnog ice cream was produced each year at Christmas time. Hendler made with real rum, was a major hit. The factory also cranked out other holiday-themed products, such as an Independence Day treat made with vanilla, strawberry, and blueberry ice creams and a Mother‚Äôs Day cake topped with a silk screen of James McNeill Whistler‚Äôs portrait of his mother.\\" The creamery closed in the 1970s. The nearby Jewish Museum of Maryland has an extensive archive of Hendler Company and family memorabilia. Historic preservation designation The Hendler Creamery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Reuse Following a fourth incarnation as a warehouse and city social services agency, the Hendler Creamery buildings are, as of the spring of 2014, being planned for refurbishment. The Commercial Group, a Maryland-based real estate and construction company, bought the building in 2012 for $1.08 million, and is planning a $51 million adaptive re-use, featuring 276 units, along with up to 11,000 sq ft of retail. The project includes exclusive amenities such as multiple outdoor courtyards, a pool deck overlooking the Baltimore skyline, basketball courts, and a yoga studio. Kirby Fowler, president of Downtown Partnership of Baltimore Inc., said redevelopment of the Hendler building would be the next chapter in a decade-long revival for Jonestown. ‚ÄúWhen you think about what that area used to be like 12 years ago, we‚Äôve gone lightyears toward improvement,‚Äù Fowler said. ‚ÄúAlbermarle Square [about four blocks away] is this incredibly progressive mixed-income project that came as the result of some HUD money and federal support, and it‚Äôs really helped expand Little Italy and Fells Point further north. There‚Äôs already progress heading in that direction, and this just continues that.‚Äù Baltimore City officials have said that they view this location‚Äîtwo blocks east of the iconic Shot Tower, seven blocks west of the bustling campus of The Johns Hopkins Hospital and nine blocks north of the contemporary mixed-use development project Harbor East‚Äîas critical to attractively tying together the Hopkins medical facilities and Downtown Baltimore.

Some of these foundation dances are \\"two step,\\" \\"brookfield,\\" \\"auntie,\\" \\"shaking,\\" \\"the busta,\\" \\"cliffhangers,\\" \\"tsunamis\\" and \\"traces\\". Turf dance also includes \\"story telling\\" which is a style based on pantomime \\"life stories\\" or \\"everyday activities\\". Turfing incorporates other dance style concepts such as tutting, flexing, waving and animation. Turf dance is an improvisational, free-flowing form of dance that is based on the idea of pure cause and effect but focuses on storytelling, the creation of optical illusions, and the display of distinctive personal style. Dance elements include Boogaloo, popping, locking, and miming. Gliding is heavily used in turf dance because it enables the creation of optical illusions. \\"Going dumb,\\" or completely letting one's emotions loose on the dance floor, is also a distinctive part of the tradition.

It complements the information provided by caloric testing and other forms of inner ear (vestibular apparatus) testing. There are two different types of VEMPs. One is the oVEMP and another is the cVEMP. The oVEMP measures integrity of the utricule and superior vestibular nerve and the cVemp measures the saccule and the inferior vestibular nerve. Manzari, L., Burgess, A. M., & Curthoys, I. S. (2010). Dissociation between cVEMP and oVEMP responses: Different vestibular origins of each VEMP? European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, 267(9), 1487-1489. The vestibular system The vestibular system helps a person maintain: balance, visual fixation, posture, and lower muscular control. There are six receptor organs located in the inner ear: cochlea, utricle, saccule, and the lateral, anterior, and posterior semicircular canals. The cochlea is a sensory organ with the primary purpose to aid in hearing. The otolith organs (utricle and saccule) are sensors for detecting linear acceleration in their respective planes (utrical=horizontal plane (forward/backward; up/down); saccule=sagital plane (up/down)), and the three semicircular canals (anterior/superior, posterior, and horizontal) detect head rotation or angular acceleration in their respective planes of orientation (anterior/superior=pitch (nodding head), posterior=roll (moving head from one shoulder to other), and horizontal=yaw (shaking head left to right). Located within the membranous labyrinthine walls of the vestibular system are approximately 67,000 hair cells in total. This includes ~7,000 hair cells from each of the semicircular canals located within the crista ampullaris, ~30,000 hair cells from the utricle, and ~16,000 hair cells from the saccule. Each hair cell has about 70 stereocilia (short rod-like hair cells) and one kinocilium (long hair cell). History Bickford et al. (1964) Bickford RG, Jacobson JL, Cody DTR (1964). Nature of average evoked potentials to sound and other stimuli in man. Ann NY Acad Sci 112:204-218. and subsequently Townsend and Cody,Townsend GL, Cody DTR (1971). The averaged inion response evoked by acoustic stimulation: its relation to the saccule. Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol 80: 121-131. provided evidence for a short latency response in posterior neck muscles in response to loud clicks that appeared to be mediated by activation of the vestibular apparatus. These authors made the additional important observations that the response was generated from EMG (muscle) activity and that it scaled with the level of tonic activation. Subsequent work led to the suggestion that the saccule was the end organ excited. In 1992 Colebatch and Halmagyi Colebatch JG, Halmagyi GM(1992). Vestibular evoked potentials in human neck muscles before and after unilateral deafferation. Neurology 42: 1635-1636. reported a patient with a short latency response to loud clicks studied using a modified recording site (the sternocleidomastoid muscles: SCM) and which was abolished by selective vestibular nerve section. Colebatch et al. (1994) Colebatch JG, Halmagyi GM, Skuse NF (1994). Myogenic potentials generated by a click-evoked vestibulocollic reflex. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 57:190-197. described the basic properties of the response. These were: the response occurred ipsilateral to the ear stimulated, the click threshold was high, the response did not depend upon hearing (cochlear function) per se, it scaled in direct proportion to the level of tonic neck contraction, the response was small (although large compared to many evoked potentials) and required averaging, and only the initial positive-negative response (p13-n23 by latency) was actually vestibular-dependent. It was subsequently shown to be generated by a brief period of inhibition of motor unit discharge.Colebatch JG, Rothwell JC (2004). Motor unit excitability changes mediating vestibulocollic reflexes. Clin Neurophysiol 115(11):2567-2573. VsEPA and VSEPL VsEP assesses the non-auditory portions of the labyrinth and requires kinematic stimuli (i.e. motion) instead of sound stimuli and bear only a loose relationship to VEMPs. This kinematic stimuli needs to be well characterized, precisely controlled, consistent in amplitude, and consistent in kinematic makeup. An electromechanical shaker is a stimuli generator that is widely available. This shaker provides a transient stimuli, can generate angular or linear acceleration, and can couple to the skull directly (with skull screws) or via a stimulus platform. The VsEP is commonly divided into two sections: angular vestibular evoked potentials (VsEPA) and linear vestibular evoked potentials (VsEPL). VsEPA VsEPA stimuli needs to be a brief or transient, high amplitude, angular acceleration pulse. Currently, the most effective stimuli for the best results have not yet been identified or agreed upon by researchers. The major downfall of the VsEPA response is that it also elicits a VsEPL response. VsEPL In contrast to VsEPA, researchers have standardized the VsEPL stimuli but many variants of this standard are being used in research laboratories today. The stimulus needs to be a transient, rapidly changing pulse (i.e. linear jerk stimulus). A rectangular jerk step/pulse is generated by an electromechanical shaker. The main downfall of the VsEPL response is the presence of electrical artifacts due to movement and touching of the wires/electrodes during testing. Application of VEMPs An early application was in the diagnosis of superior canal dehiscence a condition in which there can be clinical symptoms and signs of vestibular activation by loud sounds. Such cases have a pathologically lowered threshold for the sound-evoked VEMP. The test is also of use in demonstrating successful treatment.Welgampola MS, Myrie OA, Minor LB, Carey JP (2008). Vestibular-evoked myogenic potential thresholds normalize on plugging superior canal dehiscence. Neurology 70:464-472. It has diagnostic applications in M√©ni√®re's disease, vestibular neuritis, otosclerosis as well as central disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Other methods of activating the vestibular apparatus have been developed, including taps to the head,Halmagyi GM, Yavor RA, Colebatch JG (1995). TApping the head activates the vestibular system: a new use for the clinical reflex hammer. Neurology 45(10); 1927-29. bone vibration Sheykholeslami K, Murofushi T, Kermany MH, Kaga K (2000).

Vestibulocollic reflexes evoked by short-duration galvanic stimulation in man. J Physiol 513(2):587-97. It is likely that both air-conducted and bone-conducted stimuli primarily excite irregularly discharging otolith afferents.Curthoys IS, Kim J, McPhedran SK, Camp AJ (2006). Bone conducted vibration selectively activates irregular primary otolithic vestibular neurons in the guinea pig. Exp Brain Res 175:256-267.

His spirit lives on in Snowden, a snowman, who wears Albert‚Äôs old hat and scarf. Kate knows that Lizzie will not be accepted if she doesn't know how to skate, so she pushes Lizzie onto the ice. Kate's bitter rival, Shana (Jos√©e Chouinard), and her students give Lizzie the cold shoulder and laugh at her when she falls. Lizzie comes off the ice in tears and Kate is reminded of when she fell down in one of her performances while attempting a difficult movement during her first competition for the Albert Trophy. Kate's fall allowed Shana to win the competition and all succeeding competitions except one that Bret (Kurt Browning) won only because Shana had a broken ankle and pneumonia. However, she still came in second place. This discouraged Kate, leading her to vow never to skate again.

She wins and is promptly given the trophy by Shana, who has become less hostile. Scootch (Scott Hamilton), the narrator, Zamboni man, and old friend of Albert's, carries Lizzie to Kate. At the end, Lizzie goes out on the ice in an attempt to skate, encouraged by her mother's earlier performance. She skates with Snowden for a while before he transforms back into Albert (Kurt Browning), who starts teaching Lizzie how to skate as he had done with Kate. She sees this and smiles.

The canal runs across the well-known aqueduct at H√•verud and is a much visited tourist attraction during the summer months, drawing yachts, motor boats as well as canoeists. Geography The canal system stretches from K√∂pmannebro on Lake V√§nern via the Dalsland lakes of R√•varpen, Laxsj√∂n, Lel√•ng and continues into southwestern V√§rmland by means of the lakes of Foxen, T√∂ck and finally reaches Lake √ñsten and its extension named Sn√§cke Canal. The lakes of Stora Le and both V√§stra Silen and √ñstra Silen are also deemed part of the canal system. A boat lift at Strandviken on Stora Le N√∂ssemark enables ships to be loaded onto lorries to Halden in Norway and continue their journey down Idefjord and Svinesund to Skagerak. Stora Le is situated 66 m (217 ft) above Lake V√§nern. Thirty-one locks help to span this drop. 17 metres of head space along the route enables sail boats to ply the entire length of the canal, in contrast to many other canals in Sweden. However, it pays to note that only 1.8 m (6 ft) of draught and a maximum length of 22.75 m and width of 4.05 m are allowed. Maximum speed on the canal is set at 2.5 knots. History The canal was dug between 1864 and 1868 by engineer Nils Ericson. Only 12 km (7.5 Mi) out of the 250 km stretch of the canal system had to be dug or dynamited, as Ericson made good use of the numerous lakes which span this area. Canal use The canal is exploited by the Dalslands Kanal AB company, seated in √Öm√•l. The canal dues are SEK50 per lock for small boats up to SEK2500 for the whole canal back and forth (in 2010). Several shipping companies offer short cruises on the canal. The Dalsland kanotmaraton + canoeing competition is partly held on lakes forming part of the canal system.

He was appointed as the first Dean of Winchester Cathedral at the foundation of the new chapter in 1541. Biography William Kingsmill was professed to the Rule of Saint Benedict at St. Swithun's Priory (Winchester Cathedral) in 1513.Joan Greatrex, ed. Biographical Register of the English Cathedral Priories of the Province of Canterbury, c. 1066‚Äì1540, (Oxford, U.K.: 1997) p. 671. Upon joining the Benedictine Monastery he took on the name of his home town Basyng and was known as William Basyng until 1540.John Le Neve, et al., Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1541‚Äì1857: Volume 3, Canterbury, Rochester and Winchester Dioceses, (London: 1974) p. 83. During his time as a monk, Basyng obtained several secular appointments. Bishop Foxe of Winchester ordained Basyng as a Deacon in 1521.G. W. Kitchen, ed. Compotus Rolls of the Obedientiaries of St. Swithun's Priory, Winchester, (London: 1892), p. 479. Two years later, Basyng was fully ordained as a priest. During his time as a monk, Basyng studied logic, philosophy and theology, and was granted the degree of Bachelor of Theology by University of Oxford on 1 June 1526.A. B. Emden, ed. A Biographical Register of the University of Oxford, A. D. 1501‚Äì1540 (Oxford, U.K.: 1974) p. 31. Over the next three years, Basyng participated in four public disputations on theology, and received his licence to preach in January 1529. His final disputation was presented on 4 February, and he received his Doctorate in Theology on 15 March 1529.C. W. Boase, ed. Register of the University of Oxford, Volume I: 1449‚Äì63 and 1505‚Äì71, (Oxford, U.K.: 1885) p. 132. Basyng became a leader within the priory due to his education and experience with the outside world as a secular cleric. In 1529, when Henry VIII summoned the Reformation Parliament, he also summoned a meeting of Bishops, Deans, Priors and leading monks and clergy to a Convocation of Canterbury. Basyng was summoned as a representative for St. Swithun's, along with his prior, Henry Broke.Letters & Papers, Foreign and Domestic of the Reign of Henry VIII (L&P;), 22 volumes in 37 (London, 1862‚Äì1932) Volume 4, Part 3, No. 6047. Basyng may not have attended, though Prior Broke seems to have been present. As a lesser clergyman, Basyng's selection to the Convocation singled him out for future promotion, such as then Archdeacons Stephen Gardiner and Thomas Cranmer.Stanford E. Lehmberg, The Reformation Parliament, 1529‚Äì1536, (Cambridge, U.K.: 1970) pp. 66‚Äì69. Over the next six years, Basing rose within the ranks of the Priory to the position of \\"Hordarius et Coquinarius\\" meaning in charge of the kitchens, and over the non-sacred property of the monastery.Kitchen, ed. Compotus Rolls, pp. 62, 489, 496; John Caley and Joseph Hunter, eds. Valor Ecclesiasticus, Temp. Henr. VIII. Auctoritate Regia Institutus, 5 volumes (London: 1810‚Äì1834), 2:2‚Äì3. When Henry VIII commissioned an evaluation of all the property held by the monastery in 1535, Basyng controlled the largest amount of wealth, second only to the Prior.Winifred A. Harwood, \\"The Impact of St. Swithiun's Priory on the City of Winchester in the Later Middle Ages\\", in Revolution and Consumption in Late Medieval England, edited by Michael Hicks (Woodbridge, U.K.: 2001) p. 167. Though Basyng was not the subprior, he was still controlled enough respect at the monastery, and enough political power outside St. Swithun's to be a viable candidate for the next prior. Prior Bloke had served as subprior for almost ten years before his election for prior in 1524. Broke had served with little to no complaint during his tenure, but with the legal and religious changes of the 1530s, his conservative position on church doctrine made him a target for reformers.Emden, ed. Directory of Oxford, 1540‚Äì1541, p. 72; G. R. Elton, England Under the Tudors, (London: 1955) p. 143-145; L&P;, Volume 4, Part 3, No. 6544. Sometime after the valuation of St. Swithun's, a scholar and monk named Richard Mylls brought Prior Broke to the attention of Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell was battling the Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner for political power in the diocese, while also trying to place proponents of the Royal Supremacy and further reforms against Catholic traditions, such as the removal of relics.Clayton J. Drees, Authority and Dissent in the English Church (Lewiston, N.Y.: 1997) pp. 120‚Äì121; Richard Rex, Henry VIII and the English Reformation, second edition (New York, NY: 2006) pp. 45‚Äì47. A monk named Richard Mylls sent a protest to Cromwell that Broke had forbade him to study at Oxford because Mylls had spoken out against the veneration of saints, pilgrimages, and the Rule of Saint Benedict.L&P;, Volume 9, No. 1129. Broke's conservative theological opinion, combined with rumours that Broke had stolen and sold jewels from the Priory in London, brought his term to a quick close. In March 1536, Broke resigned his position, as he felt he would have been deprived by Cromwell anyway.L&P;, Volume 10, Nos. 472, 480. Basyng sought nominations from Cromwell and local elites, going so far as to offer Cromwell ¬£500 in fees from the priory lands if elected.John Crook, ed. Winchester Cathedral: Nine Hundred Years, 1093‚Äì1993 (Guildford, U.K.: 1993) p. 159. Thomas Parry, a local elite, wrote Cromwell on Basyng's behalf, and stated that Basyng was \\"a man of learning and a favourer of the truth\\", meaning he was sympathetic to Cromwell's religious goals.L&P;, Volume 10, No. 480. The brothers of St. Swithun elected Basyng, and served a quite tenure for the next few years. By 1538, Cromwell and King Henry were promoting Protestant theological ideas beyond the political break with Rome. Cromwell issued new visitations to the monasteries charged with removing shrines, and other religious images. St. Swithun's was home to the shrine and relics of St. Swithun, a popular site of pilgrimage among local English and French.Muriel St. Clare Byrne, ed. The Lisle Letters, 6 volumes (Chicago, IL: 1981) 3:84‚Äì85. The visitors came to St. Swithun's in September 1538, and removed the shrine of St. Swithun at 3 a.m. One visitor, Thomas Wriothesley reported that Basyng and the other brothers were \\"conformable\\" to the destruction of the images within the Cathedral.Diarmaid MacCulloch, Thomas Cranmer: A Life, (New Haven, CT: 1996) p. 228; Thomas Wright, Three Chapters of Letters Relating to the Suppression of the Monasteries, (London: 1843) pp. 218‚Äì220. A year later, Basyng surrendered the priory to King Henry, and the church was converted into a 'new college' and Basyng was appointed guardian. At the surrender of the monastery, Basyng dropped his monastic name in favour of his family name, Kingsmill.L&P;, Volume 15, No. 139; David Knowles, The Religious Orders in England, Volume 3: The Tudor Age, (Cambridge, U.K.: 1959) pp. 390‚Äì391. On 1 May 1541, Henry returned most of the lands and rents back to the Cathedral at Winchester, while reorganising the former priory into a chapter run by a Dean with twelve prebendiaries. Kingsmill was selected to be the first dean at what was now the Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity.G. W. Kitchen and F. T. Madge, ed. Documents Relating to the Foundation of the Chapter of Winchester (London: 1889) pp. 67‚Äì70; James A. Muller, Stephen Gardiner and the Tudor Reaction, (New York, NY: 1926) p. 100. Kingsmill's loyalty to the crown and his control over the majority of the church's wealth aided him in gaining new benefices and appointments. In 1542, Kingsmill became the vicar of Overton, Hampshire, which he held without complaint until his resignation in 1545. At the time of his resignation as vicar, he held the Rectories of Aldershot, St. Peter's, Wiltshire, Alverstoke, and Colmer.Emden, Directory of Oxford, 1540‚Äì1541, p. 31; Herbert Chitty, ed. Registra Stephani Gardiner et Johannis Pynet: Episcoporum Wintoniensium (Oxford, U.K.: 1930) pp. 116, 121. In October 1544, when Kingsmill received a dispensation to hold multiple benefices, he was listed as one of the King's Chaplains.D. S. Chambers, Faculty Office Registers, 1534‚Äì1549 (Oxford, U.K.: 1966) p. 246.

He was born in Baltimore, Maryland at the southeast corner of East Pratt and High streets, on July 29, 1838. He was educated at the old landmark buildings of Loyola High School and old Loyola College, then at North Calvert Street, between East Madison and Monument Streets, next to St. Ignatius Roman Catholic Church, in the Mount Vernon- Belvedere neighborhood, north of downtown. Later attending Mount St. Mary's College, in Frederick County's Emmitsburg campus. After working initially in the dry goods business and as a clerk in the transportation department of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, he joined the Confederate States Army at the beginning of the Civil War. He was captured in October 1864, and held as a prisoner at the Union Army's prisoner-of-war camp at Point Lookout in St. Mary's County in southern Maryland at the confluence of the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay until the close of the war. In February 1866, he founded the \\"Kernan Enterprises,\\" a combination hotel and rathskeller. In 1903, he constructed one of the more elaborate hostelieries of the city, with the Hotel Kernan and adjacent Maryland Theater facing West Franklin Street, between North Paca and just west of North Howard Streets. Later renamed the Congress Hotel, the basement tavern and rathskeller was known as the Marble Bar and known even up to the 1980s for its cutting-edge music and nightclub. Placed in the late 19th-century theatre district of the city with the construction next door earlier in 1875 of the old luxurious Academy of Music facing North Howard and West Centre Streets and next to the old Auditorium Theater, which had replaced \\"The Natatorium\\", an indoor swimming pool and gymnasium establishment to the south and the first (1875) and second (1895) buildings of the Baltimore City College (high school) to the north, with the downtown urban campus further north of the new 1876 Johns Hopkins University along Howard Street, between Centre, Little Ross, Garden, and West Monument Streets. Replacing the old Auditorium Theatre in the 1920s was the grand movie palace of the Mayfair Theatre (still standing-2014) as later the grand beaux arts Stanley Theatre replaced in the 1920s the unfortunately razed Academy of Music, with it too succumbing to the wrecker's ball in 1965, in the Howard block between Franklin and Centre. By 2005, the old Congress Hotel, shorn of its matching Maryland Theatre to the west, was gutted and renovated with an appreciation of its historical architecture into condos and apartments by a locally well-known architect and construction company of Struever Brothers, Eccles and Rouse, one of their last projects before running into unexpected financial troubles after two decades of many Baltimore renovations and restoration projects. During Kernan's lifetime, he founded a hospital between 1860 and 1866, later known as the James Lawrence Kernan Hospital located in the \\"Radnor Park\\" estate and renamed by the 2010s as the \\"University of Maryland Rehabilitation & Orthopaedic Institute\\" (part of the ever-growing University of Maryland Medical Center in downtown at West Lombard, South Greene and West Baltimore Streets) located in between the Forest Park neighborhood of northwest Baltimore and suburban Woodlawn in adjacent Baltimore County. Near the end of his life, he operated a Yiddish theater in the elaborate red-brick industrial building now known as the Hendler Creamery (a locally-famous ice cream and dairy manufacturing company) on East Baltimore Street (northeast corner, between East and Aisquith Streets) in the Jonestown/Old Town neighborhood, east of the Jones Falls, then the center of the old Jewish area of Baltimore from the 1840s to World War II.

Captain Arthur \\"Robbie\\" Burns (18 November 1917 ‚Äì June 2008) was awarded the DSO for his service during the Second World War fighting in Italy in 1944, and later had a distinguished career in the British Colonial Office and the English police. He served throughout the Italian campaign as a subaltern and later as a captain. He was wounded twice, fighting in the Anzio beachhead. He was later posted to the Middle East. In 1946, after serving in the British Palestine Mandate, he returned to the police service in his native Derbyshire. Personal Arthur Burns was born on 18 November 1917 at Darley Abbey, Derbyshire, and educated at Kedleston Road School, where he was the school swimming champion. He played soccer for Derby Boys and rugby for Derby Rugby Football Club, before going to the local technical college. Police background Burns joined the police in 1939, continuing a family tradition which had been started by his great-grandfather in 1840. After two years, during the Second World War, he volunteered for service in the British Army, being commissioned as an officer, becoming a 2nd lieutenant, and did his training in Scotland, where he acquired the nickname \\"Robbie\\". The family tradition ended when his daughter, Lynne Burns, retired from the Police Force, as a Ch Insp in the Derbyshire Constabulary in 1996. Military service Burns enlisted in the British Army in 1942, initially as a private, into the Green Howards. On completion of his officer training he was commissioned into the 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment (1DWR). The battalion was part of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, alongside 2nd Sherwood Foresters and 1st King's Shropshire Light Infantry, part of the 1st Infantry Division, then commanded by Major General Walter Clutterbuck. In late February 1943 the division was sent to the Mediterranean theatre, arriving there the following month, where it saw action in the final stages of the Tunisian Campaign until it came to an end, with almost 250,000 Axis troops surrendering, in mid-May. Italy Memorial Plaque on summit of Monte Cece (Monte Ceco), near Palazzuolo sul Senio. The division then, after participating in Operation Corkscrew in June, rested and retrained in North Africa until December when it was sent to Italy, where the campaign there had begun to bog down. The division then took part in the Anzio landings the following month, and during the fighting in the Anzio beachhead in the next few weeks Burns was twice wounded In October 1944 the 1st Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment was ordered to attack 'Monte Ceco' (Monte Cece), near Palazzuolo sul Senio, north- east of Florence after two repulsed attacks by the 2nd Foresters and the 1st KSLI. The mountain was strategically important having total command of 'Arrow Route', which was an important route north for the Allied advance. 1DWR began an assault on 6 October. During the night the attack was stopped by the CO Lt Col Sheil, and 'C' Company withdrew under heavy fire. 'A' Coy remained clinging to its position near the top. Lt Col Sheil visited Burns, who had observed that the Germans were least alert in the early afternoon. Sheil agreed with Burns suggestion that this would be the best time to attack the Germans. A second attack took place at about 15:30 on 8 October. 'C' Company led the advance with 'A' Company in close support. 'C' Company was held up by heavy machine-gun and mortar fire on the reverse slope of the preceding ridge and Sheil was ordered to get 'A' company through. Whilst Burns and 'C' Company's commander, Captain Peter Hassle, were assessing the situation from the exposed ridge top they were joined by Lt Col Sheil. A decision was made to have 'B' Company lead the attack and have 'A' company move through them onto the crest. A burst of Spandau fire opened up on the three officers and instantly killed Lt Col Sheil and wounded Captain Hassle in the arm. Burns then took command of both 'A' and 'C' Companies and after some hurried re- consolidation the attack continued. Burns personally led two platoons in an attack on two machine gun positions on the crest. Under intense fire they took control of the ridge, wiping out the machine-gun posts in the attack. The enemy counter-attacked twice through the night of 8‚Äì9 October, but were repulsed with heavy casualties and withdrew to pre-prepared positions further north. Following the capture of Monte Cece the award of a DSO was conferred on Captain Burns. Private Richard Henry Burton, a member of Burns' company, was awarded the Victoria Cross, for gallantry, in that same action. Captain Burns citation in the December supplement to the London Gazette read: Burns served with 1DWR in Palestine during the Palestine Emergency after the war. On demobilisation, he returned to Derby as a constable, until his DSO ribbon was spotted by the Chief Constable. He was then promoted rapidly to command the Derby CID. Post World War II police career In 1956 he was hand picked to the Colonial Office for two years' duty in Cyprus as an Assistant Commissioner of Police during the EOKA campaign. He was awarded a Colonial Police Medal at the end of his tour. He served as Deputy Chief Constable of Norwich City, and later in the same position in Essex. He subsequently became Chief Constable of Suffolk.

Childhood and education His father, John Calvin Ferguson (1866‚Äì1945) had taken a degree in theology from Boston University before he went to China in 1887 on behalf of the Methodist Episcopal Church to establish the University of Nanking and became its first president. John Calvin Ferguson became an expert on Chinese art, and the owner and publisher of two Shanghai newspapers, Sin Wan Pao and The Shanghai Times, while his career extended into the area of Chinese government service. From 1907 Ferguson and his seven siblings divided their time between China and Newton, Massachusetts. Duncan Ferguson was educated at colleges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. He did some studies in economics and English literature at Harvard University. First marriage Ferguson left Brown University where he had received a teaching appointment in the English Department and instead took a position in Harvard's Fine Arts Department. Around this time Ferguson married Mary Manley; they separated in 1926, and later divorced. Museum exhibits Following a psychological crisis (in 1924 he attempted suicide and was hospitalized; in his later life he sometimes would exhibit suicidal behaviour and threaten suicide) he eventually became established as a sculptor of distinction, creating a large number of works of sculpture always remarkable for their classical serenity and great individuality. He settled in New York and his works were displayed at the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum, among other venues. In 1929, a one-man art show at Halpert's Downtown Gallery marked the zenith of his New York period. In 1931 he married his second wife, Alice Decker; this marriage, however, ended when she left him in 1936. In the mid-1930s, he began an academic career joining Louisiana State University, becoming instructor first, then assistant professor (sculpture, wood carving, stone cutting). At that time he also received a series of commissions occupying him with architectural sculpture such as reliefs. Political radicalization In 1939, he underwent some fundamental transformations in political thinking, social behaviour and personal habits. He became radicalized and labelled himself a Trotskyist. Ferguson would go on to translate, among other writings, Trotsky's Nationalized Industry and Workers' Management (written in 1938). Cannon and Morrow with Ferguson's Trotsky-bust He left New Orleans, where he had married his third wife, Demila Sanders, and moved to Gambier, Ohio. At the end of 1941 Demila went to New York, shortly thereafter Ferguson arrived there, and they took a loft on West 21st Street in Manhattan, New York. Demila and Duncan Ferguson met with such Socialist Workers Party (SWP) leaders as J. Cannon, A. Goldman and F. Morrow. After having rejected the offer to become chairman of the Arts Department of Queens College, he found employment at the Crucible Steel plant where he worked as a lathe operator. He became a union shop steward and a delegate to the SWP's national conventions. In January 1944 the Fergusons went to Mexico on behalf of the SWP in order to care for Leon Trotsky's widow, Natalia Sedova, who continued to live in the house Coyoac√°n, a suburb of Mexico City, where Trotsky had been assassinated in August 1940. Demila complained about the conditions in Mexico and left at the end of 1944; Ferguson followed her to New York. For many years he was an active SWP member, writing articles under pseudonyms and doing translations from French language material. In the 1940s he was a member of the National Committee of the Civil Rights Committee, for several years he ran Pioneer Publishers (the SWP publishing house) and from 1956 to 1958 he was managing editor of the International Socialist Review, the theoretical journal of the SWP. Later he was a member of the National Control Commission of the SWP. Among the few pieces of sculpture, which Ferguson completed after becoming chiefly a party worker, were busts of Trotsky and James P. Cannon. Demila ultimately left her husband and, after a period of depression, Ferguson began an affair with Laura Slobe, an artist and member of the SWP. Their affair ended after a few years and she died in 1958. By the mid-1950s Ferguson's health worsened, so that he had to abandon his job and live off dividends from stock left to him by his father, who had died in 1945. Last marriage He remarried, this time to Cleo Bell, a ceramist, and became committed to making some artistic comeback. In the meanwhile he had settled in Cleveland where he advanced to a new and final stage in his effort to unify his political and artistic lives. Troubles in his personal life continued and his relationship with Cleo also ended in divorce. Last years and death In the 1960s he suffered a large stroke followed by some small ones, causing severe neurological problems. He spent his last years of life partly in Cleveland, partly in Southern California. In 1973 he discovered that he had advanced cancer. He went to California for treatment. He slipped into a coma and died in a nursing home at Santa Monica, California on April 29, 1974, aged 73. Ferguson's papers are kept at the Archives of American Art of the Smithsonian Institution.

Caws was born the son of Silas Harvey Caws and his wife, Emma Matilda (n√©e Cave). Frank married Catherine Francis Riddett of Ryde at St Helens Church Isle of Wight on 4 February 1868.  His architectural activities  Frank Caws was articled to Thomas Hellyer of Ryde Isle of Wight (1860-4). Following which, he worked at South Kensington Museum, returned to Thomas Hellyer as assistant 1864. Assistant to John Ross of Darlington with North Eastern Railway Co., George Bidlake of Wolverhampton and senior assistant to Joseph Potts of Sunderland 1867. Frank commenced independent practice in Sunderland 1870. Frank Caws was elected Fellow of RIBA 5 June 1893. Caws' buildings in Sunderland include the Elephant Tea Rooms, Corder House, Sydenham House and the terraced Holmlands Park in Ashbrooke. In 1874, a competition was held for Sunderland Town Hall on a site in Mowbray Park. The design the committee most liked was by Frank Caws, but this was disqualified for exceeding the stated cost. The new design competition for a town hall on Fawcett Street took place. This competition was judged by Alfred Waterhouse and won by the little known architect Brightwen Binyon, who had worked in Waterhouse‚Äôs office. The competition were dogged by accusations of corruption, but the building was built. Caws' other constructions include Seaview Pier, and New Dukes House, near Hexham.  His other activities  As well as his architectural activities in Sunderland, Frank was also involved with social improvement in the area. In 1871 he was involved with establishing the YMCA in Sunderland and was their first Honorary Secretary until 1875. In 1887 Frank was awarded the contract for a new Sunderland YMCA building (which has long since vanished). On a cold evening in the winter of 1901, (so the story goes), Frank found a 9 year old, barefoot and ragged match seller sheltering on the stairs of his office and Frank decided there and then to do something about it. Frank solicited support from his professional friends in Sunderland and the Waifs Rescue Agency & Street Vendor‚Äôs Club was formed as a charity with premises in Lambton Street. The doors were opened 2 January 1902 and Frank held the powerful position of Honorary Secretary until his death in 1905. The Waifs Rescue Agency & Street Vendor‚Äôs Club was later renamed the Lambton Street Youth Centre and continues into the 21st century claiming to be 'one of the oldest youth centres in Europe'.  His death  Frank Caws died in the evening on 8 April 1905 aged 58 at his home in Sunderland following a trip to London during which he caught a chill and developed pneumonia. Frank is buried in Bishopwearmouth Cemetery.  After his death  After Frank's death, his name lived on in the title of the partnership Messrs Frank Caws, Steel and Caws of Sunderland, one partner being Frank's son, Francis Douglas Caws (1884 to 1951), the other partner being William Steele (born 1874). Their work included St Luke's Parish Hall, Wallsend built in 1909, and the Swan Hunter Memorial Hall, Wigham opened in 1925 in memory of the men of Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd. who died in the 1914-18 war.

Biography The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Carl H. Michael, she was born in Talladega, Alabama. She graduated from Talladega High school at the age of 14. In her youth, she played piano and organ, and she began Little Theatres in two communities. She became a singer on the radio. Michael attended the University of Alabama, where she studied law, and Converse College, Spartanburg, South Carolina, pursuing a study of music. Then she went to the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music to continue studying music. Her work there earned her a scholarship for studying five years in Italy. Her childhood home in Talladega, Alabama was destroyed by fire in 2007. In 1929 in Cincinnati she made her stage debut in the Stuart Walker stock theater company. She subsequently appeared on Broadway in Rachel Crothers' Caught Wet (1931). She entered the movies playing Richard Arlen's fianc√©e in Wayward (1932), but her best-remembered role is probably either as Rita Ross in Murder at the Vanities (1934), one of the last pre-Code films, in which she sang an ode to marijuana (Sweet Marijuana) or as Alica Hatton, the snooty society girl in the Mae West comedy I'm No Angel (1933). Among her television appearances, Michael was seen eleven times on Fireside Theater between 1950-1955 and three times on Schlitz Playhouse. She also made a guest appearance on Perry Mason in 1958 as Helen Rucker in \\"The Case of the Sun Bather's Diary.\\" She had an affair with writer Paul Cain (aka Peter Ruric). After they broke up, Cain wrote the role of the alcoholic lover (based on Michael) in his only novel published during his lifetime, Fast One. Michael died, aged 53, from undisclosed causes, in Beverly Hills, California.

It is one of Derby's city centre churches which is in full use for worship. The church building dates from the 11th century. The tower has a peal of eight bells, which are rung before the Sunday morning services.St Peter's Church website, accessed February 2009 The church and its boundary walls were awarded Grade II* listed status in 1952. Church History First recorded around the reign of Edward the Confessor, around 1042 onwards, the church is recorded, along with three other churches in Derby, in the Domesday Book of 1086. In 1137 the church came under the jurisdiction of the Abbots of nearby Darley Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries. Rebuilding in 1338 instigated by the first curate, John de Crich, saw the south aisle and Chantry added. Although significantly rebuilt around 1350 in the decorated style the church retains Norman features at the eastern end of the church on the east wall of the nave and the arcade responds. Five light windows survive in the south and north aisles from the 14th century. The church is the only medieval church remaining in the city centre. The original steeply-pitched roof was lowered in 1509, the walls over the nave arcades raised and clerestory windows inserted. The chancel arch was widened and the east end was shortened by a bay and a new east window installed. The tower was also rebuilt at this time. The bells, a familiar sound to Derbians, were cast and hung around 1636 and are still in regular use, one having never needed recasting. The late 18th century saw galleries added to the nave but, in 1852 the chancel was restored and the pews, along with the impropriator's (lay rector's, see Chancel repair liability) gallery removed. Plaster was also removed and old roof timbers exposed. In the same decade the chancel and aisles were again restored and the large galleries at the west end of the nave removed. 1865 saw the south porch removed, the organ chamber made at the east end of the north aisle. In 1898, the west end of church and tower rebuilt were entirely rebuilt with great sympathy for the existing ancient east end of the church. In 1970, the present church and parish rooms, including meeting rooms, coffee rooms, office, kitchen and toilet facilities were added to the west end below the tower. Historic Events The Black Death visited Derby in 1349; a third of the population died, including sixty clergy, one of whom was the vicar of St Peter's. In 1530 Robert Liversage established a chapel for divine service. Each Friday, thirteen poor men and women were paid a silver penny for attending. People fought to be among the thirteen. The Liversage Almshouses are nearby on London Road, the vicar and churchwardens being ex-officio trustees because Robert Liversage‚Äôs 1531 will bequeathed most of his property to benefit the parish poor. Joan Waste, a St Peter's parishioner and blind rope maker, was tried for heresy at what is now Derby Cathedral in 1556.A history of the Life, Trial, & Execution of Joan Waste... , Foxe's Book of Martyrs, 1563 She refused to deny her faith and was burned at the stake at Windmill Pit near Burton Road. The plague again broke out in Derby in 1586, starting in St Peter's parish. Around 1650, Oliver Cromwell stole an Elizabethan chair that had been presented to St Peter‚Äôs in 1593. Amazingly, the chair was discovered at auction in 1960, and a churchwarden was able to negotiate its return. Robert Bakewell, the British metalsmith, who died in 1752, is buried in the churchyard. William Cowper is said to have written, in 1768, the hymn Hark my Soul it is the Lord in the upper vestry at St Peter's. Organ A pipe organ by Elliot dating from 1820 was replaced by a new organ by Forster and Andrews of Hull which was opened on 18 August 1852. A new organ by J.H. Adkins of Derby was donated in memory of Sir Edwin T. Ann by Lady Ann and dedicated on 23 November 1921 The current pipe organ was installed in 1986 by Cousans of Lincoln A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

The window was originally commissioned in the late 1950s for the chapel at the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary, which has moved operations to Mickleover and is due for redevelopment. On 9 October 2010, the church rededicated the window in a service featuring the Hospital Choir and the Rolls Royce Male Voice Choir with original music by Dana and Anne de Waal. The Rt Rev Alastair Redfern, Bishop of Derby, presided. Although thought was given to closing the church because of small congregations in the late 1960s, the church now plays an important and active role in the City of Derby. In the summer of 2011, the second Derby BID (Business Improvement District) was formed with St Peter's Church at its geographical centre. The St Peter's Quarter exists to promote and enhance the area, as does the nearby Cathedral Quarter. Early in 2012, the church was enhanced to continue serving the community as it has for a thousand years. The improvements have enabled the church, as a building and a mission, to offer the St Peter's Quarter, and the city as a whole, a variety of services. Derby City Chaplaincy uses St Peter's as its central hub. The innovative \\"Christmas Lunch on Jesus\\" project has, for the last three years, provided many Derby families with a Christmas hamper delivered to their door.

Biography His father was Nikolay Nikolaevich Ter-Grigoryan, an accomplished teacher of music and the piano. Eiramdzhan was born in 1937 in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR. Anatoly Eiramdzhan's mother, whose surname was taken by Anatoly, was Arevik Nikitichna Eiramdzhan - the grand daughter of the famous Armenian writer Ghazaros Aghayan (1840‚Äì1911). In 1961 Eiramdzhan graduated from the Azerbaijan Institute of Oil and Chemistry. In 1972 he completed a three-year program at the Screenplay branch of the High Course of Scriptwriters and Movie Directors (conducted by I. Olshansky). After graduating he began writing movie scripts. Eiramdzhan was also the author of short comic stories. He was honored as a winner of the prestigious \\"Golden Calf award\\" from the \\"Literary Newspaper\\" for 1972 - 1973. In 1989 Eiramdzhan began producing films from his own scripts. The film studio New Odeon was formed in Moscow in 1992 by Eiramdzhan to focus on creating low budget comedies. He also took on the responsibilities of screenwriter, art director and film director. During his career at New Odeon, Eiramdzhan was responsible for the creation of twenty films. In 1995 the publishing house Author, Inc. of Moscow published Eiramdzhan's first book, titled The Ladies' Man and Other Comedy Films. Eiramdzhan's films consistently receive very high ratings and have large theatre and TV audiences. In 2006 the publishing house Golos-Press published his second book, titled From Everyone One Thread. Since 2003 Eiramdzhan lived and worked in Miami, FL with his wife Oksana and his son Koka (Nikolay). Eiramdzhan died in Miami, Florida September 23, 2014 in the age 77. The death came from cardiac arrest.http://svpressa.ru/culture/news/99057/ Filmography ; as scriptwriter * Fellows Villager (1973) - scriptwriter * What There is Our Life? - The Film-Almanac ¬´Au-Uu!¬ª (1975) scriptwriter * Let's Meet at the Fountain (1976) - scriptwriter * If I Would Be the Chief (1980) - scriptwriter * Where It Will Get To?!

For the way to remove fast and cheap it is compared with Ed Wood, this similarity is noted and the Eiramdzhan in an interview: \\"Many of the actions of this Director are clear to me, as probably few people, I have a lot in common with him and I am offended that he is considered the worst director in America.\\" The name Eiramjan is often used as a common noun to refer to cinema povera, \\"poor cinema, thrash\\".. At the same time, the critic Igor Mantsov described the Eiramdzhan as \\"the most stable, accurate and professional (yea, yea!) cinematographer of the decade\\" (i.e. 1990s), \\"a true knight of low-budget cinema\\", who \\"on scanty money in a situation of complete collapse of the film industry managed to give out one movie farce after another\\" and in which \\"only the lazy person did not spit¬ª.

He was the fourth son in a family of nine boys and one girl, the children of William Bulfin, of Derrinlough, Birr, County Offaly, Ireland, and Margaret Grogan of Croghan, County Offaly. History He attended the national school in Cloghan, where he is said to have been taught by the father of Easter Rising leader Thomas MacDonagh, the Classical Academy and the Presentation Schools in Birr, and the Royal Charter School at Banagher. His maternal uncle, Father Vincent Grogan, was Provincial of the Passionist Fathers in a province that included a monastery in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Bulfin emigrated to Argentina in 1884 with his elder brother Peter and they moved to the pampas. Hundreds of Irish emigrants from Counties Longford and Westmeath had settled in Argentina. The Bulfins had with them letters of introduction to the Passionist Fathers in Buenos Aires, and went to the estancia (ranch) of one of these, Don Juan Dowling from Longford. There he met the woman he would marry, Anne O‚ÄôRourke from Ballacurra, Ballymore, Westmeath. On the pampas, his preference was for the company of the gauchos and the Irish. Observing his countrymen and the hard-riding Spanish-Indian cowboys he began to write homely sketches and stories about their lives for The Southern Cross, a weekly paper in Buenos Aires owned and edited by Michael Dineen from Cork. Years later, he wrote in The Southern Cross about the vanishing gaucho in a way that showed how closely he had observed and how he had been attracted by the vivid pattern of life on the Argentinian grasslands. \\"He had his ranch and his horses and his work at trooping or marking or herding sheep, and he drank his anis or cana, and took his mate under his own fig tree, and gambled with bone or cards or on horse- racing at the pulper√≠as of all the camps from the Arroyo Luna to the Medano Blanco, and along the frontier from Gainza to Melincu√©.\\" In 1902, after relocating to Buenos Aires, he wrote: > It was a train brought me back to Buenos Aires from the camp. I mean it was > the train which gave me the call ... [I]t happened that I had not seen a > train for four years ...

The sketches he wrote were published in The Southern Cross and also, due to his friendship with Arthur Griffith, in the United Irishman and Sinn F√©in. Eventually they reached the New York Daily News. They were published in book form in 1907 by Gill. In 1902 he wrote Rambles In Eirinn, a well-regarded account of his travels around Ireland by bicycle on his return to his homeland. He became ill during a visit to the United States fundraising with The O'Rahilly for Arthur Griffith's newspaper Sinn Fein.

He had three other daughters: Mary (d. 1930), Aileen (d. 1985) and Anita Bulfin (died 1923). His brother Patrick died in 1916.

Portrait of Gustav Mezey (1930) In the early 1920s Hungarian-born Mezey embarked upon an artistic career that would span more than four decades. His outstanding talent and pioneering spirit made him one of Europe's most recognised commercial artists of his time. Producing advertisements for several well-known companies in Budapest, Belgrade, Trieste, Berlin and Vienna, he soon specialised in large outdoor poster designs for the newly emerging film industry. From the early 1930s to the late 1950s, he created movie posters and large-scale portraits of movie stars in his unique paint/airbrush technique for most of the classic European and American film producers, including UFA, Terra, Tobis, Sascha, MGM and Rank Organisation. During this period Mezey refined his bold, exciting colour compositions to a trend-setting and unparalleled level; yet, in his lifetime, Gustav's talent and skills were only seen as professional tools of advertising.

(\\"Worldcolor\\") (formerly Quebecor World) was a company which provided high-value and comprehensive print, digital, and related services to businesses worldwide. World Color and its subsidiaries printed various commercial products, including comic books, magazines, brochures, direct mail and newspaper inserts, and directories, while also providing clients a broad range of pre-press services, such as desktop production and assembly. World Color was the first printer to make comic book printing a major part of its business plan, and throughout most of its history was the dominant North American printer of comics and associated publications. During its history, World Color was also at the forefront of many new technologies and printing innovations, including use of web offset presses, \\"pool shipping,\\" rotogravure printing, computer technology, digital registration systems, and flexography.\\"Forgiving Plate Aids Processing,\\" Graphic Arts Monthly (Dec. 1993), p. 64. World Color merged with Quebecor Printing in 1999; at the time World Color was the largest printer of consumer magazines in the United States and the third largest commercial printer in North America. Worldcolor was acquired by Quad/Graphics in early 2010.  History   World Fair Color Printing  World Color Press was founded in 1903 by the owners of the St. Louis Star under the name World's Fair Color Printing. The wholly owned subsidiary was created to handle color printing for the upcoming 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, and was expected to disband at the World Fair's conclusion. Instead, the company name was shortened to World Color Printing and continued as a commercial printer, focusing on a new business: the color \\"funnies\\" section of the Sunday newspaper.  Comics  World Color's first foray into comics was syndicating George Herriman's Major Ozone's Fresh Air Crusade from January 2, 1904, to November 19, 1906.Markstein, Don. \\"MAJOR OZONE‚ÄôS FRESH AIR CRUSADE,\\" Toonpedia. Accessed Nov. 16, 2018.

Robert Grable and Roswell Messing, Sr.,Saunders, David. \\"RAY R. HERMANN,\\" Field Guide to Wild American Pulp Artists. Accessed Sept. 23, 2017. two St. Louis Star senior employees, purchased the company in 1922. As the popularity of the Sunday color comic section increased, the funnies quickly evolved into an American institution, and metropolitan papers increasingly began featuring comic supplements. As the first major printer of color sections, World Color Press was often the first choice for printing these sections, and by the early 1930s, the company had printing contracts with newspapers nationwide. In the early 1930s, realizing the sales potential of the comics medium, company management attempted to maximize profits by reprinting the funnies in magazine format, thereby creating one of the first prototypes of the comic book. While the initial comic books were simply collections of previously published editions of the Sunday comic strips, by 1936 they contained original material. World Color made the most of the idea and quickly emerged as the leading printer in this new field. To keep up with ever-increasing demand, the company began construction of a satellite printing plant in Sparta, Illinois. Opened in 1948, the Sparta plant was the most technologically advanced plant in the industry devoted solely to the printing of comic magazines. Within five years World Color Press became the largest producer of comic magazines in the industry.Ynostroza, Roger, \\"The Colorful World of World Color Press,\\" Graphic Arts Monthly (June 1978), pp. 56‚Äì58. Comic book sales boomed during World War II and the postwar period, and throughout this period, World Color was the nation's leading comic book printer. (Comics were the most popular form of newsstand magazine.) In 1956, the company installed one of the first web-offset presses in its Sparta plant. This innovative printing process, in which rolls or \\"webs\\" of paper are fed through rubber-blanketed cylinders, producing tens of thousands of impressions an hour, helped lead the industry into the modern era of print technology. By the early 1970s, World Color purchased more equipment and expanded their plants, becoming the largest player in the comic and newsstand special- interest publication market.Rozanski, Chuck. \\"Tales From the Database: Evolution of the Direct Market Part II,\\" Mile High Comics (2003). By the early 1980s World Color Press printed most American comic books, including those of the industry giants Marvel and DC.Carlson, KC. \\"KC Column: Scaling Mount Baron,\\" Westfield Comics (Nov. 16, 2009). World Color's dominance in the field led to a 1984 lawsuit by Illinois-based First Comics, accusing them of anti- competitive practices.\\"First Comics Sues Marvel Comics for Anti-Competitive Activities,\\" The Comics Journal #89 (May 1984), p. 8: Involves World Color Press. The suit was resolved in the spring of 1988.\\"First vs. Marvel and World Color,\\" The Comics Journal #102 (September 1985), pp. 11‚Äì14.\\"First Awaits Court Verdict,\\" The Comics Journal #121 (April 1988), p. 8. In 1985, DC Comics named World Color Press as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great.  Diversification and growth  The development of the web-press in the 1950s enabled World Color to further diversify into the relatively new product lines of web-printed newsstand and special interest magazines. Equally important to the company's growth during the 1950s was its development of the \\"pool shipping\\" concept, a distribution method in which publications from different customers going to the same destination were shipped together, reducing freight costs and increasing the timeliness of deliveries. By establishing the first major pool shipping network to newsstands, the company was able to expand its customer base by offering the lowest distribution costs in the industry. World Color computerized many aspects of its business in the 1960s, providing the company with more efficient production and distribution capabilities, as well as the ability to perform more complicated printing procedures and reproduce more complex data. In 1969, World Color started construction of a web-offset facility in Effingham, Illinois, approximately 120 miles northeast of Sparta. The new plant was designed to produce magazines printed on coated paper with extensive use of four-color printing. Success in this arena led to a 1971 expansion of the Effingham plant that nearly doubled its original size. The 1971 addition increased the company's ability to produce large-circulation monthly magazines printed on letter-press equipment. Responding to a need to increase the company's flexibility in scheduling presses, in 1970, the company standardized the make and type of its presses.\\"World Color Shortens Cutoff,\\" Graphic Arts Monthly (May 1986), p. 54. This change was expected to result in paper savings, more consistent quality, and schedule flexibility. Though it was a short-term risk, the strategy paid off with its clients, enabling the company to become a stronger competitor in the four-color, high-quality magazine market. In 1975, the company expanded its gravure division by constructing a plant between Effingham and Sparta. Further expansions in client-base led to the 1980 construction of another new plant in Des Plaines, Illinois. By the beginning of the 1980s, the company had emerged as the leader in the printing and distribution of consumer publications, with sales of more than $371 million.Estabrook, Jody, \\"Market Strategy is Client-Oriented,\\" Graphic Arts Monthly (May 1990), pp. 126‚Äì130. During the 1980s, World Color added seven state-of-the-art printing facilities, strategically located throughout the United States, strengthening the company's reputation for providing low distribution costs.Hattrup, Joseph A., \\"Programmable Controllers in the Magazine Bindery,\\" Graphic Arts Monthly (June 1985), pp. 91‚Äì92. In 1985, World Color Press was listed as the fourth largest printer in North America, with sales totaling $544 million. By 1993, World Color's core business was magazine printing; contracts with hundreds of leading periodicals, including U.S. News & World Report, Cosmopolitan, Rolling Stone, and Forbes, accounted for approximately half of the company's 1993 revenues. (The company came to the aid of competitor R.R. Donnelley & Sons in January 1995, printing 300,000 issues of People magazine for Donnelley after flood waters forced the closing of a Donnelley plant near Los Angeles.)\\"To Our Readers,\\" People (Jan. 23, 1995), p. 4. During this period, World Color expanded its operations into a number of specialty services: catalog printing contracts generated more than a fifth of total revenues in 1993, and represented the company's fastest growing division.  Business acquisitions and mergers  World Color's early dominance in the comics market led the company to diversify, their first move being the 1928 purchase of another St. Louis-based printer, Commercial Color Press, which specialized in printing weekly newspapers and circulars. This diversification helped the company survive the lean years of the Great Depression. In 1968, World Color was purchased by New York-based City Investing, prompting World Color to move its headquarters from St. Louis to New York. In 1974, as World Color shifted focus to the high-end magazine market, the company purchased Louisville, Kentucky- based Fawcett Printing. This acquisition enabled World Color Press to add the rotogravure printing process to its repertoire. In 1984, the investment giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. bought World Color from City Investing, providing the company with continued financial backing. In 1989, World Color acquired Chicago's Bradley Printing, and in December 1991, they acquired California's third-largest printer, George Rice & Sons.\\"World Color to Buy George Rice & Sons,\\" Printing Impressions (Jan. 1994), p. 5. In January 1993, they purchased catalog/direct mail printer Alden Press.\\"Hot Presses,\\" Delaney Report (Jan. 25, 1993).\\"Company News: Kohlberg Unit to Buy Alden Press,\\" New York Times (Jan. 19, 1993). With these acquisitions, in just a few years World Color became a major player in the catalog and commercial publishing arenas.\\"KKR's World Color Sets Another Acquisition,\\" Buyouts (Dec. 6, 1993). World Color pursued major expansions in 1996 and 1997, purchasing Ringier America and Rand McNally's Book Services Group, thereby becoming second in size only to RR Donnelley. In 1999, the company merged with Quebecor Printing in a U.S. $2.7 billion deal to create Quebecor World (USA) Inc., moving its headquarters to Montreal. At the time of the merger, World Color operated 17 production, distribution, and sales facilities throughout the United States.  Financial struggles  Quebecor World entered a difficult period in the early 2000s as the market has gradually shifted focus to digital media. Quebecor World filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 21, 2008, at the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. In May 2009, RR Donnelley tendered an unsolicited bid to purchase Quebecor World;\\"U.S. printer to swallow former Quebecor World,\\" CBS News (Jan. 26, 2010). this was rejected as the company emerged from creditor protection in July 2009 (having changed its name back to \\"Worldcolor Press\\"). On July 2, 2010, Quad/Graphics purchased Worldcolor.  Locations  By the time of its purchase by Quad/Graphics, Worldcolor had facilities located in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Peru.

The theater opened in 1940 and is still operating. The Civic is a historical site and annually draws about 75,000 to downtown Farmington.Official website History The (Farmington) Civic Theatre was constructed in 1939/1940 and officially opened in late September 1940. The movie theatre was built on the site of a vacant A&P; Supermarket, which was torn down to make way for the new theatre. The property was owned by Louis Rose (Louis Rose Builders-Detroit). He was also primarily responsible for the construction of the new building. The plans called for Associate Theatres Inc. to operate the movie business operations. The company operated a string of movie houses throughout Detroit and Michigan at the time. Edward Hohler became the Manager of the Civic Theatre and stayed on when the business was taken over by Community Theaters in 1943. The Farmington Enterprise, January 11, 1940 Hohler, who died in 1989, purchased the business in 1951 and remained manager until his son Gregory took over in 1973. Greg Hohler purchased the theater building from the Louis Rose estate in 1989. He made a number of investments in the theatre until its sale to the City in 1999.. This included closing the theater for the first time in its history for a five-week remodeling. The balcony became the upstairs theater. Farmington and Farmington Hills-The Making of America Series, Debra Pawlek, 2003. In 1999 The City of Farmington bought the Farmington Civic Theater from the Hohler family. The Hohler family had operated the theater since its 1940 opening. Right after purchasing the theater, the City renovated, adding new seating, a new roof and updated the lobby, concessions area, and restrooms. Now The Farmington Civic Theater has a blade marquee and facade in shades of red and off-white. The main floor seats 275 while the upper theater seats 132. Seating in the Civic's upper theater is ‚Äústadium seating‚Äù style auditorium. The theater has daily showings of intermediate and second-run movies. The theater removed 35mm projectors and older technical equipment in July 2013 and converted to digital projection with Dolby Surround 7.1. Location The Civic is located at 33332 Grand River Avenue in Farmington, Michigan. It is just east of the Farmington Road and Grand River Avenue intersection in Downtown Farmington. Surrounding the Civic are over 150 stores, restaurants and shops. It is also located just 10 minutes away from 12 Oaks Mall in Novi, Michigan. The Farmington Civic Theater is less than 30 minutes from Detroit.

The programme stars James Bolam as a grandfather who owns a magical \\"shrinking cap\\", which only his 8-year-old grandson Jason Mason (played by Jay Ruckley) knows about. This cap enables him to shrink to about 4 inches tall, become a CGI-animated character, run very fast, and bring toys and objects to life. This allows him to experience many amazing adventures which are narrated by Jason, including finding a prisoner under the floorboards, bringing a home-made robot to life, and driving Jason's toy car and biplane. The programme also stars Josie Cable, Zara Ramm and Sam Ellis, as Jason's sister, mother and father, respectively. According to the BBC press office, \\"Grandpa In My Pocket explores the hugely important relationship between grandchildren and grandparents by turning it on its head\\" Following the success of the first series, a second was commissioned in March 2009, with a third filmed in 2010, after the third season, the series was assumed to have ended, however over 2 years later, a fourth season went into production, in the year 2013, before airing 4 years after filming commenced on the third season. A fourth series was produced in 2013 with broadcast beginning in 2014. The fourth season introduces some changes to the plot. Jason, who is now a teenager, has moved with his family into a windmill which they have opened as a hotel. Jason and Jemima's younger cousins Josh and Elsie (played by Harvey Thorn and Sezen Djouma) have come to stay for the summer, and the two become the series narrators as Grandpa decides to let them in on the secret of the shrinking cap. Aldeburgh house used in the show Production The first three series of the show was set in the fictional location called \\"Sunnysands\\". The exterior scenes were filmed on location in the towns of Southwold and Aldeburgh, in Suffolk. The Masons' house was in Crabbe Street, Aldeburgh. The pier and the lighthouse were in Southwold. The bike and other shops were in Walberswick. The Masons' windmill for the fourth series is Cley Windmill, located in Cley next the Sea in Norfolk. A similar idea was used in The Dandy comic in the 1970s comic adventure strip Peter's Pocket Grandpa, which was based on an earlier prose text story called Jimmie's Pocket Grandpa which had appeared in The Dandy in the 1940s. This was parodied in the adult satirical comic, Viz, with its strip entitled \\"Mickey's Miniature Grandpa\\", who only thought he could shrink, but lacked the actual ability.

A German that came with his family to America at the age of eight years, the American Civil War veteran started at the lowest level in glass making, and learned every aspect of the business.This information is from his front-page obituary in the Hartford City News - \\"H. Crimmel Drops Dead on Street\\". He was described as \\"prominent in the glass industry, and was well and favorably known throughout the country.\\" Additional information can be found in the Twelfth Census of the United States (1900), which confirms that he entered the country in 1852 from Germany. A skilled glassblower known for his glassmaking expertise and the recipient of two patents, he also worked in management in at least three glass factories ‚Äì and was one of the co-founders of the Novelty Glass Company (of Fostoria) and the reorganized version of Sneath Glass Company. He retired with over 50 years in the industry. Identity and origins In 1852, the Crimmel family emigrated from the Hessen region of what is now Germany to South Wheeling, Virginia. Wheeling had a German population that may have attracted the family.According to Wheeling's Centre Market web site History of Centre Market, one out of every five residents in 1850 was born in Germany. Market Immigrants from this time period often, upon arrival in the United States, would ride trains to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and then ride in boats down the Ohio River to settle in cities along way. An alternative route to Wheeling (from Baltimore) involved the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and/or the National Road.Although the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad did not reach Wheeling until the end of 1852, the National Road was completed from Cumberland, Maryland to well-beyond Wheeling by 1839. Thus, immigrants arriving in Baltimore could take the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad as far west as possible, and then they could finish their journey on the National Road. By the end of 1852, the B&O; Railroad service reached Wheeling. See \\"Primer on Emigration, Immigration & Associated Subjects\\", \\"Tips for Determining Your Ancestor's Probable Port of Arrival\\", and \\"City of Baltimore Comprehensive Master Plan ‚Äì The History of Baltimore\\" for general information on immigration. Although Hessians had been making glass since the Middle Ages,Hessian glassmaking is exhibited in Germany's Immenhausen Glass Museum. Museum it is not known if the Crimmel family members learned glassmaking skills in Europe. However, Henry Crimmel's father and both brothers were also glassmakers.In addition, to various books and articles on glass that mention the Crimmels, the 1870 (among others) U.S. Census lists John, Henry, and Jacob Crimmel as glassblowers living at different addresses in Bellaire, Ohio (across the river from Wheeling). H.Crimmel 1880 Henry's father, Johannes, was employed in the glass business -- see page 1 of A. Clyde Crimmel's The Glass Business and the Crimmels. Germans were being recruited to work in glass factories during the 1850s. By the 1870s, family members lived across the river from Wheeling in Bellaire, Ohio. American Civil War Henry Crimmel in uniform about 1862.On December 20, 1860, the state of South Carolina adopted an ordinance to secede from the Union of the United States, and six more southern states seceded in the next three months. On April 12, 1861 the Battle of Fort Sumter marked the start of the American Civil War. More southern states rebelled and voted to secede from the union, including Virginia on April 17, 1861.See MyCivilWar.com web site. -Virginia Secedes from the Union. There are numerous books and articles written about the American Civil War. One of the more thorough writings is a three-volume set written by Shelby Foote titled The Civil War: A Narrative. These \\"rebel\\" states organized themselves into the Confederate States of America. The city of Bellaire, located in Ohio across the Ohio River from the state of Virginia and the city Wheeling, assumed some strategic importance because of the railroads on both sides of the river and the fact that the Ohio River served as the border between the state of Ohio (pro-Union) and the state of Virginia (voted to secede from the Union). Bellaire became a staging area for Ohio and Indiana Union troops to cross into the South and move by rail using the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. There was some fear that rebels from Virginia would cross into Ohio through Bellaire. A training camp was located in the city, and numerous soldiers passed through the town to fight in the south.Camp Jefferson was the training camp located in Bellaire. See web page titled Camp Jefferson. It is therefore not surprising that 17-year-old Henry Crimmel enlisted to fight in the Civil War. Many of the workers at South Wheeling's Hobbs Glass works also enlisted. Blackford County Civil War monument in Hartford City, Indiana.Henry Crimmel was part of Company I of the Second Virginia Volunteer Cavalry, which fought for the Union instead of the Confederacy. The Second (West) Virginia Cavalry was composed mainly of recruits from Ohio. The governor of Ohio declined to organize this cavalry, so it was organized in Virginia. It is not extraordinary for someone that lived in southern Ohio (such as Bellaire) to identify with Wheeling, since some of those citizens of Ohio worked on the Virginia side of the river. Although the city of Wheeling was part of the state of Virginia, the city is located in the north, and there was dissent in the Wheeling area about secession.The Wheeling Convention was an important milestone for the creation of West Virginia. See \\"A State of Convenience: The Creation of West Virginia\\" web site by the West Virginia Division of Culture and History. The western portion of Virginia, which included Wheeling, eventually became a separate state known as West Virginia, which was loyal to the Union. Henry Crimmel began his military career as a private, and finished as a bugler.Because of misspellings, he is listed three times in the National Park Service Civil War Directory, as (1) Henry Cremmel; (2) Henry Crimmell; and (3) Henry Crimmil. All \\"three\\" of these soldiers are listed as part of the 2nd Regiment, West Virginia Cavalry, Company I. The National Park Service labels this regiment as a West Virginia Cavalry, which is the name used toward the end of the war. Crimmel should not be confused with the Henry Grimmel that fought in the Missouri cavalry (union) or the Henry Grimmel that fought in the Virginia Infantry (Confederate). By the end of the war, Crimmel's cavalry unit was known as Company I of the 2nd Regiment, West Virginia Cavalry. During the war, the Regiment lost a total of 196 men that were killed, mortally wounded, or died from disease. The 2nd Regiment West Virginia Cavalry served in West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland ‚Äì including a battle in Lynchburg against an army under the command of Confederate General Jubal Early that involved a total of 40,000 troops. A battle in Winchester (a.k.a. Opequon) matched a total of 54,000 troops under command of General Philip Sheridan for the Union and General Jubal Early for the rebels. This Union victory is considered by many historians to be the most important battle of the Shenandoah Valley campaign.The National Park Service Civil War web site lists service for various units. Search the Regiments selecting Union, West Virginia, Cavalry, and 2. Some of the service for the 2nd Regiment, West Virginia Cavalry included battles at Lynchburg (June 17‚Äì18, 1864) and Winchester (September 19, 1864). Although Crimmel was already discharged by 1865, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry was at Appomattox for General Robert E. Lee's surrender. Crimmel served in the cavalry from 1861 until November 1864, when he was honorably discharged. Henry Crimmel's name on Blackford Civil War monument. After the war, Henry Crimmel joined the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization for Union Civil War veterans. He was the original officer of the guard for the local chapter.See page 183 of McKelvey's A Centennial History of Belmont County, Ohio, and Representative Citizens. This book was first published in 1903, and has been republished since then. Portions have been posted on the internet. His name is on at least two monuments honoring veterans of the Civil War. One is located in his original American hometown of Bellaire, Ohio. Eleven of the 41 soldiers listed on the Bellaire monument fought for West Virginia units instead of Ohio. At least two of these West Virginia soldiers (Henry Crimmel and John Robinson) were known to have worked in the glass business.See \\"Remembering Bellaire's Civil War Heroes\\" web site. John Robinson worked at the Hobbs, Brockunier & Company glass works in Wheeling before the war. He also co-founded the Belmont Glass Company, Bellaire Goblet Company, and Robinson Glass Company. (See web article by Iwen.) The other monument with Henry Crimmel's name on it is the Blackford County Civil War monument (see photos), located in Hartford City, Indiana. Mr. Crimmel spent the last 23 years of his life in Hartford City, and he is buried in the city's main cemetery. Glassmaking ‚Äì the early years The Wheeling- Bellaire region was a good location for manufacturing because of its fuel and transportation resources. Bellaire (Belmont County) had coal, railroad service, and the Ohio River. Wheeling also had railroad service and the Ohio River. The National Road went through both cities. The first known glass factory for which Henry Crimmel worked was the Hobbs works in Wheeling, (West) Virginia.This glass works was reorganized several times under various names. In 1849, it was called Hobbs, Barnes & Company. In 1856 the name was changed to Barnes, Hobbs & Company. In 1857, it became Hobbs & Barnes. In 1863, it was named J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier & Company. In 1881, the name became Hobbs, Brockunier & Company. See \\"Glass ‚Äì South Wheeling Glass Works\\" web site. Glass had been made in Wheeling as early as 1821, and there were three \\"glass houses\\" by 1886.See page 8 of Bredehoft's \\"Hobbs, Brockunier & Co. Glass: Identification and Value Guide\\". See also the \\"Glass ‚Äì South Wheeling Glass Works\\" and \\"Glass ‚Äì The Glass Houses\\" web sites for history on Wheeling's first glass factories and the Hobbs, Brockunier & Company. The Hobbs plant had a transportation advantage because it was located very close to the Ohio River. Henry Crimmel's brother Jacob also worked at the Hobbs plant,On page 174 of Venable's China and glass in America, Henry and Jacob Crimmel are mentioned having previously worked at the Belmont Glass Company and Hobbs, Brockunier & Company. and there is a high probability that older brother John also worked at the same plant‚Äîsimply because there were not many alternatives at the time. Many years later, one of Jacob Crimmel's American Flint magazine articles described working for the Hobbs Glass Works in 1861, meaning that he was about 13 years old when he starting working there.See Jake Crimmel's \\"Early Life in the Glass Industry\\" in the May 1924 edition of the American Flint. In the 1860s, duties for youngsters just getting started at glass works often involved adding coal and/or wood to furnaces. Bellaire-Wheeling 1873After the war, Henry Crimmel and family members lived in Bellaire, Ohio.All three Crimmel brothers are listed by the 1870 U.S. Census as glassblowers living in different locations in Bellaire, Ohio. Bellaire, Ohio became known as \\"Glass City\\" during the period of 1870 to 1885 because of the number of glass factories in the area.See page 170 of McKelvey's Centennial History of Belmont County.Data from the 1880 U.S. Census confirms that Henry Crimmel, with a wife and three children, lived in Bellaire at that time. The first glass factory in Bellaire was the Belmont Glass Company (a.k.a. Belmont Glass Works), and some of the Belmont's founders were former employees of the Hobbs works in Wheeling ‚Äì including Civil War veteran John Robinson. Both Henry and Jacob Crimmel worked at the Belmont Glass works, and Henry was a manager. Older brother and Bellaire resident John Crimmel is also believed to have worked at that works. The plant began as a maker of chimneys, but changed to a maker of pressed glassware. Some of the well known glassmakers of the West Virginia-Ohio-Indiana area worked there before they gained their fame.See page 174 of Venable's \\"China and glass in America\\", and see also Jake Crimmel's \\"Early Life in the Glass Industry\\". Eventually, the Belmont factory closed in 1890 after an economic recession. Natural gas was discovered in 1887 in the Findley-Tiffin-Fostoria area of Ohio, and this caused many of the glass houses elsewhere to relocate to be near this low-cost resource. The Fostoria Glass Company started in December 1887, and both Henry and Jacob Crimmel were considered important craftsmen in its early years.See page 174 of Venable's China and glass in America. Crimmel recipes for various colors of glass are thought to have been used in the early days of this glass works. Several Crimmel family members were involved in the startup of this plant, and Crimmels were also stockholders. Although Jacob Crimmel would remain with Fostoria Glass through its eventual move to West Virginia, Henry Crimmel became involved with Novelty Glass Company of Fostoria.See page 144 of Lechner's World of Salt Shakers III. Pages 144 and 145 also discuss the opening and closing of the plant, and show some of the company's products. Novelty was located on the original Fostoria site for the Buttler Art Glass Company, which was destroyed by fire in 1889. Henry Crimmel and his son, A. C. Crimmel were among a group of six listed as the \\"incorporators\\". Henry Crimmel was the plant manager, while son A. C. Crimmel was the new company's secretary.The incorporators were Rawson Crocker, A.C. Crimmel, Charles Olmsted, C. German, A. Emerine, George Flechtner, and Henry Crimmel. Crocker, a cousin of former Ohio Governor George Foster, was the President. See Murray's \\"History of Fostoria, Ohio glass 1887-1920\\", pages 10 and 11. The works opened in early 1891, making items such as figurine salt shakers, punch bowls, cups, and other blown-ware. Glass bottles were also one of the plant's products, and in 1892 Henry received a patent for a bottle and stopper combination that could be resealed but not refilled.United States Patent Office No. 482,230, patented September 6, 1892. The patent describes him as living in Fostoria, Ohio. The original Novelty Glass Company was short-lived: it became part of the U.S. Glass Company (as Factory T) in mid-1892, and was destroyed by fire in 1893. Glassmaking ‚Äì the later years Lantern made by Sneath Glass CompanyShortly after the closing of the Novelty Glass Company, Henry Crimmel joined the Sneath Glass Company in Tiffin, Ohio, as plant manager. The Tiffin plant burnt down, but was reorganized using insurance money and a subsidy from a community in Indiana. The new version of the Sneath Glass Company was led by Henry Crimmel and Ralph Sneath.Mr. Ralph Sneath, of Tiffin, Ohio, was the capitalist of the group, while Henry Crimmel supplied the glassmaking expertise. The Sneath family had many business interests in the Tiffin area, including grain and railroading. Eventually, the family also became involved in banking. Similar to the transformation of Fostoria after the discovery of natural gas in the area, the Indiana Gas Boom in east central Indiana caused many factories to move to Indiana. Sneath Glass relocated to Hartford City, Indiana in 1894, and Henry Crimmel was manager of the new plant. He was also part owner and a member of the company's board of directors.See Sneath Glass Company section in Hartford City Illustrated. Mr. Crimmel had about 30 years of experience by then, and he applied his glass- making skills toward making his employees more efficient. Glassblowers at the Sneath plant were aided by a unique system of air hoses that enabled them to be more productive. Henry Crimmel also received another patent in 1904 for a \\"Glass Drawing Machine\\" that was an improvement for glass blowing and prevented irregularities in the glass.United States Patent Office No. 759,159, patented May 3, 1904 The Sneath Glass plant made lantern globes and founts during its early years. During the 1905 to 1915 period, the company began to put less emphasis on lantern-related blown-ware, and more production involved glass canisters for portable kitchen cabinets. By 1910, the factory employed about 150 people.The Indiana Department of Inspection lists the plant as employing 129 males, 30 females, 10 boys age 14 to 16, and 1 girl age 14 to 16. Glassmaking was a family business for the Crimmels. Brothers John, Henry, and Jacob Crimmel were glassmakers, and at times two or more of them worked at the same plant. One of Henry Crimmel's sons was a partner with his father in the Sneath Glass Company, and two grandsons also worked at the Sneath plant and eventually became part of management. Three of Henry Crimmel's great- grandsons eventually spent time at the plant long after Henry Crimmel's death, and a great-great grandson worked briefly at Indiana Glass Company. Both John and Jacob Crimmel also had children that worked in the glass business.Henry Crimmel's second son, Alva (a.k.a. Alvie) Clyde Crimmel, was a co-founder of Sneath Glass Company along with Henry Crimmel, Ralph Davis Sneath, and J.W. Geiger. Alvie Clyde's two sons, Henry Hays Crimmel and John Richard Crimmel eventually became part of Sneath Glass management. All three of Henry Hays Crimmel's sons also worked part time at the Sneath Glass plant, and a grandson worked briefly at Indiana Glass Company. See The Glass Business and the Crimmels and The Sneath Glass I Remember, by A. Clyde Crimmel (II). Census records from 1900 indicate that the sons of John and Jacob Crimmel were involved in the glass business as mould makers in West Virginia. In 1916, Henry Crimmel suffered a stroke, and was forced to completely retire. Although he recovered enough to take walks around town, he also had heart trouble. On October 10, 1917, he died from heart failure.See obituary \\"H. Crimmel Drops Dead on Street\\".

The seventh named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, Maria formed out of a tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. On August 5, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the depression as a tropical storm while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) kept it as a depression. The storm quickly strengthened into a typhoon the next day, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 130 km/h (80 mph 10-minute winds) early on August 6\\\\. The storm gradually weakened as it began to recurve, causing it to parallel the southeastern coast of Japan. On August 9, Maria weakened into a tropical depression and later into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating on August 15\\\\. Maria had only minor effects in Japan, mainly heavy rains which were estimated to have peaked over 400 mm (15.7 in) on the Izu Peninsula. One person was killed after being struck by lightning and six others were injured. Meteorological history On August 3, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring a tropical depression located to the southeast of Minami Torishima Island. The depression slowly developed as it moved towards the west-northwest. At 1630 UTC on August 5, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the developing system while it was located about 740 km (460 mi) east-northeast of the northern Mariana Islands. Deep convection was present around the center of circulation but the overall structure of the storm resembled a subtropical cyclone. However, the storm was likely to intensify as it was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear with favorable diffulence aloft. Later that day, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Maria; a name submitted by the United States and a common Chamorro feminine name. Maria continued towards the west- northwest along the edge of a broad subtropical ridge located east of Japan. As the JMA issued their first advisory, the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 09W while located about 280 km (175 mi) east-northeast of Iwo Jima. Early the next day, the JMA classified Maria as a severe tropical storm with winds of 95 km/h (60 mph 10-minute winds) while the JTWC reported that Maria had just become a tropical storm with winds reaching 75 km/h (45 mph 1-minute winds). The storm also had a slight northward relocation. Tracking towards the northwest, the storm intensified into a typhoon and reached its peak intensity with winds of 130 km/h (80 mph 10-minute winds) and minimum pressure of 975 hPa (mbar) at 0900 UTC. Around the same time, the JTWC assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 110 km/h (70 mph 1-minute winds). However, the JTWC operationally classified Maria as a minimal typhoon with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph 1-minute winds) on August 7. TRMM satellite image of Maria on August 7 On August 7, a banding eye feature developed with deep convection around the eastern portion of the storm. Later that day, the storm sharply recurved towards the northeast and paralleled the southern coastline of Honshu. As Maria made the turn, dry air began to enter the system, causing it to weaken. Along with the dry air, wind shear began to increase and the JMA downgraded Maria to a severe tropical storm early on August 8. The storm continued to weaken as it came very close to landfall near Tokyo, Japan on August 9. Both agencies downgraded Maria to a tropical depression early on August 9, with the JTWC issuing their final advisory at that time. Maria remained a tropical depression for another 24 hours before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August 10 while located about 835 km (520 mi) east-northeast of Tokyo. The extratropical remnants turned towards the north and dissipated late on August 14 over the Sea of Okhotsk. Preparations and impact Weather officials warned residents about heavy rains, strong winds, and high waves in the T≈çkai region, Kant≈ç region, K≈çshin'etsu region, and the Izu Islands between August 8 and 9. Seven flights out of Tokyo at Haneda airport were cancelled due to Maria. The JR Ito Line, an express train line, was temporarily shut down as a result of rain. As Maria brushed Japan, it produced heavy rains over the southeastern areas of the country. Yokota Air Base recorded 38.1 mm (1.5 in) of rainfall and winds up to 34 km/h (21 mph). Parts of the Izu Peninsula recorded rainfall in excess of 400 mm (15.7 in) over a two-day span, peaking at in Tokyo. In Gifu Prefecture, thunderstorms associated with the typhoon resulted in a landslide that knocked out power to 510 residences. One man was injured and two cows died after a small farm was severely damaged by high winds. Flooding and landslides affected dozens of homes in Ch≈çshi, Chiba, prompting the evacuation of 63 families. One person was killed in Tokyo after being struck by lightning. Five people were injured when a plane headed for Tokyo encountered turbulence produced by Maria.

Medical books  Stauth's first book, 1981's The New Approach to Cancer, was one of the earliest to describe integrative therapies for cancer patients, and was among the first to present a comprehensive lifestyle program for cancer prevention.

The plant remains endangered due to destruction of habitat and browsing by deer. The severe Texas drought of the 1950s may have contributed to its decline. Big red sage was thought to be extinct beginning around 1946, until it was rediscovered by botanist Marshall Enquist in 1980 while shooting pictures for his Wildflowers of the Texas Hill Country. At first, Enquist didn't realize he had taken a photo of an 'extinct' plant. He identified it as Salvia pentstemonoides from a guide book which didn't state that the plant was considered extinct. Wildflowers of the Texas Hill Country was finally published in 1987, without S. pentstemonoides. That year, Enquist began thinking about adding some more wildflowers‚Äîincluding S. pentstemonoides‚Äîto a second edition. While inquiring about the plant, he was surprised to learn that it had been considered extinct for many years. In 1988, Enquist received the Donovan Stewart Correll Memorial Award from the Native Plant Society of Texas for his rediscovery of Salvia pentstemonoides. History and taxonomy The first written account of the plant was in 1845, when it was collected by botanist Ferdinand Lindheimer, who sent a sample to botanist George Engelmann. Engelmann sent it to Carl Sigismund Kunth and Peter Karl Bouch√© in Germany, who first published and named the plant in 1848. It was also documented growing along Salado Creek in San Antonio in 1849. The specific epithet pentstemonoides is frequently misspelled as \\"penstemonoides\\". The plant was originally named after an early spelling of Penstemon by Carl Linnaeus that added an extra \\"t\\". Since it was first described and named as \\"pentstemonoides\\", that spelling is considered the correct one. As the name suggests, the plant resembles penstemon.IPNI listing Description Salvia pentstemonoides typically grows in limestone rock along seeps or creeks, reaching up to 5 feet tall with square stems, often with long basal leaves in addition to opposite cauline leaves. The leaves are mistletoe-green colored, lancelike in shape, growing in a basal rosette. Numerous flowering stalks grow from the rosette, with inflorescences that are 8‚Äì12 inches long, having whorls of loosely packed flowers. The 1 inch flowers are beetroot-purple colored, with a .5 inch calyx that is the color of red wine. The flowers are edible, and the leaves give off a lemon-lime scent when brushed or rubbed. In cultivation, Salvia pentstemonoides likes fast-draining soil with limestone or ground oystershells added. It prefers morning sun with high shade, but grows well in full sun in areas of high humidity. Deep weekly watering is also preferred. The plant is hardy to about and easily propagated by seed; propagation through cuttings is possible and clumps can be divided provided it's done with care. It is very attractive to hummingbirds.

Family and early life Sophia FitzClarence was born in August 1796 on Somerset Street in London, the eldest daughter of Prince William, Duke of Clarence, by his longtime mistress, the comic actress Dorothea Jordan. Sophia would come to have nine siblings, five brothers and four sisters all surnamed FitzClarence. While circumstances prevented the couple from ever marrying, for twenty years William and Dorothea enjoyed domestic stability and were devoted to their children. In 1797, they moved from Clarence Lodge to Bushy House, residing at the Teddington residence until 1807. The couple separated in 1811 as William sought to produce legitimate issue. Marriage and issue On 13 August 1825, she married Philip Sidney, later an M.P. and the 1st Baron De L'Isle and Dudley of Penshurst in the County of Kent. Sidney was a relation of the Romantic poet and philosopher Percy Bysshe Shelley, though he opted to drop \\"Shelley\\" from his surname. Sophia and her husband had four surviving children, three daughters and a son: * Adelaide Augusta Willhelmina Sydney, married her first cousin, Frederick Charles George FitzClarence-Hunloke, son of George FitzClarence, 1st Earl of Munster, no issue * Ernestine Wellington Sidney, married Philip Perceval; mother of Major Sir Philip Hunloke, who was the father of Lt.-Col. Henry Philip Hunloke * Sophia Philippa Sidney, married Alexander, Graf von Kielmannsegg, a great-grandson of Johann Ludwig, Reichsgraf von Wallmoden- Gimborn (illegitimate son of George II of Great Britain) * Philip Sidney, 2nd Baron of De L'Isle and Dudley of Penshurst (1828‚Äì1898), grandfather of the 1st Viscount De L'Isle Later life William IV drawn by his daughter Sophia in 1837 In May 1831 Sophia, like her sisters, was raised to the status of a daughter of a marquess. In January 1837, she was appointed State Housekeeper of Kensington Palace, where she died three months later. Sophia died in childbirth just after drawing a sketch of her ailing father. She was his favourite child and her death caused him intense grief. She was remembered as a woman of great wit, charm and gaiety. There is a memorial to her at St John the Baptist, Penshurst. The widowed Sidney died in 1851.

The lake and the surrounding area of pristine land hosts an abundance of wildlife, exotic aquatic life (including freshwater jellyfish) and one of the largest Douglas fir trees in the Greater Victoria area. For over a century the lake and surrounding lands have been owned by a single extended family, which developed the property minimally. The first dwelling, an 1860s hunting cabin turned farm house, still stands. Motorized watercraft have been banned by the family since the '50s; the lake provides a potable drinking water source for the few residents there. As land taxes continue to rise (in the order of 500x in the last 40 years), the owners endeavour to maintain this idyllic setting. Maltby Lake is the most important water body in the Tod Creek Watershed and possibly on the entire Saanich Peninsula.

The artificial grass is used in the summertime for soccer and American football. It is located close to the Frogner Park, between the park and Majorstuen. One match, Norway-Belarus, was played here at the 2013 Bandy World Championship.worldbandy.com History It opened in 1901, and was built by the speed skating club Kristiania Sk√∏iteklub. In 1914, the stadium was moved to its current position, due to the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition. At the inaugural race in 1914, two speed skating world records were set by Oscar Mathisen, in 500 m and 1,500 m. In 1928, Oslo Municipality took over responsibility for the stadium. Frogner stadion was one of the most important ice skating venues in Norway until 1940. A long series of championships were held at Frogner stadion, both in figure skating and in speed skating. A total of 23 speed skating world records have been set at the stadium (including some not officially listed). Seventeen of the records from Frogner are listed among the official ISU world records in speed skating. Outside the stadium are statues of Oscar Mathisen and Sonja Henie. Frogner stadion has been the venue for international matches both in football and bandy, as well as international track and field athletics competitions. The venue hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships in 1906, 1911, 1912, 1914, 1917, 1918, 1920, 1922 and 1924. After the rebuild in 2010 it also became the homefield of the Oslo Vikings American football, currently the second best team in Norway. Speed skating world records at Frogner stadion Men's records ;World records at the old stadium (before 1914) In 1911, Nikolay Strunnikov skated the 5,000 m distance in a world record time of 8:37.2. This record was originally not approved by ISU, but is now listed among the world records. Oscar Mathisen set two records on 17 and 18 February 1912. The 500 m time was 44.2, while the 10,000 m record was 17:46.3. He improved his own record twice in 1913, first in Trondhjem and later at Frogner, and the new record was 17:22.6. ;World records at the new stadium from 1914 Oscar Mathisen set two world records at the opening of the new stadium on 10 January 1914. The time was 43.7 over 500 m and 2:19.4 over 1,500 m. In 1916, Oscar Mathisen set a world record over 5,000 m, with the time 8:36.3. In 1921, Harald Str√∏m set the record 8:27.7, and in 1922 he improved his own record to 8:26.5, both at Frogner stadion. Str√∏m's 5,000 m record from 1922 lasted seven years, the longest lasting of all world records set at Frogner, until it was beaten by Ivar Ballangrud in Davos in 1929. In 1932, Clas Thunberg skated the 1,000 m distance in 1:27.4, better than the world record, but this time is not registered as an official record. In 1936, Allan Potts set a world record over 500 m, with the time 42.4, improving on Hans Engnestangen's time from Davos three years earlier. This record lasted only 12 days, when Engnestangen set another world record in Davos. Ivar Ballangrud set a world record at Frogner over 5,000 m in 1936, with the time 8:17.2, and this record lasted five years. Women's records Several records from Frogner stadion from the 1930s are not listed as official world records. Those that are listed are Synn√∏ve Lie's 50.3 over 500 m in 1934, and Laila Schou Nilsen's 49.3 in 1935. Vern√© Lesche set a world record over 1,000 m in 1934, with 1:45.7. For the 1,500 m distance, three world records set at Frogner stadium are listed: Synn√∏ve Lie's 3:08.1 in 1932, Undis Blikken's 2:40.0 in 1934, and Laila Schou Nilsen's 2:38.1 in 1937.

Hale Carpenter MBE (26 October 1882 in Eton, Berkshire ‚Äì 30 January 1953 in Oxford) was a British entomologist and medical doctor. He worked first at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and in Uganda, on tse-tse flies and sleeping sickness. His main work in zoology was on mimicry in butterflies, an interest he developed in Uganda and Tanganyika. He succeeded E.B. Poulton as Hope Professor of Zoology at Oxford University from 1933‚Äì1948.Remington, Charles L. (1954). \\"Geoffrey Douglas Hale Carpenter\\". Lepidopterist's News 8: 31-43. Biography Douglas was a son of Philip Herbert Carpenter DSc FRS, a schoolmaster at Eton College; a grandson of the naturalist and physiologist William Benjamin Carpenter; and a great-grandson of Lant Carpenter, a Unitarian minister. Carpenter attended St Catherine's College, Oxford, graduating in 1904. He studied medicine at St George's Hospital, London, graduating as a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (the standard combined medical degree at the University of London at that time) in 1908. He then joined the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and became a Doctor of Medicine in 1913 with a dissertation on the tsetse fly (Glossina palpalis) and sleeping sickness. In 1919 he married Amy Frances Thomas-Peter from Cornwall. The marriage had no issue. Career In 1910 he joined the Colonial Medical Service, where he worked in Uganda on the north shore of Lake Victoria. Upon the outbreak of World War I, Carpenter was called to service in the British Army Medical Corps. He was stationed with the troops at the border between Uganda and German East Africa. In December 1914 he was appointed Medical Officer at the fort in Kakindu, southern Uganda. As it turned out, he had plenty of spare time, and spent it studying the local butterflies. \\"The hosts of butterflies at Kakindu passed beyond anything I had ever see; some days are quite unforgettable\\".Carpenter, G.D.H. (1925). A Naturalist in East Africa. p. 23. From May 1916 to January 1918, he worked in Tanganyika (former German E. Africa), 200 miles south to south-east of Lake Victoria. Here he conducted experiments on palatability with young insectivorous monkeys. He tested the edibility of cryptic and aposematic insects. This was propitious, because later, back at Oxford, both he and E.B. Poulton worked on the role of predators in shaping mimicry. The standard theory was that cryptic forms were palatable, and aposematic forms were distasteful, implying that palatable mimics of distasteful forms could gain protection from predation. The question at stake was whether the observations, which dated from work by naturalists in the 19th century, could be accounted for by natural selection. Mimicry In England the geneticist R.C. Punnett, and in America the ornithologist W.L. McAtee, doubted both that birds could distinguish distasteful forms, and that their predation was heavy enough to bring about the colour forms found in butterflies. Punnett's 1915 Mimicry in butterflies rejected selection as the main cause of mimicry. He noted: :1. The absence of transitional forms and the frequent lack of mimicry in male butterflies were unexplained by selectionist theory. :2. The enigma of polymorphic mimicry. Some species of butterfly mimicked not merely one, but several models. In breeding experiments these polymorphs cleanly segregated according to Mendel‚Äôs law of segregation. :3. Evidence of birds as selective agents was slight and little was known of birds' discriminatory powers, and :4. The gradual accumulation of minute variations did not fit with the facts of heredity. For Punnett, none of these observations were explained by gradual selectionism. Instead he thought mimicry had arisen from sudden mutational jumps (saltations). Once a mimic was formed by mutation, natural selection might play a conservative role. However, one by one, each of these objections were shown to be without substance. Evidence from field observations and experiments showed that birds were often the agents of selection in insects.Carpenter, G.D.H.; Ford, E.B. (1933). Mimicry. London: Methuen.Brower, L.P. (1988). Mimicry and the Evolutionary Process. Chicago.Endler, J.A. (1986). Natural Selection in the Wild. Princeton. Evidence that small-scale mutations were common arrived as soon as breeding experiments were designed to detect them: it was a consequence of experimental methods that early mutations were so noteworthy. Explanations for polymorphism were advanced by E.B. Ford and Dobzhansky and colleagues, who developed experimental methods for populations in the wild.Ford, E.B. (1975). Ecological Genetics, Fourth edition. London: Chapman and Hall.Dobzhansky, Theodosius (1970). Genetics of the Evolutionary Process. New York: Columbia University Press. The question of polymorphism is discussed further in polymorphism (biology). The gradual coming-together of field observations and experimental genetics is part of the evolutionary synthesis which took place in the middle of the twentieth century.Huxley, J.S. (1942). Evolution: the Modern Synthesis. Allen and Unwin. The small 1933 book on mimicry by Carpenter and E.B. Ford was the first book on ecological genetics, a field which produced a series of classic studies uniting fieldwork with laboratory genetics. The book is a minor masterpiece of evolutionary biology.

Its name stems from the neighbourhood Frogner, a name which was taken from a farm. It was formerly known, with Bestumkilen, under the name of Ladegaardsfjordene. This stems from older times, when Bygd√∏y was an island, named Ladegaards√∏en. Bygd√∏y later became a peninsula due to post-glacial rebound, separating Bestumkilen from Frognerkilen. Propositions to reconnect Bestumkilen and Frognerkilen through a canal were made in 1928 and 1937, but not carried out. It was an important shipping port for timber in the 17th and 18th centuries, but today a large part of the bay is used as a harbour for leisure boats. During the winter, Frognerkilen was used as a venue for harness racing--from 1875 to the 1920s--as well as speed skating in the pioneer days before 1900. A skating competition between Axel Paulsen and Renke van der Zee from the Netherlands on Frognerkilen in 1885, when van der Zee challenged Paulsen for his title \\"amateur champion of the world\\", attracted approximately 30,000 spectators. Kristiania Sk√∏iteklub had Frognerkilen as its competition arena until Frogner stadion was opened in 1901. Frognerkilen was also a popular site of boat sports. The rowing club Christiania RK had its headquarters at the mainland, in a locality known as \\"Kongen\\" ('The King'), whereas the Royal Norwegian Yacht Club had its headquarters at the opposite shore of Frognerkilen, in a locality known as \\"Dronningen\\" ('The Queen'). Frognerkilen was formerly trafficked by ferry; one ferry sailed between the railway station at Skarpsno and Oscarshall at Bygd√∏y, and the other sailed between Skillebekk and Kongen. Also, Frognerkilen was probably the site where Fiskerlivets farer, depicting perils at sea, was filmed. Released in 1908, it is considered to be the Norwegian drama film.

Early life and education Lynne Drexler was born and raised in the Newport News, Virginia area. Her parents were Lynne P. and Norman E. Drexler, who was a manager at a public utility. At the age of 11 she was an only child and had been living in Raleigh Terrace, Elizabeth City (now Hampton), Virginia.1930 Census for Wythe, Elizabeth City, Virginia; Roll: 2442; Page: 30B; Enumeration District: 0019; Image: 381.0; FHL microfilm: 2342176.

Later, Drexler took art classes in Virginia at the Richmond Professional Institute and at the College of William and Mary. She moved to New York City in the mid to late 1950s to further her study art under Robert Motherwell at Hunter College and Hans Hofmann, under their tutelage she developed an interest in Abstract Expressionism.Paintings by Maine artist Lynne Drexler on view at the Portland Museum of Art . Portlandmuseum.org. August 1, 2008. Retrieved on February 2, 2014. Motherwell taught her composition and draftsmanship techniques and the philosophy \\"that to be an artist meant first and foremost that one had to create work worthy of attention\\". Her tendency to create vibrant paintings using a free brush stroke was influenced by Hofman and the work of Henri Matisse. Hofman also introduced the notion that composition is influenced by color, which he called the \\"push- pull\\" concept. Adulthood Cosmopolitan life In the late 1950s she was an abstract expressionist and was \\"counted among an important group of women artists whose figural and landscape works were often overlooked during the heyday of post-abstract expressionist modernism ‚Äì artists such as Jane Freilicher, Lois Dodd, and Jane Wilson.\\" She was a devotee of classical music, attending up to 3 opera performances each week, and would often go to opera and symphony performances with a sketchpad and colored crayons in hand to make sketches inspired by the music. Drexler's Pattern and Decoration embroidery and patchwork influenced some of her later works, similar designs often appeared in her painting's backgrounds. In 1961 Drexler met fellow artist John Hultberg at The Artist's Club in New York. Artists there discussed abstract expressionism and it was there she met accomplished artists. Through their connections she had her first solo exhibition of 11 works at Tanager Gallery. Drexler and Hultberg were married and for three years traveled and lived in Mexico, the West Coast and Hawaii. They then lived at New York's Chelsea Hotel in the late 1960s.Lynne Drexler biography.

For six months, Drexler had a case of colorblindness and developed a severe case of depression. Monhegan Island Seeking a relaxing environment, the couple bought a house off the coast of Maine on Monhegan Island in 1971 and split their time between New York City and Maine, particularly spending the summers at their island house. By 1983, Drexler moved year-around and permanently near Lighthouse Hill on Monhegan Island, an artists' haven off the coast of Maine, where she had spent most summers since 1963. The island people and landscape were the subject of many of her paintings from that time.‚ÄúLynne Drexler: Painter‚Äù at the Monhegan Museum. Workingwaterfront.com.

Drexler's paintings became less strictly abstract and exhibited a synthesis of abstract and representational influences. Drexler died December 30, 1999, living two years longer than expected battling cancer.

His most famous work is his Portrait of a Man in a Black Cap. His son John Bettes the Younger, with whom he is sometimes confused, was a pupil of Nicholas Hilliard who painted portraits during the reign of Elizabeth I and James I.Karen Hearn, Dynasties: Painting in Tudor and Jacobean England, 1530‚Äì1630, London: Tate Publishing, 1995, , 47. John Bettes the Younger died in 1616. Man in a Black Cap, 1545. Nothing is known of John Bettes's life, except that he was living in Westminster in 1556, according to a documented court case.Karen Hearn, Dynasties: Painting in Tudor and Jacobean England, 1530‚Äì1630, London: Tate Publishing, 1995, , 46‚Äì47. He is first recorded as working for Henry VIII at Whitehall Palace in 1531. Queen Catherine Parr's accounts for 1546/47 record payments to Bettes for \\"lymning\\" (painting in miniature) the king's and queen's portraits, and for six other portraits. Her new year's gift of 1547 to Prince Edward was a pair of portraits of the king and herself.Strype, John, Ecclesiastical Memorials, vol 2, part 2, Oxford (1822), 512, Edward to Katharine, 10 January 1546/7. Bettes has been identified as the designer of the engraved title-border for William Cuningham's Cosmographical Glasse, printed by John Day in 1559. He may also be the designer of engravings for Edward Hall's Chronicle, published in 1550, and of a woodcut portrait of Franz Burchard, the Saxon ambassador to England, published in 1560. In 1576, John Foxe referred to Bettes as already dead.Roy Strong, The English Icon: Elizabethan & Jacobean Portraiture, London: Paul Mellon Foundation, 1969, 65‚Äì67. An earlier second edition of Foxe's Actes and Monuments printed in 1570 refers to Bettes' death.Edmond, Mary, 'Limners & Picturemakers', 47th Annual volume of the Walpole Society, London, (1980), 67. The identification of John Bettes's work stems from the inscription on the back of Man in a Black Cap: \\"faict par Johan Bettes Anglois\\" (\\"done by John Bettes, Englishman\\").Ellis Waterhouse, Painting in Britain: 1530‚Äì1790, London: Penguin, 1978, , 23. The painting is dated 1545 on the front. On the basis of its style, four further portraits have been attributed to Bettes: two of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Baron Wentworth, (1549); one of Sir William Butts the Younger (154/3?); and one of Sir William Cavendish (c. 1545). Style Man in a Black Cap's technique is reminiscent of Hans Holbein the Younger's, suggesting that Bettes may have worked with Holbein as part of his workshop. Nothing, however, is known of Holbein's workshop other than paintings seemingly associated with it. Holbein does not appear to have founded a school, and Bettes is the only artist whose work reveals his technical influence. For example, he paints over a pink priming, as did Holbein. According to art historian Roy Strong, \\"He is the artist who, on grounds of style, has the best claim to have worked under Holbein\\". On the other hand, Bettes's style is distinct from Holbein's; he paints fur more loosely and the beard more flatly than the German artist.Susan Foister, Holbein in England, London: Tate, 2006, , 116. In the view of art historian Susan Foister, on the evidence of this portrait, Bettes is \\"unlikely to have assisted\\" Holbein. The recording of an artist's name on a painting is rare in this period. The addition of Bettes' nationality suggests that Man in a Black Cap may have been painted abroad. Since the work's creation, the blue smalt pigment of the background has turned brown; the painting has also been cut down along the sides and bottom, with the inscription reaffixed to the back. It has been speculated that the portrait may be of Edmund Butts, the brother of the William Butts whom Bettes painted. Both were sons of William Butts, a court physician whose portrait Holbein painted in 1543.

In 1909‚Äì1914, he won several championships as a sprinter and hurdler, and later became a handball player. Early years J. Ira Courtney was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. According to Jim Daves, the author of The Glory of Washington (his book about the University of Washington), it was there that young Ira first discovered his talent for sprinting when he and his brother outran some policemen when they were caught filching fruit in an orchard. After moving with his family to Seattle, Washington, Courtney competed on the Broadway High School track team. In 1909, he was the captain of Washington‚Äôs West Side Team in the state championship meet, where he won the low hurdles, and all three sprinting events, setting a new state record in the 220-yard dash of 22 and one-fifth of a second. (This was in the days long before modern technology which now allows races to be recorded in one hundredths of a second.) He also competed on Broadway‚Äôs swimming, baseball, and football teams. Courtney's victory in the 220-yard low hurdles on May 1, 1909, was the decisive race in Broadway's one-point victory over cross-town rival Lincoln High School. Later that year, he competed in track events for the Seattle Athletic Club. College career In 1910, Courtney attended the Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, where he equaled the interscholastic record in the 40-yard dash of 4 and 3/5 of a second while competing on a wooden track at the snow-bound college. In 1911, Courtney returned to Seattle and enrolled at the University of Washington where his sprinting speed continued to improve. After a number of impressive victories in the spring of 1912, a growing movement of Courtney‚Äôs Seattle fans persuaded the Seattle Athletic Club to send him to the west coast Olympic trials that May in California. During the trials on May 17 at Stanford University's track in Palo Alto, Courtney qualified for the Olympic team by winning the 100-meter dash, tying the then world Olympic record of 10.4 seconds which was set in 1908 by the South African sprinter Reggie Walker during the games in London. During the Olympic trials Courtney also won the 200-meter dash. By qualifying, Courtney became both the University of Washington's first Olympic athlete, and the first Olympic athlete from the Pacific Northwest. 1912 Olympic Games At the Games, Courtney won both of his heats, but was eliminated in the semi- finals of the 100 m and 200 m events. Courtney was selected for the 4√ó100 meter relay and would almost certainly have won a gold medal in that race if the U.S. team had not been eliminated in a semi-final after two other members faulted the baton pass. It was the first and only time the United States team failed to win the 4 √ó 100 m relay until 1960, when they were eliminated for the same reason. Courtney also played on the U.S. team in the baseball demonstration event. Among his teammates, was Abel Kiviat, who was the silver medalist in the 1500 meters, and would go on to become America's longest- living Olympic medal-winner. He died in 1991 at the age of 99. Post-Olympic career In 1913, Courtney enrolled at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he earned a law degree and continued running track. However, his shot at making another Olympic team in 1916 was dashed when the games were cancelled because of an event called World War I. In the 1920s he went on to win a number of Southern California doubles handball championships with his partner Fred Alney. Family In 1918, Courtney married Pauline Regina Hollingsworth, whose brother Jim was the Ventura County district attorney for many years. Pauline would later become a prolific and award- winning painter, one of whose works, depicting the forging area at the Fontana Kaiser Steel Mill, hung in the Library of Congress. After practicing law for a short time, Courtney became a partner in an engineering contracting business that specialized in road building. Among their many projects was the highway from Barstow to Baker. During the depression the partnership dissolved, and Courtney again practiced law for a few more years. Then, except for two periods when he was the San Diego County Rent Attorney and worked for the State Pest Control registrar, Courtney was employed with the California Contractors' State License Board from 1940 to 1959. On May 1, 1959, Courtney returned to the practice of law when he entered into partnership with his son Norman P. Courtney in Fontana, California. In February 1968, he and Pauline celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary with a large gathering of their family and friends in the home of their daughter Shirley, whose husband Elsworth Beam was a superior court judge for 20 years. Also in attendance that day was their other son, Southern (named in tribute to the University of Southern California), who was a high school social studies teacher for many years. Death On the morning of April 1, 1968, after he'd gone to open up the law office in downtown Fontana, Courtney thought he smelled gas, and attempted to air out the building. Unfortunately, some source (most likely a spark when he flipped on a light switch) ignited the gas, and the office was rocked by a violent explosion, which blew out windows and buckled several walls. Legal papers were singed and Courtney was buffeted about the room. After emerging from the office (with his necktie still ablaze), people from an adjacent building helped snuff out his burning clothes and called paramedics. His scalp, face, neck, chest, and hands were badly burned. Courtney was taken to Fontana's Kaiser Foundation Hospital, where he died of pneumonia on April 15, due to complications and infections from his burns. Ironically, Courtney had saved a young neighbor girl from similar severe injuries at a Fourth of July party in the 1920s, when her frilly ballet dress was set on fire by another girl when she accidentally touched a lit sparkler to the flammable material in her friend‚Äôs dress during a dance presentation in his neighbor‚Äôs backyard. Hearing her screams, Courtney hurdled a hedge between the properties, chased down the panicked girl, and then wrapped her face and upper body with his coat, thereby sparing her from a lifetime of facial scars. J. Ira Courtney is buried in the Rialto Park Cemetery in Rialto, California.

The original road plan had it running through Cawston and not around it but the extra funding was quickly found to change this. In September 2002 Rugby Borough Council had finalised and submitted their plans which were accepted in October that year.A summary of the scheme from Warwickshire County Council In December 2005 the Department for Transport approved Compulsory Purchase and Side Roads Orders, albeit with slight modifications to the plan regarding the extreme southern end of the road.Approval letter from the Department The construction company Carillion, who have also worked on the M6 toll and the 2009 M6 extension, were awarded the contract.A Greyhound Plant Ltd, suppliers to Carillion, newsletter Special consideration has been taken to reduce the environmental impact of the new road.

From there it skirts the western side of the town, crossing the A428 in New Bilton before cutting through the north of the town to join the A426 which in turn joins the M6 motorway just north of the town.Detailed plans for the route from Warwickshire County Council Work was begun in August 2007, nearly ten years after public consultation began. After months of building temporary service routes, major earthworking started in May 2008 along the southern section of the road. By the start of September that year tarmac was starting to be laid on this section and earthworking was starting elsewhere.Details of work on the bypass during 2008 For the rest of the year the roundabout at the south end of the road, along with strengthening of existing bridges started. In January 2009 industrial contaminants were found on a part of the proposed route on land formerly owned by Cemex, one of whose plants are next to the road. These however were quickly identified and removed.Details of work on the bypass during 2009 In March 2009 a roundabout was completed on the A4071 which will take drivers off it and onto the Relief Road. During construction local school children and interested members of the public were able to have planned visits to the site.Details of one such visit by school children on the Carillion website In July 2009 the bridge that took the Lawford Road over the disused railway was taken down and the Lawford Road was diverted to make way for what became the largest signalised junction in Warwickshire. In November 2009 the southern section from the A4071 to the Lawford Road was waiting to be topped off. Further north up the route the earthworks were been completed.Progress of work in the second half of 2009 On 19 June 2010 the southern section of the road from Potford's Dam to Lawford Road opened to traffic. This was preceded by a charity open day of the route allowing local people to explore the route in safety. The remainder of the route was opened on 10 September 2010. Effects of road A study was carried out in September 2011 by Warwickshire County Council to discover what effect the new road was having on traffic levels on other roads it was built to relieve. The results indicated that traffic on Bilton Lane had dropped by 79 per cent, the A4071 Main Street in Bilton was down 28 per cent, the number of vehicles using the A426 Newbold Road had fallen by 26 per cent, and the A428 at Church Lawford was down 14 per cent.

Content is either primarily hosted on a dedicated server, which is owned by the service provider, or it is hosted primarily on the hard drives of its customers using a P2P protocol with, perhaps, a dedicated server to supplement. One example of the older business model is the iTunes Store, which still markets and prices data as individual retail products. There are no examples of the latter business model in operation yet, but one is currently in development by Global Gaming Factory X and expected to begin operation some time after they acquire The Pirate Bay domain on August 27, 2009. A key difference between the two models is that the model which relies on its customer base for offering their bandwidth for other customers to access customer hosted data can operate at significantly lower costs than a company that seeks to limit data access to a per-download fee in order to supplement the cost of using its own hosting and bandwidth. The P2P model holds the potential for companies to offer unlimited access to the largest data library in the history of the internet to its customers for a reasonably low membership rate that is relevant to the cost of operation. While the market is virtually untouched, the P2P supplemented model will need entrepreneurs who are able to overcome a series of challenges in order to compete with the older business model as well as that which is offered for free (and often against the wishes of copyright holders) by hundreds of P2P communities on the internet. These challenges include, but are not limited to: Offering better data quality, speed, convenience and ease of use, protocol, sense of security, indexing and search organization, site up time, data library size, customer support, advertising, artist/copyright holder incentives and compensation, incentives and compensation for customers hosting data and providing bandwidth, guaranteed seeding (available access to indexed data at all times), than competitors.

He played college football at the University of Arizona. Early years Livingston attended Mesa High School where he first began to play football and was a two-way player. He was named to the All-state team at halfback in his last 2 years. In track, he set the school long jump record and was a 3-time state champion. He accepted a scholarship from the University of Arizona, where he became a three-year starter. He was a two-way player and a versatile athlete, that in games was used as a running back, cornerback and wide receiver. In 1959, he received All-Border Conference honors after averaging 6.7 yards per carry and leading his team in rushing with 380 yards, while his teammate Walt Mince had a 6.1-yard average. In 1960, although he was more focused on defense, he set a school record with an 80-yard punt return against the University of Colorado Boulder. He also had one of his best games against the three touchdown favored Arizona State University team, that was looking to win a fifth Territorial Cup in a row. In the game, he had a 60-yard touchdown in a 35-7 upset. Livingston also was a part of the track and field team, where he competed in the long jump, high jump and sprints. His 24 feet long jump in 1960, made him the third best jumper in school history. He highjumped 6-1. He won several scholastic honors while studying engineering. In 1991, he was inducted into the University of Arizona Sports Hall of Fame. Professional career Livingston was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys, after not being selected in the 1961 NFL draft. He was moved to cornerback and became a starter as a rookie, until suffering a serious fracture on his left arm against the St. Louis Cardinals and being placed on the injured reserve list on November 6. He was named to the NFL All-rookie team at the end of the year. In 1962, he missed most of the pre-season with another injury to the same arm, which limited him to play in only 3 games during the regular season. The next year, he was named the starter at free safety, because he was considered a great open field tackler. In 1964, he was moved back to cornerback and although he was waived on September 3, he was later re-signed and did not miss any games, splitting time (7 starts) with Don Bishop at right cornerback. The next two years he was the regular starter at right cornerback. Livingston experienced a difficult 1966 NFL Championship Game against the Green Bay Packers, where he was targeted on key third down plays that would impact the final result. He was released on September 5, 1967, after being passed on the depth chart by Mike Johnson.

It is operated by the Borderland Racing Association. It is one of only two tracks under WISSOTA sanction in Ontario. In 2009, the track celebrated its 55th Anniversary of the original opening. The Borderland Racing Association currently hosts three different classes and range from Street Stocks (Entry level), the WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds (Moderate Level), to WISSOTA Modifieds (Advanced Level). Street Stocks are \\"Stock Cars\\" as they have a full body and frame from passenger type automobiles seen on the street (Such as a 1974 Monte Carlo). They are required to have a minimum weight of 3200 lbs (1,451 kg), a stock maximum 355c.i.d. (360 for Chryslers), as well as OEM parts.Borderland Racing Association '2008 Street Stock Rules' Retrieved February 16, 2009 WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds are similar to Street Stocks in that their engine is a maximum 355c.i.d., however, they are open wheeled (No fenders) and have a minimum weight of 2600 lbs (1,179 kg).WISSOTA Promoters Association '2009 Rulebook' Retrieved February 16, 2009 As well, suspension and rear-end are more adjustable. The highest class at the Emo Speedway is the WISSOTA Modifieds. This class is similar in appearance as a WISSOTA Midwest Modified with the exception of some cosmetic differences. However, the WISSOTA Modified class has a minimum weight of 2450 lbs (1,111 kg) and can run a Manual Transmission, a Spec Engine (Turning out up to 600-650 hp), and an alcohol fuel option. The season consists of 16-18 race nights (Heat races and one feature per night, per class and consolations if necessary), although due to rainouts during the season, an average of 12-14 races are run for the championship. Each class runs their own season points. Points are tallied every weekend based on the point system by the Sanctioning body of WISSOTA. Points go to the driver in the WISSOTA classes and to the car number in the Street Stocks. History One Class of Cars (1950s and 1960s) The first racing season started on July 30, 1954 and only one class competed. Cars with all types of engines raced including Mathieu's V12 Rocket. The season started out with thirteen competitors and the number fluctuated very little until the end of the season in September. According to the Daily Journal in International Falls, #411 \\"King Al\\" Gerald of International Falls, MN won the first \\"championship\\" called the \\"Cup\\". Races were also held whenever possible, but was usually on a Friday, and they occurred as many times as three a week. In 1955, #37 Raoul \\"The Flying Frenchman\\" Cayer of Nestor Falls, Ontario won his first championship at the Emo Speedway and also took honours as the time trial champion in that year. Al McDowell took the championship in 1956. Currently, it is unknown who won the championships in 1957 to 1959.\\"Accident Jinx at Emo Speedway hits Ernie Pretula\\", Fort Frances Times, September 22, 1955 The track was closed at the end of the 1959 season. The track reopened in 1965, but it is uncertain whether a points season was tallied. Currently, there is no information of champions from 1965 and 1966. In 1967, #54 Larry Kennedy took the championship, his only title in his years of racing at the speedway. In 1968, the underdog of the Emo Speedway, #33 George Oltsher Canadian Racer 'Emo Speedway Champions List' Retrieved February 16, 2009 would be triumphant in beating the much bigger competition to win his first championship of three he would earn. George Oltsher's famous #33 Chevy Coupe would win one championship in the 1960s and two in the 1970s 1969 saw owner Ed Rea with his driver #38 Mike Andrusco win the championship in the last season of the 1960s. The Introduction of a Second Class (1970s) 1970 saw #33 George Oltsher return to the champions circle at the end of the season, the last year in which there was only one class of cars. 1971 saw the introduction of Hobby Stocks. Although the rules are currently not known to the full extent, Hobby Stocks provided a different and specific set of rules and guidelines that would make cars more even on the track. The first Hobby Stock Champion was #1 Borden Beeler in 1971, while #36 Larry Long of International Falls, MN would win the top class. Both classes would run championship point seasons until 1973. There were no points in 1974 due to a shortened season and 1975 had only a few events. The Emo Speedway would shut down until its second revival in 1983. The Return of Season Championships (1980s) After three years of exhibition racing, the Borderland Racing Association became the operating body of the Emo Speedway. The first full season started in 1986. Two classes were run (Modifieds, Street Stocks) and they had locally created rules. A son of Ed Rea, #38 Dan Rea would win the Modified championship, while #35 Harold \\"Beaker\\" Duivenvoorden would take the Street Stock championship. In 1989, The Modifieds became sanctioned with WISSOTA, (A Promoters Association with a common set of rules and regulations), allowing the class to have to ability to travel to other \\"WISSOTA\\" tracks and also compete for a National Championship. #19 John Hettinga celebrates his win at Emo Speedway in 1991. He would win his second championship in a row in 1992. The Addition of a Third Class (1990s) In 1992, with the concentrated effort of a group of volunteers, the Thunder Class was created. The \\"Thunders\\" ran a smaller engine than the Street Stocks with an engine no bigger than 305c.i.d. and an unlocked rear-end differential. The cars were slower but became an affordable entry level class for teenagers and young adults to get into racing. It was hard to distinguish them in appearance as the main differences were under the hood. Driving partners #7 Scott Gobeil and Donnie May would become the season champions of the new class at the Emo Speedway. However the class would be removed in 1995 due to low numbers. In 1994, the Mini-Sprint class started full seasons at the Emo Speedway. The class was very different from what had been seen at the Speedway before. The appearance of the car had a short wheelbase, two wings (on top and in the front) and ran a snowmobile engine that turned out a maximum 600cc. In that year, the Borderland Racing Association ran four classes of cars. Currently, the season champion of the Mini-Sprints during their inaugural season is unknown. End of Mini-Sprints and addition of WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds (2000s) The WISSOTA Midwest Modified class was new to the Emo Speedway in 2004. At the end of 2004, after eleven seasons of Mini-Sprints, the class was canceled due to a severe shortage of cars. During the Annual Rea Memorial weekend (The biggest weekend of the year), only three Mini-Sprints entered which was the complete opposite usually experienced on the two-day weekend event. Mini-Sprint driver #2X4 Ken Perry would win the last championship for the Mini-Sprints, while #11 Anthony Visser, (Former Street Stock and Thunder Stock racer) won the inaugural WISSOTA Midwest Modified Championship. The WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds peaked its average of nineteen cars a week in 2009, with a decline to fourteen cars on average in 2010. Championship Records Ron Westover currently has the most championships (7) for a driver at Emo Speedway. #14C Cody Ossachuk (2015-2019) has won five championships in a row. #17 Christopher Leek (2011-2014) and #99 Brody Strachan (2016-2019) have both won four championships in row. #2R Ricky Roche (1996‚Äì1998), #33 Kendal Gamsby (2006‚Äì2008), and #16 Gavin Paull (2011-2013) and #2X4 Ken Perry (1998-2000) have three championships in a row. There are several drivers that have won a championship two years in a row. These include #91X Rudy Anderson in the Street Stocks (1989‚Äì1990), #23 Chuck Arpin in the WISSOTA Modifieds (1990‚Äì1991), #19 John Hettinga (1991‚Äì1992) in Street Stocks, #35 Colin Johnson (1993‚Äì1994) in Street Stocks, #15 Ron Westover (2002‚Äì2003) in the Street Stocks, #91 Victor Larson (2003‚Äì2004) in the WISSOTA Modifieds, and #14F Greg Ferris in the WISSOTA Modifieds (2008‚Äì2009). #15 Ron Westover has the most total championships at the Emo Speedway with seven (7), (1995, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2007, 2010, 2013). One championship, (1995) was in the Thunder Stocks while the others are in the Street Stocks. , #16 Gavin Paull and #2X4 Ken Perry has the next number of championships at five, with , #19 John Hettinga and #33 Kendal Gamsby with four. Three of John Hettinga's are in the Street Stocks (1991,1992, 2004) and one in the WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds (2005), all of Ken Perry's is in the Mini-Sprints, all of Gavin Paull's is in the WISSOTA Modifieds and Kendal Gamsby has three in WISSOTA Midwest Modifieds and one in Street Stocks. The number 33 has the most championships (9) for a car number. Three of them are by George Oltsher (1968,1970, 1972), one by Scott Gobeil (1993), four by Kendal Gamsby (2006,2007,2008, 2014) and one by Cole Chernosky (2020). All #15 Championships have been won by Ron Westover Champions List ***Note: Seasons that had Championships are the only ones included in the list of champions. There were years in which the races occurred at some point in the season but did not run a points championship. Championship records are declared based on information that has been provided so far, as more information is discovered, records may change. WISSOTA Super Stocks were run in 1996 and 1997, #5 Steve Boyum of International Falls was the 1996 Champion.

While the University of Michigan had fielded \\"football\\" teams in 1879 and 1880, those teams played a game that was more in line with traditional rugby, and many consider the 1881 team to be the first at Michigan to play American football. The team finished with a record of 0‚Äì3 after playing the top teams in the country ‚Äì Harvard, Yale and Princeton. Season overview The 1881 season was only the third during which Michigan fielded a football team. Prior to 1881, Michigan had played only three games, two against the University of Toronto and one against Racine College in Chicago. Moreover, the game played by Michigan was more in the nature of British rugby rather than American football. One author has observed: \\"When the Michigan rugby team went East in November of 1881 they were playing a more traditional rugby game than their eastern counterparts.\\" The players on the Michigan team came from throughout the western states, including Illinois (Frank Wormwood and team captain and quarterback Walter S. Horton), Iowa (Richard Dott and Fred Townsend), North Dakota (the DePuy brothers), the Upper Peninsula (fullback William J. Olcott), and even Florida (Purl Woodruff). In 1881, Michigan scheduled games against the top American football teams‚Äîthe Eastern powerhouses of Harvard, Yale and Princeton. Every year between 1870 and 1893, only Yale, Princeton, or Harvard has been credited with the consensus or shared national championship except Columbia in 1875. Retrospective historical power ratings have ranked them as the top three college football teams of 1881. The Michigan-Harvard game, which was played on Halloween 1881, was the first time any of the elite Eastern teams had played a team from the West. In his history of college football, David M. Nelson cites Michigan's 1881 Eastern trip as the origin of intersectional football: \\"In 1881 football became an intersectional game with the University of Michigan invading the East to play Harvard, Princeton and Yale.\\" Michigan played all three games in the East over a five-day period between October 31, 1881, and November 4, 1881. While Michigan lost all three games, the games were close, and the Michigan team earned the respect of the Eastern press. Forward Fred Townsend wrote about the trip in 1901, saying: > We were a lot of inexperienced players, without team work, depending > entirely on individual play. Our half-backs, I believe, were equal to any we > met, but our line was weak, the men being light and having little > experience. Most of us had never played in a match game and some of us had > never seen a copy of the rules. Having lost all of its games and being outscored 28‚Äì4, the 1881 Michigan team holds the distinction of having the worst record in the school's history‚Äîa record that has not been matched in the more than 125 years of football that followed. After the 1881 season, Michigan did not schedule any intercollegiate games in 1882 and did not return to intercollegiate play until 1883. Schedule Press accounts of the games October 31: Harvard 4, Michigan 0 Walter S. Horton, captain of Michigan's 1881 football team The Boston Journal carried a lengthy article about the Michigan-Harvard game, which it summarized as follows: > \\"Yesterday afternoon, in a drenching rain, for the first time an Eastern > foot-ball eleven played with a Western eleven. The Western college boys have > long wished a chance to try their powers with Eastern opponents, and, to > effect this, the University of Michigan this fall have sent on a > representative eleven to play the largest of the Eastern colleges. Their > first opponent were the Harvard team. They were beaten but with fair weather > the result would have been very uncertain. As it was, Harvard won more by > luck than by superiority in strength or skill, for with the exception of the > first ten minutes they were forced to play a defensive game. ... At 3:15, in > the midst of a drenching rain, the game began. Perhaps a hundred spectators > had by this time gathered.\\" Harvard scored the only points of the game in the first half on a play that was disputed by Michigan's players. The Boston Journal noted: > \\"Individual players kept losing their temper, and much time was wasted in > upclose quarreling over little questions of no account. If the Westerners > hadn't talked so much they might have won, or at least tied the game. ... > During the second half hour the ball was near the Harvard line constantly. > Once it came within three feet of the chalk, but the most desperate fighting > on the Harvard forced it back foot by foot until the immediate danger was > over. ... The Michigan team excelled in running, and their tackling was very > fair. As to passing, they did very little. It was by all odds the best game > seen in Boston this fall.\\" Another Massachusetts paper, The Fitchburg Sentinel, reported: \\"The Harvard university football team won one touch-down at Cambridge, Monday, and the Michigan university team won nothing.\\" November 2: Yale 11, Michigan 0 William J. Olcott, fullback from Ishpeming, Michigan Michigan's worst defeat on the Eastern trip was an 11‚Äì0 defeat against Yale. The next day, the New Haven Evening Register carried the following account of the game: > \\"The Yale foot ball team easily defeated the players from the University of > Michigan at Hamilton Park, yesterday afternoon, in the presence of 500 > people. The Yales outplayed their opponents in every particular, and kept > the ball near their goal during the greater part of the game. ... The score > was: Yale, 2 goals, University of Michigan, no goals, Touchdowns for safety: > Yale none, University of Michigan 8. Olcott and DePuy played a good game for > the visitors.\\" November 4: Princeton 13, Michigan 4 The final game of the trip was a 13‚Äì4 loss to Princeton. One New Jersey newspaper reported: \\"The Princeton College team were victorious Thursday in a football match with the team of the University of Michigan after an exciting struggle.\\" New Jersey's Daily State Gazette wrote: \\"A finely contested game of football at the University grounds Friday, between Princeton and University of Michigan resulted in a victory for the home team, Princeton 1 goal, 2 touchdowns; University of Michigan 0.\\" Players 1881 Michigan Football Team Profile from \\"The Palladium\\" The following players were members of the 1881 football team according to the roster published in the 1882 edition of \\"The Palladium\\", the University of Michigan yearbook.

It lived around 231 million years ago, during the Carnian age of the Late Triassic period in what is now northwestern Argentina. Fossils of the genus were found in the La Pe√±a Member of the Ischigualasto Formation in the Ischigualasto- Villa Uni√≥n Basin. The name Panphagia comes from the Greek words ', meaning \\"all\\", and ', meaning \\"to eat\\", in reference to its inferred omnivorous diet. Panphagia is one of the earliest known dinosaurs, and is an important find which may mark the transition of diet in early sauropodomorph dinosaurs.

Restoration Fossils of Panphagia were found in late 2006 by the Argentinean paleontologist Ricardo N. Mart√≠nez in rocks of the Ischigualasto Formation of Valle Pintado, Ischigualasto Provincial Park, San Juan Province, Argentina. The bones were found at approximately the same level as a 231.4 million year old ash layer, indicating it lived during the early Carnian of the Late Triassic. Panphagia is currently known from holotype PVSJ 874, the disarticulated remains of one partially grown individual of about long.

Alcober, both of the Museo de Ciencias Naturales, in San Juan, Argentina. They performed a phylogenetic analysis and found it to be the most basal known sauropodomorph dinosaur: the fossils shared similar features to those of Saturnalia, an early sauropodomorph, including similarities in the ischium, astragalus, and the scapular blade. Yet the fossils also exhibited similar features to those of Eoraptor, an early carnivorous saurischian, including hollow bones, sublanceolate teeth, and overall proportions. Based on analysis and comparison of the Panphagia fossils and those of its closest kin, Mart√≠nez and Alcober concluded that the evolution of saurischian dinosaurs likely began with small, cursorial animals similar to Panphagia, and that there is a \\"general similarity among all of these basal dinosaurs [suggesting] that few structural changes stand\\" between Panphagia, Eoraptor, and two basal theropods which have yet to be described. The type species of Panphagia is P. protos; the specific name, meaning \\"the first\\" in Greek, is a reference to its basal position.  Diet  Preserved skull bones of Panphagia protos (PVSJ 874) The teeth of Panphagia indicate a possible omnivorous diet, transitional in form between the mostly carnivorous theropods and the herbivorous sauropodomorphs. The teeth in the back of the jaw are shorter than those in the front, are leaf-shaped, and also have more marked serrations.

It was initially released as a PlayStation Portable exclusive in Japan on May 28, 2009, in North America on October 13, 2009 and in Europe on February 19, 2010. It was re-released on the Xbox Live Arcade on June 29, 2011 under the title Half-Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax, and on Microsoft Windows' Steam on September 27, 2012 under the title Half-Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy. A sequel, Y≈´sha 30 Second, was released in Japan on August 4, 2011. It was localized and released on Steam on April 4, 2014 as Half-Minute Hero: The Second Coming. Gameplay Half-Minute Heros single player mode features 6 different game modes. Each mode is based on one part of a larger story, and as such, the last three modes are not available until the player has completed the first three modes; these last three modes are then unlocked in order after completing the previous mode. Each mode centers around a mechanic based on a limited amount of time (normally 30 seconds as implied by the game's title) to complete that part of the game. *Hero 30 Mode plays similar to a role-playing video game. The player, as the Hero, is tasked by the Time Goddess to become powerful enough in 30 seconds to find and defeat an enemy boss that is seeking to cast a spell of destruction that will end the world in 30 seconds. To do so, the Hero explores an overworld, encountering random monsters with battles that take place automatically based on the Hero's current equipment to gain experience levels. The Hero can enter towns where the Time Goddess will pause time, allowing for time to shop for equipment and health items, talk to residents and find allies to help in battle, as well to pay money to a statue of the Goddess to reset the countdown timer to 30 seconds. Each successive use of this power becomes more costly to the player. There are 30 missions in this mode which are completed in succession; the player can go back to previous missions to try to better their performance or find additional equipment that will carry over into future missions; however, the player cannot use equipment gained on later missions during an earlier mission. *Evil Lord 30 Mode plays similar to a real-time strategy game. The player controls Evil Lord who can summon three types of creatures, Brawlers, Shooters and Nimbles, to fight enemy forces and complete a task. The monster strengths are based on a Rock- paper-scissors approach; Nimbles are strong against Shooters and weak against Brawlers, for example. The overall strength of summoned creatures is based on the size of a mana ring that is shown around the Evil Lord character; summoning creatures and taking damage reduces the size of this ring. Wandering creatures can be brought into the Evil Lord's control by moving the mana ring over them. Due to his nature, the Evil Lord can only be out-of-doors for 30 seconds at a time, thus enforcing a 30-second countdown timer, but by paying money gained from defeating enemies to barrels where the Time Goddess is waiting, the countdown timer can be reset. There are also 30 missions to complete in this mode, but include branching paths. *Princess 30 Mode plays similar to a shoot 'em up game. The player controls the Princess who is equipped with a rapid-fire crossbow as her main weapon, and a number of guards that carry and protect her as she ventures out of the castle to get items to help her ailing father. However, she is imposed with a 30-second curfew, and her speed is dictated by the number of guards in her group; running into enemies will cause guards to fall out of the group, though the Princess can never be directly harmed. The Time Goddess has provided stretches of red carpets which, while the Princess is over them, will roll back the countdown timer but cost money to do so. The 30 missions are provided in a branching manner, with some missions leading to the ability to boost the crossbow's power or increase the running speed of the guards. *Knight 30 Mode is an action video game, where the player controls a Knight who has vowed to help protect a Sage. The Sage has the ability to cast a spell of destruction that takes 30 seconds (though need not be continuous) to evoke; the Knight is tasked with defending the Sage during this time. This can be done by ramming into or throwing objects at enemies to stun them, or carrying the Sage to a safe location (during which the Sage cannot continue the spell). Certain levels features bells that distract the Sage and reset the spell's timer, but they can be destroyed by the Knight. If the Sage takes too much damage, the player must start the level over. The 30 missions in this mode must be completed in order. *Hero 300 Mode is similar to Hero 30 Mode, but the player has 300 seconds to complete the single mission of this mode. The Time Goddess is not available in this mode, and furthermore, certain areas of the map become inaccessible every 60 seconds of the game, requiring the player to continue moving to find and defeat the final boss as fast as possible. *Hero 3 Mode is also similar to Hero 30 Mode, but the player only starts with 3 seconds to reach and defeat the boss in the mode's single mission. Unlike Hero 300, the Time Goddess is available to reset time as necessary. There is also a limited multiplayer mode in which two heroes can fight to complete a quest before the other. The multiplayer mode features three stages in which the two players will fight to collect power ups and level up in order to fight the Evil Lord at the end. Development Half-Minute Hero was originally a downloadable freeware game called \\"30-Second Hero\\", whose concept was adopted by the producer for a PSP title. It was designed to be a quirky adaptation of the traditional, lengthy role-playing video game formula into 30 second intervals. The 8-bit graphics were designed to appear \\"old-school\\", resembling 8-bit RPGs such as early Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy games, and make the player use their imagination. Soundtrack The soundtrack of Half-Minute Hero features contributions from many well known Japanese game composers. They include Toshihiko Takamizawa, Yoshino Aoki, Hideki Asanaka, Kakeru Ishihama, Hiroyuki Iwatsuki, Yuzo Koshiro, Motoi Sakuraba, Koji Hayama, Norihiko Hibino, Takushi Hiyamuta, Kenji Fujisawa, Hiromi Mizutani, Yasumasa Yamada, Yasuo Yamate, Biei Morioka, Toru Nakagawa, Minako Adachi, and Megumi Komagata. Half-Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Half-Minute Hero was re-released for the XBLA on June 29, 2011 as Half-Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax. This version contains the \\"Super Mega Neo Climax\\" mode which allows the game to be played with enhanced graphics more akin to anime than 8-bit RPGs. Additionally, the \\"Evil Lord 30,\\" \\"Princess 30,\\" and \\"Knight 30\\" modes have been significantly reworked. Instead of the altering game styles found in the PSP version, the XBLA versions of these modes are identical in play style to \\"Hero 30\\" and feature only one level. The \\"Hero 30\\" campaign does have 6 new quests stemming from the \\"Treasure Land\\" stage, though. These quests involve the Overlord being awakened early and the hero has to acquire the aid of the five time beasts, however these levels also replace the \\"Another Goddess\\" stage found in the original version. The sound test mode, art gallery, and bestiary have also been removed from the XBLA version, normally unlocked after completing \\"Hero 3\\" in the PSP version. Other changes include the addition of achievements, online multiplayer, as well as possible future downloadable content. Half-Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy Half-Minute Hero was re-released for the PC on Steam and Playism on September 27, 2012 as Half-Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy. This version is a compilation of almost all of the game modes that featured in the previous releases with the exception of the Another Goddess and Valhalla Knights stages. Sequel A sequel titled Y≈´sha 30 Second was released in Japan for the PSP on August 4, 2011. It was localized by Marvelous USA and released on Windows via Steam on April 4, 2014 as Half-Minute Hero: The Second Coming. Reception Critical reception Half-Minute Hero received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the PSP version a score of one eight, one nine, and two eights for a total of 33 out of 40.

B. It is endemic to northeastern Australia, found on the upper continental slope off Queensland from south of the Samaurez Reef, at a depth of . Its specific epithet delicatus is Latin for \\"delicate\\", referring to the fine teeth on its saw-like rostrum. This is a small species; the maximum known length is for females and for males (although no mature males have yet been examined). The body is slender with a circular cross-section, and depressed forward of the gill slits. The elongated, saw-like snout tapers evenly to its tip, and bears very slender lateral teeth of variable length and a pair of filamentous, dorsoventrally flattened barbels. The eyes are large and oval in shape. Its nostrils about one-third the distance from the corner of the mouth to the barbel attachment on the rostrum.Dianne J. Bray, 2011, Pristiophorus delicatus, in Fishes of Australia, accessed 16 Oct 2014, http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/species/2611 The mouth is large and broadly arched; there are 47 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 37 in the lower. The teeth have flattened, oval bases and a single narrow, pointed cusp. The pectoral fins are large with narrowed rounded tips and weakly concave rear margins. The two dorsal fins are well-separated, the first longer and broader than the second. The caudal fin is short, with the lower lobe absent. The coloration is medium brown above and white below; there are pronounced white rear margins on the dorsal and caudal fins. The paired fins are mostly pale with brownish basal portions clearly demarcated from the rest of the fin. Very little is known of the biology of the tropical sawshark; its small size may indicate that it is reproductively productive. There is little fishing pressure within its range, and so it is classified as of Least Concern by the World Conservation Union.

In 1822, Antonio Ygnacio Avila was granted a permit from the new Mexican government to utilize grazing land totaling approximately 25,000 acres on what was to become Rancho Sausal Redondo. Avila received a land grant of Rancho Sausal Redondo for most of this land from Governor Juan Alverado on May 20, 1837.Bruce L. Megowan, Maureen D. Megowan, Historic Tales from Palos Verdes and the South Bay, The History Press, Charleston, SC, Jul 1, 2014, p.103 With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Sausal Redondo was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States. District Court (California : Southern District) Land Case 354 SD and the grant was patented to Antonio Ygnacio Avila in 1855.Report of the Surveyor General 1844‚Äì1886 Antonio Avila died in 1858, and in 1868 Avila's heirs were forced to sell the rancho to pay the probate costs. The Rancho was sold to Sir Robert Burnett (11th. Baronet, 1876‚Äì1894) who used the land for sheep and cattle raising. Having previously acquired Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela, Burnett combined the total area into the Centinela Ranch, thus reuniting the major area of the original land grant. Clear title to the land did not occur until 1873, when a U.S. District Court upheld Burnett's purchase against a suit filed by Avila heir Tomas Avila Sanchez. In 1873, Robert Burnett leased the land to Daniel Freeman and returned to his native Scotland. Freeman moved to the ranch with his family, increased the stock, and planted citrus trees. When the 1875 drought ruined the livestock industry, Freeman turned to dry farming. In 1885, Freeman purchased the remainder of Rancho Sausal Redondo.

The online petition maintained by the Creative Freedom Foundation has over 17,000 signatures. Second blackout Anti-piracy legislation was re-introduced in April 2011 by the New Zealand Government under the Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Amendment Bill. Although somewhat watered down from the original Section 92a legislation, it still contained forcible disconnection provisions, and was passed under urgency by all parties with the exception of the Greens and two dissident MPs, Chris Carter and Hone Harawira. This use of urgency was highly controversial, with many in the Internet community accusing the Government of invoking urgency to push through highly contentious laws. Additionally, many opponents of the new law called for a return of the 2009 blackout, who also ridiculed the televised performances of several MPs who defended the law.

History   Conflicts  In 2009, the station was assigned to WWVA-FM 105.7, allowing it to circumvent the prohibition on airing original programming by having it simulcast on an HD Radio channel on WWVA. On April 4, it became hip-hop Streetz 102.9, but went silent a few days later when the person responsible for the new station, the former head of the Radio One Atlanta station group, was sued by Radio One for allegedly using his former position to take the group's intellectual property (including remixes) and violating a non-compete clause. The translator was started by Radio Assist Ministry and was granted a construction permit in late May 2004 as W223AO on 92.5 MHz. It does not appear to have gone on-air until 2007 when it finally received a broadcast license to cover, and supposedly relayed Georgia Public Broadcasting station WJSP-FM 88.1 (apparently without permission). In August 2008, it changed to W222BE/92.3, and then under an engineering-related special temporary authorization filed the day after it got its license for this, changed a month later to its current callsign and frequency. It was almost immediately sold to Extreme Media Group, which is owned and run by one of the two people previously involved with Radio One. In early 2009, it went on-air relaying WCLK/91.9. Another local station which airs its own programming, W250BC/97.9, was also started by RAM and then sold to EMG. It traded the station to Cumulus Media in exchange for another one. Because of that station being involved with EMG, Cumulus was also named in the lawsuit, though there was no injunction preventing that station from operating. The station was located on one of the two towers near Edgewood. It was authorized to transmit 110 (previously 170) watts at HAAT, but as of March 2012 it was still off-air. Its calculated broadcast range is roughly the same as the area within Interstate 285, but offset a few miles or several kilometres to the southeast. In December 2009, the lawsuit was resolved such that this translator was transferred to Radio One (via ROA Licenses LLC, meaning Radio One Atlanta) in February 2010, giving it a fifth radio station in Atlanta, as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allows translators to ignore the restrictions on excessive concentration of media ownership in a media market. Although the license transferred had not yet been FCC-approved, the translator was assigned per the consent decree to parent station WAMJ FM 107.5, owned by Radio One.http://cdbs.recnet.com/fmq.php?call=w275bk Subsequent history In January 2010, the station applied for and was granted a construction permit to increase to 160 watts at , and relocate west to the WUPA TV 43 (69.1) tower in the Inman Park neighborhood of Atlanta. It submitted an application for a license to cover the permit in early April 2010, and within a few days started transmitting WHTA FM 107.9, which is also carried on WAMJ's HD Radio channel 2. As is common in radio broadcasting, this may or may not have been the radio format that the station's owners intended to use long-term, but rather one intended to mislead competitors. As of June 2012 however, it was still broadcasting WHTA, thus it appeared the only purpose of the station is to cause radio tuners doing a channel scan to stop immediately before getting to competitor V-103 (WVEE FM 103.3), two channels (0.4 MHz) directly above the \\"translator\\". In late June 2012, the format and voiceovers of Streetz 102.9 returned to W233BF as \\"Streetz 94-5\\". In early July 2012, W275BK switched from airing \\"Hot 107-9\\" (WHTA FM 107.9) to Praise 102.5 (WPZE), while still listing WAMJ as the primary station, both with the FCC and in the required hourly station IDs. The hourly ID lists all three stations (WPZE, WAMJ HD2, and W275BK) at every hour, rather than omitting the translator's callsign except for certain required times as other stations do. The station does not extend the coverage of WPZE. On November 25, 2014, at 5 p.m., W275BK broke from the WPZE simulcast and flipped to the rapidly expanding classic hip hop format, branded as \\"Boom 102.9.\\" The station is still being simulcast on WAMJ-HD2. This marks the third station in the market with the format, after WTZA (and FM translator W257DF 99.3) and W250BC (WWWQ-HD3) flipped within a week of each other. Boom! Atlanta Gains Third Classic Hip Hop Signal On December 22, 2017, at Noon, after playing \\"Christmas Rappin'\\" by Kurtis Blow, the station flipped to urban oldies as Classix 102.9, with the first song being \\"Let's Stay Together\\" by Al Green; the station added the Tom Joyner Morning Show the following month after having been dropped by WALR-FM in November 2017, as well as The D.L. Hughley Show for afternoons. In the northern and eastern suburbs, the station is often overwhelmed by WDUN-FM 102.9 in Gainesville, Georgia. Overnight temperature inversions cause cooler air to settle in the Chattahoochee River valley, which then traps and directs the signal southwestward toward the metro area. Seeing the signal problems in this area, Radio One started simulcasting W275BK's format on WUMJ on January 10, 2016, as the recent signal upgrade of WAMJ in 2013 resulted in most listeners moving to the latter frequency, making 97.5 expendable.

Life Marina Karella was born in Athens on 17 July 1940 to industrialist Theodor Karella and Elly Chalikiopoulos. In 1960, Karella was enrolled at the Athens School of Fine Arts, where she studied till 1963. She then continued with her studies at the √âcole des Beaux- Arts in Paris and the Academy of Fine Arts in Salzburg, having also trained under notable artists like Oscar Kokoschka and Yannis Tsarouchis. On 7 February 1965, she married Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark at the Royal Palace in Athens. However, because the marriage was considered non-dynastic, she did not automatically acquire the title of 'Princess of Greece and Denmark' nor the style of 'Her Royal Highness', but is instead referred to as Marina, Consort of Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark. The couple has two daughters: Princess Alexandra (born 15 October 1968 in Athens) and Princess Olga of Greece (born 17 November 1971 in Athens). Work Karella began her career in 1966, when she presented her first exhibition of paintings at the Festival of Two Worlds in Italy. Her early career was heavily inspired by themes related to Greece. In the '70s she exhibited her White Paintings at Gallery Ioulas, which are now considered among the most famous pieces of her work. The following decade, Karella put up multiple exhibitions at the Earl McGrath Gallery in New York, which also included collaborations with Jack Pierson. Throughout the '90s her work was featured in multiple publications, including The New Yorker and New York (magazine). During her career Karella has put up a number of exhibitions in various cities around the world, such as New York, Los Angeles, Athens, Brussels, Rome, and London, while many of her works are also hosted in many museums and institutions. In 2005, a retrospective exhibition of her work was organized at the Benaki Museum in Athens. In more recent years, Karella has increasingly ventured into philanthropic works and is currently the founder and president of Eliza, a non-profit society that works towards the prevention of cruelty against children.

He commanded a cavalry brigade at various times and was paroled as a brigadier general at the end of the war but his appointment as a brigadier general by Confederate President Jefferson Davis was rejected twice by the Confederate States Senate. Early life Hodge was born in Fleming County, Kentucky to William and Sarah (Baird) Hodge.By 1850, the family had moved to Mason County, Kentucky. He received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland and was graduated as a midshipman, December 16, 1845. Hodge was later promoted to acting lieutenant, but eventually resigned his commission January 28, 1850. Hodge married Keturah Moss Tibbatts, daughter of Colonel John Wooleston Tibbatts. They had seven children: S. Catherine Taylor (c.1853-1886), Anna Taylor (1854‚Äì1923), Jane \\"Nan\\"/\\"Nannie\\" (1855‚Äì1856), Mary (1856‚Äì1869), William Baird (1857‚Äì1873), Georgena Baird (1859‚Äì1927), and John T. (1864‚Äì1934). Politics Hodge unsuccessfully ran for the United States House of Representatives in 1852. He was later admitted to the bar in Newport, Kentucky where he practiced law for several years. In 1859, Hodge was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives as a Democrat. The following year he served as an elector for the Breckinridge ticket. Civil War Sketch of Brigadier General Hodge Hodge enlisted in the Confederate Army as a private in 1861. Soon thereafter, he was chosen to represent Kentucky in the Provisional Confederate Congress from 1861 to 1862. When Hodge was not present in Richmond, Virginia, he was promoted to captain and assistant adjutant general in Breckinridge's First Kentucky Brigade. Hodge received a promotion to major May 6, 1862, for gallantry at the Battle of Shiloh and served as a cavalry brigade commander under Joseph Wheeler and Nathan Bedford Forrest. Wheeler commended Hodge for his service during the Middle Tennessee Raid. Forrest, however, relieved Hodge of his command, charging him with incompetence and cowardice. Hodge was acquitted of the charges and later reinstated to field command. He was promoted to colonel May 6, 1863, and briefly served as inspector-general at Cumberland Gap. Hodge represented Kentucky in the House of Representatives of the First Confederate Congress from February 18, 1862, to February 17, 1864. After his term expired, he was promoted to colonel and inspector-general and assigned command of the District of Southwest Mississippi and East Louisiana, a post he held until the end of the war. Hodge was promoted acting brigadier general November 20, 1863, but the promotion was rejected by the Confederate Senate. The promotion was resubmitted August 2, 1864, and, again, went unconfirmed. Although he was paroled as a brigadier general and Warner lists him as a Confederate general, Eicher shows him as unconfirmed at that grade and does not list him as a general. Later life After the Civil War, Hodge returned to his law practice in Newport. He remained active in politics and served as an elector for the Greeley ticket in 1872. Hodge was elected to the Kentucky Senate and served 1873 to 1877. He also became an orange grower and spent the last years of his life in Florida. He died August 1, 1892 in Longwood, FloridaSome sources state Orange County, Florida and was interred in Seminole, Florida. His remains were moved to Evergreen Cemetery, Southgate, Kentucky in 1903.

However, it has been used successfully in other government agencies and in the private sector. At its core is the notion of iterative, low cost, first-to-market development. The term 'disruptive' was borrowed from the marketing term disruptive technologies. DSP was created in 2005 by fighter pilot and United States Air Force/Air National Guard Colonel Edward Vaughan.Face of Defense: Air Guardsman Entrepreneurial Approach.. Overview Typical defense industry bureaucratic approach to problem solving involves exquisite, enterprise solutions requiring long lead times, establishment of large, standing teams, and relative inflexibility. The long development cycles and lead times associated with this approach sometimes result in fielding a solution that is no longer relevant. Recent attempts to resolve inefficiencies may include overwhelming with superior funding, resources, and manpower‚Äîfor example, take any major weapon systems development such as a new fighter jet or IT system. Conversely, when resources are constrained, bureaucratic staff adopt a tactic of continuous process improvement, similar to that espoused in Kaizen, total quality management, and Lean Six Sigma. This further discourages innovation and perpetuates low value programs and work teams that should be eliminated altogether rather than \\"improved\\". Because most preventable \\"safety\\" mishaps are caused by human factors (83% of Fiscal Year 2007 Air Force major mishap costs due to human factors per AF Safety Center)Catalog of Air Force Statistics by Aircraft Type, considered typical for US Military and can be traced to human cultural and behavioral issues, according to DSP, safety can and should uniquely apply a \\"disruptive\\" solution set to addressing the issues. Such a disruptive, iterative approach may not be appropriate in otherwise hardware-centric, large budget programs, such an aircraft procurement and production. To address the safety cultural issues associated with mishap prevention in a large bureaucracy, Air National Guard safety directorate pursued a disruptive approach in requirement definition, problem identification, solution vetting, funding, and procurement. Using Boyd's Observe, Orient, Decide, Act OODA Loop to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the process, DSP was created. However, taking on a bureaucracy is not without its downside. Fiefdoms and stovepipes within the system attempt to protect their \\"turf\\" and \\"lanes\\" with rules, regulations, and non-stop administrative delays and paperwork. All this requires commitment to a long-term solution set, while constantly changing the solution itself in order to work through the bureaucratic hurdles. The DSP approach is both persistent and adaptive, which makes it entrepreneurial, according to Christopher Gergen and Gregg Vanourek in their article \\"Fending off the Recession with 'Adaptive Persistence'\\", published in the Harvard Business Review, April 2009. They write... \\"Persistence is about refusing to give up even in the face of adversity. Adaptation is about shortening the time to success through ingenuity and flexibility. 'Adaptive persistence' entails alternating between anticipation, changing course, and sticking with it, deftly navigating that paradox with aplomb.\\"Adaptive Persistence article from HBR Basic process The \\"process\\" is executed similar to a venture capitalist's portfolio of projects in that the team invests small amounts of resources in many disruptive ideas. Steps in the process are not rigorous and may be eliminated, combined, or reordered as appropriate to the desired outcome. Then the team assesses initial demonstrations and validations (DEM/VAL) of those solutions, choosing only to fully develop those that show success and return on the investment. Within the simplified OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) model, step 1 would be observe, steps 2 and 3 combine to form orient, steps 4 and 5 are decide, and step 6 is act. Essentially DSP is a six-step process that runs counter to the military mantra of \\"requirements driven\\", which is backwards-looking, and focuses instead on projecting future market needs that will eventually become formal requirements, but not currently identified as such. This is accomplished by looking at front-line problem solving activity and scaling these solutions up. These six steps, when applied rapidly, can get ahead of recognition, providing viable solutions at the point and time of need: 1\\\\. POLL FIELD‚ÄîIDEA MINING: use network of professionals at the field unit level to identify best practice mishap prevention, education, mishap investigation, procurement, and other tools. Project unpublished requirements by including end-use customers in the idea mining process. Look for full and partial solutions. 2\\\\. CONSOLIDATE / RACK AND STACK: Heuristically sort list of ideas into groups based on resource requirements, proven record, technology leveraging, mission accomplishment, Department of Defense, Air Force Instruction, and National Guard Bureau identified needs. Based on chosen development cycles, monthly, quarterly, etc., rank order all projects based on overall value to the force using DSP assessment algorithm (citation forthcoming after public release of algorithm). 3\\\\. ELIMINATE BAD FITS: Scrub the list for those items requiring major hardware, Air Force Major Command level funding, or other special, difficult to acquire funding or processes. Enterprise-level and/or exquisite programs are anathema to this innovative process. Additionally remove from consideration solutions that duplicate or compete directly with future programmed or existing military programs unless the cost savings is significant. Eliminate those programs that are not scalable in scope. 4\\\\. SELECT AND DEM/VAL: Consider resource requirements and rapidly source field unit funding or headquarters seed monies in the sub-$50K range to perform a limited DEM/VAL of concept. Many technology solutions can be demonstrated with little or no initial funding. Air National Guard Safety office has a presentation on creative funding without a budget. Use rapid contracting mechanisms through government contracting office, primarily employing SBA set- asides, blanket purchase agreements, or previously procured assets that may be re-roled into current use. This requires expert contracting officers and staff who possess training in performing basic functions of government contracting officer representative, or contracting officer technical representative. The key is to remove barriers to execution that typically delay other military efforts. 5\\\\. ITERATE FOR RESULTS: Establish definition of success at the outset. Measurable and reportable. Demonstrate measurable results within six months and seek further external and scalable funding from sources such as DARPA, Defense Safety Oversight Council (DSOC), other services, other government agencies, etc. Match requirements to resources and solutions. 6\\\\. LEAD AND MARKET: lead the effort on behalf of the United States Department of Defense, Joint, Interagency, etc. and tighten the OODA loop down to nothing. Essentially creating an agile, continuous loop so tight, Boyd might describe it as an OODA Point. Market the solution intensely and seek buy in by returning the solution to same experts that initially proposed it. Identify capable project leaders to run with the project. REPEAT PROCESS. History and program successes DSP was initiated during OIF in 2004, when a joint, interagency team, led by then-Major Edward Vaughan and then-Major Cameron Guthrie, created Project BLACK MOUNTAIN. The project evolved from a combined requirement to better share real-time tactical data among ground and air forces, as well as promote mid-air collision avoidance (MACA) within the area of responsibility (AOR). This project, which is no longer classified, assembled an ad hoc tactical datalink using in situ components within an Internet Protocol-normalized network throughout United States Central Command's AOR. Data from otherwise incompatible systems was shared in near real time using data packet conversion methods, developed on location. BLACK MOUNTAIN provided a viable fill in the gaps left by the dismantled Battlefield Universal Gateway Equipment (BUG-E) gateway solution by distributing a redundant, universal concept of operations to remote stations. The disruptive and austere nature of the solution project, and its unexpected and rapid success, led to creation of DSP as one way of streamlining bureaucracy in both combat non-combat environments. More recently, DSP has been used in the ANG and USAF to create and field mishap prevention programs. Safety programs created, executed, or developed using DSP: SEE AND AVOID ‚Äì Joint DOD and Interagency with AOPA, EAA, and FAA. It is a web based civilian-military midair collision avoidance program created by then-Lt Col Ed Vaughan and led by ANG Safety directorate from 2005 to 2009, considered a best practice. ACC is partner; AFCENT asked for Iraq, Afghanistan coverage, now under contract, currently led and funded by FAA and ANG.See And Avoid WingmanDay.org: Originally fielded as RealBase across the Air National Guard...this Comprehensive Commander‚Äôs Toolkit identifies safety issues, resiliency subject matter, and provides tools for commanders, leaders, and care practitioners to address; created by ANG Safety directorate after 2007 Safety Stand Down Day to provide ONE STOP SHOPPING for commanders and leaders. The RealBase web portal ran through 2009, when IT officials at the National Guard Bureau suspended it. In 2011, the program was relaunched as Wingman Day. The Air Force Safety Center took the RealBase Toolkit concept and developed one-stop-shopping online tool kits hosted on the secure Air Force Portal. Maintenance Resource Management (MRM): Joint DOD-wide. Originated by Lt Col Doug Slocum (AZ ANG) --see Maintenance Resource Management. ANG included it in DSP and took it DOD- wide with ANG and DOD funding...now Air Force program mandated by Air Force Instruction 21‚Äì101. Air Force Safety Center will propose way ahead on ORM revitalization & role of CRM / MRM. FlyAwake: ANG-wide, soon to be DOD-wide Joint Service. 201 Airlift Squadron (DC ANG), under command of Col Woody Akins, originated the basic concept for a web-based fatigue risk management tool which returns quantitative fatigue analysis for given flight schedule. This tool was based on the algorithm contained within FAST. Under direction of program manager Captain Lynn Lee, the ANG integrated it into the DSP and took it ANG-wide, then DOD-wide.Fly Awake, User-Friendly Fatigue Assessment and Mitigation Wingman Project: The Wingman Project was created by Lt Col Edward Vaughan, chief of aviation safety at the Air National Guard in August 2007. Wingman Project is an ANG suicide intervention initiative that SHOWS, not tells, family and friends of distressed Airmen how to intervene to save a life, using a validated model known as ACE (Ask, Care, Escort). The Wingman Project provides training and awareness through media outreach in 54 U.S. states and territories.The Wingman Project ANG AFCAST (online safety cultural survey) was the first Air National Guard variant of AFCAST. Dr. (Lt Col) Tracy Dillinger developed AFCAST for the US Air Force. In 2006/2007, Air National Guard provided key funding to the Air Force Safety Center to keep the AFCAST program viable. In return, a customized cultural tool for ANG, called ANG AFCAST was developed in 2006/2007 by the Chief of ANG Flight Safety in collaboration with Dr. Bob Figlock. The Defense Safety Oversight Council later funded the Joint Safety Climate Assessment System, under the leadership of Col Don White. ANG adopted JSCAS in lieu of ANG AFCAST based on better effectiveness. JSCAS and Joint MRM were briefed together in 2007 by ANG Safety officers to the Chief of the Navy Safety Center at Norfolk as complementary programs. Used to assess unit cultural issues and target solutions to the base needs. JSCAS dBird bird mortality model.

She was the only child of Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley, and Margaret de Lisle, 3rd Baroness Lisle. With her father's death in 1417, Elizabeth and her husband Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, became involved in an inheritance dispute with her cousin James Berkeley, initiating one of the longest lawsuits in English history. Marriage and issue Elizabeth de Berkeley was the only child born to Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley, by his wife Margaret de Lisle, 3rd Baroness Lisle. As such, Elizabeth was their sole heir, and was to inherit the baronies of Lisle and Tyes from her mother. Margaret died near 1392, but Elizabeth did not succeed to them until the death of Thomas in 1417, as he held the lands by tenure of courtesy. In September 1392, the Baron Berkeley negotiated Elizabeth's marriage to Richard de Beauchamp, eldest son and heir to Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick. Elizabeth married him sometime before 5 October 1397, and became the Countess of Warwick in 1403. The marriage remained unconsummated for at least six years. Elizabeth gave birth to three girls: #Lady Margaret Beauchamp (1404 ‚Äì 1467/1468); married John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury #Lady Eleanor Beauchamp (c. 1408 ‚Äì 1467); married (1) Thomas de Ros, 8th Baron de Ros (2) Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset (3) Walter Rokesley #Lady Elizabeth Beauchamp (c. 1417 ‚Äì died before 2 October 1480); married (1) George Neville, 1st Baron Latimer (2) Thomas Wake Inheritance dispute Berkeley Castle (as seen in present day), part of the dispute between the Countess and her cousin Elizabeth's level of education and literacy is evident from a 1410 commission asking John Walton to translate Boethius' De consolatione philosophiae; he dedicated it in her name. An inheritance dispute erupted with her father's death in 1417. Thomas had named her his heir, but many of his lands and estates, including Berkeley Castle, were entailed through the male line to Elizabeth's cousin James Berkeley. Elizabeth and her husband refused to accept the entail, thus \\"initiat[ing] one of the longest lawsuits in England,\\" which lasted until 1609. After Lord Thomas' death, the Earl and Countess of Warwick quickly took control of the castle and gained the temporary permission of King Henry V to maintain it. James was unable to seize control of the castle, as Warwick and the king were then fighting in France. To gain support in the dispute, Elizabeth sought the help of John, Duke of Bedford while James successfully bribed Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, each one of the king's brothers. By 1425, Elizabeth was dead and James had been given Berkeley Castle along with most of the entailed lands. Elizabeth died on 28 December 1422. She was buried at Kingswood Abbey, and a marble tomb was later placed over her grave through a provision in her husband's will. The following year, the Earl of Warwick remarried to Lady Isabel le Despenser, the widow of his cousin Richard de Beauchamp, 1st Earl of Worcester.

The Way of the Five Pecks of Rice () or the Way of the Celestial Master, commonly abbreviated to simply The Celestial Masters, was a Chinese Taoist movement founded by the first Celestial Master Zhang Daoling in 142 CE. At its height, the movement controlled a theocratic state in the Hanzhong valley, north of Sichuan. In 215 CE, the state was incorporated into Cao Cao's Kingdom of Wei, and the followers of the Celestial Master were dispersed all over China. The Celestial Masters believed that qi pervaded everything, and in order to achieve immortality, the correct balance of qi had to be present within the body. Having a poor quantity of qi in the body, would result in illness, and eventually death. Meditation could be used to restore qi to the body, but sex was to be avoided, as it could result in the loss of qi. If there was the correct balance of qi within the body upon death, an adherent could 'feign death' and be reborn. If not, an adherent would be transported to an earthly prison where he would face eternal torment. The Hanzhong state was divided into 24 regions which were led by an official. Each district had a civil register which recorded people's names and ranks. Three times a year, the registers were updated at the same time as an important feast. While a child's rank rose automatically, adults had to raise their own rank through religious achievement or marriage. Higher ranked people had more divine generals at their command, which could be used to fight demons that caused bad luck or disease. The state had a system of law that encouraged confession and benevolence rather than strict punishment. Criminals were asked to confess their crimes and meditate, and were given public work to do as a sentence. Few texts written by the Hanzhong Celestial Masters survive, with the most important being the Xiang'er commentary to the Dao De Jing. While the Hanzhong state lasted for only twenty-five years, their beliefs influenced all subsequent Daoist movements. History In 142 CE Zhang Daoling announced that Laozi had appeared to him and commanded him to rid the world of decadence and establish a new state consisting only of the ‚Äòchosen people.‚Äô Zhang became the first Celestial Master, and began to spread his newly founded movement throughout the province of Sichuan. The movement was initially called the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice, because each person wishing to join was required to donate five pecks of rice (actually five d«íu, equal to 13.6 US gallons or 5.9 pecks).Hendrischke (2000), 139. The movement spread rapidly, particularly under his son Zhang Heng (ÂºµË°°) and grandson Zhang Lu.Hendrischke (2000), 140. The Zhangs were able to convert many groups to their cause, such as the Bandun Man (belonging to the Ba people), which strengthened their movement.Kleeman (1998), 74. In 184, Zhang Xiu(ÂºµËÑ©, not related to Zhang Lu) rebelled against the Han Dynasty. In 191, Zhang Lu and Zhang Xiu were sent to conquer the Hanzhong valley, just north of Sichuan, which was under Su Gu's c (ËòáÂõ∫)ontrol.Bokenkamp (1997), 34. During the subsequent battle, Zhang Xiu was killed, and Zhang Lu founded the theocratic state of Zhanghan, enjoying full independence.Hendrischke (2000), 140.Bokenkamp (1997), 34. In 215, Cao Cao, the ruler of the Kingdom of Wei attacked the Hanzhong state, and forced Zhang Lu to flee to Eastern Sichuan, where he later surrendered.Kleeman (1998), 76. Zhang was given a title and land, as were several other family members and generals.Robinet (1997), 55. His followers were forced to resettle in other parts of China, with one group being sent to the Chang'an area, and another being sent to Luoyang. Zhang and his family relocated to Cao Cao's administrative headquarters in Ye, located in today's Hebei and Henan provinces.Kleeman (1998), 77. He then used his own popularity as a religious leader to lend legitimacy to the Wei, proclaiming that the Wei court had inherited divine authority from the Daoist church, as well as from Confucian laws. Shortly after the surrender, Zhang Lu died and was succeeded by his son, Fu. After this point there are few historical sources until 255 CE, when a text indicates that the Celestial Master community was fragmenting as a result of the political turmoil within the Wei KingdomKleeman (1998), 78.Bokenkamp (1997), 4. The collapse of the Kingdom of Wei in 260 CE, along with the fall of Northern China to the Huns in 317, further scattered adherents to the Celestial Master.Bokenkamp (1997), 150. The Celestial Masters later reemerged in the 4th and 5th centuries as two distinct offshoots, the Northern and Southern Celestial Masters.See Nickerson (2000) and Kohn (2000). Zhang Daoling, the first Celestial Master Texts The only significant Celestial Master text that survives from the Hanzhong period is the Xiang'er commentary to the Dao De Jing. This text gives insight into the Celestial Masters‚Äô physiological beliefs, meditation practices and rituals. In addition, the commentary reinterprets the Dao De Jing to have all of humanity as its intended audience, instead of only a sage.Bokenkamp (1997), 3. The Taiping Jing, a text attributed to the Yellow Turbans, was not a Celestial Master text, but reflects at least in part some Celestial Master thought and practice.Robinet (1997), 70. A later text written in 255 CE, known as the Commands and Admonitions for the Families of the Great Dao was composed to a divided Celestial Master community after the dispersal of the Hanzhong population. While written in the persona of Zhang Lu, it is probable that this text was not written by him, as he had probably died by 255 CE.Bokenkamp (1997), 4. Beliefs and practices The Celestial Masters believed that there was an upcoming apocalypse that would nearly destroy humanity. Only 18,000 adherents of the Celestial Master who had the right balance of qi would survive the disaster. These were the seed people that would repopulate the earth after the destruction.Kleeman (1998), 73. Qi The foundation of Celestial Master belief is that there is an energy source known as qi, that is born from the Dao and is the source of life all things. The human body contains spirits that need to be nourished by the proper balance of qi.Bokenkamp (1997), 41-42. There are three types of qi: yin qi, yang qi and blended qi, which is mixed yin/yang qi.Bokenkamp (1997), 43. The goal of a Daoist is to achieve transcendence to a higher plane. In order to do this, they must preserve and harmonize their internal spirits. Only through meditation that guides qi correctly throughout the body, can the spirits be harmonized correctly. While it is known that the Celestial Masters meditated in order to obtain qi, there is no surviving evidence that describes their meditation practices.Bokenkamp (1997), 41. Immortality One common goal of early Daoism was to extend life by achieving immortality.Penny (2000), 109. The Celestial Masters believed that in order to achieve immortality, one was not supposed to extend life in the current world, but rather 'feign death' in this world, and be reborn on the other side. In order to feign death, an adept had to have perfectly harmonized internal spirits. When someone with refined internal spirits died in this world, their spirit would venture to the Palace of Grand Darkness where their form would be refined and then reborn in a perfected state on the other side. There are no surviving texts that describe what kind of place the 'other side' was. Those that failed to harmonize their internal spirits prior to death would be reborn in the underground earth- prisons, where they would be subject to eternal torment and toil.Bokenkamp (1997), 47. Illness In the Hanzhong community, everyone was regarded as ill in some way.Bokenkamp (1997), 35. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body, and qi was necessary for life. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring that the loss of qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and kowtowing to heaven.Tsuchiya (2002), 46.Hendrischke (1997), 154. Illness could be cured in other ways as well, such as using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music.Robinet (1997), 73. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only of noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.Robinet (1997), 73-74. Sexuality Practicing correct sexual practices was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is the embodiment of qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened.Bokenkamp (1997), 44. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex for the purposes of reproduction.Bokenkamp (1997), 45. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non- ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced.Bokenkamp (1997), 83. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.Bokenkamp (1997), 45. See Kalinowski (1985) for a full description of the ritual. Organization The region governed by the Celestial Masters was divided into 24 regions for both administrative and religious reasons. Each of these 24 regions were connected with one of the Five Phases, one of the 24 periods of the year and with one of the 28 constellations of the zodiac. Depending on their birth signs, each adherent belonged to one of these districts. Each of the 24 regions was administered by 24 officials, who had under their command 240 armies of spirits, composed of 2400 generals, 2400 officers and 240000 soldiers. This system of administration reflected the utopian system of governance described in the Zhouli.Robinet (1997), 56-57. Administration and religion were closely linked in the system of the Celestial Masters. Adherents were grouped by families, and each was attached to a district. Families and districts, and the gods all held copies of civil registers.Robinet (1997), 57. The registers were detailed records of the people, and recorded each person's rank, identity and location.Kleeman (1998), 72. Any changes to those registered had to be accompanied by a monetary contribution known as a 'wage of faith.' Requests to the gods followed a bureaucratic model, and were drawn up according to specific administrative codes. The effectiveness of these requests depended upon the accuracy of the registers kept by the gods.Robinet (1997), 57. New members of the sect were divided into groups led by instructors. Neophytes were instructed by a catechism similar to that found in the Xiang'er that was likely a type of proto-meditation that later became widespread in movements such as the Shangqing School of Daoism. These instructors handled religious and administrative duties, receiving taxes, and set up road-side inns for travelers.Robinet (1997), 57-58. The rank of each person was determined by how many divine generals they had at their disposal, and by the number of divine scriptures they had obtained.Kleeman (1998), 72. These divine generals were used to fight wandering demons that could bring misfortune or illness on someone.Kleeman (1998), 75. A person received their first general at the age of six years, and in subsequent ceremonies would be given more and generals and achieve a higher ranking until a full complement was achieved at the age of nineteen.Kleeman (1998), 72. Marriage would unite two sets of generals, thus giving a couple use of 150 divine generals. After marriage, further increases in ranking could only be achieved by religious achievement. On certain dates of the year, such as the equinoxes, group ceremonies took place at which masters disseminated their teachings. During these ceremonies, communal feasts often took place, where food was eaten and offered to the gods. The feasts also took place when a birth or death occurred, or in order to bring happiness and prevent evil. The participants in such a feast were organized based on their religious standing, with merit and seniority being the determining factors. Robinet (1997), 59. During the three important dates known as Sanyuan, the most important feasts were held. During these thrice- annual feasts, a census would be taken recording births, deaths and peoples' movements.Kleeman (1998), 72. At this time, adherents were also expected to donate the five pecks of rice that gives the movement its name.Bokenkamp (1997), 36. Law In the Hanzhong state, sin and criminal behavior were not differentiated. In order to eliminate sin, an adherent first had to acknowledge his crime, and then would have to go to a 'quiet room' to meditate. There, he would have to write three confessions which would be offered to the Lord of Heaven, the Lord of Earth and the Lord of Water.Kleeman (1998), 70. For public crimes, an accused would be pardoned three times for his actions and then be sentenced. A sentence depended on the type of crime, but always involved community service. For a minor crime, the sentence was usually to repair a road. A repeat offender might be asked to donate building materials to improve local buildings. Other laws banned alcohol and prohibited the killing of animals during the spring and summer.Kleeman (1998), 71. Legacy The belief and practices of the Hanzhong Celestial Masters had a profound legacy upon future Daoist belief. The movement marked a significant change from earlier, philosophical Daoist movements. No longer was Daoism a philosophical pastime for the literate and wealthy; it was now promoted to all classes of society, including the illiterate and the non-Chinese. In addition, the Celestial Masters were the first Daoist group to form an organized priesthood that helped spread their beliefs. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the first Celestial Masters are the ancestors of all subsequent Daoist movements such as the Shangqing and Lingbao movements, as well as the medieval Zhengyi Daoists, who claimed affinity to the first Celestial Masters.Bokenkamp (1997), 14.

He served as Los Angeles City Attorney from 2009 to 2013. PRIDE 2010 Parade Biography Trutanich grew up in San Pedro where he attended elementary and high school. Trutanich went on to attend the University of Southern California where he obtained a bachelor's degree in Business Administration with an emphasis in Accounting and Business Management. Trutanich earned his MBA from the University of Southern California where he was a member of Phi Delta Theta. After obtaining his MBA, he worked in the tuna industry as a laborer for StarKist FDS, ultimately working his way up to a management position at his plant. Trutanich attended night school at South Bay University College of Law, graduating with a Juris Doctor in 1978. He worked as a prosecutor on behalf of Los Angeles County before forming his own firm. Trutanich is a founding partner of the law firm Trutanich & Michel. He is the father of Nicholas A. Trutanich, the United States Attorney for the District of Nevada since January 16, 2019. Los Angeles City Attorney Election In 2009, Trutanich won the runoff election, succeeding Rocky Delgadillo as Los Angeles' City Attorney by defeating Jack Weiss and winning the 2009 Los Angeles City Attorney Election on May 19, 2009. His campaign received endorsements from the Los Angeles Times, the Los Angeles Daily News, and the Daily Breeze, among other publications. His term began on July 1, 2009. Tenure In 2010, Trutanich proposed a series of reforms to streamline the Workers Compensation process. An audit showed that it previously took an average of 5.8 years to settle such cases, and Trutanich said that the program was \\"in disarray.\\" Trutanich established a new peer review process to attempt to better settle such cases, and assigned seven new attorneys to the Workers Compensation division. Campaign for Los Angeles District Attorney Trutanich formally declared his candidacy for Los Angeles County District Attorney on February 9, 2012. He was called a front runner based on his lead in fundraising and endorsements. Trutanich received endorsements from Sheriff Lee Baca and former opponent Mario Trujillo. Trutanich's decision to run drew criticism from opponents in the race as well as a staff editorial in the Los Angeles Times. The controversy stems from Trutanich's 2008‚Äì09 campaign for City Attorney during which Trutanich promised to serve two full terms as City Attorney. Trutanich's candidacy for District Attorney is three years into his first four-year term as City Attorney. In 2008, Trutanich challenged his opponent for City Attorney, Jack Weiss, to sign a pledge stating that he would serve two full terms as City Attorney and not seek higher elected office. Under the terms of the pledge signed by Trutanich, if he did not serve two full terms as City Attorney he would have to take out a full page advertisement in the Los Angeles Times stating \\"I am a liar\\" and donate $100,000 to LA's Best After School Enrichment Program, which serves 28,000 students at 186 elementary school sites in Los Angeles. In January 2012, Trutanich listed several law enforcement organizations as supporters who endorsed his candidacy. As the L.A. Times reported, the organizations had not actually endorsed Trutanich. The campaign apologized and removed the organizations from its list of endorsements. In February 2012 Trutanich's campaign claimed \\"broad support‚Ä¶from a vast online and grass-roots audience\\" based on one of Trutanich's promotional video receiving hundreds of thousands of views online. After media attention, the campaign disclosed that it paid a marketing firm to generate many of those views. On Monday April 9, 2012, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Joseph Kalin characterized Trutanich's decision to call himself \\"Los Angeles chief prosecutor\\" on the June election ballot as an attempt to mislead voters and Judge Kalin prohibited Trutanich from using that term or any misleading variations of it. While Judge Kalin prohibited Trutanich from using the terms \\"Chief Prosecutor\\" or \\"Chief Criminal Prosecutor\\", Kalin did allow Trutanich to refer to himself as \\"Los Angeles City Prosecutor.\\" Trutanich was defeated for re-election on May 21 by Mike Feuer.

Together with the smaller Dragon LNG terminal it can handle up to 25% of the UK's gas requirement. The first tanker docked on 20 March 2009. History The project was announced in April 2003. The terminal was located at the former Esso refinery at South Hook. Description The terminal is built to store and re-gasify liquefied natural gas imported from the Qatargas 2 LNG plant in Qatar. in the five storage tanks located onsite. The large tanks are each 94 metres in diameter and 31 metres high, rising another 12 metres to the top. This makes a tank's volume roughly equivalent to that of Albert Hall. The regasified natural gas is to be fed through the South Wales Gas Pipeline to the national gas network at Tirley, Gloucestershire. Project company The terminal is owned and operated by the South Hook LNG Terminal Company Ltd, a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum LNG Services (QG II) Ltd. (67.5%), ExxonMobil Qatargas (II) Terminal Company Ltd. (24.15%) and ELF Petroleum UK Limited (8.35%). Construction The terminal was designed and built by CB&I.; At construction peak, some 2,500 people were employed on site. Despite starting work some 3 months later than the nearby Dragon LNG terminal (which has two LNG tanks compared to the 5 at South Hook), South Hook was the first of the two to receive LNG and send natural gas into the national gas network. The site slopes down towards the River Cleddau. This allowed the tanks to be located such that they cannot be seen from the Milford Haven ‚Äì Dale road that runs north along the terminal. Controversy Droning and vibration from the Qatargas Q-Flex and Q-Max vessels also cause noise nuisance to local residents who have formed a community group to pressure the South Hook LNG Terminal and Qatargas to comment on the issue. A trial of new exhaust silencers has been implemented but they are not producing a significant improvement in low level frequency mitigation. Because of the long running noise and vibration issues local communities are forming a number of pressure groups to encourage the South Hook Terminal, Qatargas and regulatory Authorities to carry out further assessments and enforcement. These groups claim the aim is not to try to close the terminal down, but to encourage a better integration into the community by using quiet ships. There is an ongoing controversy over the safety of the site spearheaded by the Safe Haven group. It is claimed by Safe Haven that in case of gas ignition, it could endanger twenty thousand lives and that there are concerns that sufficient risk assessments had not been carried out into the possibility of a collision or major incident at the port. Contracts The main source of cargoes to the terminal is from trains No. 4 and 5 of the Qatargas 2 project in Ras Laffan, Qatar. These are jointly owned by Qatar Petrolium and ExxonMobil. The initial GSPA signed in 2005 was for 15.6 million tonnes per year, but this was reduced to 10.4 million tonnes per year in 2009 when Total acquired a 16.7-percent share in one of the Qatargas 2 trains. In 2014, RasGas and Eon struck a deal for 2 BCM of gas to be delivered into either the IOG terminal or South Hook (likely the IOG) over a four-year period. This was the first deal to be struck by the sister company of Qatargas for deliveries into the UK ‚Äì as previously the two companies kept their markets very much separate.

Biography Marie de Lorraine de Guise was a \\"foreign princess naturalized in France\\" (that is, the daughter of a foreign prince of a junior branch of the House of Lorraine). After the death of the last male of the House of Guise in 1675, Marie became duchess of Guise, duchess of Joyeuse, and princess of Joinville and enjoyed the vast revenues from these duchies and principalities.Marie de Guise (1615-1688), French wikipedia. People addressed her formally as \\"Your Highness\\"; she signed legal documents as \\"Marie de Lorraine\\"; and after 1675, as \\"Marie de Lorraine de Guise\\", but she ended personal letters with \\"Guise\\". Exiled to Florence with her family, 1634‚Äì43,Patricia M. Ranum, Portraits around Marc-Antoine Charpentier (Baltimore, 2004), pp. 353-58 Marie (whom the French knew as \\"Mademoiselle de Guise\\") became close to the Medicis and came to love Italy and especially Italian music. For over forty years scarcely a week passed that she did not write to her Medici friends in Florence, or receive word from them through the Tuscan resident in Paris. Circa 1650 she morganatically married Claude de Bourdeille, count of Montr√©sor Ranum, Portraits, pp. 360-62 by whom she had several children whose existence was never acknowledged publicly but whom she occasionally threatened to acknowledge if she did not get her way. As guardian for her nephew, Louis Joseph, Duke of Guise, she was preoccupied with returning the House of Guise to its former glory. This meant giving the young man a fine residence and a prestigious bride. In 1666 Marie therefore commissioned Jacques Gabriel (the father of royal architect Jacques Gabriel) to carry out extensive renovations for the family's urban residence, known as the H√¥tel de Guise. She also ordered a total reworking of the garden by the famous garden designer, Andr√© Le N√¥tre. The old stable wing that stretched along the garden was also renovated and subdivided into comfortable apartments to be occupied by what might be likened to today's artists and intellectuals in residence: Philippe Goibaut, Roger de Gaigni√®res, and, a bit later, Marc-Antoine Charpentier. For a bride, Marie de Lorraine aimed high and was victorious: Elisabeth d'Orl√©ans, Louis XIV's first cousin, whose high rank outweighed the unsightliness of her crooked back. The marriage was celebrated on 5 May 1667. The newly-weds settled down into their splendid apartment on the \\"noble\\" floor of the H√¥tel de Guise and Marie de Lorraine lodged in her ground-floor apartment just below them. Starting in 1670, Marc-Antoine Charpentier began composing for the three Guises, sometimes singing haute-contre lines. Mlle de Guise protected him and advanced his career by soliciting commissions from people or establishments who were seeking her continued patronage. Indeed, for eighteen years her patronage fostered a number of major works, most of them devotional and strongly influenced by Italian music.The Guises as Patrons (Patricia Ranum) ; and Patricia M. Ranum, \\"Un 'Foyer d'italianisme' chez les Guises: quelques r√©flexions sur les oratorios de Charpentier,\\" Marc-Antoine Charpentier, un musicien retrouv√©, ed. Catherine Cessac (Sprimont: Mardaga, 2005), pp.85-110. For example, she was probably one of the \\"enraged virgins\\" and \\"heroines\\" who swooped down on Moli√®re in late 1672 and forced him to give Charpentier the chance to write the music for Moli√®re's the forthcoming theatrical spectacle, the Malade Imaginaire. In 1671 her nephew Louis Joseph, Duke of Guise died. She and the young widow fought over who would be guardian of the late Duke's little son, Fran√ßois Joseph, the last male of the House of Guise. Marie de Lorraine won the battle, but her guardianship was short-lived. The little boy died in 1675. Henceforth, as the last member of the House of Guise, she used her vast wealth not only to live splendidly but for projects dear to her heart.Ranum, Portraits, pp. 426ff In a cartouche beneath her portrait by Mignard, above, a solitary tree stands in a forest of stumps, to indicate her position as last survivor. A Latin motto makes the parallel explicit: Succisas dat conjectare superstes, \\"The survivor bears witness to the fallen.\\" After these two closely spaced deaths, Marie turned to devotion. With the help of Father Nicolas Barr√©, Minim, she founded a teachers' training institute and created schools for girls and hospitals for the poor in her Parisian parish and in her provincial lands. In her vast Parisian residence known as the \\"H√¥tel de Guise,\\" she presided \\"magnificently\\" over a select little \\"court\\" composed chiefly of members of the House of Lorraine, clergy, learned prot√©g√©s, and Italians passing through Paris. Music (often Italian and Italian-style music) was the principal entertainment at these events. Although her relations were often frosty with Louis Joseph's widow, known to her contemporaries as \\"Madame de Guise\\", the two women continued to see one another, both in Paris and at the abbey of Saint Pierre de Montmartre, where Marie's sister Ren√©e was abbess and where √âlisabeth's sister, Marguerite Louise d'Orl√©ans, the erstwhile Grand Duchess of Tuscany, resided after 1675. Both Guise women had private apartments at Montmartre. In the early 1670s, Marie had begun to assemble a small ensemble of household musicians to perform pieces by a variety of French and Italian composers, among them Marc-Antoine Charpentier.Patricia M. Ranum, \\"A sweet servitude, A musician's life at the court of Mlle de Guise,\\" Early Music, 15 (1987), pp. 347-360. Among the musicians was √âtienne Louli√©, pedagogue and theorist, who collaborated with Marc-Antoine Charpentier on the musical education of Philippe d'Orl√©ans, R√©gent of France. Then, in the early 1680s she enlarged the group, until it rivaled both in size and quality the ensembles maintained by \\"several sovereigns.\\" Over the years she made her composer and her musicians available to her nephew's widow, Mme de Guise, for performances in churches and at the royal court. In a will intended to disinherit her niece,Patricia M.

While both \\"tooth\\" and \\"tail\\" soldiers may find themselves in combat or other life-threatening situations, \\"tooth\\" soldiers are those whose primary function is to neutralize the enemy. The ratio is not a specific measure but rather a general indication of an army's actual military might in relation to the resources it devotes to supply, upkeep, and logistics. Description An army's tooth-to-tail ratio is often inversely related to its technological capabilities and subsequently its overall power. While an army with a high tooth-to-tail ratio will have more personnel devoted to combat, these soldiers will lack the support provided by the tail. Such support includes the supply and communication infrastructure on which modern armies depend. An army with a higher tooth-to-tail ratio may have more combat troops, but each will be less effective. The tooth-to-tail ratio of the US military has varied widely in its different conflicts. The introduction of computer technology has made automation of the tail a possibility. One of the stated goals of DARPA is increasing the tooth-to-tail ratio (reducing the amount of logistics and support personnel necessary in proportion to combat personnel) without reducing combat effectiveness.

Constructed between 1873 and 1875, the building was the first constructed for the Indiana Normal School. In 1903, the building was named after John Sutton, the first president of the school's Board of Trustees. Sutton Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. History John Sutton, a merchant from Indiana, Pennsylvania, purchased land to establish a normal school to train women to become teachers. In 1873, construction of the building began. The Main Building was designed by James W. Drum, who also designed the original Indiana County Courthouse and the St. Bernard's Roman Catholic Church. Construction was completed in 1875 with a final cost of $141,115, including furnishings.Guidebook, pg. 2 In the school's early years the building functioned as the entire school, containing classrooms, dormitories, an infirmary, a dining hall, and a gymnasium. In 1903, the building was officially named after Sutton. That same year, the north and south wings were extended to the west, and Thomas Sutton Dining Hall was added adjacent to the main building.Guidebook, pg. 3 In 1920, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania assumed control of the school. The name was changed to Indiana (PA) State Teacher's College in 1927. It became Indiana State College in 1959. The college achieved university status in 1965 and became Indiana University of Pennsylvania. As more buildings at the school were constructed, activities were decentralized from Sutton Hall. Sutton Hall was originally scheduled for renovations in the 1970s, but the Pennsylvania Department of Education advised that available funds would be insufficient to support the renovation and the $16 million library the university was planning. The decision to demolish the building was made in 1974. The Committee to Save John Sutton Hall was organized and funded a feasibility study by Landmarks Planning, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who specialized in the restoration of old buildings. The study concluded that the building could be restored and continue to benefit the university economically. On September 19, 1975, the President of the Board of Trustees received a letter from the Director of the Office of Historic Preservation stating that Sutton Hall had been included on the National Register of Historic Places on September 17. Inclusion on the Register made grants available for the renovation project. Just weeks later on October 3, the Board of Trustees unanimously voted to preserve Sutton Hall.Restoration, pg. 4 Gallery Works *A Guidebook to John Sutton Hall.

Sparks, 449 U.S. 24 (1980), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that individuals who bribed a judge for an injunction were not protected by judicial immunity and therefore could be held liable for the damages resulting from the injunction.. The case In January 1973, a judge of the 229th District Court of Duval County, Tex., enjoined the production of minerals from certain oil leases owned by respondents. In June 1975, the injunction was dissolved by an appellate court as having been illegally issued. Respondents then filed a complaint in the United States District Court purporting to state a cause of action for damages under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983.. Defendants were the Duval County Ranch Co., Inc., which had obtained the injunction, the sole owner of the corporation, the judge who entered the injunction, and the two individual sureties on the injunction bond, one of whom is now petitioner in this Court. Essentially, the claim was that the injunction had been corruptly issued as the result of a conspiracy between the judge and the other defendants, thus causing a deprivation of property, i.e., two years of oil production, without due process of law. All defendants moved to dismiss, the judge asserting judicial immunity and the other defendants urging dismissal for failure to allege action \\"under color\\" of state law, a necessary component of a ¬ß 1983 cause of action. The District Court concluded that, because the injunction was a judicial act within the jurisdiction of the state court, the judge was immune from liability in a ¬ß 1983 suit, whether or not the injunction had issued as the result of a corrupt conspiracy. Relying on Haldane v. Chagnon, the District Court also ruled that, with the dismissal of the judge, the remaining defendants could not be said to have conspired under color of state law within the meaning of ¬ß 1983. The action against them was accordingly dismissed \\"for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\\" In a per curiam opinion, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the judge was immune from suit and that, because \\"the remaining defendants, who are all private citizens, did not conspire with any person against whom a valid ¬ß 1983 suit can be stated,\\" existing authorities in the Circuit required dismissal of the claims against these defendants as well. The case was reconsidered en banc, prior Circuit authority was overruled and the District Court judgment was reversed insofar as it had dismissed claims against the defendants other than the judge. The court ruled that there was no good reason in law, logic, or policy for conferring immunity on private persons who persuaded the immune judge to exercise his jurisdiction corruptly. Because the judgment below was inconsistent with the rulings of other Courts of Appeals and involves an important issue, the Supreme Court granted the petition for certiorari.

At some point late in the 15th century, the nearby Miyako Islands were divided between two influential families, the Nakasone and Kaneshigawa, who were fighting one another for dominance of the area. Seeking to take advantage of the chaos and disunity, Akahachi proposed an invasion of the Miyako Islands. However, Nakasone Toyomiya led a counterattack against Akahachi, overwhelming his forces and moving on to attack Yonaguni Island as well.Kerr, George. Okinawa: the History of an Island People. (revised ed.) Tokyo: Tuttle Publishing, 2000. p121. At this time, the Ryukyu Kingdom, based at Shuri on Okinawa Island, did not yet have direct control over the Yaeyama or Miyako Islands, but merely expected tribute to be paid. Akahachi led the people of Ishigaki and the surrounding islands in revolt against the kingdom, refusing to pay taxes or tribute. After Nakasone conquered Yaeyama, a force of roughly 3,000 Ryukyuan troops was sent by King Sh≈ç Shin in 1500, and the rebellion was suppressed with the annexation of the Sakishima Islands.

During the War of 1812, the island was utilized as a military field hospital for convalescent soldiers as well as both British and American casualties of the Battle of Plattsburgh. The island is the site of a mass grave believed to contain the remains of roughly 150 of those casualties. Crab Island is infamous locally for its poison ivy, which grows abundantly on the island. Its name is thought to come from the large amounts of \\"crabs\\" (referring to fossilized shells, trilobites, and other fossils) found along the island's limestone shoreline. History The naval battle Crab Island played an important role during the September 1814 Battle of Plattsburgh. On the morning of September 11, 1814, the tiny island served as the southern end of Commodore Thomas Macdonough's battle line. Macdonough had moored his ships end to end between it and Cumberland Head to the north, forming a line across the entrance to Plattsburgh Bay. Macdonough strategised that this arrangement of his warships would either force the British to engage his anchored squadron immediately after rounding Cumberland Head, which would give him the advantage, or force them to sail farther south around Crab Island at his rear. In this case, the British ships would then come within range of the guns of the American fortifications ashore. To assist in this, a battery of two cannon were also placed by the Americans on the northern tip of Crab island and were manned by a crew of convalescents from the field hospital. During the nearly two and a half hour action, an 11-gun British sloop, the H.M.S. Finch, commanded by Lieutenant William Hicks, ran hard aground on a reef just to the north-east of the island and became engaged in a fierce cannon duel with the Crab Island battery. Lieutenant Hicks would later recall that his crew \\"had the pleasure of killing or wounding every man at the guns on shore and silence them.\\"The Court Martial of Captain Daniel Pring and the Officers and Men Employed in the Squadron on Lake Champlain, August 18‚Äì21, 1815 on Board H.M.S.

The island's monument and flagpole can be seen in the enlargement to the left and right respectively. The military hospital on Crab Island was first established around September 6, 1814, just prior to the Battle of Plattsburgh. The hospital consisted mainly of rows of \\"tents\\" quickly constructed of boards and canvas and several hastily built log structures. Convalescent or invalid soldiers who were unable to fight were initially evacuated to the island before the commencement of hostilities to prevent them from becoming caught up or overrun by the fighting ashore. Many of these were later transported in bateaus from Crab Island to a larger hospital at Burlington, Vermont, across the lake. The island's hospital was placed under the direction of a U.S. Army surgeon, Doctor James Mann. At the time, the number of invalids on the general hospital reports alone numbered 720 men.Medical Sketches of the campaigns of 1812, 13, 14, by Doctor James Mann, M.D.A.A.S., pub.1816 Following the naval battle, as the nearest point of land to it, the Crab Island hospital absorbed the dead and wounded of both fleets. The dead, including those that died on the island and those that washed ashore, numbered 150. They were buried shoulder to shoulder in three long trenches to the south of the hospital.Plattsburgh Republican, Plattsburgh, New York, September 22, 1877 The bodies of officers killed in the battle, including one initially buried on Crab Island, all received military burials in Plattsburgh's Riverside Cemetery, while the enlisted men were left in the mass graves out on the island. Crab Island is purported to be one of the only places in the world where both British and American soldiers were buried indiscriminately in the same graves. The actual site of the graves on Crab Island was never marked, and the exact site of their graves has never been established. Ninety-one of the deceased are known by name.Crab Island at Find a Grave memorial Aftermath Following years of effort by numerous Plattsburgh citizens, money for a proper memorial on the island was appropriated by Congress in the early 1900s. In 1903, a iron flagstaff, designed to be reminiscent of a ship's mast, was erected. This was followed in 1908 by the construction of a granite obelisk, known as the Crab Island Soldiers and Sailors Monument, which included commemorative bronze plaques on each face. A series of inter- connecting gravel paths were cleared allowing access for visitors and a wharf was built to accommodate boats. A full-time caretaker was hired to live in a small cottage on the island and in 1909, by act of Congress, the island was officially renamed Macdonough National Military Park.The Secrets of Crab Island, James P. Millard, 2004, p.53 By 1930, the island had been mostly abandoned. The one and only caretaker had left in 1915 and the caretaker's cottage burned in 1929. The island remained mostly devoid of activity until the 1950s, when United States Air Force personnel stationed at nearby Plattsburgh Air Force Base began a project of clearing portions of the island for a base recreational area. This initiative also proved short lived. In 1967, the Government auctioned the island off as surplus property, despite the presence of graves, monuments and a National Military Cemetery. Crab Island changed private hands several times throughout the proceeding decades and was only saved from development by the efforts of a vigilant few who succeeded in changing the island's zoning regulations. Crab Island State Park In 1988, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation created Crab Island State Park after acquiring the island in order to prevent private recreational development of the site. The state had initially attempted to purchase the property in 1986, however they were outbid at that time by Roger Jakubowski, a New Jersey businessman who was actively purchasing large amounts of Adirondack property during the late 1980s. Jakubowski hoped to operate the island as a recreational venture, and planned to offer boat tours, picnic and barbecue facilities, and camping. These uses were viewed as being detrimental to the historic and cultural value of the island, and public outcry led to New York State using eminent domain to appropriate the island in January 1988. The state ultimately paid Jakubowski $210,000 for the island, $20,000 more than he spent two years prior. In 1991, Jakubowski sued New York State for $1.5 million in damages relating to the seizure of Crab Island. The case was settled in 1994 for an undisclosed amount. Although New York State has no plans to officially develop Crab Island State Park, volunteers have made progress in restoring the island's monuments and recreational features since the park's formation, including clearing the overgrown 1908 trail system. In August 2003, a dedicated group of volunteers restored and re- erected the island's unique iron flagpole, which had fallen in a windstorm in 1996. A bronze plaque placed at the foot of the flagpole memorializes the names of the American dead buried on the island.

Prosopamnesia (Greek: œÄœÅŒøœÉœâœÄŒøŒΩ = \\"face\\", Œ±ŒºŒΩŒ∑œÉŒπŒ± = forgetfulness) is a selective neurological impairment in the ability to learn new faces. There is a special neural circuit for the processing of faces as opposed to other non-face objects. Prosopamnesia is a deficit in the part of this circuit responsible for encoding perceptions as memories. Overview Prosopamnesia presents itself in patients as an inability to recognize people they have previously encountered based on their faces. In this way, it is very easily mistaken as prosopagnosia, which is an inability to perceive or recognize faces. Prosopagnosia is a deficit that occurs earlier in the neural circuit while the facial stimuli is being processed, whereas prosopamnesia takes effect when the brain attempts to encode the processed facial stimuli into memory. Because the distinction between prosopamnesia and prosopagnosia is so close in the neurological circuit, the only phenotypic difference between the two is in the breadth of faces to which a patient's symptoms apply. Prosopagnosics cannot recognize faces, even of people within their own families over the span of a lifetime. Prosopamnesiacs show a memory for facial stimuli that they learned prior to the onset of their condition (in the case of acquired prosopamnesia) or for facial stimuli that they have encountered repeatedly for long periods of time (in the case of congenital prosopamnesia). There are currently only two diagnosed cases of prosopamnesia. This is likely due to the fact that it can easily be misdiagnosed as prosopagnosia based on symptoms. Some doctors have even recognized distinctions in deficits of facial perception and facial memory encoding and classified them as subfamilies of prosopagnosia.Barton, J. J. (2003). Disorders of face perception and recognition. Neurol Clin, 21(2), 521-548. This lack of consistency within the scientific community for classifying patients with facial memory encoding deficits is one reason that prosopamnesia has such rare diagnosis. Most of the current knowledge about how prosopamnesia works within the brain is hypothesized, but not proven, due to lack of case studies. As doctors become aware of the distinction between prosopagnosia and prosopamnesia, proper and more frequent diagnosis of prosopamnesia may occur. Symptoms Symptoms of prosopamnesia may include: *Difficulty recognizing people, especially when encountered outside of the previous or familiar context *Use of non-facial cues such as hair, gait, or glasses to identify people *Requiring many times of meeting people before being able to remember their names *Trouble keeping track of characters in movies or TV shows *Social anxiety *Having a memory for the faces of people encountered before the brain damage occurred (acquired case only) Davis, J. M., McKone, E., Dennett, H., O'Connor, K. B., O'Kearney, R., & Palermo, R. (2011). Individual Differences in the Ability to Recognise Facial Identity Are Associated with Social Anxiety. [Article]. PLoS ONE, 6(12). doi: e2880010.1371/journal.pone.0028800 Cause Prosopamnesia can be either genetically inherited (developmental) or acquired as a result of incidental brain damage. The exact cause of prosopamnesia is unverified, because there are only two known cases. Each group of doctors that studied the currently diagnosed prosopamnesiacs proposed slightly different explanations for the cause. Dr. Tippett's group described its cause as a \\"disconnection between learning mechanisms and domain-specific representations\\".Tippett, L. J., Miller, L. A., & Farah, M. J. (2000). Prosopamnesia: A selective impairment in face learning. [Article]. Cognitive Neuropsychology, 17(1-3), 241-255. In other words, a general dysfunction in the brain's ability to encode a representation of facial stimuli into memory. Dr. Williams's group hypothesized that prosopamnesia is caused by an inability of the FFA to maintain a stable representation of new faces long enough for them to be encoded into memory. This conclusion is partially based on the patient's differing responses to familiar and unfamiliar faces within the FFA as seen in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses recorded during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tests. Neural processing circuit Fusiform gyrusThe Occipital Face Area is located on the inferior surface of the Occipital LobeSuperior Temporal Sulcus Within the brain, visual stimuli are processed along many different neural circuits. Due to the evolutionary importance of being able to recognize faces and associate information with others based on this recognition, humans have evolved a distinct neural circuit for the processing of facial stimuli.Hole, G. (2010). Face Processing: Psychological, Neuropsychological, and Applied Perspectives. New York: Oxford University Press Inc. Since the discovery of this distinct circuit, the anatomical structures involved have been studied in depth.Atkinson, A. P., & Adolphs, R. (2011). The neuropsychology of face perception: beyond simple dissociations and functional selectivity. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B-Biological Sciences, 366(1571), 1726-1738. doi: 10.1098/rstb.2010.0349 The initial processing of visual stimuli occurs in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), postparietal cortex (PPC), and precuneus. The stimuli are then identified as being facial and more refined processing occurs within the fusiform face area (FFA),Kanwisher, N., McDermott, J., & Chun, M. M. (1997). The fusiform face area: A module in human extrastriate cortex specialized for face perception. [Article]. Journal of Neuroscience, 17(11), 4302-4311. the occipital face area (OFA), and the face-selective region of the superior temporal sulcus (fSTS). The FFA serves low level tasks, such as distinguishing details between similar well-known objects. The OFA and fSTS serve higher level processing tasks, such as connecting a person's identity to their face and processing emotions based on the arrangement of facial features, respectively. Once facial stimuli have been processed, they are then encoded into memory. This involves many brain structures including the medial temporal lobe (MTL), and the hippocampus. Storage and retrieval of these memories involves the same regions of the FFA, PFA, and PPC that performed the initial processing tasks.Miller, B. T., & D'Esposito, M. (2012). Spatial and temporal dynamics of cortical networks engaged in memory encoding and retrieval. [Article]. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 6. doi: 109 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00109 Diagnosis The following criteria are used for diagnosing patients with prosopamnesia: *normal performance on face processing tasks that do not involve memory *poor performance on tasks involving formation of new face memories *normal processing of other types of visual stimuli (e.g. color, objects, etc.) *normal formation of non-face memories (e.g. places, objects, patterns, words, etc.) In the case of acquired prosopamnesia, recognition of faces must correspond to the timing of the injury, i.e. faces learned before the injury are recognized as familiar and faces encountered after the injury are perceived as unfamiliar. Face memory testing Standardizing facial memory and perception testing is key for ensuring accurate diagnosis of prosopagnosia and prosopamnesia. Many face perception and memory tests have been developed and used by researchers in the past including the Warrington Recognition Memory for Faces, Benton Facial Recognition Test and later, The Cambridge Face Perception Test and Cambridge Face Memory Test, which were developed in order to address the shortcomings of the first two tests.Duchaine, B., & Nakayama, K. (2006). The Cambridge Face Memory Test: results for neurologically intact individuals and an investigation of its validity using inverted face stimuli and prosopagnosic participants. Neuropsychologia, 44(4), 576-585. doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.07.001 The Warrington Recognition Memory tests \\"contain abundant non-internal facial feature information\\" and the Benton Facial Recognition Test allows the test subject to \\"rely on feature matching strategies using the hairline and eyebrows rather than recognizing the facial configuration\\".Duchaine, B. C., & Weidenfeld, A. (2003). An evaluation of two commonly used tests of unfamiliar face recognition. Neuropsychologia, 41(6), 713-720. doi: 10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00222-1 The Cambridge Face Perception Test allows participants to look at a target face, while ranking 6 other faces according to their resemblance to the target face.Duchaine, B., Germine, L., & Nakayama, K. (2007). Family resemblance: Ten family members with prosopagnosia and within-class object agnosia. [Article]. Cognitive Neuropsychology, 24(4), 419-430. doi: 10.1080/02643290701380491 Prosopagnosics will fail this test, while prosopamnesiacs will pass it, making it the hallmark for distinguishing between the two disorders. The Cambridge Face Memory Test gives participants 20 seconds to look over a set of target faces. Subjects are then shown test cases, a lineup of three faces, one of which is from the earlier set of target faces. They are given a score based on how many of the target faces they can properly identify from the test cases. The test is repeated using a different set target faces that have different levels of Gaussian noise. A person with normal face processing abilities will score on average around 80% on this test, while someone with impaired face processing or face memory (prosopamnesiacs) will score well below 50%. History Prosopamnesia was first proposed as a distinct neurological disorder in 1996.Tippett, L. J., Miller, L. A., & Farah, M. J. (1996). A case of prosopamnesia: A selective impairment in learning new faces. [Meeting Abstract]. Brain and Cognition, 30(3), 15-15. Doctors observed a patient who appeared to have acquired prosopagnosia after an injury to the temporal lobe. This initial patient was unable to recognize faces of people encountered after the onset of injury, but had no problem in recognizing faces of people known previously. This discrepancy caused the doctors to look at the deficit as one involving the encoding of facial memories and not merely perception. This initial case was one of acquired prosopamnesia. More than a decade later, another group of scientists came across a similar patient. The group initially thought that the patient was prosopagnosic, based on her symptoms. However, upon further investigation, they discovered that the problem was not in the perception of faces, which the patient showed proficiency in based on normal results from the Cambridge Face Perception Test; rather, the patient showed a deficit in remembering facial stimuli, based on poor results from the Cambridge Face Memory Test. Upon this discovery, the doctors found research done in the initial case of prosopamnesia and arrived at the same diagnosis. After this instance, the criteria for diagnosis of prosopamnesia were refined from a list of specific symptoms to a more formal measure which requires a normal score on a facial perception test and a significantly low score on a facial memory test (such as those developed in Cambridge).Williams, M. (2012, October 18). Interview by C Cuda [Personal Interview]. Prosopamnesia. In the second case of prosopamnesia diagnosis, the patient reported a lifetime deficit in the ability to remember faces.Williams, M. A., Berberovic, N., & Mattingley, J. B. (2007). Abnormal fMRI adaptation to unfamiliar faces in a case of developmental prosopamnesia. [Article]. Current Biology, 17(14), 1259-1264. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2007.06.042 This indicated that the damage to the face processing neural circuit causing prosopamnesia can be either genetic (developmental type) or incidental brain damage (acquired type). Implications for neuroscience There are several implications for the neuroscience field that are supported by the discovery of prosopamnesia. Within the neural circuit involved in processing visual stimuli, face processing has its own special circuit. This neural circuit exists at birth, as has been evidenced by newborn babies who show a predisposition to track face-like patterns. Normal babies are also able to recognize familiar faces. This is evidenced by the fact that babies react differently (ex. smile or cry) when approached by people depending on whether or not they are familiar. Based on the theory of evolution, in order for a unique neural circuit to arise and be inherited, it must have provided some distinct survival or fitness advantage. It has been proposed that the ability to recognize faces is important for seeing another person as a friend or an enemy and that over the course of human history, as territorialism made other humans our biggest predators, this ability became crucial for survival. This circuit specializes over time, becoming more adept at distinguishing facial features among familiar people, race-groups, and age-groups. This has led to a phenomenon known as Own Group Bias, in which people are much better at distinguishing among faces of people from their same group. Another implication of prosopamnesia involves division of labor within the brain. Patients with acquired prosopamnesia are able to recognize faces learned before their brain damage occurred. This implicates the division of labor between initial memory encoding and the storage of information, and also suggests that these tasks are performed in different regions within the brain. The distinction between prosopamnesia as a deficit in encoding face memories and prosopagnosia as a deficit in perceiving facial information also implicates division of labor within the face processing neural circuit. The fact that there are many divisions of labor within the face processing neural circuit and other neural circuits in general causes difficulties in distinguishing between similar disorders such as prosopagnosia and prosopamnesia. There are many points along any neural processing circuit, in which deficits could cause similar outcomes. This makes it difficult to diagnose the root neurological cause of physical symptoms, a problem experienced across the field of neuroscience.

Alexandra Narrows, known on some old maps as Mazzaredo Sound, connects Naden Harbour and Virago Sound. An earlier village located at the current village site was named ‚ÄòNightasis‚Äô by the fur trader John Work, and records that in 1840 there were 15 houses with 280 residents.  Clans  The ·∏¥ung village was populated by four main clans: the Staastas Eagles, Those Who Left The West Coast, the Up- inlet Town People and a single Saganusili Raven clan. The east of the village was home to the Up-inlet Town People, who were the original occupants, and Those Who Left The West Coast. The Staastas Eagle clan were the residents of the west side of ·∏¥ung, with the exception of one Rose Spit Raven family known as Saganusili. Guulas was village chief and member of the Up-inlet Town People clan.  Houses from west to east  In 1899, John Swanton interviewed a number of elderly people living in Massett about the village of ·∏¥ung. He recorded information on the last stage of occupation: * House 1: No recorded names. * House 2: Belonged to Chief Qaskiath of the Staatas Eagles; named Hi'ilang Naas (Thunder House). * House 3: Belonged to 7idansuu (Chief Albert Edward Edenshaw) of the Staatas Eagles; named Sk'ulxa Haay'ad (House That Can Hold A Great Crowd of People).

Migration  In 1853 residents from Kiusta village migrated to ·∏¥ung. Chief Albert Edward Edenshaw (7idansuu, One that can hold Crowds) of Kiusta moved his people to ·∏¥ung as part of the larger Haida migrations occurring in the late 1800s, related to massive population decimation resulting from disease. The Haida were hit with a series of smallpox epidemics resulting in population decline from 20,000 prior to 1770 to less than 600 by the late 1800s. The surveyor and geologist, George Mercer Dawson visited the village in 1878 and describes 8 to 10 decaying homes some of which were still inhabited, facing long the bank towards the water. After Dawson‚Äôs visit to the village, residents moved from ·∏¥ung to the larger area of GÃ≤aaw (Old Massett). Provincial government surveyor Newton Chittenden visited ·∏¥ung in 1884 and it had been left as a permanent village, but the site continued to be utilized as a halibut fishing camp with more temporary structures built. Anthropologist George A. Dorsey collected ancestral remains from many Haida grave sites in ·∏¥ung, which were stored at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Dorsey recorded details about the grave sites of former chiefs and spiritual healers (shamans) in his journal, while pillaging the grave sites for human remains. The Haida Repatriation Committee with the Haida Heritage Centre at ·∏¥ay 'Llnagaay have been actively working on repatriating the ancestral remains of over 500 Haidas from provincial, federal and international museums back to Haida Gwaii for traditional burial. There were proposals put forward by the Haida Heritage and Repatriation Society in 2010, to take canoes to the village sites of Yan, ·∏¥ung and Kiusta to hold ceremonies to honour the Haida people that died from smallpox epidemics. Similar ceremonies have been done at sites like Bones Bay, to honour the kuuniisii (ancestors) that died during disease epidemics.

It is one of the architecturally finest mid 19th century factory buildings in the city. Built in 1870 and repeatedly enlarged, most of its sections retain high quality brickwork and mid-19th century Victorian styling. The factory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The complex has been converted into condominium residences known as Kettle Brook Lofts. Description and history The former Ashworth and Jones Factory complex is located in far southwestern Worcester, near the town line with Leicester, on the south side of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 9). The complex consists of a series of buildings that roughly form a U shape. The oldest portion is a three-story brick building, in which windows are set in recessed corbelled wall panels, with pilaster-like piers separating the windows. There is a clock tower on one corner that is topped by a flared mansard roof. The attached additions to the main block are one and two stories in height, and continue the styling and materials used in the original block, despite a forty-year construction range. The factory site used for industrial purposes beginning early in the 19th century, and was purchased by Thomas Ashworth and Edward Jones in 1861, where they manufactured shoddy fabric (using recycled materials). The buildings in which they first operated have not survived. The present building's main block was built in 1870. In the 1880s the business was taken over by E. D. Thayer, who built many of the additions, and manufactured woolens until his death in 1907. George Duffy acquired the facility in 1910, and again enlarged the premises.

Santucho was killed by the Argentine Armed Forces in a shootout in Villa Martelli (Buenos Aires Province) on July 19, 1976.  Background  Santucho developed an early interest in politics. His brother Am√≠lcar belonged to the Communist Party, while elder brother Francisco Ren√©, a writer and scholar of indigenous languages, was kidnapped and disappeared during Isabel Peron's rule in connection with his involvement with the ERP organization. Santucho became involved in politics during his student years at the National University of Tucum√°n. He received a degree in Accounting and served as a delegate in student government. In 1961 he married Ana Mar√≠a Villarreal and together they had three daughters: Ana, Marcela Eva, and Gabriela. During the same period he travelled throughout Latin America with Cuba as his final destination. While in Peru, he became familiar with V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre and drew intellectual inspiration from the founder of the Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (American Popular Revolutionary Alliance, APRA). Later, he would participate in debates and conferences at universities throughout the United States. Santucho was one of the driving forces behind the Junta Coordinadora Revolucionaria (Revolutionary Coordinating Junta), a regional organization composed of Argentina's PRT, Bolivia's √ëancahuaz√∫ Guerrilla organization, Chile's Revolutionary Left Movement, and Uruguay's Tupamaros group. Comrades often referred to Santucho by his nickname \\"Roby,\\" although he was known to use other noms de guerre: Miguel, Comandante Carlos Ram√≠rez, and Enrique Orozco, among others.  Founding of PRT and ERP  Santucho was instrumental in early efforts to unite the Frente Revolucionario Indoamericano (FRIP), of which he was then leader, with the Trotskyite organization Palabra Obrera. The group that emerged from their unification on May 25, 1965, the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist organization known as the Workers‚Äô Revolutionary Party, would combine the indigenous struggles of the former with the class-based politics of the latter to form one of Latin America's most important communist parties. On Santucho‚Äôs initiative, and following shortly after the popular upheaval of 1969 known as \\"the Cordobazo\\", the Fifth Congress of the PRT voted in 1970 in favor of the formation of the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP). Although never officially recognized as the armed wing of the party, ERP contained among its members a large group of PRT militants and, more importantly, a number of armed combatants from diverse political and social backgrounds. Like the PRT, the organization's political platform was essentially anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist, with the socialist program of the PRT front-and-center. At the organizational level, the PRT would function as the political and military command center of the armed faction of ERP, with Santucho acting as secretary general of the former and commanding officer of the latter. ERP would become during the 1970s the largest guerrilla organization in South America, and a prime example in Argentina of the \\"foquismo\\" tactic associated with Che Guevara. Santucho was arrested in August 1971 in the Argentine city of Cordoba and transferred to the Villa Devoto Prison in Buenos Aires. During his time in prison he would enter in contact with members of the Communist Party, the Montoneros, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (FAR) and the Fuerzas Armadas Peronistas. On August 15, 1972, he successfully escaped the Rawson maximum-security detention center and fled to Chile along with several members of FAR and the Montoneros. The escape operation involved, among other dramatic events, the seizure and redirection of a commercial airline flight. Shortly thereafter, the Argentine Armed Forces murdered his wife Ana Mar√≠a Villareal along with 15 other militants in the events later known as the \\"Trelew Massacre\\". In Chile, Santucho and his companions were granted safe passage by then president Salvador Allende to continue onwards to La Habana, Cuba. Santucho returned to Argentina in November 1972 in order to resume his position as leader of PRT- ERP. Santucho would later resist pressures to abandon the armed struggle and enter into dialogue with President H√©ctor J√≥se C√°mpora, the Peronist figurehead for then-exiled Juan Domingo Per√≥n. In a series of public statements he denounced the counterrevolutionary character of the Campora government, as well as Per√≥n's conciliatory attitude towards the Argentine business class.  Death  Mario Roberto Santucho and a significant part of the PRT leadership were killed on July 19, 1976, as part of a covert ambush carried out by a paramilitary task force connected to the Argentine Armed Forces. Captain Juan Carlos Leonetti, who led the covert operation, was also killed in the course of action. A list of names detailing 395 members of the Juventud Guevarista group and Commanding Officers of ERP was discovered in one of Santucho‚Äôs suitcases, along with a set of plans indicating the group's intentions to carry out an attack during the 1978 World Cup (held in Argentina). All 395 members were killed between 1976‚Äì1977. Liliana Delfino, then wife of Santucho, was also captured during the operation and remains among the \\"disappeared\\" victims of the dictatorship whose body was never recovered. According to surviving member and later secretary general of PRT- ERP Arnol Kremer (pseudonym Luis Mattini), the ERP and Montoneros leadership were coordinating efforts to build a unified guerrilla force shortly before Santucho's death. He also stated that the Montoneros were in the advanced planning stages to facilitate Santucho‚Äôs departure for La Habana and that Santucho was, in fact, moments away from leaving when the attack in Villa Martelli occurred. In a 2012 interview with Jorge Rafael Videla, the former military dictator stated that Santucho‚Äôs body disappeared due to the military junta because ‚Äúhis was a figure that created a sense of hope. The appearance of his body would lead to homage and celebration. It was necessary to erase any trace of him.‚Äù  Political theory  Santucho drew from a broad base of political thought. Among the intellectuals that informed his writings and thought were Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky, Milc√≠ades Pe√±a (an Argentine leftist intellectual from the 1960s), Miguel √Ångel Asturias, Rodolfo Kuhn and Hector P. Agosti (an influential communist intellectual, responsible for introducing Gramsci to Argentina) . The Cuban Revolution and Che Guevara also played an important role in his intellectual formation. Santucho was a vocal opponent of popular front politics. He believed that the national bourgeois was incapable of playing a significant role in bringing about political change, and that the contemporary slogan \\"Democracy or Dictatorship\\" common to many liberal sectors belied a common bourgeois interest in maintaining the status quo. Santucho advanced the influential thesis that the Argentine Armed Forces represented a semi-autonomous political class. Regarding Peronism, Santucho considered the phenomenon a prime example of \\"Bonapartism\\", wherein a strongman figure mediates between competing class interests for the purpose of guaranteeing \\"national unity\\". These opinions put him at odds with leftists factions of the Peronist movement, who regarded Per√≥n as an agent of revolutionary change, as well as the Communist Party, which had maintained since Peron's ascent to power in 1945 that Peronism was a local expression of fascism. In that sense, Santucho was equally opposed to a populist movement such as the Montonero's as he was to the gradualist platform of the Communist Party, advocating instead for a socialist revolution as the only viable option for national liberation.

While it starts off as a fishing story, The River Why turns into the story of a young person struggling to come to grips with the modern world. Plot summary A coming-of-age story narrated by Gus Orviston, a high school graduate and the oldest son in a fishing-crazed family. Frustrated with life in Portland, Oregon, and the constant bickering of his bait fishing mother (Ma) and tweed-wearing, fly- fishing father (H2O) over the proper way to fish, Gus moves to a small cabin in the foothills of the Oregon Coast Range. Once there he begins to follow an \\"ideal schedule\\" that has him doing nothing but eating, sleeping, and fishing. In the course of doing nothing but what he loves to do, he begins to notice the scars that humanity has inflicted on the river and forests he loves. Gus also goes through the traumatic event when he is fishing and finds and must transport a dead fisherman to shore, and through this experience he is able to realize how wrong his \\"ideal schedule\\" really is. As he wrestles with what to do, he begins to relate with the people in his neighborhood. He starts to regain his passion for life through his intense passion of the outdoors and fishing, but also through human contact. He also meets his new friend, though while rather eccentric, is also a brilliant thinker, helping Gus see the meaning in his life. Gus continues to grow and mature, mirroring the path to adulthood many experience, until he meets a young fisherwoman, Eddy. Although their relationship is unique, it is also a very true form of love that not only helps Gus to continue to grow into a man, but also teaches him to truly appreciate every aspect of his life. Gus is put to the test when Eddy hooks him a salmon, making him fight it all night up the river. Gus ultimately chooses her and the new life he has started to create for himself by releasing the fish when he finally catches it, mirroring man's quest for success, to only discover that true success is the happiness experienced by the abandonment of preconceived notions of success that are not applicable anymore to a growing life, entering into adulthood. The book ends with Gus completely growing up by confronting his parents with Eddy and forgiving them.

Ives: a reference for pianists and scholars, on which he worked with the late John Kirkpatrick at Yale, and which began his lifelong passion for American classical music. In subsequent years, Struble has written and performed a variety of works, ranging from his Granite State Suite (Op. 26 & 26a), commissioned by the State of New Hampshire for the bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution in 1987 to the somber Archbishop Romero Mass (Op. 18)Composer's Catalog of Compositions (unpublished), provided to the author by the composer October 2008 for mixed chorus, brass choir, timpani and organ, premiered under the composer‚Äôs direction at the cathedral of the San Bernardino/Riverside Roman Catholic Diocese. His compositions range from serious piano sonatas to Broadway-stye-musicals, from to his 2006 Rhapsody for Piano and Jazz Band (Op. 46). He is the author of several articles and reviews which have appeared in 'Musical America', 'Minnesota Composers Forum', American Music Teacher' and other journals, as well as the book The History of American Classical Music, published in 1995 by Facts on File (New York). In addition, his collection of 104 American folk songs, entitled Classic American Folk Music, arranged for piano with historical commentary by the author, was published in two volumes by Belwin Mills in 1996. Struble currently resides in New Hampshire where he continues his work as a musician, author, and educator; working as an English teacher at Kingswood Regional High School in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire.

She is the mother of Ellen and Vance DeGeneres and the first straight spokeswoman for the Human Rights Campaign's National Coming Out Project\\"Yep, I'm an activist: Betty DeGeneres, Ellen's mom, agrees to serve as spokeswoman for HRC's coming-out project\\", The Advocate, October 28, 1997 and an active member of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG). She gained notability following her lesbian daughter Ellen's highly publicized coming out in 1997. Life and career DeGeneres (right) in 1997 The youngest of three daughters, DeGeneres was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1930, during the height of the Great Depression. Her father was German and her mother was Irish. Her sisters (Helen and Audrey) were not involved in day-to-day family life while DeGeneres was in her late teens, but the sisters did become close in adulthood. She attended Louisiana State University (LSU) for two years, studying speech language pathology to become a speech therapist. While in college she performed in a number of plays with Joanne Woodward, who would go on to be an Academy Award- winning actress. She married Elliott DeGeneres in 1952. The couple divorced in 1974. Shortly afterwards, DeGeneres married Roy Gruessendorf, who moved the family to Texas. DeGeneres was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after her second marriage. Their marriage ended in the early 1980s; Gruessendorf died in 1997. In 2005, Ellen spoke publicly for the first time about the molestation she had suffered from her stepfather when she was a teenager. DeGeneres returned to LSU after the age of 50 to complete her master's degree in speech pathology. DeGeneres is the author of two books: Love, Ellen: A Mother Daughter Journey and Just a Mom. In Love, Ellen: A Mother Daughter Journey, Betty describes her reaction to her daughter coming out as a lesbian, and her path from passive acceptance to becoming a passionate advocate for LGBT rights. She also describes the media scrutiny she received after Ellen came out. Her second book, Just a Mom, continues these themes. She also wrote a column for the (now defunct) website PlanetOut called \\"Ask Betty.\\" DeGeneres appeared as an extra in the episode \\"The Puppy Episode\\" of the television sitcom Ellen, in which her daughter Ellen's character comes out. DeGeneres appears in many episodes of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, sitting in the audience. DeGeneres survived breast cancer and discusses this during public appearances.

He was revered as Sant Fateh Singh among his followers.  Early days  Fateh Singh was the son of Channan Singh, a resident of Badiala in Bathinda district of Punjab. Fateh Singh did not have any formal schooling, but he started learning to read and write Punjabi language at the age of 13. He expressed deep interest in the Sikh scriptures, as a result of which his father apprenticed him to a Sikh scholar named Ishar Singh. Later, Fateh Singh migrated to the Ganganagar in the princely state of Bikaner (now in Rajasthan). He toured the nearby villages, preaching the Sikh faith. He also promoted education among the citizens, and established several gurdwaras and schools, besides an orphanage.  Punjabi Suba movement  In the 1950s, Singh entered politics when he started supporting the concept of \\"Punjabi Suba\\", a separate state for the Punjabi speakers in India. By the late 1950s, Fateh Singh had become the senior vice-president of the Shiromani Akali Dal, and had led several marches supporting the Punjabi Suba movement. On 18 December 1960, he started a fast- unto-death in support of his demand. Several prominent Indian leaders tried to convince him to abandon his fast. He ended his fast on 9 January 1961, after the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru issued a statement indicating the support for establishment of a Punjabi Suba. Paul R. Brass, the Professor Emeritus of Political Science and South Asian Studies at the University of Washington, opines that the Sikh leader Fateh Singh tactically stressed the linguistic basis of the demand, while downplaying the religious basis for the demand‚Äîa state where the distinct Sikh identity could be preserved. In July 1962, Fateh Singh broke away from the prominent Sikh leader Master Tara Singh, and formed his own Akali Dal. On 2 October 1962, his party gained control of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee. In the Gurdwara elections on 17 January 1965, Fateh Singh's party annexed 90 of the seats, while Master Tara Singh's party could manage only 45. After a few unsatisfactory meetings with Nehru, on 16 August 1965, Fateh Singh threatened another fast-undo-death and self-immolation, if a Punjabi Suba was not created. However, after the Indo- Pakistani War of 1965 broke out, he decided to postpone his fast, and asked his followers to support the government in this need of hour. After the war ended, the Government of India set up a Cabinet Committee consisting of Indira Gandhi, Mahavir Tyagi and Yashwantrao Chavan to consider the Punjabi Suba proposal. On Fateh Singh's request, a Parliamentary Consultative Committee headed by the Lok Sabha speaker Sardar Hukam Singh was also constituted for the same purpose. The report of the Hukam Singh committee was made public on 18 January 1966, recommending the reorganisation of the Punjab state on linguistic basis. When Indira Gandhi became the Prime Minister after Lal Bahadur Shastri's death, she agreed to the Punjabi Suba proposal. On 3 September 1966, the Punjab Reorganization Bill was introduced in the Lok Sahha and the modern Punjab state came into being on 1 November 1966. However, Fateh Singh was not happy about Chandigarh and some other Punjabi-speaking areas being left out of Punjab. He threatened a fast starting from 17 December 1966 and self-immolation on 27 December 1966, if his demands were not met. Hukam Singh and Giani Gurmukh Singh Musafir (the Chief Minister of the Punjab) persuaded him to end his fast on behalf of Indira Gandhi, and Fateh Singh ended his fast on 27 December 1966. Fateh Singh's influence began to decline in the late 1960s. He started another fast-unto-death on 26 January 1970, demanding the inclusion of Chandigarh into Punjab, but ended it on 30 January. He announced his retirement from politics on 25 March 1972, and died in Amritsar a few months later, on 30 October 1972.

Her mother was Afro-Panamanian and her father was German. She received her BA in photography from San Francisco State University in 2004 and her MFA in photography from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2006. She also participated in Skowhegan School of Painting and Drawing in 2006 Summer Residency Program.Elizabeth Axtman Web site She lives and works in Oakland, California.The Studio Museum in Harlem  Work  Axtman is interested in exploring and molding historical and contemporary representations of American racialization, including the sub-themes of racial passing and the trope of the tragic mulatto. Several of her pieces involve reworking found video and audio, and she often inserts herself‚Äîher voice, her face‚Äîinto her work. In noting that her work draws comedic inspiration from the likes of Richard Pryor and Paul Mooney, she has stated that: \\"Humor has always been a part of what I do. It helps me to talk about things, but it keeps me safe too.\\"Contemporary Confections In her 2005 video American Classics, Axtman stares into the camera at close range and mouths the words to various racially charged film dialogues and monologues, including snippets from the 1934 movie Imitation of Life. Axtman's constant artistic forays into the rhetoric of race suited her work for Black Is, Black Ain't, a group show currently on view at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. Black Is, Black Ain't, which culls its title from Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, and which features Axtman's American Classics, seeks to examine the contemporary moment, where the cultural production of so- called ‚Äúblackness‚Äù is concurrent with efforts to make race socially and politically irrelevant.The Renaissance Society The 2006 video Where‚Äôs The Party At? depicts Axtman, in a white track suit, dancing around a burning cross as the video's eponymous dance track (a song by R&B; group Jagged Edge) plays in its entirety. The video was shot on the grounds of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine, where Axtman was an artist in residence in 2006. In an interview about Where's The Party At?, Axtman admitted: \\"I really got into the historical meaning of burning a cross... When [the Ku Klux Klan] burn it within their little crew of white people in little dresses, there‚Äôs such [a] meaning of spirituality and brotherhood and their white pride. Then they put it in black people‚Äôs yards to [say] 'I hate you nigger, get away.' So it has this really weird double meaning. It was really important for me to feel like I was mocking their sacredness. That was the best part for me...making a joke out of their hatred.\\" Elizabeth Axtman is a recipient of the Skowhegan Endowment for Scholarship Foundation for her 2006 residency there, a Franklin Furnace Fund grant, and was an artist-in-residence with Harvestworks in NYC 2012. Axtman also produces paintings, drawings and mixed media works. She has cited Otabenga Jones, Kehinde Wiley, Guillermo Gomez-Pena, and Adrian Piper as artistic inspirations.  Exhibitions  Video work by Axtman was on view at The Studio Museum in Harlem from February 13 through March 15, 2009. Axtman's work has been exhibited at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland, the Hyde Park Art Center, the Renaissance Society, the Spelman College Museum of Fine Art, and many other museums and galleries.

Whaley Children's Center offers a wide variety of services to meet the basic needs of children and families in need.http://www.mhweb.org/midmichigan/whaley.htm History The Whaley Children's Center was conceived as an idea in the late 1880s by a man named Robert J. Whaley.http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM117H Robert was inspired to open a children's center by the death of his son(Donald M. Whaley) at the age of eleven. His son was saving his earnings to voluntarily give to a children's orphanage in Detroit.http://www.whaleychildren.org/history.php While being inspired by his son's willingness to care for trouble children, Robert began to invest money into his will to build the Donald M. Whaley Home in memory of his son. The Whaley Children's Center was built in 1926, with the leadership of Charles Stewart Mott, who was the first president of the Whaley Foundation. Since the building of the Whaley Children's Center, there has been many additions. In 1955, a recreational building was added, which included; a gym, craft room, and two classrooms. In 1964, the Children's Center went under major renovations for the first time since 1926 to improve the overall appearance. In 1977, Whaley's Children Center was the first agency to provide a foster care treatment program, that would provide children to live with specially trained families. During the same year, an educational center was also added to the recreational center. It included five classrooms, several offices and meeting rooms. In 1982, a special needs adoption program was also a new addition. Treatment Programs Optimist House Established in 1994, the Optimist Househttp://www.whaleychildren.org/o_r.php is a program that focuses on six youth, ranging in ages 6‚Äì17 in a residential environment.

The youth that live in the Optimist House are able to get involved in community activities, and additional educational activities. Rotary House The Rotary House was established in 1985. This group home has a great amount of relation to the Optimist House. Six children have their own individual room in which they have chores and help prepare meals. The children also have the opportunity to be appointed a \\"job\\" for some extra cash. Zonta House The Zonta House was established in 1994. It helps six females ranging from ages 8‚Äì17 in a residential group home environment. With donations given by the community the girls are provided with meals, clothing, shelter and education. The youth that live in the Zonta House are actively involved in community extra-curricular activities.

As late as Jan. 2020, Lewis served as on-air personality and music director for the new Nickelodeon music competition show America's Most Musical Family and worked with the contestants to enhance their weekly performances as they advanced in the competition. Early life Lewis was born on the south side of Chicago, the youngest child of Anna Lewis, a school teacher, and Robert Samuel Lewis (both deceased). Wanting a life better for her son, Anna enforced education early on. Lewis' mother put him in piano lessons at 5 years of age with acclaimed pianist Tom Stevens.http://www.oldtownschool.org/classes/register/FolkDetail.php?folk=41060 Until 9, Lewis began learning the techniques of reading music and of the piano, although he didn't favor classical music. Later in life, Lewis would acknowledge that his objection to classical music at that age was probably because \\"it had rules, with very little freedom to express anything different\\". Upon arriving to Mr. Stevens' home early one week, Lewis heard Mr. Stevens practicing a different style of piano, and when he went upstairs for his lesson, he asked Mr. Stevens to show him what he had been playing. This was Lewis' first discovery of jazz, and where Lewis found a love for the piano. So Lewis' mother extended his lesson time from one half-hour to an hour: a half-hour on classical, and half on jazz. Lewis' mother was heavily involved in church. Lewis, his mother, and his sister, Samantha (deceased), began attending Christ Way Baptist Church under the strict guidance of Rev. Consuella York (who was the first African-American woman to be ordained a Baptist minister in Chicago, and was also the first female chaplain of the Cook County Jail.) Lewis played for all of the services during the week, guided by York's son and Minister of Music, Thomas Alvin Keel, and often played solos. Because Lewis' mother taught school on the north side of the city, she would drop Lewis off at the church early in the morning, and Lewis would stay there until it was time for school, everyday practicing on the church's Steinway and Sons grand piano. At age 10, Lewis then transferred to the Allen Studio Of Music, under the training of Mrs. Lorraine Allen and her son, Ernie Allen, Jr., who was a masterful Hammond organ player. Lewis learned how to play the Hammond organ, although his legs weren't quite long enough to reach the pedals, and by age 12, was teaching at the school. Lewis was looked at as a child prodigy, simply because of how he applied his classical techniques on the Hammond Organ, and because he was teaching choirs at such a young age. For years, a young Lewis made money as a musician, whether playing for various churches, or for weddings and funerals. He attended the De La Salle Institute for high school, and was the first to get a scholarship for music to the school, because he played for all of the liturgical services at the school. Lewis was involved with the school band as a drummer, and won numerous awards for his talents and 1st place in jazz band competitions around the city. It was Lewis' high school band teacher, Larry Pawlowski, that told Lewis that he had the skills to pursue a career in music, and encouraged Lewis to leave Chicago and apply for Berklee College Of Music in Boston, Ma.. Lewis was voted \\"Most likely to become famous\\" by his peers in the Senior yearbook. Musical career Lewis left Chicago in August 1993, and went to be educated at the Berklee College Of Music in Boston, with a dual major in Music Production and Engineering and Music Business. But after 2 years, because of the financial strain, Rob was forced to drop out of school. Lewis got his ‚Äòbig break‚Äô in 1995 when Brian McKnight, whom Lewis met when he was at Berklee, decided to take him on the road for his tour. Lewis' first encounter with McKnight was when his teacher, jazz saxophonist Walter Beasley brought McKnight to Berklee for a clinic in 1993. Almost two years later, after impressing McKnight's musical director, guitarist Jeff Lockhart, a young Lewis was given the opportunity to go on tour with McKnight. Rob worked with McKnight as his keyboardist for years, and also under McKnight in the studio, and later as his musical director. Under McKnight, Lewis learned the art of writing, producing, and arranging. McKnight's influence on Lewis' music is strong, and Lewis acknowledges his time under Brian McKnight as the most influential in his musical journey, because of his admiration of McKnight's writing style, arranging, and vocal production on his own records. Rob Lewis is one of the premier names in the music industry for musical direction. Lewis is sought after for his arranging skill, his attention to detail, and his unique style of interaction with musicians. He remains the musical director for global powerhouse superstar Christina Aguilera (16 yrs), and served as longtime arranger and musical director for New Kids On The Block (10 yrs), Toni Braxton (13 yrs), and has produced the music content and toured with global artists Backstreet Boys, TLC, Boyz II Men, 98 Degrees, has sustained a career as a musical director for more than two decades for pop stars Fifth Harmony, also for The Pussycat Dolls, Leona Lewis, and Jessica Simpson, as well as R&B; stars Brian McKnight, Eric Benet, Deborah Cox, and Fantasia, and iconic legends Patti LaBelle, and Babyface. Lewis recognizes musical director Rickey Minor as a mentor who's referral and direct tutelage provided many opportunities for Lewis to grow as a musical director. Lewis has produced, written songs, and arranged on several #1 albums including Christina Aguilera's Back to Basics, Diddy's Press Play, Fall Out Boy's Infinity on High, Jamie Foxx's Unpredictable, Herbie Hancock's \\"Possibilities\\", Heather Headley's Grammy Award winning \\"Audience of One\\", and Vanessa L. Williams' \\"The Real Thing\\". Lewis' emotional string and horn arranging has gotten him notoriety for his work on Fall Out Boy's single \\"Thnks fr th Mmrs.\\", Christina Aguilera's \\"Oh Mother\\" and \\"Understand\\", Jamie Foxx's \\"Heaven\\",http://www.keysandbeats.com/forum/j/2980-jamie-foxx- unpredictable.html Chrisette Michele's \\"Best of Me\\" and \\"Your Joy\\" (which Lewis also co-wrote with Babyface and Chrisette Michele). Lewis worked with superstar Toni Braxton on several tours, and was responsible for putting the music production together for Toni Braxton's \\"Revealed\\" Flamingo Hotel show in Las Vegas, which ran for two years.http://www.soulofamerica.com/las-vegas- soulful-show-reviews.phtml He is well known in the Gospel genre for his early writing and production with the group Here II Praise, who was signed by gospel legend Daryl Coley and Jenell Alexander Coley through a deal with Verity Records. With their harmonic and artistic capabilities, their album \\"Giving You Nothing But Praise\\" debuted on Billboard's Gospel charts in the Top 20 in Sept. 1998, The choir, led by Lewis, won the \\"Bobby Jones Excellence Award\\" for \\"Best Urban Contemporary Choir of the year\\" at the Gospel Music Workshop of America (GMWA) in 1998, and was nominated for a Stellar Award in 1999. Lewis is a self-taught string arranger, and Grammy Award winning gospel producer Donald Lawrence employed his arranging talents for several projects in the late 1990s including Lawrence's Christmas album \\"Hello Christmas\\", and for Bishop TD Jakes \\"Sacred Love Songs\\", A few years later, Lawrence introduced innovative singer and producer Tonex to Lewis to do arranging for Tonex's O2 album (\\"The Beautiful Place\\" and \\"Even You\\"). Along with arranging, he is also known for his scores and songs with film maker/playwright and NAACP Image Award winner David E. Talbert, who assigned him the moniker \\"Young Q\\", referring to Lewis as a \\"young Quincy Jones\\" (who Lewis always refers to as the \\"greatest musical role model\\" because of Jones' incredible wide range of abilities to arrange, compose, and produce music.) Lewis has written the scores for Talbert's theatrical plays \\"Love Makes Things Happen\\" featuring the music of Babyface, \\"The Fabric Of A Man\\", \\"He Say She Say, But What Does God Say\\", and Lewis wrote the original songs and score for \\"Love On Layaway\\" starring Deborah Cox and Cassie Davis. For Talbert's feature film \\"First Sunday\\", starring Ice Cube and Tracy Morgan, Lewis wrote and produced the song \\"Live Again\\" which played during the end credits. Rob Lewis Co-hosting the American Music Awards Red Carpet Pre-Show Rob Lewis served as a LA Chapter Governor for The Recording Academy, where he worked hard with the Academy to create opportunities to educate up and coming music professionals, and to make a difference in the ailing music industry. As a part of The Recording Academy, Rob Lewis was a part of special events and panels and conducted workshops for Grammy Career Day,http://www2.grammy.com/Recording_Academy/Chapters/Los_Angeles/News/Default.aspx?newsID=2837 Grammy Soundchecks,http://www2.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/News/Default.aspx?newsID=2905&newsCategoryID;=11 and Grammy U.

Recently, Lewis' work was a major part of the success of the 45-city arena tour Total Package Tour with New Kids On The Block, Paula Abdul, and Boyz II Men. Lewis also puts focus towards the management of touring musicians and artists. Lewis started his philanthropic venture \\"The Dreamers Movement\\" six years ago and annually runs a coat drive in New York City providing coats for boys and girls shelters with the help of his supporters and friends. In 2012, Rob Lewis released his debut album \\"The Masterpiece\\", which features Lewis as an arranger, songwriter, singer, and musician. The album, solely produced by Lewis, took five years to finish, but has extensive arranging of string orchestras, horns, and live instruments. Lewis considers the album to be \\"his greatest work\\" because of the time spent on finishing it, but also because it is described as a \\"collage of influences and the result of his time with all of the celebrated musicians and artists that he has worked with\\". The album has 11 songs, and ranges from soul music, urban contemporary R&B;, to jazz and inspirational. His work with Christina Aguilera Lewis began touring with Christina Aguilera in 2002, following the release of her second album \\"Stripped\\". Lewis was Aguilera's co-musical director, under Rickey Minor, and traveled as her musical director during the co-headlining \\"Justified/Stripped Tour\\" with Justin Timberlake in 2003. In 2004, Lewis was contracted by Aguilera to arrange her Grammy performance of \\"Beautiful\\", which featured a 21-piece string orchestra, the Roger Wagner Chorale, and her band. That night, \\"Beautiful\\" earned Aguilera the Grammy for \\"Best Female Pop Vocal Performance\\". In addition, Lewis was very involved in Aguilera's 2006 Back to Basics album as a vocal arranger and producer, string arranger, horn arranger, and was a co-writer on \\"Without You\\" (co-written by Christina Aguilera, Kara DioGuardi, and Mark Ronson), Lewis also traveled and collaborated with Aguilera as her musical director and arranger on her 2006-07 Back to Basics Tour and the tour DVD, \\"Back to Basics: Live and Down Under\\", and has also served as her vocal producer on numerous occasions and on records including \\"Tell Me\\", the lead single from Diddy's 2006 \\"Press Play\\" album. Lewis' vocal production work with Aguilera helped to earn a Grammy nomination in 2006 for Herbie Hancock's album Possibilities (Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals, for \\"A Song for You\\") and Lewis was a vocal producer for Aguilera's hit \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", which won a 2007 Grammy Award for \\"Best Pop Performance\\". In 2012, Lewis received vocal production and co-writing credits on her album \\"Lotus\\" (Sing For Me), and he remains her pianist, arranger, and musical director for all of her live performances today. Additionally, he arranged Aguilera‚Äôs 2015 NBA All-Star game New York-inspired opening performance. Lewis also served as the musical director for Aguilera‚Äôs critically acclaimed first tour in a decade in 2018, Liberation Tour in support of her sixth album, Liberation, and for her Vegas residency The Xperience. His work with Babyface Lewis worked closely with Kenny \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds, as a writer, string arranger, producer, and musical director, and started touring with Edmonds in 2005. Edmonds used Lewis' skills as an arranger on albums with Jamie Foxx (\\"Heaven\\"), Fall Out Boy (\\"Thnks Fr Th Mrms\\"), and made him an integral part of his covers album Playlist, and is featured on Edmonds' \\"Grown and Sexy\\" DVD. While in Boston for a performance with Edmonds, Lewis took Edmonds to Berklee College of Music to talk with some students, and while there, surprised Edmonds with the creation of a new master songwriting class at Berklee College of Music titled \\"The Music of Kenny \\"Babyface\\" Edmonds\\", in homage to Babyface‚Äôs work in the music industry.http://www.berklee.edu/community/pulse/griot_v1_2008.pdf Together Lewis and Babyface have written and arranged songs including \\"Your Joy\\" with Chrisette Michele for her debut album \\"I Am\\", and \\"Loving You\\" for Vanessa L. Williams' 2009 album \\"The Real Thing\\". Lewis considers Babyface to be one of the greatest influences in his career as a writer and producer, and considers his time under Edmonds as \\"the greatest school ever\\". His work with Diddy In 2006, Christina Aguilera brought Lewis into the studio to work with her to arrange and produce the vocals for music mogul Diddy's lead single \\"Tell Me\\". While working on the song, Diddy noticed Lewis' work ethic and style when producing vocals and had such a regard for Lewis' skills as a vocal producer and arranger, he told Lewis that he was going to put him \\"on TV\\". Shrugging the notion off Lewis didn't give it much thought, until he received a call from MTV stating that Diddy wanted him to be a part of the series \\"Making The Band\\". As a vocal coach and producer, Lewis was featured on MTV's \\"Making the Band\\", Season 3 with Diddy and pop girl group Danity Kane. Diddy also enlisted Lewis to work on most of his album, where Lewis did vocal production for \\"Come to Me\\" working with Nicole Scherzinger, \\"Tell Me\\", working with Christina Aguilera, \\"Making It Hard\\" working with Mary J. Blige, string arranging for \\"Thought You Said\\" featuring Brandy, and co-wrote two songs with Diddy, \\"Crazy Thang\\" and \\"Claim My Place\\". In 2009, Rob Lewis was commissioned by Diddy once again to be on MTV's television series \\"Making His Band\\" where Lewis used his musical directing skills to assist Diddy in finding young, up and coming artists to create Diddy's new band for his forthcoming tour.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFBdhfST2g His work with New Kids On The Block/Backstreet Boys/Boyz II Men/98 Degrees/TLC In 2008, Lewis was enlisted as musical director for New Kids On The Block's highly anticipated reunion tour. Working closely with Donnie Wahlberg, Lewis has been musical director and arranged the music for the last five tours, and they continue to work together on tours and television projects. Wahlberg has featured Lewis on his reality shows Wahlburgers and Donnie Loves Jenny. Lewis was the musical director/arranger for the highly successful mashup 2011-2012 World Tour for New Kids On The Block and the Backstreet Boys (NKOTBSB), and also for the NKOTB's 2013 sold out arena tour \\"The Package\\" with Boyz II Men and 98 Degrees, where Lewis served as musical director and arranger for all three acts. In 2015, Lewis served as musical director for \\"The Main Event\\" tour with New Kids On The Block featuring TLC and Nelly. In 2017, Lewis was commissioned to create the musical arrangements for the Total Package Tour, with New Kids On The Block, Paula Abdul, and Boyz II Men. His work on VH1's Big Morning Buzz Live with host Nick Lachey Lewis was an on-air personality, dubbed the \\"One Man House Band\\", for the last three seasons of the VH1 television show Big Morning Buzz Live, when 98 Degrees frontman Nick Lachey became the host. The morning show aired on VH1 five days a week and featured celebrity guest interviews, live music performances, and musical skits. Brought in by longtime friend and television director Rik Reinholtsen, Lewis was introduced to the show's executive producer- four-time Emmy-award winning television producer Shane Farley (Rachael Ray, FABLife, The Gossip Table). Lewis' original role on the show was to appear once a week in a segment called the \\"Remix Rewind\\"- a segment where Lachey and Lewis would perform a song that would chronicle the highlights of the week, always co-written with producer Devin Delliquanti (The Daily Show). Farley expanded Lewis' role on the show as the seasons continued, making Lewis an everyday on-camera personality, utilizing his arranging and musicianship for the musical skits and bumpers, conducting interviews, and even gave Lewis a reoccurring segment called \\"Rob Lewis Presents\\", where Lewis was able to highlight his own alliance of singers and performers. The show was cancelled in 2015. Philanthropy In 2009, through an entity created by Rob Lewis- \\"The Dreamers Movement\\", fans were instrumental in helping to provide new pots and pans, clothing, and financial contributions to the Create Young Adult Boys Shelter in New York, and for Christmas, Lewis orchestrated a coat drive for the Turning Point Young Women Shelter in Brooklyn, NY. All residents at the shelter received brand new coats and accessories for Christmas from all over the world, through generous donations and support from NKOTB fans, affectionately known as \\"Blockheads\\". 2014 marked the sixth consecutive year for The Dreamer's Movement's coat drive. Lewis' current dream effort is working to build his own music education facility in New York, \\"MISOMA\\" (The Movement Institute, School of Musical Advancement), a facility where music education and the arts are brought to the inner city, and where young kids and young adults can learn and experience the arts without cost. \\"The Dreamers Movement\\", is dedicated to providing awareness, care, and help to the less fortunate, using music and the patronage of his supporters to give hope and inspire the lives of homeless young adults. While on the road with various artists, Rob Lewis creates live jam sessions, in which he raises money and sponsors shelters and food banks in selected cities. Awards In September 2007, Lewis was awarded the \\"Distinguished Alumni Award\\" from Berklee College Of Music in recognition of his career accomplishments.

An urban forest, it is encroached by the metropolitan area's constant growth. It is mostly composed of oak, holm oak and pine. It is a remnant of a larger, now vanished, forest of more than 27,000 hectares. Its name comes from a local natural promontory called El Nixticuil.Exhorta al Ejecutivo Federal a Declarar como √Årea de Protecci√≥n de Recursos Naturales al Bosque de El Nixticuil - Sitio Oficial Diputados Federales PAN  Features   Extent  The forest stretches over 1,860 hectares, of which 1,591 have been established as a protected areaEl bosque El Nixticuil, a un paso de ser declarado √°rea natural protegida - La Jornada JaliscoEn defensa del bosque El Nixticuil - La Jornada Jalisco (NPA) under the category of municipal watershed protection area (Area Municipal de Protecci√≥n Hidrol√≥gica). The areas covered by the forest protection decree cover Nixticuil, the Cerro del Diente and the community of San Esteban, which form part of the R√≠o Blanco watershed.  Fauna and flora  The forest's wildlife include coyote, fox, skunk, rabbit, opossum, various species of rodents and birds, reptiles, amphibians and insects. Various bird counts have been conducted in the forest, with one study by the University of Guadalajara reporting 107 distinct avian species (two rare, seven threatened and a one under special protection). In addition to oaks, pines and holm oaks, there is also a great biodiversity of herbs and shrubs such as kidneywood, copal, mallow, mugwort, foxtail, and other trees such as willow, the amate fig, and the cat's claw (tepame) and needle bush (huisache) acacias. It is one of three known habitats of the Styrax jaliscana, a white-flowering shrub in the Styrax family.  Threats  Water district agency's machinery at one entrance to Nixticuil Forest This forest is currently threatened for several reasons. Environmental organizations such as the Comit√© Salvabosque de El NixticuilIntereses inmobiliarios ‚Äúimpiden la protecci√≥n‚Äù - Ediciones Impresas Milenio and the Comit√© Salvabosque Tigre II have decided to undertake actions to protect it.Detienen construcci√≥n del SIAPA en El Nixticuil - El Informador  Protected status  In 2005, neighbors and activists petitioned the city of Zapopan to grant the official status of \\"Protected Area\\" to 30 hectares of forest. This came after 2004's rainy season, when the ground gave way in the Nextipac community, affecting its inhabitants. At that point, the Zapopan city government intended to relocate those residents to a forested area adjacent to Tigre II, with construction scheduled for 2005. Those already living in Tigre II who wanted to avoid the destruction of the forest, and a significant number of Nextipac residents who refused their forced removal,Los vecinos de las Grietas de Nextipac-Santa Lucia: Cambios en las condiciones de vida, percepciones ante el riesgo y posiciones sobre la reubicaci√≥n al Predio del Bosque El Tigre II y la intervenci√≥n de la autoridad municipal. - Dra. Ofelia P√©rez Pe√±a, Profesor investigador del CUCBA y Dr. Gabriel Torres, Profesor del CIESAS united to oppose this project. Following this, the work was suspended and negotiations began. These negotiations continued until the city government decided without warning to retake and expand the territory designated for construction. Thereafter, protests renewed, and on May 18, 2005, the protesters managed to stop the work again, by which time more than 300 oak trees had been cut down. Together with the Zapopan municipal government's plan to construct public housing on 5 hectares of forest, various other public and private developments have been proposed within Nixticuil Forest. The development sponsored by the Villa de los Ni√±os Association consists of the construction of a building complex, while the Autonomous University of Guadalajara (UAG) presented a project to construct a \\"University Science and Technology Research Park\\".Se Asocia la UAG con el Instituto de Virolog√≠a de Maryland Nexo en L√≠nea - Universidad Aut√≥noma de Guadalajara By the end of 2006 the Zapopan government proposed the designation of Nixticuil Forest as a natural protected area.

Isabel that caters a five-year Secondary Level Education (or High School) to specifically less-privileged girls or women who works during the day, so that they could study or finish High School after working hours.A large percentage of the Night High School students are domestic helpers, who are usually stay-in, and handles most of the household chores of their employers. It is reported that there are students who finishes the chores as late as 11:00pm to 12:00am, and that's the only time they could start working on their school homeworks. There had been incidents of students collapsing inside the classrooms. There were also cases of students who suffers maltreatment to violence from their employers. The USI-NHS Secondary Education Curriculum has been reengineered to give more emphasis to Technology and Livelihood Education, in anticipation of the great percentage of its graduates who can't afford College Education as they are less-privileged or belonging to less-privileged families. In spite of the students' being less-privileged, they are encouraged to live up to the Vincentian doctrines inculcated by the university, where \\"service to the poor, is service to God\\". For being educated in, or a graduate of the Universidad de Sta. Isabel is already a privilege (grace) given by God, therefore they too should extend God's grace to others who are also less-privileged, and the poorest of the poor. History of USI-NHS Inspired by the charisma of St. Vincent de Paul, the administration of the, then Colegio de Sta. Isabel, headed by its President, Sister Justine I. Rosales, D.C. thought of opening a night secondary classes for working girls / women. A survey was made by Dr. Milagros Reyes, head of the Research and Development Office, to the nearby Barangays of Naga City to find out the feasibility of opening a high school night classes in CSI. In the school year 1998-1999, Sister Justine I. Rosales, D.C., the school president opened the Night High School with Mrs. Josephine T. Ensano appointed as the principal. It started with twelve (12) students only in the first year, after campaigning from the different offices in the city where there are employers with household helps. The following year SY 1999-2000, the two year levels had fifty (50) students. In SY 2000-2001, the three year levels had eighty-five (85) students and it consistently increased to four-hundred forty-seven (447) last school year for the five year levels, in its tenth year. Government recognition was granted last August 2, 2002. The Night High School had its six batches of graduates from 2003 with the first batch of eighteen (18) students. In 2004, another eighteen (18) students, in 2005, sixteen (16) students, in 2006, there were 28 graduates, in 2007, 35 graduates and in 2008, 39 graduates. Hopefully the NHS graduates will keep increasing through the years. Every year, the department is also improving in many ways. There are very good committed veteran teachers who volunteered to teach. These teachers are also teaching in the Basic Education Day Dept., some are from the Higher Education Dept., and others are co-academic personnel who are teachers themselves and some from other schools teaching during the day. In 2004, some qualified 50 students in the first year until their fourth year were granted by FAPE with the ESC program of the government financial assistance to private school students. Now, in its 5th year of the program, there is a total of 283 ESC and EVS grantees enjoying the four years assistance of P 5,000.00 each every year. 5th year Students who were not able to pay their tuition fees were helped by the H.S. Batch ‚Äô69, their yearly scholarship program. The department has acquired instructional materials such as computers, TV set with DVD, radios and karaoke, Science apparatuses, overhead projector and books through the donations from the USI alumni abroad, the Lilia Tan Foundation and the ESC and EVS grantees. The students have sets of textbooks for rent, which are increasing in number every year. It is hoped that more donations and financial support be received in the years to come. The USI-NHS Seal Night High School Seal The Night High School Logo is emblazoned in the department's motiff, which is the Sky Blue color. A Moon, along with the five stars around it symbolizes \\"Night\\", implying the department's late class schedules. The moon is in its crescent form in the very first quarter of the month, or the start of the lunar month or the New Moon. As the New Moon it symbolizes the bright new beginning of a less- privileged individual to elevate her (perhaps also her family's) status. As crescent, the moon specifically means \\"waxing\\", \\"increasing\\", and \\"to grow\\", as students of the Night High School are urged to grow mentally, physically, and mostly, spiritually. The moon also appears to be embracing the University Seal of Universidad de Sta Isabel, meaning the Night High Student must embrace the Vincentian ideals of the University, for such growths to materialize. The moon and the University seal is surrounded by five stars. Each star is the five-pointed pentacle, that in Christian symbolism means the five wounds of Christ when He died on the cross. As they are Christ's pain sacrifices, the pentacle also symbolizes the pains and sacrifices of a Night High Student who works during the day, and attends classes at night while everybody's at rest as shown by the sleeping expression of the Crescent Moon. The five stars symbolizes the five year levels as the Night High School has a five-year Secondary Education Curricula. Each star is placed in precisely equal distances around the moon, forming the five sturdy spokes of a wheel, meaning support. Like a wheel the Night High School shall roll continuously as long as there are less-privileged women with a dream. General information The Night High School Program The Night High School Program is a formation program catered to the less-privileged girls / women to become better persons as they move from the first year to the fifth year, be better equipped with the set of knowledge, attitudes, values and skills towards becoming a fully mature Christian and Vincentian Filipino.

It has operations in both the United States and Canada, and has headquarters in The Woodlands, Texas and Vaughan, Ontario. It is the third largest waste management company in North America. Near the end of 2018, the company removed \\"Inc.\\" from its corporate name. The company is now known simply as \\"Waste Connections\\".  History  The company was founded in 1997, by a group of professionals in Washington and Idaho with industry related experience. Waste Connections, Inc. expanded very quickly. Within about a year of its founding the company decided to go public, launching its IPO in May 1998. The company then slowly expanded into California and the western United States. As of 2011, It had operations in 32 of the 50 U.S states. In December 2011, the company announced that it was moving its headquarters from Folsom, CA to The Woodlands, Texas, a suburb of Houston. Chief Executive Officer, Ron Mittelstaedt, cited California's high taxes and dysfunctional legislature as key reasons for the move. In September 2012, it acquired R360 Environmental Solutions, a Texas waste company specializing in the oil industry. In January 2016, Waste Connections bought Progressive Waste Services of Canada for $2.67 billion. Under the deal, Waste Connections shareholders received 70% of the new company, which moved its tax headquarters to Canada. It later re-branded its Canadian division Waste Connections of Canada. In January 2017, it acquired privately held Illinois waste firm Groot Industries for approximately $400 million. Operations Waste Connections's primary business is to provide solid waste collection and disposal services. It most often does this through contracts with municipalities to collect the waste in that municipality, for an agreed-upon rate. It also provides services directly to residential, commercial, or industrial customers. In addition, Waste Connections runs landfills for waste disposal (82 solid waste landfills as of September 2019). In Q3 2017, 67% of revenue was from solid waste collection, 21% from solid waste disposal and transfer, 4% from recycling, 5% from its oil industry waste operations, and 3% from other sources. 16% of revenue was from Canada, with the rest from the United States. Controversy In September 2019, the investigative journalism program CBC Marketplace installed trackers into bales of plastic and commissioned three plastics recycling companies to process them: GFL Environmental, Merlin Plastics and Waste Connections Canada. Merlin Plastics shredded and recycled the bales and GFL Environmental incinerated the bales in a waste-to-energy facility. However, the trackers indicated that Waste Connections dumped the plastic bales into a landfill in Richmond and a junkyard in Surrey, British Columbia instead of recycling them. The company responded \\"There was some miscommunication and the driver took this load to a waste facility.\\" CBC \\"We asked 3 companies to recycle Canadian plastic and secretly tracked it. Only 1 company recycled the material\\", September 28, 2019 Corporate structure and leadership Waste Connections' senior leadership is structured as follows: * Ronald J.

Founded in 2007 by Tyler Duncan as My Dear Disco, the name change came in March 2011. The band first released the eponymous EP My Dear Disco in 2007, releasing its first album Dancethink LP in January 2009. The album fused electro-pop, funk, rock, and techno into a distinctive sound the band members have dubbed \\"DanceThink\\". The band released two more EPs in 2010 and their last EP Love Child in March 2011, before going into an \\"indefinite hiatus\\" in October 2011. In 2013, band vocalist Michelle Chamuel took part in the fourth season of The Voice and finished in second place. Career Ella Riot, originally called My Dear Disco, evolved from founding member Duncan's 2005 instrumental endeavor, Toolbox. Duncan who played bagpipe, with percussionist Aaron Gold, guitarist Theo Katzman, and bassist Christian Carpenter, all undergraduate students at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, developed experimental tracks using Irish bagpipe as the lead instrument and a laptop to mix bass music and techno drum beats. Later guitarist Robert Lester and keyboardist Joey Dosik joined the group. Michelle Chamuel, a classmate of Duncan, recorded a track named \\"My Dear Disco\\" with Lester independent of the Toolbox project. Later she worked with the band on a track named \\"White Lies\\". The band was impressed with her vocals and asked her to join. My Dear Disco, named after musician Matthew Dear, was officially founded with her inclusion in 2007. Duncan switched from bagpipe to synthesizer, but occasionally played bagpipe during live performances. The band members area of study at the University of Michigan ranged from classical drum to jazz to performance and technology. They graduated in 2008. The lineup changed with Mike Shea replacing Gold on drums. Named one of the most promising college bands in the nation by the New American Music Union, the band was invited to perform at the 2008 A.E. Music Festival hosted by Anthony Kiedis. In the summer of 2008, the band performed at BlissFest, Hoxeyville, Dunegrass, Feel Good Festival, and Jazz Aspen Snowmass. The band's debut album, Dancethink LP, was co-produced by Mark Saunders. It was released in January 2009. An album review characterized the music as having diverse influences and called it \\"a trance album with a rock and roll spine\\". The newly released techno-pop tracks earned the band a spot on the rosters of 2009 Wakarusa Festival, 10,000 Lakes Festival and South by Southwest, where they performed alongside Dave Matthews, Wilco, Widespread Panic and others. In October 2009 the band appeared on Fox 5 television show Fearless Music. The band was named BMI's Pick of the Month artist in November 2009. In 2009 the band performed over 150 shows. In September 2009 Dosik left the group and relocated to California. Soon after guitarist Katzman and then in September 2010 bassist Carpenter left to pursue solo careers. Joe Dart filled in for Carpenter. Dart played bass on the 2011 Love Child EP. After Dart's departure from the group, in 2011 Matt Henninger became the next bass player. Katzman's departure in early 2010 marked the group's change from a seven piece to a five piece band. The band's remix of Kanye West's \\"Love Lockdown\\" earned high praise from Arjanwrites music blog, citing the use of live instruments as a reason. The band's remix of Todd Edwards' \\"I Might Be\\" was made for and released on a Scion A/V remix collection. The two tracks were later released on the 2010 The Remixes EP. As of July 2010 the band had performed over 250 shows in a two-year period. In August 2010 the band performed at Lollapalooza music festival. In December 2010, the band completed work on their second studio release Love Child EP. It was engineered by Oliver Strauss and recorded at Mission Sound studio in New York. In March 2011, My Dear Disco changed its name to Ella Riot, citing legal concerns and the old name's implied genre. The new name was in part a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald. In Greek, \\"Ella\\" means bright light or torch, and \\"Ella Riot\\" was a tribute to the goals and image of the band. Shortly after the name change, Love Child EP was released in March 2011. Being a studio recording and final release, it was the band's second definitive work. An album review characterized the music as pop influenced by funk, techno and house, and called the approach \\"hardly doctrinaire\\". The band released a music video of the EP's fourth track \\"It Could Be\\". In September 2011, the band announced the decision to put Ella Riot on an indefinite hiatus, citing the need to develop other aspects of their lives. Soon after, Duncan and Chamuel as a duo released an album titled s/he. The album credits contributions by all then current band members. As of July 2013, eight band members had continued to make music as independent artists ‚Äì Duncan, Lester, Chamuel, Katzman, Dosik, Dart, Carpenter and Gold.Band members, independent works:  * Style The band was influenced by Daft Punk, Justice, Brazilian Girls, and early Michael Jackson. Their music \\"combines elements from rock, dance, electronic, soul, punk, pop, and jazz music to engage the body and the mind\\". Although made for dance and live performance, the band's objective was to make music that could stand and be enjoyed on its own merit. According to an AllMusic album review, \\"This is fine, well-crafted music from a group with a mind of its own\\". According to band guitarist Lester, \\"It's about writing music that's as satisfying for your body as it is for your mind\\". The band referred to its musical style as \\"DanceThink Music\\". In 2008 engineer Mark Saunders, who had developed Grammy- nominated albums with Shiny Toy Guns and The Cure, co-produced the band's debut album named Dancethink in the Beat360 Studios in New York City. In visual media In November 2009, the song \\"My Dear Disco\\" was used in a promotional commercial for Season 1 Episode 9 of Melrose Place. In 2009 the song \\"White Lies\\" was used in Season 1 Episode 11 of the online television series Little White Lie. Chamuel performed the vocals on the series' theme song \\"Caught In the Lie\\".

The Huron-Manistee National Forest, in the northern part of Michigan's Lower Peninsula, provides ORV enthusiasts an opportunity to ride off-road vehicles on superb forest trails. Following the legal guidelines will ensure the ride is safe and enjoyable. For questions relating to state laws and regulations please visit the Michigan Department of Natural Resources website , there you will also be able to obtain an ORV sticker (Trail Permit) and maps of this and other state trail systems. Rules and regulations According to the Michigan Hand Book of Off- Road Vehicle Laws \\"Michigan law defines an ORV as any motor vehicle that can be operated cross-country (without benefit of a road or trail) over land, snow, and other natural terrain. This includes: multi-track or multi-wheeled vehicles; all-terrain vehicles (ATVs); motorcycles or related multi-wheeled vehicles; amphibious machines (water-to-land and back); hovercraft; and other vehicles that use mechanical power including 2- or 4-wheel-drive vehicles that are highway registered but operated off highways or off roads.\\" This trail system is also patrolled to ensure that all ORV operators and all passengers wear a U.S. Department of Transportation‚Äì approved crash helmet and protective eyewear or goggles except when the ORV is equipped with an approved roof and the operator and passengers are wearing properly adjusted and fastened safety belts. Also, each rider must utilize a U.S. Forest Service‚Äìapproved spark arrestor and muffler in good working condition, in constant operation, and meeting applicable sound-level standards. Finally, a State of Michigan ORV sticker must be purchased on a yearly basis and clearly displayed on each vehicle. User reviews In an interview conducted on Monday February 16, 2009, Mr. Jonathan S. Byrd said, \\"Bull Gap's trail systems are some of the best trails in the great lakes area. The diversity of the scenery and wildlife make every trip an adventure. Having traveled to other states and explored various trail systems the Bull Gap trail systems are by far some of the most enjoyable to experience.\\" In an interview conducted on Wednesday February 18, 2009, Mrs. Christine L. Baker said, \\"Out of all the trails I have ever ridden Bull Gap is by far my favorite. The Sandy Soil is very forgiving and there are lots of nice changes in elevation.\\" And finally, on February 18, 2009, Mr. Randall M Baker said, \\"Bull Gap is one of the best places to off-road in the state. It has a wide variety of trail types ranging from open fast and straight to tight, twisty, slow and dangerous. The DNR grades it about once a month but that does not stop some areas from getting extremely bumpy and dipped-out. The only other major downfall of the trail system is the dust. During the hot dry summer months the entire area can get extremely dusty making it sometimes difficult to see five feet ahead of you. As long as you are well prepared this system can provide days of enjoyment for everyone from the beginner dirt bike rider to those with advanced bike or Atv riding skills.\\" Other local recreation options The Huron-Manistee National Forests comprise almost of public lands extending across the northern lower peninsula of Michigan. The Huron-Manistee National Forests provide recreation opportunities for visitors, habitat for fish and wildlife, and resources for local industry. In 1909, the Huron National Forest was established and the Manistee National Forest was formed in 1938. In 1945, these two National Forests were administratively combined. Working hand in hand with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and other partners, the Forest Service has changed the \\"lands that nobody wanted\\" to healthy forests again.http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/hmnf/index.shtml This forest offers the general public the opportunity to camp, hike, snowmobile, boat/canoe, sightsee, fish, hunt, cross-country ski, bike or hike.

Many critics have also called her a feminist writer. Biography Born in Nagasaki to young, unmarried parents (her father was 18, her mother 15), Sata moved to Tokyo while still a child. Her first job was in a caramel factory, but she later went on to work in restaurants where she befriended several writers, including Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa. In 1922 her poems were published for the first time in Shi to jinsei (\\"Poetry and life\\"). Working at the Koroku caf√©-bar in Hongo, near Tokyo University, she met Nakano Shigeharu who would remain a lifelong friend. Along with Nakano, left-wing writers Hori Tatsuo and Tsurujir≈ç Kubokawa ran the progressive literary magazine Roba (Donkey). Nakano inspired Sata to write her first short story, Kyarameru koba kara (From the Caramel Factory) in 1928. Having already divorced her first husband, she then married Kubokawa. While praised by such luminaries at Kawabata Yasunari for drawing on modernist literary techniques, Sata became increasing involved in issues related to workers and the labor movement. In 1929, she spoke out against the treatment of women workers in cigarette factories. In 1931, she defended the striking workers of the Tokyo Muslin Factory. As a member of the Proletarian Literature Movement, she wrote a series of short stories about the lives of ordinary working men and women. These included Kyoseikikoku (Compulsory Extradition), about the rights of migrant Korean workers and Kambu joko no namida (Tears of a Forewoman). In 1932 she joined the outlawed Japan Communist Party (JCP). She became close to JCP leaders Kenji Miyamoto and Takiji Kobayashi, the former imprisoned until 1945 and the latter tortured to death by police in 1933. In 1935 she was arrested for anti-war activism and spent two months in jail. This experience is described in part in her semi-autobiographical novel, Kurenai (Crimson), which was serialized from 1936‚Äì38 and focuses on the troubled married life of a woman writer much like Sata. Sata's strong opinions were often at odds with the official Communist Party platform; juggling the many demands she faced as a writer, activist, mother and wife, she eventually became estranged from her husband, whom she finally divorced in 1945. Having been forced by the authorities to sever her connection with the Communist Party in the mid-1930s, she eventually collaborated with the authorities by writing literature in support of the Japanese war effort during WWII. With the end of the war in 1945 Sata's writing re-emerged as part of the new democratic movement. In 1946 she rejoined the JCP (Japanese Communist Party), although, as before, she often voiced vehement criticism of the party. Her wartime experiences were the subject of Watashi no T≈çky≈ç Chizu (My Tokyo Map), which was written between 1946 and 1948. In 1954 she wrote Kikai no naka no seishun (Youth among the Machines). Her collected works were issued in 15 volumes in 1958‚Äì59. She would write Onna no yado (\\"Women's Lodgings\\") in 1963 and Omoki nagarani (On a Heavy Tide) in 1968‚Äì69. By 1964 Sata had rejoined the JCP after yet another expulsion. She was one of the founders of the new Women's Democratic Clubher activities in the organization, judged divisive from the perspective of the party mainstream,Keene, Donald. Dawn to the West: Japanese Literature in the Modern Era. 2nd Ed. New York: Columbia University Press, 1998. led to another expulsion from the JCP. Sata was awarded the Noma Prize in 1972 for her book Juei (The Shade of Trees), which deals with the relationships between Chinese and Japanese people in Nagasaki after the dropping of the atomic bomb. In 1973, she was offered the Geijutuin Onshisho (Imperial Art Academy Prize) for her life's work, but she refused the award as she regarded it as a nationalist congratulation prize. She accepted the Kawabata Prize for short stories in 1977. In 1983, Sata received the Asahi Prize for the entire body of her work. She gave an acceptance speech which expressed regret for her contributions to the war effort. Her long-time colleague Nakano Shigeharu died in 1979. Her book about him, Natsu no Shiori ‚Äì Nakano Shigeharu o okuru (Memories of Summer ‚Äì a Farewell to Shigeharu Nakano) was awarded the Mainichi Art Award in 1983. Most of Sata's work was translated into Russian in the Sixties and Seventies. Two short stories from the prize-winning collection Toki ni tatsu (Standing Still in Time) have been translated into English. The 1986 story Chisai yama to tsubaki no ki (Camellia Blossoms on the Little Mountain) appeared in Japanese Literature Today, the English magazine issued by the Japan PEN Club. A recent English translation is \\"Water\\" (Mizu), appearing in Stories from the East, The East Publications, 1997. A partial translation of Watashi no T≈çky≈ç chizu (My Tokyo Map) appears in Tokyo stories: a literary stroll, University of California Press, 2002, Lawrence Rogers, editor. Her short story Iro no Nai E (\\"The Colorless Paintings\\") appears in Kenzaburo Oe's edited collection The Crazy Iris and Other Stories of the Atomic Aftermath. A native of Nagasaki, she did not experience the bombing, but through this story she shares her concern regarding the Hibakusha's (atomic bombing survivor) silence, though without being openly critical of it. Samuel Perry has translated her short story \\"White and Purple\\" , which won a William Sibley Memorial Translation Prize in 2012. In 2016, the University of Hawai'i Press also published Perry's collection of Sata translations, Five Faces of Japanese Feminism: Crimson and Other Works.

G. Wells. It describes the memoirs of an unnamed narrator in the suburbs of Woking, Surrey, England, who recounts an invasion of Earth by an army of Martians with military technology far in advance to human science. It is said to be the first story that details a human conflict with, and overall defeat by, an extraterrestrial race. Following its publication, The War of the Worlds rapidly entered popular culture. Through the 20th and 21st centuries, the novel has been adapted in various media, including radio, television and film. These have been produced with varying degrees of faithfulness to the original text, with many of the more famous adaptations, such as Orson Welles' 1938 radio adaptation and the 2005 film directed by Steven Spielberg, choosing to set the events in a contemporary setting. In addition, many adaptations, including both of the Americanised above, relocated the location from its original setting of the United Kingdom in favour of the United States. The most recent adaptation of this type was produced in Canada and broadcast on Britain's BBC (autumn 2013) and BBC America (summer 2014) for the centenary of World War I. It posits the Martian invasion as The Great Martian War 1913‚Äì1917, with the Martians invading Earth, first falling on Germany, and then expanding their war on mankind throughout Western Europe.

The radio drama itself has spun off a number of productions based upon the events surrounding the broadcast, including Doctor Who: Invaders from Mars, an audio drama released in 2002 based upon the Doctor Who television series that depicts Welles's broadcast as taking place during an actual attempted alien invasion.Big Finish Productions: Invaders from Mars 1953 first film adaptation by George Pal George Pal's film adaptation has many notable differences from H. G. Wells' novel. The closest resemblance is probably that of the antagonists. The film's aliens are indeed Martians, and invade Earth for the same reasons as those from the novel (the state of Mars suggests that it is in the final stages of being able to support life, leading to the Martians decision to make Earth their new home). They land on Earth in the same way, by crashing to the Earth. However, the book's spacecraft are large cylinder-shaped projectiles fired from the Martian surface from some kind of cannon, instead of the film's meteor-like spaceships; but the Martians emerge from their craft in the same way, by unscrewing a large, round hatch. They appear to have no use for humans in the film. In the novel they are observed directly feeding on humans by draining their victims' blood using pipettes; there is also a speculation about them eventually using human slaves to hunt down all remaining human survivors after the Martians conquer Earth. In the film the Martians do not bring the novel's fast-growing red weed with them, but they are defeated by Earth microorganisms, as observed in the novel. However, they die from the effects of the microorganisms within three days of the landing of the first meteor-ship; in the novel the Martians die within about three weeks of their invasion of England. The Martians themselves bear no physical resemblance to the novel's Martians. The novel's aliens are bear-sized, bulky creatures whose bodies are described as \\"merely heads\\", with a beak-like mouth, sixteen tentacles and two \\"luminous, disk-like eyes\\". Their film counterparts are short, reddish-brown creatures with two long, thin arms with three long suction cup-like fingers. The Martian's \\"head,\\" if it can be called that, is a broad \\"face\\" at the top-front of its broad shouldered upper torso, the only apparent feature of which is a single large eye with three distinctly colored lenses. The Martians' lower extremities, whatever they may be, are never shown. (Some speculative designs for the creature suggest the idea of three thin legs resembling their fingers, while others show them as a biped with short, stubby legs with three-toed feet.) The film's Martian war machines do actually have more of a resemblance than they may seem at first glance. The book's machines are Tripods and carry the heat-ray projector on an articulated arm connected to the front of the war machine's main body. The film's machines are deliberately shaped like manta rays, with a bulbous, elongated green window at the front, through which the aliens observe their surroundings. On top of the machine is the cobra-like heat-ray attached to a long, narrow, neck-like extension. They can be mistaken for flying-machines, but Dr. Forrester states that they are lifted by \\"invisible legs\\"; in one scene, when the first machine emerges, you can see faint traces of three energy legs beneath and three sparking traces where the three energy shafts touch the burning ground. Therefore, technically speaking, the film's war machines are indeed tripods, though they are never given that designation. Whereas the novel's war machines had no protection against British army and navy cannon fire, the film's war machines have a force field surrounding them; this invisible shield is described by Dr. Forrester as a \\"protective blister\\". The Martian weaponry is also partially unchanged. The heat-ray has the very same effect as that of the novel. However, the novel's heat-ray is briefly described as having a spinning disk held up by a mechanical arm when first seen; it fires in a wide arc while still in the pit where the Martians first land. The film's heat-ray is shaped like a cobra's hood with a single, red pulsing eye, which possibly acts like a targeting telescope for the Martians. The book describes another weapon, the black smoke used to kill all life; the war machines fire projectiles containing a black powder through a bazooka-like tube accessory. The black powder when dispersed seems to have the same effect on life as the mustard gas of the First World War. This weapon is replaced in the film by the \\"skeleton beam\\", which fires green pulsing bursts of energy from the tips of the Manta-Ray body. The skeleton beams cause objects and people to disintegrate. The plot of the film is very different from the novel. The novel tells the story of a late 19th-century journalist who journeys through Victorian London and environs while the Martians attack, eventually being reunited with his wife; the film's protagonist is a California scientist who falls in love with a college instructor after the Martian attack begins. However, certain points of the plot are similar to the novel, from the crash- landing of the Martian meteor-ships to their eventual defeat by Earth's microorganisms. Doctor Forrester also goes through some of which befalls the book's narrator: like his ordeal in a destroyed house and seeing an actual Martian up close. The film is given more of a Cold War theme, with its use of the Atomic Bomb against the enemy and the mass-destruction that such a global war would inflict on mankind. Unreleased adaptations After World War II, Ray Harryhausen shot a scene of a dying alien falling out of a Martian war machine, test footage for an abandoned project to adapt the story using Wells' original \\"octopus\\" concept for the Martians. A video of the footage can be found here.'War of the Worlds' ‚Äì Ray Harryhausen Martian test footage Here Harryhausen talks about his proposed adaptation: :\\"Yes, originally, after Mighty Joe [Young] I made a lot of sketches for War of the Worlds. I wanted to keep it in the period that H.G. Wells wrote it, of the Victorian period, and I made eight big drawings, some of which are published ‚Äì in the book and it would have been an interesting picture, if it was made years ago. But since then so many pictures of that nature have been made that it wouldn't be quite unique as it would have been.\\"Ray Harryhausen and Nick Park Sequels by other authors *Within six weeks of the novel's original 1897 magazine serialisation, The Boston Post began running a sequel, Edison's Conquest of Mars by Garrett P. Serviss, about an Earth counter-attack against the Martians, led by Thomas Edison. Though this is actually a sequel to 'Fighters from Mars', a revised and un-authorised re-print, they both were first printed in the Boston Post in 1898.Edison‚Äôs Conquest of Mars, \\"Foreword\\" by Robert Godwin, Apogee Books 2005 *The War of the Wenuses by E. V. Lucas and C. L. Graves (1898) is a parody of Wells's novel. In it London is invaded by Venusian women intent on raiding major department stores, notably Whiteley's. They can render men insensible using a 'mash-glance' (a 'masher' was period slang for an attractive young woman), so London's womenfolk resist them instead. *In 1962, Soviet author Lazar Lagin published a political pamphlet named \\"Major Well Andyou\\" (\\"–ú–∞–π–æ—Ä –í–µ–ª–ª –≠–Ω–¥—ä—é\\"), a pun on \\"Well, and you?\\", which relates the story of a major in the British Army who collaborates with the Martian invaders. A condemnation of imperialism and capitalism, the story was dominated by Soviet analysis of political issues contemporary to the 1950s and 1960s. *The Second War of the Worlds, by George H. Smith concerned the Martians trying to invade an alternate, less-technologically advanced Earth. Helping these people are an unnamed English detective, and his companion, a doctor, from 'our' world. (It is quite obvious from clues in the story that these are actually Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson.) *In the 1970s, Marvel Comics had a character named Killraven, Warrior of the Worlds who (in an alternative timeline) fought H. G. Wells' Martians after their second invasion of Earth in 2001. He first appeared in Amazing Adventures volume 2 #18. *Manly Wade Wellman and his son Wade Wellman wrote Sherlock Holmes' War of the Worlds (1975) which describes Sherlock Holmes's adventures during the Martian occupation of London. This version uses Wells' short story \\"The Crystal Egg\\" as a prequel (with Holmes being the man who bought the egg at the end) and includes a crossover with Arthur Conan Doyle's Professor Challenger stories. Among many changes the Martians are changed into simple vampires, who suck and ingest human blood. * In The Space Machine Christopher Priest presents both a sequel and prequel to The War of the Worlds (due to time travel elements), which also integrates the events of The Time Machine. *In the novel W. G. Grace's Last Case (1984) by Willie Rushton, W. G. Grace and Doctor Watson avert a second Martian invasion by attacking the Martian fleet on the far side of the moon with \\"bombs\\" containing influenza germs. *The comic book Scarlet Traces (2002) begins a decade later with Great Britain utilising the Martians' technology, and ironic to the allegory of Wells' novel, have become more powerful because of it. Eventually, this leads up to a counter-invasion aimed for Mars in its own sequel, Scarlet Traces: The Great Game (2006). *Science fiction author Eric Brown wrote a short story, \\"Ulla, Ulla\\" (2002) about an expedition to Mars, finding the truth behind H.G. Wells' novel. *The London Pen (La cage de Londres, 2003), by French-Canadian author Jean-Pierre Guillet, takes place one hundred years after a second successful Martian invasion. Humans are penned like cattle and ¬´milked¬ª regularly by their new masters, who feed on their blood. *Andrew Norris published Solar Pons' War of the Worlds in The Solar Pons Gazette (Volume 3.1, December 2008, pp. 19‚Äì33). In it Solar Pons, the Sherlock Holmes pastiche detective created by August Derleth, is involved, along with H.G. Wells, in a Martian invasion in 1938. *C. A, Powell's The Last Days of Thunder Child: Victorian Britain in chaos! (2013) tells the story from the perspective of the crew of HMS Thunder Child, here a pre-dreadnought rather than the torpedo ram in the original novel. A sequel, The Last Days of the Fighting Machine: The Martian Apocalypse of Victorian Britain (2019), tells the story of the fightback once the Martians start being weakened by disease, showing a variety of points of view, including members of the crew of a French warship. *Mike Brunton's War of the Worlds: The Anglo- Martian War of 1895 (Dark Osprey Book 9) is a 2015 pseudo-factual military history of the Martian invasion by a respected military history publisher. It sets the war at the time Wells wrote the novel, rather than in the early 20th century as specified by Wells in his book. *A number of people have written contemporaneously set stories that describe the same invasion from the perspectives of locations other than Britain. Notable stories of this type are: ** \\"Night of the Cooters\\" by Howard Waldrop, in which a Martian war machine lands in Texas. ** \\"Foreign Devils\\" by Walter Jon Williams, set in China. **War of the Worlds: Global Dispatches, edited by Kevin J. Anderson, an anthology of such stories (). ** \\"War of the Worlds : New Millennium\\" (2005) by Douglas Niles in which the invasion is set in 2005 and focuses mainly on the American fightback. () Tor Books * Kevin J. Anderson (writing as Gabriel Mesta) later wrote The Martian War: A Thrilling Eyewitness Account of the Recent Invasion As Reported by Mr. H.G. Wells (2006). It recounts the Martian invasion from a variety of viewpoints, and has ties to Wells's other work. *In the short story Mastery of Vesania, Hayden Lee uses his appropriation to present the invasion from the perspective of the Martian invaders, also providing the link between the different nature of the two invasions presented in the book and the 2005 film (arriving from space and rising from the ground). *Scott Washburn has written five novels between 2016 and 2019, starting with The Great Martian War: Invasion, about a second Martian invasion in 1909 and the resultant battlefronts. Much of this is set in the USA. * The New York Times best selling author, Stephen Baxter, has a novel-length sequel; entitled The Massacre of Mankind, released on 19 January 2017. He has also written a novella entitled The Martian in the Wood (also 2017). *Mark Gardner and John J. Rust's War of the Worlds: Retaliation (2017) posits a human invasion of Mars in 1924, using captured Martian technology and led by historical characters including George Patton, Erwin Rommel, Charles de Gaulle and Georgy Zhukov. *Indie author D.G.Leigh has written two novellas. \\"Sherlock Holmes Vs The War of the Worlds\\" (2015).https://www.amazon.co.uk/Massacre- Mankind-Sherlock-Holmes-Worlds- ebook/dp/B018OGP736/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1483401009&sr;=1-6&keywords;=The+Massacre+of+Mankind The original Wells' invasion as experienced by Mr Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson.

A sinister discovery in 1919 in book #2 'Lake On The Moon', reveals that our planet is in great peril from Red Weed first brought to Earth by the Martians. Following in the footsteps of the astronomer Ogilvy, Jack Stent adds to 'The Martian Diaries', as he embarks on a desperate space mission to find a cure for the Martian plague in book #3 'Gateway To Mars'.https://www.martiandiaries.com *The 2019 speculative fiction book Spacecraft of the First World War: A Compendium of Fighting Vessels of the Great Powers by William Flogg details a fictional alternate history stemming from the aftermath of the Martian invasion, in which humanity reverse- engineers the leftover Martian technology to create interplanetary warships, which are documented in the style of a fictional vessel encyclopedia.

Completed in 1892, it is a distinctive local example of Romanesque architecture, and served as a local firehouse until 1994. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. After standing unused for many years, rehabilitation of the property was contemplated by new ownership in 2013 and 2017. Description and history The Quinsigamond Firehouse is one of the institutional buildings making up the center of Quinsigamond village in southern Worcester; it stands on the east side of Blackstone River Road (formerly Millbury Street) across from the elementary school. It is a red brick structure, 2-1/2 stories in height, covered with a gable-on-hip roof. The main facade has a central equipment bay on the ground floor, flanked by slender windows and topped by a band of brownstone trim. The second floor has three central windows set in segmented- arch openings, flanked by single windows in round-arch openings. A wall dormer, with three windows in a Palladian arrangement, rises above, forming part of a parapet. The firehouse was designed by Patston & Lincoln and built in 1891-92 by O. C. Ward for $7,112. It is stylistically similar to two other fire stations that were built about the same time in the city, differing from them in the presence of the second story and gable window arrangement. The station remained in service until 1994, when a new district station was built on McKeon Street. The building has been vacant since then, with rehabilitation most recently proposed in 2017.
