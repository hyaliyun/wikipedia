Filippo Baldinucci stated that Cristoforo Rustici was Francesco's father but that is no longer accepted. In the period during which his son Francesco worked in his workshop, Vincenzo Rustici's hand was initially difficult to distinguish from that of his son.Gianni Papi, Gherardo delle Notti: Quadri bizarrissimi e cene allegre, Giunti Editore, p. 228-233 In December 1616, Vincenzo Rustici was commissioned to repaint three of the original fresco‚Äôs of Pinturicchio in the Chapel of Saint John the Baptist in the Siena Cathedral.‚Äô‚ÄôAlberto Aringhieri and the Chapel of Saint John the Baptist: Patronage, Politics, and the Cult of Relics in Renaissance Siena‚Äô‚Äô, ProQuest, 2002, p. 203 Work Vincenzo Rustici was a painter of history subjects as well as vedute, i.e. city views. He worked mainly in Siena, where his best-known works are preserved. Procession of the Contrade He is now mainly known for two canvases depicting respectively the Palio di Siena (a downtown horse race with bull hunt) and the Procession of the Contrade in the Piazza del Campo held on 15 August 1546 (Palazzo Salimbeni, Collection of the Banca Monte dei Paschi, Siena). These works provide an important record of these public festivities at the time. Vincenzo Rustici relied on a description in a contemporary letter by Cecchino Cartaio (‚ÄòCecchino the Stationer‚Äô) to create these canvases years after the events depicted in them occurred.Elizabeth MacKenzie Tobey, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Palio In Italian Renaissance Art, Thought, And Culture‚Äô‚Äô, Dissertation for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy, 2005, dissertation directed by Dr. Anthony Colantuono, Associate Professor of Art History. University of Maryland These paintings were originally preserved in the Villa del Poggio Imperiale in Florence, where they are documented as early as 1654. Rustici created a number of depictions of the Madonna and Child with saints, a subject popular with Sienese artists such as Casolani. An example is the Madonna and Child with Saints Augustine, John the Evangelist and Joseph (Sotheby's auction 9 June 2011 in New York, lot 31), which has been attributed to Rustici on stylistic grounds as the facial type of the Virgin corresponds closely to Vincenzo's signed Piet√† in Siena. Another example is the Madonna and Child with St John the Baptist, which appears to deliberately cite interpretations of the same theme by 15th century painters active in Siena such as the Master of the Story of Griselda.Vincenzo Rustici at liveauctioneers Notes External links Category:1556 births Category:1632 deaths Category:16th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Sienese painters Category:Italian Renaissance painters Category:Italian Baroque painters ","title":"Vincenzo Rustici"},{"id":"50408270","text":"Compounds of nickel are chemical compounds containing the element nickel which is a member of the group 10 of the periodic table. Most compounds in the group have an oxidation state of +2. Nickel is classified as a transition metal with nickel(II) having much chemical behaviour in common with iron(II) and cobalt(II). Many salts of nickel(II) are isomorphous with salts of magnesium due to the ionic radii of the cations being almost the same. Nickel forms many coordination complexes. Nickel tetracarbonyl was the first pure metal carbonyl produced, and is unusual in its volatility. Metalloproteins containing nickel are found in biological systems. Nickel forms simple binary compounds with non metals including halogens, chalcogenides, and pnictides. Nickel ions can act as a cation in salts with many acids, including common oxoacids. Salts of the hexaaqua ion (Ni2+) are especially well known. Many double salts containing nickel with another cation are known. There are organic acid salts. Nickel can be part of a negatively charged ion (anion) making what is called a nickellate. Numerous quaternary compounds (with four elements) of nickel have been studied for superconductivity properties, as nickel is adjacent to copper and iron in the periodic table can can form compounds with the same structure as the high-temperature superconductors that are known. Colour Most of the common salts of nickel are green due to the presence of hexaaquanickel(II) ion, Ni(H2O)62+. Geometry Nickel atoms can connect to surrounding atoms or ligands in a variety of ways. Six coordinated nickel is the most common and is octahedral, but this can be distorted if ligands are not equivalent. For four coordinate nickel arrangements can be square planar, or tetrahedral. Five coordinated nickel is rarer. Magnetism Some nickel compounds are ferromagnetic at sufficiently low temperatures. In order to show magnetic properties the nickel atoms have to be close enough together in the solid structure. Binary compounds A binary compound of nickel contains one other element. Substances that contain only nickel atoms are not actually compounds. In a noble gas matrix, nickel can form dimers, a molecule with two nickel atoms: Ni2. Ni2 has a bonding energy of 2.07¬±0.01 eV. For Ni2+ the bond energy is around 3.3 eV. Nickel dimers and other clusters can also be formed in a gas and plasma phase by shooting a powerful laser at a nickel rod in cold helium gas. journal=Chemical Physics Letters date=May 1991 volume=180 issue=3 pages=168‚Äì172 doi=10.1016/0009-2614(91)87135-Xbibcode=1991CPL...180..168L }} =Oxides= Nickel oxides include Nickel(II) oxide and Nickel(III) oxide. =Hydroxides= Nickel hydroxides are used in nickel‚Äìcadmium and Nickel‚Äìmetal hydride batteries.

Nickel silicides include Ni3Si, Ni31Si12, Ni2Si, Ni3Si2, NiSi and NiSi2. Nickel silicides are used in microelectronics. =Diatomic molecules= Hot nickel vapour reacting with other atoms in the gas phase can produce molecules consisting of two atoms. These can be studied by their emission spectrum. The nickel monohalides are well studied. Alloys Compounds of nickel with other metals can be called alloys. The substances with fixed composition include nickel aluminide (NiAl) melting at 1638¬∞ with hexagonal structure. NiY, NiY3, Ni3Y, Ni4Y, NiGd3, BaNi2Ge2 changes structure from orthorhombic to tetragonal around 480 ¬∞C. This is a ternary intermetallic compound.

These contain the hexaquanickel(II) ion. There is also an anhydrous form, a dihydrate and a tetrahydrate, the last two crystallised from sulfuric acid. The hexahydrate has two forms, a blue tetragonal form, and a green monoclinic form, with a transition temperature around 53 ¬∞C.Mellor pp462-465 The heptahydrate crystallises from water below 31.5 above this blue hexhydrate forms, and above 53.3 the green form.Mellor p 466-467 Heating nickel sulfate dehydrates it, and then 700¬∞ it loses sulfur trioxide, sulfur dioxide and oxygen. Other important nickel compounds in this class are nickel carbonate, nickel nitrate, and nickel phosphate =Fluoro acid salts= Nickel tetrafluoroborate, Ni(BF4)2 is very soluble in water, alcohol and acetonitrile. It is prepared by dissolving nickel carbonate in tetrafluoroboric acid. Nickel tetrafluoroberyllate NiBeF4‚Ä¢xH2O, can be hydrated with six or seven water molecules. Both nickel hexafluorostannate \\\\ce{NiSnF6.6H2O} and nickel fluorosilicate \\\\ce{NiSiF6.6H2O} crystallise in the trigonal system. Nickel hexafluorogermanate NiGeF6 has a rosy-tan colour and a hexagonal crystal with a = 5.241 √Ö unit cell volume is 92.9 √Ö3. It is formed in the reaction with GeF4 and K2NiF6.

It consists of green needles. =Nitrogen anion salts= Nickel cyanide tetrahydrate Ni(CN)2 is insoluble in water, but dissolves in aqueous ammonia. It forms double salts with interesting structures. Nickel azide Ni(N3)2 is a sensitive explosive. It can be made by treating nickel carbonate with hydrazoic acid. Acetone causes the precipitation of the hydrous solid salt, which is green. At 490K it slowly decomposes to nitrogen and nickel metal powder, losing a half of the nitrogen in four hours. Nickel azide is complexed by one azo group when dissolved in water, but in other solvents, the nickel atom can have up to four azo groups attached. Nickel azide forms a dihydrate: Ni(N3)2 and a basic salt called nickel hydroxy azide Ni(OH)N3. Nickel amide, Ni(NH2)2 is a deep red compound that contains Ni6 clusters surrounded by 12 NH2 groups. Nickel amide also forms a series of double salts. Other homoleptic nickel amides derived by substituting the hydrogen atoms are Ni[N(C6H5)2]2 (diphenyl) and boryl amides Ni[NBMes2Mes]2 and Ni[NBMes2C6H5]2. =Organic acid salts= Nickel forms many known salts with organic acids. In many of these the ionised organic acid acts as a ligand. Double salts Nickel is one of the metals that can form Tutton's salts. The singly charged ion can be any of the full range of potassium, rubidium, cesium, ammonium (NH4), or thallium. As a mineral the ammonium nickel salt, (NH4)2Ni(SO4)2, can be called nickelboussingaultite. With sodium, the double sulfate is nickelbl√∂dite Na2Ni(SO4)2 from the bl√∂dite family. Nickel can be substituted by other divalent metals of similar sized to make mixtures that crystallise in the same form. Nickel forms double salts with Tutton's salt structure with tetrafluoroberyllate with the range of cations of ammonia, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and thallium. Anhydrous salts of the formula M2Ni2(SO4)3, which can be termed metal nickel trisulfates, belong to the family of langbeinites. The known salts include (NH4)2Ni2(SO4)3, K2Ni2(SO4)3 and Rb2Ni2(SO4)3, and those of Tl and Cs are predicted to exist. Some minerals are double salts, for example Nickelzippeite Ni2(UO2)6(SO4)3(OH)10 ¬∑ 16H2O which is isomorphic to cobaltzippeite, magnesiozippeite and zinczippeite, part of the zippeite group. Double hydrides of nickel exist, such as Mg2NiH4. =Ternary chalcogenides= Nickel forms a series of double nickel oxides with other elements, which may be termed \\"nickelates\\". There are also many well defined double compounds with sulfur, selenium and tellurium. =Ternary pnictides= Ternary pnictides that contain nickel are metallic and include MgNi2Bi4, SrNi2P2, SrNi2As2, BaNi2P2, and BaNi2As2. =Ternary halides= Nickel can form anions and salts with halogens including the hexafluoronickelates, and tetrafluoronickelates, tetrachloronickelates, tetrabromonickelatess and tetraiodonickelates. The subiodide Bi12Ni4I3 is also known. =Polyoxometallates= Nickel can enter into metal oxygen clusters with other high oxidation state elements to form polyoxometalates. These may stabilize higher oxidation states of nickel, or show catalytic properties. Nonamolybdonickelate(IV), [NiMo9O32]6‚àí can oxidize aromatic hydrocarbons to alcohols. There is a dark brown heptamolybdonickelate(IV) potassium salt, K2H8NiMo7O28¬∑6H2O. 13-Vanadonickelate(IV) compounds such as K7NiV13O38 with black octahedral crystals exist. It can be made from isopolyvanadate, with nickel(II) oxidised by peroxydisulfate at a pH around 4. Nickel(IV) heteropolyniobates such as the dark maroon Na12NiNb12O38 are also known. An alternate orange red hydrate perhaps with 44 water molecules also exists. With nickel-II (tetramethylammonium)6[H3NiNb9O28 forms a green salt that is very soluble in water, but hardly soluble in ethanol. H43K14Na6Nb32 Ni10O183 is a nickel- cation-bridged polyoxoniobate which crystallizes in the monoclinic system with cell dimensions a=15.140 b=24.824 c=25.190 √Ö and Œ≤=103.469 and two formulas per unit cell. Na8Li12[Ni2(P2W15O56)2] forms a sandwich structure, and Na4Li5[Ni3(OH)3(H2O)3P2W16O59] is a Wells-Dawson polyoxometalate. Acid salts Nickel hydrofluoride, H5NiF7¬∑6H2O is made by using excess hydrofluoric acid solution on nickel carbonate. It is deep green. Basic salts Nickel oxyfluoride Ni4F4O(OH)2 is green. Nickelous enneaoxydiiodide 9NiO‚Ä¢Nil2 forms when solutions of nickel iodide are exposed to air and evaporated. Complexes Sample of potassium tetracyanonickelate hydrate Simple complexes of nickel include hexaquonickel(II), yellow tetracyanonickelate [Ni(CN)4]2‚àí, red pentacyanonickelate [Ni(CN)5]3‚àí only found in solution, [Ni(SCN)4]2‚àí and [Ni(SCN)6]4‚àí. Halo- complexes include [NiCl4]2‚àí, [NiF4]2‚àí, [NiF6]4‚àí, [NiCl2(H2O)4] [Ni(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+, [Ni(NH3)6]2+, [Ni(en)3)]2+. Some complexes have fivefold coordination. N[CH2CH2NMe2]3 (tris(N,N-dimethyl-2-aminoethyl)amine); P(o-C6H4SMe)3; P(CH2CH2CH2AsMe2)3. Other ligands for octahedral coordination include PPh3, PPh2Me and thiourea. Nickel tetrahedral complexes are often bright blue and 20 times or more intensely coloured than the octahedral complexes. The ligands can include selections of neutral amines, arsines, arsine oxides, phosphines or phosphine oxides and halogens. Several nickel atoms can cluster together in a compound with other elements to produce nickel cluster complexes. One example where nickel atoms form a square pyramid is a nickel hydride cluster complexed by triphenyl phosphine ligands and bonding a hydrogen atom on each edge. Another example has a square planar Ni4H4 shape in its core. Nickel bis(dimethylglyoximate), an insoluble red solid is important for gravimetric analysis. Bio molecules Active site of Nickel superoxide dismutase Cofactor F430 contains nickel in a tetrapyrrole derivative, and is used in the production of methane. Some hydrogenase enzymes contain a nickel-iron cluster as an active site in which the nickel atom is held in place by cysteine or selenocysteine. Plant ureases contain a bis-Œº-hydroxo dimeric nickel cluster. CO-methylating acetyl-CoA synthase contains two active nickel atoms, one is held in a square planar coordination by two cysteine and two amide groups, and the other nickel is held by three sulfur atoms. It is used to catalyse the reduction of carbon monoxide to acetyl-CoA. Nickel superoxide dismutase (or Ni-SOD) from Streptomyces contains six nickel atoms. The nickel holding is done by a \\"nickel binding hook\\" which as the amino acid pattern H2N-His-Cys-X- X-Pro-Cys-Gly-X-Tyr-rest of protein, where the bold bits are ligands for the nickel atom. Nickel transporter proteins exist to move nickel atoms in the cell. in E. coli these are termed NikA, NikB, NikC, NikD, NikE. In order to come through a cell membrane a nickel permease protein is used. In Alcaligenes eutrophus the gene for this is hoxN. Organometallics Well known nickel organometalic (or organonickel) compounds include Nickelocene, bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) and nickel tetracarbonyl. Nickel Nickel tetracarbonyl was the first discovered organonickel compound. It was discovered that carbon monoxide corroded a nickel reaction chamber valve. And then that the gas coloured a bunsen burner flame green, and then that a nickel mirror condensed from heating the gas. The Mond process was thus inspired to purify nickel. The Nickel tetracarbonyl molecule is tetrahedral, with a bond length for nickel to carbon of 1.82 √Ö. Nickel tetracarbonyl easily starts breaking apart over 36¬∞ forming Ni(CO)3, Ni(CO)2, and Ni. Ni(CO) and NiC appear in mass spectroscopy of nickel carbonyl. There are several nickel carbonyl cluster anions formed by reduction from nickel carbonyl. These are [Ni2(CO)5]2‚àí, dark red [Ni3(CO)8]2‚àí, [Ni4(CO)9]2‚àí, [Ni5(CO)9]2‚àí, [Ni6(CO)12]2‚àí. Salts such as Cd[Ni4(CO)9] and Li2[Ni3(CO)8]‚Ä¢5acetone can be crystallised. Mixed cluster carbonyl anions like [Cr2Ni3(CO)16]2‚àí, [Mo2Ni3(CO)16]2‚àí and [W2Ni3(CO)16]2‚àí [Mo4(CO)14]2‚àí can form salts with bulky cations like tetraethylammonium. The brown [NiCo3(CO)11]‚àí changes to red [Ni2Co4(CO)14]2‚àí. With oxygen or air the explosive Ni(CO)3O2 can be formed from nickel carbonyl. Yet other ligands can substitute for carbon monoxide in nickel carbonyl. These lewis base ligands include triphenylphosphine, triphenoxyphosphine, trimethoxyphosphine, tributylphosphine, triethoxyphosphine, triethylisonitrolphosphine, triphenylarsine, and triphenylstibine. Nickel forms dark blue planar complexes with 1,2-Diimino-3,5-cyclohexadiene or bisacetylbisaniline [(C6H5N-C(CH3)=)2]2Ni. Another planar bis compound of nickel is formed with phenylazothioformamide C6H5N=NC(S)NR2, and dithizone C6H5N=NC(S)NHNHC6H5. tetrasulfur tetranitride when reduced with nickel carbonyl makes Ni[N2S2H]2 also coloured dark violet. One nickellabenzene is known where nickel substitutes for carbon in benzene. At nickel the plane of the molecule is bent, however the connection to the ring has aromatic character. =Alkoxy compounds= Nickel tert-butoxide Ni[OC(CH3)3]2 is coloured violet. It is formed in the reaction of di-tert- butylperoxide with nickel carbonyl. Nickel dimethoxide is coloured green. There are also nickel chloride methoxides with formulae: NiClOMe, Ni3Cl2(OMe)4 and Ni3Cl(OMe)5 in which Nickel and oxygen appear to form a cubane-type cluster. Other alkoxy compounds known for nickel include nickel dipropoxide, nickel di-isopropoxide, nickel tert-amyloxide, and nickel di-tert-hexanoxide. These can be formed by crystallising nickel chloride from the corresponding alcohol, which forms an adduct. This is then heated with a base. Nickel(II) alkoxy compounds are polymeric and non-volatile. Ziegler catalysis uses nickel as a catalyst. In addition it uses diethylaluminum ethoxide, phenylacetylene and triethylaluminium It converts ethylene into 1-butene. It can dimerise propylene. The catalyst, when combined with optically active phosphines, can produce optically active dimers. An intermediate formed is tris(ethylene)nickel.(CH2=CH2)3Ni in which the ethylene molecules connect to the nickel atom side on. Homoletptic bimetallic alkoxides have two different metals, and the same alkoxy group. They include Ni[(Œº‚àíOMe)3AlOMe]2, Ni[Al(OBut)4]2 (nickel tetra-tert-butoxyaluminate) and Ni[Al(OPri)4]2. (nickel tetra-isopropoxyaluminate a pink liquid) Potassium hexaisoproxynoibate and tantalate can react with nickel chloride to make Ni[Nb(OPri)6]2 and Ni[Ta(OPri)6]2. Ni[Zr2(OPri)9]2 The bimetallic alkoxides are volatile and can dissolve in organic solvents. A trimetallic one exists [Zr2(OPri)9]Ni[Al(OPri)4]. NiGe(OBut)8], NiSn(OBut)8] and NiPb(OBut)8] are tricyclic. [Ni2(Œº3‚àíOEt)2(Œº‚àíOEt)8Sb4(OEt)6] Heteroleptic bitmetallic ethoxides have more than one variety of alkoxy group, e.g. Ni[(Œº‚àíOPri)(Œº‚àíOBut)Al(OBut)2]2 which is a purple solid. Oxoalkoxides contain extra oxygen in addition to the alcohol. With only nickel, none are known, but with antimony an octanuclear molecule exists [Ni5Sb3(Œº4‚àíO)2(Œº3‚àíOEt)3(‚àíOEt)9(OEt)3(EtOH)4]. =Aryloxy compounds= There are many nickel compounds with the formula template Ni(OAr)XL2 and Ni(OAr)2L2. L is a ligand with phosphorus or nitrogen atoms. OAr is a phenol group or O- attached to an aromatic ring. Often an extra molecule of the phenol is hydrogen bonded to the oxygen attached to nickel. =Œº-bonded molecules= Others include cyclododecatriene nickel. =Sulfur rings= Nickel bis- dithiobenzoate can form a violet coloured sodium salt. Two bisperfluoromethyl-l,2-dithietene molecules react with nickel carbonyl to make a double ring compound with nickel linked to four sulfur atoms. This contains four trifluoromethyl groups and is dark purple. Instead of this methyl or phenyl can substitute. These can be made by substituted acetylenes with sulfur on nickel carbonyl, or on nickel sulfide. Bis-diphenyldithiene nickel has a planar structure =Nickel chalcogen cluster compound= A hexameric compound [Ni(SR)2]6 is produced in the reaction of nickel carbonyl with dialkyl sulfides (RSR). Nickel can be part of a cubane-type cluster with iron and chalcogens. The metal atoms are arranged in a tetrahedron shape, with the sulfur or selenium making up another tetrahedron that combines to make a cube. For example, the [NiFe3S4(PPh3)(SEt)3]2‚àí is a dianion that has a tetraethyl ammonium salt. Similar ion clusters are [NiFe3Se4(PPh3)(SEt)3]2‚àí and [NiFe3Se4(SEt)4]3‚àí. In the natural world cube shaped metal sulfur clusters can have sulfur atoms that are part of cysteine. [Ni4Se23]4‚àí has a cube with Ni4Se4 at its core, and then the nickel atoms are bridge across the cube faces by five Se3 chains and one Se4 chain. It is formed as a tetraethylammonium salt, from Li2Se, Se, NEt4Cl and nickel dixanthate in dimethylformamide as a solvent. This reaction also produces (NEt4)2Ni(Se4)2. =Nitrosyl compounds= When liquid nickel carbonyl is dissolved in liquid hydrogen chloride, it can react with nitrosyl chloride to form a dimer Ni(NOCl)2. This then decomposes to Ni(NO)Cl2, which is polymeric. Nickel carbonyl reacting with nitric oxide yields blue coloured mononitrosyl nickel NiNO. With cyclohexane as well, pale blue Ni(NO2)NO is produced with nitrous oxide as a side product. With cyclopentadiene as well, œÄ-C5H5NiNO is produced.

He was previously the Minister of Culture and Heritage, and Minister of Knowledge and Human Talent. Long later became Ecuador's Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva, before resigning in January 2018 over strong disagreements with President Moreno. Early life and education Long was born in Cr√©teil, a suburb of Paris, France, in 1977, to a French mother and a British father. He completed his studies at the University of London, where he earned a Ph.D. at the Institute for the Study of the Americas, a Masters in Political Science and a Bachelor in History at the School of Oriental and African Studies. Long first went to Latin America at the age of 18 and spent some extended time traveling in Central America before arriving in Ecuador in 1996. Political career Guillaume Long with Mark Weisbrot (left) and Eric LeCompte (right) After completing his Ph.D., Long taught history and international relations in several Ecuadorian universities.http://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/politica/2/guillaume-long- es-el-nuevo-ministro-de-cultura His political career started when he became advisor to the National Secretary of Planning and Development Ren√© Ram√≠rez Gallegos. Long also became a member of the Academic Board of the Instituto de Altos Estudios Nacionales (IAEN; ), and later became its dean.http://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/informacion-general/1/presidente- correa-nombra-a-guillaume-long-como-rector-del-iaen In September 2011, President Correa appointed Long as a member of the \\"Consejo de Evaluaci√≥n, Acreditaci√≥n y Aseguramiento de la Calidad de la Educaci√≥n Superior\\" (CEAACES). The members of the CEAACES eventually elected Long as their President. His task, as mandated by the new Constitution and by the Law of Higher Education, was to guarantee a minimal degree of quality in Ecuador's universities and to close down those establishments, often referred to as garage universities, considered too precarious to offer higher education degrees. Some of them were seen as incurring in the outright sale of degrees or not upholding the most elementary academic standards expected from an institution of higher education. In April 2012, Long announced the closure of 14 sub-standard universities, in a polemic decision that meant that almost 10% of the total student population was affected. Students whose universities were closed down were later enrolled on a scheme to be reinserted in the remainder of Ecuador's higher education institutions.http://www.ecuadorinmediato.com/Noticias/news_user_view/guillaume_long_fue_electo_como_presidente_del_ceaaces --156797http://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/sociedad/4/catorce- universidades-categoria-e-fueron-suspendidas-definitivamente On 6 May 2013, Long was named Coordinating Minister for Knowledge and Human Talent. His role was to oversee the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology, the Ministry of Culture and Heritage, as well as a number of public research institutes and other state entities. From this post, Long was one of the key promoters of the creation of four high standard universities in Ecuador: Ikiam located in the Amazon and essentially focused on life sciences; Yachay University, a university located at the heart of a science, technology and innovation cluster; Unae, a large-scale teacher's training university for primary and secondary teachers; and Uniartes, a university for the arts located in the historic center of Guayaquil. On 25 March 2015, Correa appointed Long as Minister of Culture and Heritage, a post he held until March 2016. Long dedicated much of this his efforts as Minister of Culture to passing a new and long overdue Law of Culture mandated by the 2008 Constitution.http://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/columnistas/1/el- lento-largo-y-sinuoso-camino-de-la-ley-de-cultura Between May 2014 and March 2016, Long was chairman of the International Relations Committee of PAIS Alliance, a socialist political movement led by Correa. He was the chief organizers of two conferences (ELAP I and ELAP II) that brought to Quito leftist political parties and movements from Latin America and to world. The chosen date was 30 September, the anniversary of the failed police uprising/coup against Correa in 2010. As Foreign Minister On 3 March 2016, Long became Ecuador's new Minister of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility. His time at the helm of Ecuador's foreign policy was marked by the 16 April 2016 earthquake and the channeling of the international aid and relief efforts. It was also marked by the crisis of UNASUR and CELAC and the regional divisions and tensions over Venezuela, with Long recurrently insisting on the need for dialogue and clashing over this issue with OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro at the 45th session of the OAS General Assembly in June 2016.http://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/mundo/america- latina/article87089467.html Long played an important role in the establishment of peace talks between the Colombian Government and the ELN guerrillas in Quito, Ecuador, and in the humanitarian steps that were taken in 2016 and 2017 to pave the way for the start of the formal negotiations on 7 February 2017, including the release of ELN prisoners from Colombian jails and of several people held in captivity by the ELN. Long played a leading role in seeking regional consensus in Latin America to demand that the United States put an end to the Wet feet, dry feet policy that favored and incentivized Cuban migration, affecting both the security and human rights of the migrants and the stability of transit countries. During Long's term, Ecuador was elected Chair of the Group of 77 for the first time in its history. Long made the most of the scandal of the Panama Papers and Correa's calling for a referendum over barring civil servants from holding assets in tax havens, and made the struggle against tax evasion a cornerstone of Ecuador's foreign policy and a core theme during his term as foreign minister. Long recurrently pressed this matter whether at the helm of the G77 or in other multilateral fora. In November 2016, during Long's term as Foreign Minister, President Xi Jinping visited Ecuador in the first State-visit of a President of the People's Republic of China to the South American country. This was a high-profile visit and it further consolidated the close relations between China and Ecuador fostered during Correa's presidencyhttp://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-11/19/c_135842875.htm During Long's time at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the case of Julian Assange gained renewed global prominence. In December 2016, Assange was finally questioned in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by Ecuadorian and Swedish prosecutors. In May 2017, the Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny announced that she was dropping the case against Assange. This was hailed as a great victory for Assange and bolstered Ecuador's international position and its justification of its granting of the political asylum. Long had been active in international circles pressing for a denouement to the Assange issue, including a letter to his Swedish counterpart in which he argued that the delays of the Swedish prosecution and absence of charges amounted to a miscarriage of justice. In November 2016, Long also oversaw the cutting off of Assange's internet connection during the US presidential elections. Ecuador's Ministry of Foreign Affairs argued that it refused to meddle in other countries' internal affairs particularly in times of elections, but that this measure bore no relations with the asylum.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ecuador-cuts-off-internet-access- for-wikileaks-founder- assange/2016/10/18/277281f6-95ac-11e6-9b7c-57290af48a49_story.html Long was also in charge of Ecuador's oil negotiations within OPEC and represented Ecuador at the OPEC meetings in Algiers on 29 September 2016 and Vienna on 30 November 2016, and the 10 December 2016 OPEC-non OPEC meeting in Vienna that resulted in the commitment to cut oil production by just under 1.8 million barrels a day.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-11-30/ecuador- foreign-minister-long-on-opec-output- dealhttps://www.ft.com/content/98f3bf56-b6e6-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62?mhq5j=e1http://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/economia/8/autoridades- de-ecuador-recibieron-a-secretario-general-de-la-opep After the election of Donald Trump in the United States, and the threat of an increase in the deportations of Ecuadorians, Long also implemented a \\"contingency plan\\" in support of Ecuadorian migrants. Ambassador to the UN The new President of Ecuador, Lenin Moreno, named Long the Permanent Representative of Ecuador to the United Nations in Geneva. Long‚Äôs stint at the head of the diplomatic mission is mostly marked by his leadership of the working group on the elaboration of a treaty on transnational corporations and human rights, a subject on which he is actively involved. In January 2018, Long resigned from his position in a public letter to Moreno, in which he denounces the new government unconstitutional measures and its betrayal of the ideals and program of the Citizen‚Äôs Revolution on which the new government was elected. Criticism Long was heavily criticized, notably by former Ecuadorian foreign ministers, for being the first non Ecuadorian-born Foreign Minister. During the unrest in Venezuela throughout 2016 and in the first half of 2017, there was recurrent criticism that Long was not being hard enough on the Maduro Government and should take a more forceful stance in line with most other Latin American countries in the region outside of ALBA. This issue played an important role in Ecuadorian domestic politics. In one of his weekly editorials, former Foreign Minister Francisco Carri√≥n claimed that Long had said that \\"one breathes happiness\\" in Venezuela. Long denounced this as a lie and pushed Carri√≥n to prove these had been his words. Unable to do so, Carri√≥n was eventually forced to apologize on Twitter.http://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/politica/2/guillaume-long- acepta-disculpa-de-articulista-de-el-comercio During the elections of 2017, Long said that there was an attempt to influence the population \\"with the argument that Ecuador is going to become like Venezuela. (‚Ä¶) Well no, Ecuador is not Venezuela‚Äù. This declaration was the Ecuadorian Government's clearest attempt thus far to distance itself from the Venezuelan crisis.http://www.el- nacional.com/noticias/latinoamerica/gobierno-rafael-correa-dice-que-ecuador- venezuela_88349 Business sectors but also certain factions within Correa's government complained that Long, along with other senior officials in the Correa administration, opposed the free trade agreement between Ecuador, Colombia and Peru, and the European Union, which Ecuador finally adhered to in December 2016. He and others were considered to be the \\"enemy within\\".http://www.expreso.ec/economia/la-dura-lucha-contra-un-enemigo- interno-DN807612 See also *List of foreign ministers in 2017 *List of current foreign ministers * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD6UQVCnKC0 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX1lww1m7gw References Category:1977 births Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:Ecuadorian people of British descent Category:Ecuadorian people of French descent Category:Ecuadorian politicians Category:Foreign ministers of Ecuador Category:Living people Category:PAIS Alliance politicians Category:Alumni of the School of Advanced Study Category:Politicians from Paris ","title":"Guillaume Long"},{"id":"50408349","text":"Way Ratai is a district of Pesawaran Regency, Lampung Province, Indonesia.

The property, more than includes a farmhouse dating to the 1790s, which was the seat of Simeon Smith, a prominent local doctor, politician, and landowner. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history The Simeon Smith Mansion stands in a rural area of eastern West Haven, on the west side of Smith (or Doran) Road, a gravel road extending south from Main Road, a short way west of Vermont Route 22A. The main house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, end chimneys, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. A single-story ell extends to the rear. Across the front stands a monumental two-story Colonial Revival portico, with a shed roof supported by Tuscan columns, some grouped in closely spaced pairs. The facade sheltered by this portico is five bays wide, with a center entrance set in a moulded surround that has narrow sash windows (two panes wide) on either side. The interior follows a traditional Georgian central hall plan, with two rooms on each side of a center hallway. The front rooms exhibit a combination of period 18th- century finishes and alterations made during a major 1937 update of the structure. The property was purchased in 1789 by Simeon Smith, and the house was probably built not long afterward. Smith had moved to the area in 1783 from northwestern Connecticut. This house was built for him by William Sprat (or Sprats), a Connecticut builder who spent his later years in this area, and is buried in a West Haven cemetery next to Simeon Smith. Smith was a prominent early settler of the area, and made a significant fortune speculating in land, in addition to providing medical services, serving as a local probate judge and in the state legislature.

It is part of Erlau municipality.  Geography  Schweikershain is situated about 4.5 km north of Erlau, 8 km north of Mittweida, 8 km southwest of Waldheim and 5 km southeast of Geringswalde, in the Central Saxon Loess Hill Country, spreading in an east-western direction along a stream which feeds some ponds in the eastern part of the village. The road between Geringswalde and Mittweida intersects the village slightly west of its centre.  History  The area was colonised in the 14th century by Thuringian and Franconian settlers. A church was already mentioned in 1346, Schweikershain proper was first mentioned in writing in 1428 as Swykirschayn.CODEX DIPLOMATICUS SAXONIA REGIA (Second part, vol. III, p. 115, No. 924, Leipzig 1867) It was founded as a Waldhufendorf The name probably referred to the founder. Kunz von Kaufungen was enfeoffed with the local manor from 1449 to 1451. In 1544 it was acquired by the family von Carlowitz, 1718 it passed into the hands of the family von Wallwitz in whose possession it remained until 1945. A new church was built in 1719. A first schoolhouse was built in 1811. In 1852 the construction of a railway station on the Riesa‚ÄìChemnitz railway started. A new school which is still in use was opened in 1893. The village was connected to the electricity network in 1911. Schweikershain was under the jurisdiction of Amt Rochlitz until the middle of the 19th century. When the judicial powers of the lord of the manor were abrogated in 1855, the court of law in Geringswalde became responsible for the village. Later the village became part of Amtshauptmannschaft D√∂beln (later Kreis D√∂beln) until 1952 when it was passed back into Kreis Rochlitz. It shared the history of the latter, passing to Landkreis Mittweida in 1994 and to Landkreis Mittelsachsen in 2008. In 1947 the manor house was turned into a recreation home for tuberculosis patients and in 1959 into a retirement home. The first agricultural cooperative was founded in 1953. The school was extended in 1959 and became a ten-year Polytechnic Secondary School in 1964. After the German reunification Schweikershain, together with Crossen, Milkau, and Beerwalde, joined Erlau municipality. The school has been transformed into a school for children with special educational needs in 1997.  Buildings  Church in Schweikershain The church of 1719 still houses a Gothic church tabernacle coming from the medieval predecessor building. In 1759, a pipe organ made by Gottfried Silbermann was erected on the choir gallery. The watermill, in 1702 used to grind corn and also as a sawmill, was rebuilt in 1810 and electrified in 1937. It stopped production in 1959, the associated bakery in 1971. In 1992/1993 the building was converted to house guest rooms, apartments and a meeting room, in 1999 the register office of Erlau was established there, too.  Transportation  Schweikershain railway station Schweikershain has a station on the railway line between Riesa and Chemnitz, located about 1 km south of the village on the boundary of Erlau and Mittweida municipalities. Hourly services on weekdays and two-hourly services on weekends offer connections to Chemnitz and Riesa, most of them running to and from Elsterwerda. On weekdays, Schweikershain is served by buses of Verkehrsverbund Mittelsachsen running between Geringswalde and Mittweida.

Early life Walter Scott was born in Glasgow in May 1947. He attended Eastwood High School and then went to Edinburgh University where he gained a first-class honours degree in Natural Philosophy (Physics) in 1969 and went on to obtain a Ph.D in at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1972, researching theoretical particle physics at the Cavendish Laboratory. During this time he developed a life-long interest in the college's boat club and in rowing generally. Investment management =Ivory and Syme= As a nuclear physicist Scott decided that, although he was a capable researcher, he was in competition with potential Nobel Prize winners and he was in a profession that was not very well paid. He decided would change career to be in the financial services industry. In 1972 Scott started to work for Ivory and Sime in Edinburgh and he eventually led their pension fund business. From there, after becoming a target for attempted head-hunting, he decided he could do better running his own business. =Walter Scott and Partners= In 1983 he left Ivory and Syme to found Walter Scott and Partners with two other partners. It was a global equity management firm which became a private limited company. Rather than trying to produce growth forecasts, the focus was on understanding why some companies grow. The portfolio never contained more than fifty companies, held taking a long-term view. This approach was particularly appealing to a number of American clients and he found it helpful to emphasize the firm's Scottishness ‚Äì wearing a kilt could be impressive. With about sixty staff, the partnership was decidedly up-market. For the 2003‚Äì2004 tax year the business made pre-tax profits of ¬£8 million on a turnover of ¬£18 million and Scott personally was estimated to be worth ¬£62 million with an income of ¬£100,000 a week. In 2006 the firm held 3.3 per cent (89 million shares) in Morrisons. In May 2006 Scott sold the business to Mellon (later to become BNY Mellon) for between ¬£250 million and ¬£500 million and resigned as director next year. Scott had been one of three shareholders and had owned 70 per cent of the shares. At the time the business was managing ¬£14.3 billion of assets. linked to from =Scott Investment Partners= With two other partners in 2013, after a period of \\"retiral\\", Scott established Scott Investment Partners LLP, also a global equity management firm, based in Henley-on-Thames. Personal life Scott is married to Rosemary and they have three children. As well as rowing, he states his interests to be aviation (he has a pilot's licence), classic cars, gardening, and \\"rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll\\". He is a member of the Leander Club, New York Athletic Club, and Monaco Yacht Club. He is an honorary fellow of Trinity Hall and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Scott is often described in the press as secretive or reclusive and avoids being photographed, but he is well known in the financial world and is \\"rather flamboyant\\" and ostentatious in his lifestyle. In 2011 he publicly debated anthropogenic climate change with Brian Hoskins, ‚Äì while agreeing that the climate is changing he expressed doubts about the rate and period of time for the change and whether human activity has been involved. In 2010 he donated ¬£1 million to the National Museums Scotland as a contribution to its refurbishment plans and there is a gallery named after him. At the time his own wealth was estimated to be about ¬£150 million. As well as living on the C√¥te d'Azur, Scott has a home at Henley-on-Thames where he is a supporter of the Henley Royal Regatta. He has rowed for Upper Thames Rowing Club veterans. He purchased from Cambridge University Boat Club Amaryllis, the 50-foot umpire's launch built by Hobbs and Sons in 1928, and had it restored to again be in use at Henley for umpires and supporters. Amaryllis was later used as the model for four new launches. Charlotte Square Scott is credited with restoring several properties in Charlotte Square in Edinburgh. In 1996 Scott's firm purchased 9, Charlotte Square in Edinburgh, one of the grandest squares in the city's New Town and the location of the official residence of Scotland's First Minister. By 2002 his had purchased nine more properties in the square, using 1, Charlotte Square for the firm's headquarters. It had cost ¬£35 million to purchase and renovate the ten town houses. quoting He did not view the purchases as being a commercial venture: \\"I believe Charlotte Square is the finest Georgian square in Europe, it was the best financial-legal address in Europe ... that is why I will be delighted to take my firm into it and return to the city‚Äôs centre of gravity.

He is probably best known for his work in nonparametric statistics, where he has a test named after him: Jonckheere's trend test. Early life Observatory at Hem (photo from around 1909) where Jonckheere was born Jonckheere was born in Hem, near Lille in France, in a house attached to an observatory. His father was Robert Jonckh√®ere, a French astronomer known for discovering 3350 double stars. Jonckheere took a first class degree in psychology with statistics in 1949 and a PhD in 1956, both from UCL. Work Jonckheere is probably best known for his work in nonparametric statistics, approaches which make fewer assumptions about the theoretical distribution of the data than parametric statistics. In this field he developed what is now known as Jonckheere's trend test, a method which is implemented in SPSS, a statistical package favoured by social scientists, and R, widely used by statisticians.See the DescTools package; Andri Signorell, et al. (2016). DescTools: Tools for descriptive statistics. R package version 0.99.16. He published little; however, he influenced many people's ideas and work, with traces of conversations and advice throughout UCL and beyond. Jonckheere visited and left his mark at the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva, where Jean Piaget forbade him from leaving unless he could find an equally able replacement. Jonckheere coauthored a book with Piaget and Benoit Mandelbrot on mental development.Jonckeere, A.; Mandelbrot, B.; Piaget, J. 1958.La lecture de l'exp√©rience. Paris, Presses universitaires de France. (Etudes d'√©pist√©mologie g√©n√©tique, V.) Other people Jonck worked with or was associated with include J. B. S. Haldane, A. J. Ayer, Cyril Burt, Hans Eysenck, and Ernst Gombrich. Robert John Audley's (1956) University of London PhD thesis acknowledgement illustrates the kind of support which was common from Jonckheere; Audley writes that \\"much of the thesis is the result of long periods of almost daily argument with him.\\" The fruits of this collaboration led to the Audley-Jonckheere stochastic model of learning. This also illustrates one of Jonckheere's main loves, applying mathematical analysis to psychological science. But Jonckheere's interests were much broader than mathematics. For example, although he worked at (what is now) the UCL Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, he also gave lectures at the Slade School of Fine Art there, one of the top art schools in the UK. He earned a reputation for devouring books and being able to talk with assurance on a broad range of topics.

The book explores the changing social, economical and cultural landscape of the United Kingdom in the early 21st century. It is connected to Coe's previous novel What a Carve Up!, through shared themes and references to characters and events from the latter. Plot summary The book comprises five parts with interconnected plot lines and multiple points of view. The Black Tower takes place in rural Yorkshire in 2003, soon after the invasion of Iraq and the death of David Kelly. It follows the beginning of the friendship between ten- year-old girls Rachel and Alison as they try to decipher mysterious happenings around the village where Rachel's grandparents live. The Comeback is set in 2011 and focuses on Alison and her mother Val, now living in Birmingham. Alison, estranged from Rachel due to a misunderstanding after coming out as gay to her, is trying to form new relationships. Val, a former one-hit-wonder singer and a librarian facing reduced working hours, is offered the chance to appear on a reality show, which she accepts in the hopes of reviving her career. Although she gets along with the other participants, the footage is heavily edited to paint her in a bad light, leading to a hugely negative response from the audience. Alison watches horrified as her mother is made to undertake very unpleasant and humiliating tasks, until she returns home traumatised. The Crystal Garden follows Laura, a lecturer at Oxford University. Over the course of a weekend in 2011, she tells Rachel, now a student there, the story of her recently deceased husband's obsession with a short film he had seen as a child, and how the search for it led to his death. The Winshaw Prize is the story of how young policeman Nathan Pilbeam tries to find the connection between the apparently accidental deaths of two comedians. His approach, which advocates understanding the political and social context of a crime, allows him to not only predict the next target but identify the killer, a man who believes that comedy is making people complacent and is a danger to democracy. In What a Whopper!, Rachel is hired as a private tutor for the children of a very rich family. She lives in their house in Kensington, in a section reserved for staff, while work to build an extravagant eleven-level basement to the house is being undertaken. She meets Laura again, who has a new post trying to promote humanitarian values in a financial organisation. A chance encounter with Val, who now has to attend food banks for sustenance, leads to her reconnecting with Alison, serving a brief term in prison after being framed for benefit fraud. At the same time, secondary characters from throughout the novel who are wealthy residents of the area mysteriously go missing, with a promoted Pilbeam researching the case. Rachel struggles to understand and adapt to her employers' mentality, lifestyle and activities, which, along with personal difficulties, culminates in her having a breakdown. The final chapters show that Rachel, Alison and Val are recovering from their problems, while the missing people are implied to have been abducted in retribution for their past behaviour. Critical reception In a review for the Financial Times, Suzi Feay described the novel as \\"a richly enjoyable, densely textured and thought-provoking entertainment\\". In The Scotsman, Allan Massie wrote a good review, concluding that \\"one should be grateful for any novel which, like this one, is devoted to the great cause of cheering us all up, no matter how indignant the author may often be.\\" Meanwhile, Erica Wagner of the New Statesman concluded that while the novel could be seen as preachy, it makes good points about London under austerity measures. However, Robert Epstein of The Independent deplored that the novel was \\"too obvious, both in its targets and in their subsequent takedown\\". In The London Evening Standard, Andrew Neather conceded that the novel was \\"first-class entertainment\\", but he lamented that it did not live up to a proper satire. Reviewing it for The Guardian, Alex Clark called it \\"a political novel\\" as well as an \\"interrogation of the purposes and efficacy of humour in exposing society‚Äôs ills, and a spoof on horror B-movies\\" References Category:2015 British novels Category:English-language novels Category:British satirical novels Category:Novels by Jonathan Coe ","title":"Number 11 (novel)"},{"id":"50409050","text":"The Oakham Farm is a historic farm at 23226 Oakham Farm Lane, near Middleburg in Loudoun County, Virginia.

At 8 years of age she was the runner-up in the All- around rhythmic gymnastics in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. Gaudio made her international debut in competitions at 14 years of age, since then she has represented her nation at international competitions. At the 2014 South American Games, Gaudio won the all-around silver medal behind teammate Ang√©lica Kvieczynski, in the apparatus finals; she won gold in ball, clubs, silver in ribbon and bronze in hoop. She competed at the 2015 Pan American Games where she finished 8th in the all-around, an improvement from her 10th- place finish at the 2011 Pan American Games. Gaudio has competed at world championships including at the 2014 and at the 2015 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships where she was the highest ranked Brazilian rhythmic gymnast ahead of teammate Ang√©lica Kvieczynski. Gaudio also competed at the 2016 Gymnastics Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro and qualified through a wildcard entry for the 2016 Rio Olympics as an automatic berth for the host country of the Olympics. She finished 21st in the all-around at the 2016 Minsk World Cup. On July 1‚Äì3, Gaudio competed at the 2016 Berlin World Cup finishing 17th in the all-around. On August 19‚Äì20, Gaudio competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She finished 23rd in the rhythmic gymnastics individual all-around qualifications and did not advance into the top 10 finals. On August 11‚Äì13, Gaudio competed at the 2017 Kazan World Challenge Cup finishing 30th in the all-around. On August 30 - September 3, Gaudio competed at the 2017 World Championships in Pesaro, Italy; finishing 35th in the all-around qualifications and thus not making the top 24 all- around finalists. In 2018, Gaudio competed at the 2018 Guadalajara World Challenge Cup finishing 31st in the all-around. In 2019, Gaudio competed at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima finishing 3rd in the all around, qualifying for the hoop, clubs and ribbon finals.

Fodder produced by manufacturing is formulated to meet specific animal nutrition requirements for different species of animals at different life stages.  Feed and types of feed  The Washington State Department of Agriculture defines feed as a mix of whole or processed grains, concentrates, and commercial feeds for all species of animals to include customer formula and labeled feeds, and pet feed. These feed are now commercially produced for the livestock, poultry, swine, and fish industries. The commercial production of feed is governed by state and national laws. For example, in Texas, whole or processed grains, concentrates, and commercial feeds with the purpose of feeding wildlife and pets should be duly described in words or animation for distribution by sellers. Most State and Federal codes have clearly stated that commercial feeds should not be adulterated. Animal feeds have been broadly classified as follows: *concentrates: High in energy, contains mainly cereal grains and their byproducts, or is prepared from high-protein oil meals or cakes, and byproducts resulting from sugar beets and sugarcane processing. *roughages: grass pastures, or plant parts like hay, silage, root crops, straw, and stover. Diets given to different species are all not the same. For example, livestock animals are fed on a diet that consists mainly of roughages, while poultry, swine, and fish are fed with concentrates. Livestock in a feedlot may be fed with energy feeds which usually comes from grains, supplied alone or as part of a total mixed ration.  Feed preparation and quality  The quality of the prepared feed ultimately depends on the quality of the material such as the grain or grass used; the raw material should be of very good quality. Commercial feed manufacturing is an industrial process, and therefore should follow HACCP procedures. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines HACCP as ‚Äúa management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of biological, chemical, and physical hazards from raw material production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product‚Äù. The FDA regulates human food and animal feed for poultry, livestock, swine, and fish. Additionally, the FDA regulates pet food, which they estimate feeds over 177 million dogs, cats, and horses in America. Similar to human foods, animal feeds must be unadulterated and wholesome, prepared under good sanitary conditions, and truthfully be labeled to provide the required information to the consumer. Feed formulation for swine Feed makes up approximately 60% to 80% of the total cost of producing hogs. Manufactured feeds are not merely for satiety but also must provide animals the nutrients required for healthy growth. Formulating a swine ration considers the required nutrients at various growth stages in creating an appropriate feed. Three basic methods are used to formulate swine diets: Pearson square, algebraic equations and linear programs (computers). In recent times, microcomputer programs are available that will balance a diet for many nutrients and assist with economic decisions. The basic nutrients required are crude protein, metabolizable energy, minerals, vitamins and water. The formulation procedure has both fixed and variable portions. Swine rations are generally based on a ground cereal grain as a carbohydrate source, soybean meal as a protein source, minerals like calcium and phosphorus are added, and vitamins. The feed can be fortified with byproducts of milk, meat by-products, cereal grains; and \\"specialty products.\\" Antibiotics may also be added to fortify the feed and help the animal‚Äôs health and growth. Distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), which are rich in energy and protein, have been used in place of corn and soybean meal in some livestock and poultry feeds, and corn DDGS have become the most popular, economical, and widely available alternative feed ingredient for use in U.S. swine diets in all phases of production. The U.S. Grain Council reported that corn DDGS is used primarily as an energy source in swine diets because it contains approximately the same amount of digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) as corn, although the ME content may be slightly reduced when feeding reduced-oil DDGS. A 2007 study highlighted the recent trends in the use of DDGS, as many producers are including 20% DDGS in diets of swine in all categories. Although 20% is the recommended level of inclusion, some producers are successfully using greater inclusion rates. Inclusion rate of up to 35% DDGS has been used in diets fed to nursery pigs and finishing pigs. Feed formulation for fish Farmed fish eat specially formulated pellet feeds containing the required nutrients for both fish health and the health of humans who eat fish. A fish feed should be nutritionally well-balanced and provide a good energy source for better growth. Commercially farmed fish are broadly classified into herbivorous fish, which eat mostly plant proteins like soy or corn, vegetable oils, minerals, and vitamins; and carnivorous fish, which are given fish oils and proteins. Carnivorous fish feed contains 30-50% fish meal and oil, but recent research suggests finding alternatives to fish meal in aquaculture diets. Among the various feeds investigated, soybean meal appears to be a better alternative to fishmeal. Soybean meal prepared for the fish industry is heavily dependent on the particle sizes contained in the feed pellets. Particle size influences feed digestibility. The particle sizes of fish pellet feed are influenced by both grain properties and the milling process. Properties of the grain include hardness and moisture content. The milling process affects particle size based on the mill equipment type used, and some properties of the mill equipment (for example corrugations, gap, speed, and energy consumption).  Feed formulation for poultry  As reports have indicated, feeding makes up the major cost in raising poultry animals as birds in general require feeding more than any other animals, particularly due to their faster growth rate and high rate of productivity. Feeding efficiency is reflected on the birds‚Äô performance and their products. According to National Research Council (1994), poultry requires at least 38% components in their feed. The ration of each feed components, although differing for each different stage of birds, must include carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals and vitamins. Carbohydrates, which are usually supplied by grains including corn, wheat, barley, etc. serves as a major energy source in poultry feed. Fats, usually from tallow, lard or vegetable oil are essentially required to provide important fatty acid in poultry feed for membrane integrity and hormone synthesis. Proteins are important to supply the essential amino acids for the development of body tissues like muscles, nerves, cartilage, etc. Meals from soybean, canola, and corn gluten are the major source of plant protein in poultry diets. Supplementation of minerals are often required because grains, which are the main component of commercial feed contain very little amounts of these. Calcium, phosphorus, chlorine, magnesium, potassium and sodium are required in larger amounts by poultry. Vitamins, such as vitamin A, B, C, D, E, and K, on the other hand, are the components that are required in lower amounts by poultry animals. reported that the easiest and most popular way to feed birds is to use pelleted feeds. Aside from the convenience to the farmer, pelleted feeds enable the bird to eat more at a time. In addition, some researchers also found improvement of feed conversion, decreased feed wastage, improved palatability and destruction of pathogens when birds were fed with pellet feed as compared to birds fed with mash feed. Commercial manufacturing of pelleted feed usually involves a series of major processes including grinding, mixing and pelleting. The produced pellets are then tested as to pellet durability index (PDI) to determine quality. To enhance good health and growth, antibiotics are often added to the pelleted feed. Researchers have concluded that smaller particle-sized feed will improve digestion due to the increased surface area for acid and enzyme digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. However, some researchers have recently brought to our attention the necessity of coarse particles for poultry feed to complement the natural design and function of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). and discussed that the GIT retention time decreased due to lack of gizzard function that eventually gave a negative impact on live performance. compared the performance of 21 day old broilers fed with different feed particle size; 0.716 mm and 1.196 mm. They found that the subject fed with larger particle size feed showed better performance. , evaluating different corn particle sizes in the broiler feed found that the largest particle size (2.242 mm) gave better feed intake than the other particle sizes tested (0.781, 0.950, 1.042 and 1.109 mm). , however, argued that the development of broilers was influenced by changing particle sizes. However, variation in particle size between 0.5‚Äì1 mm usually did not have any effect on the broilers. Very fine particles (<0.5 mm) may impair the broilers performance due to the presence of dust that cause respiratory problems, increased water intake, feed presence in the drinkers and increased litter moisture. , in their recent study, concluded that although fine particle sizes (0.27 mm) enhanced broilers live performance, the pelleted feed did not. All of this data shows that both fine and coarse particle sizes do have different functions in poultry feed. Appropriate proportions of these two ingredients must be used with respect to the live performance of the broilers. compared the performance of non-pelleted feed to pellets with fine particles and found that the addition of coarse particles improved feed conversion and body weight. Similar results were also obtained by other researchers like and .  Feed formulation for livestock  Livestock includes beef cattle, dairy cattle, horses, goats, sheep and llamas. There is no specific requirement of feed intake for each livestock because their feed continuously varies based on the animals‚Äô age, sex, breed, environment, etc. However, basic nutrient requirements of a livestock‚Äôs feed must consist of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. Dairy cattle need more energy in their feed than other types of cattle. Studies have shown that energy supplied by feed is provided by various carbohydrate sources, including non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC) such as fermentable feeds or neutral detergent fiber (NDF) such as forage. Feeds with high NDF are good for rumen health, however, they provide less energy and vice versa. Fats are added in the livestock feed to increase energy concentration, especially when the NFC content is already too high since excessive NFC lessens the NDF fraction, affecting the rumen digestion. In ruminants, most proteins consumed are broken down by microorganisms and the microorganisms later get digested by the small intestine. The suggested that the crude protein required in livestock feed should be less than 7%. Lactating ruminants, especially dairy cattle require the highest amount of protein, especially for milk synthesis. Minerals including calcium, phosphorus and selenium are required by livestock for maintaining growth, reproduction and bone health. Like other animals, livestock also require appropriate proportions of fine and coarse particles in their feed. Theoretically, finer particles will be easier to digest in the rumen, however the presence of coarse particles might increase the amount of starch entering the small intestine, thus increasing energetic efficiency. Livestock could be fed by grazing on grasslands, integrated or non-integrated with crop production. Livestock produced in stalls or feedlots are landless and are typically fed by processed feed containing veterinary drugs, growth hormones, feed additives, or nutraceuticals to improve production. Similarly, livestock consume grains as the main feed or as a supplement to the forage based feed. Processing grains for feed is aimed at getting the easiest digestible grains to maximize starch availability, thus increasing the energy supply. reported that milk performance was significantly better when the cattle were fed with ground corn. Aldrich compared the digestibility of various corn particle sizes and distribution and concluded that to have 80% digestibility, a particle size of 0.5 mm should be used (for 16 hr incubation). A research team from the University of Maryland and the USDA studied the development, fermentation in rumen and starch digestion sites in dairy cow feeding on corn grain from different harvests and differently processing, and concluded that digestion, metabolism and heat energy were higher for high moisture corn compared to dry corn. Grinding increased DMI and resulted in increased yields of milk, protein, lactose and non-fat solids.  Feed manufacturing process  Depending on the type of feed, the manufacturing process usually start with the grinding process. Figure 1 illustrates the workflow for general feed manufacturing process. Grinding of selected raw material is to produce particle sizes to be optimally and easily accepted by the animals. Depending on the formulation, feed could contain up to 10 different components including carbohydrate, protein, vitamins, minerals and additives. The feed ration can be pelleted by proportionally homogenizing the specific compositions. Pelleting is achieved by various methods, but the most common means is by extrusion. A hygienic environment is important during the entire process of the feed production to ensure quality feed.  Grain milling for feed preparations  Corn, sorghum, wheat and barley are the most used cereals in the preparation of feed for the livestock, poultry, swine, and fish industry. Roller and hammer mills are the two types of processing equipment generally used to grind grains into smaller particle sizes. Milling cereal grains by mechanical action involves several forces like compression, shearing, crushing, cutting, friction and collision. The particle size of the ground cereal is very important in the animal feed production; smaller particle sizes increase the number of particles and the surface area per unit volume which increase access to digestive enzymes. Other benefits are increased ease of handling and easier mixing of ingredients. The average particle size is given as geometric mean diameter (GMD), expressed in mm or microns (¬µm) and the range of variation is described by geometric standard deviation (GSD), with a larger GSD representing lower uniformity. According to , GMD and GSD are accurate descriptors of particle size distribution when the particle size distribution is expressed as log data, and are distributed log normally. Studies have shown that grinding different grains with the same mill under similar conditions results in products with different particle sizes. The hardness of a grain sample is related to the percentage of fine particles obtained after grinding, with a higher percentage of fine particles from lower hardness grains. discussed that hard endosperm produces irregularly-shaped larger particles, while soft endosperm produces smaller size particles. The correlation between particle size and energy consumed is although not positive but, to obtain very fine particle sizes require higher energy which reduces the rate of production. Moreover, a very fine grind of grain has no impact on the efficiency of pelleting, nor on the power consumed during pelleting. discussed the availability of more data suggesting grain particle sizes are very important in mashed diets than in pelleted diets.

The court held that (1) a bank does not owe any duty of care to the payee of a cheque, so that any loss suffered by the payee as a result of a cheque being incorrectly honoured was not recoverable; and (2) by honouring a forged cheque the bank did not represent that the cheque was valid, and in the absence of any negligence, no estoppel could arise against the bank. Facts An unknown rogue stole a blank cheque in Nigeria from one Commander Robert Bill, who was a retired naval office living in Lagos, and a customer of National Westminster Bank. The rogue (or an accomplice) then met the second defendant, a Mr Ismail. At the relevant time Nigeria operated foreign exchange controls. The official rate pegged the Nigerian pound to the British pound at 1:1, but a black market had grown up whereby people would exchange currency unofficially at around a 30% premium to the official rate.[1975] 1 QB 654 at 663D Mr Ismael wished to get money out of Nigeria, and the rogue claimed to be able to broker a black market trade. Mr Ismael agreed that he would accept a cheque for ¬£8,000 in London and if it cleared, he would then write a cheque to the rogue's order drawn on his bank in Nigeria at the black market rate. Mr Ismael then deposited the cheque with his bankers, Barclays Bank, who were the second defendants, and asked that the cheque be presented for special collection. National Westminster Bank honoured the cheque, being unaware at the time that it had been stolen and forged. Mr Ismael accordingly paid the rogue, who was never heard from again. Once National Westminster Bank became aware of the true state of affairs they sued both Mr Ismael and his bankers, Barclays, for return of the sums. Barclays took no part in the proceedings but agreed to be bound by the court order,[1975] 1 QB 654 at 677BBarclays had nothing to lose; if they were order to repay the sums they would simply debit them from Mr Ismael's account. and Mr Ismael defended the claim.Mr Ismael's counsel was Alexander (Derry) Irvine, later Lord Chancellor. Mr Ismael based his defence on four alternative grounds: (1) that National Westminster Bank had been negligent in failing to spot that the cheque was forged when presented; (2) that the bank had represented that the cheque was good (by paying it) and he had acted to his detriment (by paying the rogue) and so the bank were estopped from subsequently denying the validity of the cheque; (3) that Mr Ismael had changed his position in reliance upon the cheque being paid, and so it would be inequitable to order repayment; and (4) that the bank's negligence should estop them from being entitled to recovery.[1975] 1 QB 654 at 657G-658C Judgment The case came before Kerr J. =Negligence= He first dealt with the allegation of negligence on the part of the paying bank. He noted that the bank had 5,000 customers and 7,000 accounts, and cleared hundreds of items daily. The key allegations of negligence were (i) the signature was forged, and the bank had a legal obligation to know this, (ii) the handwriting for the amounts and dates differed, and (iii) the amount was uncharacteristically large for this customer.[1975] 1 QB 654 at 660E-H The judge dismissed all of these points. Although an individual customer will rarely write a large cheques, banks will often see a customer who writes a large cheque for the first time. Cheques are often signed and then passed to another person to complete. And the saying \\"a bank must know its customer's signature\\" is misleading.\\"The common aphorism that a banker is under a duty to know his customer's signature is in fact incorrect ... The principle is simply that a banker cannot debit his customer's account on the basis of a forged signature, since he has not mandate from the customer for doing so.\\" At [1975] 1 QB 654 at 666G A bank is not entitled to debit its customer's account if the customer has not in fact signed the cheque because there is no mandate, but that is not the same as saying that the bank owes a duty to other parties to recognise a customer's signature. Furthermore, the judge held that the bank did not even owe a duty of care to a payee, and so even if it had been negligent, could not be liable on this basis.\\"I entirely reject this contention. ... a bank owes no duty of care to a payee.\\" At [1975] 1 QB 654 at 662D. =Illegality= The judge noted that Mr Ismael was part of the Lebanese community which was fleeing Nigeria at the time due to instability. He noted that Mr Ismael saw nothing dishonest in his actions of seeking to evade currency restrictions,[1975] 1 QB 654 at 663H and the judge indicated \\"I am satisfied that in his own mind he was at all times acting honestly.\\"[1975] 1 QB 654 at 664A Mr Ismael tried to recover the sums from the rogue in Nigeria but was unable to do so, and counsel for the bank disclaimed any reliance that Mr Ismael's conduct was unlawful.The judge noted (at [1975] 1 QB 654 at 665E) that it would, theoretically, have been open to the bank to argue that a contract to breach the laws of a friendly state is unenforceable on the basis of public policy, see Foster v Driscoll [1929] 1 KB 470 at 519. Although it is not expressly stated within the judgment, the court similarly does not refer to declining equitable relief to Mr Ismael on the basis that he did not have \\"clean hands\\". =Mistake of fact= Kerr J then reviewed the case law relating to recovery of payments for mistake of fact. The case preceded the ground-breaking decision of Robert Goff J in Barclays Bank Ltd v W J Simms, Son and Cooke (Southern) Ltd [1980] 1 QB 677 by some five years, and the judge engaged in a similar struggle, noting \\"the difficulty of extracting any clear principle from the prior authorities\\".[1975] 1 QB 654 at 672E In the end the judge seemed to form the view that the bank had a general right to recover the payment on the basis of mistake of fact. =Estoppel= After reviewing the earlier authorities, the judge held: \\"I do not think that he could in that event treat the payment of the cheque as an unequivocal representation that it was genuine.\\"[1975] 1 QB 654 at 677A Footnotes Category:English banking case law Category:Barclays litigation Category:1974 in case law Category:1974 in British law ","title":"National Westminster Bank v Barclays Bank International Ltd"},{"id":"50409215","text":"Draposa is a genus of wolf spiders in the family Lycosidae, containing ten species.

A usurper or queen is a member of one species, usually female that gives raise to and controls the colony of a particular nest.

Its mission is to develop a public agenda for Massachusetts that promotes the growth and vitality of the middle class. Its governing philosophy is rooted in the ideals embodied in the American Dream: equality of opportunity, personal responsibility, and a strong commonwealth. Their mission is to promote a public agenda for the middle class and to help all citizens achieve the American dream.  Activity  MassINC was founded in 1996 by Tripp Jones and Michael Gritton who, together with a small group of leaders from the civic, business and policy-making fields, believed that the policy process in Massachusetts was missing accurate, thorough and unbiased information and research about the challenges facing the middle class. The organization was built around the conviction that better outcomes would be achieved if policy makers and opinion leaders were armed with credible data and analysis about key issues surrounding quality of life in Massachusetts. Credible, unbiased, fact-based analysis have thus been cornerstones of the MassINC strategy and have made it an organization of record for policy analysis and civic engagement. *The Massachusetts Cape Wind Project took on national prominence as a symbol of the United States' efforts to embrace renewable energy, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and combat climate change. But locally, the project's above-market cost became a hot- button issue, prompting a debate about green industry in general and the best way for Massachusetts to achieve its environmental and energy goals without putting businesses at a competitive disadvantage. In 2010, Greg Torres, President of MassINC and publisher of CommonWealth magazine, Bruce Mohl, editor of CommonWealth and WBUR health and science reporter Sacha Pfeiffer moderated a debate between gubernatorial candidates Charlie Baker and Deval Patrick.  Criminal Justice Reform Coalition  The Massachusetts Criminal Justice Reform Coalition is a group of civic leaders who believe there is an urgent need for comprehensive corrections reform. The Coalition supports law enforcement, county sheriffs, the judiciary, agency officials, and legislative leaders working to advance comprehensive change across the criminal justice system. MassINC provides staffing and organizational support for the Coalition. In 2013, The Massachusetts Criminal Justice Reform Coalition released its first report, Crime, Cost, and Consequences: Is It Time to Get Smart on Crime? The 40-page report outlines the costs of the state's incarceration system and presents reforms to both curb those costs and improve public safety. Among the recommendations are: *Placing a moratorium on state and county prison expansion; *Revisiting the state's approach to sentencing and sanctions; *Expand the use of community supervision and pre-release; and *Review current conditions of confinement, programming, and program quality across the system. Since 2014, MassINC has collaborated with Community Resources for Justice and the Massachusetts Bar Association to host panels and forums on the matter of criminal justice reform. *In 2014, the group hosted a presentation and panel discussion entitled \\"Reform, Re-entry and Results: Change and Progress in the Massachusetts Criminal Justice System.\\" The event featured remarks from Gov. Deval L. Patrick, who announced a program that aims to reduce recidivism by prison inmates by 50 percent during the next five years. The governor called for the reinstatement of the Sentencing Commission, the limited use of restraints on mentally ill inmates in state prisons to only those that pose \\"serious and immediate\\" danger, and the abolishment of the use of restraints on pregnant inmates during labor. He then highlighted the importance of re-entry programs, stating that 97 percent of those incarcerated will return to Massachusetts communities after serving time in prison. He also introduced a \\"step down\\" program in which state prison inmates would be transferred back into society through county correctional facilities before their release. Patrick also stressed the prevention and treatment of substance abuse as primarily a health problem. *The second annual event in 2015 highlighted the state's judicial branch with a focus on state and federal sentencing practices and reforms. In a keynote address, Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph D. Gants called for an end to mandatory minimum sentences in drug cases, noting that mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses are unfair to minority groups, fail to address the drug epidemic and are a poor investment of public funds. The program also included a presentation of new research from Bruce Western, Guggenheim Professor of Criminal Justice Policy at Harvard University, and two panel discussions: \\"High-Performing Sentencing Commissions\\" and \\"Justice for Special Populations.\\" The summit wrapped up with closing remarks from Attorney General Maura Healey. *The theme of the third annual event was the role of cross-agency partnerships within the criminal justice community, focusing on serving individuals with behavioral health conditions, integrating information systems to enable data-driven decision- making and facilitating successful reentry. The keynote speakers were Hampden County Sheriff Michael Ashe and Essex County Sheriff Frank Cousins. Two of the longest serving sheriffs in Massachusetts, Ashe and Cousins each provided their perspectives on effective cross-agency partnerships.  MassINC Polling Group  The MassINC Polling Group is a full-service opinion research company serving public, private, and social sector organizations. The MassINC Polling Group started in Boston with a local and state-level focus and now serves a national client base. Although it has expanded its reach, the group still conducts and releases more public opinion research on Massachusetts than any other polling organization. The president, Steve Koczela, has written extensively on public opinion and data analysis for both media and academic publications. *In 2015, the MassINC Polling Group conducted a poll to gauge Boston area support for hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics. A March 2015 poll indicated that 52% of Boston area residents were opposed to hosting the Olympic Games. On 27 July 2015, the USOC dropped its bid to host the Olympics in Boston citing the lack of public support and uncertainties in the bid. *Throughout 2014, MassINC Polling Group followed the Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2014 and the United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2014 with a series of polls. These polls were extensively cited by publications such as The Huffington Post, Politico, and WBUR-FM. *During the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016 and Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016, MassINC Polling Group conducted surveys to gauge support for each candidate.  Gateway Cities Innovation Institute  In October 2012, MassINC formed the Gateway Cities Innovation Institute to empower local leaders with research, data, leadership development, and technical assistance to make Gateway Cities and their residents stronger contributors to the Commonwealth‚Äôs regional economies. The institute is a think tank that envisions Massachusetts gateway cities (former manufacturing cities) driving regional economies. The Gateway City designation was created in a 2007 MassINC-Brookings Institution report to identify a group of the Massachusetts' traditional manufacturing cities that were missing out on a knowledge-driven economy. In particular, MassINC claims its work benefits Lawrence, New Bedford, Worcester, and Springfield. The Gateway Cities Education Vision Project was the first major initiative of the Gateway Cities Innovation Institute. MassINC has been meeting with Gateway City mayors and superintendents to discuss opportunities to collaborate on education issues since early 2012. These conversations led to consensus that a facilitated process was needed to develop a clear vision for how Gateway Cities could develop cross-sector initiatives to build 21st century education systems that support student success from cradle to career. Through this partnership, the Gateway Cities Innovation Institute will ensure the Gateway Cities education agenda benefits from evidence of best practice and in-depth analysis by researchers.

It was founded in 1988, with headquarters in Romford, London. In October 2018, it employed around 2,000 staff in 23 UK offices. The group offered services in regeneration, compliance, energy services, and construction to the housing, education, public and commercial buildings sectors, with a focus on the UK public sector and regulated markets, before disposing of its property services and construction business in August 2018. This company, Lakehouse Contracts, subsequently went into administration and ceased trading in March 2019, owing ¬£27m to 275 creditors.  History  Steve Rawlings founded Lakehouse in 1988 and remained chief executive until 2014. Lakehouse floated on the London Stock Exchange in March 2015. Ric Piper joined the Lakehouse board in 2016 as chairman. Shortly afterwards, Piper was replaced by Bob Holt, who was appointed as director and executive chairman. Between 2011 and 2015 Lakehouse acquired ten complementary businesses to expand geographically and provide broader services. In 2011 Lakehouse acquired gas compliance services provider K&T; Heating. In 2012 it acquired fire compliance business Allied Protection. Foster Property Maintenance was acquired in 2013. In 2014 it acquired energy services provider Everwarm, who also install electric vehicle charging infrastructure and solar PV systems. and water and air compliance services provider H2O Nationwide. In 2015 it acquired smart metering specialists Providor, energy services broker and energy management service provider Orchard Energy, gas compliance services businesses Sure Maintenance and Aaron Heating, and lift compliance services provider Precision Lifts. In July 2017, Lakehouse confirmed that its fire compliance business, Allied Protection, was engaged by Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in January 2017 to certify installed fire safety systems in Grenfell Tower, destroyed by a large fire on 14 June 2017. Allied was satisfied the system was maintained in accordance with the requirements and all evidence presented to date indicates that it performed as it was designed to do. Allied was however not responsible for the specification of the system. On 1 October 2018, Lakehouse announced it had changed its name to Sureserve plc. In October 2018, ten people were charged as part of a fraud investigation relating to two contracts between Lakehouse and Hackney Homes relating to work in 2013-2014, though there is no suggestion of fraud on Lakehouse's part. =Lakehouse Contracts= Two months earlier, in August 2018, Lakehouse sold its construction and property services operations, Lakehouse Contracts, employing 236 staff, for ¬£500,000 to a newly formed company, Mapps Group Limited. In January 2019, Sureserve announced it had set aside ¬£2.5m for possible claims on projects carried out by the new business and had written off the ¬£500,000 sale price to zero \\"in light of the weak performance of the activities since.\\" In March 2019, Lakehouse Contracts entered administration and ceased trading. Claiming to be owed \\"millions\\", subcontractors affected by the administration planned to attend Sureserve's AGM on 19 March 2019. In April 2019, one subcontractor, Target Structural, said it was seeking ¬£376,000 from Sureserve following an adjudication in its favour relating to a bathroom pod replacement contract in Enfield. In May 2019, it was reported Lakehouse had collapsed owing more than ¬£9 million to hundreds of subcontractors; in August 2019, administrator CMB Partners confirmed 275 creditors were owed more than ¬£27m. In June 2019, Sureserve said it had set aside ¬£5.4m in provisions following the sale and subsequent collapse of the Lakehouse business. The conduct of Lakehouse directors was the subject of a CMB report to the government; investigations continued into the sale of subsidiary Fosters Property Maintenance, sold for ¬£1 despite having a balance sheet value of ¬£3.6m.

Description  It has a height of 205 cm and a width of 200 cm. and shows the wife and eldest daughter of the painter during a walk on the beach in Valencia. The painting is part of the collection of the Museo Sorolla in Madrid.  Analysis  The large canvas is almost square in format and unusually monumental for a beach view.Bego√±a Torres Gonz√°lez: Sorolla, 2009, S. 326 The life-size women depicted are Sorolla's wife Clotilde and his eldest daughter Maria. Sorolla painted the scenery at the Playa de El Cabanyal beach in his hometown of Valencia.Jos√© Luis D√≠ez, Javier Bar√≥n: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 1863-1923, 2009, S. 402. Both women lean forward slightly, so that they appear to move toward the right edge. While the wife stands straight, aligned to the edge, the daughter Maria has slightly turned her head to her right shoulder and is looking towards the viewer. Mother and daughter both wear long white sundresses. The elegant presentation, which also includes a straw hat for each and a parasol for the mother, is typical of the fashion of the time, around 1910. The 19-year-old Maria has a simple floor-length dress that emphasizes her slender silhouette. At the neck the dress is finished with a stand-up collar. The tight-fitting sleeves contrast with the rest of the dress, and are of a more transparent white cloth, through which shines the skin. Of similar fabric is an panel of cloth mounted below the chest on a large ring. The sea wind blows the cloth into arabesques behind the daughter.Jos√© Luis D√≠ez, Javier Bar√≥n: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 1863-1923, 2009, S. 402. Under the dress appears a brown leather shoe; on its side reflections emphasize the smooth surface. In her right hand Maria holds a yellow straw hat with a wide, sweeping brim, decorated with purple colored flowers and a turquoise bow. She has pinned her brown hair into a knot, so that her face comes into its own.Jos√© Luis D√≠ez, Javier Bar√≥n: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 1863-1923, 2009, S. 402. The figure behind the daughter, Clotilde Sorolla, also wears a white dress, her hips accented by a white belt. Thus both the breasts and the buttocks have clearer contours than the daughter's. Clothilde's dress has cropped sleeves, and she carries a jacket, also made of white fabric, on her left forearm in front of her abdomen. In her left hand she holds an open white parasol, which is angled to the ground on the left side. Under Clotilde's dress are two elegant white women's shoes with small heels. On her head Clotilde wears a straw hat, which is also decorated with purple colored flowers. In addition, a greenish-transparent veil is draped over the entire hat, and falls forward over her face and is blown backward almost horizontally in the wind. Clotilde has bent her right arm upward and her hand lies on the veil. This creates the impression that she must adjust it due to the wind veil or even hold it in place. Of the head of Clotilde little can be seen. Large parts of face, depicted in profile, are in shadow and only the chin is in brighter sunlight. Also, the wide sweeping hat obscures the hair almost completely. Just behind a pearl earring is a bit of dark hair. While the young face of the daughter Maria is looks directly into the sun, the face of the mother is hidden by the shadow of the hat. The clothes and accessories show the two women to be members of the upper class spending their free time in the summer with mild temperatures and light winds.Bego√±a Torres Gonz√°lez: Sorolla, 2009, S. 326 Mother and daughter stand a few meters from the sea on an ocher expanse of sand in the foreground at the bottom. Unlike the people depicted, the sand surface is depicted in short strokes. Behind the two women is a seamless transition from the beach to the sea. The perspective of the viewer is slightly raised so that no horizon is visible. Instead, the beach and the sea form a curtain-like background and a curl of white foam rides a wave at the top of the screen, replacing the horizon. The sea shimmers in different shades of blue, which Sorolla applied in elongated brushstrokes.Jos√© Luis D√≠ez, Javier Bar√≥n: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 1863-1923, 2009, S. 402. Before chest of Clotilde the sea has a pale blue color, and behind the backs of the women are rather darker shades of blue. Dimly seen, the area to the right of the daughter, where the turquoise surface of the water is difficult to distinguish from the shore. The dominant color of the image is the white of the dress and the parasol. Sorolla has mixed this white, like the French impressionists, with many other colors. So blue, yellow, lilac or orange shades are in the white form the light and shadow effects.Bego√±a Torres Gonz√°lez: Sorolla, 2009, S. 326 In their bright whites, the figures clearly stand out from the rest of the image. The light is characteristic of the early evening of a summer day in the Mediterranean. The already low sun appears from the direction of the viewer on the two sides to seeing women whose long shadows loom on the beach behind them. Playback of these lighting effects under the southern sun are typical Valenciano for Luminismo, one in Spain resulting from the Impressionism as a special form of Neo-Impressionism, whose main representative was Joaqu√≠n Sorolla.  Background to the creation of the painting  Joaqu√≠n Sorolla: Abendsonne, 1903 La hora del ba√±o, 1904 The 1909 was extremely successful for Sorolla. He had already been widely received recognized for his paintings and received awards not only in Spain but also in France and Germany, but the year 1909 was a high point in his career. On the invitation of the American art collector Archer M. Huntington, he traveled with his wife and the two older children Maria and Joaqu√≠n at the beginning of the year to New York City. Here Huntington had previously opened the Hispanic Society of America that year and in their rooms should Sorolla showed the first exhibition of his work in the United States.Blanca Pons-Sorolla: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 2009, S. 200. It was Sorolla's first trip across the Atlantic and later adjusting success unpredictable. On February 4, 1909, the opening of the exhibition took place;Blanca Pons-Sorolla: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 2009, S. 200. initially only a few visitors came. This changed gradually as very positive reviews appeared in the newspapers. When it closed on March 8 the exhibition had had a total of 169,000 visitors to see Sorolla's work.Blanca Pons-Sorolla: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 2009, S. 202. Encouraged by the overwhelming response, a slightly modified collection was also shown in Buffalo and Boston.Jos√© Luis D√≠ez, Javier Bar√≥n: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 1863-1923, 2009, S. 495. During his stay in the United States Sorolla received 20 portrait commissions, including that of the just-elected US President William Howard Taft, whom he visited in the White House in Washington, D.C.Blanca Pons-Sorolla: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 2009, S. 204. In May 1909, as Sorolla left the United States, he had sold a total of 195 images - including two works to the Metropolitan Museum of Art - and taken in the enormous sum of 181,760 US dollars.Blanca Pons-Sorolla: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 2009, S. 204. Back in Europe, Sorolla held initially in Paris and exhibited in art exhibition of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais, the 1903 painting Evening Sun, an image of fishermen from Valencia.Jos√© Luis D√≠ez, Javier Bar√≥n: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 1863-1923, 2009, S. 495. About Madrid he traveled to Valencia, where he saw his daughter Elena and the rest of the family. He attended the local art exhibition Exposicion Regional and received a second award for the work exhibited there. Inspired by the success of his trip to America and the good reviews he received at the exhibitions in Paris and Valencia, he began a prolific summer. He planned in 1911 to travel again on exhibition tour in the United States and needed new paintings. He stayed until the end of September in Valencia and created in these summer months \\"some of his best and most spectacular beach scenes,\\" as his biographer and granddaughter Blanca Pons-Sorolla notes.Blanca Pons-Sorolla: ‚ÄûSome of his best and most spectacular beach scenes come from this summer‚Äú in Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 2009, S. 204. The resulting paintings of this summer beach walk provide a climax in Sorolla's career according to Jos√© Luis Alcaide.Jos√© Luis Alcaide: ‚ÄûPor supuesto que pintar√° m√°s cuadros de playa, pero sin duda este conjunto de lienzos representa un jalon esencial en su carrera.‚Äú in Jos√© Luis D√≠ez, Javier Bar√≥n: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 1863-1923, 2009, S. 402.  Sorolla's beach paintings  Clotilde en la playa, 1904 Paseo del faro, 1906 Elena en la playa, 1909 Born in Valencia, Joaqu√≠n Sorolla had been familiar since his youth with life on the sea. In his early work, there is the traditional port view Marina, Barcos en el puerto with which he made his debut in the art exhibition Expsoici√≥n National in Madrid in 1881.Blanca Pons-Sorolla: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 2009, S48. In the 1890s he repeatedly returned to the subject of fishermen from Valencia. In some very large paintings he showed fishermen bringing their catch ashore or pulling their boat onto the beach with oxen. He also portrayed boatbuilders or fishwives, not a glamorous life of leisure activities, but working people at sea. For this work he received very positive reviews and was awarded prizes. In addition, these works brought international success. The French government bought the painting La vuelta de la presca from 1895 and the Berlin National Gallery acquired Pescadores Valencianos of 1895. In 1900 Sorolla began to paint children bathing.Zu den fr√ºhesten Arbeiten mit dem Motiv badender Knaben geh√∂rt El ba√±o von 1899, eine Studie zum gro√üformatigen Gem√§lde ¬°Triste herencia! von 1901. In the 1904 painting La hora del ba√±o Sorolla linked fishing and bathing children and portrayed naked children swimming between a fishing boat and an ox standing in the water. In the foreground one of the children comes from the sea and is awaited by a young woman who stretches out a white cloth to dry the wet child. Already this picture anticipates Sorolla's themes in Walk on the Beach. So the white fabric plays a central role: The movement of the cloth in the wind is already the main subject, the shore area between the water and beach has no clear contours and the whole picture is bathed in the light of early evening.Jos√© Luis D√≠ez, Javier Bar√≥n: Joaqu√≠n Sorolla, 1863-1923, 1900, S. 326. That same summer Sorolla portrayed his wife Clotilde at Valencia. In Clotilde en la playa the wife sits on a stool near the sea in a white dress. Here as in the later Walk on the Beach, the parasol is already an important prop. The open parasol casts shadows on her face, which is hidden by a veil in the later image. In this picture the painter has taken a slightly elevated position, so that no background horizon line is visible. Instead of the beach in the foreground it goes directly into the waves of the sea, with no sky to be seen. In 1906, Sorolla and his family visited Biarritz in northern Spain (Note: Biarritz is in France). In the group portrait Paseo de Faro several women walk along the cliffs above the beach. The painter shows here the beach and washed around by underwater rock formation as a background motive. In front of the frieze-like image the women are loosely arranged side by side. Again, white clothing dominates the scene, and only the young girl in the center stands out in a bright red jacket. Large hats and parasols are important props in this image also. In 1909 he returned to the beach in Valencia and again took up themes depicting people at sea. In the portrait Elena en la playa Sorolla portrayed his youngest daughter in a white dress with the beach as a background. In this portrait, from about the same time as Walk on the Beach, Sorolla painted the meeting of land and sea, the waves of the sea, the dress moving in the wind, a hat and the light of a summer day in the Mediterranean.  Provenance  The painting was until the artist's death in his possession. In his will he bequeathed the picture to his son Joaqu√≠n Sorolla Garc√≠a. who was the first director of the museum in the former home of his parents, Sorolla Museum. In 1931 Sorolla's wife Clotilde bequeathed the house together with the inventory to the Spanish government, set up with the support for a Joaqu√≠n Sorolla museum. The son Joaqu√≠n Sorolla Garc√≠a, followed the generous example of his mother and after his death in 1948 bequeathed to the Spanish government the Walk on the Beach painting, along with other works of his father. Since that time, it has belonged to the collection of the Museo Sorolla in Madrid.

It was written by Daran Little, directed by Sophie Lifschutz, and executively produced by Dominic Treadwell-Collins. The episode features the only appearance of the character Alison Slater, played by Denise Welch. The episode focuses on Alison meeting her transgender son Kyle Slater (Riley Carter Millington) for the first time since he transitioned from female to male, though Alison ultimately rejects her son. It also includes a \\"heartbreaking\\" scene between Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) and Dot Branning (June Brown) about the possibility of Sonia having breast cancer, which was praised as \\"fantastic\\" by Inside Soap. The episode received a total viewership of 7,250,000 in the United Kingdom. Plot Kyle Slater (Riley Carter Millington) is happy that his mother Alison Slater (Denise Welch) is visiting him, as he never thought she would want to see him since he transitioned from female to male. Kyle's half-sister Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) has a video chat with her fianc√©, Martin Fowler (James Bye), who sees Andy Flynn (Jack Derges) in the background wearing only a towel; Stacey lies that his boiler has broken (Stacey has actually discovered that Andy is homeless in episode 5273). Kyle leaves before Alison arrives, so Stacey lets her in. Their meeting is a little awkward, as Alison was in a bigamous marriage with Stacey's father, Brian Slater, and he had two families, though neither knew about the other until after Brian's death. Alison insists she thought Brian was single when she met him and found out only four months after he died. Stacey and Alison agree to be civil for Kyle's sake, but when Stacey says Kyle has missed his mother, she says she came to see her daughter, Sarah. Kyle arrives with flowers for Alison, and she says he looks nothing like Sarah. She struggles with the meeting, insisting that she has only daughters and Sarah was beautiful. Kyle says he did not feel beautiful; he felt wrong, but now he does not. Alison says something is wrong with Kyle; he says he was born in the wrong body. Alison refuses to accept it; she had only just came to terms with Sarah being a lesbian when he announced he was transgender. Alison says it is not normal, and Stacey fails to convince her to get to know Kyle, telling her not to take Brian's actions out on Kyle. Alison says she is unable to build a relationship with Kyle, though wishes she could. She wishes him a happy life, but says he is not her Sarah. She takes Kyle's flowers, says she is glad he is not on his own, and leaves. Outside, she cries. Kyle is upset with Stacey for inviting Alison, saying he knew she would not accept him and now any hope he had has gone. Stacey says there will be another chance and apologises. Martin then returns from working away and shows Stacey the cash he has earnt. When she says it does not look like much, he says there is more to come. He then tells Andy to shower somewhere else in future, and Andy says he knows Martin was fired from the job and is lying to Stacey. Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) prepares to visit a doctor after finding a lump in her breast. She is accompanied by her girlfriend Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White), and the doctor refers Sonia for further tests. Back at home, Sonia tells her step-grandmother Dot Branning (June Brown) that she could have cancer and cries in Dot's arms. She admits she is also worried that Tina will no longer love her if she loses her breasts. Dot tells her to be strong and fight it. Sonia then tells Tina that she will have a double mastectomy, regardless of the results. Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) admits to Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford) that the date he had the night before was a scam and he was mugged. She tells him that he is charming and he will find someone genuine. Masood later buys her chocolates but she tells Denise Fox (Diane Parish) in front of Masood that her son Shakil Kazemi (Shaheen Jafargholi) has told her that he overheard her former husband Umar saying he regrets leaving her and wants to reunite.

The episode was written by Daran Little, directed by Sophie Lifschutz, and executively produced by Dominic Treadwell-Collins. Denise Welch was cast as Alison Slater for a one-episode stint. Her casting was announced on 24 March 2016. Welch said of her casting, \\"It's a short stint but such a powerful role and I'm thrilled to be taking it on.\\" Alison is the mother of transgender character Kyle Slater (Riley Carter Millington), though they have not seen each other since Kyle's transition from female to male. An EastEnders source said, \\"Alison is finding it difficult to accept her daughter is now her son and the storyline will follow her meeting Kyle for the first time. It will deal with very sensitive issues.\\" Welsh had previously played the mother of a character who was dating a transgender character in Boy Meets Girl, so was \\"fascinated\\" about the EastEnders role, which she said \\"represents a different attitude\\" to her Boy Meets Girl character. She said she was \\"very proud and honoured to now be part of this storyline in EastEnders\\" and found filming on the Albert Square set \\"bizarre\\" and \\"exciting\\" because she had been watching EastEnders for many years. Welsh said the episode was a \\"wonderful episode, brilliantly written by Daran Little\\" and said that her part in it is \\"a storyline that happens very quickly. This has got a beginning, a middle and an end in this episode\\". Welch's hair was dyed brown for the episode, which Welch said was because she wanted \\"a change\\" and she did not want to wear a wig, and she spent an hour in the make-up department in preparation for filming the episode. Welsh said her scenes are \\"dramatic\\" and \\"upsetting\\", and explained that the reasons for Alison's arrival are because Kyle's half-sister Stacey is \\"a little bit worried about him\\" and \\"can see how much he needs his family so makes the decision to call Alison. Alison hasn't seen Kyle since he transitioned, and she's never met Stacey so this is a massive deal for all of them.\\" She added that the meeting is \\"awkward\\" for everyone involved, due to Kyle's transition and Alison being the woman that Stacey's father was bigamously married to, but explained that \\"Alison is straight to the point and jumps right in and talks to Stacey about it. I think they both know deep down it's neither of their faults, but that doesn't stop the uncomfortableness of it all!\\" Welsh said the meeting is \\"very difficult\\" between Alison and Kyle, as well as \\"very emotional\\" and \\"brief\\". Speaking of Alison's reunion with her estranged son, Welch said, \\"They're still mother and child, and Kyle needs his mum\\" and added, \\"I think he's hopeful Alison will return and open her arms to Kyle but it's just not as simple as that. I don't think Alison really knows what to expect. She knows what's happened and the choices Kyle has made, but when Alison last saw him, he was Sarah. I think she's very nervous about seeing him. This is a big deal for both of them.\\" David Brown from Radio Times said that Kyle \\"will be thrown into a tailspin\\" by Alison's arrival, and that \\"tensions are running high\\" between them. Adam Miller from the Daily Express said that Alison's arrival causes \\"havoc\\" in the show, while Lucia Binding from the International Business Times said Alison's arrival would be \\"controversial\\" and Deepika Rajani from OK! said that the reunion between Alison and Kyle would not be a \\"heartwarming\\" one. Inside Soap said Alison's arrival was \\"set to cause fireworks\\" and Danny Walker from the Daily Mirror said that Kyle's past \\"will come back to haunt him\\" with Alison's arrival. Welsh appeared on This Morning to promote the episode. The scenes involving Sonia, Tina and Dot are part of a wider storyline in which Sonia discovers she is carrying a mutated BRCA2 gene, inherited from her mother, Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson), putting her at a higher risk of breast cancer, and follow on from scenes in the previous episode where Sonia discovers Tina has cheated on her with Kyle's friend, Sophie Dodd (Poppy Rush). An EastEnders source said, \\"Tina is being amazing [in supporting Sonia], but Sonia needs another shoulder to cry on.\\" Of the scenes between Sonia and Dot, the source said, \\"Together they talk about how worried [Sonia] is, and how she fears this anxiety will never end. Even if the lump isn't cancer, she's still carrying the BRCA2 gene and could get it at any time. The fear is overwhelming and Sonia doesn't know how to cope with it. She's got some major decisions to make.\\" Carl Greenwood from the Daily Mirror said that \\"Although [Carol] beat the disease, Sonia is understandably at her wits' end with worry about her own fate and turns to Dot Branning (June Brown) to help her through it.\\" Molly Rose Pike from the Daily Star said that \\"Dot is the only one there for Sonia\\". On Carmel's scenes in the episode, Kate White from Inside Soap reported that Carmel has a \\"big shock\\" when Shakil tells her that her former husband wants her back, as Carmel has \\"spent a long time coming to terms with Umar's decision to leave her for another woman, and the pain of their separation remains hard to bear\\", and said that \\"Carmel is stunned to hear of his romantic intentions.\\" An EastEnders source said that Carmel \\"found it hard to let him go, even as Umar didn't seem to give her a second thought.\\" The scenes in this episode set up scenes for the following episode where Carmel prepares to meet Umar. Although Shakil does not appear in this episode, the scenes also lead to his introduction in the following episode, which reveals that Shakil has lied in this episode. On Carmel's relationship with Masood, White said that Carmel is \\"smarting over seeing former lover Masood enjoying a date with another woman at the pub\\" because \\"there was a time when Carmel believed Masood could be her future\\". On Martin and Andy's scenes, Inside Soap reported that Martin's firing is \\"a bitter blow\\" as he has \\"been struggling to make the rent\\" and has \\"added pressure of his upcoming wedding\\". They said that Stacey does not realise Martin has lost his job \\"mainly because he's still bringing some money to the table\\". Andy works out that Martin has lost his job in the episode, and the scenes are a lead-up to the following episodes, where Andy tells Stacey that Martin has lost his job and Martin confesses to Stacey when she confronts him. Reception After seven days of the episode being shown on BBC One, it had been watched by 7.04million people, including streaming through BBC iPlayer, and after 28 days, the number had risen to 7.147million. It was the second most-watched TV episode of the week, after Britain's Got Talent on ITV. A same-day repeat of the episode on W was watched by 100,000 people within seven days and 103,000 people within 28 days. This gave the episode a total viewership of 7.25million. Ultimately, it was the 71st most watched episode of EastEnders in 2016, out of 210 episodes. Digital Spy polled its readers on what they thought would be the best soap storyline in the upcoming week of 2 May 2016 out of a choice of five. Welch's guest appearance as Alison was voted first with 37%, compared to storylines from Hollyoaks (29%), Emmerdale (18%), Coronation Street (11%) and Doctors (5%). Welch's performance in the episode was praised by viewers on social media, with viewers' comments including, \\"This storyline is brill[iant]. Opens up so much for transgender men & women\\" and \\"Great episode tonight, those scenes between Kyle and his mum where heartbreaking\\" and some viewers calling for Welsh to be given a more permanent role in the show following what some viewers called a \\"flawless\\" and \\"powerful\\" performance. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said the scenes of Alison rejecting Kyle were \\"heartbreaking\\" and \\"tear-jerking\\", and \\"packed a real emotional punch\\". Neela Debnath from the Daily Express opined that Alison is \\"transphobic\\" in the episode. Ian Sandwell from Digital Spy said the scene where Sonia confides in Dot is \\"heartbreaking\\", while Inside Soap called it a \\"fantastic scene\\", adding that \\"Natalie Cassidy and June Brown are just brilliant together.\\" Laura-Jayne Tyler from the same publication praised Welch's performance, writing \\"This wasn't just your run- of-the-mill EastEnders guest appearance. Denise Welch really earned her fee.

Personal life  Freund-Rosenthal was born in Brooklyn on January 1, 1906, and reared in Harlem and Perth Amboy, New Jersey. The child of Harry Kottler and Rebecca Zindler, a member of the first Zionist women‚Äôs group on the East Side, the Daughters of Zion. She earned her bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1925, and went on to earn a master's degree and doctorate in American history from New York University in 1935, where she joined the sorority Alpha Epsilon Phi. In 1927, she married Milton B. Freund, with whom she had two sons, Matthew and Harry, before his death of a heart attack in 1968. She remarried to Harry Rosenthal, an importer of men's sportswear, in 1974, and thereafter moved to his Saint Paul, Minnesota home. In 1998, Freund-Rosenthal died in Miami Beach at the age of 92.  Career  Freund-Rosenthal taught in the New York City Public Schools for 15 years until 1944. She also played a major role in raising the funds to found Brandeis University in 1948. = Hadassah = Throughout the latter half of 1930s, after her first trip to Israel, Freund-Rosenthal was asked to speak to Hadassah groups about her visit. In 1940, she was asked to join the national board of Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America. She left Hadassah in 1942 before resigning from her position as a public school teacher and returning to Hadassah in 1943, when she took over as the chair of the American Zionist Youth Commission. Between 1943 and 1956 she held a variety of Hadassah National Board positions including National Vocational Education chair, National Youth Aliyah chair, and Vice President. From left to right: Moshe Sharett, Miriam Freund, Louis Lipsky, and Nahum Goldmann, 1960 In 1956, Freund-Rosenthal was elected national president of Hadassah. During her four- year tenure, Hadassah built and dedicated its new medical center at Ein Karem in Jerusalem. At the time, the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank made the Hospital's original campus on Mount Scopus unusable and the hospital had been operating in a scattered set of temporary facilities. Freund-Rosenthal persuaded Marc Chagall to design and execute the twelve stained-glass windows symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel for the medical center's synagogue, which have come to be known as the \\"Chagall windows.\\" After her presidency, she held other board posts including the chair of Education, Zionist Affairs, Hadassah Magazine (from 1966 to 1971), two Youth Survey committees, and nongovernmental representative to the United Nations. = Post-Hadassah = Freund-Rosenthal continued her scholarly pursuits outside Hadassah. She was a founding member of the World Bible Society. She delivered a paper, \\"Medicine and the Hebraic Tradition,\\" at the 25th International Congress of Orientalists. After moving to Saint Paul with her second husband, she helped create an educational endowment fund for National Hadassah. And in her late eighties, she spearheaded the compilation and editing of A Tapestry of Hadassah Memories, a collection of interviews and memoirs of Hadassah leaders. In 1991, she was elected an American regent of the International Center for University Teaching of Jewish Civilization.  Books  *Jewish Merchants in Colonial America (1939).Morris, Richard B.. 1941.

Andante - part two of planned four-painting cycle ≈Ωvaig≈æd≈æi≈≥ sonata SONATA VI are two paintings, Stellar sonata. Allegro and Stellar sonata. Andante, of Mikalojus Konstantinas ƒåiurlionis from 1908.  The artist  ƒåiurlionis was a Lithuanian composer and painter. His most famous musical compositions are probably the symphonic poems. In the Forest (Mi≈°ke) and The Sea (J≈´ra). They are both in a late romantic idiom. As a painter ƒåiurlionis was a symbolist rooted in Lithuanian mythology, and his paintings were built in part by musical form principles.  \\"Musical\\" paintings  ƒåiurlionis painted seven pictorial sonatas. He originally numbered them (the titles were later adapted). His pictorial sonatas can be connected with synaesthesia, the fusion of music and art, and embody an original approach to syn√¶stesis. The artist uses principles of musical composition in the paintings associated with the structure of musical forms such as sonatas, fugues or preludes. He united motifs from reality, spatial levels, dates and contrasting symbolic images into a single compositional system or cycle, based on the dynamics of rhythm. Stellar Sonata. Allegro is a vision of outer space with fantastic multi- layered images. The compositional elements of the painting are arranged in a complex varying rhythm. To portray the third dimension he did not use perspective, but instead overlays of varying opacity. ƒåiurlionis imagines the universe as a grand polyphonic symphony, junctions of cosmic nebulae, stars and sunlight. The waves of this space ocean - the songs - mix together to form a rich, ornamented and beautiful network pierced by the path of the Milky Way. The movement in outer space is not chaotic, but rhythmic and harmonic. The symbol of order and harmony in the universe is an angel-like, a figure of light standing on a tapered tower of light. The second part of the sonata ( \\"Stellar sonata. Andante\\") is also solemn and monumental, but much more restrained: a few bands of cosmic fog blur one spherical planet, perhaps the Earth itself, and an angel goes slowly over the band of the Milky Way, and gives the impression of serene and magnificent music. This is one of the artist's most musical creations, full of the interplay of colors, rhythmic variations and a powerful imagination.Sonata No. 6 (Sonata of the Stars). Allegro.

The SSO consists of four Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien telescopes of 1-metre primary aperture, made by ASTELCO. Each telescope is equipped with a NTM-1000 robotic mount and will search for Earth-sized exoplanets around 1000 ultra-cool stars and brown dwarfs. As of June 2019, the SNO consists of one telescope, but more might be added in the future with up to three telescopes for SNO. SPECULOOS is complemented by SAINT-EX and TRAPPIST.  Science overview  Ultra-cool dwarf stars and brown dwarfs have a small radius, causing the transits caused by planets to be deeper. This allows the detection of terrestrial planets around these dwarfs, which are predicted to be common around brown dwarfs. The TRAPPIST-1 system showed that ultra-cool dwarfs form terrestrial planets in the habitable zone. For brown dwarfs it was predicted that 175 of these objects need to be monitored to find one system with transiting planets. During the survey operation each telescope will observe one target for about 10 nights. This kind of observation is optimized for each target to find exoplanets in the habitable zone. To observe 500 targets in the southern hemisphere 1200 nights or 5 years are needed. The continuous observation of one target is needed to find these exoplanets in the habitable zone around ultra-cool dwarf stars. Such planets are expected to have a short transit duration, which can be small as 15 minutes.  Individual telescopes and first light  First light image of the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory‚Äôs Callisto telescope, showing the Horsehead Nebula. The system of SPECULOOS - South (SSO) comprises four telescopes called Europa, Io, Callisto, and Ganymede. The telescopes are named after the Galilean moons that orbit the planet Jupiter, the most massive planet in the solar system. The first telescope (Europa) saw its first light in April 2017.Europa First light!. SPECULOOS. 20/04/2017 The second telescope (Io) began operations in October 2017.Io, Europa‚Äôs young brother is installed. SPECULOOS. 04/10/2017 As of December 2019, all SPECULOOS - South telescopes are operational. ESO released first light images of SPECULOOS - South on the 2018-12-05. The telescopes did take images of the Carina Nebula, the Horsehead Nebula and the spiral galaxy Messier 83. Artemis is the first telescope for SPECULOOS - North (SNO) it began operations on June 20, 2019. The robotic observations of each of the four telescopes is controlled by the program ACP Expert. Each telescope is equipped with an Andor Peltier-cooled deeply depleted 2k √ó 2k CCD camera and the telescopes have a 12 √ó 12 arcminutes field of view. Wavelength The four 1 m-diameter telescopes will be equipped with cameras sensitive in the near-infrared, the wavelength range in which ultra-cool stars and brown dwarfs emit most of their light. The detectors are optimized for 700 to 1000 Œºm wavelength, to observe ultracool dwarfs with a J-band magnitude of 14 or brighter at good seeing conditions. Collaboration SPECULOOS involves scientists from the University of Li√®ge (Belgium), the University of Birmingham (UK), the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge (UK), the University of Bern (Swiss), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias and the King Abdulaziz University (Saudi Arabia), under the leadership of Micha√´l Gillon of the University of Li√®ge. The European Southern Observatory (ESO) supports and hosts the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory (SSO) at the Paranal Observatory. Name As with the other space observation projects of the University of Li√®ge like TRAPPIST, the name Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars makes up a backronym referring to the traditional Belgian spiced biscuit known as Speculoos.

Facts Sir Harry Foster, a British politician, entered into contracts with various parties (including a distiller and a ship broker) to finance an undertaking for the supply of 500 cases of whisky into the United States in breach of prohibition laws. In pursuance of the undertaking bills of exchange were presented for payment but dishonoured. Foster then sought rescission of the contract. Three actions were consolidated and eventually came before the Court of Appeal. Decision The judge at first instance, Wright J, held that the purpose of the enterprise was to smuggle whisky into the United States for profit. Although this was not illegal in England, it was clearly in breach of US laws, and thus he declined to enforce the contracts. In the Court of Appeal Lawrence LJ held \\"I am clearly of opinion that a partnership formed for the main purpose of deriving profit from the commission of a criminal offence in a foreign and friendly country is illegal\\". Accordingly the court dismissed all of the claims and counterclaims, without any order as to costs. Authority The case is still cited as good authority for the proposition that a contract to break the laws of a friendly foreign jurisdiction will be unenforceable for illegality even if the contract is otherwise lawful under English law.

However, many Native Hawaiians and Hawaii-born Americans (mainly descendants of the American missionaries), abroad and in the islands, enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the Union and the Confederacy. Governmental policy Kamehameha IV declared Hawaii's neutrality in 1861. After the outbreak of the American Civil War, Hawaii was concerned with the possibility of attacks by Confederate privateers in the Pacific. There were debates in the Hawaiian government in regards to the best course of action. Minister of Foreign Affairs Robert Crichton Wyllie advocated for a declaration of neutrality, following the one made by the previous king Kamehameha III during the Crimean War in 1854, while King Kamehameha IV and Minister of Finance David L. Gregg feared the diplomatic repercussions of recognizing the belligerent status of the Confederate States of America and were initially reluctant to risk displeasing the United States with any form of recognition of the Confederacy. After the United Kingdom and France declared their neutrality in the conflict, the King, and Gregg relented. On August 26, 1861, King Kamehameha IV signed the formal proclamation of neutrality: > Be it known to all whom it may concern, that we, Kamehameha IV, King of the > Hawaiian Islands, having been officially notified that hostilities are now > unhappily pending between the government of the United States and certain > States thereof styling themselves \\"The Confederate States of America,\\" > hereby proclaim our neutrality between said contending parties.

And be it further known that we > hereby strictly prohibit all our subjects, and all who reside or may be > within our jurisdiction, from engaging, either directly or indirectly, in > privateering against the shipping or commerce of either of the contending > parties, or of rendering any aid to such enterprises whatever; and all > persons so offending will he liable to the penalties imposed by the laws of > nations, as well as by the laws of said States, and they will in no wise > obtain any protection from us as against any penal consequences which they > may incur. Be it further known that no adjudication of prizes will be > entertained within our jurisdiction, nor will the sale of goods or other > property belonging to prizes be allowed. Be it further known that the rights > of asylum are not extended to the privateers or their prizes of either of > the contending parties, excepting only in cases of distress or of compulsory > delay by stress of weather or dangers, of the sea, or in such cases as may > be regulated by treaty stipulation. Given at our marine residence of Kailua > this 26th day of August, A. D. 1861, and the seventh of our reign. A few months before the neutrality proclamation, an American expatriate and businessman, Captain Thomas Spencer, personally funded and drilled a company of infantry composed mostly of Native Hawaiians from Hilo on the island of Hawaii. They were sworn in at a Fourth of July luau hosted by Spencer at his residence in Hilo. These volunteers, dubbed the \\"Spencer's Invincibles,\\" offered their services to President Lincoln and the Union. However, to avert diplomatic controversy and in defense of the Hawaii's neutrality, King Kamehameha IV and Foreign Minister Wyllie officially denied permission for the men to go as a unit. When Captain Spencer heard the news, he reportedly burst into tears. Hawaiian combatants Despite the Hawaiian government's reluctance to be involved in the conflict, many Native Hawaiians and Hawaii- born Americans (mainly descendants of the American missionaries) both abroad and in the islands volunteered and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the Union and the Confederacy. Individual Native Hawaiians had been serving in the United States Navy and Army since the War of 1812, and even more served during the American Civil War. Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaii's ties to New England through its missionaries and the whaling industries, and the ideological opposition of many to the institution of slavery, which the Constitution of 1852 had specifically officially outlawed in the Kingdom. The sons of American missionaries in Hawaii, many studying in American universities, also enlisted; twenty-one were students at Punahou School. Notable volunteers from Hawaii include: Henry Ho ªolulu Pitman, Samuel C. Armstrong, Nathaniel Bright Emerson, James Wood Bush, Prince Romerson, and J. R. Kealoha.

The exact number still remains unclear because many Hawaiians enlisted and served under Anglicized names and little is known about them due to the lack of detailed records. Legacy Memorial plaque for Hawaii Sons of the Civil War in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, Honolulu Many veterans of the Civil War are buried in Honolulu's O ªahu Cemetery, although most of the marked graves belong to veterans from other states who later settled in Hawaii. On August 26, 2010, on the anniversary of the signing of the Hawaiian Neutrality Proclamation, a bronze plaque was erected along the memorial pathway at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu recognizing the \\"Hawaii Sons of the Civil War\\", the more than one hundred documented Hawaiians who served during the American Civil War for both the Union and the Confederacy. In 2013, Todd Ocvirk, Nanette Napoleon, Justin Vance, Anita Manning and others began the process of creating a historical documentary about the individual experiences and stories of Hawaii-born soldiers and sailors of the American Civil War from both the Union and the Confederacy. In 2015, the sesquicentennial of the end of the war, the National Park Service released a publication titled Asians and Pacific Islanders and the Civil War about the service of the large number of combatants of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who fought during the war.

Between 1925 and 1951 she was a teacher of religious education, assistant registrar, secretary to the president, and the registrar.

We are taken to the living moment as it passes.‚Äù Major Jackson: ‚Äú...an eclectic imagination that redeems the conventional exploits of language and all the dead zones around us...consecrates Statman‚Äôs forever voice.‚Äù Aliki Barnstone calls him ‚Äúa consummate poet-translator.‚Äù In noting the influence of Williams, Pound, and Creeley, the critic Eileen Murphy wrote, of Exile Home, \\"The book has the almost-hypnotic effect of one big, sprawling poem--reminding me of Whitman's Leaves of Grass or Ginsberg's \\"Howl.\\" With the publication of Poet in New York in 2008 and the appearance of Tourist at a Miracle in 2010, Statman, who had primarily read his poetry and talked about his work as a teacher of creative writing in the New York City and tri-state area and at academic and professional meetings, began appearing at national and international venues. He has continued to read with the subsequent publications of poetry books and poetry in translation. Among the more prominent sites are the Times Cheltenham Festival (UK), the Miami Book Fair International, US Poets in Mexico, and the Mundial Po√©tico de Montevideo (UY). Statman is married to painter and writer Katherine Koch, the daughter of poet Kenneth Koch. His son is New York anti-folk musician Cannonball Statman. In September 2016, Statman retired from teaching to devote himself full-time to writing. He lives in San Pedro Ixtlahuaca and Oaxaca de Ju√°rez, Oaxaca, Mexico.

The vocation still stands today.  Background  Mary was born as the eldest daughter of five children, of Sir Christopher Wandesford, 1st Baronet Wandesford of Kirklington, and his wife Eleanor Lowther, the daughter of Sir John Lowther of Lowther Hall. They derived most of their wealth from coal mines in their Estate at Castlecomer in Ireland. Mary's brother, George Wandesford, was made Viscount Castlecomer in 1707. She was baptized in the church at Kirklington on 23 June 1655.http://genealogy.links.org/links- cgi/readged?/home/ben/camilla-genealogy/current+c-wandesford29900+2-2-0-1-0 To pursue her religion, Mary Wandesford moved from her family's estate in rural Yorkshire to the city of York. There, she rented lodgings in a cathedral close and associated herself with the religious sphere. This included her expenditures in service to the church. One offering still notable today are the black gilded iron gates of the York cathedral.Halfpenny, Joseph. Gothic Ornaments in the Cathedral Church of York: Drawn and Etched by Joseph Halfpenny. York: Geo. Peacock, printer, 1800. Plate 64  Wandesford House  She is known for the Wandesford House, a charity. Wandesford had never married and in her will, dated 4 November 1725, left funds for the creation of a \\"religious house of Protestant retirement\\" in York for ten poor unmarried woman, thereby creating a religious community for single women. It was the norm during the time, though not a law, that siblings inherited. However, as a single woman, Wandesford exercised her freedom in her will. It was also notable because of the lack of religious vocationals available, especially for Anglican women, a circumstance she tried to change by her own means through her will. She bequeathed sizeable properties in Brompton on Swale, with a mortgage worth up to ¬£1,200 and an additional ¬£1,200 in South Sea Company Stocks and annuities, profits of which were not only used for the endowment of the institution, but also to pay for a schoolmaster to teach poor children at Kirklington. It was also her wish that at her funeral, \\"six of the poorest unmarried women in Kirklington may have white vales from head to foot prepared for them and white gloves, and carry [her] corps into the church...Let the white vales be such cloth as will do them service hereafter.\\" To oversee this project, Wandesford named four trustees in her will, that of archbishop of York, two canons at the Minster, her nephew John Wandesford, and rector of Kirklington. By involving powerful clergymen into her scheme, she acquired their blessings and protection needed to help make this building possible. Her family was less than fond of this idea, and her nephew, then a minor, contested the will in 1726, in the Court of Chancery by the Duke of Newcastle. In 1737, a full decade after Mary's death, the court upheld her will, but not until they ordered that women over fifty may inhabit the house.

S. Fly. She ran the studio solo for a decade after his death. There were very few women photographers in this period, and her contributions were recognized in 1989 when she was inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame. Personal life Mary Edith McKie, known as Mollie, was born in 1847 and moved to San Francisco with her family in the late 1850s. Little else is known about her early life, and nothing is known about how she got her photographic training. She married twice, first to a man named Samuel D. Goodrich whom she divorced after two years. In 1879, she married photographer Camillus Sidney \\"Buck\\" Fly in San Francisco; they later adopted a daughter, Kitty. Photographic career The Flys moved to the boom town of Tombstone in Arizona Territory in 1879 and set up a photographic studio. Initially it was housed in a tent, but by mid 1880 they had built a 12-room boarding house at 312 Fremont St., with their Fly's Photography Gallery housed in the back part of the premises. In 1881, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral took place in a lot next to the boarding house, and Ike Clanton escaped through the boarding house during the fight. Fly's Photography Gallery (before 1912). A modern reconstruction exists today in Tombstone. Photographic postcard by Mollie Fly, captioned \\"Arizona Prospectors, Tombstone\\", n.d. (before 1912). A rare example of her work. Buck was often gone on photographic expeditions, and during his absence Fly ran both the boarding house and Fly's Photography Gallery, taking studio portraits for 35 cents apiece. It is not known how many photographs she took because almost all the known images from Fly's Photography Gallery are credited to her husband. There are a couple of extant postcards of street scenes credited to her. Buck became a heavy drinker, and Fly separated from him for a time in 1887. By the late 1880s, Tombstone was suffering from a declining economy, so in 1893, the Flys moved to Phoenix, Arizona and opened a new photography studio. This business failed and they returned to Tombstone a year later. The Flys separated again in the late 1890s, at which time Buck opened a studio in the copper-mining town of Bisbee, Arizona. Here the Flys suffered the first of two fires that would destroy a large portion of their collection of glass- plate negatives; in this case, the negatives lost were in storage at the Phelps Dodge Mercantile Company warehouse. While Buck was in Bisbee, Fly ran the Tombstone studio on her own, continuing to do so for another decade after Buck's death in Bisbee in 1901. In 1905, she published a collection of Buck's photographs entitled Scenes in Geronimo‚Äôs Camp: The Apache Outlaw and Murderer. The Fly photography studio burning in July 1915.

John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible. Exposition of the Old and New Testament. Published in 1746-1763. Verse 16 : For the Lord, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: :: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the Lord of hosts: : therefore take heed to your spirit, :: that ye deal not treacherously. * \\"He hateth putting away\\": This is another reason against divorce: God hates it. It is contrary to his original institution, and was only allowed for the hardness of men's hearts (see Deuteronomy 24:1, etc.; Matthew 19:3-9). Septuagint, \\"If thou hate her and dismiss her,\\" etc.; Vulgate, \\"If thou hate her, put her away,\\" which seems to encourage divorce, whereas in the context divorce is strongly condemned. Hence Jerome considers these words to be spoken by the Jews, quoting in their defence Moses' precept. Others think that they are ironical - Put her away, if you please; but you must bear the consequences.Joseph S. Exell; Henry Donald Maurice Spence-Jones (Editors). The Pulpit Commentary. 23 volumes. First publication: 1890. * \\"One covereth violence with his garment\\": or, \\"and violence covereth his garment,\\" or, it might be, in the same sense, \\"he covereth his garment with violence\\" , so that it cannot be hid, nor washed away, nor removed, but envelopes him and his garment; and that, to his shame and punishment. It was, as it were, \\"an outer garment of violence\\", as Asaph says in Psalm 73:6, \\"violence covereth them as a garment;\\" or David in Psalm 109:18, \\"he clothed himself with cursing as with a garment.\\" It was like a garment with \\"fretting leprosy,\\" unclean and making unclean, to be burned with fire. Leviticus 13:47-58. Contrariwise, the redeemed saints had Revelation 7:14 \\"washed their robes and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb.\\" Having declared God's hatred of this their doing, he sums up in the same words, but more briefly; \\"and this being so, ye shall take heed to your spirit, and not deal treacherously.\\"Barnes, Albert. Notes on the Old Testament. London, Blackie & Son, 1884. Reprint, Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1998. Maurer translates, \\"And (Jehovah hateth him who) covereth his garment (that is, his wife, in Arabic idiom; compare Genesis 20:16, 'He is to thee a covering of thy eyes'; the husband was so to the wife, and the wife to the husband; also Deuteronomy 22:30; Ruth 3:9; Ezekiel 16:8) with injury.\\" The Hebrew favors \\"garment,\\" being accusative of the thing covered (as in Psalm 73:6). Their \\"violence\\" is the putting away of their wives; the \\"garment\\" with which they try to cover it is the plea of Moses' permission (Deuteronomy 24:1; compare Matthew 19:6-9).Robert Jamieson, Andrew Robert Fausset; David Brown.

Brier was born in River Falls, Wisconsin. When he was six, the family moved to Everett, Washington, in order to be in a healthier climate for his sick father. Brier was educated at the University of Washington, and did graduate work at the University of California. He worked as a reporter and later in the advertising department of several newspapers in Seattle. Following that, he became a high school English teacher and later vice-principal of Garfield High School in Seattle. Brier later joined the faculty of the University of Washington as a professor of journalism. He was awarded a Gold Key by the Columbia Scholastic Press Association in 1954, for service to student journalism at the university. Columbia Scholastic Press Association Gold Key Recipients, 1954 Brier's set many of his plots in the Pacific Northwest, where he lived. He wrote in a direct style, depending more on action than on description to make his characters come alive. Because he always held a full-time non-writing job, Brier often serialized his stories in magazines, such as Boys' Life, and then later collected the installments and published them in book form. As a journalism professor and consultant, Brier had definite views on what makes good writing: :\\"Very few of us will ever do anything of literary merit. Good sound craftsmanship, is what we need. How do we become sound craftsmen? (i) write to sell; (ii) write for interest‚Äî keep your reader always in mind; (iii) write briefly, clearly and concisely. The beginning writer's most popular fault is redundancy. When writing for the general public, keep it simple.\\" The BC Teacher, Nov. 1953, p. 69 Brier married Grace Kjelstad in 1930.

Echorsis: Hair-pulling Between Good and Evil) or simply Echorsis is a 2016 Philippine supernatural spoof horror film directed by Lemuel Lorca and produced by Chris Cahilig of Insight 360, and stars John Lapus, Kean Cipriano, and Alex Medina. It premiered in cinemas on April 13, 2016. Synopsis The film revolves around a gigolo Carlo (Alex Medina), who was possessed by a gay entity after he deceived Kristoff (John Lapus) his closeted gay lover. Father Nick (Kean Cipriano) is then tasked to exorcise the spirit out of Carlo's body. Cast =Main cast= *John Lapus as Kristoff *Alex Medina as Carlo *Kean Cipriano as Father Nick =Supporting cast= *Ruby Ruiz as Nanay San *Chokoleit‚Ä† as The Devil Gay *Menggie Cobarrubias as Kristoff's father, a military man *Odette Khan as Kristoff's mother, a devout Catholic *Bekimon as Cheng, Kristoff's best friend *Nico Antonio as Menchu, Kristoff's best friend *Francine Garcia as Vida, Kristoff's best friend *Yuki Sakamoto as Mark, Carlo's bestfriend *Anjo Resurreccion as The Devil With Abs *Mich Liggayu as Mariel, Carlo's materialistic girlfriend *Alessandra de Rossi as Girl Vatuh *Kiray Celis as the possessed girl *Toni Co as parish secretary Marlon *Rob Sy as Tyo Pablo, Nanay Sula's lover *Raymond Rinoza as Father Silva *Ces Aldaba as Father Mar Production The film was directed by Lemuel Lorca and was produced by Chris Cahilig under the production firm, Insight 360. Jerry Gracio served as writer of the film. Echorsis was described as a parody of The Exorcist. The concept for Echorsis was created in 2011, when director Lorca and writer Gracio were discussing of a concept for a film in 2011. They were laughing about the concept which revolves around someone being possessed by a gay demon. In 2012 the two became serious about the concept and a script based on it was completed by late 2015. One of the challenges to producing the film was finding a producer to finance the film. The script was sent to Chris Cahilig, a PR specialist who stepped in with financing. Producer Cahilig described the film as an \\"out-of-the-box\\" comedy. On the second day since the film's premiere in cinemas, Cahilig remarked that \\"Filipino moviegoers are ready for a black comedy such as Echorsis.\\" He also remarked that the box office success of local films, English Only, Please, Heneral Luna, and That Thing Called Tadhana motivated the production team to continue on doing the Echorsis project despite the film's unconventional plot. Echorsis is Lorca's sixth film and the biggest in terms of budget and was described by the director as a slight \\"mainstream commercial\\". The \\"light\\" film was a contrast to Lorca's previous indie films which had a more serious mood. =Casting= Alex Medina plays as the character Carlo, a conman who victimizes gays. He gets possessed by different gay spirits of those he previously preyed on. According to Medina he was the last person who auditioned for the role. He said that he accepted the role saying that the film is \\"not a typical gay story\\" and that Echorsis tackles love and said it's about \\"acceptance\\" and tackles many different issues. Medina commenting on his role as Carlo, a straight man who gets possessed by gay spirits, was challenging which he remarked as physically exhausting since the role demanded him to be flamboyant in selected scenes. He also felt uncomfortable with the bed scenes but remarked that he trusts his colleague Lapus and that he has been friends with Cipriano. Medina also expresses openness in doing other gay roles in future projects. Release =Marketing= The trailer for the film was released online in early February 2016. The trailer garnered close to a million views by February 22, 2016. By April 15, 2016, the views garnered by the trailer counted almost 4 million. =Theatrical release= Echorsis was released in cinemas nationwide in the Philippines on April 13, 2016, a week ahead as originally planned. The film was previously planned to be screened on April 20 but the opening date was moved to an earlier date due to public demand following the release of the film's trailer. The film was rated R13 by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board. According to Medina, the film received low turnout on its opening day similar to what Heneral Luna which was momentarily removed from cinema line-up due to poor ticket sales on the first day. He expressed concern that Echorsis might risk being removed from cinema line-ups as well. However Lapus expressed optimism that the film will be patronized in the coming days especially the Filipino LGBT community due to positive comments on the movie trailer. Medina also said that the film's social media campaign was successful. Echorsis was given a second week in cinemas and was screening in eight cinemas in Market! Market!, Festival Mall, Trinoma, SM Sta. Mesa, Robinsons Galleria, SM North Edsa, SM City Manila and SM Megamall. This is after general cinema attendance was low on the first week of Echorsis' screening even for Hollywood-produced films. This low attendance was attributed by producer Cahillig to the high heat index recorded. Reception =Critical reception= Film critic Philbert Dy of ClickTheCity.com described the film as a \\"subversive little gem\\" and praised its bold depiction of the LGBT community. He also named the film as the \\"spiritual successor\\" of Zombadings. Another critic and writer, Oggs Cruz of Rappler, described the film as doing what it sets out to do which is \\"entertain while deliberately forwarding a pervasive agenda.\\" In September, 2017, \\"Echorsis\\" won the Best Comedy/ Musical Film trophy in the 4th Urduja Heritage Film Awards 2017. The film tied with the critically acclaimed \\"Die Beautiful\\" directed by Jun Lana.

He was described as able but humourless. Together with contemporaries such as Robert Dundas he was part of what was called the Scotch Ministry in parliament in the late 18th century. Dr Samuel Johnson described him as \\"a vile Whig\\" however his friend James Boswell was less condemning, saying \\"few people were but mixed character, like a candle: half wax, half tallow- but Sir Adam Fergusson was all wax, with a pure taper, whom you may light and set upon any lady‚Äôs table\\". Robert Burns who knew Fergusson through his Ayr connections, called him \\"the oath-detesting, chaste, Kilkerran\\".http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/FergussonofKilkerranSirAdam17331511813.350.shtml Boswell described him as \\"his excellent friend\\". Life He was born in Ayrshire on 7 May 1733 the oldest surviving son of Lady Jean Maitland, daughter of Viscount Maitland, and Sir James Fergusson, 2nd Baronet. His younger brother was George Fergusson. He attended Maybole School before studying law at the University of Edinburgh qualifying as an advocate in 1755. He then spent a year in Brussels doing further legal studies before undertaking a Grand Tour of Europe as was the fashion of the day, 1757-58. In 1759 his father died and he inherited his estates and baronetcy. At this point, he and his friend George Dempster of Dunnichen both decided to go into politics. Fergusson stood for the Ayr Burghs against Patrick Craufurd. His youth (26 years old) did not stand him in good stead, and he was forced to withdraw 10 days before the election, much to his embarrassment. This experience jaded him against politics for a few years. As an advocate he won fame in pursuing the young Countess of Sutherland‚Äôs claims to the peerage. In 1774 he re-entered politics with a somewhat ironic slogan of being \\"a champion of the county against aristocratic influence\\" (referring to more senior members of the aristocracy rather than himself). In this venture he was backed by the Lord President, Robert Dundas and his brother Henry. They provided a fall-back position of standing for the Linlithgow Burghs should he not win Ayrshire but this proved unnecessary as he won the Ayrshire seat. http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/fergusson- sir-adam-1733-1813 His first recorded speech in Parliament was on 26 October 1775 when he spoke out advocating strong measures be taken against the United States of America. On 24 November 1775 he seems to sway in the other direction, insisting that the government consult parliament before sending Hanoverian troops to either Gibraltar or Menorca. His interests focussed upon topics such as the Scottish Militia and subjects such as the bill to curtail adultery in 1779. In 1779 he also spoke against Henry Cavendish in his proposal to remove troops from America to concentrate on the wars with France.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/fergusson- sir-adam-1733-1813 He was re-elected on petition for Ayrshire in 1781, winning against the peers‚Äô choice of Hugh Montgomerie. In this second session he was more trusted and selected for a secret committee to investigate the cause of the wars in the Carnatic region of southern India. In July he was given an important place on the Board of Trade. He was a strong but silent supporter of Lord North. In further years he spoke against the turnpike taxes in their impact upon Scotland, and the curious bills prohibiting the growth of tobacco in Britain, and taxing soap. He later supported Pitt, but criticised delays in the passing of the Mutiny Bill.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/fergusson- sir-adam-1733-1813 Fergusson was a partner of the disastrous bank Douglas, Heron & Company.http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/DouglasHeronampCompany.294.shtml In 1783 he was a founding member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and in 1786 founded the British Fishery Society. At the next election in August 1784, by agreement with Dundas and others, he stood down in Ayrshire to allow Hugh Montgomerie success, and instead was offered James Hunter Blair‚Äôs seat in Edinburgh. However, he received no office in this new role. He voted for Parliamentary Reform in 1785. His period as an Edinburgh MP was relatively silent.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/fergusson- sir-adam-1733-1813 In 1790 he returned as an MP for Ayrshire. In 1791 Pitt suggested him as Surveyor of Crown Lands to the King but this was not accepted. His health was failing and he spoke little. He did not seek re- election in 1796.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/fergusson- sir-adam-1733-1813 In 1796 he unsuccessfully claimed the title of Earl of Glencairn (through his mother‚Äôs lineage). He spent his final years as an advocate. He died on 25 September 1813. He never married.

The treaty became the legal basis for the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, and its successor, the Western Group of Forces to maintain its presence in Germany following the end of the Soviet Occupation. History Following the German Instrument of Surrender on 8 May 1945, which formally ended the Second World War in Europe, Germany was split into four occupation zones. The French, American, and British zones would eventually merge to become the Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany, while the Soviet zone, due to the ensuing Cold War, would eventually become the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany.http://m.scmp.com/article/19696/division- germany-after-wwii The Red Army maintained a significant force in its occupation territory for the four years following the end of the war, mostly as a bulwark against the armies of the West stationed in Western Europe, which became increasingly hostile towards each other as the Cold War escalated. On 7 October 1949, the German Democratic Republic was officially established.https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_German_Democratic_Republic_(1949) The Soviet Union, realizing that a war against NATO would likely be fought in Central Europe, and particularly in Germany, realized that it would need to continue maintaining a large presence in East Germany. On 9 May 1955, four months before the signing of the treaty, West Germany joined NATO. This was seen as a largely hostile move against the Soviet Union, and consequently the Soviet Union founded its own defense organisation, the Warsaw Pact, along with East Germany, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Albania, on 14 May 1955, in anticipation of the remilitarized West Germany, stating that \\"a remilitarized Western Germany and the integration of the latter in the North-Atlantic bloc [...] increase the danger of another war and constitutes a threat to the national security of the peaceable states; [...] in these circumstances the peaceable European states must take the necessary measures to safeguard their security\\". The Treaty The treaty was officially signed and enacted on 20 September 1955. Among its stipulations were an agreement that \\"the Soviet troops temporarily stationed in the GDR with the consent of its government do not interfere in the country‚Äôs domestic affairs and social and political life.\\"http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Soviet- German+Agreements Also stated was that the GDR was to continue exercising protection and control of its borders, but until a further agreement was reached, the Soviet Army Command in Germany was to \\"control the movement of American, French, and British personnel and cargoes entering and exiting West Berlin.http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Soviet-German+Agreements This provision may have been added in case the Soviet Union wished to try to force the Western Allies to withdraw from West Berlin by cutting off the railways and roads leading in from East Germany, as they tried, and failed to do in 1948-49 during the Berlin Airlift, in response to the Western Allies issuing a new currency into their sector, further destabilizing the East German economy. Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, was said to have famously remarked, \\" Berlin is the testicles of the West. When I want to make the West scream, I squeeze Berlin!\\" Aftermath Towards the end of the 1980s, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact States began to splinter. A series of protests in East Germany known as the Peaceful Revolution occurred and as a result, on 18 March 1990, East Germany's first free election occurred. The newly formed government began a series of negotiations with West Germany, ultimately resulting in reunification. The Soviet Army would maintain varying degrees of troops in East Germany, and the territory of the former GDR until the Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, when its successor, the Russian Federation would take over. The forces in Germany were renamed the Western Group of Forces in 1989, and halted all maneuvers and military exercises by 1993, due to the reduction of tensions with the West following the period of Perestroika in the 1980s, and finally the Fall of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw pact, and a more liberal form of government being established. All Russian troops would leave Germany by 1994, in what has been called the largest peaceful movement of troops in history.

They are thought to date from the Bronze Age but their origins and purpose are unclear. They are about high and are a similar distance apart. Stones The stones are located behind the farmhouse of Plas Meilw, some southwest of Holyhead and a similar distance south of Holyhead Mountain. Little is known about the history of the stones. They are believed to be between 3,500 and 4,000 years old and are a Scheduled ancient monument. The exposed part of each stone is about high and broad at the base, but only about thick. They are situated about apart on an open grassy place above Porth Dafarch between two low hills. They are aligned along their long axes in a northeasterly/southwesterly direction, with a fine view of the coast and towards Holyhead Mountain. There are theories that they may have formed part of a stone circle, however there is no evidence to support this. It is also said that there was previously a stone cist between them, but again this story lacks supporting evidence.

It is long and runs from Saltaire in West Yorkshire to Appleby-in-Westmorland, Cumbria, roughly parallel to the line of the Settle and Carlisle Railway. Route The Dales High Way starts at Saltaire, a World Heritage Site model village in the City of Bradford, West Yorkshire, built by Titus Salt on the River Aire. It climbs up over Ilkley Moor, passing the Twelve Apostles stone circle and the Swastika Stone, and drops down to the outskirts of Addingham before rising to follow high ground south of the A65 road, including Skipton Moor, and then enters the town of Skipton. From here it passes through Flasby and Hetton and crosses the inlet to Winterburn Reservoir before climbing to cross the watershed between Wharfedale and Airedale and drop to the bridge below Gordale Scar. It rises to the limestone pavement above Malham Cove, where it crosses the Pennine Way and continues across Kirkby Fell on the way to Settle. From Settle the route follows Ribblesdale to Stainforth, then goes by way of Feizor and Wharfe before heading for the summit of Ingleborough, one of the Yorkshire Three Peaks and the highest point on the route at . From here it drops down to Chapel-le-Dale and runs below Whernside near the Ribblehead Viaduct, going alongside the railway before crossing Whernside's northern slopes to head for Dentdale and share the route of the Dales Way through Dent. It leaves the Dales Way and Dentdale to follow higher ground to the north to reach Sedbergh. From Sedbergh the path traverses the Howgill Fells, passing over Calders and the highest point of the Howgills, The Calf (), before following the ridge over Hazelgill Knott down to cross the River Lune near Newbiggin-on-Lune. It climbs over Ravenstonedale Moor to cross the watershed into the catchment of the River Eden, dropping down to Great Asby and following Hoff Beck through Hoff before crossing a final low ridge to reach Appleby-in-Westmorland. The total ascent in the 90 miles of the route is 4,268 m (14,003 ft) The route is roughly parallel to the Settle and Carlisle Railway, so walkers can walk sections of the path while using the railway stations at Saltaire, Ilkley (on the line to Bradford), Skipton, Gargrave Settle, Horton-in-Ribblesdale, Ribblehead, Dent (some 5 miles (8 km) from and above the village of that name), Garsdale (for Sedbergh), Kirkby Stephen and Appleby. Ingleborough, the highest point of the path History The path was conceived by husband and wife Tony and Chris Grogan in 2007, as a high-level alternative to the established Dales Way which runs from Ilkley to Windermere largely along Wharfedale and other valleys. They published two books, a Route Guide (2008) and a Companion (2009). Waymarking The path's waymark is a circular blue and purple symbol bearing the name and web address of the path. Waymarking began in June 2012 after extensive negotiations with the four local authorities through whose areas the path passes (Bradford, North Yorkshire, the Yorkshire Dales National Park and Cumbria), and was completed in 2013. Waymarks are placed where the route leaves metalled roads and at key junctions, but the route is not waymarked in open country; walkers need to use a map. Recognition Since March 2014 the route has been shown on Ordnance Survey leisure maps, and it is recognised by the Long Distance Walkers Association. It is described on Bradford's official tourism site and the Yorkshire Dales National Park's website. An informal \\"Friends of A Dales High Way\\" group has been established.

Description The image is an oil painting on a lime wood board, executed in landscape format with the dimensions 186.1 x 120.6 centimeters. It shows on the bottom center, a winged serpent in flight from Cranach's workshop and the year 1546.Katalog der Gem√§ldegalerie Berlin. Berlin-Dahlem 1975, S. 118 f.http://lucascranach.org/DE_smbGG_593 It shows a fountain where older women but not men bathe, are rejuvenated and finally indulge in music, dance and good food. Cranach presents in this fairy tale image, in many details the real bathing culture of the Middle Ages, that based on the belief that certain baths might heal and rejuvenate. Sensual pleasures belonged to the bathroom now. The picture belonged to the inventory of the former Prussian royal palaces, and now hangs in the Gem√§ldegalerie museum in Berlin.Henning Bock, Irene Geismeier, Rainald Grosshans, Jan Kelch, Wilhelm H. K√∂hler, Rainer Michaelis, Hannelore N√ºtzmann, Erich Schleier: Gem√§ldegalerie Berlin. Gesamtverzeichnis. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Berlin 1996, . Analysis The background depicts a fantastic rocky landscape with unreal perspectives and proportions. A miniature castle on a rock can be seen on the far left, leaning over a cliff. In the center background a medieval city view is painted with a stone arch bridge over a river, which leads to the town. On the right a mighty mountain range is surrounded with lush fields and fruit trees. The barren rock on the left half symbolizes the arduous age of women, whilst the dense green forest on the right acts as a metaphor for youth. The basin, which covers the center foreground, is shown from a high point of view and is depicted as a square, surrounded by steps leading into the basin. The column-shaped fountain in the middle of the pool is crowned with the figures of Venus and Cupid, suggesting that the bath serves the force of love. The foreground shows us the effect of the fountain, with elderly women, frail and worn, some even unable to walk, being led to the pool. They undress, get into the healing water, and appear rejuvenated on the right side of the pool, where a gallant young man shows them into a tent. Here the women get dressed before they can move on to indulge in sensual pleasures, as suggested in the right background, where young couples are dancing and dining to music.Dierk Spreen: \\"Die kurze Geschichte der Zeitmaschine\\". in: Quarre Merkur 89/90. 1999, Nr. 36. S. 111‚Äì113.) On the left edge of the pool we can see a man in a red jacket holding a book. He gazes at one of the elderly nude women, which suggests that he is a scholar or doctor, examining the effect of the fountain. On the edge of the basin, two women wrapped in towels are shown. These women, of which one sits at the front left corner and the other at the center bottom of the basin, seem to be reluctant to get into the water, doubting whether a rejuvenated life is even desirable. The fact that only women attend this bath, is due to the belief that older men would automatically rejuvenate in dealing with young women. In reality such alleged healing springs were also visited by men. In Cranach's picture all men are young, represented gallant and advantageous towards the elder women, however ugly and unattractive. Spread over the entire image, Cranach's figures refer to the individual stages of supernatural transformation: it is the search for paradise. The picture shows a man's dream. Bathing was associated with health, which easily led to the belief in broader effects of water, as shown by baptismal rites of religions. The fountain was a popular motif in medieval narratives, especially in medieval French literature, and offered versatile opportunities for depictions of nudes and genre scenes. The presentation of old naked women is very uncommon for the art of this period: idealized nudes of young men and women were a more widespread genre. The beauty ideal for women in Cranach's age consisted of a bulging belly, round shapes without pubic hair, high-set breasts with small nipples and fair hair. Most of the figures in Cranach's work follow the ideals of beauty of the time and leads experts to believe that this painting is by his hand. However, the attribution of the picture is not certain. Research calls both Lucas Cranach the Elder and his son as the author. Lately it is associated with the late work of the father, but other employees of the Cranach workshop were probably involved in the execution. It is believed that the painting was commissioned, by an unknown client. Provenance By 1830, the fountain was part of the management of the royal palaces. Then it came to the Royal Museum and now hangs in the Gem√§ldegalerie in Berlin. References Sources * Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub: Der Jungbrunnen, 1549. (= Der Kunstbrief. 4).

He served as Legal Adviser of the Department of State from 1979 to 1981 and acted as a mediator and arbitrator in several international disputes. Early life Owen was born in Boston and attended Phillips Exeter Academy. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II before receiving undergraduate and law degrees at Harvard University in 1948 and 1951, respectively. He then attended Queens' College, Cambridge on a Fulbright Scholarship.Smith. Owen began practicing law at Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C., in 1952, later becoming a partner of that firm.Carter. Iran Hostage Crisis and Algiers Accords President Jimmy Carter appointed Owen to be the U.S. State Department Legal Adviser in 1979.Carter. A few weeks after Owen took office, the Iran hostage crisis began in November 1979.Smith. In 1980, Owen argued on behalf of the United States in its case against Iran before the International Court of Justice at The Hague.Westwood, p. 148. Owen also participated in negotiations with Iranian representatives in Algiers in late 1980 and early 1981 as a member of the team led by Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Owen played a role in drafting the Algiers Accords that led to the January 1981 release of the U.S. embassy personnel being held captive in Tehran.Christopher, p. 113.Smith. At the end of the Carter Administration, Owen returned to the practice of law at Covington & Burling, from which he retired in 1996.Smith. Balkans Conflict and Dayton Accords In 1995, then-Secretary of State Warren Christopher asked Owen to assist negotiator Richard Holbrooke in efforts to resolve conflicts arising from the Breakup of Yugoslavia. As part of Holbrooke's delegation during negotiations with the combatants, Owen acted as a mediator and the draftsman of proposals that led to the Dayton Agreement.Smith. According to Holbrooke, after one occasion in which the \\"normally dignified\\" Owen expressed his frustration with the behavior of one Bosnian negotiator by slamming his fist against a wall, his American colleagues gave him the sobriquet \\"Mad Dog.\\" Holbrooke, p. 197 In 1996, the president of the International Court of Justice appointed Owen to act as presiding arbitrator of the Arbitral Tribunal for the Dispute Over the Inter-Entity Boundary in the Brcko Area, a special ICJ tribunal established to determine the status of the Brcko District, which had not been resolved by the Dayton Agreement. As presiding arbitrator, Owen ruled that the Brcko District would constitute a Condominium (international law) under the direct jurisdiction of the federal authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina and outside the jurisdiction of either the Republika Srpska or the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the result of Owen's decision, the Brcko District became largely self-governing. While some aspects of Owen's arbitral decision in the Brcko Arbitration have been characterized as controversial,Geohegan one former American diplomat opined that Owen's \\"solution to the impasse over Brcko's political status will surely go down in the annals of peacemaking as one of its finer moments.\\"Farrand, p. xiv. In another role as international arbitrator, the Republic of Venezuela appointed Owen in 1996 as one of three arbitrators for an proceeding administered by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes to resolve an investor-state dispute against the Republic.

It is the sixth and longest track on the Cinematic Orchestra's second studio album, Every Day (2003). Composition British rapper Roots Manuva provides vocals for the track. The track begins with a sampling from composer John Barry's soundtrack from the 1968 motion picture Petulia. After different instrumental variations and the addition of a bass rhythm, the track introduces rapper Roots Manuva with a 4 minute long segment over the original sampling. In his lyrics, he references the TARDIS, a fictional spacecraft used in the popular science fiction television series Doctor Who, as well as American singer-songwriter Michael Jackson. The track then tones down in intensity to a piano riff, and eventually finishing with a Harp solo by Welsh musician Rhodri Davies. At just over 11 minutes long at extended length, it is the longest track on the album Every Day. Reception John Bush of the online music guide service AllMusic describes the track as a \\"magisterial , spoken-word quasi-autobiography.\\" Paul Cooper of Pitchfork said the song is \\"contemplative, doubting, restless. For the performance of his career, Roots Manuva drops his Stockwell rudie schtick for a philosophical self-examination that never descends into navel-gazing or therapy-babble.\\" In a review for Every Day for BBC Music, Peter Marsh describes the track as \\"a cooly minimalist atmospheric funk workout complete with typically off beat rhymes from Roots Manuva and a lovely, kora-like Rhodri Davies harp solo.\\" The song has been used in various different programmes and films, including the closing soundtrack to the 2006 drama film Kidulthood, the television series Hustle, soap opera Hollyoaks and the documentary series Wonders of the Solar System.

He was born into an Aromanian family in Avdella, a village that formed part of the Ottoman Empire's Manastir Vilayet and is now in Greece. He attended primary school in his native village, followed from 1902 to 1912 by studies at the Romanian high schools in Ioannina and Bitola. From 1912 to 1916, he went to the literature and philosophy faculty of Bucharest University. In 1925, he obtained a doctorate in philology from the same institution; his thesis dealt with the Maramure»ô dialect and folklore. He was a high school teacher at T√¢rgu Neam»õ from 1916 to 1918. Papahagi was then hired at his alma mater, where he rose from teaching assistant (1920-1925) to docent (1926-1928), associate professor (1928-1943) and full professor (1943-1948). His first book was a printed conference report, the 1915 Arom√¢nii din punct de vedere istoric, cultural »ôi politic. In 1927, he started a course on Romanian linguistic ethnography, the first of its kind. His contributions appeared in Grai »ôi suflet, Langue et litt√©rature and Viea»õa nouƒÉ. His research was consistently interdisciplinary, combining ethnography, folklore and dialectology, and analyzing phenomena from comparatist, Romance and Balkan perspectives. A good part of his work dealt with the literary, folk and religious corpus in the Aromanian language, and was aimed at making it known and emphasizing its value. An early text in this direction was Antologie arom√¢neascƒÉ (1922). His studies of ethnography and folklore (among them Images d‚Äôethnographie roumaine, vol. I-III, 1928-1934; Macedorom√¢nii say arom√¢nii, 1927; Arom√¢nii.

It was the band's first release on VHS, being released in 1985. Background After a Christmas tour in 1981, Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel would not embark on another tour again until 1989. However, the band did perform three odd shows during 1983 and 1984, including the Reading Festival in 1983 and the Camden Palace in London on 14 December 1984. The London show was the last the band would perform until 1989, and was the debut performance for band's new violinist/guitarist Barry Wickens.http://www.barrywickens.com/#!biography/c1enr The Camden Palace concert was recorded for a one-hour TV special broadcast, and then released on VHS the following year. Filmed by Trilion Pictures Ltd., the VHS was released via Castle Communications Plc.. It was directed by Marc Over and produced by Philip Goodhand-Tait. The footage features fifteen tracks, discounting the 'Live from London' title music, which was counted as a separate track on the VHS track-listing. Accessed on 26 February 2016. Trilion Pictures Ltd would film two other Camden Palace concerts during 1984 for the British heavy metal band Girlschool and Canadian heavy metal band Thor. Castle Communications Plc. would also release these two concerts on VHS, as Play Dirty Live (Girlschool) and Live in London (Thor), similar to that of the Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel release. Release Live from London was released on VHS through Castle Communications Plc in 1985. Despite the back cover listing 16 tracks in total, the last two \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and \\"(I Believe) Love's a Prima Donna\\" did not actually appear on the release, suggesting they were recorded during the concert but not included on the VHS. In 2001, the concert was given its first DVD release through CP Entertainment as part of their 'Legends of Rock' series. The footage was digitally remastered for the DVD. CP Entertainment released two different editions of the DVD, one of which was a 'Collectors Edition' and featured different artwork, though both editions shared the same catalogue number. The Collectors Edition DVD had the bonus feature of being a DVD Plus flip-disc, meaning that an audio CD version of the concert was placed on the other side of the DVD disc. On 26 February 2007, Live from London was given a new DVD release through Rhino. Another DVD release followed on 11 June 2012, when it was released by the Store for Music. This version of the concert came with a bonus feature of a previously unseen photo gallery, featuring photographs taken from the same concert. On 24 March 2017, the Store for Music released the concert on CD and as an audio download.https://www.amazon.co.uk/London-Steve-Harley-Cockney- Rebel/dp/B01N6ZA8HF/ Track listing =VHS track listing= # \\"Live from London - Title Music\\" (Spaniel Music) # \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" (George Harrison) # \\"I Can't Even Touch You\\" (Steve Harley) # \\"Freedom's Prisoner\\" (Harley) # \\"Judy Teen\\" (Harley) # \\"I Just Wanna Be a Star\\" (Harley) # \\"Irresistible\\" (Harley) # \\"Sebastian\\" (Harley) # \\"Riding the Waves\\" (Harley) # \\"Promises\\" (Harley) # \\"Mr Soft\\" (Harley) # \\"Sling It!\\" (Harley) # \\"Make Me Smile\\" (Harley) # \\"Tumbling Down\\" (Harley) # \\"Sweet Dreams\\" (Harley) # \\"(I Believe) Love's a Prima Donna\\" (Harley) *Though listed on the VHS, \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and \\"(I Believe) Love's a Prima Donna\\" were not included in the footage. =DVD track listing= # \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" # \\"I Can't Even Touch You\\" # \\"Freedom's Prisoner\\" # \\"Judy Teen\\" # \\"I Just Wanna Be a Star\\" # \\"Irresistible\\" # \\"Sebastian\\" # \\"Riding the Waves\\" # \\"Promises\\" # \\"Mr Soft\\" # \\"Sling It!\\" # \\"Make Me Smile\\" # \\"Tumbling Down\\" Critical reception Of the 2001 DVD release of Live from London, Mike Sutton of the website The Digital Fix commented: \\"Considering that Steve Harley wrote one of the defining songs of the seventies - the sublime \\"(Come Up And See Me) Make Me Smile\\" - it's fair to say that I had fairly positive expectations of this concert DVD. While these weren't totally dashed, I have to admit that I wasn't particularly impressed. The music isn't bad at all but the presentation of the DVD is disappointing. The songs are generally of a pretty high standard, although these live versions aren't a patch on the original records. The quality of the picture is mediocre at best. Although this release is superior to some of the others released by CP, it's certainly not an essential purchase. Even fans of Steve Harley are likely to be a little disappointed by the poor visual quality of the concert.\\" Personnel =Cockney Rebel= * Steve Harley - lead vocals, guitar * Rick Driscoll - lead guitar * Alan Darby - lead guitar * Barry Wickens - violin * Ian Keller - keyboards * Kevin Powell - bass guitar * Lindsay Elliott - drums * Martin Jay - backing vocals * Suzanne Murphy - backing vocals =Concert crew= * Roy Wood - sound engineer * Mick Gibbs - sound recording * Steve Harley - sound mix * Steve Hills - sound mix * Scott Thompson - monitor engineer * Dave Thomas - backline technician * Clive Davies - lighting designer * Leanne Bogen - graphics =Video production team= * Marc Over - director * Philip Goodhand-Tait - producer * Trilion Pictures Ltd. - studio * Castle Communications Plc. - label References Category:Live video albums Category:1985 video albums ","title":"Live from London (Steve Harley &amp; Cockney Rebel video)"},{"id":"50411127","text":"Statistics from the 2015‚Äì16 season.

He was unbeaten in his native country, winning the Argentinian Triple Crown and being named Horse of the Year in 1966. He was imported to the United States in 1967 and won two of his three races before he was retired from racing. He stood as a breeding stallion in Kentucky and had considerable success as a sire of winners: he had a long-term influence on racing through his daughter Special, an influential broodmare. Forli died in 1988. Background Forli was a chestnut horse bred in Argentina by the Haras Ojo de Agua. He was sired by Aristophanes, a British stallion imported to Argentina after having shown good, but unexceptional form in his native country. He made a great impact as a breeding stallion and was the Leading sire in Argentina in 1960. Forli's dam Trevisa was a successful broodmare and a half sister to La Dogana, whose descendants included Crow. Forli was first raced in the ownership of Jorge Azevedo and was trained in Argentina by Juan Lapistoy. Racing career Forli was unbeaten in three races as a juvenile. As a three-year-old Forli won the Argentinian Triple Crown, winning the Gran Premio Polla De Potrillos, Gran Premio Jockey Club, and Gran Premio Nacional. When matched against older horse he won Argentina's premier weight-for-age, the Gran Premio Carlos Pellegrini. He ended his South American career unbeaten in seven starts. In 1967 Forli was bought by Arthur B. Hancock, Jr. of Claiborne Farm for $60,000, and was transferred to the United States where he was trained by Charles E. Whittingham. He won on his North American debut setting a track record of 1:41.2 when winning the Coronado Handicap over eight and a half furlongs at Hollywood Park Racetrack in May. Forli then developed leg problems and was pinfired before returning to win an exhibition race at Hollywood in July. He suffered his first and only defeat in the Citation Handicap at Arlington Park when he finished second to Dominar. Stud record Forli was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at Claiborne. He died in 1988 and was buried at Claiborne Farm.

He was born into a musical family of Dutch provenance.Horst Bergmeier, Rainer Lotz: Die Familie Bruinier. In: Fox auf 78, Heft 12, Sommer 1993, ISSN 0948-0412 Life August Heinrich Bruinier was born in Zweibr√ºcken, close to the French frontier. His father, Jan Berend Hendrik Bruinier (1863‚Äì1934) had been born in Amsterdam, but lived in Germany where he worked as the chief executive officer (Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer) of a manufacturing company in the heavy industrial sector. His mother, born Sophie Christiane Henriette Wagner, came from a German family. The family was an unusually musical one: of the parents' six recorded children, three grew up to become professional musicians. Between 1904 and 1907 he attended the \\"Realgymnasium\\" (secondary school) in Biebrich, near Wiesbaden before moving to the rapidly expanding Berlin conurbation where from 1907 till 1913 he attended an \\"Oberrealschule\\" (senior secondary school) in Steglitz. Bruinier started his formal musical training as a pupil of the violinist between 1912 and 1914. He studied at the Berlin Music Academy from 1914 till 1917, and was then able to get away from the war playing as a member of the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra between 1917 and 1918. Between 1918 and 1920 he progressed his studies at the Berlin Music Academy, now studying with Karl Klingler. He continued to take lessons privately in 1920/1921 with Willy Hess and Gabriele Wietrowetz (1866-1937). He was Concert Master with the Berlin Academic Orchestra (\\"Akademische Orchester Berlin\\") from 1923 till 1925, and was also at this stage already giving violin lessons.Karla H√∂cker: Hauskonzerte in Berlin. Rembrandt, Berlin 1970, P. 71, 98 & 107 In the \\"Society for Modern Musical presentation in Berlin\\", which Othmar Steinbauer and Max Deutsch had created (based on the example of Schoenberg's Society for Private Musical Performances in Vienna), Bruinier was the leader of the \\"House quartet\\". He was also a member, with , of the \\"Old German Chamber Quartet\\" (\\"Altdeutsche Kammerquartett\\"). Between 1928 and 1937 Bruinier worked as concert master for the Tobis Film company: from 1937 he was employed in the same position at Berlin's Nollendorf Square Theatre (as it was then known). Between 1943 and 1963 he taught the violin at the Braunschweig District Music Academy. Along with this, between 1951 and 1961 he held summer chamber music courses in the hills south of W√ºrzburg, for JMI at Schloss Weikersheim.

Members were, apart from him playing the 1st violin, Marg. Schmidt-Laipa and later Fritz Wehmeyer (1906‚Äì1973) (2nd violin), from 1927 to 1937 Karla H√∂cker, followed by Karl Reitz (viola) and Hans Chemin-Petit, Paul Blumenfeld (1901‚Äì2001) (1929 bis 1932) and Karl Dechert (* 1906 ‚Ä† ?)

He was a speaker with Ravi Zacharias International Ministries (RZIM) from 2013 until 2016 and the author of three books, Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus: A Devout Muslim Encounters Christianity (Zondervan, February 2014), Answering Jihad: A Better Way Forward (Zondervan, March 2016), and No God But One‚ÄîAllah or Jesus (Zondervan, August 2016).  Background  Qureshi was born in San Diego, California to Pakistani parents who immigrated to the United States. With his father in the U.S. Navy, he moved many times as a youth before settling in Virginia. In 2001 he attended Old Dominion University and served as the president of the Pre-Medical Honor Society. Qureshi also studied Islamic apologetics and engaged Christians in religious discussions. After one such discussion with a Christian at Old Dominion University, David Wood, the two became friends and began a years-long debate on the historical claims of Christianity and Islam. Qureshi's resulting conversion to Christianity was chronicled in his first book, Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus. In addition to being a New York Times bestseller, Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus was awarded the Christian Book Award for the categories of both \\"Best New Author\\" and \\"Best Non-Fiction\\" of 2015, the first time in award history. Christianity Today heralded Qureshi as one of \\"33 Under 33\\" in its cover story on emerging religious leaders in July 2014. Qureshi attended medical school at the Eastern Virginia Medical School after graduating from Old Dominion University. After completing his medical degree, Qureshi decided to spend his life studying and preaching the Christian Gospel and became a speaker for the Ravi Zacharias International Ministries. He subsequently completed three more master's degrees in theology and religious studies and was pursuing doctoral studies at the University of Oxford at the time of his death. Qureshi lectured to students at more than 100 universities, including Oxford, Columbia, Dartmouth, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Hong Kong. He has participated in 18 moderated, public debates around North America, Europe, and Asia. In 2015, Qureshi debated at Wayne State University with Muslim scholar Shabir Ally. Qureshi was married to Michelle. The couple had one daughter, Ayah born in August 2015. 2010 arrest in Dearborn Beginning in the late 2000s, Qureshi began attending the Dearborn Arab Festival. In 2009, Qureshi, and other members of Acts 17 Apologetics were kicked out of the fair for allegations that they were passing out Christian literature. Different narratives of the issue exist and in the end a court ruled in favour of Qureshi. Reportedly, Qureshi walked up to a booth with the sign \\"Got Questions? We've got answers,\\" picked up a brochure on Islam and asked a question, as the booth's sign invited anyone to do. As Qureshi was engaged in conversation, a Muslim man walked by, snatched the brochure out of Qureshi's hand, and approached security personnel with it. Security personnel used this to create a confrontation with Qureshi and his colleagues, telling them to leave without telling them why, and ultimately assaulting them. According to the police, they received a complaint from a Christian volunteer at the festival regarding the behavior of the Acts 17 Apologetics. At the time of their arrest they were not passing out flyers, but engaging passers-by in a confrontational debate causing a large crowd to gather. Due to their behavior the crowd gathered to the point where it violated the City of Dearborn Misdemeanor Ordinances of Breach of Peace and Failure to Obey the Lawful Order of a Police Officer. After their arrest the crowd dispersed. It was alleged that those arrested were not in a public space, nor in the space allotted by the festival for passing out flyers at the time of their arrest. A number of other Christian groups were at the festival including the well-known Christian minister Josh McDowell, who spoke with festival attendees regarding Christianity and the New Testament. Returning in 2010, Qureshi and his colleagues resolved not to engage anyone in conversation unless it was initiated by someone else. Furthermore, the members of Acts 17 Apologetics filmed the entirety of their interactions, as they had done the previous year. During the 2010 Festival, Qureshi was shown being asked questions by a small crowd of Muslim teenagers. Police officers soon arrested the group and confiscated their video cameras, charging Qureshi with disturbing the peace and refusing a lawful order from a police officer. Qureshi and his group spent a night in jail for this arrest. Soon after the arrest, Dearborn mayor John B. O'Reilly, Jr. released a statement indicating that the missionaries were engaged in hostile, angry shouts with the crowd, blocking access to the booths. The mayor stated that Qureshi was getting violent and confrontational with police officers attempting to peacefully calm the situation. ‚ÄúThe real violation of First Amendment rights occurs with Acts 17 Apologetics trying to imply they were the victim,‚Äù Mayor O‚ÄôReilly said, ‚ÄùWhen the real violation is their attack on the City of Dearborn for having tolerance for all religions including believers in the Qur‚Äôan.‚Äùhttps://www.arabamericannews.com/2010/07/16/Mayor-defends-arrests-of- missionaries-at-festival/ After reviewing the video evidence, a jury found Qureshi not guilty on all counts. A separate civil suit found that Dearborn, Michigan had violated Qureshi's constitutional rights, finding that there was no basis in law for his arrest. In 2013, the city then settled the suit. As part of the settlement, the city had to issue a formal apology and maintain that apology on their website for three years.  Commentary on international Muslim terrorism  Qureshi commented on international Muslim terrorism in several media outlets, including USA Today, Fox News, Newsmax TV, TheBlaze and the Huffington Post where he detailed his conversion to Christianity and his belief that Islam is an \\"inherently violent religion\\".  Cancer diagnosis and death  On 30 August 2016, Qureshi announced that he was in the advanced stages of stomach cancer. Qureshi took to his Facebook page to inform fans and followers of his illness saying the prognosis was \\"quite grim.\\" \\"This is an announcement that I never expected to make, but God in His infinite and sovereign wisdom has chosen me for this refining, and I pray He will be glorified through my body and my spirit,\\" Qureshi wrote. \\"My family and I have received the news that I have advanced stomach cancer, and the clinical prognosis is quite grim. Nonetheless, we are going to pursue healing aggressively, both medical and miraculous, relying on God and the fact that He is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine.\\" Qureshi died of stomach cancer on September 16, 2017, at the age of 34.\\"Christian Apologist Nabeel Qureshi Dies at 34\\", by Edward Shih, The Gospel Herald  Featured dedication  Nabeel was featured in a 2018 documentary, American Gospel. American Gospel was created in response to the Prosperity Gospel movement that is largely popular throughout the United States and the Western world today. The film was dedicated to him, since he passed away from cancer before it was completed. In the film, he discusses the importance of sharing the Good News of the Gospel with others.

Quiet Power is an adaptation for children and teens, and for their educators and parents, of Cain's 2012 adult-audience book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking. Background Susan Cain's 2012 book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking reached The New York Times best seller list and Time magazine's cover, and was the subject of one of the most-watched TED Talks. In 2015 Cain co- founded Quiet Revolution, a company that produces content, including online training courses for parents, about and for introverts. Quiet Power constitutes Cain's focus on introverted children and teens, especially in the context of schools, so that the next generation of introverts doesn't grow up feeling there is something wrong with them or repress their personality trait. Cain's co-authors Erica Moroz and Gregory Mone are, respectively, a journalist and a writer of children's books; illustrator Grant Snider was discovered through his comics that were inspired by Cain's 2012 Quiet. Content Quiet Power discusses the distinction between introversion and shyness; deeper student engagement versus conventional expectations of class participation; speaking in front of groups; individual versus group work; introvert-friendly methods of structuring group work; and use of social media in education. The book focuses on shyness in addition to introversion, saying that shyness involves fear of social judgment. Cain says that while shyness may be something to overcome, introversion can be something to celebrate, adding that introspection tends to come with \\"superpowers\\" such as listening ability, empathy, deeper study, and longer focus. The book includes chapters on school, socializing, hobbies, and home, and incorporates firsthand accounts of introverted teens and of famous figures who have succeeded outside of their initial comfort zones. Cain included new research in Quiet Power that was not present in the adult-audience Quiet, and recast it especially for 10- to 14-year-olds who would be less able than high schoolers to translate the workplace-oriented Quiet into their own world. The book also includes appendices for teachers and parents. Saying that adolescence is the hardest period in an introvert's life, Cain suggests that young introverts talk with others about their desired socializing style (to avoid misunderstandings), find activities about which they can be passionate (to motivate stepping outside their comfort zones), focus on their strengths (to remain true to themselves), and be open to extroverted people (as having complementary abilities). Cain critiques schools' clustered desks, infatuation with group projects, and rewards for students who are quickest to speak. Cain instead favors recognition of deep focus and talent for listening with empathy and patience, noting that in the business world people don't read books together or write memos together. The Quiet Revolution (company) created a Quiet Schools Network to partner with educators to design techniques to develop the talents of introverted students, such as by beginning public speaking programs with lower-anxiety assignments and incrementally increasing challenges as the student progresses. Cain encourages parents, first, to understand that introverts' nerve biologies react more strongly to stimulation, and that the reactions can be draining through no preference of their own. Also, Cain urges parents to help their children be \\"intelligent consumers\\" of social media with its constant personal evaluation, despite its enabling introverts to communicate \\"without being at the party.\\" Reception Quiet Power started at #4 on The New York Times bestseller list (children's middle grade hardcover category).

Decision quality concepts permit the assurance of both effectiveness and efficiency in analyzing decision problems.Ronald A. Howard, \\"Decision Analysis: Practice and Promise\\", Management Science, Vol. 34, No.6, June 1988 In that sense, decision quality can be seen as an extension to decision analysis. Decision quality also describes the process that leads to a high-quality decision. Properly implemented, the DQ process enables capturing maximum value in uncertain and complex scenarios.Larry Neal and Carl Spetzler, \\"An Organization-Wide Approach to Good Decision Making\\", Harvard Business Review, May 27, 2015  Decision and outcome  Fundamental to all decision quality concepts is the distinction between the decision and its outcome. They are different because of the uncertainties when making a choice‚Äîa high quality decision can still result in a poor outcome, and vice versa. In the face of uncertainty, the decision maker only has control over the decision, but no control over the outcome of external circumstances. Consequently, the outcome of a decision does not allow an assessment about its quality. A decision has quality at the time it is made, which is not changed by hindsight. Concepts of decision quality focus on measuring and improving the quality of the decision at the time it is being made.  Elements  The confidence a decision maker has in its choice, and related to it the commitment a decision maker has to act upon that choice, depends on the quality of the decision at the time of making the decision. A high-quality decision is characterized by the following elements: * A useful frame * Feasible and diverse alternatives * Meaningful and reliable information * Clear values, preferences, and trade-offs * Logically sound reasoning * Commitment to action Quality in decision making requires quality in each of the elements listed above, and the overall quality of the decision is limited by the weakest element. Decision quality is achieved when for each element the cost to obtain additional information or insight to improve its quality exceeds the added value. A variety of specific tools and processes exist to improve the quality of each element. = Framing = The first element to achieve decision quality is framing. Having the appropriate frame ensures the right decision problem is addressed. Quality in framing is achieved when the decision makers have alignment on purpose, perspective, and scope of the decision problem to be solved. It means the right people will work the right problem the right way. = Options = A decision cannot be better than the best available alternative (or option if there is more than one). A wide variety of approaches, tools, and methods exist to generate high quality options, ranging from systematic search approaches to identify options to approaches that aim to creatively synthesize options. Quality in options is achieved by applying a suitable options generation process, where the process itself leads to a variety of feasible and diverse options, which are hybrid solutions of originally considered options that combine their best features, and where for each options an understanding of its implementation exists. = Information = The quality of a decision depends on the quality of the information to inform the decision. Quality in information is achieved when the information is meaningful and reliable, is based on appropriate data and judgment, reflects properly all uncertainties, biases, intangibles, and interdependencies, and the limits to the information are known. A wide variety of tools exist to improve the quality of the information used in the decision problem. = Values and trade-offs = Quality in this element requires the identification of the right decision criteria and the definition of trade-off rules among them. This necessitates at first the identification of all key stakeholders, and what each of them values. Quality in this element of decision quality is characterized by transparent value metrics, a clear line of sight of the primary metric, and explicit trade-off rules between key metrics. = Sound reasoning = This element is the domain of decision analysis, which aims to produce insight. Decision analysis provides the logic and analytic tools to find the best choice in a complex situation, and should serve as a guide to facilitate the conversation about the decision. A wide variety of tools, ranging from decisions trees, over hierarchies to complex network models is available to match the decision problem. Quality in this element is achieved when the value and uncertainty of each alternative is understood, and the best choice is clear. = Commitment to action = The quality of a decision also depends on the commitment to act upon the choice that is made. Quality in this element is achieved by involving all key decision makers and stakeholders in an effective and efficient decision making process. At the end of the process, quality is characterized by buy-in across all stakeholders and an organization that is ready to take action and commit resources.  History and industry implementation  Decision quality concepts were first developed in 1964, building on developments in statistical decision theory and game theory by Professor Howard Raiffa of Harvard University, and dynamic probabilistic systems by Professor Ronald A. Howard of Stanford University. First implementation of DA/DQ concepts in a professional application is documented in Prof. Howard's paper \\"Decision Analysis: Applied Decision Theory.\\" published in 1966.Decision Analysis: Applied Decision Theory, Ronald A. Howard., The Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Operational Research, ed. D. B. Hertz and J. Melese. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1966. Since then, decision analysis tools and decision quality concepts have been adopted by many corporations to guide and improve their decisions.Strategic Decision Group, \\"Embedding Decision Quality in Chevron‚Äôs Culture Helps Them Outperform the Competition\\", date missing Starting in 2014, the Society of Decision Professionals is recognizing organizations that made DQ a core competency across the entire organization with the Raiffa-Howard Award, presented annually.Society of Decision Professionals, \\"The Raiffa-Howard Award for Organizational Decision Quality\\", 2014 Beyond organization-wide implementation, decision quality concepts can also be applied on multi-company projects.SPE Technical Report, \\"Guidance for Decision Quality for Multi-Company Upstream Projects\\", SPE-181246-TR, March 2016 See also *Decision analysis *Decision engineering *Decision model *Decision theory *Decision tree *Decision support *Influence diagram References External links * Society of Decision Professionals, the professional society supporting decision professionals as the advisors of choice when facing important, complex decisions. * Decision Analysis, a journal of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences * Decision Analysis Affinity Group, DAAG, has merged with and become the annual conference of the Society of Decision Professionals.

It was founded according to the bards in 1068 (Samvat 1124) by Chudasama Anand or Anant who built the large temple to Mahadev there, calling it Ananteshvar now corrupted to Anteshvar. Anandpur became waste in about 1264 (S. 1320). It was repopulated by the Kathis so late as 1608. During Indian Rebellion of 1857, the temple rooms were used as hiding place. They are now known as the 'Brahmachari's Residence'. The temple was renovated by Kathis in 1857. Anandpur is situated in the Thanga range of hills, some of which exceed a thousand feet in height.

In 1993 added a hexagonal baptistery in the nave to the east, the sacristy expanded in 2002, and the exterior was improved with gardens, trees and statues of St. Peter and St. Paul in the west and east of St. Ann. In December 2004, the cathedral was dedicated to Christ the King.

Text The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 23 verses. =Textual versions= Some early witnesses for the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes the Aleppo Codex (10th century) and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Some fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, i.e., 2Q16 (2QRutha; ~50 CE) with extant verses 13‚Äë23,Dead sea scrolls - Ruth with only slight variations from the Masoretic Text. There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century). Verse 1 : There was a relative of Naomi‚Äôs husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of Elimelech. His name was Boaz. NKJV * \\"A relative of Naomi's husband (KJV: \\"a kinsman of her husband's\\": from the Ketiv reading ◊û÷∞◊ô÷ª◊ì÷∑÷º◊¢ (; absolute ◊û÷∞◊ô÷ª◊ì÷∏◊¢) which is much preferred than the Qere ◊û◊ï◊ì÷∑◊¢, although ◊û÷∞◊ô÷ª◊ì÷∏÷º◊¢ is ambiguous with primary meaning \\"known, well-known, acquainted\\", i.e., an \\"acquaintance\\" (see ; ; ). Such \\"intimate acquaintances\\" are usually among the members of the family clan ('kinsfolk'), the word here may be used in reference to a 'kinsman'. The Vulgate translates it consanguineus which is interpretatively correct. With the original term being less definite, the appended clause, \\"of the family or clan of Elimelech,\\" is not quite redundant.Joseph S. Exell; Henry Donald Maurice Spence-Jones (Editors). The Pulpit Commentary. 23 volumes. First publication: 1890. The \\"next kinsman\\" of Ruth 2:20, etc. ◊í◊ê◊ú gƒÅ'al, is a completely different word. A tradition states that Boaz's father was Elimelech's brother. * \\"A man of great wealth\\" (KJV: \\"a mighty man of wealth\\"): also of great power and authority, as well as of great virtue and honor, all which the word \\"wealth\\" may signify; also the Targumist gives a paraphrase that \\"he was mighty in the law\\"; in the Scriptures, a religious man, which indicates his admirable character. * \\"Boaz\\": Commonly taken to mean, \\"strength is in him\\" (compare ).Barnes, Albert. Notes on the Old Testament. London, Blackie & Son, 1884. Reprint, Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1998. Also the name of one of the pillars in Solomon's temple, indicating its \\"strength\\". Boaz was a grandson of Nahshon, the leader of the tribe of Judah during the Exodus, who first offered at the dedication of the altar, , and his father was Salmon, while his mother was Rahab, the harlot of Jericho (Matthew 1:5). A somewhat detailed account of Boaz is presented, because he, with Ruth, makes the principal part of the subsequent narratives. There is a Jewish tradition considering him the same with Ibzan, a judge of Israel ().John Gill. John Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible. Exposition of the Old and New Testament. Published in 1746-1763. Verse 2 \\"The Gleaners\\", a Bible illustration by Gustave Dor√© (1832‚Äì1883). : So Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, \\"Please let me go to the field, and glean heads of grain after him in whose sight I may find favor.\\" : And she said to her, \\"Go, my daughter.\\" NKJV * \\"Ruth the Moabitess\\": the repetitive designation \\"the Moabitess\\" for Ruth indicates the particularization of this legal phraseology. Despite noted as a foreigner, Ruth was willing and wishful to be accept an Israelitish grace for the poor, the privilege of gleaning after the reapers in the harvest-fields (see ; ; ). Such gleaning could have been a humiliation to those who had been in good life, but Ruth saw the serious difficulty in survival of her mother-in-law, so despite the possible temptation as well as humiliation, she resolved to work during the whole harvest season to gather their own food as much as possible to support their life. * \\"Let me now go to the field\\": After some time at Bethlehem, not long into the barley harvest, before it was over, Ruth asked Naomi permission to go to the field, as she did not choose to do anything without her advice and consent. She desired to go to the field which belonged to Bethlehem, which seems to have been an open field, not enclosed, where each inhabitant had his part, including Boaz, (Ruth 2:3) and it being harvest time the field was full of people. * \\"Glean\\": The right of gleaning was given according to a positive law on the widow, the poor, and the stranger ( and ). However, the liberty to glean behind the reapers (Ruth 2:3) was not a right that could be claimed; it was a privilege granted or refused according to the owner's good will or favor.Robert Jamieson, Andrew Robert Fausset; David Brown. Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown's Commentary On the Whole Bible. 1871. Verse 3 : Then she left, and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. NKJV *\\"Then she left, and went\\" (KJV: \\"And she went, and came\\"): That is, she went out of the house, then went out of the city, and came into the field, while, according to the Midrash,Midrash Ruth, fol. 31. 4. Vid.

By Jim Padgett for Sweet Media (1984). : So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz, to glean until the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law. NKJV * \\"So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz\\" (KJV: \\"So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean\\"): or \\"And she kept close by Boaz's young women to glean\\". Wright translates thus: \\"And she kept gleaning along with the maidens of Boaz.\\" The maidens of Boaz are not represented as gleaning, but the statement of the verse is to be connected to the hortatory statement of verse 8: \\"Keep close to my young women.\\" * \\"Till the end of the barley-harvest and the wheat-harvest\\": the Midrash notes a period of 3 months from the beginning of the barley harvest, to the end of the wheat harvest, though it could be sooner; thus from the Passover to Pentecost were seven weeks, which was the difference between the beginning of one harvest, and the beginning of the other.Midrash Ruth, fol. 33. so Alshech in loc. * \\"Dwelt with her mother-in-law\\": The Vulgate combines this clause with the next verse, and renders it, \\"After she returned to her mother-in-law,\\" pointing the verb thus ◊ï÷∑◊™÷∏÷º◊©÷∏◊Å◊ë instead of ◊ï÷∑◊™÷µ÷º◊©÷∂◊Å◊ë. The same translation of the verb is rendered by Luther and Coverdale. There is no evidence that Ruth slept anywhere else than under her mother-in-law's roof. The clause was apparently written to emphasize Ruth's stainless innocence, sweet simplicity, and never-tiring devotion to her mother-in-law.

History  Boxeur Des Rues literally means \\"street fighting boxer\\". The brand is inspired by the world of Savate, the French boxing born by the fusion of traditional western boxing techniques and oriental Martial arts, that was learned by French sailors returning from the various ports of Far East and Southeast Asia at the beginning of the 19th century. Subsequently, these techniques merged with each other, evolving and beginning to be used in frequent street raids. Later in Marseille, the most important and toughest European port, numerous illegal combat circles (the \\"Fight Clubs\\") were born with a large round of betting around them. From here the name \\"Boxeur Des Rues\\": true sportsmen, born and raised on the streets. The brand is actually an expression of the fusion of \\"streetwear\\" and \\"sportswear\\".

It first flew in 1936 and appeared at the Paris Aero Salon that year. Design The V-10 was a single bay biplane with wings of almost equal span but extreme stagger, so that the upper trailing edge was almost exactly above the lower leading edge in level light. This arrangement owed something to the Darmstadt D-18 (1929) and D-22 biplanes, though the Volland's wings were conventionally braced and not cantilevers; its single, streamlined interplane struts leant forward at about 50¬∞ to the horizontal. The upper wing had a slightly greater span than the lower but the same chord. It was braced over the fuselage with a triangular cabane. Both wings were essentially rectangular in plan, with blunted tips. They had wooden structures, each with two spars, and were fabric covered apart from the demountable wingtips which were covered in light metal. Ailerons were confined to the lower wing but filled its entire trailing edge. Its rectangular cross- section fuselage was built around four ash longerons joined by spruce frames and plywood covered. It had a six-cylinder, inverted, air-cooled inline Train 6T engine in the nose and there was a large baggage store behind it. There were two open cockpits in tandem, fitted with dual control. The forward one, for a pupil or passenger, was under the trailing edge of the upper wing, which had a central rectangular cut-out to improve access. The rear cockpit was for the pilot or instructor and was fully instrumented. The V-10 had a conventional empennage, with a slightly tapered tailplane mounted at mid- fuselage height and fitted with inset elevators. Its tall, nearly vertical, blunt-topped fin carried a rectangular inset rudder. These rear surfaces had wooden structures and were plywood covered. It had a simple, fixed tailskid undercarriage. Its mainwheels had a track of and were on half axles from the lower longerons. On each side an oleo strut ran rearwards from the wheels to the centre of the fuselage underside. Development Tests of the Volland V-10, temporarily equipped with a R√©gnier two-cylinder R.2 engine, began in April 1936 and the first flight took place on 26 May. Soon afterwards it was equipped with the Train 6T that it was designed for; tests with this engine began in August, lasting until the end of the month.

Cugat is one of the founding members of the graphic art group Grabas. Cugat's work encompasses the solitary everyday world of Edward Hopper, the pictorial reflection of Balthus, and the Cubist idea of composition of Jacques Villon. She has her own world of meanings and has established herself as belonging to that of the Latin American greats.  Early life, education, and career  Cugat was born in Argentina in 1935. Since the end of the 1950s, Cugat has been pursuing a means of self- expression. She began when she was very young, studying at the School of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires. In 1958, she entered the world of the theater, where she made sets, design costumes, and ventured into directing plays and ballets. A trip to Europe a few years later led her to continue her studies at the School of Fine Arts. While there, she apprenticed under and learned a great deal from renowned Argentine artist, Horatio Butler. Later, for two years, she worked in the Studios of the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro. In the 1970s she returned to Buenos Aires and with three other artists, Pablo Obelar, Daniel Zelaya and Sergio Camporeale, founded the Grabas Group. As a graphic arts group, the Grabas group had full access to a printmaking workshop in Buenos Aires, which allowed them to explore a broad range of printmaking media, including etching, lithography, and silkscreen. The Grabas group was active in printmaking presentations at universities and workshops throughout South America, with a particular focus on Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela. Eventually, the group moved to Paris to seek fame and fortune. As a member of the Grabas Group, which revolutionized the concept of graphic work, Cugat is considered one of the pioneering artists of Latin America. In her painting, from 1990, Turbulences Argentinean School, Delia Expresses the turbulence felt while studying at art school. Here she has painted, using quick painterly brush strokes, a swirling dreamscape with an image of a girl dressed in her night gown, in the act of running through her dream, but somehow unable to escape from the wheel. The essence of her art lies in the structure of composition with its patient brushstrokes, which seek out a sensitive world of modeled tones and structured masses. The action appears invented, fictitious, created merely to give an existence to the image, in a kind of sentimental projection on a specially structured landscape. It is on the basis of this fictitious fabric, the confluence of surfaces, directions, and characters that Cugat manages to liberate the plastic elements of her art.  Work  Cugat's body of work has transitioned significantly from her early years in Argentina till now. Very early on, she used mixed graphic media as a way to express her memories or the feelings associated with them. Her work at this time was structured with very few elements as not to distract from the overall message. A good example of this, stylistic simplicity, is her piece entitled Las Moradas from 1973. In the early 1980s, after moving to Paris France, Cugat began to work primarily in oil. The works created around this period were muted in tone, mostly shades of tan and gray, and depicted quiet reflective scenes. One such work, Desde el Mirador, from 1980, depicts a man in the background, back to the viewer, looking out, as the title suggests, at a sort of picturesque viewing area. The scene is dominated by architectural features that separate the viewer from the figure. The painting has a sense of melancholy that will come to define Cugat's work in years to come. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, her work began to incorporate bold and vibrant color schemes. She would continue to utilize vibrant color for the rest of her career. In addition, she began to fracture her paintings in a cubistic fashion and began to make use of looser brushwork. A good example of these new found techniques is a work from 1991 entitled L'adiau. In this piece Cugat depicts a memory of travel and combines it with a feeling of separation. Two figures dominate this scene, they seem to be say goodbye to one another but are far removed from each other, effectively highlighting both the sadness of separation and the feeling of ambiguity.  Acclaim   Personal influence  The following is a direct quote from Cugat concerning her personal perspective and the relative influences in and on her work:  Selected solo exhibitions  1995 Habitante Gallery, Panama, Panama 1994 The Americas Collection, Coral Gables, Florida, U.S.A. 1993 Habitante Gallery, Panama, Panama 1992 Cultural Salon of Avianca, Bogota, Colombia 1991 Francony Gallery, Paris, France 1988 Arte Autopista Gallery, Medellin, Colombia 1986 Ruta Correa Gallery, Freiburg, Germany 1985 Dana Ravel Gallery, Austin, Texas, U.S.A 1984 Mary Ann Martin Fine Art, New York, New York, U.S.A Del Reino Gallery, Buenos Aires, Argentina 1983 Galer√≠a Garc√©s Vel√°squez, Bogota, Colombia 1981 Gisele Linder Gallery, Basel, Switzerland 1979 Giannini Gallery, La coru√±a, Spain Gallery Kandinsky, Madrid, Spain 1977 Krief-Raymond, Paris, France Gian Ferrari, Milan, Italy Selected group exhibitions 1995 Espacio Gallery, San Salvador, El Salvador 1994 4th Art Biennial, Cuenca, Ecuador 1991 Francony Gallery, Chicago, Illinois 1990 Francony Gallery, Paris, France 1988 Ruta Corre Gallery, Freiburg, Germany 1985 Kornfeld Gallery, Berna, Switzerland Del Estoril Art Gallery, Lisboa, Portugal Galerie Artcurial, Paris, France  Museum exhibitions and collections  * Nacional Museum, Bogota, Colombia * La Tertulia Museum, Cali, Colombia * Monterrey Museum, Monterrey, Mexico; Art Museum of the Americas, Washington D.C. * National Museum of Fine Arts, Buenos Aires, Argentina * Contemporary Art Museum, Pereira, Colombia * Contemporary Art Museum, Caracas, Venezuela * Collection Barbara Duncan, University of Texas, Austin, U.S.A.

It was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1998. Closed during rainy season. Pass is required to visit which is issued by Forest Department Office, Sec-19B, Chandigarh. Area and location The Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected wildlife sanctuary. It is just 2 kilometers from the Sukhna Lake. It has been spread over an area of 26 square kilometres ( 2600 hectares ) of forest land spanning the plains at the foot of the Shivalik Hills. The rain-fed catchment region of the Sukhna Lake partly falls in the area designated for the Wildlife Sanctuary. History History The history of the Sukhna Lake and the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary is intertwined. The Sukhna Lake was part of the development plans of the city of Chandigarh and was planned and built from 1958, through the sixties and seventies. It was an artificial lake that was fed with rain water from the catchment areas in the Shivalik Hills. Siltation was a big problem for the Sukhna Lake that had to be tackled and it was minimized by many engineering and soil conservation methods. A large scale afforestation program was taken up in the catchment area. Flora and fauna Although the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary was formally declared as a protected wildlife sanctuary in March 1998 yet this semi hilly area was already under adequate forest cover. After 1998 more systematic and a large scale afforestation program was taken up in the catchment areas that resulted in a further better forest cover developed in the catchment area. The deep forest area that grew in size over five decades became the home to a large variety of animals and plants. This forest was then designated as a protected sanctuary; Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary has a rich variety of flora and fauna. It is known to have the most number of sambar found in a group or cluster than anywhere else in the country.

Rodriguez grew up in Marfa, Texas and moved to San Francisco to later pursue an art degree at Merritt College and this is where she learned about the Mexican American Liberation Art Front (MALA-F) and the Chicano movement. In 1970, Patricia received a scholarship to the San Francisco Art Institute and this is where she met Graciela Carrillo. Together, they created and founded the Mujeres Muralistas, the first Chicana women's mural collective in San Francisco.  Early life  Patricia Rodriguez was born in Marfa, Texas in 1944. She was born to a Chicana single parent and was raised by her grandmother while her mother worked. Her grandmother played a major role in the development of a feminine identification. Rodriguez grew her creative identity by attending jamaycas (festive days) which provided an acceptable method of feminine creativity. Later, Patricia and her family moved to California and this helped Patricia learn a new sense about cultural boundaries. Back in Texas, Patricia wouldn't hang out with Anglos unless they were poor or were from the same neighborhood, but in California, there wasn't a division and they hung out together. In junior high, Rodriguez began to formulate herself as an artist. She had an art teacher that encouraged her to become an artist and to go to college. The limitations and social attitudes were an obstacle for Patricia's future, but she relied on her endurance and perseverance.  Education  Rodriguez began to pursue an art degree at Merritt College in 1966 where she discovered the Chicano movements. In 1970, she received a scholarship and attended the San Francisco Art Institute. She found art school to be isolating and chaotic and it wasn't what she expected. Patricia was happy and excited to be accepted to such a prestigious art school but she didn't want to be a minimalist painter at the time like everyone else. She wanted to paint with a lot of color. She joined Chicano movement groups to fight for their right for higher education and through this momentum, she developed herself more as an artist. Her support was restricted by the political expectations of her male counterparts. While attending San Francisco Art Institute, Rodriguez met and roomed with Graciela Carrillo where they rented an apartment on Balmy Alley. Balmy Alley is home to the most concentrated collection of murals in the city of San Francisco. Patricia started to study Mexican muralists and became inspired to create a women's artist group. Patricia and Graciela created Las Mujeres Muralistas (The Women Muralists) in 1974. They added more members to their group: Consuelo Mendez, a Venezuelan born artist in the printmaking program and Irene Perez, a Chicana graphic artist.  Las Mujeres Muralistas  The Bay Area was an important epicenter for student movement groups in the early 70s but for the Mujeres Muralistas, it was a frustrating time. They were the only Latinas at the Art Institute and they lacked support and role models. Las Mujeres Muralistas began to talk about art and the roles it played in each other's lives. The women were aware of the muralist movements beginning in San Francisco but were never invited to participate in projects because of the male exclusivity. Murals began to show up on Balmy Alley, where Rodriguez and Carrillo's apartment was. So in 1973, Patricia and Graciela initiated their own mural on a garage across from their apartment. Since they didn't have money to spend, they got scaffolding from the Arts Commission and the paint was donated by the neighbors. The response was overwhelmingly positive even though there were those who told them to quit. Later that year, Irene Perez painted her own mural on Balmy Alley. She wanted her mural to make a statement against the political imagery shown in the majority of the other murals in the Mission District. This expanded version of political art that included nature, culture, and family characterized the work of Las Mujeres Muralistas. In 1973, Rodriguez was asked to paint a mural at the James Town Community Center for children in San Francisco's Latino Mission district. Rodriguez approached Consuelo Mendez to help collaborate on the mural. As the group became more publicized and recognized, they inspired and recruited more members to their group. These women include: Ester Hernandez, Miriam Olivo, Ruth Rodriguez, and Susan Cervantez. Significant for Las Mujeres Muralistas was their open challenge to paint murals outdoors and in public. Male Chicano artists supported their work, but the men passing by often harassed them while passing the worksite. Also in 1973, Mendez was commissioned to make a mural for the Mission Model Cities building. She enlisted Rodriguez, Carrillo, and Perez to help her. For the first time, they had a small budget. They agreed that the mural should be very colorful and should send a positive message about Latino culture. Each focused on different concepts and Patricia focused on imagery from Bolivia and Peru. They had to share the space effectively and they worked together to create this 20x75 foot mural. The mural was a tribute to the culture of Latin America referencing many countries. Even before the mural was completed, it was received the community's and media's attention. People from around the area would come to look at it and everyone was shocked to learn that the muralists were women. The mural became well known and it helped the Mujeres Muralistas to be taken more seriously. With the finished mural called Latinoamerica, this would be the first and last time the core group of Carrillo, Mendez, Perez, and Rodriguez would work on a mural together. Other murals would only be worked on but only by a few of the members. Las Mujeres Muralistas helped develop a reputation for Latin American artists and they hold a significant place in Chicano art history. = Latinoamerica = Latinoamerica is a mural created by the Mujeres Muralistas which included Patricia Rodriguez, Graciela Carrillo, Consuelo Mendez, and Irene Perez. Latinoamerica, created and completed in 1974, is the first mural created for the public by the Mujeres Muralistas and it is considered their most popular. The mural is located in San Francisco on Mission and 25th street. Latinoamerica was Rodriguez‚Äôs way to introduce the Mujeres Muralistas to the community as muralists. Rodriguez and the rest of the women in the Mujeres Muralistas painted murals like Latinoamerica in sections to allow all of them to express their experiences and perspectives. Latinoamerica represents different aspects of the Latinx community that came from the members of the Mujeres Muralistas; conventional images from Bolivia and Peru by Rodriguez, imagery from Venezuela and family by Mendez, Aztec heritage by Carrillo, and cornstalk and magueys by Perez. The mural depicts, from left to right, llamas native to the Andes in South America, Peruvian pipe players, Yare devils from Venezuela, a family inside an Indian sun, a tuiuiu bird from Brazil, a Bolivian diablada figure, and an Aztecan fifth sun shining over a princess and warrior figure, all framed by cornstalk. The mural is inclusive to the residents of the community by representing different countries that the residents have a special connection to such as Mexico, Bolivia, Venezuela, Peru, Brazil, and Guatemala. The mural represents people (especially women and children), landscape, and cultural traditions from Latin America. Latinoamerica is describe as an ‚Äúode to life‚Äù because it combines the spiritual, human, natural dimension of the different cultures from the people of the Mission District (the community of the Mujeres Muralistas). Rodriguez and the rest of the Mujeres Muralistas used Latinoamerica to acknowledge and represent themselves and the people in their Chicanx/Latinx community, especially the women whom are underrepresented.  Career after Las Mujeres Muralistas  In 1975, Patricia was invited to teach at the University of California ‚Äì Berkeley in the Chicano Studies Department. She was the first Chicana artist to teach in the UC system and she created the first Chicano Art History course at UC Berkeley. Rodriguez taught at various universities and colleges in the Bay Area. In the 1980s, Patricia created a large body of art box constructions for exhibitions that traveled all over the U.S. and abroad. In 1990, Rodriguez was invited to teach at the Institute for American Indian Arts in Sante Fe, New Mexico as a printmaker. After teaching for a year, she fell in love with New Mexico and stayed for six years. She taught at UNM-Los Alamos part-time and had a full-time job as a student advisor. Patricia also taught at the Espanola Community college in New Mexico where she painted murals with the youth. In 1997, Rodriguez moved back to California to teach at California State University Monterey Bay and in 1998, she started classes at San Francisco State University for her Master of Fine Arts (MFA) credits. From 2001-2009, Rodriguez began to work as a gallery coordinator as the Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts in San Francisco. She helped artists from abroad exhibit their works in the gallery where she was a curator. Patricia is currently part-time retired but still continues to work with youth in a screen printing teaching position and Laney College in Oakland, California. She also enjoys writing articles about the art experiences she has had in her life.

For example, in a 2015 study, he found that laws prohibiting open carrying of guns in Oklahoma and California reduced suicide rates in the year after each was passed. In 2017, he led another study showing that suicide rates declined in states with universal background check and waiting period laws compared to states without such laws. He has also co-authored research showing that military personnel who have undergone basic training have more suicide capability than those who have not, in line with his belief that impulsivity and capability are both important to the risk of completed suicide.

The type dentary was originally included in the hypodigm of Coelodontognathus donensis named by the notable Russian vertebrate paleontologist Vitaliy Georgiyevich Ochev in 1967. Ivakhnenko (1973) separated the specimen and gave it its own genus and species name in light of the new material, which he named in honor of Ochev. The dentaries of Vitalia were collected at the Donskaya Luka Locality near the village of Sirotinskaya in Ilovlinsky District, Volgograd Oblast, from the Lipovskaya Formation of the Gamskii Horizon. Like Coelodontognathus, Vitalia was originally described as a procolophonid parareptile in 1973, but Arkhangelskii & Sennikov (2008) reclassified the taxon as a possible trilophosaurid archosauromorph. Vitalia is thought to be similar to the possible trilophosaurids Coelodontognathus and Doniceps, both of which are known exclusively from the same locality. Coelodontognathus and Vitalia are similar to procolophonids in that they have wide teeth but differs from them in that they have tooth roots set deep into the jaws.

History Loma Khuman of Kherdi State resided here for some time when Noghanji Gohil was ruling at Gariadhar. Khimo Chandsir, also a Kathi, was at this time Noghanji's minister. As he was a distant connection of Loma Khuman's that chieftain invited him one day to Ansodar. While there he said to him that as vegetables abounded at Gariadhar, Noghanji should send him some. Khimo replied proudly that Noghanji was not a greengrocer that he should supply Loma with vegetables, Loma angrily rejoined that he would send his horsemen both to take the vegetable and also lift the cattle. To this Khimo answered that when Lotna's horsemen should come he would endeavour to give them a fitting reception. Some days afterwards, Loma sent two hundred chosen horse, who both ravaged the gardens of Gariadhar and drove off the cattle. Noghanji Gohil fled to Dhunoji at Sihor, and Loma Khuman occupied the town of Gariadhar, and placed his son Kanthad Khuman there at the head of a strong force. In the meantime he prepared to attack Dhunoji. The armies gave battle near the village of Valavad, and Dhunoji, after fighting bravely, was slain. Loma Khuman now himself returned to Kherdi, where his uncle Nagpal Khuman was ruling. During his absence Noghanji, with the aid of the Baria Kolis and that of Akherajji of Sihor, obtained an entrance by treachery in the town of Gariadhar, and recovered it. putting Kanthad Khuman, son of Loma, to death. Loma made many forays against Gariadhar aud did it much injury, but never succeeded in retaking it. Finally, Noghanji Gohil made peace with Loma through the intervention of Charan Mokabhai, and they drank opium together in token of amity. On this occasion Noghanji bestowed Ranigam on Loma Khuman in compensation for the death of his son Kanthad, and the Khumans held Ranigam during the British period. Loma Khuman had a feud with Navanagar State, which is said to have first arisen when he accompanied Amin Khan Ghori and Kunvar Ajoji in pursuit of Mirza Khan to Kodinar. On this occasion he took an elephant and refused to surrender it to Jasa Ladhak, minister of Jam Sataji. Afterwards, when he had accompanied Sultan Muzafar to Ahmadabad, Jasa Ladhak laid Kherdi waste, and carried off the elephant. Loma Khuman concealed his anger, but afterwards by deserting the Jam on the field of Bhuchar Mori, caused him to be defeated, and Jasa Ladhak and Kunvar Ajoji to lose their lives. After this the enmity between Loma Khuman and Navanagar was very bitter, and Loma Khuman led forays up to the very gates of Navanagar. On one occasion he was met by Jam Jasaji and his nephew Lakhoji and a cadet named Sartanji at the head of their army, on the banks of the Rangmati river close to Navanagar. The Jam called on Loma to flee, but Loma refused, and immediately gave the order to charge. The Jam was worsted and forced to retire into the town, but Sartanji was slain and Lakhoji's horse killed under him. The Jam being entirely unable to kill or capture Loma Khuman, at last treacherously invited him to Navanagar, and then seizing him, put him to death. There is a piece of bardic poetry regarding this, as follows: The Gujarati poetry is as follows: Ansodar afterwards belonged to the Kundla Khumans of Savarkundla, and was conquered by Vakhatsinghji of Bhavnagar State, together with the Kundla pargana. It was then conquered by Kumpa Vala of Chital, but ceded back again to Bhavnagar, together with Saldi, in about 1797.

Viteri began her career with printmaking and installations and then turned to digital arts later on the mid-to-late 1990s. Education and career In 1968, Alicia Viteri was a college student at the Centro Colombia-Norte Americano in Bogota, Colombia, where she participated in her very first group exhibition as an artist. In 1970, she was a proud graduate from the School of Fine Arts at the Universidad de los Andres, also in Bogota, Colombia. In 1972, Viteri moved to Panama, where she had her very first solo exhibition. Within the same year, she began working as a professor at the University of Panama for a printmaking course. For a very short time, Viteri lived and worked in Ecuador from 1977-78. Exhibition and works 1970-76 was a period of intense pictorial activity and participation in local and international exhibitions and biennials. One of Viteri's first artistic activities was in 1970 with the Young Artists Biennia at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Bogota, Colombia. Three years later, she participated in the Second Graphic Arts Biennial in Cali, Colombia and then later, her work was featured in the Casa de la Cultura (House of Culture) in Quito, Ecuador. Viteri's art incorporates many types of media, including drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, fabric, book making, and even audio for her famous installation/mural titled Pictorial Space (held on a 7m x 2.7m fabric surface). Viteri's work displays an interest in insects and she developed a powerful passion for observing them at the Printmaking Workshop at the Universidad de los Andres, under the supervision of Umberto Giangrandi and the knowing gaze of Juan Antonio Roda. Later on in Viteri's artwork, these beetles, ants and flies slowly become humanized, which is taken to represent an examination of the inner self. She got rid of wings and insect-like limbs and joined carnivals and funerals as men and women of extravagant features and expressions walked through canvases to finally congregate in the large mural Pictorial Space. Alicia Viteri specialized in lithography at the Blau Workshop in Formentara, Spain in 1983. Within the same year, Viteri worked on creating her new work, Pictorial Spaces, a 7‚Äôx3‚Äô mural, the first example of installation art in Panama. This mural is an exhibit of artwork presented at the Centro Colombo Americano in Bogota, Colombia and has traveled to many locations around the world such as the Intar Gallery in New York, the Hispanic At Center in New York, the Galeria of Quito, the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo in Panama City, La Tertulia Museum in Cali, and the Banco de la Republica in Pasto. The mural includes six panels executed in oil on canvas, in black, white, silver, and gold showing a theme of carnivals and funerals. Some of the color palette includes colors red, pink, yellow, and orange that Viteri chose to be projected onto the panels with figures of people. At the time, installation work was still a newly-explored medium in Panama. An early example is the work of Miguel Angels Rojas, who began to explore the medium at the end of the 1970s in the Atenas Salon and the project room at the Museum of Modern Art in Bogota, Colombia. Viteri's work also uses recordings of urban noise with music and lighting. The exhibition includes the primary drafts for the mural, along with the series of drawings and prints of insects and the series entitled The Mummy. Her artwork examines the relationship between her inner world and the transposition of human perception in profane concepts. Accomplishments * In 1979, Viteri founded the Printmaking Workshop at the Panamanian Institute of Art, where she was responsible for revitalizing an interest in printmaking as an artistic medium in Panama. She retired from this position in 1983. * During her years of teaching at the Panamanian Institute of Art, Alicia planned and carried out the project ‚ÄúEleven Prints,‚Äù a portfolio with works by the best Panamanian artist of that time. * In 1981, she directed the graphic series Panarte Editions. In 1984, Viteri was part of a graphic design club portfolio printed at Prografica, and the portfolio of the Religious Music Festival in Popayan, both in Colombia. Publications Alicia Viteri's book Memoria Digital/Digital Memory was published in 2000, where she uses the technique of computer art and recreated digital photography of her family and friends, recounting her life through images and brief legends. In 2009, it won second place for Best Arts Book in the Spanish/Bilingual category of the 11th Annual International Latino Book Awards. The landscape she has been working on since sometime ago became a parallel production that allows her to approach color and to leave behind the black- and- white world of her insects, carnivals, and funerals while deepening her mastery of the craft of painting. They are bright, full-of-life photos of her family and friends, mixed with digital design. In the middle of her new project, Viteri became very ill and while overcoming all obstacles with great tenacity, and with the support of Benjamin Villegas, the book project moved forward and came to life. The project was finished and launched in March 2009 in Panama City, and in mid-April in Bogota at the Gabriel Garcia Marquez Cultural Center. Alicia Viteri created these pieces of artwork by putting her pictorial and graphic expertise to the limit by using the services provided by technology. She used computer software to replace brushes, burins, and the sharp point of a pencil. The format of the book features a violet silk cover and the image of Alicia as a child, which turns into a delicate object. A translucent-paper sheet precedes it as if one was looking through a photo- album.

Mutal is well known for her hand carved stonework, which focuses on the interconnectedness of the human and non-human world. The idea of duality is an omnipresent theme in Mutal‚Äôs life, as she is of European heritage, but she lives part-time in the ancient landscape of Lima, Peru and part-time in the modern architecture of New York City. Duality manifests in her work as she juxtaposes rough, jagged edges with smooth, polished surfaces, as well as with the physical structure of the work, has each of the pieces typically as some element that links two independent pieces. Most impressive about her work- is Mutal‚Äôs ability to give a sort of dynamism to the inherently static substance of stone. Mutal‚Äôs work is well represented globally, and her practice is based out of Norha Haime Gallery in New York City.  Early life and education  Lika Mutal was born in the Netherlands in 1939. Her mother was an accomplished pianist and singer, and her father was an oil painter. Mutal was the third child of twelve, and the first girl born in the family. Though her father influenced her love for the arts, Mutal never learned the visual arts, and in fact, she found her father's black and white paintings boring. From a young age, Mutal wished to become an actress. She acted in the cabaret in the Netherlands, and attended Bonifacius College in Utrecht. As she became more skilled, she sought out the traditional theatre school. However, she never attended because she had met the man who would later become her husband. In 1962, Lika married Silvio Mutal. Soon after, in 1964, the two moved to Colombia for Silvio‚Äôs job. Mutal fell in love with Colombia instantly, and found herself intrigued by the effect that the landscape, which was so different from the flat and grey city scape of the Netherlands, had on the human consciousness. Because of the language barrier, Mutal‚Äôs acting dream was put on hold, so she began to puppeteer in order to continue performing. She handmade each of her puppets, which ultimately lead her to pursue sculpture as a career. Her puppets began as representational figures that she used to portray her political opinions, but within time became increasingly abstract until they could hardly be considered puppets anymore, but instead small sculptures. Lika Mutal studied at the Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, Colombia for a short time until she moved with her husband and two children to Lima, Peru in 1968. Mutal was mystified by the untouched landscape of Peru juxtaposed with a growing interest in modern architecture. While in Lima, she began studying at the Universidad Catolica. At the University, she studied under Anna Maccagno, who taught her to work with traditional materials such as clay, wood, and steel. In 1971, Mutal was introduced to a well-known stone smith, Don Juan Arias, who would soon become her greatest influence. Beyond the technicality of the classroom, Arias taught Mutal the importance of developing an intimate relationship with stone, as if it had a soul. He showed her healing qualities found in stone if one takes the time to notice, the very same qualities that are dangerous if not careful. Halfway through the degree at the Universidad Catolica, Mutal quit in order to work on her own, and no evidence points to her ever returning. While still a novice to stonework, Mutal was very cautious of outside artistic influences, and resisted visiting the ancient Incan stonework located in Cuzco, Peru as she feared she may never want to work with stone again. In 1978, she visited Cuzco for the first time. Here she saw that Pre-Columbian art was created to serve a purpose, rather than to be beautiful.  Career and work  After quitting university, Mutal rented a small studio in Barranco, Lima. That same year, she had her first small art show. Two years later, after building her portfolio and collection of work, Mutal was noticed by the Galerie D‚ÄôEendt, in Amsterdam. This show was the tipping point of her career that gained her a great deal of global admiration and led to her next show at the Galerie Daniel Gervis in Paris, France. In 1983, Lika Mutal was invited to become part of the Nahra Haime Gallery in New York. This relationship has continued to the present and as influenced Mutal to take residence in New York City, as well as Peru. Lika Mutal‚Äôs work is heavily inspired by her intimate relationship with the landscape, and with the spirit of the stone. It is these relationships that make her work so unique. From the process of choosing a stone, to the finished product, Mutal‚Äôs goal is to magnify the individual life in the stone, so that it may be seen or experienced by the untrained eye. In order to do this, Mutal adopted a unique standard protocol for her artistic development. She begins by visiting a quarry in order to choose the perfect stone. Mutal is not in search of any specific qualities, she just looks for a stone to stand out to her as an individual. She then studies it physically for some time, leaves, and if she can return to exactly the same stone multiple times days later, she takes the stone to her studio.Castro, Jan Garden. \\"Listening to Stones.\\" Sculpture 31, no. 2 (March 2012): 36-41. Art Full Text (H.W. Wilson), EBSCOhost (accessed February 5, 2016). Before removing the stone, Mutal performs rituals taught to her by incan shamans, which include burnt offerings and sprinkling the ground with wine, asking the Earth for permission. After the stone is in her studio, she spends time analyzing it for its external and internal properties. It is for this reason that she is known for living a stone untouched in her studio for years before she actually makes the first mark. When she finally begins manipulating the stone, she focuses on enhancing rather than altering, and as careful to avoid imposing her human will onto the stone.Kartofel, Graciela. \\"Lika Mutal: Nohra Haime Gallery.\\" Art Nexus no. 37 (August 2000): 136-137. Art Full Text (H.W. Wilson), EBSCOhost (accessed February 5, 2016). It is this enhanced awareness of the stone, and the intricacy of which she works that forces her to work by hand rather than with stone cutting machinery. In addition to being influenced by Mutal‚Äôs personal relationship with the stone, some work is inspired by the quipus, a pre- Columbian tool used for recording and mathematics which has never been deciphered. This simple, inherent mystery revolving the quipus inspired much of Mutal‚Äôs early, smaller scaled, work, which has been praised for having a fibrous fluidity. In addition to the Quipus series, Mutal explored the dual theme of independent interconnectedness through her Ones series. This series speaks to the interconnectedness between human life and nature, by linking two horizontal beams in such a way that they could still move independently. This work is especially inspired by Peru‚Äôs unique landscape. One aspect of the Peruvian landscape that inspires Mutal is the unexpected duality found in ‚Äúthe confrontation with life and death; beautiful beaches, but carcasses of animals on the beach‚Ä¶ at first big an empty, but then charged with subtle energy. Driving on the tiny ribbon that is the road, on one hand the ocean and the desert, and on the other, the strong presence of many colored mountains.‚Äù The concept of independent-interconnectedness in Lika Mutal‚Äôs work evolved through the series of work referred to as the Labyrinths. The Labyrinths are more architectural than the previous work, which is directly correlated with living part-time in New York City, and they serve as the point in her career in which she began to work larger scale, in order to connect her entire body with her practice. In addition to transitioning to large scale work, Lika Mutal also began the transition into working with granite.  Awards and honors  Lika Mutal has recently been awarded the Jose Maria Arguedas Prize for her work El ojo que Llora. This work is located on permanent display in Campo de Marte, in Lima, Peru. Mutal was commissioned to make a piece of public art in order to commemorate the loss of life as a result of a dispute between the Peruvian government and guerilla that took place in 1980-2000. The memorial consists of one large stone, in the center of a spiraling path of over 60,000 small stones. The center stone is a representation of the Pachamama, an Incan Earth Mother goddess. Embedded in the surface is a smaller stone, meant to represent an eye. The large stone also has a water element that constantly trickles water from the eye as if crying. Each of the smaller encircling stones is engraved with a name of an individual who fell victim to the violence. This memorial caused controversy amongst the population over what names what constitutes a victim and who should be memorialize because included in the 60,000 stones were the aggressors who caused the violence. Lika Mutal has also been awarded the Royal Ueno Museum Prize in 1994, and an Excellent Maquette Prize, in 1992, from the Fujisankei Biennale founded in Japan, as well as the First Sculpture Prize from the Universidad Catolica in 1970.

From there, the Novljani and other Serb tribes pushed out the native population towards the Tara and source of Moraƒça, and towards the south, Podgorica, and then settled and divided the conquered lands between themselves. This happened in olden times, surely prior to the 13th century. The Novljani received the wide land that later encompassed the tribes of Banjani and Drobnjaci.

Early life  Carla Rippey was born on May 21, 1950 in Kansas City, Kansas. She is the daughter of James Rippey and Barbara Wright. Her father worked as a photojournalist, and her mother was a scholar of Great Plains Literature and a Ph.D. in English Literature. Rippey was raised in the American Midwest in the states of Kansas, Iowa, and Nebraska. She has a brother and two sisters. After graduating from high school, she moved to Washington, D.C.  Education  Although she drew constantly as a child, as a teenager poetry became her principal means of creative expression. During high school, she visited the Joslyn Art Museum which was located next to her school. It was in Joslyn that she encountered prints for the first time.[1] Rippey worked after school and saved her earnings which allowed her to travel to Paris when she turned 18. She studied at La Sorbonne in Paris. From 1969‚Äì1972, Rippey attended college at the State University of New York at Old Westbury. The university had an experimental program that allowed her to create her own study plan; her senior thesis, written under advisor Uruguayan artist and critic Luis Camnitzer, explored the intersection of art and politics. Rippey spent her last year of college in Boston, studying at the Boston Public Library and working in the women's movement; she helped to establish a women's center and made silkscreen posters for feminist events. She also learned offset printing at the alternative publishing house ‚ÄúThe New England Free Press.‚Äù Throughout her adolescence Rippey had considered herself a poet, but finding herself in a Spanish speaking culture after moving to Chile she was motivated to set writing aside and return to her constant childhood activity of drawing and its variations.[3] In 1972, she became a visiting student at the Universidad de Chile and the Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile, where she learned printmaking while auditing classes. Together with Pascoe she participated in the leftist political group ‚ÄúMovimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria‚Äù or MIR, once again making silk-screened posters. On September 11, 1973, during the coup against Salvador Allende, Rippey and her now husband Pascoe met with MIR militants and were beaten by the military police after receiving an order to disperse. For a period of time, Bolivian exile Julio Rhea and his brother Humberto Rhea Clavijo, Che Guevara's doctor, sheltered the couple in their home. Forced to leave, the couple then moved to Mexico City to Pascoe's family home in Mixcoac. Rippey continued her work in printmaking and started to make woodcuts in the collective studio at the ‚ÄúMolino de Santo Domingo‚Äù in Tacubaya, she also participated in the founding of the literary movement of infrarrealism with Robert Bola√±o, Mario Staniago Papasquiaro, Brono Montan√©, Juan Esteban Harrington and others and became active in the artists‚Äô collective Peyote y la Compa√±√≠a, part of the 70's movement of ‚ÄúLos Grupos‚Äù. In 2013, Rippey was appointed as the first female director of the historic National School of Painting, Sculpture and Printmaking ‚ÄúLa Esmeralda‚Äù, a free government university-level art school in Mexico City. During her tenure she worked with the school to help encourage and promote a collaborative model of education, focusing not only on educating the students to be successful artists but also to be creative members of society.[3] In 2013, Rippey was appointed as the first female director of the historic National School of Painting, Sculpture and Printmaking, La Esmerelda, a government dependent school in Mexico City. She worked with the school to help encourage and promote a ‚Äúcollaborative model of education‚Äù.  Career  In 1976 at the Benjamin Franklin Library of the Anglo-Mexican Cultural Institute, Rippey held her first individual show, Serigraf√≠as, aguafuertes y monotipos. In 1976, her work was used as the cover image for Roberto Bola√±o's first book and she began a long correspondence with the Chilean author. In 1977, Felipe Ehrenberg invited her to join the Groupos de Trabajadores de la Cultura, a collective of leftist cultural organizations. In 1985, Rippey's first exhibition was displayed at the Carrillo Gil Museum in Mexico City. After meeting Adolfo Pati√±o, she joined the experimental art group, Peyote y la Compa√±√≠a. Armando Cristeto, Alberto Perg√≥n, Xavier Quiirarte, √Ångel de la Rueda, Alejandro Arango, and Lola Mu√±oz-Pons were also members. During the 1990s, Rippey's work was exhibited more often.

This results primarily as a consequence of polyandrous mating systems, or due to extra-pair copulations of females, which increases the chance of cuckoldry, in which the male mate raises a child that is not genetically related to him.Simmons, Leigh W.; Firman, Ren√©e C.; Rhodes, Gillian; Peters, Marianne. (2004). ‚ÄúHuman sperm competition: Testis size, sperm production, and rates of extrapair copulations‚Äù. Animal Behaviour. 68 (2): 297-302. Sperm competition among males has resulted in numerous physiological and psychological adaptations, including the relative size of testes, the size of the sperm midpiece, prudent sperm allocation, and behaviors relating to sexual coercion,Martin, Robert D. (2007). ‚ÄúThe evolution of human reproduction: A primatological perspective‚Äù. Yearbook of Physical Anthropology. 50: 59-84. however this is not without consequences: the production of large amounts of sperm is costlyDewsbury, Donald A. (1982). ‚ÄúEjaculate cost and male choice‚Äù. The American Naturalist. 119 (5): 601-610.Baker, R. Robin; Bellis, Mark A. (1993). ‚ÄúHuman sperm competition: Ejaculate adjustment by males and the function of masturbation‚Äù. Animal Behaviour. 46 (5): 861-885. and therefore, researchers have predicted that males will produce larger amounts of semen when there is a perceived or known increase in sperm competition risk. Sperm competition is not exclusive to humans, and has been studied extensively in other primates,M√∏ller, Anders Pape. (1988). ‚ÄúEjaculate quality, testes size and sperm competition in primates‚Äù. Journal of Evolution. 17 (5): 479-488. as well as throughout much of the animal kingdom.Parker, G.A. (1970). ‚ÄúSperm competition and its evolutionary consequences in the insects‚Äù. Biological Reviews. 55 (4): 525-567.Birkhead, T.R.; M√∏ller, A.P. (1992). Sperm competition in birds: Evolutionary causes and consequences. London: Academic Press. .Ginsberg, J.R.; Huck, U.W. (1989). ‚ÄúSperm competition in mammals‚Äù. Trends in Ecology and Evolution. 4 (3): 74-79. The differing rates of sperm competition among other primates indicates that sperm competition is highest in primates with multi-male breeding systems, and lowest in primates with single-male breeding systems. Compared to other animals, and primates in particular, humans show low-to-intermediate levels of sperm competition, suggesting that humans have a history of little selection pressure for sperm competition.  Physiological adaptations to sperm competition  Physiological evidence, including testis size relative to body weight and the volume of sperm in ejaculations, suggests that humans have experienced a low- to-intermediate level of selection pressure for sperm competition in our evolutionary history. Nevertheless, there is a large body of research that explores the physiological adaptations males do have for sperm competition. = Testis size and body weight = Evidence suggests that, among the great apes, relative testis size is associated with the breeding system of each primate species.Harcourt, A.H.; Harvey, P.H.; Larson, S.G.; Short, R.V. (1981). ‚ÄúTestis weight, body weight and breeding system in primates‚Äù. Nature 293: 55-57. In humans, testis size relative to body weight is intermediate between monogamous primates (such as gorillas) and promiscuous primates (such as chimpanzees), indicating an evolutionary history of moderate selection pressures for sperm competition. = Ejaculate volume = The volume of sperm in ejaculates scales proportionately with testis size and, consistent with the intermediate weight of human males testis, ejaculate volume is also intermediate between primates with high and low levels of sperm competition. Human males, like other animals, exhibit prudent sperm allocation, a physiological response to the high cost of sperm production as it relates to the actual or perceived risk of sperm competition at each insemination.Wedell, Nina; Gage, Matthew J.G.; Parker, Geoffrey A. (2002). ‚ÄúSperm competition, male prudence, and sperm-limited females‚Äù. Trends in Ecology and Evolution. 17 (7): 313-320. In situations where the risk of sperm competition is higher, males will allocate more energy to producing higher ejaculate volumes. Studies have found that the volume of sperm does vary between ejaculates,Mallidis, C.; Howard, E.J.; Baker, H.W.G. (2008). ‚ÄúVariation of semen quality in normal men‚Äù. International Journal of Andrology. 14 (2): 99-107. and that sperm produced during copulatory ejaculations are of a higher quality (younger, more motile, etc.) than those sperm produced during masturbatory ejaculates or nocturnal emissions. This suggests that, at least within males, there is evidence of allocation of higher quality sperm production for copulatory purposes. Researchers have suggested that males produce more and higher quality sperm after spending time apart from their partners, implying that males are responding to an increased risk of sperm competition,Baker, R. Robin; Bellis, Mark A. (1989). ‚ÄúNumber of sperm in human ejaculates varies in accordance with sperm competition theory‚Äù. Animal Behaviour. 37: 867-869. although this view has been challenged in recent years. It is also possible that males may be producing larger volumes of sperm in response to actions from their partners, or it may be that males who produce larger volumes of sperm may be more likely to spend more time away from their partners. = Size of sperm midpiece = Diagram of human sperm cell The size of the sperm midpiece is determined in part by the volume of mitochondria in the sperm.Anderson, Matthew J.; Dixson, Alan F. (2002). ‚ÄúSperm competition: Motility and the midpiece in primates‚Äù. Nature. 416 (6880): 496. Sperm midpiece size is tied to sperm competition in that individuals with a larger midpiece will have more mitochondria, and will thus have more highly motile sperm than those with a lower volume of mitochondria. Among humans, as with relative testis size and ejaculate volume, the size of the sperm midpiece is small compared to other primates, and is most similar in size to that of primates with low levels of sperm competition, supporting the theory that humans have had an evolutionary history of intermediate levels of sperm competition. = Penis anatomy = Diagram of human penis Several features of the anatomy of the human penis are proposed to serve as adaptations to sperm competition, including the length of the penis and the shape of the penile head. By weight, the relative penis size of human males is similar to that of chimpanzees, although the overall length of the human penis is the largest among primates.Short, R.V. (1979). ‚ÄúSexual selection and its component parts, somatic and genital selection as illustrated by man and the great apes‚Äù. Advances in the Study of Behavior. 9: 131-158. It has been suggested by some authors that penis size is constrained by the size of the female reproductive tract (which, in turn is likely constrained by the availability of space in the female body), and that longer penises may have an advantage in depositing semen closer to the female cervix.Brown, Luther; Shumaker, Robert W.; Downhower, Jerry F. (1995). ‚ÄúDo primates experience sperm competition?‚Äù The American Naturalist. 146 (2): 302-306. Other studies have suggested that over our evolutionary history, the penis would have been conspicuous without clothing, and may have evolved its increased size due to female preference for longer penises.Mautz, Brian S.; Wong, Bob B.M.; Peters, Richard A.; Jennions, Michael D. (2013). ‚ÄúPenis size interacts with body shape and height to influence male attractiveness‚Äù. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States. 110 (17): 6925-6930. The shape of the glans and coronal ridge of the penis may function to displace semen from rival males, although displacement of semen is only observed when the penis is inserted a minimum of 75% of its length into the vagina.Gallup, Gordon G.; Burch, Rebecca L.; Zappieri, Mary L.; Parvez, Rizwan A.; Stockwell, Malinda L.; Davis, Jennifer A. (2003). ‚ÄúThe human penis as a semen displacement device‚Äù. Evolution and Human Behavior. 24 (4): 277-289. After allegations of female infidelity or separation from their partner, both men and women report that men thrusted the penis more deeply and more quickly into the vagina at the couple's next copulation.  Psychological adaptations to sperm competition  In addition to physiological adaptations to sperm competition, men also have been shown to have psychological adaptations, including certain copulatory behaviors, behaviors relating to sexual coercion, investment in relationships, sexual arousal, performance of oral sex, and mate choice. = Copulatory behaviors = Human males have several physiological adaptations that have evolved in response to pressures from sperm competition, such as the size and shape of the penis. In addition to the anatomy of male sex organs, men have several evolved copulatory behaviors that are proposed to displace rival male semen. For example, males who are at a higher risk of sperm competition (defined as having female partners with high reproductive value, such as being younger and physically attractive) engaged more frequently in semen-displacing behaviors during sexual intercourse than men who were at a lower risk of sperm competition.Goetz, Aaron T.; Shackelford, Todd K.; Weekes-Shackelford, Viviana A.; Euler, Harald A.; Hoier, Sabine; Schmitt, David P.; LaMunyon, Craig W. (2005). ‚ÄúMate retention, semen displacement, and human sperm competition: A preliminary investigation of tactics to prevent and correct female infidelity‚Äù. Personality and Individual Differences. 38 (4): 749-763. These semen-displacing behaviors include deeper and quicker thrusts, increased duration of intercourse, and an increased number of thrusts. = Sexual coercion and relationship investment = Men who are more invested into a relationship have more to lose if their female partner is engaging in extra- pair copulations. This has led to the development of the cuckoldry risk hypothesis, which states that men who are at a higher risk of sperm competition due to female partner infidelity are more likely to sexually coerce their partners through threatening termination of the relationship, making their partners feel obligated to have sex, and other emotional manipulations of their partners, in addition to physically forcing partners to have sex.Goetz, Aaron T.; Shackelford, Todd K. (2009). ‚ÄúSexual coercion in intimate relationships: A comparative analysis of the effects of women‚Äôs infidelity and men‚Äôs dominance and control‚Äù. Archives of Sexual Behavior. 38 (2): 226-234. In forensic cases, it has been found that men who rape their partners experienced cuckoldry risk prior to raping their partners.Camilleri, Joseph A.; Quinsey, Vernon L. (2009). ‚ÄúTesting the cuckoldry risk hypothesis of partner sexual coercion in community and forensic samples‚Äù. Evolutionary Psychology. 7 (2): 164-178. Additionally, men who spend more time away from their partners are not only more likely to sexually coerce their partners, but they are also more likely to report that their partner is more attractive (as well as reporting that other men find her more attractive), in addition to reporting a greater interest in engaging in intercourse with her.Pham, Michael N.; Shackelford, Todd K. (2013). ‚ÄúThe relationship between objective sperm competition risk and men‚Äôs copulatory interest is moderated by partner‚Äôs time spent with other men‚Äù. Human Nature. 24 (4): 476-485. Men who perceive that their female partners spend time with other men also are more likely to report that she is more interested in copulating with him. = Sexual arousal and sexual fantasies = Sperm competition has also been proposed to influence men‚Äôs sexual fantasies and arousal. Some researchers have found that much pornography contains scenarios with high sperm competition, and it is more common to find pornography depicting one woman with multiple men than it is to find pornography depicting one man with multiple women,Pound, Nicholas. (2002). ‚ÄúMale interest in visual cues of sperm competition risk‚Äù. Evolution and Human Behavior. 23 (6): 443-466. although this may be confounded by the fact that it is less expensive to hire male pornographic actors than female actors.Escoffier, Jeffrey. (2007). ‚ÄúPorn star/stripper/escort: Economic and sexual dynamics in a sex work career‚Äù. Journal of Homosexuality. 53: 173-200. Kilgallon and Simmons documented that men produce a higher percentage of motile sperm in their ejaculates after viewing sexually explicit images of two men and one woman (a sperm competition risk) than after viewing sexually explicit images of three women, likely indicating a response to an active risk of sperm competition.Kigallon, Sarah J.; Simmons, Leigh W. (2005). ‚ÄúImage content influences men‚Äôs semen quality‚Äù. Biology Letters. 1 (3): 253-255. = Oral sex = It is unknown whether or not men‚Äôs willingness and desire to perform oral sex on their female partners is an adaptation. Oral sex is not unique to humans,Tan, Min; Jones, Gareth; Zhu, Guangjian; Ye, Jianping; Hong, Tiyu; Zhou, Shanyi; Zhang, Shuyi; Zhang, Libiao.

(2013). ‚ÄúOral sex, semen displacement, and sexual arousal: Testing the ejaculate adjustment hypothesis‚Äù. Evolutionary Psychology. 11 (5): 1130-1139. or to detect the presence of semen of other males in the vagina.Pham, Michael N.; Shackelford, Todd K. (2013). ‚ÄúOral sex as infidelity-detection‚Äù. Personality and Individual Differences. 54 (6): 792-795. = Mate choice = Sperm competition risk also influences males' choice of female partners. Men prefer to have as low of a sperm competition risk as possible, and they therefore tend to choose short-term sexual partners who are not in a sexual relationship with other men. Women who are perceived as the most desirable short-term sexual partners are those who are not in a committed relationship and who also do not have casual sexual partners, while women who are in a committed long- term relationship are the least desirable partners.Shackelford, Todd K.; Goetz, Aaron T.; LaMunyon, Craig W.; Quintus, Brian J.; Weekes-Shackelford, Viviana A. (2004). ‚ÄúSex difference in sexual psychology produce sex similar preferences for a short term mate‚Äù. Archives of Sexual Behavior. 33 (4): 405-412. Following the above, women who are at an intermediate risk of sperm competition, that is women who are not in a long-term relationship but who do engage in short-term mating or have casual sexual partners, are considered intermediate in desirability for short-term sexual partners.  Effects of sperm competition on human mating strategies  High levels of sperm competition among the great apes are generally seen among species with polyandrous (multimale) mating systems, while lower rates of competition are seen in species with monogamous or polygynous (multifemale) mating systems.Harcourt, A.H.; Purvis, A.; Liles, L. (1995). ‚ÄúSperm competition: Mating system, not breeding season, affects testes size of primates‚Äù. Functional Ecology. 9 (3): 468-476. Humans have low to intermediate levels of sperm competition, as seen by humans‚Äô intermediate relative testis size, ejaculate volume, and sperm midpiece size, compared with other primates. This suggests that there has been a relatively high degree of monogamous or polygynous behavior throughout our evolutionary history. Additionally, the lack of a baculum in humansDixson, Alan F. (1987). ‚ÄúBaculum length and copulatory behavior in primates‚Äù. American Journal of Primatology. 13: 51-60. suggests a history of monogamous mating systems. Males have the goal of reducing sperm competition by selecting women who are at low risk for sperm competition as the most ideal mating partners.  Intra-ejaculate sperm competition  Noticing that sperm in a mixed sample tends to clump together-- making it less mobile--and to have a high mortality rate, reproductive biologist Robin Baker, formerly of the University of Manchester, proposed about a decade ago that some mammals, including humans, manufacture \\"killer\\" sperm whose only function is to attack foreign spermatozoa, destroying themselves in the process. To test this idea, reproductive biologist Harry Moore and evolutionary ecologist Tim Birkhead of the University of Sheffield in the U.K. mixed sperm samples from 15 men in various combinations and checked for how the cells moved, clumped together, or developed abnormal shapes. \\"These are very simple experiments, but we tried to mimic what goes on in the reproductive tract,\\" Moore says. The team found no excess casualties from any particular donor or other evidence of warring sperm, they report in the 7 December Proceedings of the Royal Society. \\"The kamikaze sperm hypothesis is probably not a mechanism in human sperm competition,\\" says Birkhead. The findings are \\"the nail in the coffin for the kamikaze hypothesis,\\" says Michael Bedford, a reproductive biologist at Cornell University's Weill Medical Center in New York City. He says he had never given the idea much credence.  Female responses to sperm competition  A survey of 67 studies reporting nonpaternity suggests that for men with high paternity confidence rates of nonpaternity are (excluding studies of unknown methodology) typically 1.9%, substantially less than the typical rates of 10% or higher cited by many researchers. Cuckolded fathers are rare in human populations. \\"Media and popular scientific literature often claim that many alleged fathers are being cuckolded into raising children that biologically are not their own,\\" said Maarten Larmuseau of KU Leuven in Belgium. \\"Surprisingly, the estimated rates within human populations are quite low-- around 1 or 2 percent.\\" \\"Reliable data on contemporary populations that have become available over the last decade, mainly as supplementary results of medical studies, don't support the notion that one in 10 people don't know who their \\"real\\" fathers are. The findings suggest that any potential advantage of cheating in order to have children that are perhaps better endowed is offset for the majority of women by the potential costs, the researchers say. Those costs likely include spousal aggression, divorce, or reduced paternal investment by the social partner or his relatives. The observed low cuckoldry rates in contemporary and past human populations challenge clearly the well- known idea that women routinely 'shop around' for good genes by engaging in extra-pair copulations to obtain genetic benefits for their children,\\" Larmuseau said. Women are loyal to men who are good providers. \\"With DNA tests now widely available, so-called paternity fraud has become a staple of talk shows and TV crime series. Aggrieved men accuse tearful wives who profess their fidelity, only to have their extramarital affairs brought to light...The rule of thumb seems to be that males of higher socioeconomic status, and from more conventionally bourgeois societies, have greater warranted paternity confidence. Lower paternity confidence among those who are the principals for sensational media shouldn‚Äôt be surprising then.\\" Five days a week, you can tune into ‚ÄúPaternity Court,‚Äù a television show featuring couples embroiled in disputes over fatherhood. It‚Äôs entertainment with a very old theme: Uncertainty over paternity goes back a long way in literature. Even Shakespeare and Chaucer cracked wise about cuckolds, who were often depicted wearing horns. But in a number of recent studies, researchers have found that our obsession with cuckolded fathers is seriously overblown. A number of recent genetic studies challenge the notion that mistaken paternity is commonplace. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous,‚Äù said Maarten H.D. Larmuseau, a geneticist at the University of Leuven in Belgium who has led much of this new research.  Sperm competition in other primates  The relative size of human male testes is comparable to those primates who have single-male (monogamous or polygynous) mating systems, such as gorillas and orangutans, while it is smaller when compared to primates with polyandrous mating systems, such as bonobos and chimpanzees. While it is possible that the large testis size of some primates could be due to seasonal breeding (and consequently a need to fertilize a large number of females in a short period of time), evidence suggests that primate groups with multi-male mating systems have significantly larger testes than do primates groups with single-male mating systems, regardless of whether that species exhibits seasonal breeding. Similarly, primate species with high levels of sperm competition also have larger ejaculate volumes and larger sperm midpieces. Unlike all other Old World great apes and monkeys, humans do not have a baculum (penile bone). Dixson demonstrated that increased baculum length is associated with primates who live in dispersed groups, while small bacula are found in primates who live in pairs. Those primates that have multi-male mating systems tend to have bacula that are larger in size, in addition to prolongation of post- ejaculatory intromission and larger relative testis size.

Her works cover a wide array of media including sculpture, painting, printmaking, photography, and installation. Common themes to each of these are works that deal with her Uruguayan past and its history with dictatorships, the deconstruction of architectural elements, and a questioning of mankind's place in the built urban environment.  Personal life  Ana Tiscornia was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1951. She recalls as a child being influenced by an uncle who worked as an architect and as an early child wanted to grow up to be a construction worker. From 1971 to 1977, she studied architecture at the Universidad de la Rep√∫blica in Montevideo and specialized in technical drawings for plumbing systems. During the repressive political climate of the Military Dictatorships of 1973-85, Tiscornia reached out to the Engraving Club at the Montevideo School of Engraving (Escuela Taller de Artes Pl√°sticas Guillermo Fern√°nde) to connect with other artists who were prevented by the government from assembling. Inside the officially sanctioned meeting places, Tiscornia was free to discuss political ideas and developed her style in a repressed artistic climate. Her 2007 book Vicissitudes of The Imaginary: Between utopia and fragmented identity details her views on the artistic climate in Uruguay at this time. 1986 marked the beginning of Tiscornia gaining artistic recognition, taking prizes at the 2nd Biennial in Havana, Cuba, the 34th Municipal Salon in Montevideo, and winning the first place for the Paul C√©zanne Fellowship Award, earning a scholarship to study at Acad√©mie de Paris in France. After returning from Paris and gaining attention internationally, Tiscornia began to consider leaving Uruguay, ultimately immigrating to New York City in 1991. In the diverse art world of New York, she began to establish not only her Uruguayan identity, but also her identity in the larger Latin American arts community. A lot of her work from this period in the early 1990s, she says, reflects this growing sense of identity and what it meant to be stereotyped. Having more difficulties in New York, and on the international arts market than back home in Montevideo, Tiscornia began her work as curator for gallery exhibitions as well as teaching in 1996. She is Professor Emeritus from SUNY College at Old Westbury and currently resides in New York City.  Work  Untitled with Sky (six stained glass windows and twelve seats covered in mosaic tiles) by Liliana Porter and Ana Tiscornia using Willet Hauser Architectural Glass. At the Scarborough station in Briarcliff Manor, New York. Ana Tiscornia works in a variety of media including painting, sculpting, collage, photography, printmaking, and installation, working with a combination of traditional materials and everyday objects, her works explore Uruguay's complicated political history, emigration, urban spatiality, and identity. After moving to New York in 1991, Tiscornia's work largely reflects her feelings toward Uruguay's political history during the military dictatorships. Her work prior to leaving Uruguay was largely political and produced in collaboration with the Escuela Taller de Artes Pl√°sticas; this mode of expression was continued in her earliest works after emigrating from her homeland. Her series, Portraits (sometimes referred to as Thirteen Portraits or Trece Retratos) from 1996, consisting of thirteen anonymous photo portraits printed to be near- transparent, has been read as focusing on the forced emigration of political refugees, including the artist's own self-imposed exile. Another examining of the series looks at it in the context of los desaparecidos (the disappeared) from the military dictatorship era and has been featured in a number of expositions dealing with this theme. Tiscornia returned to this theme with a second series in 2000 titled Portraits II/ Retratos II that features another series of thirteen photos, this time of the reverse side of antique photo- frames. In 1996, Ana Tiscornia exhibited the first of two larger installation works, Camuflajes y olvidos at the [Museo Historico del Cabildo de Montevideo] in which Tiscornia juxtaposed negative space vinyl cutouts of a standing figure with meticulously placed domestic furnishing and household objects encapsulated by a box constructed of clear plastic. The work questions the homes left behind by people either abducted by the government or in exile abroad by highlighting the missing human element of the domestic interior. In the second installation, It Was the End of the Afternoon (1999), Tiscornia constructed a deteriorated room in the Smack Mellon Gallery (Brooklyn, New York). Filling odd cracks and displacements, she placed bits of text that referenced memory illnesses. Starting in 2002, Tiscornia began a series of sculptural installation works that situated portions of chairs against walls and floors in such a way that they appear to be half submerged in the fabric of their physical surroundings. This effect of emerging objects appears in a number of her works in the mid-2000s, and includes a series in which she places matte-black hammers as an installation on the wall. While the abstraction of physical space can be seen in a digital photo series from 2002, in 2007 Tiscornia's work looked to her architectural education by deconstructing the expectations of physical space. In House Project from 2007, she re-assembled cut pieces of a simple wooden model of a house at different angles. This artistic method is repeated again in works such as Situation (2008), For the Time Being (2010), and Untitled with Brick Wall (2012), as well as others, each time further abstracting the concept of physical space. In 2010, Tiscornia began exploring this idea in other media, Black Spots (2010), Red Grid (2011) and others, use cutouts of architectural drawings in order to assemble a collage, rendering the scenes chaotic, but with an underlying geometrical order. In 2011‚Äì12 she worked on a series of acrylic paintings that recreated this abstraction and deconstruction of form. Tiscornia's concern with physical space continues to be explored in other mediums. Starting in 2011, she began using cardboard cutouts of architectural models for her collage work, embracing the three-dimensionality of the medium. Works such as The Project (2011) and Fact of the Matter II (2011) appear to spill off the collage and content with the viewer's physical space, bridging the gap between collage and sculpture.

Places of Interest Antaliya is known for the shrine of Mahadev called the Antaleshvar. The linga is similar to swayambhu, which is a natural shape protruding from the ground and not a carved stone placed on the ground. This symbol of Mahadev is especially sacred. The community makes grain offerings to the shrine. A celebrated sati's paliyo is there, dated Samvat 1681 (1900 ) Shaka Samvat 1516. The inscription says that \\"Bai Jatna, wife of Samatji, took shelter with Ragnunathji on the seventh of the light half of the month of Chaitra.\\" The paliyo is built into the temple well, but the inscription has rapidly defaced as people washed clothes and beat them dry on the stone. This monument is said to be in memory of the wife of Samat Khuman, great-uncle of Loma Khuman, of Kherdi State. Several other monumental stones of the Khumans are there. The village was conquered by Thakor Vakhatsinghji of Bhavnagar State along with the rest of the Lilia and Kharapat district near the end of the eighteenth century.

Salam√© currently lives in Baltimore, Maryland where she is the Managing Director and Founder of Sol Print Studios.  Early life and education  Soledad Salam√© was born in Santiago, Chile in 1954. She attended Santiago College where she received her B.A. in Fine Arts in 1972. Salam√© continued her education in 1973 at the Sucre Technological Institute for Industrial and Graphic Design and in 1975-76 attended the Neumann Foundation Design Institute in Caracas, Venezuela. After receiving a Certificate in Making Paper by Hand from the Center for Education in Graphic Arts in 1978, Salam√© obtained a M.A., from the Graphic Arts Institute for Graphic Instruction at CONAC, in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1979.  Career  Soledad Salame‚Äôs career began in Venezuela where she was influenced by the natural elements of her environment, particularly the Amazon Rainforest. This interest in the natural world can be seen in much of her work spanning the entirety of her career. = Sundials = Salam√©‚Äôs first major project in 1983 was a comment on the energy of the sun and the movement of time in relation to the environment. This series of three large scale sculptures is made of a variety of found materials. Residing in the Sculpture Park at the Mines of Simon Bolvier, the piece entitled Sundial features a large stone, while Universal Structure, is made up of stacked and layered steel, along with elements of brass and bronze; this sculpture is also placed within a natural environment. In the technological piece entitled Three Eras, Salam√© uses brightly-colored rubber, steel, and plexiglass. The sundial is a working piece that moves in relation to the sun and is strategically placed near the El Avila mountain just outside of Caracas, Venezuela. = Baltimore Opera Company = Salam√© continued her career once she moved to the United States. In 1990, she embarked on a new project with the Baltimore Opera Company where she became the set designer for a production of Carmen, which received glowing reviews. The Baltimore Sun stated, ‚ÄúSalam√© gave the audience a kaleidoscope feast of reds, yellows, browns, and blues in painting and sculptures capturing at different depths, windows or city lights or precipices or buildings. Salam√© sent the viewers imagination roaming as the Bizet melodies splashed over them.‚Äù = Paintings = The paintings of Salam√© have been described as a unique style of abstract expressionism, combining recognizable imagery with dream-like surrealism. These qualities are evident in the series of paintings done in the early to mid-1990s. An example of this technique can be seen in her 1994 painting Interior I. This painting features structural elements of interior spaces such as corridors and stairways combined with a hazy color palette which enhances a viewing experience that transcends time and space. In the 1995 piece, City of Secrets, Salam√© once again uses the fragmented, abstract style seen in her earlier work. In each section of this composition the textural components of mixed media enhance its mysterious beauty, along with the strategic use of dark and light colors, adding intensity to the overall emotional expression of the work. = Garden of the Sacred Light = The installation, Garden of the Sacred Light, 1994, constructed of wood and glass, featuring grass, plants, and soil was featured in the traveling exhibition, Latin American Women Artists 1915-1994. The sculptural piece adorned with actual living plants embodies an ecological message of the evolution of art and nature. = Amber = The Amber (resin series), a medium Salam√© created herself and began working with in 2001, features Salam√©'s investigative studies of the natural world. Inspired by her interest in ecology of water systems, this series takes a scientific approach to the smallest elements of the natural world. In these pieces Salam√© has embedded small detailed drawings of insects and foliage into the layers of amber. These drawings are frozen in time where the translucent amber allows light to pass through, highlighting the fragile skeletal details of the decomposing life forms. = Growth = The installation, Growth, features two sections of grass emerging from dried hay. The organic materials evolve into handmade paper which is embellished with poetry and drawings of trees. The evolution of time in relation to the natural world are themes featured in this installations. = Labyrinth of Solitude = The 2001 installation Labyrinth of Solitude was created in response to the high levels of mercury found in the Tapojos River, one of the larges tributaries of the Amazon. Located in the atrium of the Museum of Fine Arts in Santiago, Chile, this large scale installation is a cumulation of Salam√©'s career as an artist thus far. The immensely long architectural piece encourages engagement from the viewer and emulates light, highlighting the detail of small-scale environments with in the piece. Natural elements of insects, hay, resin, and geodes are all incorporated to unify in the installation. The entire piece is a narrative commenting on the evolution of humanity and our impact on nature. Salam√© used a multitude of media to create the installation, including her drawings, large floating and illuminated plates of amber, natural elements of light and shadow and a plethora of organic materials. = Agua Fluida and Agua Vivas = A reoccurring theme in Salam√®‚Äôs work is the element of water. She began work studying rivers and water ways by depicting them using a variety of media in an attempt to capture the ever changing movements. The paintings, Amber River Triptych and Rapids, 2004, were the foundational works for her installations featuring the subject of water. In the 2005 exhibit, Agua Fluida, at Goya Contemporary in Baltimore, Maryland, Salam√© expands upon the subject of water by adding the element of movement. The project featured large-scale wall sized lenticular light boxes giving these abstract images an element of reality. The illusion of fluidity and movement is achieved by using this new form of visual imagery. In the 2006 exhibit, Aguas Vivas at the Museo Bellas Artes in Santiago, Chile, Salam√© further explores the subject of water through different media. The most notable installation within the exhibit is Antarctic Reflections which was done in graphite and acrylic on Mylar. The piece is based on the glacial landscapes of Antarctica spanning an entire wall, enhancing the horizontal perspective. = Islands, Atmospheres, Barcodes and Where Do You Live? = Salam√© has intently studied the natural world in a variety of places including the Amazon Rainforest, Antarctica, and the Maryland coast near her home. The focus of her ecological research is evident in her artwork and has evolved to include the study of human impact on the environment. The influence of global warming and climate change on the earth‚Äôs water sources, lakes, rivers, oceans can be seen in My Precious Island (2009), Atmospheres in Blue (2010), and the installation Where do you live?: Three Thousand Miles of Maryland Coastline (2009) where she uses satellite, infrared, and weather imagery as a visual language to illustrate coastline depletion and changing weather patterns. In the series Barcodes (2010), technology is not only the tool but the focus of the work. These works consist of metal panels silkscreened with images of islands overlaid with digital barcode patterns which distort the images. The islands become an abstracted image and draw attention to the role of technology in our changing environments. The barcode represents readable data and how this form of communication is the technological form of DNA found in natural life forms. The intensity of the electric green color further enhances the contradictory dynamics of the conflicts between nature and technology.  Sol Print Studios  Salam√© has continued her work within the art world through Sol Print Studios which she founded in 2009. The studio, located within her home in Baltimore, Maryland, offers weekend- long intensive workshops for small groups teaching the highly detailed printing technique of solar plate etching. The residency workshops are small, giving Salam√© an opportunity to work one-on-one with each student. Sol Print Studios has evolved to include workshops in other printing techniques including encaustic, chine coll√© (a type of printed collage), and embossing.  Publications  Salam√©‚Äôs work has been represented in many publications including, Contemporary Museum: 20 years, by Irene Hoffman (2011), The St. James Guide to Hispanic Artists, by Thomas Riggs (2002), Latin American Women Artists of the United States, by Robert Henkes (1999), and Latin American Art in the Twentieth Century, by Edward J. Sullivan (1996).

It broke ground in 1984 and was finished in the spring of 1986. It was built for recreation, such as boating, watersports and fishing. It has been described as a \\"killer dam\\" and a \\"drowning machine\\". Background Dam in 1911 The old Hepburn Street Dam (pre-1984) was made of wooden timber cribs filled with rock with a 4-inch thick wooden apron on the downstream side. The new dam, constructed in 1984‚Äì1986, was built for recreation. Before the dam was built, the average depth of the West Branch Susquehanna River was 4.6 feet, with its deepest parts being just under 10 feet deep. Some places were impassable by boat, being only a couple of feet or a few inches deep. Since the construction of the new dam, the average depth of the West Branch Susquehanna is 8.3 feet, with some depths of over 20 feet.  Hydroelectric proposal  Ever since the dam was rebuilt and updated Williamsport and county officials expressed interest in converting the low-head dam into a hydroelectric dam. Multiple companies have expressed interest in converting the dam in the past, however none have released a feasible plan to generate electricity there. In 2016, a privately-held hydropower development company that has projects in more than a dozen states believes its patented technology will make it feasible to generate clean viable electricity at the dam. Lock + TM Hydro Friends Fund XII, part of Hydro Green Energy based in Westmont, Illinois has filed preliminary permit application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to study the feasibility of its Hepburn Street Dam project. If such a permit is issued, it would give Hydro priority to file an application for a license to operate the facility. The project would impact only 150 feet at the northern or Williamsport side of the 1,015-foot dam that is formally known as the Anthony J. Cimini Dam in memory of a late state representative. The project would include a 25-foot deep large frame module containing 10, 900-megawatt hydropower turbines. It would be installed either in the levee on the Williamsport side of the river or in the upper pool of the dam, the permit application states. Engineering, legal and other expenses related to the feasibility study are estimated to cost $525,000, the FERC document states. The current timetable shows construction in 2018. When operational, the facility will generate an estimated 51,000 megawatts of electricity annually that will be sold to a utility or an industrial customer. A PPL substation is a short distance from the dam in Williamsport. Fish ladder The Hepburn Street Dam has a fish ladder located on the South Williamsport side of the dam. In 2014 the fish ladder was rebuilt‚Äîit was widened because sticks and debris were becoming stuck in the ladder, and more lanes were added so that more fish would be able to use the ladder.

History Mannheim's library system's origins date back to the early 20th century when Mannheim's City College of Trade (St√§dtische Handelshochschule) was founded in 1907, it maintained a large central library which was supplemented by various departmental libraries. In 1932 these libraries were merged with the Municipal Palace Library (St√§dtische Schlossb√ºcherei), which later became the Municipal Science Library Mannheim (Wissenschaftliche Stadtbibliothek Mannheim). When the National Socialists came to power in 1933, the College of Trade was dissolved and the books in its library were donated to the University of Heidelberg. In 1946 the bulk of the collection was returned when the \\"Staatliche Wirtschaftshochschule Mannheim\\" (State College of Business Mannheim) was founded. When the business college became a university in 1967, the library acquired new and much expanded collections in all the subjects taught at the university. It also inherited around 240,000 volumes of older books from the \\"Wissenschaftliche Stadtbibliothek Mannheim\\" (Scientific Municipal Library Mannheim), which was dissolved in 1970.

These give the robot movement and maneuverability against sea water resistance. The main difference between underwater thrusters and marine thrusters is the ability to work under heavy water pressure, sometime up to full ocean depth.  Types of underwater thrusters  Underwater thrusters can be divided in two main groups, hydraulic thrusters and electric thrusters. Electric thrusters are mainly used on battery operated underwater robots such as AUVs, submarines and electric ROVs. Hydraulic thrusters are mainly used on work class hydraulic ROVs. Hydraulic thruster technology is older than the electrical one, they are more rugged and their weight-to-thrust ratio is higher than electric thrusters, but maintenance and piping issues cause some dissatisfaction with users. Thanks to developing PMSM electric motors (wrongly knowing brushless DC Motor in market), electric thrusters are becoming more popular in newly designed products. Weight-to-thrust ratios are higher for hydraulic thrusters than for electric thrusters, but after taking into account the required hydraulic components including valves, hydraulic power units, pipes joints, etc. hydraulic thruster systems come out heavier than electric thrusters. Early models of electric thrusters had some reliability problems with electronic controllers, but power electronic developments have made them more rugged, and some models can be found on the market with more than 10 years ' service life and many years' warranty.  Electric underwater thrusters  The main components of an electric thruster are: Copenhagen Subsea 10-15kW electric underwater thruster A Lian innovations electric thruster # Electric Motor: The electric motor is the main component of electric thrusters and drives the propeller. Modern underwater thrusters usually use brush-less Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs). In some low-quality thrusters brushless D.C. motors are used. The gain is lower price and the penalty is lower efficiency. In most modern designs, frameless PMSM motors (mainly produced by Kollmorgen) are used to reduce the weight and increase the thermal efficiency. This improves the power-to-weight ratio, but the penalty is higher assembly cost. Danish based Copenhagen Subsea produces electrical ring thrusters, where the power is applied on the perimeter, and the motor components are integrated with a duct. # Gearbox: to match propeller torque with motor torque some manufacturers use a gearbox. Most of the time, to reduce the weight and volume of the thruster, the gears are assembled directly inside the thruster shell, which is used as the gearbox housing. In this way the weight is reduced, but repairs become difficult as the spare parts can not be found on the normal market. # Direct drive: In some modern designs which use PMSM motors, the ratio of motor torque to its diameter is so high that the motor can rotate the propeller without a gearbox. In direct drive underwater thrusters, the motors are heavier than those used in geared thrusters, but lack of a gearbox compensates for this. Direct drive thrusters have higher reliability, lower noise, and higher efficiency, but the prices are higher than geared thrusters. # Motor driver and electronics: Brushless motors need some electronics to be commutated and control their speed. In early versions the drivers were unreliable and this led to user dissatisfaction when compared with highly reliable hydraulic thrusters. More recently developments in power electronic technology have made the motor driver more efficient and reliable, cheap and small, to be fitted directly to the end of the motor. In modern designs the motor controllers are able not only to control the propeller RPM, but also to control the thrust force in applications that need close control on their positioning. # Shafting and sealing: Keeping the propeller in the right place and making it reliable in case of impact with external items such as fishes or fishing nets is one of the main concerns in all kinds of thrusters. Many failures have been reported due to this problem. Some manufacturers try to solve it by using magnetic couplings and totally avoiding rotary sealing. This improves reliability of the sealing and shafting, but they lose in efficiency due to limited torque transfer capability of the magnetic coupling and they solve this problem by using a high-speed, low-torque propeller. In most models the efficiency is as low as 25% which is very low for underwater thrusters. Magnetic bearings require the propeller to be rotated on the outer shell surfaces using a layer of water as a lubricant, which may reduce the bearing life considerably in contaminated water. Some other manufacturers use tapered bearings and a multiple sealing system for redundancy. In this design if the main seal (usually a ceramic seal) fails, the others seals keep the motor safe and the thruster can continue operation. # Propeller: The propeller is the component which converts rotation to thrust. Selection of the right propeller has a considerable influence on the performance a thruster. Each application's hydrodynamic load line needs a matched propeller for maximum efficiency, but there is lack of standard off-the-shelf propeller variation on the market and therefore it is impossible to order the thruster with the best efficiency propeller. Some companies will design and develop custom propellers, but their prices are really high. Other companies try to offer many propellers as options and let the user select the best one using performance charts of their thrusters. # Nozzle: Nozzles are used with heavy load, low-speed thrusters. Most ROVs have this type of hydrodynamic loads. In high-speed, light-load robots, such as AUVs, UUVs and submarines, usually the thrusters do not have a nozzle. #Propeller guards: Propellers may be damaged by impact from fish or other objects, but may vibrate if the flow to the blades is not uniform. The propeller guard design can affect the flow to the propeller and consequently the performance. Some manufacturers leave the design of the propeller guard to the user, but a more efficient solution is to integrate the function with the nozzle support struts. # Shell: Thruster shells usually must be resistant to seawater corrosion. There are two common version of shells; hard anodized aluminium and stainless steal grade 316. Steel is heavier, more expensive and more resilient. Aluminium is lighter and cheaper. # Electrical connector: Electrical connectors are important component of underwater thrusters. There is a wide range of reliable components available from third party suppliers.  Performance  There are lots of parameters that affect underwater thrusters considerably. Under the sea, energy become more valuable as it is difficult to transfer it (ROVs) or to store it (AUV, UUV, Submarine), Then its very important to have the maximum efficiency. Motor driver, electric motor, shafting, sealing, propeller, nozzle and thruster outer geometry and surface all affect the efficiency. # Matching the propeller load with motor torque: One of the more difficult design problem of underwater thrusters is to match the propeller load line with the motor power line. If it does not happen the overall efficiency of the thruster will fall well below maximum or only a small percentage of motor power will be used. # Using the right propeller: Propeller diameter, pitch ratio and type are very important to have the maximum performance. Lots of investigation and engineering must be done before final order of thruster to have the right choice. # Using low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) motor and driver: PMSM motors have some efficiency problems with THD. Low-THD motors and drivers are available on the market (Kolmorgen)but their prices are considerably higher than lower efficiency motors. Only high-tech Thrusters on the market using this type of motor and driver (Lian Innovative). # Streamlined Thruster Shell: Manufacturing of streamlined body and handle have a considerable effects on the efficiency, and manufacturing of the curves in this type of geometry is expensive.

Many visionaries emerged in the late fourteenth century that predicted the future of the Church. Visionaries often claimed that their visions came from God and that the Church should listen to what is being told. Unlike Catherine of Siena and Marie Robine, other visionaries of the Great Schism, Constance was denied any official recognition and Constance at one point had to extract herself from an inquisitorial interrogation only with great difficulty.Blumenfeld-Kosinski, \\"Constance de Rabastens: Politics and Visionary Experience in the Time of the Great Schism.\\" p. 148. During the Great Schism there were multiple popes, the pope and the antipope, and Constance's denial of any official recognition was because she endorsed the \\"wrong\\" pope through her divinely inspired prophetic pronouncements.Blumenfeld-Kosinski, Poets, Saints, and Visionaries of the Great Schism, 1378-1417. p. 93. Little is known about Constance's life as her confessor, Raymond de Sabanac (law professor at the University of Toulouse), decided not to write about her life and decided to only write about her visions.Rubin, Medieval Christianity in Practice, p. 292. Although there are not much known about Constance's life, there are documents about her visions and the letters she wrote to the inquisitor of Toulouse that are preserved in a Catalan translation in Biblioth√®que nationale de France. Most of Constance's visions were put together by her confessor, Raymond de Sabanac, but some series of visions were transmitted to Raymond by Constance's son.Blumenfeld- Kosinski, \\"Constance de Rabastens: Politics and Visionary Experience in the Time of the Great Schism.\\" p. 149. Personal life Constance de Rabastens was from a small town about half-way between Toulouse and Albi. She had a series of dramatic visions between 1384 and 1386 and attempted to intervene in the politics of her time. The turning point of Constance's life was when she took a trip to Toulouse. Leaving Rabastens and taking a trip to Toulouse made herself known to the ecclesiastical authorities that became aware of her visionary activities.Blumenfeld-Kosinski, \\"Constance de Rabastens: Politics and Visionary Experience in the Time of the Great Schism.\\" p. 151. Unfortunately, there are no traces of herself other than her visions and the letters she wrote to the inquisitor of Toulouse. There are no documents mentioning her and there are no traces of her in the works of other authors. The little we know about Constance is that she had a daughter, a son who is a Benedictine monk in Toulouse, and a husband. Constance became a widow as she lost her husband during early forties and, at one point, she was in prison. There is nothing more heard of Constance after 1386. One aspect of Constance's life is the relationship with her confessor, Raimond de Sabanac. Raimond was who put together all of the Constance's visions as he transcribed the visions for her. At one point in their relationship, Raimond stopped transcribing for Constance. Constance articulated this problem in one of her letters to the inquisitor of Toulouse as she asked for a secretary that can transcribe her visions. As Constance's visions became more public and known to the authorities of the church, they were ordered to cease the visions and the transcriptions. Despite Raimond's best efforts, Constance refused to be the perfect visionary and her headstrong support of the \\"wrong\\" pope, Pope Urban VI, could not be considered orthodox.Rubin, p. 294. Searching for an answer, Raimond asked God for a sign whether he should write or not, such as taking away his eyesight.Blumenfeld-Kosinski, \\"Constance de Rabastens: Politics and Visionary Experience in the Time of the Great Schism.\\" p. 160. Raimond only resumed to write for Constance as he was struck by an illness that the Voice identified as a sign from God. =Education= There seems to have been of no information about Constance's education or background but according to the visions she had, she admitted to not knowing the Book of Revelation. Constance never indicated she did any particular reading and any literacy Constance admits seems to seems to have been of miraculous origin. Most of the thirteenth-century saintly women often claimed ignorance and often professed unlearnedness to emphasize that the source of the visions was divine and not human.Blumenfeld-Kosinski, \\"Constance de Rabastens: Politics and Visionary Experience in the Time of the Great Schism.\\" p. 155-156. =Politics= Constance became involved with politics during the Great Schism. Constance claimed she was called upon to proclaim that archbishop of Toulouse backed the wrong pope in the Great Schism and will go to hell. The Great Schism of the Western Church began as the French cardinals voted Pope Urban VI and retracted their vote in order to replace him with Antipope Clement VII.Blumenfeld- Kosinski, \\"Constance de Rabastens: Politics and Visionary Experience in the Time of the Great Schism.\\" p. 147-148. This created chaos as the church had created both the pope and the antipope. Compared to Marie Robine and Catherine of Siena, Constance's intervention in politics did not go well because she supported the \\"wrong\\" pope of her region as she supported the Pope Urban VI instead of Antipope Clement VII. Also her convictions were contradictory as she was loyal to the French king, who supported Clement VII, and she worshiped Gaston III, Count of Foix, who remained neutral in most conflicts.Blumenfeld- Kosinski, \\"Constance de Rabastens: Politics and Visionary Experience in the Time of the Great Schism.\\" p. 154. As Constance's voice became more public, Guillaume de Luc, a master of the archbishop's entourage, have forbidden Raimond de Sabanac in writing down Constance's visions. Although Constance was consulted by highly placed people, she was still accused of being crazy and she did not have the kind of support Catherine of Siena had. Although Christ chosen her to explain the Holy Scriptures, according to her visions, it was not enough to confirm the divine origin of her visions to the inquisitor of Toulouse as they took it as a challenge to the authority.Rubin, p. 293. In 1385, Constance was taken in chains to the inquisitor of Toulouse, forbidden to publish her visions, and imprisoned. Constance was imprisoned for publicizing a series of apocalyptic revelations, and in one of the letter Constance notes that she was accused of \\"having a demon in her body,\\" though predictably she claimed direct inspiration from God.Caciola, p. 277. Couple instances of official queries displayed Constance's presence in the public arena. First instance was when a baron of the Bordelais asked her about Saracens who came to France looking for some sort of treasure. Constance informed him that the Saracens are the disciples of the Antichrist who sought to defeat the Christians. Second instance was when a clerk wanted to know from her whether the death of the Duke of Anjou is advantageous for the cause of the Church.Blumenfeld-Kosinski, \\"Constance de Rabastens: Politics and Visionary Experience in the Time of the Great Schism.\\" p. 158. The Visions Constance's visions started in 1384 as her husband faced death. Her first vision was a crowd of dead people accompanied by the voice with great mortality and her husband died shortly afterwards. Constance is called as \\"a sinful woman\\" by Christ but despite the sinfulness and her inability to read, she interpreted the scriptures to learned men as she received divine interventions. Most of Constance's visions were Christ appearing and encouraging her to preach and to urge the French nobility to stand against the English. Overall, Constance's visions cover her personal experience of Christ and intimate identification with Christ's pain. Constance uses her visions to accomplish her rather well defined and urgent political missions. After the initial vision, Constance's visions were mostly of an auditory nature. Instead of interpreting complicated visions, the Voices provided a ready-made script and allowed the mystics to supersede the authority, which required support of respected confessors and orthodox church in order to speak the voice of God outside of convent.Blumenfeld-Kosinski, \\"Constance de Rabastens: Politics and Visionary Experience in the Time of the Great Schism.\\" p. 155. In one of her vision, Christ appears as a man dressed in satin to assure her that he is in her heart. After another vision, Constance wonders whether the visions and the Voices are truly from God as the Voice presents the Book of Revelations. Constance defined her political mission as she was commanded by the Voice. The Voice commanded Constance to send a letter to the King's Council in Toulouse to stop the support for the pope at Avignon, Clement VII. Following the Voice's command, Constance used strong terms and colorful images in her denunciation that leaves no doubts about the nature of her political interventionBlumenfeld-Kosinski, \\"Constance de Rabastens: Politics and Visionary Experience in the Time of the Great Schism.\\" p. 152. In Constance's visions, the French cardinals who elected Clement VII are compared to false prophets who knew well that the election of the pope of Avignon was done against God's will. To counteract the false prophets, she stated that the red beast, the pope of Rome, will rise. The red beast was spoken by John in the book of revelations and the color red signifies the fire of justice. Constance also designated the cardinals as ‚Äúanticardonals‚Äù who surround the ‚Äúantipapal‚Äù of Avignon. Constance presented this pope in many unpleasant ways: She saw a temple full of smoke and darkness and the pope of Avignon was inside. Later, she also saw three ships which two signified the world and the church. She stated that a limping man entered one of the former and made the ship instantly sink to the bottom of the sea. This limping man represented the Pope of Avignon. She also saw an angel holding a bloody sword above the pope as if he were about to kill him.Blumenfeld-Kosinski, Poets, Saints, and Visionaries of the Great Schism, 1378-1417. p. 152. Around the same time period, similar to Constance's vision, Honor√© Bonet's exegesis of the Apocalypse displayed smoke rising from the pit and covering up the sun of the church (representing the pope). Although Blumenfeld-Kosinski states, \\"people in different time periods and areas created imagery and depicted emotions that were quite similar and that expressed their anguish and uncertainty in the face of multiple popes\\"Blumenfeld-Kosinski, Poets, Saints, and Visionaries of the Great Schism, 1378-1417. p. 209. during 1384-1386, when Constance had her visions, Bonet spent time in Constance's region composing history of the Count of Foix, including Constance's savior figure, Gaston III, Count of Foix. No acquaintance between Constance and Bonet can be made but there is certain coincidences in the images portrayed by them.Blumenfeld-Kosinski, Poets, Saints, and Visionaries of the Great Schism, 1378-1417. p. 138-139. Ultimately, what Constance saw as her primary mission is articulated by the voice as it told her \\"do not doubt, for I tell you that the time has come for the Son of Man to show his power and it will be shown in you. For you are a woman and through woman was the faith preserved and through woman it will be revealed; and that woman is you.\\"Blumenfeld-Kosinski, \\"Constance de Rabastens: Politics and Visionary Experience in the Time of the Great Schism.\\" p. 162-163. Most of Constance's visions and prophecies were never fulfilled except for one, when she predicted the madness of Charles VI of France in 1385.Blumenfeld-Kosinski, \\"Constance de Rabastens: Politics and Visionary Experience in the Time of the Great Schism.\\" p. 159. The Letters to the Inquisitor The six letters to the inquisitor were written early on in her visionary career (1384), when Raimond stopped writing for her due to fear and restrictions. In these letters, Constance showed her desire for safety as there was urgency in her voice. Constance, aware of the riskiness of her proclamations, warned the inquisitor that the voice promised divine vengeance on Toulouse for any harm done to her. She insisted that this threat came from the voice and not from her. She wrote that she will abide by their counsel but insisted that she will not cease her visions. Since Raimond was not writing for her, Constance even asked the inquisitor for secretaries who would record and disseminate her visions. Constance even warned the inquisitor of his impending death and insisted that an accurate transcript of the trial be made but no transcript of the trial was ever found.Blumenfeld-Kosinski, \\"Constance de Rabastens: Politics and Visionary Experience in the Time of the Great Schism.\\" p. 161. =Letter One= Constance stated that her confessor, Raimond, will not write anything for her except for the letter. She stated in her letter that she was told by God to write to the inquisitor because he did not want to believe the things that he sent through Constance. During Constance's conversation with God, she tells him that no one will believe her but God insists saying, ‚ÄúI command you once, twice, three times to tell them, so they will have no excuses. And you are not the one who is speaking, but it is the Holy Spirit that speaks in you.‚Äù She told the inquisitor to hold a council regarding God's commands or she fears that God will avenge himself on those who meddled in on the choosing of Clement VII. She also told the inquisitor that she was afraid sending this letter because of the things told by her confessor but God told her not to be afraid because it is time the bad seeds should be thrown out for the good ones.Venarde, Bruce L., Renate Blumenfeld-Kosinski, Simone Zanacchi, and Raymond De Sabanac. Two Women of the Great Schism. p. 67-68. =Letter Two= Constance wrote again to notify the inquisitor of the things happening to her as she was having more visions than before. In the letter, she stated that her confessor does not want to write her visions down. She told the inquisitor that she was told by God to write to him but because he took it badly, he should put his heart to guarding his sheep as the bad days are coming. She told the inquisitor of the voice that spoke to her, ‚Äútell the inquisitor that before long he will be interrogated and that he should not fear death, and that the trial did not take place for nothing, and that he should watch that the record corresponds to what was said at the trial, and that God tells him that he will have to render an account of the trial and the record.‚ÄùVenarde, p. 68-69. =Letter Three= In this letter, Constance stated that she is writing this letter because she is afraid that God will reprimand her for negligence if she does not write. Constance stated that the voice told her, ‚Äúwrite to the inquisitor that he should preach the misfortunes that are prepared for the evil ones, for the days of trembling are approaching. For this reason, he should take care of the souls for it is his responsibility that, if the people of God is deceived out of ignorance, they will receive their punishment.‚Äù She also told the story of her conversation about how she told God that no one will believe her but God told her that because she carried his seal, Holy Scriptures, people should receive her well. Constance told the inquisitor more stories of the conversation between her and God and that the inquisitor should have prayers said to God and arrange processions, considering what she has seen.Venarde, p. 69. =Letter Four= As she continued to write to the inquisitor, Constance stated that the more she resisted the visions and revelations, the more they continued and more than before. Constance spoke about the vision she had which consisted of three cardinals that was in great torment and pain and one of them being more tormented compared to the other two. She revealed that the cardinal who was tormented the most was Sir Pierre de la Barriere and that she told this to her confessor. Constance stated that the confessor told her to reject the vision because it was untrue since he knew no one of the first name Pierre and that de la Barriere is a good person. Contradicting her confessor, Constance had a vision which told her that, ‚Äúyou should know that what you have seen is true, no matter what your confessor says. Know that his first name is really Pierre and that he can be compared to a stone, that is, the stone that brought the worst destruction to the path, and the stone on which the good seed fell but could not flourish. He preached lies and false errors before the king. He is not content with his own damnation, but wants to pull others into damnation with him. He is called la Barriere because he established a barrier between me and himself.‚Äù She stated that she was told to notify the inquisitor of these things completely and at length. Constance continued to describe her visions in this letter of Pierre being punished and also that she is afraid their failure to publish her visions will result in Christian faith falling into disgrace. Constance told the inquisitor that she is prepared to die for God's honor and the salvation of the people. As she closed out the letter, she cried out for the inquisitor's trust in her visions and requested for an answer. There was an urgency in Constance's voice, to convince the inquisitor that her visions are indeed real, as she tried to prove herself by stating that she is explaining the Holy Scriptures to him when she does not know them.Venarde, p. 69-71. =Letter Five= Constance sent this letter to the inquisitor, the collector, and to the Lord Yncart in 1384. Constance stated that because she has been told not to reveal her visions other than to her confessor and the inquisitor, she has been withholding them but she is worried because the visions are showing many revelations that concerns the damnation of the community. She told the inquisitor that it will be hers and his fault if her revelations are true and the great damnation comes. Constance demanded for secretaries, as her confessor does not want to write for her, that can write down her revelations because she had been ordered to tell, shout, and trumpet her revelations by God.Venarde, p. 71-72. =Letter Six= In the final letter, Constance talked about the visions that has been revealed to her about the two men sent to English, that made league with the English, by the price of the realm of France. Constance stated that, ‚ÄúThey have sworn and denied God and his power and accepted the demon as their lord. And he will give all his help and support to the English king against the young tree, that is the French king, and if he can he will destroy the king and his realm, just as Pilate, when he was governor of Jerusalem, did not recognize our God who was from Jerusalem.‚Äù Constance also stated that the ‚Äúcrane with a vimilion head‚Äù will come and destroy the prince and that there will be a great alliance between the French king and the crane. Constance wished that all of her revelations are transmitted to the inquisitor so he knows who is the prince in question.Venarde, p. 72-73.

Work  Noem√≠ Ruiz's paintings are abstract in a non-representational style and very colorful interpret Latin American reality by using rhythmic color and alternating forms, trying to convey it all in a symbolic way. With sensitivity, discipline and mastery, Ruiz embodies her essential forms in the reality. Conceptually and symbolically, personal and natural elements can be seen presently in her pieces. Red and blue are common colors to see in her works, and at least one of the two seems to be present in every painting. She started out strictly geometric in her painting, but it melded into more organic visually, not unlike the human form and landscapes. Noemi Ruiz uses a technique of painting in which she applies the paint with a foam roll, which allows for uniform layers of color. She would normally avoid textured painting, but has recently utilized it. > ‚ÄúIntention and result combine in the work of Noem√≠ Ruiz to achieve a Latin > American and Caribbean presence that proves to be outstanding in > contemporary Puerto Rican art.‚Äù > ‚Äì Jeannette Miller, Dominican writer and professor. = List of works = Telluric Presence Nocturnal Mystery  Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico:  Jazz (20th C) Caribbean land, texture and heat (21st C) Time Space-Sidereal plan I (21st C) Rhythm of blues and hidden labyrinth (21st C) Shooting star line (path), a Fall wish (21st C) Forms floating in space and breath of life (21st C) Study-composition of form and color (21st C) Red Space and sailboats on the time (20th C) Blue encounter with a Mask (20th or 21st C) Intruder coqu√≠ (20th C) Summer's Heat (20th C)  Coleccion Reyes-Veray:  Civilizaci√≥n (20th C) Talism√°n Mi Isla Verde (21st C) Tensi√≥n (21st C) Tension (21st C)  Biaggi-Faure:  Espacio Rojo y Veleros en el Tiempo (21st C) Recuerdo Ancestral (21st C) Cuba: Paisaje de Playa con Destellos y Habana Blue (20th C) Vida: Composici√≥n de Formas y Sentires (21st C) Jard√≠n del Pensamiento (21st C) = Collections = Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Puerto Rico (San Juan) Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico (San Juan) Cooperativa de Seguros Multiples de Puerto Rico (San Juan)  References  Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Puerto Rican painters Category:Puerto Rican women painters Category:New York University alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Interamerican University of Puerto Rico alumni Category:People from Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico ","title":"Noem√≠ Ruiz"},{"id":"50413150","text":"Mary Lindsay Thornton Mary Lindsay Thornton (12 June 1891 - 27 September 1973) was the first curator of the North Carolina Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

They lived between modern Danilovgrad and Podgorica. By the late 16th century they were slavicized and later assimilated into Bjelopavliƒái.  History  The Malon≈°iƒái were of Albanian origin. Their name is related to the Albanian word mal (mountain), a toponym and anthroponym which is very frequent among Albanian communities in modern Montenegro. The locality of Malenza in their home territory has been connected by P. ≈†obajiƒá to their name and has been interpreted as a compound mal and zi (black). The tribe encompassed parts of what was later Zagaraƒç, Komani and Bjelopavliƒái. The area of the Malon≈°iƒái is located in southern Danilovgrad Municipality and northern Podgorica municipality. The tribe lived in the basin of the Zeta, Su≈°ica and Mareza rivers. The Malon≈°iƒái are first mentioned in 1411 in a report by the Republic of Ragusa in which together with Bjelopavliƒái, Ozriniƒái and Mazniƒái they formed groups of bandits who raided trade caravans in the routes that connected Dalmatia with Serbia. In 1452 they were one of the tribes which supported Stefan Crnojeviƒá against ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá and in 1455 along with Crnojeviƒá they swore fealty to Venice in the Vranjina Monastery. Some of them after the conquest of the region by the Ottoman Empire fled their homeland and settled in Venetian territories, Kotor in particular. The tribe appears as part of the communities who paid taxes to ƒêuraƒë Crnojeviƒá who was an Ottoman vassal. In the defters of the Sanjak of Montenegro from 1521 to 1582/3 under Skender Bey Crnojeviƒá, they are listed as a distinct nahiya.

McNamara became interested in the crimes of the unidentified rapist and murderer known as the East Area Rapist, Original Night Stalker and the Visalia Ransacker, among other epithets. Due in large part to McNamara's efforts in tying these crime clusters together in public consciousness after the EAR and ONS crimes were linked by DNA, the murderer was later to be known only as the Golden State Killer (GSK). She penned articles for Los Angeles magazine about the serial killer in 2013 and 2014. Paul Holes, an investigator for the Contra Costa County district attorney's office stated that McNamara's dogged persistence and trustworthiness with sensitive information about GSK cases earned her an unusual level of cooperation from law enforcement officials.Billy Jensen (2019).

According to Ars Technica, the film offers \\"a fast-paced, uninterrupted delivery of superficial and false claims about climate science\\". Synopsis Climate Hustle challenges the scientific consensus on climate change, arguing that the consensus is overstated and part of an \\"environmental con job being used to push for increased government regulations and a new 'Green' energy agenda\\". It offers a series of segments which present arguments that function to cast doubt on aspects of the consensus, pointing to perceived inconsistencies, errors, and political hypotheses. Sections include interviews and commentary by Morano. It begins with an explanation of three-card Monte, a confidence game scam offered as a metaphor for climate change arguments. Production Climate Hustle was directed and produced by Christopher Rogers, president of Washington, D.C.-based media production company CDR Communications. The conservative group Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT) provided funding. The film is billed as a \\"CFACT Presents\\" production, and the organization's president and executive director, David Rothbard and Craig Rucker, are credited as executive producers. CFACT also sponsors Morano's blog, Climate Depot. =Release= Climate Hustle premiered in Paris, France on 7 December 2015, coinciding with the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. Its U.S. premiere was held on 14 April 2016 at the Rayburn Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., and was followed by a discussion panel that included former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and David Legates, a climatologist and geology professor at the University of Delaware whose work is funded by Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel sponsors.https://www.ceoe.udel.edu/our-people/profiles/legates It was moderated by conservative writer Brent Bozell. U.S. Representative Lamar S. Smith, Republican of Texas, was set to attend but instead prepared opening remarks which included an accusation that U.S. government agencies had tampered with climate data. It was shown for one day in 400 theaters across the United States on 2 May 2016. In an interview with Variety about the film, Palin explained her passion for the issue, offering an anecdote about her 2008 lawsuit against the U.S. government, challenging the polar bear's placement on the threatened species list under the Endangered Species Act. Palin took issue with the forecasting data produced by biologists and environmental groups that showed a threat due to declining Arctic sea ice, although a federal judge backed the scientists' original findings. The film's cinema engagement is managed by Fathom Events and SpectiCast. Reception Writing for The New York Times, Randy Olson, who had previously interviewed Morano for his own mockumentary film, Sizzle: A Global Warming Comedy (2008), called Climate Hustle \\"boring\\", with \\"the light-hearted and entertaining feel of a Michael Moore film, but [not] in the same league.\\" Olson did not comment on the scientific or pseudoscientific content, instead evaluating the film from a cinematic perspective. While he found the editing to be \\"decent\\", he criticized quality of the visuals, lighting, and explained the narrative structure as a series of sequences which all come to the same conclusion: \\"climate scientists have it all wrong and are conspiring to deceive the public.\\" Ars Technica likewise panned the film, saying its \\"sections all run together, with topics appearing multiple times and with no real thread to follow.\\" For The Guardians Suzanne Goldberg, \\"the real mission for Palin and the makers of the movie -- in addition to airing various conspiracy theories -- was to register the continued existence of a small but still powerful fringe, even as the rest of the world accelerates its efforts to fight climate change.\\" Several reviewers have drawn comparisons to Al Gore's 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth. = Criticism of scientific content= The film's basis is in a rejection of the overwhelming scientific consensus about climate change and the impact of human activities on it. The Guardian was critical of the film's \\"[dismissing] global warming as an excuse for government takeover and [making] the outrageously false claim that rising carbon emissions are beneficial.\\" The Washington Post called it a \\"tour through the arguments that some holdout scientists do still make to undermine mainstream climate concerns.\\" The Post challenges the validity of several of the film's claims directly, which it characterizes as \\"the same things they've been arguing for many years, albeit with regular touch-ups.\\" Ars Technica likened the film's style to a \\"Gish Gallop\\", calling it \\"a fast-paced, uninterrupted delivery of superficial and false claims about climate science\\" which forms \\"an 80-minute-long list of all the climate 'skeptic' blogosphere's favorite claims.\\" The film features a number of expert testimonies in support of its claims. According to Scott K. Johnson of Ars Technica, those who \\"could fairly call themselves climate scientists [are] drawn from the small stable of familiar contrarians that cycle through Congressional hearing when contrarian witnesses are in demand\\" while others are \\"straight out of the Rolodex of the Heartland Institute\\".

Families belonging to this clan ruled several kingdoms in north India and held various feudal estates. The most notable of these were the Chandelas of Jejakabhukti, who ruled the Bundelkhand region.  History  During 10th to 13th century CE, the Chandelas of Jejakabhukti ruled the Bundelkhand region in present-day Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The British indologist V. A. Smith theorised that the Chandelas were of either Bhar or Gond origin, a theory also supported by other some scholars including R. C. Majumdar. According to this theory, the Chandelas were originally Bhars, Gonds or a mixture of these two communities; they later styled themselves as Kshatriya Rajputs after attaining political power. =Gidhaur zamindari= Gidhaur palace The zamindari estate of Gidhaur in Munger district, present-day Bihar was controlled by a branch of the Chandel Rajputs. They are considered to be one of the oldest ruling families in Bihar. It was established by Bir Bikram Shah whose ancestors came from Mahoba in Bundelkhand but were driven into Bihar during the 12th century following various Muslim incursions. They managed to gain control of Gidhaur after expelling the various aboriginal chiefs from the region. Bir Bikram Shah slowly started to expand his chieftaincy to encompass the surrounding areas. Other rulers belonging to this lineage include Sukhdev Singh, Ram Naranjan Singh and Darp Narayan Singh. = Zaildari estates = A group of Chandel families claiming a common origin once held the zaildaris of Ghund, Madhan, and Theog in present-day Himachal Pradesh.

While studying the enzymes that release auxin from precursor molecules, Bartel's laboratory discovered that the endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes compartmentalize auxin production pathways. This connection between the metabolism of auxin precursors and cellular organelles led her group to new findings in auxin signaling and to the discovery of new peroxisomal matrix components. She is the author of more than 100 publications in the scientific literature.

Throughout her life she was active in both the local and national political scene and her accomplishments range from writing fiction novels to serving on the Defense Advisory Committee for Women. Abbott worked to bring more women into the public sphere, saying that \\"Women are a neglected resource. They are not sufficiently recognized and their full potential is not often developed\\". Early life Delila M. Richards was born on November 4, 1908, to John C. Richards and Clara Bacon in West Jordan, Utah. John was a carpenter, and he and Clara were both natives of West Jordan. Delila graduated from Jordan High School and went on to attend LDS Business College in Salt Lake City, Utah. On June 25, 1930, she married Floyd A. Abbott, also a life-time resident of West Jordan. The young couple initially moved to Spokane, Washington, but were forced back to Utah with the onset of the Great Depression. Floyd graduated from the University of Utah in 1928, worked as a pharmacist, and later joined the U. S. Army during World War II. Five months after Floyd's departure, Delila gave birth to their son Richard Abbott. Political career Abbott began her political career in the late 1940s as a watcher at the polls and a member of the Salt Lake County Republican Central Committee. In 1954, she was elected as the Republican Party County Vice Chairman (a position she would hold for the next six years), but also became involved at the state level. She served as the Supervisory Clerk for the Utah Senate in 1955 (and again in 1959) and the same year was invited to attend the Republican Women's National Conference in Washington, D.C., as the Utah State Conference chairman. In 1957, she was elected to the Utah House of Representatives.Historical Listing of Utah State Legislators Though she served for only one year, as a representative she acted as chair of both the Patronage and Rules Committees and was a member of several others. Over the next 20 years, Abbott held and/or campaigned for numerous other local and state offices and organizational positions, some of which include: * Republican Party Western Conference Representative (1958) *Candidate for Salt Lake County Clerk (1958) *Census Crew Leader (1961) * Vice President of the Salt Lake City Women's Republican Club (1961‚Äì62) *Committee Member of the National Council of Women of the United States (1963) *Committee Member of the International Council of Women (1963) * President of the Utah Order of Women Legislators (1976) Of these offices, Abbott was the most influential during a three-year appointment as a member of the United States Defense Department's Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services beginning in 1960. The purpose of the committee was to advise the U.S. Defense Department on policies in regards to women in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. The committee itself was considered the \\"top echelon\\" of women's civilian advisory committees, and its agenda and the identities of those making the appointments was kept a complete secret. As a member of the committee and the chairman of the organization sub-committee, Abbott promoted many policy changes to assist the U.S. military in utilizing its women more effectively. Her achievements were many as committee chairman, but she became popular in Utah for \\"bucking\\" regulation and fighting to allow servicewomen to wear more comfortable and stylish clothing‚Äîin particular, their skirts.

After flowering linear yellow woodyseed pods form that are around in length and around wide. The mottled seeds within the pods have an ovate to oblong shape and are about in length. The phyllodes resemble those of Acacia tetragonophylla and the acicular phyllode variant of Acacia maitlandii. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1863 as part of the work Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. It was reclassified as Racosperma quadrisulcatum by Leslie Pedley in 2003 then transferred back to the genus Acacia in 2006. Distribution It is native to an area between Northampton and Shark Bay in the Mid West region of Western Australia where it is found on sand plains and sandhills growing in sandy clay soils over limestone or laterite. The shrub is usually part of a heath or shrubland communities.

Biography Divers at Work Repairing a Torpedoed Ship (1918) (Art.IWM ART 2245) Wheatley was born in Abergavenny in Wales and was the only son of Sir Zachariah Wheatley, a former mayor of the town. The younger Wheatley attended the Slade School of Art during 1912 and 1913, having previously taken art lessions from both Stanhope Forbes and Walter Sickert. During World War One, Wheatley served in the Artists' Rifles and later in the conflict was an official war artist. The British War Memorials Committee appointed Wheatley to record the work of the Royal Navy in the British home ports. After a short, and miserable, few days at Rosyth Wheatley was sent to Southampton where he recorded the work of the Salvage Service. He produced over 40 paintings there including a large canvas for the proposed, but never built, national Hall of Remembrance. After the War, Wheatley was commissioned to paint a portrait of James Crichton, a recipient of the Victoria Cross. Wheatley showed three works at the first annual exhibition of the newly-formed Society of Graphic Art in 1921. He held a joint show with Muirhead Bone at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1922 and taught at the Slade for five years from 1920 until 1925 when he, and his wife the artist Edith Grace Wheatley, nee Wolfe, moved to South Africa. The couple remained there until 1937, during which time John Wheatley was the Michaelis Professor of Fine Art at the University of Cape Town and Director of the National Gallery of South Africa. On his return to England in 1937, Wheatley was appointed director of the Sheffield City Art Galleries. During the Second World War, the War Artists' Advisory Committee commissioned Wheatley to paint several portraits of workers involved in the war effort. From 1948 to 1950, Wheatley was curator of the National College of British Sports and Pastimes. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Two paintings by John Wheatley were burned by demonstrators during the Rhodes Must Fall upheaval at the University of Cape Town in February 2016: a portrait of Edward, Prince of Wales and one of Alexander Brown.GroundUp, 9 June 2017.

The experiment was planned for the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. This coincidence of RAINEX with the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season led to the study and exploration of infamous hurricanes Katrina, Ophelia, and Rita. Where Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita would go on to cause major damage to the US Gulf coast, Hurricane Ophelia provided an interesting contrast to these powerful cyclones as it never developed greater than a category 1. The RAINEX project was a collaboration between the University of Miami (UM), Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS), The University of Washington, Department of Atmospheric Sciences, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Navy, Office of Naval Research. The objective of the research was to study the mechanism by which hurricane eyewall replacement cycle occurs. Luckily for the sake of the research, one such case of eyewall replacement occurred during the study of Hurricane Rita. In tropical cyclones maximum wind speed of the storm, which occurs at the eyewall, is a primary indicator of its overall strength which is important in predicting overall intensity. Just beyond this eyewall is a moat which separates the inner rainbands (eventually the outer eyewall) from the (inner) eyewall. Better understanding the dynamics of this region before, and during eyewall replacement could aid in better intensity predictions. Background RAINEX‚Äô main purpose was to accomplish this task via studying the fluctuations of storm intensity as they are influenced by interactions between the eye, eyewalls, and rainbands of a tropical cyclone. Previously, tropical cyclone intensity forecasting was heavily based on sea surface temperature and upper- atmosphere dynamics. These factors are useful in predicting the maximum potential of a tropical cyclone. However, since the intensity of a storm undergoes large daily fluctuations, the maximum possible intensity of a cyclone is usually not reached. =Hurricane Structure= The structure of Hurricane Rita as seen by ELDORA radar Most hurricanes exhibit a definitive eyewall and spiral rainbands outside of the eye. These spiral rainbands were known to be complex structures that possess deep convective cores enmeshed in low altitude precipitative clouds. The eye or core of a tropical cyclone is characterized by low pressure which causes warm air to spiral upward and rise into the atmosphere. A tropical cyclone usually develops a distinct eye when the maximum sustained winds of the storm reach and exceed 74 mph. A well- formed eye is a good indicator of overall intensity due to an increase in rotational velocity when the distance between the moving particles and the center of the vortex is decreased. The angular momentum associated with the tropical cyclone can explain this phenomenon. Angular momentum of a particle with mass, m with respect to the origin, r, can be given by L = mvr(sin(Œ∏)) When r is decreased (the distance between the moving particle and the center of the vortex), the mass of this particle, m remains the same and the angular momentum, L is conserved. Therefore, the rotational velocity of the particle must increase. In tropical cyclones, when the eye contracts, wind speed increases. Another example of this intensification can be seen in figure skating. When a spinning figure skater pulls his/her arms in to their chest while spinning the distance between the skaters hands and his/her angular momentum is conserved but his/her rotational velocity, v increases. Experimental Design Three P-3 Orion aircraft were deployed during 13 flights into Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Ophelia. Two of the WP-3D aircraft were owned and operated by NOAA and were named N42 and N43. The P-3 N42 was equipped with a fore and aft fixed flat-plate antenna which served as a dual- beam Doppler weather radar. The P-3, N43 was equipped with one single- parabolic antenna which was able to operate as a dual-Doppler radar by alternating scanning direction (once again between fore and aft). These NOAA aircraft were able to attain 1.5 km horizontal resolution. The third P-3, NRL, was equipped with an ELDORA (Electra Doppler radar) and was the first ELDORA used in the imaging of tropical cyclones. In addition to the radars, each aircraft was equipped with a large quantity of dropsondes to be deployed every 5‚Äì10 minutes (about 30‚Äì65 km on flight path). During Hurricane Katrina, 302 dropsondes were deployed, during Ophelia 462, and Rita 503. A detailed description of dropsonde specifications can be found in Hock and Franklin 1999. The aircraft transmitted all of the information collected by these instruments to the RAINEX operations center (ROC) at RSMAS during flight in order for the ground team to forecast the development of the tropical cyclone while flight crews were in the air and afterward. =Equipment= The experiment entailed a high-resolution numerical model of the internal structure of the vortex and collection of data by three P3 Orion aircraft equipped with dual beam Electra Doppler weather radar and intensive dropsonde coverage. These aircraft were based at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida. All flights were controlled from the RAINEX operations center (ROC) at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) at the University of Miami (UM). Postanalysis was to include high- resolution model simulations of the data collected in flight at the RSMAS atmosphere-wave-ocean modeling system. Two NOAA P-3 aircraft equipped with Doppler radar =Project Communications= As data was collected in the field, satellite communications relayed the information from aircraft to the RAINEX Operations Center at RSMAS. In order to determine which days were suitable for flight, principal investigators, forecasters, pilots, and facility engineering staff held a daily conference call originating from the RSMAS center in Miami, Florida. Based on the forecast of evolution of the tropical cyclone throughout the proposed time of flight, principal investigators would develop a plan of flight for the day. Flight patterns typically followed one of two plans accepting special cases. Plan A was usually selected when aircraft were to arrive during a time without eyewall replacement. Plan B was employed when eyewall replacement was expected to occur during flight. For instance, during flight into Hurricane Rita a second eyewall was forming and Plan B was executed. Notable Hurricanes View from P-3 aircraft from inside the eyewall of Hurricane Katrina =Hurricane Katrina= Because RAINEX was planned in advance of the 2005 Atlantic Hurricane Season, it did fly in to Hurricane Katrina among other storms. Hurricane Katrina followed a very similar track to a later storm in this season (Hurricane Rita); however, Katrina did not undergo eyewall replacement during its time in the Gulf of Mexico. RAINEX flights into Hurricane Katrina occurred on August 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29, 2005. These flights followed the storm through its development from a tropical cyclone into a Category 5 hurricane. =Hurricane Ophelia= Hurricane Ophelia was an interesting storm to document due to its long duration and considerable fluctuations in strength throughout its existence. RAINEX flights into Hurricane Ophelia occurred on September 6, 9, and 11, 2005. =Hurricane Rita= Hurricane Rita was not a welcome sight in the Gulf of Mexico following the devastating Katrina. Hurricane Rita underwent eyewall replacement while in the Gulf of Mexico where the storm went from a category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale to a category 3 storm by landfall. RAINEX flights into Hurricane Rita occurred on September 20, 21, 22, and 23, 2005. These flights observed the rapid development of Hurricane Rita from a Category 1 hurricane into a Category 5 and eventually through its eyewall replacement cycle and weakening.

Many had returned to work when violence erupted on August 1 after a mob attacked the town's mayor, and then clashed with local militia, leaving four dead and many more wounded. State and federal troops were called to the town, and imposed martial law. Minor acts of violence continued until the last of the strikers returned to work on October 17, having won no concessions. More than a score of those involved in the shooting were arrested for murder, and later tried and found not-guilty of the crime of manslaughter. Two were tried and one convicted in libel suits related to published criticism of the militia. The militia would go on to be reformed into a battalion of the Pennsylvania National Guard. Opinions differ on the root causes of the strike and ensuing violence. Background Burning of Union Depot, Pittsburgh, 21‚Äì22 July 1877 The Long Depression, sparked in the US by the Panic of 1873, had far reaching implications for US industry, shuttering more than a hundred railroads in the first year and cutting construction of new rail lines from 7,500 miles of track in 1872 to 1,600 miles in 1875.Kleppner, Paul \\"The Greenback and Prohibition Parties,\\" in Arthur M. Schlesinger (ed.), History of U.S. Political Parties: Volume II, 1860‚Äì1910, The Gilded Age of Politics. New York: Chelsea House/R.R. Bowker Co., 1973; pg. 1556. Approximately 18,000 businesses failed between 1873, and in 1875, production in iron and steel alone dropped as much as 45%, and a million or more lost their jobs. In 1876 alone, 76 railroad companies went bankrupt or entered receivership. The resulting public dissatisfaction erupted July 14, 1877 in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and spread to Maryland, New York, Illinois, Missouri and Pennsylvania.Molloy, Scott, \\"Book Review: Streets, Railroads, and the Great Strike of 1877 By Stowell, David O.\\", Technology and Culture 41.3 (2000) 636‚Äì638, via Project MUSE, accessed 20 May 2016 Violence broke out in Pittsburgh, and between July 21 and 22, 40 were killed and more than a 1,000 rail cars and 100 engines were destroyed. Another 16 were killed in an uprising in Shamokin, Pennsylvania, and strikers set fire to much of central Philadelphia in disturbances there. =Scranton= In 1874 mine owners reduced workers' wages by ten percent. Efforts to rouse a strike in response were fruitless. The next two years saw the mines run on two-thirds time, and another wage reduction of fifteen percent was made in 1876. Again, efforts to organize a strike were ineffective. By the summer of 1877 tensions were high as news spread of the violence in industrial centers across Pennsylvania and the nation. Making matters worse, the local mining companies had again reduced wages, and railroad and industry owners imposed similar cuts for rail and manufacturing workers. As one observer stated \\"the great trouble here in Scranton is our population, an excess of miners for the work to be done.\\" Events of 23‚Äì25 July Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map On July 23, the workers of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in Scranton proposed that their wages be restored to that prior to the recently imposed 10% reduction. On July 24 at 12:00 P.M., 1,000 employees of the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company, unaffiliated with the railroad, peacefully walked out due to their own wage reduction. The railroad workers struck at 6:00 P.M. that same day. The railroad strike carried implications for the remainder of local industry, as large amounts of goods could not be transported in or out of the city without the use of rail. As one man said, \\"If the coal trains shall cease to carry the coal to market, the mining of coal must cease.\\" The strikers allowed some passenger trains to reach their destinations. They did not, however, allow mail to enter the city. The strikers met that night at Father Matthew Hall, and agreed to \\"Be in favor of maintaining the peace and quiet of the city in every emergency.\\" Mayor Robert H. McKune issued a proclamation, urging \\"all good citizens to use their best efforts to preserve peace and uphold the law,\\" and to \\"abstain from all excited discussion of the prominent question of the day.\\" Referring to the recent violence in Pittsburgh, he concluded: fireman on stopped D&L; train > Every taxpayer will realize that any destruction of property will have to be > paid for by the city, and would by so much increase the burden of taxation. > In one day Pittsburgh has put upon herself a load that her taxpayers will > struggle under for years. I again earnestly urge upon men of all classes in > our city the necessity of sober, careful thought and the criminal folly of > any precipitate action. On July 25 The New York Times reported that a general strike had taken place in Scranton. A committee representing the miners called a meeting with W. R. Storrs, coal superintendent. They demanded higher wages, and vowed not to return to work, even if the railroad workers abandoned their strike. The brakemen, firemen and others joined, and every industry in the city was halted with the exception of the Pennsylvania Coal Company. The railway strikers held a mass meeting and resolved to demand a 25 percent increase in wages, \\"in order to supply ourselves and our little ones with the necessaries of life.\\" General Manager William Walker Scranton replied that same day, insisting that \\"nothing in the world would give me more pleasure,\\" but continued: > with the present frightfully low prices of iron and steel rails it is > utterly impossible for us to advance wages at all ...

I > assure you when prices will warrant it we shall be very glad to pay wages in > proportion. Events of 26‚Äì30 July Blast furnaces of Lackawanna Iron and Coal On the morning of July 26, Mayor McKune proposed organizing a group of armed special police to help maintain order in the city. At the time the local militia were stationed across the state in response to railway strike-related struggles occurring in Altoona, Harrisburg, and Pittsburgh. The police group was later renamed as the \\"Scranton Citizens' Corps,\\" and included 116 members. Mayor McKune met on July 27 with representatives of the Brotherhood of Trainmen. Following a meeting of the railway strikers, the firemen and brakemen agreed to return to work at their previous wages. Shortly thereafter, the mill workers returned to work, with assurances from W. W. Scranton. The miners, however, denounced the concession and resolved to continue the strike. The Citizens' Corps assembled in the Forest & Stream Sportsman's Club and elected officers, including Ezra H. Ripple as their captain. Ripple obtained the approval of General Osbourne, the commander of the Pennsylvania National Guard, to procure arms for the company. Within three days, they acquired 350 guns as well as ammunition. Ezra H. Ripple Rumors spread that the strike was weakening. Volunteers and others not connected with the miners association took over the mine pumps, which had been abandoned by the miners, in order to prevent flooding of the tunnels. There were minor acts of violence. The Citizens' Corps prepared for a possible armed confrontation, drilled by those of its members who were Civil War veterans. The group used the mine company store owned by W. W. Scranton as their headquarters, after vacating two other locations because owners feared the presence of the group would attract violence. A dispatch from Scranton on July 29 summarized the current state of things: > The entire Lackawanna region is idle. Week before last this region sent > nearly 150,000 tons of coal to market. Last week it did not send any ... The > situation here is absolutely painful, and there is no knowing what moment an > outbreak will occur. On July 30, due to the efforts of Mayor McKune, who assured the strikers that railway traffic would resume even if it meant enforcement by troops, the strikers from the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad returned to work at their old wages. Telegrams were sent to New York City and Binghamton stating, \\"all was going to be right again\\". The miners denounced the capitulation of the railway workers. Governor John F. Hartranft, informed of the situation by the Mayor, traveled from Harrisburg to Scranton with a force of militiamen and regulars. Some men, termed black-legs, began to flout the strike and return to work in secret. Events of August 1st Attack upon Mayor McKune. Father Dunn is seen on the left attempting to restrain members of the mob. On August 1, as many as 5,000 strikers converged on an open space between a hill and the city's iron mills at 8:00 a.m. They censured those in the companies who had returned openly to work, as well those working in secret. During the meeting, an activist showed a forged letter claiming that Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company would reduce wages to $0.35 per day. W. W. Scranton, manager of the company, later denied this, but the rumor spurred an angry protest. Men yelled, \\"Go for the shops!,\\" and the crowd moved against the Lackawanna Iron and Coal facilities. They routed other workers and injured some. In response, W. W. Scranton (along with First Sergeant Bartholomew, as Captain Ripple was out of town) led an assembly of his own employees and the Citizens' Corps. The Mayor confronted the crowd and urged them to halt, but was struck by a man, knocked down, and badly injured. Cries went up from the crowd, \\"The Mayor is killed!\\" He escaped however, aided by Father Dunn, who was carried away by the throng. Rioters attacking a citizen W. W. Scranton's assembly met with the group near Washington Ave, with Bartholomew passing into the crowd along with those following him. As they went they were assailed with jeers of \\"See the damn vigilantes! We'll take their guns!\\" Several were struck and knocked down by stones and clubs, with shouts of \\"Go for their guns, they have only blank cartridges; kill the sons-of-bitches.\\" Pistols were fired and one of the posse was wounded in the knee. An order was given to fire, though it's doubtful it was heard, and three volleys were released into the crowd. which was quickly dispersed, leaving four dead or dying. Estimates of the wounded vary from 16 to 54. Father Dunn returned to comfort the mortally wounded. Over 200 members of the Citizens' Corps were mustered and posted as guards along the streets. At 11:30 AM Mayor McKune issued the following proclamation: > I hereby order all places of business to be immediately closed and all good > citizens to hold themselves in readiness to assemble at my headquarters, at > the office of the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company, upon a signal of four > long whistles from the gong at the blast furnaces. He also wired the Governor, who informed that the National Guard brigade from Philadelphia, which had been on the way home from quelling riots in Pittsburgh, had been diverted and were en route to Scranton. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Position of the Citizens' Corps when the battle began, ‚Ä† represents position and direction of mob  General position of the column at the close of battle, ‚àµ represents position of bodies } The night passed relatively quietly. Two spies were apprehended hiding in a lumber box wagon, attempting to ascertain the strength and activity of the Corps. They were questioned and released with assurances that the Corps was well prepared for any attack. In the early morning an attack was attempted on W. W. Scranton's residence, but was averted by the patrols that had been dispatched. Conclusion and aftermath Gov Hartranft's headquarters in a Pennsylvania Railroad car On August 2 as many as 3,000 troops of the Pennsylvania National Guard First Division arrived from Pittsburgh under the command of Major General Robert Brinton, and imposed martial law. The troops had arrested an estimated 70 activists en route, and forced those apprehended to repair places where the railroad tracks between the cities had been destroyed. The Miner's Executive Committee opened a store for families, stocked by the donations of local businessmen and farmers, to relieve those who were suffering as negotiations to end the strike continued. A piece appeared in the newspaper accusing W.W. Scranton and the men of the Corps of murder. This prompted a meeting of local businessmen at the Anthracite Club, which resolved that the men of the Corps should be commended for their \\"courageous efforts\\" in dispersing the mob and averting calamity, and that they would \\"stand shoulder and purse if need be in their defense.\\" Governor Hartranft arrived in the city along with his staff and 800 men of the Pennsylvania National Guard Second Division, under the command of General Henry S. Huidekoper. W. W. Scranton wrote August 3 to the Philadelphia Times: > The sullen determination of the strikers in the recent struggle is shown > most forcibly by the fact that despite the powerful protection now here for > those who desire to pursue their peaceful avocations, none of the miners > have returned to work, and the mine pumps are still worked by the bosses and > clerks in the employ of the companies ... They will be peaceable while the > soldiers are here, but when they go away, they will have many a grievance to > redress from their standpoint. Gov. Hartranft The Pennsylvania State forces were joined on August 6 by seven companies of United States Regulars under Lieutenant Colonel Brennan, and on August 9 by the Third United States Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Henry Marrow. On August 10, General Huidekoper and his state forces departed. By October 8, some of the miners of the Pennsylvania Coal Company, who were forced to join the strike by the actions of that July, resolved to return to work, but were prevented two days later when the only line of transportation for their coal was burned by the remaining strikers. By this point \\"outrages\\" were being committed on a daily basis: > Placing obstructions upon the railroads, burning buildings, firing upon > watchmen and pump engineers at the mines, and the robbing of arms in the > neighborhood. On October 11, W. W. Scranton convinced some to return to work in the Pine Brook mine, and posted a notice that any miner who did not return to work the following day would no longer by employed by the company. Many did, and worked under guard of two companies of soldiers. That evening word came that a mob of some 500 were approaching the city with intent to \\"fix the black legs\\" (strikebreakers) at Pine Brook. Men of the guard were assembled at the mine and stood guard till morning. Every night following the 12th, at the request of the mayor, a 40-man garrison stood at the ready. On October 16 the miners held a meeting and unanimously voted to return to work. They did so beginning the next day, having won nothing in concessions.Federal Writer's Project, Pennsylvania: A Guide to the Keystone State, 1940. On October 19, the Governor advised President Rutherford B. Hayes that the federal troops could be withdrawn. The Thirteenth Infantry departed the city on October 31, and Colonel Hartley's temporary forces departed in November 1877. =Criminal charges= On August 8, a coroner's jury indicted 22 members of the Citizens' Corps on charges of Willful Murder. The arrest warrants were placed in the custody of constables, with orders to execute them. Some of the suspects may not have been present at the time that strikers were killed. General Huidekoper dispatched troops to take control of the prisoners. This was done primarily to ensure the safety of the men, as it was believed that those who had been in the mob, and compatriots of those slain, intended to do them harm. As W. W. Scranton wrote of the situation: > They hold that we are guilty of murder, and with their aldermanic jury's > verdict to back them, they would hold a court of Judge Lynch and hang the > unfortunate one of us who got into their clutches without an hour's delay, > providing they didn't first tear him to pieces ... The accused were transferred to the custody of the mayor and sheriff and taken by train to appear before the court in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the county seat of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. At the time, it included the area of Lackawanna County, which was not organized until October 1878.Bradsby, Henry C. History of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, Volume 1, 1893, Pages 232‚Äì233 Transportation by wagon was believed to be too dangerous, and would be vulnerable to attack. Again, as W. W. Scranton phrased it, \\"the whole neighborhood is filled with Molly Maguires.\\" Each man was subsequently released August 10 on $3,000 bail. The charge of murder was later amended to manslaughter by the grand jury indictment. The trial was convened November 26 under Judge Harding, with the widow of Patrick Langan, one of those slain on August 1, named as prosecutor. Of the 20 subpoenaed by the prosecution to bear witness to the peaceful nature of the protest, only six appeared to testify. Three admitted to seeing violence committed by the mob prior to the shooting. Many more testified on behalf of the accused. In his closing remarks for the defense, Stanley Woodward concluded: > We therefore hold that there was a riot, and that these men here charged > were in the full heroic performance of their duties as citizens when this > unfortunate event occurred. But the blood of these victims must be upon > their own heads. That day the jury returned verdicts of not guilty on all charges. Some of the prominent strikers were also arrested, but none was sentenced to punishment. =Libel suits= W. W. Scranton filed libel suits in 1879 against Aaron Augustus Chase, editor of the Scranton Daily Times (now the Times-Tribune), and state Judge William Stanton. The suits were related to \\"inflammatory articles\\" published in August 1878 in the Scranton Times and Labor Advocate, charging W. W. Scranton with the \\"crime of murder\\" during the 1877 strike. These articles were published during a period of intense lobbying in Pennsylvania to organize an independent Lackawanna County and designate the city of Scranton as its county seat. (The new county was chartered by October 1878.) Stanton had been sitting judge in 1877 and was arrested for libel in the Scranton case after being implicated by witnesses; he was alleged to have written an \\"incendiary\\" piece in the Advocate, \\"calculated to incite the killing of Mr. Scranton\\". Two separate trials were held: in September 1879 Chase was found guilty and sentenced to a $200 fine and 30 days imprisonment. Stanton was acquitted in his own trial that month. He had been forced to resign from the judgeship in February 1879.Wyoming Historical and Geological Society, Annual Meeting Proceedings, 1919, page 174George D. Wolf, William Warren Scranton: Pennsylvania Statesman, 1981, page 11 Legacy According to Azzarelli, two events stand out in Scranton's labor history: the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 and the 1902 Anthracite Strike. In 2008 the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission placed a historical marker commemorating the 1877 strike in Scranton. The inscription reads: > A riot occurred here on August 1, 1877, in which armed citizens fired upon > strikers, killing four. Many were injured, including Scranton's mayor. As in > numerous US cities, this labor unrest was a result of the US depression of > 1873 and a nationwide railroad strike in 1877. =Reformation of the Citizens' Corps= Following the uprising, prominent figures in Scranton began advocating for a permanent militia, and within a week nearly a thousand dollars were raised to this effect. On August 8 a meeting was held and it was decided to form a four company battalion, pending approval of the governor and adjutant general. On August 23 a piece ran in The Scranton Republican announcing that the four companies had been formed, and would muster on September 11 for inspection by the governor. In 1878 the Pennsylvania legislature organized the group as the Thirteenth Regiment, Third Brigade, Pennsylvania National Guard. The brigade went on to see action in three other major strikes. Interpretation Armory of the Scranton City Guard in 1878 Opinions differ on the root cause of the strike and ensuing violence, and what persons or groups should shoulder the blame. Historians Hitchcock and Downs emphasized the far-reaching effects of the ongoing depression, inflation, rapidly increasing commodity prices, and mass unemployment, as well as the failure of the strikers to appreciate that these conditions affected the employer as well as the employee. > Evidently the great mass of laboring men failed to comprehend the situation. > Too much then, as now, capital was their enemy, not their friend. Too much > then, as now, in their way of thinking, there was no limit to the ability of > capital. They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material > and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And > if a few more intelligent did see these things the pressure of hungry wives > and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go along on anything > that offered a shadow of relief. They go on to suggest that some unknown number of those participating in the ensuing riot may have traveled to Scranton expressly for that purpose, and not in support of the strikers or their objectives. Historian Michael A. Bellesiles suggested that violence became a type of corporate tool rather than a civic last resort: \\"management consistently refused to negotiate in any way with their workers and relied entirely on military force to settle the contest.\\" He notes a letter in which W.W. Scranton wrote to a friend, \\"I trust when the troops come,--if they ever get here,--that we may have a conflict, in which the mob shall be completely worsted. In no other way will the thing end with any security for property in the future.\\" Stepenoff writes of organized labor's \\"triumph\\" in the 1878 Scranton mayoral election, and the efforts of then Mayor Terrence Powderly, national leader of the Knights of Labor, to reorganize the police force, \\"that had disgraced itself in 1877 during a strike of anthracite miners in the Scranton area.\\" In contrast, Logan, who was present as events unfolded, dedicates his book on the topic to the \\"patriotic young men, who had wisdom to discern the city's danger, and the patient courage to provide for its defense.\\" See also Notes References Further reading * External links * \\"About The Labor Advocate.

The focus of research on female correctional officers has mostly been comparatively discussing the male officers' experience versus the female officer's experience. A number of studies are extensions of interviews or surveys solely of corrections staff and commonly emphasize employment opportunities and working conditions with an inclusion of legal and social obstacles, such as differing types of discrimination, that female officers face on a regular basis, in their respective field. Increased interest in the distinction of gender for workers in correctional facilities has some relevance to the shift in this occupation being predominantly male-dominated to, in some cases, being more female-dominated. The increase in the number of females working in this field is mainly due to helping alleviate staff shortages and providing women seeking employment with more opportunities to work in the correctional system.  History  For a long time, a majority of female correctional officers were working exclusively with female inmates due to the work of Elizabeth Fry and other rehabilitation volunteers in the early 1800s in London. These volunteer were religious, conservative women with comfortable economic backgrounds, who isolated themselves from men in order to provide female convicts with a safe environment to feel comfortable in. Mary Weed was the first female warden in 1793. Shortly after this time, the first female correctional officer was appointed in America in 1822.  Experiences and Discrimination in the Workplace  Holistically, the concept of women working in the correctional work space is perceived negatively by society. Generalized theories held by the public and politicians make powerful resistance for these perceptions to change. These conceptions range from women being useless in disrupting inmate altercations due to their smaller size in comparison to men, less mental capability of handling hardships of the male- dominated correctional field, coercion into relationships with other male or female inmates or fellow guards, causing additional problems for the other staff members. Female correctional officers have different experiences working in correctional prison facilities depending on policies and their relationships in the workplace. = Superior-to-Guard = Though correctional officers have limited interactions with their superiors as opposed to their coworkers, they still have a huge effect on their experiences. The assignments that superiors give out are usually gendered, and show a clear division between men's work and women's work in the facility. Since privacy rights place restrictions on certain assignments women are allowed to do in male prisons, this can be used as an excuse for limitations in women's workload and deployment. Britton found that discretion in distribution of work for prison officers was greater in state versus federal prisons, because state officials make significant decisions rather than elected representatives. Female prison officers are less likely to be assigned to jobs that were considered unsafe because of the influence of the association of masculinity with physical stature. These positions typically involve a lot of contact with inmates who were perceived as more violent than others. Instead female officers can be assigned to visitation and control areas, or even assigned secretarial desk- jobs. While some female officers accept this \\"protection\\", others resent it and realize that they commonly receive weaker evaluations and less opportunities for upward mobility and promotion in the correctional field. = Guard-to-Guard = Female corrections officers experience more hostility from male coworkers than they do from male prisoners. Many researchers have found that male officers are most concerned over the issue of female officers becoming too friendly with inmates, causing them to treat these officers poorly. Male officers fear that female officers will threaten the security of their facility by having inappropriate relations with inmates, or gather unfair promotions by granting sexual favors to their superiors. Female correctional staff is viewed as \\"tokens, sex objects and as inferior\\" by their male coworkers. When these women work in an all-male maximum security setting, this attitude increases substantially, giving room for more discrimination from male correctional officers to their female counterparts. In similar research, female officers were more inclined to make complaints about coworkers as opposed to the inmates that they guarded, and the highest percentage of problem complaints were towards male officers of comparable rank and position. This, as a result, causes a gender-like tolerance dynamic, where female corrections staff are much more tolerant of their own gender of officers than male officers in the same institution and vice versa. = Inmate-to-Guard = Title VII allows female correctional officers to supervise both male and female inmates, unless they are nude for prolonged periods of time, or have to come in contact with male genitalia. Inmates have varying levels of respect and receptiveness for their female guards. Depending on how the female guard is perceived by the group of inmates, they are either respected or disrespected as a whole. Although some inmates may respect their female guards, some do wish that female guards were not present to tempt their sexual desires. There are also inmates that feel as though females working in correctional facilities should be kept to a minimum because their positive impact is diminished by their potential to create conflict (usually sexual). Men in the incarceration system feel shameful and vulnerable, and they feel that one way to reduce these negative feeling surrounding their current state, female guarding should be kept to a minimum, as female guards can sometimes be seen as threatening to the manhood of male inmates. With more contact, inmate perceptions of officers can either be more positive or more negative. If offenders are required to interact appropriately and respectfully with the women guarding them, they have more potential to see females in power more confidently and have better attitudes towards them. Inmates may be able to stop viewing female correctional officers as weak and incapable of doing their jobs effectively, and see them, instead, as strong women. As much as privacy and sexual assault can be cause for concern, a majority of inmates (interviewed for a study) that had been supervised by a female indicated little sexual temptation or frustration, no invasion of privacy, and no resentment or stripping of manhood from having to take orders from female guards. Since women are seen as \\"softer\\" in demeanor and intervention style than men, many inmates actually prefer female guards over their male counterparts. Depending on the nature of the guard-to-inmate interactions, there can be negative repercussions as well. If the interaction is not a positive one, it may cause more tension between them. Older inmates also find frustration in female guarding, because they are not used to it. Female officer number counts are on the rise, but they were not always that way. The elder inmates tend to resent changes made to the gender of the staff members in their facilities. Inmate perceptions of female officers are dependent on the length of their sentencing, as well. Among minimum, medium, and maximum custody inmates, inmates with shorter sentences (usually minimum sentences) are more likely to have negative perceptions about the competency and ability of female officers to do their job effectively and efficiently than medium and maximum- sentenced inmates. These findings may be due to the fact that inmates with longer sentences have been or will be in prison for a longer period of time with little-to-no outside interactions, therefore, they appreciate female interactions more. The race of the inmates may be relevant to whether or not they appreciate the presence of female officers in correctional facilities. Close-custody inmates, who are usually non-white, enjoy and welcome female presence and are pleased with their competency levels and how well they do their jobs. One explanation is that men of color in the incarceration system have a higher prevalence of being raised by a strong female disciplinarian over a male figure. Because of this, they may be more likely to respect a female authority figure. = Harassment = Issues of harassment have high prevalence in correctional facilities. Female officers are viewed as more susceptible than men to be coerced into inappropriate relationships with prisoners, causing additional problems for themselves, inmates, and other staff members. In opposition to their male counterparts, these women are still covered by Title VIII in order to protect them from workplace opportunity discrimination, harassment, and abuse in the correctional setting. Many inmates still \\"haze\\" new female officers by staring at them in uncomfortable ways for prolonged periods of time and making suggestive remarks and expressions. Women officers usually restrain from disclosing information about the harassment they face in fear of its effects on the environment of their workplace or its repercussions on their job. Being a correctional officer puts females in a position of power as well as vulnerability, making them more inclined to abuse that power. In addition to being seen as victims of harassment, they are also seen as perpetrators as well. Female correctional officers make up about sixty-one percent of sexual misconduct among staff and twenty-one percent of staff harassment. There are also reports stating that sixty-nine percent of jail and prison inmates report victimization with female staff members as the perpetrators.  Coping Strategies  = Presentation of Self = Constructed situation-specific gender roles form salient role identity, by which individuals are perceived and reacted to. Attractiveness is no marker for whether or not female presence in correctional facilities is appreciated. Female prison officers are known to use different strategies to present themselves in ways that can be beneficial or perhaps sometimes detrimental to the receptiveness of their coworkers and/or their inmates as well.  Normative-feminine presentation  The normative-feminine presentation is the best received presentation out of the various that are used. This presentation is the stereotypically feminine type that women are expected to present. Those who actively participate in this presentation of self are generally less aggressive, have longer hair, smile more often, have softer voices, are more nurturing and have less-muscled bodies. They handle altercations in a calmer, more relaxed fashion as well. They usually see common, positive results amongst their inmates. Depending on the guard, they can attract inmates in a negative manner as well. Female guards may not feel comfortable with the interactions that they have with other inmates at times, as well as they may not feel comfortable with the way any of their interactions may be perceived when performing this way. It also has potential to cause problems with other male guards, because they do not appreciate \\"prisoner-friendly\\" guards, in fear that they are being too soft, ruining the masculine, dominant dynamic of the prisons. This may cause male guards to turn against these types of female guards, or treat them disrespectfully. As a result, the more alienated female guards feel, the more likely that they will take part in inappropriate relations with inmates, become hyper-masculine, or quit. There are many benefits to this presentation style, some guards may feel uncomfortable displaying themselves this way and end up leaving their facility. = Hyper-masculine presentation = Hyper-masculinity is a different type of presentation of female prison guards. Characteristics of the females that present this way are unbending, unapproachable, hardcore, aggressive, and controlling. Since masculine norms of prison require both male guards and male inmates to appear tough and aggressive, this can cause stress in inmate perception of guards presenting in this manner. Inmates either view these women as \\"man haters\\" who have been done wrong by men, thus seeking revenge on male prisoners, or the lesbian enemies of the prison because of their short, cropped hairstyles and their demeanors. This type of self- presentation is usually not received in the best way by the inmates and usually causes tension and hostility between them and the female guards. Though female officers may be drawn to this style of presentation in efforts to disguise their femininity (perceived as weak), it has potential to backfire, being that the negative outcomes outweigh the scarce positives. = Humor = Humor is found to be the most likely coping mechanism used by older officers to make light of the inmates' situations or their own. They use humor and nonchalance as a coping mechanism for dealing with the controversial things they hear and see while working in the correctional facilities. Many use this to prevent pondering too hardly on each situation they face on an everyday basis. Many of the female officers who use humor to cope are either continuing to work despite their misery or trying to deal with their situation differently. These officers were also more likely to be older and have been working in the correctional institution for a more substantial amount of time. = Alcohol and Drug Usage = Correctional officers may turn to drugs and alcohol to temporarily relieve stress and pressures of their workplace. Though female officers are less likely to abuse these substances than their male counterparts, they still take part in these activities in hopes to relieve the physiological effects of correctional officer burnout (headaches, insomnia, back aches, etc.). These bodily effects are psychosomatic, but were treated by the officers with drugs and alcohol. Substance abuse is usually triggered by low recognition of their hard work by their facility and low social connectivity or verbal abuse from fellow correctional staff, which females receive the most of in the corrections field. Women who have multiple roles and responsibilities outside of their facilities are less likely to abuse drugs and alcohol as a coping strategy for stress reduction. = Religion = One way that female correctional officers find success in coping with stress is religion. Religious techniques can help alleviate stress and emotional exhaustion from occupational pressures. Since proper social interaction is necessary for human survival, simply being a part of religious groups help reduce stress and meet basic social needs. For those correctional officers who had a spouse practicing any religion, there were positive effects on their overall levels of stress.  Limitations  Though many women become prison officers for a multitude of reasons, including flexible hours, decent benefits, and job security, there are limitations that come with working in corrections as well. = Privacy of Inmates = In a context where a vast majority of prisoners (or even all) are male, hiring women to watch male prisoners can be seen as problematic. Many actions performed in correctional facilities, such as shower patrol, strip searches, and many other normal prison activities, are seen as limitations for female workers. Since female guards are not allowed to be in contact with nude, male inmates or their genitalia, this can put pressure on effective security. Masturbation, using the bathroom, and changing clothes are public spectacles, because doors are not commonly installed on inmates' bathrooms and rooms. As a result, inmate privacy suffers for it. Close proximity to inmates during these instances is shame-inducing for them and can add various levels of frustration and powerlessness to what was already a shameful and powerless situation (being in prison). Problems with female security may range from common privacy to invasion of privacy, and further with experiences of sexual assault from the guard or the inmates. = Relationship Status = Relationships for female correctional officers have potential limits. Women working in corrections are less likely to be married during that time; they are more likely to be single. A lot of these women are usually also single parents, raising children on their own. Some of the women who worked in correctional facilities but ended up leaving are seen coming back to visit inmates with whom they are perceived to have been having relations with.  Reality  There are many different misconceptions of women working as correctional officers, some of the most common being veritably inaccurate. There is much concern regarding the female officer's ability to perform during acts of violence. While working in such an institution, a female officer may come into contact with danger while doing bodily searches on inmates, becoming the physical mediator between inmate fights, and observing inmate areas for illegal items. While female correctional officers are usually perceived to be vulnerable and gullible, they are actually \\"conned\\" less than their male counterparts. Because inmates usually feel more comfortable being honest and open with women due to common gender expectations, they feel less inclined to lie or con their way out of situations in fear of being harshly reprimanded. In addition, women corrections officers possess a substantial amount of confidence in their job performance. They are actually perceived to create a more positive, relaxed atmosphere for their inmates depending on how they treat them.

Pa. 1915), was a civil antitrust prosecution overlapping to some extent with the issues in the decision in the Supreme Court's Motion Picture Patents case. After the trial court found that the defendants violated ¬ß¬ß 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act by establishing control over \\"trade in films, cameras, projecting machines, and other accessories of the motion picture business,\\" by their patent licensing practices and other conduct, they appealed to the Supreme Court. After the Supreme Court's 1917 decision in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Manufacturing Co.,. however, the parties dismissed the appeal by stipulation (mutual agreement) in 1918' that decision had made the defendants' appeal futile.. Background The Edison Trust's control of the Latham Loop Patent gave it domination over the motion picture industry Thomas Edison developed and patented the first commercial motion picture camera and player (projector) in the United States (in Europe a handful of inventors had already developed and patented similar but different technologyhttps://www.asktherightquestion.org/analyzing-film-year-1915-louis- le-prince-eadweard-muybridge-lumiere-brothers-kinetoscope-movies-films-cinema- history-moving-images/), and others followed in his steps, leading to extensive rivalry and patent litigation. In December 1908, Edison formed a combination of his Edison Manufacturing Company and nine other owners of film- related patents: the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC), also known as the Motion Picture Patents Trust, or the Edison Trust.The initial members of Edison's trust were Vitagraph, Biograph Company, Essanay, Selig Polyscope Company, Lubin, and Kalem; and the French companies Path√©, M√©li√®s, and Gaumont. Eastman Kodak, the film stock manufacturer, subsequently joined. The Trust controlled major patents dominating motion picture technology, including patents covering film stock, cameras, and projectors‚Äîincluding the so-called Latham loop patent (U.S. Pat. No. 707,934), a key feature of virtually all motion picture cameras then in use. Using the combined patent rights, the MPPC was able to exact high fees from their competitors for their use of film stock, cameras, and projectors. \\"The MPPC quickly became a force to be reckoned with, frequently and strenuously asserting its patent rights against independent movie producers through litigation.\\" Between 1909 and 1918, MPCC brought about 40 patent infringement suits against competitors to maintain its control over the industry.Alexandra Gil, Breaking the Studios: Antitrust and the Motion Picture Industry, 3 N.Y.U. 83, 91‚Äì92 (2008). Initially, the federal courts refused to consider antitrust violation as a defense to a patent infringement charge. For example, in March 1910, in two cases in the Southern District of New York, the court held that \\"the charge, if established, that the complainant is itself, or is a member of, a combination in violation of the federal anti-trust statute, is not a defense available in an action for the infringement of a patent\\".Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Laemmle, 178 F. 104, 105 (S.D.N.Y 1910). In a third case later that year, the court held: \\"Such a suit [for patent infringement] is not based on contract, but on tort, and, of course, the fact that a man has entered into some illegal contract does not authorize others to injure him with impunity.\\"Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Ullman, 186 F. 174, 175 (S.D.N.Y. 1910). See also Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Independent Moving Pictures Co. of America, 200 F. 411 (2d Cir. 1912) (per curiam). The Trust established a monopoly on all aspects of the motion picture business. Eastman Kodak, a member of the Trust, owned the patent on raw film stock and it agreed to only sell film stock only to other members.In 1911, however, Kodak broke ranks and began to sell generally to independents. The camera patents prevented companies, not members of or licensed by the Trust, from making films. The projector patents enabled the Trust to require distributors and theaters to screen only the Trust members' films. In addition, the Trust established uniform prices for renting films to theaters. While the patents were the main effective to establish industry control, in some instances the Trust made use of hired thugs and mob connections to violently disrupt productions that were not licensed by the Trust.Steven Bach, 30 (1999). In August 1912, the Department of Justice brought an antitrust prosecution against the members of the Trust in the federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Ruling of district court The defendants made two principal defense arguments. The first was that the \\"gravamen of the offense may be gathered from the general summary that it is a conspiracy to drive from the field all other traders in the things which make possible the practice of the motion picture art, and to monopolize to themselves that trade, and through this the practice of the art itself.\\" The defendants argued that they were not engaged in trade or commerce, to which the antitrust laws are limited: \\"The control, with the seeking of which the defendants are charged, is therefore the control of an art, and not of trade, or of anything which is the subject of commerce, or can be brought within the laws relating thereto.\\"225 F. at 802-03. The court brushed the argument aside. It said that \\"the charge made against these defendants is that, whatever may have been their final purpose with respect to the control of the art, what they combined to do, and have done, is to restrain trade or commerce in these films, which are articles of trade and the subject of large interstate transactions, in which the defendants had part.\\"225 F. at 803. The court turned to the main defense‚Äîthat the defendants' ownership of patent rights relieves them of antitrust liability. The court conceded: > The [patentee's exclusive] right to sell carries with it the right to > withhold from sale, or to part with the possession without parting with the > ownership. It also confers the right to impose reasonable and legal > conditions of bailment or sale \\"restricting the terms upon which the > [patented] article may be used and the price to be demanded therefor.\\" All > these propositions are clear, and have been expressly held to be the law.225 > F. at 805. But: \\"The limitation that the terms must be legal should, however, not be lost sight of.\\" For example, a post-sale restriction on price, \\"which will follow the article through successive sales, will not be upheld.\\" While the patent and antitrust laws must be accommodated to one another, \\"it cannot be that the grant of a patent right confers a license to do that which the law condemns.\\" A patentee may simply enforce his right to exclude infringement, but he must not use his patent \\"as a weapon to disable a rival contestant, or to drive him from the field,\\" for \\"he cannot justify such use.\\" The court said, \\"As a conclusion to the whole discussion, we deem the Bath Tub Case to be decisive of the principle contended for by the United States.\\" In that case, the Supreme Court found that the defendants' conduct \\"transcended what was necessary to protect the use of the patent or the monopoly which the law conferred upon it. They passed to the purpose and accomplished a restraint of trade condemned by the Sherman law.\\" They did so because they \\"combined the manufacturers and jobbers\\" to form a conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act. That brought the court \\"to the consideration of the special facts of this case.\\"225 F. at 807. The court said it would assume that the defendants had \\"no purpose to offend against or to evade the law, and that their intentions were as beneficent and have resulted in an much good to the patronage of the art as is claimed, and that this good bears a fair relation to the profits received by them.\\" That is irrelevant because, as the Supreme Court said in the Bathtub Case, \\"the law is its own measure of right and wrong.\\" The law is also: > the judge of whether a transaction is of the character which it condemns. > If, in the judgment of the law, a contract or co-operating agreement is such > as to work an undue and unreasonable restraint of trade, and through such > restraint to monopolize trade or any part of it, the judgment is one of > condemnation, no matter how innocent or otherwise praiseworthy the motives > of those who had part in it.225 F. at 808. The court then reviewed the defendants' course of conduct\\" Shortly after the formation of the MPPC in 1908, it licensed 116 jobbers to distribute the members' films to theaters. Within a short time, however, the MPPC decided to absorb this part of the trade, and the General Film Company was formed to take over the business of distribution, and 115 of the 116 jobbers were eliminated. Lists of exchanges and of theaters were prepared, and then MPPC permitted no exchange to have films, and no theater to exhibit them, unless all of the defendants consented. No one could be on the approved list except such as bought all supplies from the defendants, and any who dealt with their competitors was dropped. Every theater was required to pay a royalty for the use of a projecting machine, even when the machine had been owned by the exhibitor before the MPPC combination was formed. The defendants did not merely combine to protect their patents against infringement. Their efforts: > went far beyond the fair and normal possible scope of any efforts to protect > such rights, and that as a direct and intended result of such undue and > unreasonable restrictions the defendants have monopolized a large part of > the interstate trade and commerce in films, cameras, projecting machines, > and other articles of commerce accessory to the motion picture business.225 > F. at 809‚Äì11. The court therefore concluded: > [T]he contracts enumerated in the petition, and the combination there > described, were a conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the > several states and with foreign nations, and were and are illegal, and that > the defendants and each of them . . . have attempted to monopolize, and have > monopolized, and have combined and conspired, among themselves and with each > other, to monopolize, a part of the trade or commerce . . . consisting of > the trade in films, cameras, projecting machines, and other accessories of > the motion picture business trade in films, cameras, projecting machines, > and other accessories of the motion picture business.225 F. at 811. N.Y. Times headline announcing ruling that Trust must be broken up The court then ordered that the Trust must be dissolved.Orders Movie Trust To Be Broken Up, (Oct. 2, 1915). The defendants appealed to the Supreme Court. Intervening Supreme Court Motion Picture Patents decision After the district court tried this case, several developments in case law adversely affected MPPC's position. In 1913 in Bauer & Cie. v. O'Donnell,. the Supreme Court held that a patentee could not use its patent to fix resale prices. Later, in October 1914, Congress passed the Clayton Act, making it an antitrust violation to sell goods on the condition that the buyer not deal in the goods of another seller. These were two of MPPC's practices. In addition, in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., MPPC sued a licensee, Universal, to which MPPC had sold a film projector subject to the licensee's promise that only MPPC's films would be used in the machine. Because another company's films were subsequently used with the machine, MPPC sued for patent infringement. The district court dismissed the complaint. The Second Circuit affirmed in 1916,Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 235 F. 398 (2d Cir. 1916). holding: \\"If the prohibitions of the Clayton Act mean anything at all, this case falls within them, and the restrictions as to use of films other than complainant's with the projecting machines are therefore void.\\" In 1917 the Supreme Court affirmed this ruling in Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co. Finally, in January 1918, the Latham Loop patent was held invalid, removing the keystone of MPPC's patent structure.Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Calehuff Supply Co., 248 F. 724 (E.D. Pa. 1918). These rulings made it clear that it was futile for MPPC to pursue its Supreme Court appeal of the case, and in June 1918 MPCC stipulated with the government to a dismissal of the appeal.

Such models often employ scenario analysis to investigate different assumptions about the technical and economic conditions at play. Outputs may include the system feasibility, greenhouse gas emissions, cumulative financial costs, natural resource use, and energy efficiency of the system under investigation. A wide range of techniques are employed, ranging from broadly economic to broadly engineering. Mathematical optimization is often used to determine the least-cost in some sense. Models can be international, regional, national, municipal, or stand- alone in scope. Governments maintain national energy models for energy policy development. Energy models are usually intended to contribute variously to system operations, engineering design, or energy policy development. This page concentrates on policy models. Individual building energy simulations are explicitly excluded, although they too are sometimes called energy models. IPCC-style integrated models, which also contain a representation of the world energy system and are used to examine global transformation pathways through to 2050 or 2100 are not considered here in detail. Energy modeling has increased in importance as the need for climate change mitigation has grown in importance. The energy supply sector is the largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC reports that climate change mitigation will require a fundamental transformation of the energy supply system, including the substitution of unabated (not captured by CCS) fossil fuel conversion technologies by low-GHG alternatives.  Model types  A wide variety of model types are in use. This section attempts to categorize the key types and their usage. The divisions provided are not hard and fast and mixed-paradigm models exist. In addition, the results from more general models can be used to inform the specification of more detailed models, and vice versa, thereby creating a hierarchy of models. Models may, in general, need to capture \\"complex dynamics such as: * energy system operation * technology stock turnover * technology innovation * firm and household behaviour * energy and non-energy capital investment and labour market adjustment dynamics leading to economic restructuring * infrastructure deployment and urban planning\\" Models may be limited in scope to the electricity sector or they may attempt to cover an energy system in its entirety (see below). Most energy models are used for scenario analysis. A scenario is a coherent set of assumptions about a possible system. New scenarios are tested against a baseline scenario ‚Äì normally business-as-usual (BAU) ‚Äì and the differences in outcome noted. The time horizon of the model is an important consideration. Single-year models ‚Äì set in either the present or the future (say 2050) ‚Äì assume a non-evolving capital structure and focus instead on the operational dynamics of the system. Single-year models normally embed considerable temporal (typically hourly resolution) and technical detail (such as individual generation plant and transmissions lines). Long-range models ‚Äì cast over one or more decades (from the present until say 2050) ‚Äì attempt to encapsulate the structural evolution of the system and are used to investigate capacity expansion and energy system transition issues. Models often use mathematical optimization to solve for redundancy in the specification of the system. Some of the techniques used derive from operations research. Most rely on linear programming (including mixed-integer programming), although some use nonlinear programming. Solvers may use classical or genetic optimisation, such as CMA-ES. Models may be recursive-dynamic, solving sequentially for each time interval, and thus evolving through time. Or they may be framed as a single forward-looking intertemporal problem, and thereby assume perfect foresight. Single-year engineering-based models usually attempt to minimize the short-run financial cost, while single-year market-based models use optimization to determine market clearing. Long-range models, usually spanning decades, attempt to minimize both the short and long-run costs as a single intertemporal problem. The demand-side (or end-user domain) has historically received relatively scant attention, often modeled by just a simple demand curve. End-user energy demand curves, in the short-run at least, are normally found to be highly inelastic. As intermittent energy sources and energy demand management grow in importance, models have needed to adopt an hourly temporal resolution in order to better capture their real-time dynamics. Long-range models are often limited to calculations at yearly intervals, based on typical day profiles, and are hence less suited to systems with significant variable renewable energy. Day-ahead dispatching optimization is used to aid in the planning of systems with a significant portion of intermittent energy production in which uncertainty around future energy predictions is accounted for using stochastic optimization. Implementing languages include GAMS, MathProg, MATLAB, Mathematica, Python, Pyomo, R, Fortran, Java, C, C++, and Vensim. Occasionally spreadsheets are used. As noted, IPCC-style integrated models (also known as integrated assessment models or IAM) are not considered here in any detail. Integrated models combine simplified sub-models of the world economy, agriculture and land-use, and the global climate system in addition to the world energy system. Examples include GCAM, MESSAGE, and REMIND. Published surveys on energy system modeling have focused on techniques, general classification, an overview, decentralized planning, modeling methods, renewables integration, energy efficiency policies, electric vehicle integration, international development, and the use of layered models to support climate protection policy. Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project researchers have also analyzed model typologies. A 2014 paper outlines the modeling challenges ahead as energy systems become more complex and human and social factors become increasingly relevant. = Electricity sector models = Electricity sector models are used to model electricity systems. The scope may be national or regional, depending on circumstances. For instance, given the presence of national interconnectors, the western European electricity system may be modeled in its entirety. Engineering-based models usually contain a good characterization of the technologies involved, including the high-voltage AC transmission grid where appropriate. Some models (for instance, models for Germany) may assume a single common bus or \\"copper plate\\" where the grid is strong. The demand-side in electricity sector models is typically represented by a fixed load profile. Market-based models, in addition, represent the prevailing electricity market, which may include nodal pricing. Game theory and agent-based models are used to capture and study strategic behavior within electricity markets. = Energy system models = In addition to the electricity sector, energy system models include the heat, gas, mobility, and other sectors as appropriate. Energy system models are often national in scope, but may be municipal or international. So-called top-down models are broadly economic in nature and based on either partial equilibrium or general equilibrium. General equilibrium models represent a specialized activity and require dedicated algorithms. Partial equilibrium models are more common. So- called bottom-up models capture the engineering well and often rely on techniques from operations research. Individual plants are characterized by their efficiency curves (also known as input/output relations), nameplate capacities, investment costs (capex), and operating costs (opex). Some models allow for these parameters to depend on external conditions, such as ambient temperature. Producing hybrid top-down/bottom-up models to capture both the economics and the engineering has proved challenging.  Established models  This section lists some of the major models in use. These are typically run by national governments. In a community effort, a large number of existing energy system models were collected in model fact sheets on the Open Energy Platform. = LEAP = LEAP (Long range Energy Alternatives Planning System) is a software tool for energy policy analysis and climate change mitigation assessment. LEAP was developed at the Stockholm Environment Institute's (SEI) US Center. LEAP can be used to examine city, statewide, national, and regional energy systems. LEAP is normally used for forecast studies of between 20‚Äì50 years. Most of its calculations occur at yearly intervals. LEAP allows policy analysts to create and evaluate alternative scenarios and to compare their energy requirements, social costs and benefits, and environmental impacts. = Power System Simulation = General Electric's MAPS (Multi-Area Production Simulation) is a production simulation model used by various Regional Transmission Organizations and Independent System Operators in the United States to plan for the economic impact of proposed electric transmission and generation facilities in FERC-regulated electric wholesale markets. Portions of the model may also be used for the commitment and dispatch phase (updated on 5 minute intervals) in operation of wholesale electric markets for RTO and ISO regions. ABB's PROMOD is a similar software package. These ISO and RTO regions also utilize a GE software package called MARS (Multi-Area Reliability Simulation) to ensure the power system meets reliability criteria (a loss-of- load-expectation (LOLE) of no greater than 0.1 days per year). Further, a GE software package called PSLF (Positive Sequence Load Flow) and a Siemens software package called PSSE (Power System Simulation for Engineering) analyzes load flow on the power system for short-circuits and stability during preliminary planning studies by RTOs and ISOs. = MARKAL/TIMES = MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) is an integrated energy systems modeling platform, used to analyze energy, economic, and environmental issues at the global, national, and municipal level over time-frames of up to several decades. MARKAL can be used to quantify the impacts of policy options on technology development and natural resource depletion. The software was developed by the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme (ETSAP) of the International Energy Agency (IEA) over a period of almost two decades. TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) is an evolution of MARKAL ‚Äì both energy models have many similarities. TIMES succeeded MARKAL in 2008. Both models are technology explicit, dynamic partial equilibrium models of energy markets. In both cases, the equilibrium is determined by maximizing the total consumer and producer surplus via linear programming. Both MARKAL and TIMES are written in GAMS. The TIMES model generator was also developed under the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program (ETSAP). TIMES combines two different, but complementary, systematic approaches to modeling energy ‚Äì a technical engineering approach and an economic approach. TIMES is a technology rich, bottom-up model generator, which uses linear programming to produce a least-cost energy system, optimized according to a number of user-specified constraints, over the medium to long-term. It is used for \\"the exploration of possible energy futures based on contrasted scenarios\\". , the MARKAL and TIMES model generators are in use in 177 institutions spread over 70 countries. = NEMS = NEMS (National Energy Modeling System) is a long-standing United States government policy model, run by the Department of Energy (DOE). NEMS computes equilibrium fuel prices and quantities for the US energy sector. To do so, the software iteratively solves a sequence of linear programs and nonlinear equations. NEMS has been used to explicitly model the demand-side, in particular to determine consumer technology choices in the residential and commercial building sectors. NEMS is used to produce the Annual Energy Outlook each year ‚Äì for instance in 2015.  Criticisms  Public policy energy models have been criticized for being insufficiently transparent. The source code and data sets should at least be available for peer review, if not explicitly published. To improve transparency and public acceptance, some models are undertaken as open-source software projects, often developing a diverse community as they proceed. OSeMOSYS is one such example.

Denny Jr. (1899‚Äì1959) was the long-time moderator of one of radio's first talk shows, America's Town Meeting of the Air, as well as the executive director of the League for Political Education/Town Hall, which produced the program. Denny moderated America's Town Meeting of the Air from 1935 to 1952 and had a major role in choosing weekly topics.  Biography  = Early life and education = Denny was born August 29, 1899, in Washington, North Carolina, graduating from the University of North Carolina (UNC) in 1922. = Early career and the League for Political Education = Denny was a professor of drama production at UNC from 1924‚Äì1926, and then moved to New York, working as an actor on Broadway for one season. He managed the W. B. Feakins lecture bureau for a year, and then became the director of Columbia University's Institute of Arts and Sciences from 1928‚Äì1930. In 1931, Denny became the associate director of the League for Political Education, becoming full director in 1937. = America's Town Meeting of the Air = In his role, by 1935 Denny worried that an uninformed public was bad for democracy;Overstreet, Harry A. and Bonaro W. Overstreet. Town Meeting Comes to Town. Harper and Brothers, 1938, p. 6. and that American society had become so polarized that the average person didn't listen to other points of view.Hilmes, Michele, editor. \\"NBC: America's Network.\\" University of California Press, 2007, pp. 46-47. His goal was to create a new kind of educational program, one that would be entertaining as well as mentally challenging, while exposing listeners to various perspectives on the issues of the day. He wanted to create a program that would replicate the town meetings that were held in the early days of the United States.\\"Boston Symphony Returns to the Air; Town Meetings to Be Resumed as Public Forum.\\" New York Times, November 1, 1936, Section X, p. 13. He believed that a radio town meeting could enhance the public's interest in current events. Explaining the rationale behind a radio town meeting, Denny wrote that it was \\"... a device which is designed to attract [the average American's] attention and stimulate his [sic] interest in the complex economic, social and political problems which he must have a hand in solving.\\"Denny, George V. Jr. \\"Radio Builds Democracy.\\" Journal of Educational Sociology, vol. 14, #6, February 1941, p. 377. Originally carried by the NBC Blue Network, America's Town Meeting of the Air began as a six-week experiment, and NBC itself didn't expect much from it. Broadcast live from New York City's Town Hall (the League for Political Education's headquarters), America's Town Meeting of the Air debuted on Thursday May 30, 1935, and only 18 of NBC's affiliates carried it. The topic for that first show was \\"Which Way America: Fascism, Communism, Socialism or Democracy?‚ÄùOverstreet, Harry A. and Bonaro W. Overstreet. Town Meeting Comes to Town. Harper and Brothers, 1938. As Denny had hoped, listeners not only enjoyed hearing famous newsmakers engaging in discussion but they also enjoyed hearing members of the audience challenging these newsmakers. It wasn't long before Denny was receiving fan mail: much to his surprise, his first broadcast received about 3,000 letters.Denny, p. 373. By the 1937-8 season, mail averaged between 2,000 and 4,000 letters a week, an amazing number for an educational program.Hilmes, p. 49. It also inspired listeners to form \\"listener clubs,\\" where members would listen as a group and then discuss the topic themselves.Sparling, Earl. \\"Town Meeting's On the Air Again.\\" Forum and Century, October 1939, p. 166. America's Town Meeting became so popular in the public discourse that during the late 1930s and into the early 40s, Denny wrote a monthly column for Current History magazine, in which he gave summaries of the major points made by some of his Town Meeting guests, and then gave readers news quizzes. And educators found it so useful that Denny and NBC put program listings and what the speakers had said into booklet form, which was disseminated to public school civics teachers. Over the years, America's Town Meeting became known for its interesting guests, many of whom were important newsmakers. Denny did not shy away from controversy: his panelists included Socialist presidential candidate Norman Thomas, American Communist Party leader Earl Browder, and civil libertarian Morris Ernst. The topics were meant to inspire discussion, and Denny tried to select subjects that would get people talking long after the show was over. Among them were discussions about whether America truly had freedom of the press (and whether censorship was sometimes necessary); whether the United States should enter World War II or remain neutral; and why the United States public schools weren't doing a better job.\\"Schools Are Urged to Teach Politics.\\" New York Times, February 7, 1936, p. 5.Hilmes, p. 51. But during World War II, Denny repeatedly encountered what he had most sought to avoid: angry audience members who didn't want to listen to other viewpoints and who wanted to criticize, rather than debate. Worse still, some audience members expressed isolationist and anti-Semitic views. Denny struggled to maintain the show's openness and objectivity, but it became increasingly difficult to do so.Hilmes, pp. 51-52. The 1930s were definitely the heyday of America's Town Meeting, although it remained on the air throughout the 1940s and sometimes still inspired the kinds of passionate discussions Denny had hoped for. But Town Meeting underwent a number of time changes during the 1940s. Some were the result of changes at NBC ‚Äî the network that had been called the NBC Blue Network was sold in 1943, and it first became known as the \\"Blue Network,\\" and then was re-named the American Broadcasting Company in late 1945. Some of the programs on the new network were shifted around, and not only did Town Meeting get a new timeslot‚Äîit was moved from 9:30pm to 8:30pm‚Äîbut by 1944, it even got a sponsor‚ÄîReader's Digest.\\"George V. Denny, Radio Host, Dead.\\" New York Times, November 12, 1959, p. 35. At times, the show was 60 minutes, sometimes 45 minutes and sometimes only a half- hour.Dunning, p. 30 And when television came along, interest in Denny's radio program gradually faded. Denny resigned his position at the League for Political Education (then known as Town Hall, Inc.) in 1951; by 1952, he had been replaced as moderator ‚Äî the show was finally canceled on July 1, 1956. = Later life and death = Denny, who continued to believe in educational media, joined an organization that planned international seminars, and he hoped to create an international version of Town Meeting. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage on November 11, 1959, at the age of 60.  Personal life  Denny was married to Mary Traill Yellott 12 from June 1924 until their 1943 divorce. They had three children. In April 1944 he married the former Jean Sarasy; they remained married until his death.

He won national acclaim from abolitionists for his testimony in front of the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1853 Fugitive Slave case Maxwell v. Righter. William Camp Gildersleeve was born on 6 December 1795 in Liberty County, Georgia. His parents were Renchie Norman and Rev. Cyrus Gildersleeve, Pastor of the Presbyterian Midway Church in Liberty County, and a cotton plantation owner. It was on the plantation that Gildersleeve said he developed his dislike for slavery. His parents had five other children; Cyrus, Mary, Amarinthia, Sarah, and Hannah. His mother died 15 November 1807. His father remarried on 12 May 1808 to Frances Caroline Wilkinson, who bore him seven more children; Ezra, Caroline, Francenia, Thomas, Isabella, Frances, and Ellen. Soon after, Rev. Cyrus Gildersleeve gathered his family and moved north, where he became the Pastor of a Wilkes-Barre Presbyterian Church. He purchased a house on Northampton Street in Wilkes-Barre. Another reason he made the move was so that his children could receive a better education. In 1817, William Camp Gildersleeve married Nancy Spencer Riggs, who was from Mendham, New Jersey. They had a son, Cyrus Norman, in 1819. For a time they lived in Morristown, New Jersey, but moved back to Rev. Cyrus Gildersleeve's house before 1822. From here William Camp Gildersleeve opened a dry goods store on Market Street. On 25 September 1822, William Camp Gildersleeve and his wife had a daughter, Ann Elizabeth. After she was born, William took his wife, son Cyrus Norman, and the child to a house on the corner of Franklin and Union Street, also in Wilkes-Barre. They had another daughter named Mary on 21 April 1826. Two years later, William Camp Gildersleeve purchased a new house on Franklin Street. In September 1830, his wife Nancy died. His sister, Sarah, came to take care of the children but left when she was married a few months later. After this, William Camp Gildersleeve married Mary Gardiner of Philadelphia. His son died in 1836, at just 17. By 1837, Gildersleeve had established himself as an opponent to slavery. He managed a stop on the Underground Railroad from his home in Wilkes-Barre, and would then shuttle escaped slaves north to their next stop in either Scranton, Abington, or Montrose. His efforts were aided by Lucy Washburn and Jacob Welcome, two fugitive slaves that he employed. During this year, he invited a prominent abolitionist to come and give a speech against slavery. The speaker had previously been turned away by churches and politicians. As a result, an angry mob vandalized his home in retaliation. Two years later he invited another abolitionist to speak, this time a mob paraded him through the streets after either soaking him with black dye or having tarred and feathered him. He survived the incident, although none of the perpetrators were arrested. William Camp Gildersleeve died in 1871.Scranton Wochenblatt 12 Oct. 1871. Chronicling America. Web. Fugitive Slave Case On 3 September 1853, U.S. Federal Marshal George Wynkoop and his two deputies, John Jenkins and James Crossen came across a fugitive slave named William Thomas. Thomas was working at the Phoenix Hotel in Wilkes-Barre under the name of Bill. The federal officers recognized him and moved to capture Thomas, who attempted to defend himself with a fork and a carving knife. A brawl ensured, and Thomas managed to escape into the Susquehanna River, shouting that he would rather die than be taken back to slavery. The officers threatened to shoot him, but local residents interrupted them. The officers were chased off, and Thomas escaped. He was eventually found in a cornfield by a group of women, who tended his wounds. The federal officers were prosecuted for \\"inciting a riot\\" in the US Supreme Court Case Maxwell v. Righter. William Camp Gildersleeve testified during the trial, where he targeted the Fugitive Slave Act itself and the actions of Judge Grier, who had ruled in favor of the marshals. Legacy Gildersleeve's testimony in Maxwell v. Righter earned him national recognition as an abolitionist. The testimony was especially praised in African American newspapers. In 2004, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission erected a marker on East Ross Street in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. It reads as follows: Historical marker for William Camp Gildersleeve in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania \\"Prominent merchant and ardent abolitionist significant to the Underground Railroad in Wilkes-Barre. He provided refuge to fugitive slaves at his home and business near here. In 1853, Gildersleeve testified in a U.S. Supreme Court case, Maxwell vs. Righter, in which a fugitive, William Thomas, was shot and wounded by deputy U.S. marshals.

He is a member of the Republican Party. Hollingsworth serves as the Vice Ranking Member of the House Financial Services Committee Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets and a member of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion. Before serving in the House of Representatives, Hollingsworth was a small-business owner. After college, he began renovating and rehabilitating abandoned industrial sites. In 2008, Hollingsworth partnered with businessmen and chemists to start an aluminum remanufacturing operation in Indiana. As of 2017, that facility has produced over 1.8 billion pounds of aluminum. With a net worth of $50.1 million, Hollingsworth is the 12th wealthiest member of Congress. Early life and education Hollingsworth was born in Clinton, Tennessee. He attended the Webb School in Knoxville, Tennessee, and the University of Pennsylvania, graduating from the Wharton School. After graduating from Wharton, Hollingsworth founded Hollingsworth Capital Partners with his father, Joe Hollingsworth Jr. The company specialized in rebuilding old manufacturing sites and returning them to service. He also founded an aluminum remanufacturing company.

Running in the Republican Party primary election against Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller and State Senators Erin Houchin and Brent Waltz, Hollingsworth won with 34% of the vote. He defeated Democratic nominee Shelli Yoder in the November general election with 54% of the vote.

In 2019, Watson moved to Washington, D.C. to lead the Congressional Progressive Caucus Center. =Tenure= Hollingsworth was sworn into his first term on January 3, 2017, and his second term on January 3, 2019. Hollingsworth has promised to serve no more than eight years (four terms) in the House. Government reform, including creating Congressional term limits, has been a priority for him in Congress. In both the 115th and 116th Congress, Hollingsworth introduced a resolution to amend the Constitution to impose term limits on Congressional lawmakers. The measure would limit Congressional terms to four terms in the House of Representatives and two terms in the Senate. The second focus of Hollingsworth's government reform proposal is a lobbying ban for members of Congress. He has introduced the Banning Lobbying and Safeguarding Trust Act, which would ban members of Congress from ever registering as a lobbyist. The third component of Hollingsworth's government reform efforts is spending reform. He believes short-term budgeting wastes taxpayer dollars and therefore has consistently voted against short-term spending bills. = Legislature = In December 2017, Hollingsworth voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. =Committee assignments= *Committee on Financial Services **Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets **Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion Political positions  = Domestic issues = COVID-19 pandemic In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Hollingsworth said he favored ending stay-at- home orders so as to reopen the economy, even though that would mean that more Americans would die. \\"The social scientists are telling us about the economic disaster that is going on,\\" he said. \\"Our GDP is supposed to be down 20% alone this quarter. It is policymakers' decision to put on our big boy and big girl pants and say [more deaths] is the lesser of these two evils. It is not zero evil, but it is the lesser of these two evils and we intend to move forward that direction. That is our responsibility and to abdicate that is to insult the Americans that voted us into office.\\" A statement provided by his office later that day said, \\"It's hyperbolic to say that the only choices before us are the two corner solutions: no economy or widespread casualties. We can use the best of biology and economics to enable as much of the economy to operate as possible while we work to minimize disease transmission.\\"  Health care  Hollingsworth supports the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). He considers the act government overreach and prefers a private insurance system. = International issues =  Trade  Hollingsworth requested that the U.S. Department of Commerce lift its Section 232 restrictions on POSCO Steel, a Korean steel company with a facility in Jeffersonville, Indiana. The Department of Commerce approved the request.  Immigration and refugees  On June 27, 2019, Hollingsworth voted to send $4.6 billion in aid funding to the southern border.  Yemen  Hollingsworth voted for three resolutions in the House of Representatives disapproving of President Trump‚Äôs arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. = Social issues = Abortion Hollingsworth is anti-abortion, and supports defunding Planned Parenthood. In 2017, he posted on social media a statistic showing that Bloomington, Indiana had seen an increase in abortions in 2016. The Indiana State Department reported that Indiana saw a decline in abortions compared to the prior year. He supports requiring health care providers to notify parents if their underage child seeks an abortion. The American Conservative Union has given him a lifetime congressional rating of 88%.

Bannan is best known for his work as editor of the Miners‚Äô Journal. The Miners‚Äô Journal reflected Bannan‚Äôs belief in the Whig and then Republican ideology with which he closely identified. Bannan‚Äôs connection to the anthracite Coal Region of Pennsylvania affected his political affiliation and career, as he advocated tariff protection for US industry and internal improvements. Early life Benjamin Bannan was born into a farming family. When Bannan was eight years old, his father died, leaving his family to tend to the farm. Bannan only attended school for two years. Bannan was inspired to become a printer and editor after reading the Village Record, which his teacher subscribed to. At the age of 15, he learned the printing business at the Berks and Schuylkill Journal. With time, Bannan was asked to become a partner and associate in the business. Eventually, he traveled to Pottsville in April 1829 where he purchased the Miners‚Äô Journal, which he owned for over forty years. Political career Though not a politician himself, Benjamin Bannan became a spokesman for the Whig party in Schuylkill County. After the collapse of the party, he continued to go against the Democrats and thus identified as Republican. To align with his political affiliation, Bannan ran the Miners‚Äô Journal as a ‚Äúleading Whig, nativist, and Republican newspaper‚Äù. Bannan was also heavily influenced by the writings of economist Henry C. Carey. Bannan was an advocate of what historian Eric Foner has dubbed the ‚Äúfree labor ideology\\" of the nineteenth century. The ideology was built upon the belief that social mobility was an inherent aspect of economic expansion. Labor, then, ‚Äúembraced all producers of wealth‚Äù, an economy centered on independent farms and small shops, rather than factories. In this ideology, capitalism and labor worked in harmony and were not opposing factors. The Miners‚Äô Journal was a play on the ‚Äúfree labor‚Äù ideology: the journal was for the small operating class, not the mine workers. To Bannan, the ideal society had an independent middle class made up small entrepreneurial businesses. In the anthracite region he lived in, he saw this as coal operators. Bannan saw the possibility for upward mobility by starting as a laborer, moving to a miner and finally taking the next step to a property holder. Bannan and Irish immigrants Bannan held a strong aversion to Irish Catholic immigrants who generally held the laborer jobs, tended to support the Democratic Party, and consumed alcohol, which offended the teetotaler. In 1857, Bannan mentioned the Molly Maguires in an issue of the Miners‚Äô Journal, in which Bannan linked the group to violence in the area. It is among the first known public references to the secretive group in the US. Bannan made the argument that if more immigrants came, society would be threatened. Though Bannan made the claim, there were no proven accounts of violence from the Molly Maguire until 1862 Bannan in the Civil War Bannan also played a peculiar role during the Civil War anti-draft riots of 1862. He had been named as commissioner of the draft for Schuylkill County. A large portion of Irish Catholic miners (especially in Cass Township) had been named for fulfilling the quota of the draft by Bannan. This led to an altercation in which most of these miners not only refused to respond to the call of the State to go to Harrisburg by train on the designated date, but to riot by excluding the willing conscripts from the train. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton directed troops dispatched to Schuylkill County to enforce the draft. However, Pennsylvania Congressman Alexander McClure, contacted President Lincoln, who was only interested in seeing the law executed, or ‚Äúat least to appear to have been executed‚Äù, to which the President, according to General Townshend who was commanding the troops sent to Schuylkill County, added: ‚ÄúI think McClure will understand.‚Äù Bannan consulted with McClure and told him that the draft could not be executed in Cass Township without a bloody conflict with the Irish Catholic miners who he told McClure were under the influence of Molly Maguires. Bannan told McClure there was no method by which there could be given the appearance of executing the law. McClure told him that in several districts in the Commonwealth had shown that their quota had been entirely filled by volunteers, some of whom had enlisted in county towns or in the cities and had not been properly credited to the district as the law required. They agreed that only in that way could the Cass Township problem be solved if it were practicable. Bannan then returned with a large number of affidavits ‚Äúproving‚Äù that the quota of Cass Township had been filled by volunteers, chiefly by men connected with the mines who had enlisted from the towns or cities where companies or regiments were being formed.McClure, Alexander K., Old Time Notes of Pennsylvania: A Connected and Chronological Record of the Commercial, Industrial and Educational Advancement of Pennsylvania, and the Inner History of All Political Movements Since the Adoption of the Constitution of 1838, Volume 1, Winston 1905, pp546-48 Other contributions Bannan was an early advocate of a national currency. Additionally, Bannan campaigned for tariff protection for US manufacturers. Coal, Iron, and Oil In addition to Bannan‚Äôs newspaper publication of the Miners‚Äô Journal and contributions to government policies, Bannan co-authored Coal, Iron, and Oil with Samuel Harries Daddow. The book deals with mineral resources and the manufacturing industry. Coal, Iron, and Oil is said to have been one of the most expensive single volume book published at the time.

History  The Tin Palace nightclub opened in the fall of 1973 at Bowery and Second Street in New York's East Village. Its founder, Paul Pines, lived in the neighborhood and had managed and tended bar at the off- Broadway theater watering hole Phebe's, on East 4th Street. He wanted to open a jazz club that captured the high energy of old downtown jazz clubs but not the hard drugs and doomed history set by Charlie Parker and Lee Morgan. Pines stated, ‚ÄúI knew I wanted a jazz room with the energy of Sluggs', but not the pathology‚Äîthe doomed gestalt of hard drugs and raw emotion that had so deeply attached itself to the music since Charlie Parker, the poet maudit of jazz. I believed it was possible to turn that around, that a music which reached for transcendence as often as for a soul could find a more conducive setting. The first six months catered to the Bowery/Soho crowd, which included painters in the lofts, such as Mike Goldberg and Robert Indiana.\\" Eddie Jefferson, jazz vocalist, lyricist and innovator of vocalese. The club opened with Murray Shapinski Quartet, Charlie Turyn, saxophonist, Vinnie Giangreco, guitarist. Stanley Crouch (not then the traditionalist he became) had proposed opening an avant-garde Sunday afternoon series, which was very successful \\"turning Sunday afternoons into prime time for jazz listening.\\" He brought in Air - the trio of Henry Threadgill, Fred Hopkins and Steve McCall; David Murray, James Blood Ulmer, Oliver Lake and many others. Poet Patricia Spears Jones recalls 1976, \\"So The Tin Palace was where the downtown jazz heads and their girlfriends and occasional actual wives could be found afternoons or evenings listening to music and sipping medium quality Chardonnay. When the World Saxophone Quartet composed of David Murray, Julius Hemphill, Hamiet Bluiett and Oliver Lake played The Tin Palace, I took money at the door. And depending on who was playing and or was it town, the mix could include Anthony Braxton, or European instrumentalists and Japanese tourists. That first event, there was a modest crowd that evening. And they got the thrill of a debut‚Äîfour master reed players making sounds that went on to cover the globe.\\" Owner Pines presented jazz from the classics and standards to cutting edge avant-garde and Afro- Brazilian artists. The club became recognized by the media and music industry as a seminal avant garde jazz and poetry venue and soon the seedy East Village backstreet was lined by limousines and Japanese tourists and hosted popular figures like Kurt Vonnegut and Martin Scorsese. Considered \\"an unlikely mecca,\\" \\"an important jazz spot\\" that \\"kind of legitimatized the area,\\" the Tin Palace \\"a haven for loft musicians\\" was a venue that \\"...paved the way for today's much larger and (for some, at least) more prosperous live music scene. New York City owes them a debt that can never be repaid.\\" Pines booked the musicians until he sold it in 1976, and the club continued for another three years, with Crouch booking the room. Although several artists appeared at the Tin Palace, Paul Pine notes Eddie Jefferson, Richie Cole, Jimmy Giuffre, Paul Bley and Steve Swallow as memorable for him. He also fondly recalls the establishment of the World Saxophone Quartet which started at the Tin Palace. Pines went on to use the Tin Palace as inspiration for his writing, and found and program the Jazz at the Lake: Lake George Jazz Weekend in upstate New York.

Spain‚Äôs ICAA Film and Audiovisual Arts Institute and the Catalan Institute of Cultural Enterprises (ICEC) put up co- funding. Ver√≥nica Echegui was not the first choice for the role of Sara. The role of Sara was originally played by Clara Lago but then she declined in favor to starring in the film '√ìrbita 9' The film was shot during seven weekends in Guadalajara, Madrid, and Hong Kong.  Soundtrack  The music created for the film is divided into two parts ‚Äì Aaron‚Äôs songs and the film score itself. The score itself is a mixture of kooky vintage, indie pop and funky nonsense that complements the very strong visual style of the film. The soundtrack and original songs were composed by Simon Smith. The lead male character, Aaron, is a pop star and there are many musical scenes that needed original songs to establish the character's career and reveal his feelings. Victor Hernandez also provided help with lyrics and song development before shooting. Alex Garcia, who plays Aaron, had never sung before and took intensive voice and guitar lessons and worked closely with Simon and Maria to develop the character. The soundtrack has a fresh pop style, drawing on funk, jazz, pop, dub, dance music and electronic music. Simon also wrote several other songs for the score in English that reappear throughout the film, sung by Catalan singer Maria Rod√©s, to represent the inner mind of the female lead character, Sara.

The primary star is an RV Tauri variable, a cool luminous post-AGB star evolving into a white dwarf. History U Mon was reported to be variable in 1918 by the renown German astronomer Ernst Hartwig. It was then included by Shapley in his list of Cepheid variables. In the 1950s a series of papers established the fundamental observational parameters of the star, its period, brightness range, colour changes, and spectral variation. In 1970, U Mon was discovered to have a large infrared excess. The double-peaked spectral energy distribution and polarization are strongly indicative of a dust shell around the star. Visibility U Mon can often be seen with the naked eye between Sirius and Procyon, but drops below naked eye visibility at deep minima. It lies about two degrees west of Œ± Mon, at fourth magnitude the brightest star in Monoceros. At its brightest U Mon can reach magnitude 5.45. At a shallow minimum it drops to about magnitude 6.0, but at its deepest minima it is below magnitude 7.5. The period is given as 92.23 days, although this varies slightly from cycle to cycle. The brightness of the main pulsations varies over a long secondary period. This takes about 2,500 days, more than twice the length of the secondary period in any other RV Tauri variable. System U Mon is a binary system with a dusty ring surrounding both stars. The companion cannot be observed directly or in the spectrum. Its existence is inferred by radial velocity changes as it orbits every 2,597 days. This is approximately the same time as the long secondary period that modulates the brightness variations. One model for these longterm variations is a periodic eclipse by a circumbinary dust disc. Properties The exact properties of U Mon are uncertain. It has a measured parallax, but with considerable uncertainty. The properties can be inferred by other methods such as spectral line profiles and atmospheric modelling, but these methods are also uncertain for unusual stars like U Mon. RV Tauri stars have been shown to follow a period-luminosity relationship, and this can be used to confirm the luminosity and distance. RV Tauri stars have low masses, although U Mon has been calculated to have one of the highest known masses for the class at about . Despite the low masses, they are highly extended cool stars of high luminosity. U Mon has a luminosity of , although this is both variable and highly uncertain. The spectral luminosity class is of bright supergiant, indicating the rarefied nature of its atmosphere and low surface gravity. The surface gravity varies during the pulsations, dropping to extremely low values as the star passes through its largest size. The temperature varies by about 1,000 K, being hottest when the star is rising towards a maximum. Integrated radial velocities indicate that during the largest pulsations, the location of the reversing layer in the atmosphere moves by nearly 90% of the average stellar radius. U Mon is a metal-poor star, as expected for a low-mass post- AGB object. It shows some enhancement of Carbon, but only to about 80% of the oxygen abundance. There is no suggestion of s-process elements being over- abundant. This is consistent with first dredge-up abundances, suggesting that most RV Tauri stars were not massive enough to experience a third dredge-up. U Mon is surrounded by a dusty circumstellar disc, a common feature of RV Tauri variables. It is likely to be created by interaction with a binary companion. Evolution U Mon is likely a post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star, an originally sun-like star which is in the end stages of its life just prior to the expulsion of a planetary nebula and contraction to a white dwarf. RV Tau gives an insight into the lives and deaths of stars like the Sun. Evolution models show it takes about 10 billion years for a 1 solar mass () star to reach the Asymptotic Giant Branch.

The company released some rubble films but gradually switched to concentrate on comedies and musicals. In 1948 an estate in Wandsbek was acquired and developed into a modern film studio, with space sometimes rented out to other companies. The company became a stable and economically successful producer in the 1950s.Davidson & Hake p.196 In the 1960s the studio was increasingly used for television production, and Real-Film went out of business by 1965.

They lived in nearby Vaals, the Netherlands. > Our home in Vaals was similar to my father‚Äôs home in Buda. It had a huge > high-ceilinged salon, a library, and numerous guest rooms. It was big, > comfortable and altogether amiable. We eventually hired a Hungarian cook who > became our most prized possession. My mother and my sister easily took over > the organization of my social life, leaving me free for intellectual > pursuits. ‚Ä¶ On weekends we threw open our home to students, assistants and > visitors. My mother and my sister had made it a rule always to be prepared > for unexpected guests, with coffee, cake, and slivovitz. In a short time, > our home became a gem√ºtlich meeting ground for a thousand ideas expressed, I > must admit, at a high noise level in French, Italian, Hungarian, Dutch, > English, and of course German. ... These sorties in internationalism were so > successful that my sister suggested one day that we ought to do something to > maintain regular contact with scientists in other countries ... because of > the influence of our father who taught us to have a world view. With the help of Tullio Levi-Civita of the University of Rome they organized for 1922 the \\"world‚Äôs first international conference in mechanics\\" in Innsbruck, Austria. Theodore recalled, \\"My sister and I paid the secretarial expenses out of our own pockets.\\" :My sister, I must mention, was ideally equipped for international conferences. For one thing, she was blessed with a remarkable linguistic talent and not only spoke Hungarian, German, French, English, and Spanish fluently, but she had great facility in picking up new and strange tongues as well. I recall that on a Mediterranean cruise some years ago she found herself at home with Turkish ship‚Äôs personnel and was soon talking Turkish although she had never heard the language before. When Theodore was recruited to direct the aerodynamics laboratory at Caltech, the whole family moved: :Our home life in Pasadena was a continuation of life in Aachen. My mother and sister had found a sprawling Spanish-style home on Marengo Avenue, with a huge dining room and living room and two wings where we could live independently of one another but find a common meeting place around a large oak dining-room table. In a few months we threw open our doors to students and other visitors and thereby continued in Pasadena the international gem√ºtlichkeit we had enjoyed so much in Aachen. ... My sister Pip√∂ was fond of the movie colony and our guests included writers, producers and actors ‚Ä¶ Among other guests generally collected by my sister were spiritualists, magicians and other odd characters whom we found in great abundance in Southern California. When Enrico Fermi was visiting Pasadena, he asked Theodore whether it would be possible to visit a movie studio. \\"Since my friends and those of my sister included a number of Hollywood personalities, notably the Hungarian actors Paul Lukas and Bela Lugosi, I had no difficulty arranging a luncheon for Fermi at the studios.\\" In 1951 Theodore and Pip√∂ travelled to the dedication of the Arnold Engineering Center at Tullahoma, Tennessee. After the dedication, on way to New York, she had a heart attack. She died in Pasadena on July 2, 1951. It was then that Theodore realized who he had lost: :Little Pip√∂ was not only my last family link to the past. She was also the organizer of the day-to-day details of my life, the sharer of my innermost feelings. She knew with an uncanny instinct when to keep me free from interruption when I was immersed in scientific work, and when to open the gate to entertainment and gaiety. I never realized until she was gone how close we were to each other and how much I depended on her. Theodore was a founding partner of Aerojet corporation which grew rapidly. Unable to fund the growing operations, the founders were pressured to sell their stock in the company: :I continued to hold out for a number of months, but after some negotiation General Tire finally made a concession I could not resist. The firm promised to contribute over $50,000 to a foundation for worthy art students set up in the name of my sister Pip√∂, if I would sell my Aerojet holdings ... touched by the pleasing corporate nod to the memory of my dear sister, I relinquished my remaining shares in 1953.

Unlike with a distributed database, there is no central administrator. A peer-to-peer network is required as well as consensus algorithms to ensure replication across nodes is undertaken. One form of distributed ledger design is the blockchain system, which can be either public or private. Characteristics The distributed ledger database is spread across several nodes (devices) on a peer-to-peer network, where each replicates and saves an identical copy of the ledger and updates itself independently. The primary advantage is the lack of central authority. When a ledger update happens, each node constructs the new transaction, and then the nodes vote by consensus algorithm on which copy is correct. Once a consensus has been determined, all the other nodes update themselves with the new, correct copy of the ledger. Security is accomplished through cryptographic keys and signatures. Applications In 2016, some banks tested distributed ledgers for payments to see if investing in distributed ledgers is supported by their usefulness.  Types  Distributed ledgers may be permissioned or permissionless. This determines if anyone or only approved people can run a node to validate transactions. They also vary between the consensus algorithm ‚Äì proof of work, proof of stake, or voting systems. They may be mineable (one can claim ownership of new coins contributing with a node) or not (the creator of the cryptocurrency owns all at the beginning). All blockchain is considered to be a form of DLT. There are also non-blockchain distributed ledger tables. Non-blockchain DLTs can be in the form of a distributed cryptocurrency or they may be the architecture on which private or public data is stored or shared. The main difference is that while blockchain requires global consensus across all nodes a DLT can achieve consensus without having to validate across the entire blockchain.

It was released on May 5, 2015 by the Universe imprint of the art bookseller Rizzoli. The book features Kardashian's personal selfies, collecting various images previously posted on Kardashian's social media accounts. The photobook received positive reviews from critics.  Background  Kim Kardashian has grown an influential online and social media presence, and has always been known for taking selfies, and was called \\"queen of selfies\\" by The New York Times. In an interview with Adweek, Kardashian mentioned that she has been taking pictures of herself for decades, and said: The photobook was announced in August 2014; the idea to assemble a book from selfies first came to Kardashian when she was thinking of what to give to her husband Kanye West as a Valentine's Day gift. \\"I couldn't think of what to get Kanye [for Valentine's Day] and so I was like, 'All guys love it when a girl sends them sexy pics.' So I had Stephanie [Kim's assistant] get a Polaroid, and we were taking photos around the entire house‚Ä¶making this cool book,\\" Kardashian commented on an idea during an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. \\"It ended up turning out so cool we came up with this idea to do a selfie book. So I'm going to make some super racy,\\" she continued.  Concept  The book features various selfies of Kardashian, including travel pictures, family photos, and swimsuit shots. The book also features various nude photographs, also including pictures that were leaked during the celebrity photo hack in September 2014. Kardashian explained the reasoning of including the pictures: \\"I wasn't intending to put these in the book but saw them online during the iCloud hack. I'm not mad at them. [...] They are taken with a Blackberry and I don't have iCloud... It's all a mystery!\\". The table book has picture with her husband Kanye West and daughter North West. The book also includes selfies with her celebrity friends, such as Ciara, La La Anthony, Jennifer Lopez, Jonathan Cheban, among others, as well as her family members: Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner and her brother Rob Kardashian.  Release  The photobook was released on May 5, 2015. Prior to the official date, Kardashian released a limited-edition version of the book on April 16, 2015. It featured an alternative cover with a selfie of Kardashian wearing a red bikini. The version became available on Gilt.com with a limited availability of 500 copies of numbered and signed version of the book, which reportedly were sold out in a minute. The new and updated volume of Selfish was scheduled to be released on October 11, 2016. The revised and expanded edition would contain 64 additional pages featuring Kardashian's selfies, including many never-seen-before images.  Reception  The photobook received positive reviews from critics. Kat Brown of The Telegraph described the book as \\"unexpectedly revealing\\" and \\"oddly moving\\", also adding that \\"by the time you get to her photobombing another friend mid- selfie [...] or making faces with her family [...], you think that she'd actually be quite a laugh to go out with\\". Madeline Roth of MTV News noted the book's significance by saying that it is \\"the first of its kind on the book market today: a literal book of selfies by one of the most famous human beings in the world.\\" Megan Garber of The Atlantic said the book \\"takes [Kardashian's] (in)famous love of her own image to a logical, and also absurdist, extreme,\\" comparing the book to the \\"Kramer's coffee table book about coffee tables\\". Gregory Babcock, a writer for the Complex magazine, wrote a very positive review of the book, and said: \\"The pages of Selfish reveals that what may seem insipid and overblown initially is actually a far smarter, more calculated window into the life and times of one of our culture‚Äôs most relevant public figures through the simple, albeit absurd, art of documenting herself.\\" Jillian Mapes of Flavorwire commented that the book \\"occupies a place somewhere between a Marina Abramoviƒá stunt and your Facebook friend who splices together brief video clips every day for year\\". Mapes further said: \\"But because she looks less than perfect in many of these photos, [...] it‚Äôs hard for me to flip through Selfish and feel like it‚Äôs as wildly vain as it appears at first glance. Madonna‚Äôs Sex, Selfish is not, at least with regard to art direction and styling\\". Sarah Begley, writing for Time, appreciated Kardashian giving credit to her make-up artists and stylists in the captions under the pictures. Begley quips, \\"The architecture of the Sistine Chapel may be exemplary, but it‚Äôs Michelangelo‚Äôs paint job that packs in the crowds\\". Laura Bennett wrote a positive review of the book for Slate and described the book as \\"insane project, a document of mind-blowing vanity and deranged perseverance\\". Bennett further accentuated the book's format, and said: \\"You could call Selfish a sneakily feminist document, an act of reclamation by one of the world's most photographed women\\". Leah Bourne of StyleCaster said that \\"Kardashian has ushered in a new kind of fame‚Äîone in which you can be famous for seemingly being nothing more than yourself‚Äîwith this book she might also be ushering in a new form of autobiography\\". Bourne also noted that the book \\"takes a lot of cues\\" from other photobooks such as Sex featuring shots of Madonna by Fabien Baron or Kate Moss' portrait collection composed by Mario Testino. Haley Mlotek from the National Post called the book \\"a welcome reprieve\\" and noted that \\"the images collected in Selfish will be a crucial part of how we know and understand Kardashian West as a person, a public figure, and a global phenomenon\\". Writing for The Guardian, Jonathan Jones wrote that the photobook is \\"the ultimate slap in the face for anyone who ever pointed a camera with high hopes of being the new Henri Cartier-Bresson or Don McCullin\\" and suggested that \\"Kardashian‚Äôs selfie-taking is, in reality, a sustained act of self-exploitation in which she sells herself as commodified, leered-at flesh.\\"  References   External links  * Kim Kardashian West: Selfish on Rizzoliusa.com Category:2015 non-fiction books Category:Kim Kardashian Category:Coffee table books Category:Erotic literature Category:Photographic collections and books ","title":"Selfish (book)"},{"id":"50414432","text":"The Fortune Society is a New York City-based non-profit organization that provides essential support to the formerly incarcerated. Some of the services offered include help with finding housing and jobs, adjusting to civilian life and educational opportunities. It was founded by David Rothenberg in 1967 as a result of his experience at Rikers while researching for the play Fortune and Men's Eyes. Overview John Herbert, the author of Fortune and Men's Eyes, had been incarcerated previously as an altercation had caused a mass roundup by police. The judge sentenced him to prison due to his ambiguous gender presentation. Inspired by the play and Herbert's experience at Rikers, Rothenberg channeled a passion for activism into a non-profit advocacy organization, and called it the Fortune Society in honor of the play. By the time the play premiered in Canada, the Fortune Society had been created. Initially, the organization began as discussion forums at the Actor's Playhouse featuring a diverse set of participants including parole officers, elected officials and the formerly incarcerated among others. Pat McGarry and Clarence Cooper, author of The Farm, agreed on an organization called the Fortune Society, from the play‚Äôs title, which had been taken from a Shakespearian sonnet, ‚ÄúWhen in disgrace with fortune and men‚Äôs eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state.‚Äù Rothenberg‚Äôs office on W 46th became the de facto headquarters of the organization and the group began fundraising at Tuesday night discussions. In an effort to raise awareness, four men from the society went on the David Susskind Show. Clarence Cooper, Frank Sandiford, Eddie Morris, and Rob Freeley were panelists on the show leveraging their social status and celebrity. Susskind informed the audience that the men were all part of a new organization and to connect to them at the Fortune Society at their office address. The next day 250 former convicts were lined up outside Rothenberg's small theater office, anticipating an organization that could help them with employment and housing. Mel Rivers also came that day to see what the organization was all about resulting in Rivers, Jackson, McGarry, and Cooper starting as the core of the Fortune Society. Rothenberg began arranging for the formerly incarcerated to come to the Fortune Society to attend Broadway plays. He recruited his close friend and colleague Alvin Ailey to join the organization, and provide tickets for the those the society was trying to help. Kenny Jackson joked that when you get out of prison in New York, ‚Äúyou get $40, a baloney sandwich, and two tickets to Alvin Ailey.‚Äù Around this time, the Attica Prison riot broke out. Rothenberg was included on the prisoners' shortlist for civilian observers. This prompted Arthur Eve's office to call on him and recruit him for that role. He was among the three dozen men called in to Attica as observers. The group unanimously agreed to send a smaller delegation to represent observers. The delegation included William Kunstler, Tom Wicker of the New York Times, congressman Herman Badillo and state senator John Dunne, who returned to New York to plead with governor Nelson Rockefeller, only to find he had ordered troops to take over the prison. The takeover was violent and there were casualties. After the dust settled, four prisoners' bodies remained unclaimed. The Fortune Society made arrangements for these men to receive proper funerals. The Attica Prison riot raised awareness of conditions prisoners faced during incarceration. These events spurred Rothenberg's many friends and colleagues to work with other theater professionals to host additional fundraising events. Notables including Arlene Francis, Melba Moore, Zoe Caldwell, and Christopher Reeve supported the organization and raised funds. In addition, Attica prison publicized the Fortune Society to its prisoner population. Many volunteers offered to help after Attica, providing tutoring and secretarial services. The model tutoring program that still runs today was created at this time, offering classes for illiteracy, GED and college preparation, as well as career services. The society grew in office space and participants with the welcome collaboration of educational institutions During the infancy of AIDS, the society received letters from inmates with tales of men dying of a strange epidemic. Rothenberg sent literature from the Gay Men's Health Crisis to Deputy Commissioner Marty Horn, who said they could not allow literature with the word gay in it. After discussion with Gay Men‚Äôs Health Crisis, the word was never spelled out and the wardens permitted the brochures to enter. Thus, the Department of Corrections took its first step in recognizing the epidemic‚Äôs effect on the inmate population.

The railroad was created to carry coal most efficiently from the Clover Hill Pits in Winterpock, Virginia, to further transportation points in Chester, Virginia, where it could sold for a better price than on the Appomattox River in the Piedmont region. This made the railroad important to the Confederacy in the Civil War to ensure a supply of coal for munitions and iron working. The mines were dangerous for the miners, and many accidents occurred. The railroad had to be sold when coal mining declined so that new owners could find other uses for the railroad. History =Founding of the Railroad= The Clover Hill Railroad Company was chartered in 1841 by the Virginia General Assembly to do business with the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad but was not allowed to charge more than 2 cents per bushel of coal shipped over the railroad. In 1845 the Clover Hill Railroad replaced the mules that brought coal from the Clover Hill Pitts to the Appomattox at Eppington to be shipped on the Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System to Petersburg. In 1847, October 1, the Clover Mining Company built of railroad from the coal mines at Winterpock to the town of Chester to make a spur of the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad. By 1848 the railroad spur had hauled 56 tons of coal for export and 22 tons for use in Richmond and Petersburg. The Clover Hill struggled with increases charged on prices for transporting coal to Richmond, Petersburg and Port Walthall by the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad in 1854. The Clover Hill also found it necessary to ask the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad to fulfill their agreements and maintain the Clover Hill Railroad tracks. In 1866 the Clover Hill Mining Company built a wharf at Osborne's Landing in order to load the coal on to ships to the coast. The line was extended to Osborne's Landing in 1867. =American Civil War and the Clover Hill Railroad= During the Civil War, the Confederate States needed coal because they could not get it from Pennsylvania. They turned to mines in Midlothian and Clover Hill, Virginia. DS Woolridge, a Confederate government coal agent in Richmond, wrote in 1862 that he had received, by way of the Clover Hill Railroad, over 1320 bushels of coal for delivery to Manassas, Virginia. The Clover Hill Coal Mines were one of the main suppliers of coal to the Tredegar Iron Works for Confederate arms. Coke, a very pure coal-based fuel, was also made at Winterpock from 1865 to 1870 for use in Tredegar. Clover Hill, in turn, bought bars and spikes from the Tredegar Iron Works. The U.S. Federal Government ran the Clover Hill Railroad in the last year of the Civil War to meet coal shortages in Richmond and Petersburg. =Bankruptcy= The demand for coal from the mine declined after the Civil War. The railroad lost money, and in 1877 the Railroad and Mines were sold to the Brighthope Mining Company. In 1881, the line was reconstituted by investors as the Brighthope Railway.

Eventually, Rothenberg became editor in chief in the student academic years '54 and '55, even though a petition was circulated alleging he was a communist, likely as a result of his participation in social and political protests.Rothenberg, pages 89‚Äì91,44 While at the paper, he exposed the rape of fraternity boys at the university by Francis Van Derbur, the father of former Miss Colorado and Miss America, Marilyn Van Derbur who exposed her father's sexual abuse decades later. This story was suppressed by Francis Van Derbur due to his high standing in the business community and his position on the Alumni Association at the universityRothenberg, pages 92‚Äì95 Broadway career Rothenberg arrived in NYC in 1958 after release from the US Army.Rothenberg, page 16 He was inspired to pursue acting after seeing Joseph Mankiewicz's dialogue in the movie All About Eve. Initially, he worked with ad agencies and book publishers as a typist to make ends meet while simultaneously sending out introduction letters to theatrical producers, agents, and press agents listed in the Manhattan directory. He also answered ads listed in the New York Times related to show business. Rothenberg was eventually hired by Bob Larken to cover interviews with actors, directors and producers by TV and radio stations.Rothenberg, pages 17‚Äì20 Through his press coverage of the hit musical Jamaica he met Alvin Ailey. Their acquaintance grew into a friendship and through it Rothenberg was invited to various rehearsals that helped him grow his professional network. As a result, he attained a theatrical apprenticeship with the help of Bob Ullman, who sponsored him for it with ATPAM and arranged a summer job for him as a press rep. Rothenberg spent the summer of 1960 at Lakewood Theatre in Skowhega, Maine. The theatre saw the likes of Joan Fontaine, Shirley Booth and Henry Morgan perform there and gave Rothenberg great access and networking opportunities.Rothenberg, pages 19‚Äì22 In 1962, David Rothenberg joined Alex Cohen's office, continuing as a press rep. This position allowed him access to the pantheon of American theatre. Through his work he met and befriended titans of American theatre such as Sir John Gielgud, Richard Burton, Alfred Drake, Charles Boyer, Sir Ralph Richardson, and Elizabeth Taylor.Rothenberg, 30‚Äì32 Rothenberg was Taylor's date to the opening of Hamlet on Broadway, for which he did press.Rothenberg, page 40 His first Broadway production was Beyond The Fringe, which emerged to be one of the biggest hits of the decade.Rothenberg, page 33 It ran for years and many of the cast went on to have distinguished careers. Notably, the production opened at the Golden Theatre on the first day of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Following his success, Rothenberg began representing plays by Pulitzer Prize winning playwrights Edward Albee, Tennessee Williams and England's Harold Pinter, as well as more than 200 Broadway shows over the course of his career. In 1966 Rothenberg was invited by Jordan Charney and Nancy Cooperstein to workshop Megan Terry's Viet Rock, which gave him the opportunity to participate in escalating antiwar protests. Viet Rock was staged at the Sheridan Square Playhouse. By the time Viet Rock opened in New York, Rothenberg had already begun working with Fortune and Men's Eyes, his second standalone production.Rothenberg, pages 47‚Äì50 His friend and drama critic at the Toronto Star, Nathan Cohen, informed Rothenberg of the play, which needed New York before it could make it in Toronto. After his first reading, he drafted a letter to the playwright, stating, \\"I felt that I was locked in a room of four cobras.\\"Rothenberg, pages 50‚Äì51 Rothenberg took out a loan to finance the play and it opened in February 1967 at the Actor's Playhouse in Greenwich Village. Four of the young actors in the play were Terry Kiser, Vic Arnold, Bob Christian, and Bill Moore. Holy Face starred as well.Rothenberg, page 52 As part of his research for the play, Rothenberg visited Rikers Island prison in New York, which was his first trip to such an institution. When inmates were in the dayroom, each of the visitors was placed in a cell and locked for a few minutes.Rothenberg, page 53 Critical reception was initially mixed with the New York Times critic Dan Sullivan being dismissive and unmoved by it. Dance critic Clive Barnes thought it exciting and three years later raved about the play's revival after becoming a theatre reviewer for the New York Times.Rothenberg, page 55 Norman Nadel of New York World joined the Telegram and the Sun reviewers in criticizing the play. In contrast, Jerry Tallnem from the New York Post compared it to The Bicycle Thief and Marat/Sade. Michael Smith from the Village Voice raved about it contributing to its 13-month initial run. Eventually, the play was the most successful drama in Canadian history, even playing internationally in more than 40 countries, including Turkey.Rothenberg, pages 56‚Äì60 Fortune Society and Activism John Herbert, the author of Fortune and Men's Eyes, had been incarcerated previously after an altercation by some thugs had caused a mass roundup by police. The judge sentenced him to prison due to his epicene appearance.Rothenberg, page 58 Being deeply moved by the play, his experience at Rikers, and Herbert's plight, Rothenberg channeled his passion for activism into a non-profit advocacy organization called Fortune Society, borrowing from the play's own name. By the time the play premiered in Canada, the Fortune Society had been created. Initially, the organization began as discussion forums at the Actor's Playhouse featuring a diverse set of interlocutors including parole officers, elected officials, and the formerly incarcerated, among others.Rothenberg, page 62 Pat McGarry and Clarence Cooper, author of The Farm, agreed on an organization called the Fortune Society, from the play's title, which had been taken from a Shakespearian sonnet, \\"When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state\\". Rothenberg's office on West 46th Street became the de facto headquarters of the organization, and the group began fundraising at Tuesday night discussions. In an effort to raise awareness, four men from the society went on The David Susskind Show. Clarence Cooper, Frank Sandiford, Eddie Morris, and Rob Freeley were panelists on the show, leveraging their social status and celebrity. Susskind informed the audience that the men were all part of a new organization, and urged them to connect with them at the Fortune Society at their office address.Rothenberg, page 63 The next day 250 former convicts were lined up outside Rothenberg's small theater office, anticipating an organization that could help them with employment and housing. Mel Rivers also came that day to see what the organization was all about, resulting in Rivers, Jackson, McGarry, and Cooper starting as the core of Fortune Society.Rothenberg, page 64 Rothenberg began arranging for ex-cons coming to the Fortune Society to attend Broadway plays, and conscripted his close friend and colleague Alvin Ailey to join the organization and provide tickets for the formerly incarcerated whom the society was trying to help. Kenny Jackson joked that when somebody gets out of prison in New York, \\"you get $40, a baloney sandwich, and two tickets to Alvin Ailey\\".Rothenberg, pages 65‚Äì66 Around this time, the Attica Prison riot broke out, and Rothenberg was included on the prisoners' shortlist for civilian observers. This prompted Arthur Eve's office to call on him and recruit him for that role. He was among the three dozen men called in to Attica as observers.Rothenberg, pages 2‚Äì3 The group unanimously agreed to send a smaller delegation to represent observers. The delegation included William Kunstler, Tom Wicker of the New York Times, congressman Herman Badillo, and state senator John Dunne, who returned to New York to plead with governor Nelson Rockefeller, only to find he had ordered troops to take over the prison. The takeover was violent, and there were casualties. After the dust settled, four prisoners' bodies remained unclaimed. Fortune Society made arrangements for these men to receive proper funerals.Rothenberg, pages 2‚Äì6 The Attica Prison riot raised a lot of awareness about the conditions prisoners faced during their incarceration. These events spurred Rothenberg's many friends and colleagues to work with other theater professionals to host fundraising events. Notables like Arlene Francis, Melba Moore, Zoe Caldwell, and Christopher Reeve supported the organization and fundraised for its cause. Even Attica prison publicized Fortune Society to its prisoner population.Rothenberg, page 66 Many volunteers offered to help after Attica, providing tutoring and secretarial services. The model tutoring program that still runs today was created at this time, offering classes for illiteracy, GED and college preparation, as well as career services. The society grew in office space and participants with the welcome collaboration of educational institutionsRothenberg, page 68 During the infancy of AIDS, the society received letters from inmates with tales of men dying of a strange epidemic. Rothenberg sent literature from the Gay Men's Health Crisis to Deputy Commissioner Marty Horn, who said they could not allow literature with the word gay in it. After discussion with Gay Men's Health Crisis, the word was never spelled out and the wardens permitted the brochures to enter. Thus, the Department of Corrections took its first step in recognizing the epidemic's effect on the inmate population.Rothenberg, page 71 Political Aspirations David Rothenberg ran for city councilman in 1985 in Manhattan to raise awareness about AIDS, which at the time was seen as a \\"gay epidemic.\\" He ran as an openly gay candidate, which prompted significant media attention. He was profiled in the Sunday Daily News and in New York magazine.Rothenberg, page 201-204 Dave Fleischer was recruited as his campaign manager and under his direction the campaign raised over $250,000, a record for the city council race. Rothenberg was widely endorsed, including by the Daily News, the Village Voice, and the Amsterdam News, among others.Rothenberg, page 204-207 Rothenberg garnered 46% of the vote, collecting the third largest number of votes of any candidate in the city's 38 council race. Unfortunately, his opponent had the second greatest number of votes, thus winning the race.Rothenberg, page 210 References Bibliography * External links * David Rothenberg's Memoir of Broadway Glamour, Social Justice, and Political Passion * 2015 Village Award Winner David Rothenberg * Theater Legend David Rothenberg Does Some of His Best Work Offstage * New York Magazine Profile of David Rothenberg * An Afternoon With David Rothenberg: Interview by LGBTQ Center * Fortune Society Website * New Jersey, * Shelter Island Reporter * a Historical Dictionary of LG Lib. entry * Newark Sun Times * North Jersey Category:University of Denver alumni Category:American theatre managers and producers Category:American civil rights activists ","title":"David Rothenberg (activist)"},{"id":"50414484","text":"Tetraena fontanesii, synonym Zygophyllum fontanesii, is a species of plant of the family Zygophyllaceae.

The episode was written by co-producer Jim Barnes and co-executive producer Ken Woodruff and directed by Larysa Kondracki. It was first broadcast on May 2, 2016. In the episode, Theo Galavan is finally resurrected and begins a killing spree across Gotham City, calling himself \\"Azrael\\" while Gordon and Bruce try to arrest Dr. Hugo Strange for his involvement in the resurrection and his inhuman experiments. The episode received critical acclaim, with Azrael's introduction receiving the most recognition. The episode received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series. Plot Having been resurrected by Hugo Strange (B. D. Wong), Theo Galavan (James Frain) is suffering from almost complete memory loss and reciting the sacred book of the Order of Saint Dumas. Meanwhile, Gordon (Benjamin McKenzie) visits Strange to ask him about Karen Jennings' death and the Pinewood Farms program. Strange states that Thomas Wayne started it to heal every disease and denies his involvement. Gordon then shows Strange a warrant to see Victor Fries' corpse but Strange states they cremated him. Strange realizes Gordon made a false warrant so he would admit his lies. While leaving Arkham Asylum, Gordon runs across Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) in the playroom. Later, Nygma overhears Strange and Peabody (Tonya Pinkins) complaining about Gordon's interference. Nygma suggests that he help them to kill Gordon but Strange refuses. But Nygma's attempt to prove his worth inspires Strange to provide Galavan with a story to give his fractured state of mind a sense of self. Using Saint Dumas scripture while claiming to be Adam Dumas, Strange convinces Galavan that he is the order's ancient warrior Azrael and directs him to kill Gordon. Bruce (David Mazouz) is told by Gordon and Bullock (Donal Logue) that the evidence won't be enough to imprison Strange. Angered by this, Bruce reveals that he knows Gordon is responsible for killing Galavan, pushing his belief that the law is ineffective at bringing him true justice. While talking with Captain Barnes (Michael Chiklis), Gordon and Barnes are attacked by Azrael, who is forced to flee when the police arrive. While walking through an alley, Azrael sees a poster of Galavan's campaign which causes some of his memories to return before shrugging it off. Barnes imprisons Gordon in a cell for aiding Karen Jennings' escape. Suddenly, the lights go off and Azrael shows up. He kills three officers and tries to kill Gordon. However, Gordon and Barnes escape to the balcony where Barnes fights with a pipe against Azrael and manages to break his sword and pull off his mask, realizing his identity. Azrael then stabs Barnes when Gordon appears. Azrael tries to flee but Gordon shoots him multiple times until he falls off the building, landing on a TV van. The news broadcasts that Galavan is alive and is Azrael, which Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) witnesses from Dahl Manor. Likewise, Butch (Drew Powell), Tabitha (Jessica Lucas) and Barbara (Erin Richards) watch the report from their mansion, to their shock. Barnes is transferred to the hospital. Nygma discovers a secret elevator in the hallway of Arkham Asylum, which directs him to Indian Hill labs, to his surprise. Gordon leaves the GCPD while from a distance, Azrael stands atop a bridge watching him. Production =Development= In April 2016, it was announced that the nineteenth episode of the season would be titled \\"Azrael\\", and was to be written by Jim Barnes and Ken Woodruff, with Larysa Kondracki directing. =Casting= Morena Baccarin, Camren Bicondova, Chris Chalk, and Nicholas D'Agosto don't appear in the episode as their respective characters. In April 2016, it was announced that the guest cast for the episode would include B. D. Wong as Professor Hugo Strange, Tonya Pinkins as Ethel Peabody and Stink Fisher as Aaron Helzinger. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 3.59 million viewers with a 1.2/4 share among adults aged 18 to 49, reaching another series low. This was a decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.72 million viewers. With this ratings, Gotham ranked first for FOX, beating Houdini & Doyle, fourth on its timeslot and ninth for the night on the 18-49 demographics, behind Blindspot, The Odd Couple, two episodes of Mike & Molly, NCIS: Los Angeles, a rerun of The Big Bang Theory, Dancing with the Stars and The Voice. It was also the 32nd most watched of the week in the 18-49 demographics and the 59th most watched overall in the week. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 5.77 million viewers, and a 2.1 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reviews= \\"Wrath of the Villains: Azrael\\" received critical acclaim from critics. The episode received a rating of 100% with an average score of 8.3 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.3 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Gothams version of Azrael was fun, even if it was a bit on-the-nose from a 'Gordon's sins coming back to haunt him' standpoint. Also, Ed Nygma's new role as a cunning evildoer is cool to watch. Strange, however, will most likely cause himself to lose this battle long before Gordon ever makes a definitive move.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"One of the longest-running issues with Gotham has been its futile search for an identity. For almost two seasons now the show has struggled to define what it is and, more importantly, what it has to offer each and every week. That last point is especially significant in today's TV climate, where superhero shows are treated with the same amount of reverence afforded so- called prestige dramas; in fact, the age of Peak TV seems to make superhero shows even more popular, as their blend of episodic and serialized storytelling perfectly fit into models of both binge watching and week-to-week appointment viewing. Every show, to an extent, struggles to define what it is and what it has to offer, but superhero shows like The Flash, Arrow, and Marvel's Agent Carter have moved through those struggles and come out on the other side with a mostly cohesive vision. You know what you're getting from them every week in terms of storytelling, visual aesthetic, performances, tone, and themes. The same can't be said for Gotham, which feels like it's constantly changing shapes, forging new directions before abandoning them and starting all over again. There's no easy answer, but 'Azrael' at least suggests that Gotham does have some redeeming qualities mixed into its failed attempts at being a police procedural, superhero show, and lengthy origin story. When Gotham is good it's not taking itself too seriously while using its supporting performances to craft a story that's actually fun to watch unfold. 'Azrael' succeeds in large part because of the performances, as many of them are firing on all cylinders here.\\" Andy Behbakht of TV Overmind gave the series a star rating of 4.5 out of 5, writing \\"Overall, 'Azrael' was a very strong episode that did a solid job with introducing their version of Azrael and with only three episodes left of the season: things are starting to come full circle nicely.\\" Keertana Sastry of EW stated: \\"That's how Hugo Strange and his No. 2, Peabody, describe the newly revived Theo Galavan on Monday night's Gotham, 'Wrath of the Villains: Azrael,' and they could not be more right. As the title of the episode suggests, the Order of St. Dumas comes back in a big, big way to the series, but this time it's not Theo pulling the strings.\\" References  External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 2) episodes Category:2016 American television episodes ","title":"Azrael (Gotham episode)"},{"id":"50414521","text":"Bullan Weijden (1901‚Äì1969) was a Swedish stage and film actress.Qvist & von Bagh p. 181 She was married to the composer Alvar Kraft.

Early cars were more Tootsietoy-like with simple cast bodies, wheels and no interiors. Later, in competition with Corgi and Dinky, Mercury added interior details and opening features to remain competitive. Early cars, like an 'Aero' coupe (which looked kind of like a Lancia Aprilia coupe) and 'race car' were generic and not based on real cars and early sizes hovered around 1:40 scale (History of Mercury 2013; Ralston 2009, 62; Richardson 1999, 134; Batazzi et al 1974, cover). The Aero was first a promotional for an Italian radio manufacturer named SAFAR, but almost immediately produced in its own right (History of Mercury 2013). The company often took photos of cars at the Pininfarina and nearby Fiat factories where Mercury was located in the same industrial zone (Ralston 2009, 62; Batazzi et al 1974). Among the first 'real' cars Mercury made were the 1949 Fiat 500C Topolino and the 1950 Fiat 1400 sedan (Ralston 2009, 62, 64).  Models  Mercury made more than 100 different models in its distinguished history. Italian sedans and sports cars were often the subject of Mercury and most were in 1:43 scale. In fact, Mercury's competition with the fine Politoys M series in the 1960s was simply called Mercury 1:43. Some British, American and German cars were offered, but also similar to Politoys M series, Italian Ferraris, Alfa Romeos, FIATs and Maseratis were common offerings. American cars seen were a Cadillac Eldorado, Lincoln Continental convertible, Studebaker Commander, a two-tone Studebaker Golden Hawk, and, later, a racing Chevrolet-powered Chaparral Prototipo 2F (Ralston 2009, 62-65). The tiny Autobianchi Bianchina was unique, as was the 1957 Alfa Giuletta, or the Porsche 908 Nurburgring. Earlier models did not have interiors. Later models added plastic windows without interiors while even later ones were as detailed and as exact as Politoys or Mebetoys which were Mercury's main competition, at least in the Italian market (Ralston 2009, 65). Often, all doors, hoods, and trunks would open and other moving features ensured the cars would not last long in the hands of younger children. In fact, during 1964 Mercury introduced a Fiat 2300S and a Maserati 2500GT where all features opened. This appears to have been a first in the industry (Ralston 2009, 62-63). Models like the Alfa Romeo Giulia Canguro Bertone had entire doghouses and engine compartments that opened in the appropriate directions. Cars were the mainstay of the company but some commercial vehicles were available like the earlier Autocarro Ciclope, a long Saurer moving van with opening rear doors and a Viberti tanker truck (Ralston 2009, 62-64). These were offered in a variety of colorful liveries like A Welti Furrier AG for the Saurer van and the use of the attractive Agip logo for the tanker (Ralston 2009, 62; Richardson 1999, 135). A Mercury Speedy (Matchbox sized) Fiat 248 van. In Italy Mercury had the diecast toy field to itself until 1960 when Politoys first started with its own plastic vehicles (Richardson 1999, 135). Between 1959 and 1964, Mercury moved toward 1:43 scale for models, leaving behind the larger 1:40 (Ralston 2009, 62; Richardson 1999, 134). Models often had interesting choices of livery and racing detail. For example, the Ferrari 330P Monza open cockpit race car was offered in several colors including a Silverstone green with British flags, but also in yellow and the standard prancing horse red. The Ital Design Manta was another model not often seen in miniature. Sometimes doors and hoods did not match well to bodies, like on the Alfa Carabo Bertone's gull-wing doors, or the body shape of the Mercedes C-111 rotary, but the attempt was honorable and often the features were distinct compared to those seen in Politoys or Mebetoys. The Alfa Romeo Montreal Bertone was cast nicely, but perhaps not as well as the Politoys M version while the Spanish Pilen C-111 was done with better proportions than the Mercury. Besides more exotic Ferraris, Maseratis and Alfas, the more humble fare of Fiat 600s, 1100 sedans, 850 standard and Bertone 128 coupes and sedans, and 124 sedans were offered, Alfettas and Lancia sedans were also produced. Among the most endearing Mercurys were the smaller scooters like the APE with delivery box, Lambretta delivery and solo scooter and the ubiquitous Vespa (Force 1992, 50). Construction and farm vehicles were also offered. Some of the newer models seemed to be attempts (if rather feeble) to compete with the snazzier Hot Wheels. The well-done 1930s Fiat Balilla roadster, for example was later hot-rodded with a V-8 engine, brash exhaust pipes and a roll cage.  The Chaparral 2F  An up close examination of the Chaparral 2F (Mercury \\"articolo\\" # 30), produced about 1970, is a good example of the company's ingenuity. The rear wing (which along with its struts was diecast metal) moved up and down and also tilted. The gull-wing doors were molded in clear plastic with lower portions painted white like the body. Rear mesh covering the engine and lined vents added realism. Sometimes Mercury models went above and beyond the norm. On the Chaparral, this was seen in minutae lilke tiny dual diecast metal gas caps which opened. Decals were fairly precise and historically accurate including sponsorship by Shell and toy model manufacturer Cox - labeled on the sides. The steering wheel was a couple of sizes too big, but other features made up for that. The front headlight were cast not in clear plastic, but in a yellowish tint. The exhaust tips exited the rear molded into a separate metal plate - the tips were also machined to look hollow. Also, Chaparral creator Jim Hall was from Texas and the Mercury version has yellow Texas plates. Having stated many positives, this model, produced about 1970, was not perfect in proportion. The rear quarters look a bit too thick and square and the gentle curve of the doors up to the engine lid vents is lost on this model. Also, those vents on the real car are molded to look like two separate intakes while it is a single intake on each side of the model. The front grill on the Mercury is just an elongated rectangle while the real car's was oval-ish.  Smaller series  In 1949 Mercury introduced a smaller sized series of vehicles called 'MicroMercury' in about 1:80 scale (History of Mercury 2013). This series was fairly short-lived. These were focused on HO railway modeling and sold along with some train and wagon models that today are quite rare (History of Mercury 2013). Later, Mercury's smaller 'Matchbox' sized cars were the Speedy series. These were made to compete more with Mattel's Hot Wheels (and with Matchbox), though the line consisted of mainly Italian or European models. There were about twenty cars in the series. Notable were OSI Silver Fox, Sigma Grand Prix car, and an Alfa Romeo Montreal which is rarely seen by any manufacturer in this smaller size (Mercury Speedy 2014). The Ford GT40 was one of the more popular and easier-to-find in the Speedy series. Earlier Speedy models from the later 1960s had rubber tires which is rare in smaller scale diecast cars. About 1970, the \\"Hot Wheels\\" syndrome caused low friction plastic wheels to be added and the name of the line was altered to \\"Speedy Velox\\" (Mercury Speedy 2014).  Motorcycles  Another series, similar to Politoys offerings, was the 1:24 scale series of motorcycles. One offered was the 1971 Kawasaki 750 Mach IV. Some of Mercury's earlier motorcycle offering were produced secondhand by Dalia, and, later, Guiloy, of Spain (History of Mercury 2013; Richardson 1999, 135).  Marketing and packaging  Most boxes, up to the 1970s anyway, portrayed nicely done artwork (often more expensive for the companies since artists need to be contracted), though some early boxes were plain white with the Mercury logo only (Ralston 2009, 64). Early boxes were commonly blue with simple artwork showing the car only. Later boxes were often red with model details on the red sides and then painted art scenes with the car on alternate panels (Ralston 2009, 62). Some boxes were light blue, some a darker blue. The illustrator for Mercury was Mario Davazza (History of Mercury 2013). Into the 1970s later boxes were red with windows. These no longer had illustrations. Speedy series Lotus Europa. For a time this series was called 'Speedy Velox'. As seen by the odd proportions of the Europa in this picture, this series was not nearly as good as Matchbox or Siku. Several models were introduced as promotional giveaways for other companies like the first 'Aero' coupe for SAFAR or, later, the FIAT 850 intended for the real car's introduction (History of Mercury 2013). Mercury was a Marklin importer in the 1930s and this connection was continued or renewed through the 1970s when both lines could be found in some catalogues (Richardson 1999, 156). While the motorcycles were also later offered by Dalia and Guiloy, some Mercury models were also used by Pilen and Joal (History of Mercury 2013). Mercury was known for many different color combinations for its models whereas a company like Corgi may have had only two at the most. For example, the 1:43 scale Fiat 600 Multipla was issued in at least 13 different two-tone combinations (Spano 2015). A later Mercury Fiat 131 Abarth. Earlier 1:43 scale cars were much more realistic. The company also made several gift sets, like the \\"Squadra Corse Ferrari\\" set with a 250LM and four different colored 330P roadsters. The set came with several replacement wheels for the Ferraris (Ralston 2009, 66).  The end  With increased costs and the competition of Politoys, Mebetoys, and other mass producers of diecast toys in Europe, Mercury had more and more difficulty keeping up (Force 1992, p. 6). Through the 1970s, fewer and fewer cars were produced. The last model was the Fiat Ritmo and the company closed its doors in 1978.  References  * Batazzi, M., Teobaldi, D. and Bossi M. 1974.

Professional career In 1973‚Äì89 Trela-Mazur worked at the WSP Institute of History (Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Pedagogiczna) in Opole, and in 1990‚Äì2004 at the Akademia ≈öwiƒôtokrzyska in Kielce, as well as in Brussels (1998-2003). Since 2004 she has served at the Opole University Institute of Political Science. Trela-Mazur received her degree of Doctor of Humanities in 1979 for the work Education among Polish children in the Soviet Union in the years 1941-1946; awarded First Prize in Doctoral Thesis for the year 1979 by the Ministry of Science, Higher Education and Technology. Trela-Mazur obtained her post-doctoral degree in 1999 at the University of Opole for dissertation titled Sovietization of education in eastern Lesser Poland under Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. The work earned Trela-Mazur an Achievement Award from WSP. In her scientific and archival research into history of Polish education in the eastern part of the Second Polish Republic she travelled to Leningrad in 1981 and to Lviv in 1996. Trela-Mazur wrote over a dozen articles on the fate of the Polish community in Western Europe as well, following the collapse of the Soviet empire in 1989. Powojenne losy Trela-Mazur is the author of a compendium of postwar history of Polish intelligentsia from the eastern territories of Poland (known as Kresy), which were incorporated into the Soviet Union by Joseph Stalin at the end of World War II. The book, Powojenne losy inteligencjii kresowej (Postwar History of the Kresy Intelligentsia), is a result of conference held in November 2005 in Opole, in which 16 notable writers and academics participated. The monograph, composed of articles resulting from their research, is focused on specific regions of Kresy, including Wilno Voivodeship (1926‚Äì1939), Polesie Voivodeship, and Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship (1921‚Äì39). Apparently, the most notable paradox of the flight and expulsion of Poles from the Kresy macroregion was the fact that following border shift, the eastern spirit was revived mainly in the westernmost part of new Poland.

The work was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic, for which Lindberg was then composer-in-residence. It was given its world premiere on November 19, 2010 at Symphony Space, New York City, by the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Alan Gilbert. The piece was written in memoriam for Lindberg's friend and fellow composer G√©rard Grisey. Composition Souvenir has a duration of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in three numbered movements. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a chamber orchestra comprising flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, trumpet, trombone, tuba, two percussionists, harp, piano, and a reduced string section of only five players (violin I & II, viola, cello, and double bass). Reception Reviewing the world premiere, Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times said that Lindberg \\"certainly knows how to conjure up wondrous sounds\\" and wrote: David Fanning of Gramophone said, \\"Despite his antipathy to the designation, he has acknowledged that the three movements are conceived as a type of chamber symphony, and they certainly have the leanness, range of texture and character, concentration and sense of evolution that are worthy of that name.\\" He added, \\"Admittedly, following the train of thought isn't always straightforward, and once again I have concerns about a shortish concluding movement that feels almost perfunctory. However, in this case repeated listening certainly pays off.\\" of the Chicago Classical Review similarly observed, \\"Cast in three movements spanning 25 minutes, Souvenir is a symphony in all but name. Unlike many of his scores, often written for Brobdingnagian forces, Souvenir is crafted on a smaller scale for just 18 musicians, yet the work pulses with intense rhythmic dynamism and varied colors and creates a huge sonic impact.\\" Conversely, Andrew Clements of The Guardian described the piece as \\"rather overblown\\".

Formation  On 8 January 1900 a meeting was held at the Brisbane Town Hall with the purpose of amalgamating various patriotic funds throughout Queensland, under the control and supervision of one general fund, the Queensland Patriotic Fund. The first central committee of the Fund featured numerous prominent Queensland politicians and businessmen, including James Robert Dickson as president; Robert Philp as treasurer and George Jackson as secretary. At this meeting Dickson drafted the following resolution - > \\"...The duties of such committee will be to extend the operation of the fund > so as to embrace all parts of the colony, and to provide for the proper > distribution of the funds amongst the disabled Queensland volunteers and > dependents of such Queensland volunteers as may unfortunately lose their > lives in the execution of their duty, and whose dependents, in the opinion > of the committee, are in need of assistance\\".

The novel focuses on the contradictions within the life of an aging sex worker, the title character Jagua Nana. The novel is set in the city of Lagos. The novel has been compared to works by Charles Dickens, in terms of its moral assessment of the city and city life, and its critique of the social problems faced by people living in those cities. Critics of the work in the 1980s noted that the novel relies heavily on stereotypical depictions of women, hampering its depiction of life in Africa.

The first high-definition broadcasts began in 2001 and since then the number of channels available to view has grown to a maximum of 27 that can be viewed on pay-TV service, Foxtel. Broadcasters =ABC= On 1 January 2002, the ABC began a prime-time simulcast of ABC's Sydney station ABN, except that it had no watermark and was upconverted from standard definition to 1080i high definition. On 1 January 2005 it changed to 576p to accommodate the launch of new channel ABC2 and gradually expanded its operating hours. On 1 January 2008, the ABC's high definition simulcast was rebranded as ABC HD, relaunching as a high definition multichannel with its own logo and branding. The channel was also enhanced to 720p to mark the start of native high-definition content. Throughout its multichannel era, ABC HD continued providing a high definition simulcast of ABN Sydney. As a result, viewers outside of New South Wales would see Sydney- based news bulletins and other localised content. The purpose of this as of 2008, was to provide high-definition versions of ABC1 shows when available (Prior to this, the broadcaster relied on regulation exemptions that allowed it to meet a high-definition quota using content upscaled from standard definition). There were exceptions to the ABC1 simulcast: During the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, ABC HD became a dedicated sports broadcaster, simulcasting the dedicated coverage on ABC2 for most of the day. The 2009 VFL Grand Final was shown exclusively live on ABC HD. For a time up until ABC HD branding ceased, ABC HD screened a \\"7:30 Select\\" national highlights package instead of the Sydney version of Stateline. On 10 June 2010, ABC HD's unique branding was replaced with that of ABC1, reverting the channel to an ABN Sydney simulcast. ABC HD ceased being a simulcast of ABC1 from 6 July 2010 in Tasmania and the ACT; 7 July 2010 in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Northern Territory; and on 8 July 2010 in Victoria and New South Wales, all replaced by a looped pre-launch promotion for ABC News 24 on channel 24. This made ABC the second broadcaster in Australia to permanently discontinue the high definition simulcast of its main channel, following the removal of Ten HD to create Ten's former sports and now entertainment channel One in 2009. ABC Director of Television Richard Finlayson confirmed that the ABC will recommence simulcasting in HD in June 2016. However, in contrast to its past, ABC HD will provide regional-specific simulcasting, not just a nationwide simulcast of ABN Sydney. As a result, ABC News 24 will be reduced to a standard definition broadcast. On 6 December 2016, the ABC HD recommenced simulcasting in high definition, upgrade to 1080i high-definition format via Freeview and Optus D1. As a result, ABC News 24 was reduced to a standard definition broadcast on channel 24. =Seven Network= In 2004, after the 2001 introduction of digital terrestrial television in Australia, the Seven Network began a part-time high definition simulcast on digital channel 70 under the name 7 HD Digital. This simulcast showcased native high definition content alongside standard definition services on Seven. During the times that native high definition content was unavailable for simulcasting, a promo loop that showcased extracts from a variety of Seven's programs was broadcast. 7HD was officially announced on 15 September 2007, with the Seven West Media announcing their intention to start a high definition multichannel, that was initially expected to launch in December 2007. However, 7HD became the first Free-to-air commercial television channel introduced to metropolitan areas since 1988, when it launched prior on 15 October 2007, with 25th Hour being the first program broadcast at 10:30pm. The channel replaced Seven's existing high definition service 7 HD Digital, a part-time simulcast of its standard definition and analogue services. Due to an amendment of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 in 2006, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital television) Act 2006, television networks are now permitted to launch digital multichannels, provided that they are broadcast exclusively in high definition. The channel expanded its broadcast schedule on 10 December 2007 to include daytime programming which had previously been a full simulcast of the main channel. 7HD breakaway programming ceased transmission on Sunday 4 October 2009 in preparation for the launch of 7TWO a few weeks later on 1 November. 7HD then returned to being a full high definition simulcast of Seven, before finally being replaced by 7mate on 25 September 2010. On 10 May 2016, 7HD returned as a high definition simulcast on channel 70. =Nine Network= From the launch of digital TV on 1 January 2001, the Nine Network's high definition service, a simulcast of its standard definition and analogue services, was heavily simulcasting Nine's standard definition content upconverted to HD. From 2002, this was interspersed with a loop of high definition demonstration material during business hours, for viewing in the showrooms of television retailers, at the conclusion of an equivalent service by Network Ten. 2002 saw the first revenue-generating broadcast in native HD in Australia, with the drama Judging Amy. Nine increased its native HD output in the lead-up to the commencement of the HD quota on 1 July 2003, from which point it broadcast a minimum of 1,040 hours of native HD content per year. The largest portion of this was The Today Show. 9HD was officially announced as a part-time (or \\"breakaway\\") multichannel on 27 September 2007, to replace the Nine Network's existing high definition simulcast service through the use of an amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 in 2006. The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital television) Act 2006 permitted television networks to launch digital multichannels, provided that they are broadcast exclusively in high definition. Although originally expected to be the first free-to-air commercial television channel introduced to metropolitan areas since 1988, meant that 9HD was not the first high definition multichannel in Australia. Following this, plans for a November launch in 2007 were postponed until 2008. On 10 March 2008, PBL Media announced that it would launch the channel on 17 March 2008 at 10:30pm, with its first program, Nightline. The re-branded 9HD officially commenced transmission on 17 March 2008 from PBL Media's four metropolitan owned-and-operated stations, TCN Sydney, GTV Melbourne, QTQ Brisbane and NTD Darwin, in addition to WIN Corporation's two metropolitan stations NWS Adelaide, and STW Perth as well as on its regional stations RTQ Queensland, WIN southern New South Wales, VTV Victoria, and TVT Tasmania. The first official program on launch night began at 19:00, Nine News's flagship daily main national nightly television news bulletin program Nine Television News. All 9HD breakaway programming ceased transmission on Sunday 2 August 2009 in preparation for the launch of GO! (now 9Go!) on 9 August. As a result, 9HD became a full simulcast of Nine's main channel. 9HD was replaced by the 9Gem multichannel on 26 September 2010, which unlike the previous incarnation, was a full-time breakaway and branded separately (with one exception being the London Olympics). This removed the HD simulcast of Channel Nine entirely to allow a third channel to fit on Nine's DVB-T multiplex (due to technical and regulatory limitations). As a result, Nine lost all youth, news and comedy content in HD, but instead screened female, crime and lifestyle content on its only HD facility. For the purposes of some sport such as cricket, GEM was still used on an occasional basis to broadcast HD under the Wide World of Sports brand, though not necessarily as a simulcast with Nine. As such, this was generally limited to events outside of prime time, while those with more prominence continued to be shown on the Nine Network. On 26 November 2015, Nine recommenced simulcasting in HD on channel 90. As a result, 9Gem was moved to channel 92 and reduced to standard definition. Then in June 2019, metro viewers were given access to 9 Gem in HD on Channel 95, replacing an advertising channel. This revival marked 9HD's switch to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC broadcasting, allowing the broadcaster to operate at full quality in 1920x1080i50 resolution using a lower bitrate than in 2007. This gives the network the ability to provide all the other multichannel services launched since 2009, such as 9Go!, at the same time. =Network Ten= From the revamp of its production and circle logo and of the slogan Seriously Ten on 1 February 2001, this was interspersed with a loop of high definition demonstration material during business hours, for viewing in the showrooms of television retailers, at the conclusion of an equivalent service by Network Ten. Ten HD was officially announced on 14 September 2007, to replace Network Ten's existing high definition service, a simulcast of its standard definition and analogue services, through the use of an amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 in 2006. The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Act 2006 permitted television networks to launch digital multichannels, provided that they are broadcast exclusively in high definition. Although originally expected to be the first free-to-air commercial television channel introduced to metropolitan areas since 1988, the surprise launch of Seven Media Group's HD offering, 7HD, on 15 October 2007, two months before transmissions were scheduled to begin, meant that Ten HD was launched as the second high-definition multichannel in Australia. PBL Media announced the creation of a similar multichannel, 9HD, on 27 September, which was launched on 17 March 2008. Ten's parent company, and shareholder in metropolitan ratings system OzTAM, Ten Network Holdings Limited, began discussions with the ratings system operator to have digital multichannels, such as Ten HD and ABC2, included in television ratings for the first time on 17 September 2007. As well as this, on the same day, it was announced that the national weekend editions of Ten News would be timeshifted from Ten onto Ten HD, an hour delayed at 6 pm, to directly compete with Seven News and National Nine News. This would have seen Ten News formally broadcast at 6 pm for the first time since 1992, however, the timeslot was later amended to 5.30 pm. In preparation for the launch of Ten HD, Ten's digital terrestrial channel line- up was updated on 19 November 2007, with changes consisting of LCN1 redirecting Network Ten's current high-definition simulcast. Following this, on 21 November 2007, Ten Network Holdings Limited announced that it would launch the channel on 16 December 2007 at 5.00 pm, with the first program, Totally Wild. Ten HD officially commenced transmission on 16 December 2007 from the network's five metropolitan owned-and-operated stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth. Prior to the official launch, at 5.00 pm the first program, Totally Wild, was broadcast. Following this, for the first time since 1992, Ten News and Sports Tonight were broadcast in direct competition with Seven News and National Nine News, timeshifted by thirty minutes to 5.30 pm and 6.00 pm respectively. The first official program on launch night began at 8.30 pm, the 2001 movie Black Hawk Down. This was followed by Bon Jovi's Lost Highway Tour at 11.30 pm and Video Hits Presents: The Music of Supernatural at 12.25 am. Video Hits Up-Late marked the end of the first night of transmission for Ten HD at 12.50 am. In the lead-up to the opening night, the channel promised up to eleven hours of time-shifted programming from Ten in addition to fifty hours of exclusive programming, which included live sport, entertainment, films, documentaries, science fiction and news. This consisted of six movies per week, in addition to National Geographic documentaries in the afternoon, from 3pm to 5pm, music- oriented programming following the Sunday Night Movie, along with a primetime breakaway schedule on Thursdays and from 10.30 pm to 11.30 pm Monday to Wednesday. In addition to high definition broadcasting on channel 1, a standard definition simulcast of Ten HD was provided on channel 11 as Ten SD2. From 2009, commercial networks in Australia were allowed to broadcast a standard definition subchannel. Rather than introduce a new digital service, Ten decided to relaunch Ten HD as a sports-only channel, to be named One HD (now One), and use its standard definition simulcast on channel 11 to broadcast a standard definition simulcast called One SD. Before One HD's official launch, most breakaway programming shown on Ten HD ceased from 1 January 2009, and only showed a high-definition broadcast of the existing Ten digital service, along with a few sports-based breakaway programs. Ten HD officially shut down on 25 March 2009, with One HD launching the following day. After the Nine Network restarted broadcasting 9HD in November 2015, Ten confirmed that it was working on rebroadcasting Ten HD. However, they did not put a time frame on it, stating that they are \\"working through some technical and rights issues\\". On 11 February 2016, some smart TVs began receiving notification messages advising of Ten HD through a \\"ghost broadcast\\" that soon disappeared. Ten later recommenced simulcasting in high definition on 2 March 2016 on channel 13 from 3pm, in time for the 2016 season of the Virgin Australia Supercars Championship. As a result, One was reduced to a standard definition broadcast on both channel 1 and channel 12. Ten uses MPEG-4 technology to broadcast the channel. =SBS= The SBS HD multichannel was launched on 14 December 2006. It broadcasts identical programming to SBS, but in 1080i HD via Freeview and Optus D1. Also in 2018, SBS Viceland was given HD Access on Channel 31. On 1 July 2019, Channel 32 was converted into a HD World Movies in 1080i HD. Platforms =Terrestrial= Freeview The Freeview brand was launched in November 2008 with teaser commercials promising 15 channels in 2009. The first new \\"Freeview\\" channel started on 26 March 2009 with Network Ten's One sports channel. Further advertising began on 26 April 2009, with the first Freeview certified devices appearing in retailers from May 2009. In June 2010, the second phase of devices, marked as \\"Freeview EPG\\" devices, became available in retail stores, designed to work with the newly launched interactive EPG built on MHEG-5. This Freeview EPG will cease operating on 24 November 2017. =Satellite & Cable= Foxtel Foxtel has been carrying HD channels since 2008. it has over 20 HD channels, a mix of basic and premium subscription, free-to-air and free-to-view services.

Breathless, imbalanced genius.\\" BrooklynVegan staffer Rob Sperry-Fromm says \\"There's a classical doom feel... wedded to a modern sense of progressiveness, with reverb-y harmonies and organ melding creating a vivid contrast with the driving, powerful drumming of new member Rae Amitay.\\" According to the Invisible Oranges staff, \\"[Melynda] Jackson's chiming and piercing guitar tone evokes The Edge's celebratory playing style. She and [Haley] Westeiner employ two-part harmonies, the sort often used in medieval choir music...

It is a rural local government body at the Tehsil (taluka) level in India. It works for the villages of the tehsil that together are called a development block. The Panchayat Samiti is the link between the gram panchayat (village council) and the zila parishad (district board). There are a number of variations in the name of this institution in the various states. For example, it is known as Kshetra Panchayat in Uttar Pradesh, Mandal Parishad in Andhra Pradesh, Taluka Panchayat in Gujarat, and Mandal Panchayat in Karnataka.  Composition  500px Typically, a panchayat samiti is composed of elected members of the area, and the Block Development Officer, otherwise unrepresented members (representatives of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and women), associate members (such as a farmer of the area, a representative of the cooperative societies, and one from the agricultural marketing services sector), and the elected members of that panchayat block (tehsil) on the zila parishad (district board). The samiti is elected for five years and is headed by a Block Pramukh(President) elected by the members of the panchayat samiti.  Departments  The most common departments found in a panchayat samiti are: # Administration # Finance # Public works (especially water and roads) # Agriculture # Health # Education # Social welfare # Information Technology # Women & Child Development # Panchayat raj ( Mandal Praja Parishad ) Each department in a panchayat samiti has its own officer, most often these are state government employees acting as extension officers, but occasionally in more revenue-rich panchayat samiti, these may be local employees. A government appointed block development officer (BDO) is the supervisor of the extension officers, and executive officer to the panchayat samiti and becomes, in effect, its administrative chief over all operations.  Functions  Panchayat Samiti collects all the prospective plans prepared at Gram Panchayat level and processes them for funding and implementation by evaluating them from the angles of financial constraints, social welfare and area development. It also identifies and prioritize the issues which needs to be addressed at block level.  Sources of income  The income of the panchayat samiti comes from four sources: # taxes levied upon land and water usage, professional taxes, liquor taxes and others # income generating programmes # grants-in-aid and loans from the State Government and the local zila parishad # voluntary contributions For many of the panchayat samiti the main source of income becomes state aid. For others, the traditional taxing function provides the bulk of revenues.

Hosts Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies of Pterygodermatites peromysci have not been conducted yet, but might provide scientists with an understanding about how the it causes pathology in the gastrointestinal tract of the host, as worms have been found in vitro as large as 38 mm in a host mouse with a body length size of 90 mm. In a case where 8 of these adult worms were discovered in a mouse it was noted that the mouse had a very inflamed and damaged gut from the internal damage of pressure on host tissues (1). However, scanning electron microscopy studies have been conducted on Pterygodermatites bovieri in which the definitive host is bats (2) and on Pterygodermatites mesopectines which has been noted to parasitize a commensal rodent, Mastomys natalensis (3) so a comparison SEM study of the morphology of the head of P. peromysci with previously SEM studied species may present interesting results since SEM studies of the Pterygodermatites species which infects a rodent (Mastomys natalensis) has already been worked out. Life cycle Though a scanning electron microscopy study of P. peromysci hasn‚Äôt been worked out, there do exist stereo microscope images of the morphology of the egg with a hatching third stage infectious juvenile which infect white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, (Figure 2, source 4). Parasitic infection of the definitive mouse occurs once the encysted egg in the haemocoel of the intermediate host, a camel cricket, is ingested via mouse based predation of the intermediate host. To complete this life cycle characteristic of nematodes in the family Rictulariidae, P. peromysci larvae migrates into the gastrointestinal tract, molting into a 4th stage juvenile and then into an adult. The life cycle is continued when the mouse sheds its embryonated eggs into the environment (Figure 1, source 4). What is notable about this life-cycle is that the eggs are embryonated, rather than non-embryonated, when they are passed into the environment. Since the intermediate host is most abundant during the months of August ‚Äì September, the prevalence of infection in these mice is greatest during the end of the summer months. Furthermore, the eggs are able to survive the winter, hatch in the spring, and then continue the infection cycle with the camel crickets (4). However though P. peromysci has been more commonly observed in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), it has also been reported identified using flying squirrels as its definitive host such as the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) and the southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) which illustrates that there is more than one possible definitive host for P. peromysci (5). Distribution P. peromysci has been discovered in Florida and in Pennsylvania primarily in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). Geographically the infected mice have been shown to be abundant in flatwood habitats of Florida, characterized by poorly draining soils which may have standing water during rainy seasons. Here, the vegetation is usually rather diverse. In other places infected mice have been identified in the hardwood forests of Pennsylvania (3, 6). Further complicating the life- cycle, but still with regard to geographical distribution, P. peromysci adults have been identified in New York as well as in Pennsylvania in flying squirrel populations. In the flying squirrel hosts, another parasite, Strongyloides robustus was also identified. The scientists hypothesized that perhaps initial infection with S. robustus via skin penetration of the flying squirrel host might alter the immune response of the host in such a way which encourages co- infection of the gastrointestinal tract with P. peromysci (5). Furthermore, in the flying squirrels the pathology wasn‚Äôt deemed severe from spleen masses collected from the squirrels as the spleens were not appreciably enlarged from pathology. Perhaps the reduced pathology in this case is due to parasitic competition between S. robustus and P. peromysci as S. robustus takes most of the chemical resources from P. peromysci as S. robustus was most abundant in all the specimens co-infected with the two parasites. =Zoonosis?= Perhaps since the life-cycle of P. peromysci in its definitive host involves predation of crickets, parasitism in humans is not a predominant problem in countries such as the United States where consumption of insects is not a common- practice (4). This may explain why the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has not published any online reports on human infection by P. peromysci. While this may not prove that it definitely has never infected humans, it may explain the current absence of observed zoonosis findings or the need for human treatment. =Treatment of infected mice= In a field study to determine if there was sex-biased infection towards male mice, female and male mice were separated into groups and administered an antihelminthic drug to clear the infection of P. peromysci adults in infected rodents to test if males or females released more infectious eggs ingested by cricket intermediate hosts. The antihelminthic drug was levamisole hydrochloride which when tested in the infected mice was shown to be able to control and prevent infection of P. peromysci in both the male and female mice for up to 2 weeks optimally, but no longer than 4 weeks for the dose given (7). Probably after 2 weeks of the treatment dose (36 mg / kg) the free mice were susceptible to reinfection. References Sources 1) Vandegrift, K. J., & Hudson, P. J. (2009).

A missionary, he founded the Shaker communities of Canterbury, New Hampshire, and Enfield, New Hampshire.  Biography  = Early life = Bishop was born on September 29, 1760 in Stamford, Connecticut, United States. In 1779, according to Shaker Elder Henry C. Blinn, Bishop became interested in a \\"religious revival\\", just around a decade before the beginning of the Second Great Awakening. He later recorded an account of his experiences and conversion to Shakerism, writing: > \\"I entered fully into the spirit of the work and received great light. > Although zealous prayers and religious exercises often had the effect to > produce spiritual impressions, yet they were not permanent, and left me a > subject to temptations. We passed the winter exhorting each other to > faithfulness, while we anxiously waited for the accomplishment of the > prophetic spirit of the revival. > In the spring of 1780 we learned of a people near the city of Albany, NY, > who were reported to have received a singular kind of religion, and that > they possessed a large degree of divine light and spiritual power. Many went > out to see them and returned fully persuaded that they were the true > witnesses of God. The work increased and I felt a great desire to satisfy > myself concerning these strangers and their religion. > In June, in company with several others, I made them a visit. We arrived on > Saturday evening and remained till Monday. We attended their meetings. The > singing was inspiring, the speaking powerful and heart-searching. The wisdom > of their instruction, the purity of their doctrine, and the Christ-like > simplicity of their deportment all reminded me of the apostolic faith. I saw > that the work was of God, and my salvation depended upon it. > The cross that was before me was an evidence of the spirit of the testimony. > On the one hand, the prospects of the world were flattering to my mind. I > was in the prime of life and in the vigor of health. My reputation was fair, > and my hopes not unpromising. > On the other hand, religion had been my pursuit. The revival had raised my > hopes and directed my faith to a greater and more glorious work. I > subsequently made another visit and was received with kindness. I confessed > my sins to God, and with a fixed resolution accepted the cross of Christ. I > was now taught to rectify every wrong that I had committed, to forsake all > sin and to take up a daily cross. \\" > I also became better acquainted with Mother Ann and the Elders who were with > her, and am a witness of the purity of life which they constantly > maintained. The doctrine they taught was strictly conformable to the > precepts and example of Jesus Christ. By obeying their instruction I > experienced the truth of their testimony. I was blessed with heavenly > visions and felt my faith established on a sure foundation. > I visited Mother Ann and the Elders many times at Watervliet, Harvard, > Ashfield, Hancock, and New Lebanon, and freely associated with all the > leading members of the Society. To my great satisfaction I have seen that > the principles which were first taught by Mother Ann have been faithfully > kept by her successors.\\" = Early ministry = Many members of the Bishop family became Shakers, joining the Mount Lebanon Shaker Society in New York at its founding in 1787, later becoming very influential in its leadership. In the late 1780s, Bishop was part of a group of young men and women chosen by Father Joseph Meacham, third leader of the Shakers, to be the future leaders of the religion. In 1788, he moved to the Mount Lebanon to assist Father Meacham. The young Bishop was described at the time in The Shaker Manifesto as: > Erect and well proportioned, being about five feet and ten inches in hight. > His hair was dark chestnut and very strait , his nose of the Roman type and > his eyes a brilliant black. His voice in speaking was keyed higher than is > usual for men and yet those who listened to the power and spirit of his > exhortations soon learned that he was a living servant of God. He was > remarkably gifted and endowed with the prophetic spirit in an eminent > degree. Between 1782 and 1791, Bishop was tasked, among others, with visiting the New Hampshire Shakers to serve as a minister. It was anticipated that the task of organizing into communities the Shakers in that state would be given to Elder Henry Clough. Clough was originally commissioned to organize the new Hampshire communities in 1788, but Father Joseph Meacham, leader of the Shakers, reversed his decision, deciding that Clough was more valuable back at Mount Lebanon Shaker Society. Clough returned to Mount Lebanon and became Father Meacham's second-in-command. = Leadership in New Hampshire = In 1791, Bishop was sent to New Hampshire to gather the Shakers there into \\"Gospel order\\", a Quaker/Shaker term referring to communal harmony. He facing difficulty doing so, however, and returned to Mount Lebanon, depressed and seeking guidance. Father Meacham sent him to meet with Elder Clough, who assured Bishop that he was the right man for the job, and that he himself (Clough) was needed more at the Mount Lebanon. Bishop accepted Clough's counseling, and Father Meacham allowed Clough to accompany Bishop on his next trip. On the road, Bishop again became depressed, falling behind Clough on the trail. Clough comforted him yet again, saying: > \\"Go, Job, you will have a gift in your ministration. I will return.\\" Clough turned around and headed back to Mount Lebanon, while Bishop continued the journey alone. Later that year, after his initial success in instilling \\"Gospel order\\", Bishop would be given leadership of the New Hampshire Shakers. In February 1792, Bishop, along with Brother Edward Lougee and Sisters Hannah Goodrich and Anna Burdick, was sent from the Mount Lebanon community the Central Ministry of the Shakers to be the first \\"Lead\\", or leader, of the new Canterbury Shaker Village. He was young at the time, in his late 20s, but was chosen because Meacham appreciated, according to Brother John Ward, a member of the Shakers' Harvard community, that: > \\"[Job Bishop] was always very careful to acknowledge the lead placed before > him whether young or old, and in a peculiar manner was extremely careful to > pattern the gift and order of things in the Mother Church.\\" Still, sources indicate his promotion to such a leadership position was controversial. Some Shakers still believed that Elder Clough would have been a better choice to lead the New Hampshire communities. Bishop himself experienced doubts, but was able to continue with his mission. Bishop reached Canterbury, New Hampshire and organized the community there during 1792. Bishop remained in New Hampshire after establishing the Canterbury Society, and less than a year later, organized the Enfield community. He remained in New Hampshire long thereafter, residing at the Canterbury or Enfield community. In addition to his leadership, Bishop was also a prolific craftsman, specializing in chair and cabinetmaking. Several of his wooden circular boxes are currently featured in a collection of Shaker furniture and crafts at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. = Later life and death = In 1795, Bishop was conferred upon the title of \\"Father\\", which designates the highest rank of leadership in the Shaker Church. One of Bishop's best remembered moments was his greeting of United States President James Monroe on the occasion of the President's 1817 visit to the Enfield Society during his tour of New England. Bishop, in a famed example of what was considered the Shakers' \\"characteristic\\" style of speech, received the President with the simple words: > \\"I, Job Bishop, welcome James Monroe to our habitation.\\" Bishop died on December 5, 1831 in Canterbury Shaker Village, aged 72 years, two months, and six days. He was the last survivor of the original leaders sent out by Father Meacham in 1792, having served the Shakers of New Hampshire for over 40 years.

It has also been known as The Jefferson Hotel. It was built from 1922 to 1923, and was initially an apartment building. After housing war workers during World War II, the structure was converted to a hotel in 1954. Although not noted for its luxury at that time, it was the favorite of theater and movie stars, musicians, and top government officials. It became better known for its luxury accommodations after a 1980 renovation, and became a Washington landmark. It was sold in 1989, 2000, and 2005, and underwent a two-year, multimillion-dollar renovation that revealed the building's original atrium skylight. It reopened in 2009. The hotel is rated five stars by Forbes Travel Guide. U.S. News & World Report rated it the second-best luxury hotel in the United States in January 2016. Apartment building history The F. H. Smith Corporation, a local real estate developer of apartment and office buildings, began construction on The Jefferson, an eight-story, 74-unit apartment building, in July 1922. Cost of construction was $900,000 ($ in dollars), and the building was originally owned by The Jefferson Corporation. The architect was Jules Henri de Sibour, who designed the building in the Beaux-Arts architectural style. The building was named for Thomas Jefferson, the former President of the United States and Founding Father. In April 1930, The Jefferson Corp. was forced into bankruptcy by its creditors. As the trial progressed, evidence emerged that the F. H. Smith Corp. had signed secret agreements to allow its chairman, G. Bryan Pitts, to occupy an entire floor of the building (17 rooms, including five baths) rent-free, which had caused The Jefferson Corporation's financial difficulties. Pitts and other F. H. Smith officers were charged with embezzlement. As the trial continued, a former Smith Corp. officer testified that he had destroyed evidence to cover up the crime. Pitts and several others were found guilty and sentenced to 23 years in prison.; ; ; ; In 1931, Alfred Robinson Glancy, a General Motors executive, purchased the building from the bankrupt Jefferson Corp. for an undisclosed sum. Hotel history =Glancy ownership= The Jefferson partially converted to a hotel in 1941 to serve workers mobilizing for a potential war with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. It provided both short-term rentals (like a hotel) and residential needs. It eliminated its residential services and converted completely into a hotel in 1955. Glancy died in 1959, and in 1960 his heirs purchased 1214 16th Street NW, a four-story building adjacent to the north side of the hotel, for use as office space. By 1963, The Jefferson's 74 rooms had been subdivided, creating 150 hotel rooms. The hotel's main floor sported a dining room and cocktail lounge named \\"The Elbow Room\\". The hotel was not considered luxurious by the standards of the day, but it had a great deal of cachet with artists, musicians, theater and movie stars, and top domestic and foreign government officials. Among those who stayed there in the 1950s were actress Helen Hayes, actor Tyrone Power and orchestra conductor Leopold Stokowski. =Williams ownership= In March 1963, Glancy's heirs sold The Jefferson to the American Realty Trust Co. of Arlington, Virginia, for $1 million ($ in dollars). Famous guests at the hotel in the 1960s included comedian and pianist Victor Borge, actress Carol Channing, pianist Van Cliburn, actress Vivien Leigh, theatrical producer David Merrick, and writer Katherine Anne Porter. American Realty Trust sold The Jefferson in January 1976 to attorney and sports team owner Edward Bennett Williams for $1.8 million ($ in dollars). By this time, the hotel had created a number of large suites out of some of the smaller rooms, leaving the hotel with just 98 rooms and suites. Williams began to improve the hotel's luxuriousness, emphasizing its \\"European style\\" and immaculate rooms. In 1980, Williams began a multimillion-dollar, two-year renovation of the hotel. The renovation replaced most of the guest-room and public space furniture with antiques, and original American artwork from the past 200 years graced walls throughout the hotel. Williams also built an extensive collection of documents signed by the hotel's namesake, Thomas Jefferson. Williams was a confidante of a number of presidents (Republican and Democrat), and The Jefferson became a favorite hotel of top officials in the Reagan administration. The hotel's reputation for discretion continued to attract some of the most famous visitors to the city, and in the 1980s actress Candice Bergen, writer William F. Buckley Jr., economist John Kenneth Galbraith, film director Louis Malle, and actor Jason Robards stayed there. Members of President George H. W. Bush's family stayed there prior to Bush's inauguration as President, and the president-elect chose most of his cabinet while staying at The Jefferson. The hotel was also the home of former Senator John Tower during confirmation hearings for his unsuccessful 1989 nomination as United States Secretary of Defense. Radio talk show host Larry King broadcast from the hotel the first Friday every month in the mid and late 1980s. =Value Enhancement Fund III ownership= Edward Bennett Williams died in August 1988, and his widow, Agnes Williams, sought to sell the hotel. Rose Narva, the hotel's long-time and popular managing director, organized a consortium of investors to purchase the hotel for $25 million ($ in dollars) and retain her as the manager. Her bid was topped by the Aoki Corp., a Japanese construction and real estate investment company, which signed a letter of intent in February 1989 to purchase the \\"landmark\\" hotel for $30 million ($ in dollars). The company subsequently backed out of the purchase agreement, apparently after real estate experts said the $30 million price would have been far too high. In April 1989, Paine Webber Realty (a subsidiary of the Paine Webber stock brokerage firm) purchased the hotel from Agnes Williams for $28 million ($ in dollars). This was a record per-room price for a hotel in Washington, D.C., at the time. Paine Webber Realty acted as the agent for Value Enhancement Fund III, a group of Japanese institutional investors. The fund subsequently hired the Lancaster Group, owner and manager of luxury hotels nationwide, to manage the hotel when Narva's contract expired in 1990. By this time, the hotel was charging anywhere from $175 ($ in dollars) a night for a standard room to $1,000 ($ in dollars) a night for its William French Smith Suite (which was named after the former U.S. Attorney General who once lived in the hotel). The expense of running the luxury property, however, was high, and The Jefferson generated just $550,000 ($ in dollars) a year in earnings in 1989. A year after the Lancaster Group took over, rates for a standard room had risen to $200 ($ in dollars) to $340 ($ in dollars) a night. The hotel underwent another multimillion-dollar refurbishment about 1999. Each room now featured an extensive built-in mini-bar, two telephone lines, a built-in music center, Internet access, and a fax machine. In November 2000, Value Enhancement Fund III hired Loews Hotels to manage The Jefferson. George W. Bush stayed in the hotel prior to his 2001 inauguration as President, and the fund renovated the hotel again later that year. As part of the refurbishment, each room now received its own unique set of furniture and furnishings. This included canopy beds and mahogany and hickory armoires with built-in mini- bars, and the wood-burning fireplaces (in those rooms equipped with them) were restored to operation. Each room was also outfitted with a television, marble bathroom sinks, and new bed frames and mattresses. The hotel continued to attract entertainers throughout the 1990s and 2000s, such as singer and actress Barbra Streisand (who stayed there in the early 1990s). =DC CAP Hotelier ownership= The Jefferson undergoing renovation in 2009. The Jefferson was purchased in June 2005 by DC CAP Hotelier, a New York-based real estate firm. Loews managed the hotel until July 2005, after which the owners hired Kor Hotel Group, a Los Angeles-based manager of luxury hotels, as the hotel's new overseer. By now, The Jefferson had 32 suites, and had created about of meeting space. This space was divided among five rooms, which had occupancy limits ranging from 15 to 150 people. Kor Hotel Group began a major redesign of the hotel in 2005, and The Jefferson closed in March 2007 to begin its overhaul. During the renovations, the building's skylight was uncovered for the first time in decades, and the lobby's dropped ceiling was removed to expose the original barrel vault. Many of the building's structural elements were repaired, strengthened, and upgraded, and the HVAC and mechanical systems gutted and replaced. The hotel was expected to reopen on September 1, 2008, but much more structural deterioration had occurred than was anticipated and the hotel did not reopen until August 2009. Renovated guest bathrooms now featured television screens embedded in the mirrors and deep \\"soaker\\" bathtubs, while guest living and sleeping spaces now featured individualized custom drapes and custom-designed beds covered in European linens featuring images of Jefferson's Virginia home, Monticello. The overall feel of guest- rooms was meant to reflect a Paris apartment. The hotel cocktail lounge was completely remodeled as well, and now featured an orange colored bar countertop of molded glass embedded with optical fibers that made it glow. The hotel retained its Federalist interior design style in its public spaces, including the unique antique furniture, artwork, and displays of Jefferson- signed documents. New amenities included a butler assigned to each guest-room, and room service trays containing microchips that alerted staff whenever the tray was deposited in a hallway. The cost of the renovation was not disclosed. The Jefferson continued to emphasize its discretion and private nature after the 2008‚Äì2009 renovation. The hotel increased its prices after the renovation by about $100 ($ in dollars) a night. Off-season standard guest-room rates ran from $380 ($ in dollars) to $450 ($ in dollars) a night, while height-of- season rates ranged from $450 ($ in dollars) to $650 ($ in dollars). Suites went for $850 ($ in dollars) a night. The new prices made The Jefferson one of Washington's priciest hotels, alongside the Four Seasons and The Ritz-Carlton. Dining and amenities The Jefferson has 99 rooms, which includes 20 suites. Rates for standard guest rooms began at $375 a night in January 2016. Some suites have small, private balconies with views of the Washington Monument. Two master suites, the Thomas Jefferson Suite and the Martha Jefferson Suite, occupy the top floors. The larger is the Thomas Jefferson Suite, which has five balconies and contains of space. The Jefferson's cocktail lounge is known as Quill, and Forbes Travel Guide said it is rumored to be President Barack Obama's favorite hotel space in Washington, D.C. The Jefferson has two restaurants, the more upscale Plume and the less formal The Greenhouse. Several small private rooms, capable of seating two or three people, open onto Plume to accommodate more private discussions among guests. Plume received four stars from Forbes Travel Guide. Since 2014, Ralf Schlegel has been the executive chef at Plume, which received a Michelin Star in the 2017 Michelin Guide for Washington, D.C. The ground floor of the hotel also features the Book Room, a reading library stocked with books either printed in the late 1700s and early 1800s or whose content reflects Jefferson's personal interests. The hotel has four private, obscure entrances for its celebrity or security-conscious guests. Rating In 2010, The Jefferson was admitted into Relais & Ch√¢teaux, a global association of luxury hotels. Forbes Travel Guide (formerly known as Mobil Guide) awarded the hotel four out of five stars in 2016. In January 2016, U.S. News & World Report ranked The Jefferson Hotel the second-best hotel in the United States. The hotel had ranked tenth in 2015 and 99th in 2014.

These rules simulate actions in the second world war on the Western or Eastern fronts during the final two years of the war for forces up to Corps or Army Levels. The basic units in the game are tank and mechanised infantry platoons, infantry companies, and artillery batteries. Aircraft may be in flights or squadrons. Logistics and engineers are fully covered. Overview Bruce Rea Taylor and Andy Ashton originally intended that Korps Commander would be the start of a family of rules, each covering a period and location, as can be seen by the quote from the Rules. The Road to Berlin was the first and last of the Korps Commander publications. Bruce Rea Taylor Bruce Rea Taylor died shortly after the publication of these rules (1989), at the age of 40. I was unable to find any evidence Andy Ashton made any plans to continue this project. Korps Commander used the Corps Commander: OMG (Operational Manoeuvre Group) game system, which was published in 1986. The differences between these two rules are summarized in the Introduction of Korps Commander. Bruce Rea Taylor gives a special mention to the Wallasey Wargames Club in the Introduction of the Korps Commander Rules. The primary significance of these rules was it was one of the first game systems which used a scale of 1-2 base(s) per company. The reason why a scale of 1 base per company was not used was to allow for small formations, such as 1-2 SP-AA weapons allocated to a HQ and to ensure the record keeping for the standard company sized formations was not too difficult. However, apart from this, the rules attempted to use a 1 Base = 1 company scale, which allowed players to command one, or more, divisions. Compared with the most common rules used in this period, this was unusual. In practice the detail and complexity of the rules precluded any possibility of playing a corps level game within a reasonable time frame. Most games would typically field 50 bases, or elements, per side. This represents a force of 25 companies per side. A game of this size which consisted of 24 game-turns, or one game day duration, could be completed within a 4-8 hour period. History Bruce Rea Taylor and Andy Ashton published Corps Commander in July 1986. This used the same game system as Korps Commander and can be considered the first of the Corps/Korps Commander system publications. In October 1986 \\"Digest #3, Engineering Equipment Data, Engineering Lists, Engineering Scenarios\\" was published, this contained additional material for Corps Commander. In June 1988 \\"Corps Commander: By Air & Sea\\" was published, containing yet more supporting material for Corps Commander. The final publication in this family was in August 1988 when \\"Korps Commander\\" was published. While Bruce Rea Taylor published a number of additional books after August 1988, they were all dated after his death on the 3rd of March 1989.Bruce Rea-Taylor (1948‚Äì1989) No additional Corp/Korps Commander books were published after August 1988. These post August 1988 publications are listed here: * Digest #4, Ultra Modern Army Lists for Challenger II Rules, Apr 1989 (For Challenger II) * Digest #5, Ultra Modern Army Lists for Challenger II Rules, June 1989 (For Challenger II) There is strong evidence Bruce Rea Taylor built on his earlier rules, Challenger and Firefly, when developing the Corp/Korps Commander Rules. This is especially evident in the equipment specification. Players in the last 20 years have used these earlier rules to expand Corps/Korps Commander, such as can be seen in the \\"nikita - Corps Commander: OMG and Korps Kommander\\" site referenced earlier, and attempts to rewrite the rules as can be seen with Korps-Kommandeur.Korps-Kommandeur io Group Scale Ground Scale (1/300 scale) : Each centimetre represents 50 metres (1:5000) Game-Turn Scale : Each daylight Turn represents 1/2 hour of actual time. Each night Turn represents 1 hour of actual time. Base/Stand Scale - Each base represents a company, part of a company or a platoon. A Base can have a maximum of 9 Strength points. (If there are more than 9 vehicles or Gun's in a Company, the Company is split into two bases, each of which are similar in strength. This system allows a base to also represent a platoon, such as a support platoon attached to a Headquarters company.) * Vehicle Scale : Each AFV Strength point represents 1 AFV. * Artillery Scale : Each Artillery Strength point represents 1 weapon. * Infantry Scale : Each Infantry Strength Point represents approximately 10 combat troops, or 1 heavy weapon. * Aircraft Scale : Each Aircraft Strength Points represents 1 aircraft. Base Size (1/300 scale) - A Base which has 1 to 5 strength points has a size of 20mm by 30mm. A Base with more than 5 strength points has a size of 30mm by 30mm. For comparison purposes the earlier Corps Commander used a Ground scale of 10 cm = 1 km (1:10000) and a Daylight Game Turn = 1 hour. Lightning War - Red Storm uses a base size of 30 cm x 30 cm, a ground scale of 1 cm = 100, (1:10000), a Daylight Game Turn = 2 hours. Panzer Korps, while designed for 15mm/20mm, uses a Ground Scale of 1 cm = 50m (1:5000) for 1/300 scale. Significance The primary significance of these rules is the use of a 1 Company = 1-2 Base(s) scale. In 1986/1988 this was unusual. Examples of other similar scaled rules are, Great Battles of WWII Vol. 1 (1995),CWP and CWG rules and reference guides Panzer Korps (2004).Panzer Korps : Welcome to the Official Divisional Warfare website and Lightning War - Red Storm (2001-2008). The most common scale in the late 80's was 1 Vehicle = 1 Base, later rules used scales of 1 Platoon = 1 Base. The primary issue with the increase of the scale was related to the combat specifications of a base. When a base represents a common vehicle or gun, its speed and combat capabilities are based on the figure itself. When a base represents a mix of vehicles or guns, its speed and combat capabilities may differ from the figure on the base. Example : A Base which contains 5 x Pz I and 2 x Pz II compared with another base which contains 5 x Pz I and 2 x Pz III. Both would be represented by a Pz I, but would differ in combat capabilities. Players may be required to keep track of the combat capabilities of individual bases by the use of separate written records, or a value printed on the base. In this case the use of a Board-Game system may be preferable. Corps/Korps Commander resolved this issue by giving each a Base a value, representing the number of common vehicles or guns. When there were different vehicles or guns in a company, the company would be represented by more than 1 base. Each Base would contain the same vehicle/guns and its value would be the number of vehicle/gun in each base.

Nungesser was found not responsible by a university inquiry. In May 2014, Sulkowicz filed a report against Nungesser with the New York Police Department (NYPD), who did not pursue charges. The district attorney's office interviewed both students, but did not pursue charges, citing lack of reasonable suspicion. Sulkowicz declined to pursue criminal charges any further, and stated that NYPD officers were dismissive and had mistreated her. After Columbia declined to take action against Nungesser, Sulkowicz produced a work of performance art entitled Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight) as a senior thesis, which involved Sulkowicz carrying a 50-pound dorm mattress on campus to represent the painful burden rape victims carry throughout daily life, and in protest of what Sulkowicz described as Columbia University's mishandling of the sexual assault complaint. Nungesser called Sulkowicz's allegations untrue, citing as evidence behavior Nungesser said was counterintuitive, such as friendly texts Sulkowicz sent Nungesser days after the alleged attack occurred, and described the mattress piece as an act of bullying intended to force him to leave Columbia.Van Syckle, Katie (20 January 2015). \\"Alleged Columbia Rapist 'Dismayed and Disappointed' by Accuser‚Äôs SOTU Invitation\\", New York Magazine, January 2015; accessed May 29, 2016. In April 2015, Nungesser filed a Title IX gender discrimination lawsuit against Columbia, its board of trustees, its president Lee Bollinger, and Sulkowicz's supervising art professor Jon Kessler, alleging that Columbia had facilitated gender based harassment by allowing Sulkowicz to receive course credit for the performance. Federal District Court Judge Gregory H. Woods dismissed the lawsuit but allowed Nungesser to refile an amended suit, which was settled by Columbia in July 2017. In 2017, the university issued a statement acknowledging that Nungesser experienced a very difficult time, promised to keep its gender-based misconduct policies fair, and settled Nungesser's lawsuit under undisclosed terms. Emma Sulkowicz Sulkowicz in December 2014 Emma Sulkowicz (born October 3, 1992 in New York City),\\"Carry That Weight\\", Emma Sulkowicz interviewed by Roberta Smith, Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, December 2014, c. 48:50 mins. attended The Dalton School on the Upper East Side where she was an A student and competitive fencer. In 2011 she began her undergraduate studies at Columbia University as a visual arts major.Grigoriadis, Vanessa (September 21, 2014). \\"Meet the College Women Who Are Starting a Revolution Against Campus Sexual Assault\\", New York Magazine; accessed May 29, 2016. Sulkowicz identifies as non-binary and sometimes uses they/them pronouns. Paul Nungesser Paul Jonathan Nungesser (German: Nunge√üer;Christoph Cadenbach: Nachtschatten, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, Heft 5/2015.Ulrike Demmer, Susann Remke: \\"Ich habe Emma nicht vergewaltigt\\", Focus Magazin Nr. 7/2015. born 1991 in Berlin) is a German citizen who studied architecture at Columbia. Allegations =Allegations by Sulkowicz= On April 18, 2013, Sulkowicz reported to Columbia's Office of Gender-Based and Sexual Misconduct that, on the first day of their sophomore year on August 27, 2012, in Sulkowicz's dorm room, she was raped by fellow student Nungesser. Describing the alleged rape, Sulkowicz said that what began as a consensual sexual encounter in Sulkowicz's room turned non-consensual. Sulkowicz alleged that Nungesser choked her, slapped her face, held her wrists, and anally raped her, while Sulkowicz struggled and told him to stop. Sulkowicz said that after the alleged assault, Nungesser immediately left the room without speaking. He and Sulkowicz both corroborate that they had consensual sex twice before, earlier in the year, but not anal sex. Nungesser said that the encounter in August was also entirely consensual, and he denied the allegations of violence, stating that they briefly had consensual anal sex, followed by other sexual activity, after which they fell asleep, saying he left the room early in the morning while Sulkowicz was still sleeping. Afterwards they communicated via Facebook messages. Nungesser later described these messages as \\"amiable\\" and showed transcripts of these messages to Cathy Young, a contributor for The Daily Beast who has been critical of campus sexual assault activism. Sulkowicz expressed concern that the messages would be used to present them as unreliable, and stated they had sent them because they were upset and wanted to talk to him about the incident but decided against doing so. By the time of Sulkowicz's last message, sent in March 2013, they had visited the university's Office of Gender-Based Misconduct and was asked whether they had tried talking to the accused. A university spokesperson said in February 2015 that its gender-based misconduct policy does not recommend informal resolution or mediation for such complaints. In response to criticisms regarding the delay in reporting, Sulkowicz said they initially didn't report the incident to avoid emotional trauma. =Allegations from others= Three other complaints have been alleged against Nungesser: a second woman accused him of emotional abuse and nonconsensual sex during a months-long relationship, a third student accused him of non-consensually kissing her and touching her at a party, and a fourth accuser emerged in early 2015, a fourth-year male student who said Nungesser sexually assaulted him after an emotional conversation. The second accuser's investigation was discontinued after she said she was \\"exhausted by the barrage of questions\\" and stopped responding to emails from the University's Title IX coordinator for sexual assault investigations. In early 2013 Sulkowicz discussed the incident with \\"Natalie\\", Nungesser's former girlfriend. Natalie alleged that there had been non-consensual sex and emotional abuse during her relationship with Nungesser, which lasted from October 2011 to spring 2012. Nungesser denies that charge and describes their time together as a couple as a \\"difficult relationship\\". Sulkowicz said that the conversation with Natalie prompted them to file a formal complaint to the university. Sulkowicz filed a complaint on April 18, 2013 and Natalie filed one a few days later. The third complaint from a student identified as \\"Josie\\" was initially decided against Nungesser, with an assigned punishment of disciplinary probation, but Nungesser successfully appealed, citing procedural errors and problems with the admission of hearsay. Nungesser further appealed on grounds that his accuser had failed to demonstrate guilt by a \\"preponderance of the evidence\\" as required in campus hearings. He says the allegations, which were all brought within days of each other, were the result of collusion and are fraudulent. The three women said in interviews with The New York Times that they decided to file formal complaints with the school after they heard about one another's experiences. The fourth student, identified as \\"Adam\\", said he first reported the incident to the group to which they both belonged, and then he filed a Title IX complaint. Columbia also investigated the complaint and found Nungesser \\"not responsible\\". According to Cathy Young, the investigators found contradictions in Adam's statements and Facebook dialogs between the men. Outcome of Sulkowicz's hearing, Nungesser's first complaints On October 29, the day after Nungesser's third accuser's hearing, one was scheduled for Sulkowicz's case. In November the university found Paul Nungesser \\"not responsible\\". Sulkowicz's request for an appeal was turned down by the dean. Sulkowicz and Nungesser both complained separately about the proceedings. Sulkowicz complained that Nungesser was granted months of postponements during the hearing, and that they were not allowed to discuss the case with anyone. Sulkowicz said that a university investigator asked inappropriate questions during the interview, and complained that the panel did not consider other allegations against the accused student. A graduate student who acted as Nungesser's official supporter during the hearing defended the panel, disputing that their questions were inappropriate, saying the questions \\"were extremely personal because they had to be\\". Nungesser complained that he had not been allowed to introduce Facebook messages as evidence. Nungesser and Sulkowicz exchanged several messages in the days and weeks after the alleged rape. In one message, two days after the alleged rape, Sulkowicz accepted an invitation to a party from Nungesser, writing: \\"I feel like we need to have some real time where we can talk about life and thingz, because we still haven't really had a paul- emma chill sesh since summmmerrrr.\\" Sulkowicz says they sent the messages because they were upset and wanted to talk to Nungesser about the incident.Zeilinger, Julie (February 3, 2015). \\"The Treatment of Emma Sulkowicz Proves We Still Have No Idea How to Talk About Rape\\", mic.com; accessed May 28, 2016. Reporter Katie Zavadski, writing for New York Magazine, opined that amicable exchanges with an alleged attacker didn't disprove that a sexual assault occurred, and Cathy Young acknowledged that victims of sexual violence may cope with trauma in ways that could seem puzzling to outsiders. Press break, publicity and federal complaint The New York Post broke the story in December 2013, without naming either party.Palmeri, Tara (December 11, 2013). Columbia drops ball on jock 'rapist' probe: students\\", New York Post, December 11, 2013; accessed May 29, 2016. On April 7, 2014 Sulkowicz appeared with U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) at a press conference about sexual assault on campus, telling reporters that Sulkowicz had been raped.\\"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand Seeks Funds To Fight College Campus Sex Assaults\\", CBS New York, April 7, 2014.Press release , gillibrand.senate.gov, April 7, 2014. On April 24, Sulkowicz and 22 other students (later joined by five others) filed a 100-page federal complaint alleging that Columbia University and Barnard College mishandled their sexual-assault complaints, in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights law to ensure gender equality on campuses. The complaint alleged that the universities were in violation of Title II, a provision against discrimination by a public body on the basis of disability,Pryal, Katie Rose Guest (January 15, 2015). \\"Where Title IX meets Title II\\", Chronicle Vitae. and the Clery Act, which requires federally financed universities to disclose campus crime statistics.Bogler, Emma (April 24, 2014). \\"Students file federal complaint against Columbia, alleging Title IX, Title II, Clery Act violations\\", Columbia Spectator.

The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights opened two investigations in January 2015 into the Title IX and Title II complaints against Columbia. On May 3, 2014 an interview with Sulkowicz appeared on the front page of The New York Times. For several days from May 7 onwards, Paul Nungesser's name was included within lists of \\"sexual assault violators\\" written on the walls or doors of campus bathrooms, or on flyers.Abby Abrams (May 13, 2014). \\"List of 'sexual assault violators' written in Hamilton, Lerner, Butler bathrooms\\", Columbia Spectator. On May 14, Sulkowicz filed a report with the NYPD. Columbia's student newspaper, the Columbia Daily Spectator, controversially published the accused student's name two days later.Abrams, Abby and Lau, Steven (May 16, 2014). \\"Why we published the name of an alleged rapist\\", Columbia Spectator. The editors stated that they felt it would be \\"irresponsible to keep his name hidden\\", noting that Nungesser had been at the center of three sexual assault complaints as well as a number of fliers posted around campus. Nungesser said he agreed to be interviewed by detectives from the NYPD‚Äòs Sex Victims Division in August, but that shortly after this the district attorney's office told him they would not be pursuing the case. Sulkowicz declined to pursue an investigation after discovering the case could extend past graduation, when they would probably want to \\"erase all of [their] memories of Columbia\\". Sulkowicz further stated that NYPD officers were dismissive and \\"badly mistreated\\" them. Sulkowicz's performance art piece Sulkowicz (center right) carrying the mattress at graduation Sulkowicz created Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight) in the summer of 2014 for their senior thesis while at Yale University Summer School of Art and Music. Their first effort was a video of themself dismantling a bed, accompanied by the audio of them filing the police report, which they had recorded on their cellphone.Smith 2014, c. 38:45 mins. The mattress later became the sole focus of the piece. Sulkowicz told New York magazine: The , dark-blue, extra-long twin mattress used in the performance art piece is of the kind Columbia places in its dorms, similar to the one on which they allege they were raped. Sulkowicz spent the summer of 2014 creating the rules of engagement: Written on the walls of their studio in the university's Watson Hall, these state that they must carry the mattress whenever they are on university property; that it must remain on campus even when Sulkowicz is not there; and that they are not allowed to ask for help in carrying it, but if help is offered they may accept it.Smith, December 17, 2014, from c. 39:57 mins; for Watson Hall, Sulkowicz, September 2, 2014, from c. 2:00 mins. In September that year they began carrying it on campus, which they say is a physically painful experience.Duan, Noel (September 9, 2014). \\"Going From Class to Class With Emma Sulkowicz and Her Mattress\\", Elle.com; accessed May 29, 2016. Sulkowicz later created another piece of performance art, Ceci N'est Pas Un Viol (\\"This is not a rape\\"), a website with an eight minute video of Sulkowicz having sex with an anonymous actor in a dorm room at Columbia University.Lux Alptraum, \\"There Is Life After Campus Infamy\\", in The New York Times, July 21, 2018 Nungesser's lawsuit On April 23, 2015, Nungesser filed a sexual discrimination lawsuit against Columbia, its board of trustees, its president Lee Bollinger, and Sulkowicz's supervising art professor Jon Kessler. The suit alleged that the performance was bullying and constituted gender-based harassment, and argued that Columbia's offering course credit for the work violated his rights under Title IX. The suit sought damages for the harm Nungesser said he experienced to his reputation as a result of the performance.Student Accused Being 'Serial Rapist' Files Lawsuit Against Columbia And Art Professor, Associated Press/Huffington Post The suit also faulted Columbia University for sponsoring a project that accused him of rape, despite finding him \\"not responsible\\" for the allegation after an inquiry.Irin Carmon (April 24, 2015), Columbia student accused of rape sues university, msnbc. The suit alleged gender based discrimination, arguing that Nungesser was \\"targeted because he is a male, and attacked for his (consensual) sexual activity.\\" Nungesser's suit also alleged that the publicity surrounding the case had harmed his job prospects. Sulkowicz responded to the lawsuit by saying it is \\"ridiculous that Paul would sue not only the school but one of my past professors for allowing me to make an art piece\\" and saying that Nungesser has made \\"continued public attempts to smear my reputation\\". The school, via one of its spokespeople, had no official comment on the lawsuit, and Kessler also declined to comment,Emanuella Grinberg, Columbia student accused of rape sues over accuser's performance art. CNN, April 28, 2015. although Columbia University president Bollinger offered a general statement: \\"The law and principles of academic freedom allow students to express themselves on issues of public debate; at the same time, our legal and ethical responsibility is to be fair and impartial in protecting the rights and accommodating the concerns of all students in these matters.\\" =Outcome= The case was assigned to US District Court Judge Gregory Woods. Woods dismissed the case in March 2016, but allowed Nungesser another attempt. Nungesser issued an amended complaint in April 2016. The amended complaint argued that Columbia University's sexual assault policies promoted a stereotype of the \\"sex-driven male\\", and constituted gender based discrimination in violation of Title IX. On March 24, 2017 Woods dismissed Nungesser's re-filed complaint, ruling that Nungesser had failed to state an actionable claim against Columbia University. Nungesser's attorney began the process of appealing the dismissal, but on July 14, 2017, Columbia and Nungesser agreed to settle the lawsuit. The university said in a statement that Nungesser was cleared ‚Äúafter a diligent and thorough investigation. Columbia University stands by that finding.‚Äù They continued, ‚ÄúColumbia recognizes that after the conclusion of the investigation, Paul‚Äôs remaining time at Columbia became very difficult for him and not what Columbia would want any of its students to experience. Columbia will continue to review and update its policies toward ensuring that every student ‚Äî accuser and accused, including those like Paul who are found not responsible ‚Äî is treated respectfully and as a full member of the Columbia community.‚Äù The terms of the settlement were confidential. =Commentary on lawsuit= Robby Soave, an editor for Reason.com, commented that Nungesser was \\"flipping the script\\" by basing his suit on Title IX, because \\"many alleged victims of rape who believe that they were deprived of justice have turned to Title IX when they assert that their universities are failing to honor federal requirements.\\"Soave, Robby (April 30, 2015), Mattress Girl Lawsuit: Can Paul Nungesser Beat Columbia in Court? Experts Weigh In - \\"His time at college and future have been shattered\\", Reason. Some commentators expressed skepticism that Nungesser's claim would succeed in court. Megan McArdle commented on the Title IX complaint in Bloomberg View saying, \\"I don't find (Nungesser's) litany of complaints particularly compelling\\", and stated that she believed the gender discrimination claim was unlikely to succeed. McArdle concluded by suggesting that Nungesser may not have intended to win the suit or to silence Sulkowicz, but instead to \\"force the media to pay a little attention to his side of the story, something that didn't happen during the many long months of Sulkowicz's campaign to name and shame him.\\"Megan McArdle: Accused Gets His Say in Columbia Rape Case, Bloomberg View, April 27, 2015. Slate columnist Nora Caplan-Bricker questioned whether the suit could succeed, noting that courts have previously dismissed similar suits in which men accused of sexual assault claimed that they were victims of gender discrimination. Cathy Young, commenting on the dismissal of Nungesser's suit in the New York Post, conceded that \\"Nungesser's case is more of an uphill battle than most\\", but nevertheless argued that she hoped \\"the lawsuit goes forward ‚Äî not only on Nungesser‚Äôs behalf, but for the sake of truth-seeking about a tangled case that raises important issues.\\" Amanda Marcotte, in a column for the news site Talking Points Memo, criticized Nungesser's decision to pursue a claim under Title IX rather than file a libel suit, and characterized the suit as a \\"nuisance lawsuit\\" This characterization was disputed by Samantha Harris of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, who instead argued that the suit demonstrated the problem with requiring universities to investigate accusations of sexual assault, cautioning that \\"until something changes, we are likely to see more cases like this one.\\" Reception Public opinion regarding the case and lawsuit has been mixed. Cathy Young, who has written other \\"stories critical of campus anti-rape activism,\\" criticized Columbia University for violating the defendant's rights to due process, commenting there was \\"certainly enough evidence to grant Nungesser the benefit of reasonable doubt not only in legal disciplinary proceedings, but in the court of public opinion\\". KC Johnson, history professor at Brooklyn College argued that Sulkowicz's performance violated Columbia University's policy instructing participants in campus hearings to ‚Äúmake all reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality/privacy of the involved parties\\". After Sulkowicz accused Cathy Young and Paul Nungesser of invading their privacy while reporting on the accusation, National Review columnist Ian Tuttle wrote Sulkowicz wanted \\"to make claims about another person that cannot be challenged, checked, questioned, or doubted.\\" Columnist and political analyst Mona Charen was critical of Sulkowicz, and said that \\"it seem[ed] highly likely that Sulkowicz is shading the truth\\". Janet Halley, a professor at Harvard Law School, commented that Columbia University's promise to review its policies was \\"a confession\\" that it thinks it made a mistake in how it dealt with the case. Erin Gloria Ryan of Jezebel supported Sulkowicz, criticizing Young and accusing her of invoking a \\"perfect victim\\" narrative that relied on inaccurate stereotypes about how sexual assault victims should behave. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand invited Sulkowicz to a State of the Union address in an effort to \\"further amplify\\" their voice, saying that activists like them \\"shine a light on the scourge of sexual assault\\" on college campuses. When the lawsuit was settled, Dana Bolger, co-founder of Know Your IX, expressed concern, saying she hoped universities wouldn't take the result \\"as a sign that they should be cracking down on student activism\\".

History The cathedral was originally a church practising Orthodox rites prior to the year 1000. In 1228-1229, the present Romanesque church was erected by Frederick II of Swabia. The earthquake of 1456, strongly felt in Brindisi, damaged it. During 1469-1495 it was again rebuilt in a Gothic style. The fa√ßade acquired its elegant rose window in the 15th century. The church once had four such windows. One of the portals is dedicated to Saint Blaise (San Biagio), one of the patrons of the city, and has the saint carved on the portal. A restoration in the 1970s tried to remove stucco decorations that covered the original Romanesque and Gothic architecture. The interior has a number of artworks that covered the ceiling and altars. The Chapel of the Sacred Heart, once of St Cajetan (Gaetano) had a canvas of the saint attributed to Domenico Antonio Vaccaro. The Cappellone dell'Immacolata was decorated in the 18th century. The sacristy has a large venerated icon depicting Saint Oronzo. One Chapel is dedicated to the patron saints of Ostuni: Saint Blaise, Saint Augustine, Saint Orontius, and Saint Irene. The church once had a canvas, now stolen, of Santa Lucia by Palma il Giovane. The apse has an altarpiece of the Assunta, and the chapel of Santa Maria della Sanit√† has a fresco depicting Saint Catherine of Alexandria.

This is done by incorporating a cognitive ecological perspective to cross- cultural god concepts. Religious beliefs are thought to be a byproduct of domain-specific cognitive modules that give rise to religious cognition. The cognitive biases leading to religious belief are constraints on perceptions of the environment, which is part and parcel of a cognitive ecological approach. This means that they not only shape religious beliefs, but they are determinants of how successfully cultural beliefs are transmitted. Furthermore, cognition and behavior are inextricably linked, so the consequences of cultural concepts are associated with behavioral outcomes (i.e., continued interactions with the environment). For religion, behaviors often take the form of rituals and are similarly executed as a consequence of beliefs. Because the religious beliefs distributed in a population are relevant to their behavioral strategies and fine-tuned by natural selection, cross-cultural representations of gods and their characteristics are hypothesized to address ecologically relevant challenges. In other words, religious beliefs are thought to frequently involve solutions, insofar as evolved cognitive equipment can build them, to social and natural environmental problems faced by a given population.  Religious cognition  Research in evolutionary psychology suggests that the brain is a coordinated network of domain-specific modules corresponding to various adaptations that emerged in our evolutionary history. Most claim that a capacity for religious thoughts is not a modular adaptation itself, but an evolutionary byproduct of multiple integrated mechanisms that arose independently and are designed for different functions. These modules are co-opted to give rise to religious thinking patterns, and they include theory of mind, essential psychology and the hyperactive agency detection device. Moreover, the cultural transmission of these ideas is contingent upon them being minimally counterintuitive. = Theory of mind = Theory of mind (ToM) is a capacity to attribute mental states, complete with thoughts, emotions and motivations, to other social agents. This adaptation is ubiquitous in primitive forms among various social species, but the complexity of human social life for long stretches of evolutionary history has facilitated a rich understanding of others' mental experiences to match. Cases of autism have been cited in support for the proposition that ToM is a distinct modular adaptation because of its distinctly narrow impact on ToM capacity. ToM is thought to lend itself to an intuitive sense of mind-body dualism, where the material body is animated by a non-material self (i.e., a \\"soul\\"). = Essentialism = Folk psychology among humans is characterized by essential thinking, or a tendency to interpret objects in terms of \\"essences.\\" This means that attributions of objects' underlying realities are intuitively inferred from a fuzzy set of the object's ontological features. Cognitive interpretations of essence give rise to concepts of purity, simplified good and evil concepts, and intuitive senses of meaning applied to teleology. = Hyperactive agency detection device = The capacity for agent detection has been an important modular adaptation for predator avoidance in humans. Some have called this mechanism a hyperactive agency detection device because of its fairly high rate of erroneous agency applications. In a potential predator situation, humans are forced to interpret an object's ontological features, infer agency or non-agency, and execute a behavioral response. Evolutionary theorists have cited the relatively low costs of incorrect agency inferences and the severe fitness costs of detection failure as a reason to suspect that a tendency to interpret naturalistic processes as agent behaviors is an adaptation. This creates a cognitive bias that leads humans to reason about objects and processes in agentive terms. This is particularly foundational to beliefs in a god or gods. = Minimally counterintuitive beliefs = The integration of ToM, hyperactive applications of agency and essential psychology ultimately renders a cognitive tendency for humans to interact with the naturalistic processes of the world with the intentional stance. This is a perspective from which humans reason that objects and processes may be enacting behaviors intentionally, with meaningful, rational mental states of their own. Religious beliefs are successfully transmitted if they are compatible with the cognitive tools that reconstruct them upon reception. This means that they must be minimally counterintuitive, or that they violate few enough ontological features of an object or process, to make general sense while remaining memorable violations nonetheless. For example, the concept of a ghost exploits existing intuitions about mind-body dualism and only violates the usual coupling of mind and body. This creates a memorable concept of a non-material person that can move through walls and have motives of its own. On the other hand, a highly counterintuitive idea about an object that violates several of its ontological features, like a jealous Frisbee, is less likely to be culturally transmitted. This is because it is cognitively demanding, not easily reconstructed by the brain and thus, not easily reasoned about and remembered. Religious behaviors associated with culturally transmitted god concepts can be conceptualized as phenotypic strategies associated with the informational makeup of that cultural concept. Successfully transmitted religious concepts typically involve minimally counterintuitive violations of the intentional stance, which serves a cognitive constraint of cultural evolution. However, ecological factors also play a role in determining which religious behaviors (and their god concepts) are more likely to be replicated. This means that religious rituals associated with salient representational models of gods' minds and concerns are more likely to survive when they are adaptive strategies.  Ecology of god concepts  Cross-culturally, representational models of gods' minds take an array of diverse forms, such as anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures, abstract forces, or some combination of these. Models of gods' minds typically fall within a spectrum between two extremes: on one end there are Big Gods, and on the other there are Local Gods. Big Gods are usually moralistic, punitive and omniscient, whereas Local Gods are often concerned about ritual behaviors, amoral and limited in knowledge. The subject matter that gods are believed to care across cultures fall into three categories, but may involve an admixture of more than one. These categories are (1) behaviors toward other people, (2) behaviors toward the gods themselves and (3) behaviors toward nature and/or the environment. While people impute these concerns to gods' minds, they often correspond to ecological challenges. This correspondence establishes why religious ideas often covary with ecological problems in the social and natural world: because these ideas enact behavioral strategies that solve them. = Large-scale cooperation = Cases of large- scale cooperation in complex societies are a widely studied example of a socioecological problem that religious beliefs address. Existing models of human cooperation have included kin selection, reciprocal altruism, indirect reciprocity and competitive helping. These models are robust across certain conditions likely relevant to the Pleistocene, but cooperation is easily eroded in large-scale, complex societies with frequently anonymous interactions between strangers. This is because profitable defections dominate cooperative strategies due to a lack of significant threats of punishment to defectors. For large-scale cooperation to succeed, a cultural coordination solution stabilized by sanction threats must exist. Religious rules addressing moral behavior are cultural coordination devices that can expand the scale of cooperative behavior by motivating prosociality. The most important stipulation here is that these devices must be enforced by punishment threats for people who do not behave prosocially. Frequent instances of anonymity in large-scale societies and the costs associated with punishment undermine sanction threats, but widespread beliefs in morally punitive and omniscient gods effectively outsource the punishment costs to a pervasive social monitor. This can effectively motivate widespread prosocial behavior in large-scale, complex societies. This has been empirically supported from a few different angles. For instance, the cross-cultural prevalence of omniscient, moralistic gods (i.e., Big Gods) is positively correlated with society size and complexity. Examples of sharing behaviors in experimental economic games played by large-scale societies also reveal more generous behaviors when individuals are primed with Big God concepts before the game. These shifts toward prosociality are not replicated when similar experiments are applied to small-scale societies. Another recent cross-cultural study compiled experimental economic game data from multiple large- and small-scale societies around the world, where people with various religious beliefs played with local or distant people who were often of the same religion. When distant strangers of the same religion were paired in a game, their sharing behaviors were significantly more generous if their common beliefs involved Big God concepts. The researchers of this study argue that this supports the hypothesis stating that widespread beliefs in omniscient, morally punitive Big Gods may have contributed to the expansion of prosocial behavior. = Costly signaling = Concerns attributed to gods about how people behave toward the gods themselves are widespread and not easily disentangled from specific ecological conditions. The reason is intuitive; rational agents who do not care about their treatment are counterintuitive. Researchers investigating the socioecological functions of ritual behaviors in deference to gods claim that functionally, these rituals serve as costly signals of commitment to the group. Costly ritual displays are particularly public and ubiquitous in small- scale societies, functioning as social devices that promote intragroup cohesion. Reputations related to trustworthiness can be significantly based on adherence to ritual behavior expectations, and fulfillment of these expectations are often a joint function of other behavioral strategies relevant to separate domains of gods' concerns. More broadly, religious costly signals are an implicit expression of honest commitment to the rest of the group, indicating that the signaler is a dedicated part of other aspect of the group's coordinated solution strategies. In small- and large-scale societies alike, these rituals often coexist with other categories of gods' concerns. = Resource management = Resource management and the prevention of material insecurity are more commonly associated with gods' concerns among small-scale societies. While other aspects of religious belief often address social interactions, problems of resource acquisition and security extend from attributed gods' concerns about peoples' interactions with their natural environment. An example of this effect has been alluded to by anthropologist Marvin Harris, who wrote about the economic reasons that Hindu beliefs, holding cows as sacred and forbidden from slaughter, were adaptive. According to Harris, the long-standing and stable benefits derived from many Hindu peoples' use of cows for labor and sources of fuel and fertilizer seemed to outweigh the costs of not eating them. Another ethnographic example of an adaptive use of animal resources was described by Roy Rappaport in 1984, who considered the reasons for ritual pig sacrifice in Papua New Guinea during times of intergroup conflict. These pigs were consuming local peoples' resources and creating resource insecurities that put a strain on the local groups, escalating the intergroup competition for resources and fueling their conflict. Thus, the ritualistic sacrifices alleviated the strain on local resources and mitigated the hostilities between groups. Furthermore, human behavioral ecology researchers have more recently studied burning practices among the Australian Martu people and the consequential increases in local biodiversity. These authors, in an ethnographic discussion of the Martu people, note that these burning practices stem from religious beliefs that their practices allow the world to continue existing as they know it. Another ethnographic example of religious beliefs facilitating resource management comes from the Tyva people, a pastoralist population in southern Siberia. They associate ritual structures called cairns with local spirit masters (cher eezi). These structures demarcate local territories in which spirit masters reside, and the expectation to stop and give prayer offerings out of respect to cher eezi is embedded in peoples' beliefs about them. The cher eezi are believed to be amoral and care mostly about activity within their sacred territories, such as hunting and overexploiting resources that belong to them. More recently, Tyva people have begun facing new challenges associated with urbanization (e.g., pollution, alcohol abuse), and the cher eezi have been more frequently believed to be concerned about these same problems.

The company began selling Kylie Lip Kits, a liquid lipstick and lip liner set on November 30, 2015. Formerly known as Kylie Lip Kits, the company was renamed Kylie Cosmetics. In 2018, Forbes reported the company was valued at $800 million, and in March 2019, valued the company at $900 million. Coty, Inc. bought a 51% controlling stake in the company for $600 million in November 2019. However, in early 2020 Forbes reported - citing documentation from the Coty deal - that Kylie Cosmetics had overvalued itself. Background In 2014, Kylie Jenner and her mother Kris Jenner founded the company and partnered with Seed Beauty, a retail and product development company co-founded by siblings, John and Laura Nelson. The company's first product Kylie Lip Kits, a liquid lipstick and lip liner, debuted on November 30, 2015. The first 15,000 lip kits were produced by Seed Beauty and funded by Jenner at a cost of $250,000 from her modelling earnings. The company was renamed to Kylie Cosmetics in February 2016 and production was increased to 500,000 kits. By the end of 2016, the company's total revenue was over $300 million. Jenner has described her decision to use her former insecurity about her lip size as inspiration for her brand, saying it's \\"one of the most authentic things I've done in my career\\".  Business  =Collaborations and collections= Jenner has collaborated with several other celebrities on collections for Kylie Cosmetics. Some notable collaborations include Kim Kardashian West, Khloe Kardashian, and Kourtney Kardashian. Most recently, Jenner has collaborated with her mother, Kris Jenner. In November 2016, Kylie announced the very first Kylie Cosmetics collaboration called Koko X Kylie, where she teamed up with her half-sister, Khloe Kardashian. In April 2017, Jenner announced her collaboration with her half-sister, Kim Kardashian-West, called KKW X Kylie. Kylie Cosmetics partnered with Kim Kardashian-West soon after the KKW release. In May 2017, it was announced Koko X Kylie would be returning for a Part 2 of the half-sisters‚Äô collaboration. In a month long pop-up event in November 2017, seven TopShop stores across the US sold Kylie Cosmetics products. In November 2018, Kylie Cosmetics began selling their products at Ulta. Many attribute the brand's success to Jenner's cosmetically altered lips. In April 2018, Jenner announced her Kylie Cosmetics collaboration with her oldest half-sister, Kourtney Kardashian, called Kourt X Kylie. On May 9, 2018, Kylie and Kris Jenner announced their collaboration called the Kris Kollection via Kylie's personal Instagram. The Mini Lip Set in the Kris Kollection, which includes eight mini liquid lipsticks, is aptly named ‚ÄúMomager‚Äù, a title in which Kris Jenner has personally taken on, and attempted to trademark, in recent years. In addition to the \\"Momager\\" Lip Kit, the Kris Kollection includes lip glosses and a four pan pressed powder highlight/blush palette, which has created a lot of controversy online with both good and bad reviews. The collection was released just in time for Mother's Day. On September 14, 2018, Kylie announced her new launch the Jordyn X Kylie collection, in celebration of her long term friendship Jordyn Woods.. Kylie was said to have removed products from this collection after the fallout of their friendship from the Tristan and Jordyn scandal. On June 9, 2019, Kylie announced her collaboration with her half sister Khlo√© Kardashian for the third time. In 2019, Kylie announced her collaboration with Oliver Rousteing the creative director for Balmain in the KylieXBalmain collection. Which launched on September 27 of that year. On June 26, 2020, Kylie Cosmetics released a collection called ‚ÄúKendall By Kylie Cosmetics‚Äù. It was created by Kylie Jenner and her sister Kendall Jenner. It sold out within 24 hours. Kendall is the last Kardashian-Jenner sister to collaborate with Kylie. Non-collaborative collections In February 2018, Jenner released Kylie Cosmetics‚Äô first non-collaborative collection: Weather. Jenner explained the collection is an ode to her daughter, Stormi, who inspired the collection and was born earlier that month. In August 2019, Jenner released her Birthday Collection. This collection was for her 22nd birthday and included lip kits, an eyeshadow pallet, a face primer, matte lipsticks, jelly kylighters, an eyeliner, and many more products. This collection featured money themed packaging. Jenner took a portion of her earnings from her birthday collection and collaborated with Ellen DeGeneres to give away over $1 million. $750,000 went to a group of women in Florida who have a non-profit organization called Nest Of Love. In February 2020 Kylie launch the Stormi collection, in celebration of her daughters second birthday. This launch included beauty products such as eyeshadow palettes, Kylie lip kits, and blush. The launch was a success and the products quickly sold out. = Pop-up locations = Kylie is known for making appearances at pop-up shops which are located inside Topshops where she does meet and greets with fans. She's had seven locations all around the country where she has sold Lip Kits as well as pallets. The locations are in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; New York; Las Vegas, Nevada; Houston, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Miami, Florida =Partnerships= In December 2015, Jenner's mother, Kris Jenner, partnered the company with Canadian e-commerce platform Shopify to outsource sales. =Packaging= The 2016 redesign of the Kylie Lip Kit packagingIn May 2016, Kylie Cosmetics changed the packaging of its Lip Kits due to complaints of theft. Due to the easily recognizable packaging and high demand for the product at the time, some customers received empty boxes after having their products stolen in the mailing process. The original Kylie Lip Kit box was black with a white lip gloss drip design. In order to solve the theft issue, the boxes were changed to a basic black, and the recognizable lip gloss design was moved to the inside of the box. In the April 2018 release of the Kourt X Kylie Collection, Kylie Cosmetics included eyeshadow palettes with brand new plastic packaging rather than the traditional cardboard packaging. =Marketing= Kylie Cosmetics heavily depends on social media for its marketing. As of August 2018, Jenner has the most followed Snapchat account and 164 million Instagram followers, all of whom see her teases to past and future makeup releases. Kylie Cosmetics also advertises daily on Instagram with verified the account @Kyliecosmetics. The Instagram account currently has 21.9 million followers. They share popular beauty influences reviews, sales, new products, and many photos of Kylie Jenner herself using the products. In November 2019, @kyliecosmetics on Instagram hit 22.4 million followers. While Jenner, or members of her family, often serve as the face of Kylie Cosmetics, the pair of lips that advertise the Lip Kits themselves belongs to beauty and lifestyle blogger, Ashley Rosales. Before entering the beauty community, Ashley Rosales served in the United States Army as a mechanic. Kylie relies heavily on YouTube for marketing her launches. Kylie Jenner's YouTube channel has over 7.5 million subscribers. She'll often record 'get ready with me' to promote her upcoming launches. Jenner revealed that she has enlisted her housekeeper and her boyfriend Travis Scott to model swatches of the makeup on their arms for social media advertisements. Criticism =\\"Luxury\\" brush scandal= In an occurrence dubbed by Cosmopolitan Australia as the \\"Kylie makeup brush scandal of 2017\\", Jenner received backlash from fans, makeup gurus, and Internet users alike after Kylie Cosmetics launched a set of 16 luxury makeup brushes, priced at $360. After a few big-name makeup artists including James Charles and Jeffree Star weighed in with their negative opinions on the price of the brush kit, Jenner responded via her personal Twitter, telling fans, \\"I hear you guys\\". All 30 shades of Kylie Cosmetics' controversial concealer line =Skin Concealer controversy= After the release of the concealer line, Skin Concealer, Kylie Cosmetics received negative feedback from Internet users who claimed the company was copying Rihanna‚Äôs makeup line, Fenty Beauty. Though the intention of the makeup line was to remain inclusive, it was assumed by some that Jenner was profiting from diversity by including 30 shades in her concealer line. It was also observed that all of the darker shades had red undertones, as explicitly described on the Kylie Cosmetics website, prompting the criticism that it did not cater to all skin types. =\\"Provocative\\" blushes= The release of Kylie Cosmetics‚Äô March 2018 line of blushes sparked anger among some fans who thought that the names of some of the new products, such as \\"Barely Legal\\", \\"Virginity\\", \\"X Rated\\", and \\"Hot and Bothered\\", were too provocative, especially for the Jenner's younger fans. = Company overvaluation = On April 8, 2020, Forbes again named Jenner as the world's youngest \\"self made\\" billionaire, citing her net worth having increased to 1.2 billion dollars. However, in May Forbes released a statement accusing Jenner of forging tax documents so she would appear as a billionaire. The publication also accused her of fabricating revenue figures for Kylie Cosmetics, citing documents Coty Inc (which had acquired a majority stake in Kylie Cosmetics) had released. The Forbes article concluded that Kylie Cosmetics was significantly smaller and less profitable than previously reported.

Prison programming and how it is structured has changed significantly over the decades to fit the needs of women in gender-specific programming. Focus on gender-specific programming increased during the 1970s and 1980s, an era marked by a substantial increase in the female prison population. Traditional programming in female correctional facilities have been deemed ineffective since most were structured to fit men's needs. For example, women's pathways to prison typically involve drugs, while men are typically involved in violent crimes. Additionally, women are more likely to have experiences of sexual and/or physical abuse relative to men.  History of programming in women's prisons  = Before 1980 = Programming for imprisoned women was centered on domesticity, although efforts were made to include industrial training programs and academic programs. For example, the Indiana Women's Prison tried to incorporate chair caning, paper-boxing making, glove stitching, and laundry, which, with the exception of the latter, were deemed \\"financially disappointing.\\" Academic classes were difficult to maintain due to staff and funding shortages, and differences in education levels among the women. At another institution in Framingham, Massachusetts, administrators implemented an indenture system, a conditional early release program that allowed women to serve as domestic servants in nearby homes located on the country side, which proved to be rather successful with a less than nine percent recidivism rate for those who participated in the program. Domesticity was also promoted by prisoner officials. For example, in 1896, former superintendent Sarah Keely described the work offered to women as being appropriate, since it reflected work in a familial setting. The lucrative nature and accessibility of acquiring domestic skills contributed to their lack of participation in higher skills training. Despite efforts to equip female inmates with remunerative skills, programming throughout the early and mid-1900s continued to consist of limited educational and vocational opportunities. Job training programming mostly entailed training in as cleaning, sewing, cosmetology, food service, laundry, and clerical work, programs that did not lead women to meaningful and financially secure job opportunities upon release. It has been noted that use of such programs persisted since most women entered prison with little to no education or work experience. Prior to the 1980s, there was a lack of programming focused on drug treatment for incarcerated women, and even less research regarding the outcomes of treatment programs in general. Research regarding the relationship between women and substance abuse had begun only a few years earlier during the 1970s, and focused primarily on alcohol treatment services, rather than drug treatment services. Furthermore, since the female prison population was relatively small, male substance abuse treatment had set the standard. Two of the earliest research studies investigated the outcomes of Cornerstone program (Oregon, 1976), and the Stay'n Out program (New York, 1974), with the latter conducted at an all-female facility. While these programs were found to be successful, it was noted that other male-oriented programming such as urine testing and drug education courses were generally ineffective for female offenders. Only during the 1980s and 1990s did research regarding gender-specific programming for women become more prevalent. = 1980s to late 1990s = During the 1980s and the early 1990s, researchers began investigating how substance abuse affected women and men differently, and how women functioned in traditional treatment programs. Researchers found that the characteristics of female substance abuse differed from male substance abuse in several ways including pathways to drug use, psychosocial factors, and psychological impacts of drug use. One study conducted in California prisons found that nearly 80% of women reported some form of physical and/or sexual abuse followed by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Furthermore, it was observed that in traditional drug and alcohol programs such as Alcohol Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA), women had lower participation rates in all aspects including entry, retention, and completion compared to those of their male counterparts. The emphasis on gender-specific programming was further substantiated by the fact that a greater proportion of women than men were serving sentences for drug-related offenses during this period of time. In highlighting the relationship between women's drug use to other issues such as poverty, abuse, race and gender inequalities, studies acknowledged the ineffectiveness of isolated, treatment options. As a result of this research, several designs for an effective gender-specific program were identified. Some of most common characteristics included female-only environments, promotion of female empowerment, skill building, mutual exchange, and relational orientation. One major effort designed to achieve gender-specific substance abuse treatment include the implementation and monitoring of therapeutic communities (TCs), which are characterized by the National Institute for Drug Abuse as \\"drug-free residential settings that use a hierarchical model with treatment stages that reflect increased levels of personal and social responsibility\\". TCs have been a national model for drug abuse treatment historically found in male facilities, but have appeared in female facilities. While male-oriented TCs tend to use authoritarian and aggressive approaches, female-oriented TCs take a more relaxed, and less confrontational approach. In both cases, TCs have been successful in reducing recidivism. For example, the Stay'n Out program was shown to reduce recidivism rates for both women and men. Furthermore, women who stayed in the program for 9 to 12 months were more likely to successfully complete their parole compared to their male counterparts. For women suffering from severe and long-term abuse, a more intense TC, residential TC, was implemented. Women in these residential programs lived together, and away from the general prison population. Despite this being most needed form of treatment for women, in 1994, most prisons lacked this type residential programming, with less than nine percent of women receiving such treatment while incarcerated. In addition to TC programs being successful, they tend to be less expensive than the cost of incarceration. In 1993, the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, an initiative developed under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), began funding mid-term and long-term residential TC programs for incarcerated women. These programs tend to last anywhere from fifty days to six months. In addition, they began funding one residential program, and two intensive intervention programs which lasted at least six months, and on average two weeks, respectively. One TC program was roughly $790,000 for 250 women, or approximately $3,200 per inmate, while the cost of incarceration ranged from $20,000 and $30,000, supporting the idea that incarceration is more expensive than treatment. In the case of CSAT-sponsored programs, the average cost of incarceration was roughly $51, while the cost of treatment was $9.22 per woman. In the early 1990s, post-secondary educational programs were solely academic in nature, and in women's prisons, were either nonexistent, or underutilized, with less than 10 percent of female prison population enrolled in educational programming. In 1994, this number further decreased due to inmates' ineligibility for the Pell grant and other financial aid. Funding for educational programming included federal grants, private donors, as well as state financial aid, as seen in North Carolina and California.  Substance abuse programming  Traditionally, the most common treatment for substance abuse stems from a medical model, which views addiction disease. This model sees disease of addiction as being rooted solely in the individual. Relatively recent research suggests that addiction can be best understood holistically, as evident in the more recent programming that focus on other aspects of the individual. Currently, most female correctional facilities contain a range of evidence-based programming for substance abuse that have been shown to both reduce recidivism, and promote positive social behavior. Most of the substance abuse programs are largely funded by organizations such as CSAT. In addition to residential TCs, prison-based substance abuse programming may include detoxification units, inpatient drug treatment, outpatient treatment or counseling, self-help group/peer counseling, education/awareness, or maintenance program. Volunteering professionals across several disciplines often run these programs, since effective gender-responsive programming should address substance abuse holistically. While there has been an increase in the number of substance abuse treatment options, research regarding their effectiveness has reduced since the late 1990s. The outcome evaluations that come during the early 2000s focus primarily on programming elements that contribute to high levels of effectiveness. For example, a 2001 study of treatment investigated the effectiveness of receiving treatment (versus not receiving treatment), group type (mixed versus female only), and the type of women's treatment (enhanced vs standard).  Professional development/employment  = Vocational training = Vocational training covers a wide range of occupations including trade skills such as auto mechanics, and electrical work or other occupational skills such as culinary arts, warehousing, and other hands-on work experience. Nonetheless, there tends to be far less vocational training programs in women's facilities compared to male facilities, even though women are more likely to take advantage of such programs. Vocational training programs currently provided in female correctional facilities are much like those seen throughout the 1980s and 1990s. They are gender-stereotyped and lower-skill opportunities such as sewing, clerical work, food services, and cosmetology. The use of these types of vocational programs has been described as ironic since some state legislatures prohibit ex-offenders from entering such fields. In 2003, at least six states had barred ex-offenders from public employment, prohibiting them opportunities in approximately 350 higher-skilled occupations, thus restricting women to low-paying jobs upon reentry. By far, vocational training and work assignments have ranked highest among women's priorities. Due to limitations and high demands of these programs, enrollment is quite difficult. In some cases, the waitlists tend to be longer than the number of students. In one survey conducted in 1995, vocational was identified as a top priority, but only 14 to 28 percent of women were actually enrolled. Furthermore, the educational eligibility requirements for vocational training tend to result in underutilization of programs since some require higher levels of education. For example, a business program at a New Hampshire women's facility in the 1990s was inaccessible since most women lacked the educational requirements. Additionally, access to stable employment is often compounded by the fact that newly released women have limited access to adequate transportation and resources, which reduces the likelihood of long-term employment. The existence of vocational program is not enough to recidivism; the quality of the program, and the need for that occupation must also be taken into account. More specifically, the program must train women in widely available fields experiencing shortages, and must in an area that will provide a living wage. For example, a temporary plumbing maintenance program was implemented throughout correctional facilities in New York State during the early 2000s, a time where plumbers were of relatively high demand. One of the strongest indicators of stable employment is education. Studies of women in state correctional facilities reveal a positive relationship between educational level and probability of employment. Furthermore, higher education has been shown to increase self-esteem. The high regard for post-secondary is not reflected in prison programming. Over 90 percent of state prisons provide educational programs that focus on GED preparation and adult basic education, but only a few prisons offer programming in post-secondary education. Furthermore, participation in educational programs is relatively lower than participation in vocational training, and work assignments. The challenge to complete coursework appears specifically when competing with participation in paid work assignments. In a comparative study of women's participation in programming, less than half, 34 percent of women participated in educational programming, while 70 percent of women had work assignments. = Postsecondary education = College education is becoming increasingly important for advancement in the labor market. Consequently, more focus is being placed on higher education in correctional facilities. Some prisons have developed relationships with local community colleges to form postsecondary correctional education (PSCE) programs. Such programs allow individuals to take credited (or non-credited) college level courses. Through funding, these programs are offered at discounted rates, or at no cost to the inmate. The programs vary in length, eligibility requirements, eligibility, course type, and program structure.

Its humble beginnings started as it was home of Jesse Andrew, a vibrant member of the early West Lafayette community. Mr. Andrews is considered to be one of the cities founders as he took a major part in the establishment of the government. The house was originally built in 1859 making it the oldest home and one of the oldest structures in the city. It went through major renovations in the 1930s, turning it into a duplex, before being sold out of the Andrew's family to a local rental company in the 1980s. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs For the last 35 years the house has been called home by many college students, thankful for its historic value and proximity to campus. Current residents are four third year students at Purdue named Matthew Mills, Gregg Ray, and Ben Claywell. When interviewed about his dwelling place, Gregg responded, \\"It's a great place to live and so close to my classes, but I think my favorite part is knowing its history. I mean the building is almost 160 years old! How many great men and women have lived in this place? From [Jesse] Andrews to Will Claywell the home has definitely been apart of shaping the lives of many heroes. It is meaningful to me to be able to walk in the footsteps of these and many other great people.\\"Ray, Gregg \\"Interview with Gregg Ray.\\" Interview by author. May 4, 2016. As the Jesse Andrew Home is protected as a National Historic landmark, Gregg's experience will not end with him; maybe his children, or his children's children will too walk in the footsteps of the legends of old and will take part in the great making of history at the footsteps of the Purdue Memorial Union in Jesse Andrews House.  Significance  \\"The Jesse Andrew House is significant as the oldest home extant in West Lafayette, and as the residence of one of the town's founders. A Greek Revival-style structure, built in 1859, this home remained in the Andrew family until 1982, and is one of few original structures remaining near the Purdue University campus. Jesse Andrew, Sr., the original owner of this house, was considered one of the most influential settlers in the area in the 1850s, One of 43 settlers who originally established the town government in 1866, Jesse Andrew also drew up the town's original plat. Both he and his son, Jesse Charles Andrew, who purchased this home in 1881, were prominent merchants in the community. As West Lafayette expanded, both men were responsible for platting important additions to the city. Subsequent owners of the home included Jesse Charles Andrew's brother, Thomas, and his son, Joseph, both of whom achieved local prominence. Thomas M. Andrew was the organizer and first president of the Purdue State Bank (now Purdue National Bank), and also served as a member of the Indiana State Legislature in 1904. His son, Joseph H. Andrew, who later owned and occupied this structure, was active in the American Red Cross, and served on that organization's National Board of Governors. The current owners purchased the structure from the Andrew family in 1982, and recently completed an extensive renovation.\\"  Appearance and structural details  \\"The Jesse Andrew Home is a two-story Greek Revival structure located on the south side of West Lafayette, near the Purdue University campus. The home is basically an ell-shaped structure with a gable roof; a small, hip-roofed wing, possibly a later addition, projects from the rear facade. Constructed as a single-family residence in 1859, this structure was altered to provide two apartment units sometime in the 1930s. The main (east) facade of the home is a gable end wall three bays in width. On the ground floor level, the two southernmost bays contain two-over-two, double- hung windows with entablature hood molds. The third bay has been modified from the original configuration and now contains two separate entry doors, to provide private access to each of the apartments. A large wooden porch dating from the 1880s protects the ground floor level of this facade; this porch features square columns with molded capitals supporting a flat roof with a wide frieze decorated with dentils and a cyma recta cornice. The porch roof also serves as a deck for the second floor, and features a balustrade with simple square balusters and corner posts. On the second floor, the two exterior bays contain double-hung windows similar to those on the ground floor. The middle bay, located slightly south of center, originally contained a window, but was converted into a doorway in the 1880s to provide access to the porch roof deck. A raking cornice and frieze with returns decorates the gable area, and a triangular attic vent is located just below the gable peak. Window and cornice detailing throughout the rest of the house is similar to that employed on the main facade. The interior of the house was slightly modified when the house was divided into apartments in the 1930s. The walnut balustrade of the main stairway was removed and the stair enclosed with a partition wall in order to provide privacy for the upstairs apartment; the balustrade has been discovered in storage in the attic. The endwall fireplaces were also sealed at this time and remain inoperable. Asbestos shingle siding was applied to the exterior of the home sometime in the 1950s. The present owners, who purchased the home from the Andrew family in 1982, have recently completed a major renovation of the structure. Several termite-damaged structural members were replaced, and other floor joists were braced with concrete block piers. The roof decking was repaired and a new roof installed.

Overview In this book, Plantinga introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability.Alvin Plantinga, Warrant and Proper Function, New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. Plantinga's \\"proper function\\" account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one's \\"belief-forming and belief- maintaining apparatus of powers\\" are functioning properly‚Äî\\"working the way it ought to work\\".WPF, p. 4 Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a \\"design plan\\", as well as an environment in which one's cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: \\"it is perhaps possible that evolution (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans\\",WPF, p. 21 but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological naturalism- i.e. epistemology that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties ‚Äì is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics ‚Äì in this case the belief in a creator God or designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.WPF, 237. According to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if: > (1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning > properly‚Ä¶; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one > for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) ‚Ä¶ the design plan > governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or > function, the production of true beliefs‚Ä¶; and (4) the design plan is a good > one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a > belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan > in that sort of environment is true. Plantinga, Warrant and Proper Function, > 1993. 194. Plantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as \\"naturalistic\\", including the \\"functional generalization\\" view of John Pollock, the evolutionary/etiological account provided by Ruth Millikan, and a dispositional view held by John Bigelow and Robert Pargetter.WPF, p. 199-211.

He fought in the \\"Sowinski\\" Battalion, \\"Waligora\\" Grouping, under his wartime code name Piorun (). Piotrowski took part in the Warsaw Uprising (), the largest single military effort taken by any European resistance movement during World War II and the largest scale World War II operation by the Home Army () to liberate Warsaw from Nazi Germany. The Uprising was timed to coincide with the Soviet Union's Red Army approaching the eastern suburbs of the city and the retreat of German forces. However, the Soviet advance purposefully stopped short, enabling the Germans to regroup and demolish the city while defeating the Polish resistance, which Piotrowski fought in for 63 days with little outside support. After a 63-day fight, Piotrowski was captured and sent to the first of 5 camps he would be imprisoned at; Lamsdorf, a German prisoner of war camp which housed Polish prisoners from the German September 1939 offensive. More than 100,000 prisoners from Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, Greece, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Poland, South Africa, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and the United States passed through this camp.http://www.lamsdorf.com/history.html He was later transferred to another German prisoner-of-war camp, Luckenwalde, located in Brandenburg, 52 kilometers (32 miles) south of Berlin. At its height in May 1944, a total of 48,600 POW's were registered there. Piotrowski was held there until the end of the war. After the war, he studied economics and became a professional economist with Inco-Veritas S.A., a privately-owned Polish chemical products consortium founded in 1947. A devout Christian, Piotrowski refused to join the newly formed communist party of Poland, the Polish United Workers' Party, making life even harder than it was for Poles at the time. As a result of his refusal to join the party, nearly all of the Piotrowski family's land, real estate and bank account holdings were confiscated and never returned by the government, at the time a satellite state of the Soviet Union. On 25 August 1948, Piotrowski married Teodora \\"Tonia\\" Starostka. They had three children, Nina, Wanda and Aleksandra. Wanda died 17 days after being born. After 33 years of marriage, Tonia died on October 13, 1981 at the age of 56 from breast cancer. Among the many orders, decorations and medals of Poland received by Piotrowski, in 2011, he was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta (, ), one of Poland's two highest decorations, awarded only to the most distinguished Poles and the highest-ranking representatives of foreign countries. On June 2, 2016, Piotrowski died of complications from Alzheimer's disease.

It usually appears as a scaly, winged, reptilian beast, but in some cases it could be a mixture of other beings. Early appearances Dragons were part of Hungarian culture prior to the 18th century. According to their oldest, universal function, dragons symbolized the unity of the material and spiritual worlds. They were later associated with natural phenomena. They either made or appeased the violent forces of nature. They brought rainstorms and tornados. The rumble of the thunder was the roaring of dragons battling above the clouds, striking the clouds with their tails with crash in the heat of the fight and, as a consequence, causing floods of rain pouring over the Hungarian fields. Characteristics A S√°rk√°ny with numerous heads Though legends offer scant information about the characteristics of the ancient dragons, in some regions it was an accepted that they were born through a transformational process of another being. In the region of Csall√≥k√∂z, for example, it was thought that dragons were created from an old pike or a 7 or 13-year-old rooster. As the tales tell, when a pike is laying in the mud for several months, it changed into a dragon. In the rooster's case, a dragon is born when the bird hides around the house for too long;. As a dragon, it can be only lured out by the so-called Garabonci√°s, a human with magical qualities, who later uses the beast as a mount. In other regions, the belief was that dragons can be born from other dragon. The female, after being pregnant for seven years, suckles her son for another seven years. Dragons usually appear in two forms: the first is the rideable, tyrant mount of the Garabonci√°s, and the other is the serpent-like creature with several fins, long claws and teeth. Their scales can vary between all the colours of the rainbow, and they are so strong that almost no weapon can hurt their skin. They usually live inside hollow trunks, dens, or in the abandoned caves in the mountains. Dragons in Hungarian literature In earlier tales, dragon had no treasure-hoarding characteristics. Later, they became hoarders of gold and gems. This version of the dragon slithered onto the pages of children's literature of the 19th and early 20th centuries, where they appeared often. they generally appeared as aggressive beasts of prey. In these stories, they are always the villain, whose role is setting the story in motion. They abduct humans, young maidens, especially, and disturb the peaceful village and its inhabitants. The role of the hero is simple: by defeating the creature, he not only save the princess, but gains reputation and prestige. A fight with the S√°rk√°ny Benedek Elek c.1920 Dragons are usually antrophomorphic, aggressive beings, who have human- like characteristics: although they are the villains of the stories, they frequently sing and dance, nor do they say no wine. This image can be found in stories of the most well-known Hungarian authors, such as Elek Benedek, Gyula Illy√©s, or Arnold Ipolyi. In the J√°nos Di√°k, the dragon \\"sniffles with its nose\\", or in the Hajnal (\\"Dawn\\"), it is mentioned that dragons live in \\"Dragonland\\" (S√°rk√°nyorsz√°g), where the hero needs to travel in order to save the kidnapped maiden. In Gyula Illy√©s's storybook, Hetvenh√©t Magyar N√©pmese, the talking and cunning dragons are usually killed by a young, courageous boy, who symbolically steps into adulthood as he kills the beast. In most of these tales, dragons have six, nine, twelve or twenty-four heads, numbers which indicates that importance of numerology in Hungarian folklore. As the 20th century came to a close, another version of dragons has transpired in postmodern Hungarian literature: the image of the violent beast transformed into a wise and emotional being. Ervin L√°z√°r's H√©tfej≈± T√ºnd√©r introduces the readers a tale of a boy, whose sickness can only be cured by killing the seven-headed dragon. When the boy realizes what an outstanding and beautiful being the dragon is, he cannot perform the task. Besides, perhaps the most well-known instance for the image of the new Hungarian dragon is S√ºs√º, created by Istv√°n Csuk√°s, who was a prominent figure in the lives of Hungarian children. Not only is he a sensitive character, but also an exceptional dragon among his own kind as he has only one head, which leads him to his outcast status. Csuk√°s focused on the sensitive, emotional representation of the dragon, where the children effortlessly can identify with the magical beast. From a psychological point of view, the delicate beast in the fairy tales helps the children facing their inner \\"monsters\\", where the dragon offers a solution, or a help for the bigger, scarier problems that the child has to face with in the foreseeable future.

B16 melanoma is a murine tumor cell line used for research as a model for human skin cancers. B16 cells are useful models for the study of metastasis and solid tumor formation, and were one of the first effective murine tools for metastasis research. History B16 cells were discovered and maintained in the Jackson Laboratories in Maine in 1954 when a tumor developed naturally behind the ear of a C57BL/6 mouse. The cells were resected, transplanted, and maintained in vivo, and still are today. B16 models were in use to an extent in the 1970s, but it was Dr. Isaiah J. Fidler, a Jerusalem-born, Oklahoma State-trained veterinarian, and University of Pennsylvania-trained biological researcher, now at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, who established solid protocols for use the B16 model. One of his first major studies involving B16 was in 1970. Dr. Fidler stained B16s, having cultured them in vitro, with 125I-5-iodo-2‚Ä≤-deoxyuridine for tracking, and implanted the cells into C57BL/6J mice, the common host, sacrificed the mice at different times, and measured the cells in the blood and in different organs.Fidler, Isaiah J. 1970. Metastasis, quantitative analysis of distribution and fate of tumor cell emboli labelled with ‚ÇÅ25 1UdR. He ascertained that 99% of the original cell population had perished within a day, and that a cohort of about 400 cells had colonized the lung. The study was seminal because it established the existence of a reliable metastasis pathway that was uncomplicated to perturb and view changes. It also showed that metastasis is not guaranteed simply by the presence of tumor cells. Only a certain few are able to circulate and latch on to the right organ and begin to form a tumor. In the 1980s it was discovered that B16 cells express very low levels of mouse class I major histocompatibility complex glycoproteins, H-2Kb and H-2Db, and that in vitro treatment with gamma interferon simultaneously induced a high expression of H-2 and an increase in the metastatic potential of B16 cells. Characteristics B16 cells originate in melanin-producing epithelia of mice, and are easy to track in vivo post-transplantation. Their fidelity of metastasis from skin to lung, liver, and spleen make them useful and predictable tools to study metastatic pathways.Wosko TJ, DT Ferrara, and LS Sartori. 1984. \\"Histological comparison of the B16 melanoma and its F1 variant\\". Cancer Letters. 24 (1): 57-63.Albert, Daniel M., and Arthur Polans. 2003. Ocular oncology. New York: Marcel Dekker. In the 1962 edition of the Handbook of Genetically Standardized Jax Mice, the cells were described thus: Varying surface proteins were shown to play an important part in the locative destiny of the cells on which they are affixed. The presence of high numbers of particular proteins correspond to a cell's affinity for particular organs was selected for in many of the lines perpetuated in labs in the seventies and eighties. Tumor cells from lungs, for instance, would be harvested from a deceased mouse and transplanted into another mouse's skin, and that mouse, upon death, would have its resultant lung tumors transplanted to the next mouse, and so on. Over time, cells in that line injected into the skin would almost always become lung tumors. The same directed etiology, moreover, has been undertaken for many other organs, leading to separate sub-lines with titles such as B16-F10, B16-BL6, B164A5, B16GMCSF, and B16FLT3. Use in Research Today, B16 melanoma remains indispensable for metastasis studies. Current research projects focus on the cells‚Äô immunological response to vaccines, microRNA mediated metastatic properties, especially miR-21, a noted aggressor of tumor suppressors and anti-proliferative factors.Bosserhoff, Anja-Katrin. 2011. Melanoma development: molecular biology, genetics and clinical application. Wien: Springer. B16 is also used as a pre-clinical model to study immunotherapy. Those are just a few examples, but the undergirding idea is that the B16 melanoma model is a powerful research tool, and a staple for metastasis studies, and its development as such can be considered a huge benefit to the cancer research community.

Construction of the station was originally approved by voters in the 2008 Sound Transit 2 ballot measure, but deferred two years later after a funding shortfall. The Sound Transit 3 ballot measure, passed in 2016, re-instated funding and approval for the station, as well as an extension to Federal Way Transit Center.

The park-and- ride closed on March 22, 2020, to prepare for light rail construction. An alternative option that was not chosen as the preferred route in July 2015 would have placed the station at the intersection of State Route 99 and South 272nd Street, closer to the Redondo neighborhood in Des Moines.

It is a brackish water ray- finned fish found in Australia along mud banks never far from mangrove trees. It is in the goby family Gobiidae. It is named after Charles Darwin because the holotype was collected in Darwin Harbour. Its greatest distinguishing characteristic from other mudskippers is its greatly reduced first dorsal fin in both sexes.  Description  The Darwin's mudskipper has a body shape and dorsally pultruding eyes similar to other mudskippers. They have a maximum length of 4.6 cm. It has 5 ‚Äì 7 dorsal spines, 10 ‚Äì 12 dorsal rays, 1 anal spine, and 11 ‚Äì 13 anal rays. Its greatest distinguishing characteristic from other mudskippers is its greatly reduced first dorsal fin in both sexes. Its coloration is modally with a background color of light brown. They typically have dark brown streaks on their heads. They usually have dark brown saddles and diagonal and irregular bars.  Diet  The Darwin's mudskipper has been seen eating small invertebrates such as small crabs, but there has not been any published studies[2] on this topic.  Habitat  The Darwin's mudskipper is a brackish to freshwater fish. It is found in the intertidal zone, in tidal creeks, and in inlets along mud banks. They are always near mangrove trees. They often group together. They are considered less aggressive than other mudskippers.  Reproduction and life cycle  There is no published study available on the life cycle or reproduction of the Darwin's mudskipper.  Distribution  Darwin's mudskipper can be found in the Northern Territory and Western Australia.  Importance to humans  The Darwin's mudskipper is harmless to humans[1]. There are other mud skippers in the aquarium trade, but the Darwin's mudskipper is not. Etymology The vernacular name and specific name honour Charles Darwin who the type locality, Darwin, Northern Territory was named after.

Biography Born into a Greek-Catholic family in Oradea, Ion Pop, \\"Prezen»õa lui Mircea Zaciu\\", in Tribuna, nr. 143-144, September 2008 his parents were Adrian Zaciu, a lawyer, and his wife Otilia (n√©e Muth), a high school secretary. The family had peasant origins in the Coa»ô area, and was possibly Aromanian at its roots. He attended primary school in Satu Mare from 1935 to 1939, followed by one year at Miahi Eminescu High School in the same city. Following the Second Vienna Award, when the area was ceded to Hungary, the family took refuge in Arad. There, he took years two through six at Moise NicoarƒÉ High School. He attended the final two years and graduated from Emanuil Gojdu High School in Oradea, by then back under Romanian administration. From 1947 to 1951, he attended the Romanian language and literature section of the literature faculty at Cluj University, earning a degree in 1952. Meanwhile, he took up but abandoned the study of law. Beginning in his fourth year, Zaciu worked as an associate instructor at the Romanian literature department, under the supervision of Dumitru Popovici. He rose to teaching assistant (1952), assistant professor (1952-1962), associate professor (1962-1972) and full professor (1972-1990). From 1990, he was consulting professor, abandoning this role in 1997; during this period, he was thesis adviser, having twice previously been denied the position. He served as dean of the Cluj philology faculty from 1962 to 1966, and earned a doctorate in Romanian philology in 1967. From 1967 to 1970, he lectured at the universities of Cologne, Bonn and Aachen, teaching Romanian language and literature. In 1970, his contract was not renewed and he was fired from the position of chairman within the contemporary Romanian literature and literary theory department, a post he had held since 1967. He was received into the Romanian Writers' Union in 1956, forming part of its leadership for three successive terms, and again from 1990 to 1995. Through this organization, he was able to take part in conferences and colloquia in Germany, Italy, Turkey, Iraq, Denmark and Finland. He moved to Germany in 1990, but spent lengthy periods in Romania, and from that time was honorary director of Vatra magazine, based in T√¢rgu Mure»ô. In 1997, he was elected an honorary member of the Romanian Academy. He died in Cluj-Napoca. Work Zaciu's first published work was a short biography of Duiliu Zamfirescu that appeared in Ecoul newspaper in 1944. His first prose fiction ran in FlacƒÉra magazine in 1948, at the beginning of the communist regime, while his first book-length fictional work was the 1954 Amiaza unei revolu»õii. His debut non-fiction volume was Masca geniului (1967), which featured criticism and literary history. A number of further critical essays and studies, as well as works of literary history, appeared in book form: Ion Ag√¢rbiceanu (1964; second edition, revised and enlarged, 1972), Glose (1970), Colaje (1972), Ordinea »ôi aventura (1973), Bivuac (1974), Lecturi »ôi zile (1975), Alte lecturi »ôi alte zile (1976), Lancea lui Ahile (1980), Cu cƒÉr»õile pe masƒÉ (1981), Viaticum (1983), Clasici »ôi contemporani (selections from previous books, 1994), Scrisori nimƒÉnui (1996), Ca o imensƒÉ scenƒÉ, Transilvania (1996; selection of prior essays about Transylvanian literature). Teritorii (1976) recorded his travel impressions; his massive diary, covering the period 1979‚Äì1989, was published in four volumes as Jurnal (I, 1993; II, 1995; III, 1996; IV, 1998); three theater plays appeared in the volume Sechestrul (1972). These were written in collaboration with Vasile Rebreanu; the two had previously worked on the screenplay for the 1965 film Gaudeamus igitur. Ion Buza»ôi, \\"Dialog epistolar\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, nr. 24/2004 He prepared and prefaced numerous editions of classical and contemporary Romanian authors, also putting together an anthology of Romanian short prose, Cu bilet circular (1974). Together with Marian Papahagi and Aurel Sasu, he initiated and coordinated a dictionary of Romanian writers, Scriitori rom√¢ni. Mic dic»õionar (1978). Expanded as Dic»õionarul scriitorilor rom√¢ni, with two volumes ready for printing in 1984, the revised work was banned the following year by the communist censors. The first volume was published only in 1995, after the Romanian Revolution, with the last appearing in 2002. Zaciu coordinated the \\"Restituiri\\" collection of Editura Dacia from Cluj; after 80 titles were published from 1972 to 1985, the series was suppressed for hidden reasons. He conceived and edited the volumes Ceasuri de searƒÉ cu Ion Ag√¢rbiceanu (1982) and Liviu Rebreanu dupƒÉ un veac (1985). He was awarded a number of prizes: the Academy prize for literary history (1975), the Cluj writers' association prize (1970), the Writers' Union prize for literary criticism (1976; 1981), the Octav »òulu»õiu Prize of Familia magazine (1992), the Bihor scientists' society prize (1993), the Satu Mare cultural prize (1994) and the Writers' Union prize for memoirs (1993). As the writers' dictionary coordinator, he won five awards in 1995: the national book salon prize, the Oradea book salon prize, the FlacƒÉra magazine prize, the BacƒÉu excellence prize and the Writers' Union Opera Magna prize. Mircea Zaciu, Interviuri, a volume of some forty interviews the author gave starting in 1972, was published in 2007. Ovidiu Pecican, \\"Un drum prin melancolie\\" , in Apostrof, nr. 3, 2008 Assessment Following his monograph on the work of Ion Ag√¢rbiceanu, Zaciu's criticism exclusively took the form of studies, essays and literary reviews, illustrating the author's interest both for the writings of previous centuries and for contemporary works. As a literary historian, he was devoted to an \\"active sentiment for tradition\\", analyzing older works for elements that would be taken up by later writers. His essays, invariably researched with care, had a marked ability to evoke the socio- literary environment of the period they describe, and to draw characters. In his writings, the archival sensibilities of the Cluj critical school merged with the example of George CƒÉlinescu; in his vision, literary history became a sui generis \\"novel\\" in which an era, a number of representative figures and \\"scenes\\" came alive. When writing about current literature, Zaciu reacted promptly, with assured verdicts and sometimes veering decidedly into polemics. He cherished precision and his criticism was sometimes colored by emotion, overall balancing the cool polemicist. In his need to be an active presence in ongoing developments, Zaciu mirrored the earlier example of Eugen Lovinescu. His talent for fiction was less developed, but a fine example of his prose can be found in Teritorii, the journalistic account of his German stay, together with impressions of Paris during the turbulent year 1968 as well as London. The publication of his journal was a literary event; it detailed moments, emotional states and events from the final years of the Nicolae Ceau»ôescu dictatorship, which he dubbed the \\"Satanic decade\\". The diary is a valuable document for reconstituting the somber and hopeless atmosphere of those years, with special attention devoted to the writers' milieu. In often memorable sketches, he recorded its main figures and the public disguises they wore.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic»õionarul biografic al literaturii rom√¢ne, vol. II, pp. 853-54.

When she moved in 1886 to Ballarat to live with her grandparents, her grandfather Henry Evans Baker, who worked as the first superintendent at the Ballarat Observatory, infused in her deep interest in scientific instruments, creative thinking, and evolution. She then took keen interest in acquiring knowledge of scientific photography. She studied at Clarendon School, Mount Pleasant State School, and Grenville College. She then studied at Ballarat East School of Art, followed by acquiring knowledge about colours and compositions at the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery's school under the guidance of P. M. Carew-Smyth. In 1892, she also learned to play piano under Edgar Nicolas, well known pianist, and gave piano performances at the Royal South Street Eisteddfod, and also won prizes.  Photographer  In 1898, she developed her interest in photography in Perth and then at Ballarat in 1899; she started taking photographs with a quarter-plate camera which was given to her by her aunt Pheme (Henry Baker's sister). Initially, she made albums of these photographs and presented them to her parents. In 1900, she moved to Black Rock, Melbourne, and lived with her great aunt Euphemia, who was a headmistress and whose success influenced her. In 1914 she published a booklet of Australian Wild Flowers which contained seven hand-coloured photographs taken by her. This booklet was republished in 1917, 1921, and 1922. She also made and sold fine wooden toys, made doll houses for charity, and painted water-colours of Australian flowers.  Bah√° º√≠ Faith  In 1922, there was a major shift in her religious faith when she met Clara Dunn and John Henry Hyde Dunn, who were propagating the Bah√° º√≠ Faith that had been established in Persia during the nineteenth century. She attended their lecture on the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Melbourne along with her friend Ruby Beaver. She was so strongly influenced by the teachings of this faith that she became a Bah√° º√≠ in 1922. She was the first woman who converted to this faith in Australia.  Documenting the Bah√° º√≠ religions  A Kodak 1A-Autographic (Kodak junior), a type of camera that Effie Baker used when in Haifa. In 1923, Baker traveled to Tasmania, Western Australia, and New Zealand along with Martha Root, a Bah√° º√≠ teacher and Esperantist. When she wanted to visit the Bah√° º√≠ holy shrines at Haifa, Palestine she suffered from lead poisoning due to licking her paintbrushes. However, she continued on the pilgrimage in January 1925, hoping that the voyage by sea would cure her. After her pilgrimage she lived in England for six months. She then accepted an invitation from Shoghi Effendi, The Guardian (head) of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, to live in Haifa, as hostess of a new hostel meant for Bah√° º√≠ pilgrims from western countries. While working there she made many friends. Shoghi Effendi liked her photographic work, and included the photographs she had taken of monument gardens on Mount Carmel and others in the Bah√° º√≠ yearbook. In 1930, at the request of Effendi, Baker toured incognito, mostly dressed in black chador, to take pictures of the origins of the Bab√≠ and Bah√° º√≠ religions. The travel in the Middle East was then risky for women, and Bah√° º√≠s were subject to persecution. Under these conditions she traveled for 8 months between 1930 and 1931 and took a thousand pictures of locations and monuments related to the history of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, in spite of lack of facilities and photographic materials; 400 of these pictures have been published. She had developed the films under moonlight and ensured that each picture was good before leaving that location. After this tour she returned to Haifa. Shoghi Effendi included some of the photographs taken by her as part of his book The Dawn-Breakers (1932), which was a translation of Nab√≠l-i-A ªzam's book on the religions' origins.  Return to Australia and later life  In February 1936, Baker returned to Goldsborough and lived with her mother and later with her sister from 1945. In 1963 she moved to a small apartment at Paddington in Sydney, where the Bah√° º√≠ national headquarters then were. She worked at the Bah√° º√≠ headquarters as a hostess and attended to the archives. Baker died on 1 January 1968 at Waverley. She was given a Bah√° º√≠ funeral and buried at the Mona Vale cemetery on 4 January. The service was well attended, in particular by the people of Bah√° º√≠ Faith who came from Yerrinbool Summer School.

Early history India's first contact with Lithuania was through Lithuanian Christian missionaries who traveled to India in the 16th century. Lithuanian interest in India grew in the 19th century after the similarity between Sanskrit and the Lithuanian language was discovered. Among European languages, Lithuanian is grammatically closest to Sanskrit. Lithuanians regard their language to be the oldest living Indo- European language. Vyd≈´nas, known as the Mahatma Gandhi and Sri Aurobindo of Lithuania, was interested in Indian philosophy, and created his own philosophical system closely based on the Vedanta. Vydunas stated that Lithuanian spiritual culture, prior to the introduction of Christianity, shared similarities with Hinduism, including the concept of Trinity. Jewish South African architect Hermann Kallenbach, who was born in the western Lithuanian town of Rusnƒó, was a close friend and associate of Mahatma Gandhi. The two met in 1904 in South Africa. Kallenbach accompanied Gandhi in his first fast, and his final departure from South Africa to London in 1914. Kallenbach also donated 1,000 acres of land that would later become Tolstoy Farm for satyagrahis in Transvaal. On 2 October 2015, Gandhi's 146th birth anniversary, Lithuanian Prime Minister Algirdas Butkeviƒçius and Indian Minister of State for Agriculture Mohanbhai Kundariya unveiled a statue of Kallenbach and Gandhi in Rusnƒó. Lithuanian ambassador to India Laimonas Talat- Kelp≈°a remarked, \\"The monument comes as a testimony to Indo-Lithuanian friendship. Above the many things that connect our two nations, the monument to Gandhi and Kallenbach will tower as a symbol epitomising a single individual's impact on the larger history of mankind. While Gandhi gave the world the concept of non-violent resistance, which Lithuania also successfully employed during its struggle with the Soviet oppression, Kallenbach was pivotal in shaping Gandhi's ideas and testing them in practice. We believe this monument in Rusnƒó will serve as a powerful reminder that one man also matters in history.\\" Modern history India recognized Lithuania on 9 September 1991, and established diplomatic relations on 25 February 1992. Jagannath Doddamani served as the first ambassador of India to Lithuania (residing in Poland) from 1992 to 1994. The first ambassador of Lithuania to India was Petras ≈†imeli≈´nas who served from 2011 to 2012. Prime Minister Adolfas ≈†le≈æeviƒçius visited India in September 1995, and President Valdas Adamkus visited in February 2001. The Indian embassy in Warsaw, Poland is jointly accredited to Lithuania. Lithuania opened an embassy in New Delhi on 1 July 2008. In 2005, Indian Foreign Minister K. Natwar Singh stated that India would open an embassy in Lithuania. In July 2014, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Antanas Linkeviƒçius urged India to open an embassy in Vilnius. India has not yet opened an embassy in the country, although it opened an honorary consulate in Vilnius on 6 February 2015. In October 2015, India and Lithuania signed a bilateral agreement on co-operation in agriculture. They also agreed to increase their co-operation in sectors such as food and dairy processing. Economic relations Bilateral trade between the two nations totaled US$117.9 million in 2009, $184 million in 2010 and $203 million in 2011. India's major exports to Lithuania are pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, textiles and consumer goods. Lithuania's main exports to India are machinery and mechanical appliances, high tech optical instruments, base metals and articles of base metal, chemicals, sulphur, lime and cement. The Indian Baltic Chamber of Commerce (IBCC) was established in Vilnius in 2009. The India-Lithuania Forum was inaugurated in September 2010. Cultural relations There is growing interest in Lithuania for Indian dance and music, yoga, ayurveda, and the works of Rabindranath Tagore. Ayurveda centres function in Vilnius and Kaunas. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) is present in Lithuania, and Sai Baba had over 200 devotees in the country, as of 2012. The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) has sponsored several performances by Indian troupes in Lithuania.  Tourism  As of 2014, around 3,000 Lithuanian citizens visit India annually.  Indian diaspora in Lithuania As of August 2013, around 300 Indian citizens lived in Lithuania. The majority were students, while the rest were engaged in business activities. Many Indians are employed at the OP Lohia Group's PET plant in Klaipƒóda. The Indian information technology sector often sends Indian citizens to temporarily work on projects in Lithuania.

Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as the titular Gunther alongside Killam, Cobie Smulders, and Bobby Moynihan. It was released on video on demand on September 22, 2017, before being given a limited theatrical release on October 20, 2017 by Saban Films.  Plot  Blake, an assassin, wants to kill the world's most notorious hitman, Gunther. Hiring a camera crew to document the process for video proof, Blake assembles a team: his friend Donnie, an explosives expert; Sanaa, daughter of legendary hitman Rahmat Fairouza; Gabe, an inexperienced technology 'expert'; and Ashley, Blake's elderly mentor, who has a heart attack. Blake recruits more hitmen: Izzat, a former Islamist extremist with an extremely strong robotic arm; Yong, who only uses poisons; psychotic twins Mia and Barold Bellakalakova; and Max, Blake's former partner. The group gathers in a warehouse, but before Max can reveal Gunther's location, Gunther kills him with a sniper rifle and disappears. Blake is motivated by the fact that his ex, Lisa, left him for Gunther, though that relationship did not last; Blake still carries a cigarette case from her. Ashley has another heart attack seconds after leaving the hospital. The team sets up a fake hit in Miami to draw Gunther out, and visit Cheyenne, a gun dealer. They pursue Gunther after he kills the target; Gunther kills Izzat with his own robotic arm, but Sanaa manages to wound Gunther before he escapes. Yong leads the team to the office of an underground doctor where Gunther is being treated. Donnie plants a bomb in Gunther's car, which fails to detonate, but Gunther has booby-trapped the entire street. Discovering the car's trunk is full of venomous snakes, Yong is killed when one leaps out and bites him in the neck. Another car picks up Gunther, but Sanaa opens fire and the car crashes. Finding both occupants dead, the team celebrate drunkenly at a bar, and Blake sleeps with the bartender, while Sanaa and Donnie spend the night together. The team is awakened in the middle of the night by Rahmat trying to kill Donnie for sleeping with his daughter, claiming that Blake texted him. Realizing it must have been Gunther, they find the Bellakalakova twins dead in bed. Donnie goes into hiding from Rahmat, who is pursued by Sanaa. Forced to lay low at Gabe's cramped apartment with the documentary crew, Blake is contacted by Donnie, who wants to retire to be with Sanaa. Blake tries to visit Lisa, and leaves her all the letters he had written while they were apart, revealing he was afraid that someone would hurt her to get to him. He once again picks up Ashley from the hospital, who dies of a final heart attack. At Ashley's funeral, Sanaa reveals she is pregnant, and a bomb explodes in Ashley's grave, killing Gabe. Guilt-stricken, Blake abandons the mission, until Lisa gives him Gunther's home address. After leaving a voicemail for Donnie, Blake infiltrates the house alone with the documentary crew. He engages in a shootout with Gunther, and is joined by Sanaa and Donnie. They are confronted by another camera crew and Gunther reveals himself, having been making his own documentary about the team and their efforts to kill him. He further reveals that he was Cheyenne and the bartender in disguise. Gunther offers them the choice to retire peacefully or die. Donnie, Sanaa, and Blake's camera crew leave, and Gunther reveals he has kidnapped Lisa, warning that if Blake kills him, his armed camera crew will kill Lisa. Gunther shoots Blake but is disarmed by Lisa, who kills his camera crew with Blake, saved by his cigarette case. Sending Lisa to safety, Blake is overpowered by Gunther, who disappears as the police arrive. One year later, Donnie and Sanaa are happily married and have a daughter; threatened into converting to Islam, Donnie finally has Rahmat's respect. Lisa has remarried, and Blake has disappeared. Gunther has retired to his native Austria, having maliciously introduced Lisa to her new husband. Completing an interview with the documentary crew, he is shot by Blake. Celebrating at finally killing Gunther, Blake discovers Gunther is wearing a bomb vest which explodes, killing Blake and the camera crew. The Austrian authorities give a press conference, where one of the reporters is revealed to be Gunther in disguise.

During her life she created two lay conservatories, Il Conventino and La Quiete. Her work has played a large role in the evolution of education for women.  Life  Portrait of Eleonora Ramirez di MontalvoEleonora Ramirez di Montalvo was born in 1602 in Genoa, Italy. Her mother was Italian and her father was Spanish. Montalvo's father died when she was 5 years old. At the age of nine she was taken to the convent of San Jacopo in Via Ghibellina. She remained there for nine years.Jennifer Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls in seventeenth-century Florence: Eleonora Ramirez di Montalvo, her lay conservatories and writings\\" (Dissertation, The University of Chicago,2010) 19. In 1620 she was removed from the convent and married to Orazio Landi. Five years after the marriage they separated. Though they were separated they remained married until Landi died in 1656 . Montalvo died shortly after in 1659.Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 19.  Education of Young Girls  In 1626 Montalvo began taking in poor and needy girls. She supported them financially as well as giving them religious, moral and cultural instruction.Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 20. In 1627 her and the girls began moving to various houses until eventually in 1642 they moved to ‚Äúcasa dei Brandolini‚Äù in Via dell‚ÄôAmore. They called it Il Conventino. The school itself was named the Congregation of the Ancille della Santissima Vergine or Handmaidens of the Blessed Virgin.Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 20. Women from different backgrounds were welcome at Il Conventino. According to Jennifer Haraguchi, Montalvo struggled to ‚Äúreconcile her desire to provide education to young women of all social classes with the Florentine Church‚Äôs position which at the time did not include the education of the poor.‚Äù Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 44. Eventually Montalvo desired to separate the girls of higher social status away from the girls of lower social class.Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 21. In 1650 Montalvo opened a second conservatory for aristocratic girls located at Villa La Quiete. The school was named the Congregation of the Ancille della Santissima Trinit√† or Handmaidens of the Blessed Trinity.Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 22. Though they were separate, Montalvo ‚Äúadvocated a combined instruction in religion, morals, reading, music, and dramatic performance‚Äù at both schools.Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 33. Montalvo's unique educational pursuits were greatly supported by the Medici Family. Specifically, the Grand Duchess Vittoria della Rovere was a major supporter of Montalvo. She often made visits to La Quiete and completed the construction of a church there in 1688.Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 7.La Quiete today  Teachings  Montalvo considered her schools an alternative to the roles of wife or nun that young girls often had to choose between during this time.Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 50. In both conservatories Montalvo encouraged the teaching of writing, music, drama, domestic work, reading, sewing, and lessons on moral virtue.Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 9. Though this level of education was typical for elite girls, most poor young girls worked as servants during this time period.Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 9. While the curriculum at La Quiete was more advanced than Il Conventino's, the young elite were also taught how to complete domestic tasks such as cooking and cleaning laundry. Both Il Conventino and La Quiete ‚Äúpushed the boundaries of educational expectations.\\"Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 9. Montalvo used theatre specifically as a major component of her curriculum. This was not always the case. Originally Montalvo considered theatre a distraction and thus banned its practice in the Costituzioni of 1645. Fifteen years later she had changed her mind. In the Constituzioni for the Ancille della Santissma Trinita she permits the performance of plays that are based on the lives of saints.Elissa Weaver, Convent theatre in early modern Italy: spiritual fun and learning for women (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 199.  Writing  Montalvo produced several works throughout her life. She wrote several administrative handbooks for her conservatories: the Costituzioni (Regulations) of 1645 written for Il Conventino, the Costituzioni of 1656‚Äì7 for La Quiete, and the Istruzione alle maestre (Instruction for Teachers) for the teachers of La Quiete. Montalvo also composed a vita or autobiography that was never finished.Jenifer Haraguchi, ‚ÄúVita di Eleonora: A Unique Example of Autobiographical Writing in Counter-Reformation Italy,‚Äù I Tatti Studies in the Italian Renaissance 17.2 (2014): 373. Montalvo was originally instructed to write her vita in 1636 by her confessor, Cosimo Pazzi.Haraguchi, ‚ÄúVita di Eleonora,‚Äù 370. It was typical for catholic confessors to instruct women to write spiritual autobiographies or vita. These scittura segreta (secret writing) were meant to be analyzed by confessors so that they could better meet the woman's spiritual needs.Haraguchi, ‚ÄúVita di Eleonora,‚Äù 369. Montalvo worked on her vita for 23 years. She began in 1636 (age 34) and continued to work on it until her death in 1659. This was not common for most women.Haraguchi, ‚ÄúVita di Eleonora,‚Äù 370. Women were often commanded to write extensive accounts of their entire spiritual life and were given very little time. Once completed these accounts would be confiscated immediately and would sometimes be used to condemn the female authors as heretics.Haraguchi, ‚ÄúVita di Eleonora,‚Äù 370. Montalvo also composed many other works. She wrote plays, prayers, dramatic hagiographies, and two spiritual comedies: Rappresentazione delle virt√π e de‚Äô vizi (The Play of the Virtues and Vices) and Rappresentazione delli inganni della propria opinione (The Tricks Played By One's Own Opinion). Rappresentazione delle virt√π e de‚Äô vizi is about the struggle between the virtues ‚ÄúPrudence, Humility, Peace, Modesty, and Happiness‚Äù and the vices of ‚ÄúStupidity, Dissoluteness, Discord, and Melancholy.‚ÄùWeaver, Convent theatre, 200. Her second play, Rappresentazione delli inganni della propria opinione, is about ‚Äúthe danger of trusting one‚Äôs own opinion and opposing the good rule of the superiors.‚ÄùWeaver, Convent theatre, 202. Bartolomeo Guidi explains that all of Montalvo's works were ‚Äúintended for the instruction, inspiration, and enjoyment of the young women of her conservatories.\\"Haraguchi, ‚ÄúVita di Eleonora,‚Äù 375. In a broader context, writing sacred literature was not completely uncommon for women during this time. At the beginning of the 1580s a push to create religious narratives was just beginning. Montalvo was one of the first women to begin producing such works along with other women of the time.Virginia Cox, The prodigious muse: women's writing in counter-reformation Italy (Baltimore: JHU Press, 2011), 130.  Legacy  Example of a spinet Jennifer Haraguchi states: > Montalvo was a pioneer in women‚Äôs education who pushed against societal > expectations that young women should prepare themselves only for marriage or > the convent. Montalvo offered a revolutionary ‚Äòthird path‚Äô where women ‚Äî > affluent or not ‚Äî did not have to be nuns to increase their knowledge of > spiritual concepts and to have intense spiritual experiencesHaraguchi, > \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 17-18. Today, Montalvo's spinet and bedroom are preserved at La Quiete. Several of her personal items have been kept, including her bed, blankets, devotional objects, her oil lamp, eating utensils, and several items of clothing.Haraguchi, \\"Educating rich and poor girls\\" 32.

The state Nomenclature Committee had recommended in 1916 that the post office be renamed 'Metiappa', an abridgement of 'Piltimetiappa', the Aboriginal name for a local creek and the name of another local station, but there is no record of this having occurred before the closure. The Collinsville property developed as a famous merino stud, and upon Collins' death, The Advertiser described his family firm as \\"among the best studmasters in Australia\\". The historic Collinsville Homestead Complex and the Piltimittiappa Homestead are both listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. Much of the Caroona Creek Conservation Park lies within Collinsville.

Their studies of such protein targeting pathways are revealing how membrane proteins are accurately recognised by the machinery responsible for their proper localisation and insertion. Hegde's work has also shown that even modest failures of individual proteins to reach their correct cellular location can lead to neurodegeneration, and that cells have specialised pathways to identify these wayward proteins and target them for destruction. , according to Google Scholar his most cited research include papers published in Science, Nature, and Cell.

Biography  From Pittsburgh, Angianlee was born c. 1927 as Charles Brown. She joined the Navy in 1950 to be able to receive treatment for rectal and nasal bleeding. While serving, she was diagnosed at the US Naval Hospital in Philadelphia for what was described as \\"a serious mental illness,\\" wanting to be female. The examinations also led to the discovery of \\"female glands,\\" showing that Carlett was intersex. Opposing the doctor's recommendation to have them surgically removed, Carlett decided instead to seek out a different type of surgery, sex reassignment surgery. Angianlee began writing to surgeons in Germany, Denmark, and Yugoslavia to see about getting SRS. Dr. Christian Hamburger responded saying citizenship was needed to have it done in Denmark. She wrote to West Germany‚Äôs Minister of Justice Dr. Thomas Dehler and was told the same. At some point, she arranged to gain citizenship and for the surgery to occur in Bonn, Germany, starting with hormone and cortisone injections. Part of her desire to become a woman stemmed from her desire to marry Sgt. Eugene Martin, who was stationed in Germany at the time. Claiming a two and a half year relationship with the man, she said that \\"We‚Äôll be married as soon as I am legally a woman.\\" Once out of the navy, she moved to Boston where she made a living by working as a shake dancer and by selling her blood and plasma. Between June 18 and 25, 1953, Angianlee legally changed her name to Carlett Brown Angianlee, who was stationed in Germany. She had renounced her American citizenship and planned to sail to Europe on the SS Holland on August 2. Once there, she had planned doctors appointments to begin her transition. About a month later, Agianlee made the decision to postpone the trip in order to undergo a $500 face lift in New York City from Dr. George J.B. Weiss. Within the following month, she was ordered not to leave the country by the US government until she had paid $1,200 in back taxes. To make more money to be able to pay this off, she got a job as a chief at an Iowa State College fraternity. Nothing beyond this point is known about her, and it is unknown if she ever made it to Europe.

Biography  Born into a family of the nobility of the Dauphin√© of which he was the last representative, he studied law at Grenoble, then joined the army in 1812. From 1814 to 1817 he was part of the military house of Louis XVIII Which in consideration to his young age is considered suspicious by biographers. The source of this saying comes from an article published in L'Entr'acte Lyonnais 28 April 1838. In 1819, he moved to Paris and became a friend of Charles Nodier who introduced him into the literary circles. He made his debut in literature in 1821 with a sentimental novel, Souvenirs de madame Jenny L.. The success he obtained with some of his plays performed in Paris allowed him to establish a dramatic performance center in Lyon (1824).

It is one of the 10 opera houses in Poland and the only one of this size in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. Opera Nova also welcomes the scene of the Bydgoszcz Buratino Puppet Theatre. Location Opera Nova building is located in a bend of the Brda river between Old Town and Downtown Bydgoszcz. The opera House is connected with a footbridge over the Brda river to Mill Island (): from the surrounding terrace it overlooks Bydgoszcz Cathedral, and Mill Island's granaries and mills. Characteristics Opera Nova is a cultural institution co-administrated by Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage & Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. It realizes artistic activities comprising operas, operettas, ballets and musicals. Its activities also include educational projects, such as introducing opera and ballet to children. The Opera Nova company performs in Bydgoszcz, but also in other opera festivals in Poland and abroad. Since 1989, the ensemble has made numerous tours to Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Malta and Italy. Opera Nova extends its cultural influence out of Kuyavia-Pomerania, reaching audience and artists to neighboring provinces (Pi≈Ça, Koszalin, Olsztyn). The repertoire includes operettas, musicals, opera galas; it attracts a very enthusiastic and popular public. Financial sponsors of the Opera Nova, critical for such an institution, come from many financial and industrial tycoons in the area. Maciej Figas is since 1992 the director of the Opera Nova, he is also the conductor of the opera orchestra. In 2014 more than 82,000 people came to the Opera Nova. Bird eye view History =First times= The history of the theater in Bydgoszcz dates back to the 17th century, when was built a special theatre hall in the city Jesuit College, able to accommodate approximately 300 people. In the 19th century, operas and operettas were played in the Prussian Municipal Theatre; from 1896 to 1920, opera companies from Gda≈Ñsk, Poznan or Rostock performed in Bromberg. In the years 1920-1939, a cultural institution run by the German minority called Deutsche B√ºhne () was located in the backyard of Gdanska 66/68. It was a professional theatre, which displayed opera ensembles and orchestra performances based on the local Bydgoszcz Conservatoire located at Mickiewicz Alley N¬∞9. Its popularity matched Municipal Theatre. Deutsche B√ºhne staged operas, operettas, musicals and vaudeville, hosting German companies (Berlin, Hamburg, K√∂nigsberg). On May 3, 1930, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Jan Kochanowski's birth, the theatre premiered \\"The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys\\" (), as a tribute to the Polish community. After 1933, its repertoire followed the cultural Nazi propaganda diktats. The first Polish opera in Bydgoszcz was founded in 1919. On October 3, 1921, members of Bydgoszcz Municipal Theatre presented the Polish national opera, Stanislaw Moniuszko's Halka. From 1921 to 1923, the Municipal Theatre organized summer opera seasons, with companies from Poznan and Warsaw opera houses. There were also recital singers with eminent artists from the world of Polish opera and operetta. Between 1923 and 1926, series of concerts in Bydgoszcz starred among others, Stanis≈Çaw Gruszczy≈Ñski, Ignacy Dygas, Jadwiga Dƒôbicka, Victoria Kawecka. In 1926, the first recital of New York's Metropolitan Opera's bass Adamo Didur had a huge success in the city. The Municipal Theatre invited several times in the 1920s and 1930s Ada Sari for recital performances with piano. For the season 1925/1926, an institution was created, the Pomeranian Opera Theatre of Bydgoszcz-Torun-Grudziadz directed by Karol Benda. The company included a 36-musician orchestra, a 22-singer chorus, a small ballet and external individuals from Warsaw, Poznan and Lviv. In addition, operetta guests were outstanding Polish artists of the time (Matilda Lewi≈Ñska-Poli≈Ñska, Ignacy Dygas, Stanis≈Çaw Gruszczy≈Ñski, Jan Kiepura, Lucyna Messal). The Pomeranian Opera performed in the Municipal Theatre 15 premieres and 69 operas and operettas, such as Halka, Rigoletto, Tosca, Carmen, Madama Butterfly, Aida, Countess Maritza, The Gay Hussars, The Merry Widow. View from Mill Island marina During 11 seasons (1927-1938), the director Wladyslaw Stoma enlarged the repertoire of operas and operettas performed in the Bydgoszcz Municipal Theatre. In many instances, new pieces from Berlin and the Vienna have been specially translated for the Bydgoszcz institution. Wladyslaw Stoma hired professional singers and the orchestra acquired military professionals from the 61st Infantry Regiment () billeted in Pomorska Street. In the 1930s, the theatre staged with its own company forces (soloists, orchestra, choirs) operas Halka, La Traviata (1930), The Tales of Hoffmann, Madama Butterfly (1931), Carmen (1932), in addition to host every year Warsaw Opera performances. The last musical premiere before the outbreak World War II was Susanna, on April 4, 1939. Throughout the interwar period, performances were staged in the Municipal Theatre: Bydgoszcz did not possess yet any opera house. In German occupation times, the Municipal Theatre was intended \\"only for Germans\\" and manned by a German-Latvian troupe from Riga under the direction of Heinrich Voit. The inaugural session on October 1, 1940, staged von Weber's opera Der Freisch√ºtz. The repertoire of the theater until 1944 included several musical performances (opera, operetta, ballet evenings), and also Municipal Symphony Orchestra performances. In 1944, the German scene gave way to a decorated cinema building showing propaganda films. After the end of World War II, efforts were made to create a permanent Opera facility in Bydgoszcz, but despite large popular audience, the initiative did not get approval from the authorities, which did not believed in the success of the project. To overcome the situation, opera sessions were held by the Pomeranian Symphony Orchestra, together with Bydgoszcz Choirs, to perform opera overtures, fragments of orchestral and choral opera. =Opera Studio= Opera Studio (), created on December 15, 1955, at the initiative of the Music Society. \\"I. J. Paderewski\\", was the first step towards a professional opera theater in Bydgoszcz. The initiator of the project was Felicia Krysiewicz, a singer, pianist and animator of musical life in Bydgoszcz. View from Mill Island In January 1956, an agreement for a working structure was reached with the cooperation of Pomeranian Philharmonic, Arion choir in Bydgoszcz and the Social Music and Ballet department: orchestra was directed by Zdzislaw Wendy≈Ñski, the choir by Antoni Rybka and the ballet by Raymond Sobiesiak. In May 1956, the Citizens' Committee for the Creation of Musical Theatre was established under the lead of Kazimierz Maludzi≈Ñski. On September 21, 1956, the inauguration of the Opera Studio premiered Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko's Flis and Verbum nobile, and Karol Kurpi≈Ñski's ballets The Marriage Fathers (), with 150 people, including 20 solo-singers, 30 ballet dancers, 40 orchestra players and 60 chorus singers. In 1958 was created an institution called Bydgoszcz Comedy Music () which aim was to perform in summer time operettas and musical pieces with tailored ensembles. Led by J√≥zef Szurka, it had realized by the end of the 1980s around 1500 performances throughout the country, mainly in small towns. Opera Studio repertoire gave the lion's share to comic opera and operetta classics. Performances were held in the building of the Polish Theatre in Mickiewicz Alley, in various clubs and occasionally in the hall of the Pomeranian House of Art. During its four-year activity, Opera Studio gave 10 premieres and around 400 performances, including 34 outside Bydgoszcz (Torun, Grudziadz, Inowroc≈Çaw, ≈öwiecie) which attracted an audience of 22 000. In 1958, thanks to minister credits, full-time soloists were engaged, as well as half-time choir, ballet and administration individuals. On April 10, 1958, the first ballet was played, The Nutcracker by Tchaikovsky, and on July 2, Offenbach's operetta Orpheus in the Underworld. Opera Studio was renamed on March 3, 1959, Musical Theatre of Opera and Operetta (), so as to meet cultural expectations of the inhabitants of the entire Bydgoszcz Voivodeship. A year later, on March 1, 1960, the institution was nationalized. In 1963, the Musical Theatre of Opera and Operetta had then its own orchestra established, putting an end to the use of musicians from the Pomeranian Philharmonic. =State Opera and Operetta in Bydgoszcz= Bydgoszcz musical scene, once nationalised, changed its name several times: Opera and Operetta (1964), National Opera (1980), Opera Nova (1990), and from 1996, Opera Nova - State Opera in Bydgoszcz. Until the mid-1990s, the institution did not have its own facility: it used the Pomeranian Art House building and three times a week staged in Polish Theatre in Bydgoszcz. In spite of these unusual conditions, the company gained there its first experience and several artists who started here, appeared later on national stages in Warsaw, Lodz or Poznan: Barbara Zag√≥rzanka (soprano), Lidia Skowron, Bo≈ºena Kinasz-Miko≈Çajczak, Bo≈ºena Betley, El≈ºbieta Hoffmann, Monika Olkisz-Chabros (soprano) Henryk K≈Çosi≈Ñski (tenor), Bronis≈Çaw Pekowski (bass-baritone), and others. Besides, the troupe hosted the greatest opera artists: Maria Foltyn (1960), Antonina Kawecka (1962), Bogna Sokorska (1960), Krystyna Szczepa≈Ñska (1964), Teresa ≈ªylis-Gara (1959), Wies≈Çaw Ochman (1965), Bernard ≈Åadysz (1960), Bogdan Paprocki (1962), Ryszard Tarasiewicz (1970) Marcin Bronikowski (1994, 2012). The Bydgoszcz opera executed works by contemporary composers, who had their world premieres: musicals Hel of Jerzy Lawiny-≈öwiƒôtochowski and Ryszard Damrosz (1965), opera Przemys≈Çaw II by Henryk Swolkie≈Ñ (1986), ballets Anna Karenina by Radion Shchedrin (1979), Bernadett Matuszczak's Wild swans (1992) and Bogdan Pawlowski's Puss in boots (1997). Many companies from East and West countries came to Bydgoszcz stage and Opera Nova ensembles toured abroad, mainly to Western Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg), performing at numerous opera festivals. These foreign contacts resulted in an enhanced cooperation with opera music centers in Europe. Opera house by night In the 1960s, operas and operettas were performed far out Bydgoszcz Voivodeship, in places like Pi≈Ça, Wa≈Çcz, Zielona G√≥ra, Konin, P≈Çock, ≈ªary. Most popular couple on stage was then Barbara Zag√≥rzanka and Henryk Herdzin. In 1971, Bydgoszcz Opera and Operetta had cumulated 2200 performances watched by 1.2 million people. Guest soloists from socialist countries and outstanding Polish artists were invited, such as: Bernard ≈Åadysz, Bogdan Paprocki, Antonina Kawecka, Krystyna Szczepa≈Ñska and Wieslaw Ochman. The idea to build a new seat for the Opera company in Bydgoszcz appeared in 1960 and was strongly supported by the then director of Pomeranian Philharmonic, Andrzej Szwalbe. It was the only solution to avoid performances being scattered in several smaller stages all around the city (Polish Theatre, Chamber Theatre, Pomeranian House of Arts or movie theatre). These scenes were not fitted at all for soloists, choir, ballet and orchestra. In 1973, building started in a picturesque bend of the Brda river. Completion of the facility kept being delayed by high costs of construction and the deficit in materials and contractors. In the 1980s, facing budget cuts for culture, work came to a halt: some attempts were made to use the unfinished building, and realize cultural activities, like the first Bydgoszcz Opera Festival in 1994. Bydgoszcz Opera Festival was a good omen for the future Opera Nova. Staged operas, operettas and ballets helped to appreciate the capabilities of exposing the great forms of stage in a new building, the acoustic qualities of the auditorium, the technical capacities of the scene and the skills of the orchestra, choir and ballet. In 1996, the Opera Nova employed 170 people, including 23 soloists, 30 ballet dancers, 44 chorus singers, 56 musicians and others (conductors, directors...). The repertoire comprised 18 pieces: 8 operas, 4 operettas, 4 ballets and 2 musicals. After 1996, the company realised about 200 performances, including 110 Bydgoszcz and more than 90 abroad (mainly in Germany, Austria, Netherlands and Belgium). Since 1996-1997, Opera Nova performances attract approximately 40 000 per season. On October 21, 2006, the Bydgoszcz Opera House celebrated the 50th anniversary of the opera company in the city, together with the official completion of the Opera Nova building. =Performances= In May 2016, Opera Nova had staged the most famous works of opera, operetta, ballet and musical since its inception, among others: * Carmen (1964,1991,1999) * Faust (1960,2015) * The Tales of Hoffmann (1959,1998) * Manon (1979) * La Boh√®me (1978,2011) * Tosca (1966,1984,2004) * Madama Butterfly (1961,1981) * Suor Angelica (1992) * Gianni Schicchi (1992) * Turandot (1996) * The Barber of Seville (1957,1972,1987,2002) * La Cenerentola (1967,1985,2009,2015) * The Magic Flute (1971,1994) * Don Giovanni (1997) * The Marriage of Figaro (1979) * Der Schauspieldirektor (1970,1991) * Eugene Onegin (1962,1980) * Prince Igor (1975) * Nabucco (1995) * La Traviata (1964,1981,1998,2015) * Rigoletto (1967,1986,2014) * Il trovatore (1973) * Un ballo in maschera (1984) * Aida (1968,1985) * Don Carlos (1972,2016) * Otello (1989) * The Flying Dutchman (1977) * The Haunted Manor (1958,1976,1994) * Halka (1961,1981,2013) * The Countess (1960,1982) * Swan Lake (1972) * The Nutcracker (1958,1986,2015) * The sleeping Beauty (1994) * Don Quixote (1996) * The Gypsy Baron (1957,1980,1991) * Die Fledermaus (1961,1982,1995) * Eine Nacht in Venedig (1985) * The Land of Smiles (1970,1978,1994) * The Merry Widow (1966,1988) * Orpheus in the Underworld (1958,1983,1991 - adaptation under the title \\"Who wanted to kidnap Euridice?\\") * Fiddler on the Roof (1992) * My Fair Lady (1993,2008,2016). Opera House =History= Old military mess and casino in 1890 The idea of a building dedicated to the Bydgoszcz Opera dates back to the 1950s and 1960s, soon after the nationalization of the institution. The first initiative came from Andrzej Schwalbe, then director of the Pomeranian Philharmonic: for him it was clear from the start that the co-existence in the long run under one roof of two companies and orchestras could not achieve the needed artistic stability. Rationale was the successful attendance at opera performances and the lack of large auditoriums in the city, capable of satisfying the growing artistic aspirations of the public. In 1961, a meeting between representatives of Bydgoszcz Music Society, Musical Theatre, Pomeranian Philharmonic, administrative authorities and architects, agreed to launch the project of a musical theater with two scenes and an art caf√©. Different locations were considered for the future opera house: the place of the former Municipal Theatre, or Ludowy Park on Jagiello≈Ñska street, or again on the heights of Bydgoszcz. Finally the area chosen was the one between Focha street, Theatre square and Brda river. There have been standing large granaries -\\"Royal granaries\\" ()- which burnt down in the 1960s. Only buildings left in the 1960s were military facilities (warehouses, mess, garrison command). Former Royal Granaries In May, the Association of Polish Architects announced a national contest to \\"develop the architectural design of the building of Musical Theatre and Drama in Bydgoszcz\\". Jury comprised architects of Bydgoszcz, Gda≈Ñsk, Poznan, Warsaw, and representatives from the Ministry of Culture and Art and the Pomeranian Philharmonic in Bydgoszcz. The prize winner was a young architect, Joseph Chmiel, who was also the author of the project for the Musical Theatre in Gdynia. The project presented an edifice composed of four intersecting circles, integrated into the meander of the Brda river. In 1962, the design phase of the building started, supported by the Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. The investment was planned in two steps, the first one from 1966 to 1971, the second stage after 1972. Contrary to expectations, construction did not start immediately, due to the delaying design work. The building has been planned to use of all modern technical capacities: extended stage depth and proscenium, designed trapdoor and an external platform, which could lift the stage up to height meters. A panoramic scene portal was designed, with a fireproof front curtain, allowing, if necessary, an increased stage space. In this manner, the auditorium could be able function as a theatre scene and a conference stage. The auditorium itself has been designed on the model of a theatre of ancient Greece, without any partition between loges and balconies, so that the audience could feel closer to the artists. In 1973, building permits were issued and handed over to Budopol, the municipal firm in charge of the work. From 1973 to 1976, National Company \\"Hydrobudowa 9\\" from Poznan dug into the soil 1100 concrete piles. In the following years, design assumptions changed: from four intersecting rings, plans went down to two then eventually three. Issues to get building materials were recurrent and in 1977, at the time to secure the investment Polish Prime Minister Piotr Jaroszewicz canceled the project for economical reasons. However, local First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party in Bydgoszcz, J√≥zef Majchrzak, decided to overrule Warsaw's decision by continuing the construction. Building of Opera Nova in 1990 Although works were expected to end in 1982, the economic crisis of the 1980s reduced severely state funds allocated for culture, interrupting the construction. Building became a symbol of \\"eternal investments\\" and few people believed in its completion. It is only in 1985, thanks to an increased effort of provincial administrative authorities and cultural lobbies, that the continuation of the construction was insured through the National Culture Development Fund. In 1986, former military warehouses and Headquarters Garrison were at last demolished, getting the work accelerated. Between 1990 and 1994, the main body of the edifice housing the auditorium and the main stage was glazed, and the work moved to dressing rooms and rehearsal rooms, all of which was carried out by a specialized Company, \\"Teatr\\" from Warsaw. With the end of communist era, the Fund for the Development of Culture was liquidated, putting another threat to postpone the completion of the building. Construction was then focusing on the third circle, planned to host offices (TVP3 Bydgoszcz), a convention center and restaurants. Around this date, initiative was taken to use the raw building to organize the first Bydgoszcz Opera Festival: main points were to draw attention of the public and decision makers on this important project and to raise funds for its achievement. The first Bydgoszcz Opera Festival took place from 17 to 30 April 1994, in the harsh surroundings of the building. The second half of 1990s brought a major positive change in the socio-political climate, helping out with investment, mainly from the provincial authorities. The construction of the Opera Nova in Bydgoszcz gained modern architectural solutions, new technologies, materials and theatrical capacities. The final stage of the investment occurred in the years 2002 to 2008: government of Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship decided to change the function of the third circle (originally, the area planned for production and decorations storage), so as to create a large convention center, where could be organized symposiums, meetings and congresses. Rationale behind such a decision was money related since the convention center approximately cost 20 million z≈Ç against 60 million z≈Ç for the initial project. The building officially started operating on October 21, 2006, with a gala celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Opera activity in Bydgoszcz. Construction of Bydgoszcz opera house lasted 34 years and 5 months and is considered one of the longest building projects for a theater in post-war Poland. The Lublin Musical theater, however, is second to none in this contest, since its project started in 1974 and has only been completed on November 22, 2015. In the years following its achievement, the Opera Nova has been used as a Regional Convention Center, organizing a number of cultural events and festivals. Since 2010, it houses the international Film festival Camerimage. To be able to accommodate the growing success of Camerimage, a project of extension is currently underway. A fourth lobe to the actual building will be added, comprising a projection room for about 350 seats and an exhibition centre. Architecture The building, by its own size, stands out in the architectural environment of the city centre: it has 6 levels, covers an area of 24 432 m2, has a volume of 120 700 m3 and a height of 34.19 m. Its location along the Brda river provides an opening to the Mill Island. The building, with its three connecting circles, affords optimal conditions for the realization of opera, operetta, ballet and musicals. Because of its original shape and position by the water, Opera Nova is often compared to the Sydney Opera House. The building has an illumination light system, one of Bydgoszcz hallmark by night. The First Circle hosts the main auditorium for 803 people, a large stage, two rehearsal rooms - for ballet and chorus, costumes storing area and a chamber hall with 189 seats (beneath the auditorium). It also houses workshops (clothing, hairdressing, wigs...) The Second circle houses a ventilation chamber in the basement, on the ground floor an actor club, a large orchestra hall and a ballet rehearsal area, two floors for dressing rooms (choir and ballet), and on the top floor administration offices. Main Auditorium at Opera Nova The Third circle is devoted to the Opera Nova Convention Center, with two conference rooms (more than 200 seats each), allowing the organization of large symposiums or seminars. There are also the Department of Promotion (entrance from Focha Street) and the restaurant \\"Maestra\\". =Interiors= The large auditorium has a capacity of 803 seating places and 6 seats for disabled, the scene covers an area of 420 m2 (22 m wide and 25 m deep), and houses theatre equipment and lighting, and a revolving stage (11,80 m diameter). The scene portal is 9,5 m high and 18 m wide. The front curtain is steel and textile made, comprising 6 layers (10 m high and 21 m wide). The hall has an appreciated acoustic; it gives onto the lobby and two mezzanines. \\"New Archer\\" The Chamber hall named after professor Felicia Krysiewicz, has 189 seats and 3 places for disabled. This Hall is generally used for chamber music, recitals, concerts and cinema projection. Main hall and foyer are spaces for the audience to wander during breaks. They house painting, sculpture and photography exhibitions. Behind the scenes are a number of workshops, warehouses, rehearsal rooms, dressing rooms. There is also Poland's largest elevator for transporting decorations and set pieces. The Restaurant Maestra is located in the third circle of the building. Its interior is decorated with pictures from Opera Nova performances and a poster collection of the Bydgoszcz Opera Festival. =Surroundings= Opera Nova close neighborhood includes: * an observation deck connected to the bank of Brda river; * a footbridge joining Mill Island in Bydgoszcz, through which you can reach Venice of Bydgoszcz or the Old market (); * at the bottom of Opera Nova, a summer amphitheater for 200 people giving onto the river. In 2016, a stage will be built on the river from the quay. On April 19, 2013, to celebrate the 667th anniversary of the city charter, a modern sculpture of The archer has been unveiled in front of the opera house, called the \\"New Archer\\" (). =Conference Center= Congress Centre Opera Nova, occupying the third circle of the building, provides professional support for symposia, conferences, trade shows, conventions, exhibitions, anniversaries and performances of small theatrical plays. The Center houses two conference rooms (\\"Manru\\" and \\"Fidelio\\") for 300 and 220 people, five seminar rooms and a restaurant, \\"Maestro\\" with catering facilities. Both rooms are equipped with electrically folding stands, electro-acoustic and simultaneous translation boothes. In addition, equipment includes: * audio-visual capacities managed by touch panels * multimedia kiosks with Internet access * multimedia presentations capabilities. Combined use of the large Auditorium and the conference centre allow hosting very large gathering (up to 1,500 people). Musical ensembles =Soloists= Opera Nova company includes more than 50 solo singers: * 15 sopranos, * 8 mezzo-sopranos, * 15 tenors * 10 baritones, * 7 basses, along with actors, assistants, tutors and other staff personnel. Performance of Carmen in 2008 =Orchestra= From 1956 to 1963, 40 musicians from Bydgoszcz Pomeranian Philarmonic were playing for each opera performances. A professional Opera Nova orchestra has been established in 1963, comprising initially 36 musicians, in majority graduates from Bydgoszcz Music Academy - \\"Feliks Nowowiejski\\". Several conductors led this group: * Zbigniew Chwedczuk * Zdzislaw Wendy≈Ñski * Zygmunt Szczepanski * Zbigniew Droszcz * W≈Çodzimierz Ormicki * Joseph Klimanka * Stanis≈Çaw Renz * Adam Palka * Mieczyslaw Dondajewski * Jerzy Katlewicz * Mieczyslaw Nowakowski * Zygmunt Rychert * Boguslaw Madey * Vadim Perevoznikov * W≈Çodzimierz Szymanski * Jerzy Wo≈Çosiuk * Ruben Silva * Maciej Figas * Piotr Wajrak * Andrzej Straszy≈Ñski * Tadeusz Wojciechowski * Andrzej Knap Today, Opera Nova orchestra is 68 musicians strong, and its main conductor is the director of the Opera, Maciej Figas. Its yearly repertoire includes 32 pieces, mainly operas, operettas, ballets, oratorios, musicals from contemporary, popular and classical music. The orchestra always performs to accompany Opera Nova singers, as well as guest stars during galas in Poland and abroad. =Choir= The Opera Nova Choir was established in 1956, under the leadership of Antoni Rybka. Most of its members were recruited from the \\"Arion\\" choir in Bydgoszcz. Consecutive Choir directors of the Choir have been Czeslaw Kaczmarek (1982-1984), Maciej Banach (1991-1992) and Henryk Wierzcho≈Ñ (1984-1991 and since 1993). Over the years the choir mastered most of the works of world literature, opera, operetta, musicals and oratorios. Currently, choir band reaches approximately 80 people. Choir is augmented to stage performances of musical works with symphony orchestras: Pomeranian Philharmonic (for Bydgoszcz Music Festival), Koszalin Philharmonic and foreign. It is also involved in tours. =Ballet= Opera Nova Ballet was founded in 1956, initially with 40 dancers, in majority graduated students from Bydgoszcz ballet music center. Between 1959 and 1989, the ballet ensemble had a training room in the Chamber Theatre, then in the Pomeranian Arts House. Since the 1990s, the ballet working room is located in the building of the Opera Nova. Ballet repertoire includes around 30 works. Since its creation, the ballet premiered 6 times in Poland for The Nutcracker (1958), The King of the winds () by Feliks Nowowiejski (1963), Legend of love () by Melikov (1967), The Tale of the Stone Flower () by Sergei Prokofiev (1970), Anna Karenina by Rodion Shchedrin (1979) and a world premiere, the fairy tale ballet Puss in boots by Bogdan Pawlowski (1997). In 2011, ballet company was about 50 people strong, led by Ilona Ja≈õwin-Madejska. From 1995, with the creation of the Opera Nova Ballet Studio, children and youth groups follow shortened course ballet school. Some of their members are involved in performances of ballet and musicals. Bydgoszcz Opera Festival Poster of the 1st edition of Bydgoszcz Opera Festival =History= Bydgoszcz Opera Festival was born in 1994, associated with the difficulties to achieve the project of the Opera Nova building started in 1973. From 17 to 30 April 1994, the best troupes of Polish opera performed on the unfinished opera stage - Poznan, Lodz and Warsaw, Warsaw Chamber Opera, but also Askold Makarov Theatre Ballet of Saint Petersburg. All sessions were held in a harsh scenery of bare walls, and the audience was set in 500 wooden chairs borrowed from the military. The numerous audience which came to this unusual event rewarded the artists and the direction, creating a sublime festival. The almost eerie musical environment became one of the main strength of the event. It received a positive welcome from the artists and the audience, and provided a nationwide publicity for Bydgoszcz opera stage. The festival had reached its main goal: to stop a 20-year long procrastination in the construction of the opera house. The success of subsequent editions exceeded organizers' expectations: tickets were sold out long before the first day. With such possibilities, added to the new scene of Bydgoszcz opera house, it was possible to create large-scale performances of opera and ballet. For instance: * Giuseppe Verdi's Macbeth performed by company from the Warsaw Grand Theatre (2nd edition, 1995); * Giuseppe Verdi's La forza del destino presented by the Grand Theatre of Pozna≈Ñ (8th edition, 2001); * Modest Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov performed by the National Opera of Kiev (3rd edition, 1996); * Turandot by Giacomo Puccini, presented by Opera Nova troupe at the opening of the 3rd edition (1996). For the first time in Bydgoszcz were presented the following ballets: * Aram Khachaturian's Spartacus performed by the Grand Academic Ballet Theatre of Belarus in Belarus Minsk (2nd edition, 1995); * Prokofiev's Cinderella executed by the Royal ballet of Antwerp (6th edition, 1999); * L√©o Delibes's Copp√©lia performed by the Latvian National Opera in Riga (7th edition, 2000). Through the Festival occurrences, other famous companies performed: troupe from Chicago (7th edition, 2000) or the Cullberg Ballet from Sweden which executed a modern choreography of the Sleeping Beauty (7th edition, 2001). =Characteristics= Opera Festival Bydgoszcz is the biggest Polish review of diverse musical genres in the area of opera, operetta, musical and ballet, both classic and modern. Various opera companies present here their latest artistic achievements. It is a tradition to invite, in addition to the main Polish troupes, at least one company from abroad. The troupe from the Opera Nova, at the inauguration of each festival always premieres. The festival is held annually in the spring season: April or May. For the 2016 edition, the Opera Nova premiered Don Carlos. Polish scenes invited to perform are ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Grand Theatre, Wroc≈Çaw Opera, the ballet School of Poznan, Polish National Ballet. Foreign guests are the Czech National Theatre in Brno and the Chinese Shanghai Ballet Company. The festival is funded by the Marshal Office of Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, the city of Bydgoszcz, the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage and private sponsors. The festival is accompanied by exhibitions, a review of music videos on DVD and an Opera Youth Forum, as a review of chamber operas performed by students of Polish and foreign music academies. Miscellaneous * Bydgoszcz prima donna were, among others: Lidia Skowron (1960s and 1970s), Barbara Zag√≥rzanka and Barbara Nitecka (1980s), Katarzyna Rymarczyk and Magdalena Krzy≈Ñska. * During Polish People's Republic, the most successful turnout at Opera Nova has been musicals: Winged lover and Thank you, Eve in the second half of the 1970s. * Until 1976, bass-baritone soloist [Bronis≈Çaw Pekowski, was chief director of the Regional Geodesy and Cartography Company while staging at the Opera Nova. * Opera Nova soloists have been invited abroad, including Georgia, Russia, Romania, Hungary, Japan, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Germany and former Soviet Republics. * Since 1989, the opera company has been holding an annual tour abroad to perform operas, ballets and operettas: * Italy and Malta in 1989 (Rigoletto, Otello, Madama Butterfly); * Netherlands in 1990; * Belgium in 1992.

Early life and teaching career Hudson was born in 1828 in Brompton, London, third of five sons of John Corrie Hudson, chief clerk of the Legacy Duty Office, and wife Emily. His father in youth was an advanced radical and friend of William Godwin, of the Shelleys, Charles Lamb and William Hazlitt. He was educated at Kensington Grammar School and The Grange, Sunderland. He was musical, and as a young man wrote and composed songs. Family circumstances compelled him to earn his living by teaching at an early age, in Glasgow and later at the Liverpool Royal Institution. In 1848 he went to St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1852, proceeding M.A. in 1855 and LL.D. in 1866. After leaving Cambridge he became on 25 July 1852 second master of Bristol Grammar School, and on 30 March 1855 he was appointed headmaster. He resigned this post at midsummer 1860, and in 1861 opened a private school at Manilla Hall, Clifton, Bristol, formerly the residence of Sir William Draper, which he conducted until 1881. Hudson's varied interests and sympathies made the school successful. Afterwards he lived at 6 Royal York Crescent, Clifton; in 1891 he moved to Dawlish, Devon, and in 1899 to Shanklin, Isle of Wight. During his later years he often gave lectures, chiefly at public schools, on natural history, which he illustrated with coloured transparencies of his own construction. Microscopical research Hudson devoted his leisure to microscopical research, and in particular to the study of the Rotifera. His first printed paper was on Rhinops Vitrea in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History for 1869. Afterwards he published numerous papers in the Microscopical Journal and the Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, describing new genera and species of Rotifera, of which Pedahon mirum was a notable discovery. A list of these papers is given in the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society for 1904, page 49. He was elected fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society in 1872; he was president of the society from 1888 to 1890, and an honorary fellow from 1901 until his death. With Philip Henry Gosse he published in 1886‚Äì7 The Rotifera: or Wheel-Animalcules. In recognition of this, the standard monograph on the subject, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1889. Lord Avebury (Pleasures of Life, ch. 9) quotes the charming introduction of this work as showing that the true naturalist was no mere dry collector. Hudson's natural gift for drawing found expression in the illustrations of The Rotifera. Hudson died in Shanklin on 23 October 1903, and was buried there. He married on 19 June 1855 Mary Ann Tibbits, and they had one daughter, Florence; his second marriage on 24 June 1858, at Clifton, was to Louisa Maria Fiott Hammond, and they had four sons and five daughters.  The Hudson Transparencies  The Hudson Transparencies are a collection of 58 large framed manila paper screens made by Hudson, circa 1880s, as teaching aids. Shapes were cut out of the manila paper and decorated with tissue paper, which was painted with watercolour designs. When the transparencies are backlit, striking images of microscopic organisms become apparent. The Hudson Transparencies are held in the University of Exeter Special Collections Department, reference number EUL MS 442. A study of the transparencies was carried out in 2011 by Robin Wootton for an article in the Report and Transactions of the Devonshire Association 143, where the transparencies were catalogued for the first time and twenty illustrated.

This is a concern because companies with privacy policies, health care providers, and financial institutions may release the data they collect after the data has gone through the de-identification process. The de- identification process involves masking, generalizing or deleting both direct and indirect identifiers; the definition of this process is not universal, however. Information in the public domain, even seemingly anonymized, may thus be re-identified in combination with other pieces of available data and basic computer science techniques. The Protection of Human Subjects ('Common Rule#Signatories'), a collection of multiple U.S. federal agencies and departments including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, speculate that re-identification is becoming gradually easier because of \\"big data\\"‚Äîthe abundance and constant collection and analysis of information along the evolution of technologies and the advances of algorithms. However, others have claimed that de-identification is a safe and effective data liberation tool and do not view re-identification as a concern. More and more data are becoming publicly available over the Internet. These data are released after applying some anonymization techniques like removing personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses and social security numbers to ensure the sources' privacy. This assurance of privacy allows the government to legally share limited data sets with third parties without requiring written permission. Such data has proved to be very valuable for researchers, particularly in health care. A 2000 study found that 87 percent of the U.S. population can be identified using a combination of their gender, birthdate and zip code. Others do not think that re-identification is a serious threat, and call it a \\"myth\\"; they claim that the combination of zip code, date of birth and gender is rare or partially complete, such as only the year and month birth without the date, or the county name instead of the specific zip code, thus the risk of such re-identification is reduced in many instances. This examples of unauthorized re-identification did not require access to separately kept ‚Äúadditional information‚Äù that was under the control of the data controller as is now required for GDPR compliant pseudonymisation. The risk of re-identification is significantly reduced with GDPR-compliant pseudonymization which requires that data cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of separately kept \\"additional information.‚Äù GDPR compliant pseudonymized data embodies the state of the art in Data Protection by Design and by Default because it requires protection of both direct and indirect identifiers (not just direct). GDPR Data Protection by Design and by Default principles as embodied in pseudonymization require protection of both direct and indirect identifiers so that personal data is not cross- referenceable (or re-identifiable) via the Mosaic Effect without access to ‚Äúadditional information‚Äù that is kept separately by the controller. Because access to separately kept ‚Äúadditional information‚Äù is required for re- identification, attribution of data to a specific data subject can be limited by the controller to support lawful purposes only.  Legal protections of data in the United States  Existing privacy regulations typically protect information that has been modified, so that the data is deemed anonymized, or de-identified. For financial information, the Federal Trade Commission permits its circulation if it is de-identified and aggregated. The Gramm Leach Bliley Act (GLBA), which mandates financial institutions give consumers the opportunity to opt out of having their information shared with third parties, does not cover de-identified data if the information is aggregate and does not contain personal identifiers, since this data is not treated as personally identifiable information. = Educational records = In terms of university records, authorities both on the state and federal level have shown an awareness about issues of privacy in education and a distaste for institutions' disclosure of information. The U.S. Department of Education has provided guidance about data discourse and identification, instructing educational institutions to be sensitive to the risk of re-identification of anonymous data by cross-referencing with auxiliary data, to minimize the amount of data in the public domain by decreasing publication of directory information about students and institutional personnel, and to be consistent in the processes of de-identification. = Medical records = Medical information of patients are becoming increasingly available on the Internet, on free and publicly accessing platforms such as HealthData.gov and PatientsLikeMe, encouraged by government open data policies and data sharing initiatives spearheaded by the private sector. While this level of accessibility yields many benefits, concerns regarding discrimination and privacy have been raised. Protections on medical records and consumer data from pharmacies are stronger compared to those for other kinds of consumer data. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) protects the privacy of identifiable data about health, but authorize information release to third parties if de-identified. In addition, it mandates that patients receive breach notifications should there be more than a low probability that the patient's information was inappropriately disclosed or utilized without sufficient mitigation of the harm to him or her. The likelihood of re-identification is a factor in determining the probability that the patient's information has been compromised. Commonly, pharmacies sell de-identified information to data mining companies that sell to pharmaceutical companies in turn. There have been state laws enacted to ban data mining of medical information, but they were struck down by federal courts in Maine and New Hampshire on First Amendment grounds. Another federal court on another case used \\"illusive\\" to describe concerns about privacy of patients and did not recognize the risks of re-identification. = Biospecimen = The Notice of Proposed Rule Making, published by the Common Rule Agencies in September 2015, expanded the umbrella term of \\"human subject\\" in research to include biospecimens, or materials taken from the human body - blood, urine, tissue etc. This mandates that researchers using biospecimens must follow the stricter requirements of doing research with human subjects. The rationale for this is the increased risk of re-identification of biospecimen. The final revisions affirmed this regulation.24 C.F.R. ¬ß .104 2017.  Re-identification efforts  There have been a sizable amount of successful attempts of re- identification in different fields. Even if it is not easy for a lay person to break anonymity, once the steps to do so are disclosed and learnt, there is no need for higher level knowledge to access information in a database. Sometimes, technical expertise is not even needed if a population has a unique combination of identifiers. = Health records = In the mid 1990s, a government agency in Massachusetts called Group Insurance Commission (GIC), which purchased health insurance for employees of the state, decided to release records of hospital visits to any researcher who requested the data, at no cost. GIC assured that the patient's privacy was not a concern since it had removed identifiers such as name, addresses, social security numbers. However, information such as zip codes, birth date and sex remained untouched. The GIC assurance was reinforced by the then governor of Massachusetts, William Weld. Latanya Sweeney, a graduate student at the time, put her mind to picking out the governor's records in the GIC data. By combining the GIC data with the voter database of the city Cambridge, which she purchased for 20 dollars, Governor Weld's record was discovered with ease. In 1997, a researcher successfully de-anonymized medical records using voter databases. In 2001, Professor Latanya Sweeney again successfully matched anonymized hospital visit records in the state of Washington to individual persons using the state's voting records 43% of the time.Sweeney L. Only You, Your Doctor and Many Others May Know. Technology Science. 2015092903. September 25, 2015. There are existing algorithms used to re-identify patient with prescription drug information. = Consumer habits and practices = Two researchers at the University of Texas, Arvind Narayanan and Professor Vitaly Shmatikov, were able to re-identity some portion of anonymized Netflix movie-ranking data with individual consumers on the streaming website. The data was released by Netflix 2006 after de-identification, which consisted of replacing individual names with random numbers and moving around personal details. The two researchers de-anonymized some of the data by comparing it with non-anonymous IMDb (Internet Movie Database) users‚Äô movie ratings. Very little information from the database, it was found, was needed to identify the subscriber. In the resulting research paper, there were startling revelations of how easy it is to re-identify Netflix users. For example, simply knowing data about only two movies a user has reviewed, including the precise rating and the date of rating give or take three days allows for 68% re-identification success. In 2006, after AOL published its users' search queries, data that was anonymized prior to the public release, New York Times reporters successfully carried out re-identification of individuals by taking groups of searches made by anonymized users. AOL had attempted to suppress identifying information, including usernames and IP addresses, but had replaced these with unique identification numbers to preserve the utility of this data for researchers. Bloggers, after the release, pored over the data, either trying to identify specific users with this content, or to point out entertaining, depressing, or shocking search queries, examples of which include \\"how to kill you wife,\\" \\"depression and medical leave,\\" \\"car crash photos.\\" Two reporters, Michael Barbaro and Tom Zeller, were able to track down a 62 year old widow named Thelma Arnold from recognizing clues to the identity of User 417729 search histories. Arnold acknowledged that she was the author of the searches, confirming that re-identification is possible. = Location data = Location data - series of geographical positions in time that describe a person's whereabouts and movements - is a class of personal data that is specifically hard to keep anonymous. Location shows recurring visits to frequently attended places of everyday life such as home, workplace, shopping, healthcare or specific sparetime patterns. Only removing a person's identity from location data will not remove identifiable patterns such as commuting rhythms, sleeping places, or work places. By mapping coordinates onto addresses, location data is easily re-identified or correlated with a person's private life contexts. Streams of location information play an important role in the reconstruction of personal identifiers from smartphone data accessed by apps. = Court decisions = In 2019, Professor Kerstin No√´lle Vokinger and Dr. Urs Jakob M√ºhlematter, two researchers at the University of Zurich, analyzed cases of the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland to assess which pharmaceutical companies and which medical drugs were involved in legal actions against the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) regarding pricing decisions of medical drugs. In general, involved private parties (such as pharmaceutical companies) and information that would reveal the private party (for example, drug names) are anonymized in Swiss judgments. The researchers were able to re-identify 84% of the relevant anonymized cases of the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland by linking information from publicly accessible databases. This achievement was covered by the media and started a debate if and how court cases should be anonymized.  Consequences  The individuals whose data is re-identified is also at risk of having their information, with their identity attached it, sold to organizations they do not want possessing private information about their finances, health or preferences. The release of this data may cause anxiety, shame or embarrassment. Once an individual's privacy has been breached as a result of re-identification, future breaches become much easier: once an link is made between one piece of data and a person's real identity, any association between the data and an anonymous identity breaks anonymity of the person. Re-identification may expose companies which have pledged to assure anonymity to increased liability to contract or to tort and cause them to violate their privacy policies by having released information to third parties that can identify users after re-identification. Not only will they violate internal policies, institutions may also violate state and federal laws, such laws concerning financial confidentiality or medical privacy.  Remedies  To address the risks of re-identification, several proposals have been suggested: * Higher standards and uniform definition of de-identification while retaining data utility: the definition of de-identification should balance privacy protections to reduce re- identification risk with the refusal of companies to delete data Lagos, Yianni. 2014. \\"Symposium: Taking the Personal Out of Data: Making Sense of De- identification.\\" Indiana Law Review.

There are, however, ways for lawmakers to combat and punish re-identification efforts, if and when they are exposed: pair a ban with harsher penalties and stronger enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation; grant victims of re- identification a right of action against those who re-identify them; and mandate software audit trails for people who utilize and analyze anonymized data. A small-scale re-identification ban may also be imposed on trusted recipients of particular databases, such as government data miners or researchers. This ban would be much easier to enforce and may discourage re- identification. Examples of de-anonymization *\\"Researchers at MIT and the Universit√© catholique de Louvain, in Belgium, analyzed data on 1.5 million cellphone users in a small European country over a span of 15 months and found that just four points of reference, with fairly low spatial and temporal resolution, was enough to uniquely identify 95 percent of them. In other words, to extract the complete location information for a single person from an ‚Äúanonymized‚Äù data set of more than a million people, all you would need to do is place him or her within a couple of hundred yards of a cellphone transmitter, sometime over the course of an hour, four times in one year. A few Twitter posts would probably provide all the information you needed, if they contained specific information about the person's whereabouts.\\" *\\"Sharing sequencing data short tandem repeats on the Y chromosome and querying recreational genetic genealogy databases.
