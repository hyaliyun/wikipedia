It may be composed of fine, hydrophilic hypha which branches frequently to explore and exploit the soil matrix or may aggregate to form rhizomorphs; highly differentiated, hydrophobic, enduring, transport structures.  Characteristics  Ectomycorrhizas on Picea glauca roots surrounded by extramatrical mycelium = Overview = Apart from mycorrhizas, extramatrical mycelium is the primary vegetative body of ectomycorrhizal fungi. It is the location of mineral acquisition, enzyme production, and a key means of colonizing new root tips. Extramatrical mycelium facilitates the movement of carbon into the rhizosphere, moves carbon and nutrients between hosts and is an important food source for invertebrates. = Exploration type = The mycelial growth pattern, extent of biomass accumulation, and the presence or absence of rhizomorphs are used to classify fungi by exploration type. Agerer first proposed the designation of exploration types in 2001, and the concept has since been widely employed in studies of ectomycorrhizal ecology. Four exploration types are commonly recognized: Contact, Short-distance, Medium- distance and Long-distance. Contact exploration types possess a predominantly smooth mantle and lack rhizomorphs with ectomycorrhizas in close contact with the surrounding substrate. Short-distance exploration types also lack rhizomorphs but the mantle is surrounded by frequent projections of hyphae, which emanate a short distance into the surrounding substrate. Most ectomycorrhizal ascomycetes are included in this group. Medium-distance exploration types are further divided into three subtypes defined by the growth range and differentiation of its rhizomorphs. Medium-distance Fringe form interconnected hyphal networks with rhizomorphs that divide and fuse repeatedly. Medium-distance Mat types form dense hyphal mats which aggregate into a homogeneous mass. Finally, the Medium-distance Smooth sub-type has rhizomorphs with smooth mantles and margins. Fungal Hyphae Cells 1- Hyphal wall 2- Septum 3- Mitochondrion 4- Vacuole 5- Ergosterol crystal 6- Ribosome 7- Nucleus 8- Endoplasmic reticulum 9- Lipid body 10- Plasma membrane 11- Spitzenk√∂rper/growth tip and vesicles 12- Golgi apparatus Long-distance exploration types are highly differentiated, forming rhizomorphs that contain hollow vessel-like transport tubes. Long distance types are associated with increased levels of organic nitrogen uptake compared to other exploration types and are thought to be less competitive in disturbed systems in contrast to short distance types which are able to regenerate more efficiently after a disturbance event. Exploration type is primarily consistent within a given lineage. However, some fungal genera which contain a large number of species have a great diversity of extramatrical hyphal morphology and are known to contain more than one exploration type. Because of this, extrapolating exploration type to species known only by lineage is difficult. Often, Fungi fail to fit into a defined exploration type, falling instead along a gradient. Exploration type also fails to take into account other aspects of hyphal morphology, such as the extent to which hyphae cross into deeper soil horizons. Field studies have shown that extramatrical mycelium is more likely to proliferate in mineral soils than in organic material, and may be particularly absent in fresh leaf litter. However, the presence of different ectomycorrhizal groups in different soil horizons suggest that different groups have evolved specialized niche separation, possibly attributable to exploration type.  Ecological implications  = Community assembly = Ectomycorrhizal Laccaria fruit bodies in forest community Because ectomycorrhizas are small and possess a limited contact area with the surrounding soil, the presence of extramatrical hyphae significantly increases the surface area in contact with the surrounding environment. Increased surface area means greater access to necessary nutrient sources. Additionally, the presence of rhizomorphs or mycelial cords, can act comparably to xylem tissue in plants, where hollow tubes of vessel hyphae shuttle water and solubilized nutrients over long distances. The abundance and spatial distribution of host root tips in the rhizosphere is an important factor mediating ectomycorrhizal community assembly. Root density may select for the exploration types best suited for a given root spacing. In Pine systems, Fungi that display short-distance exploration types are less able to colonize new roots spaced far from the mycorrhiza, and long-distance types dominate areas of low root density. Conversely, short-distance exploration types tend to dominate areas of high root density where decreased carbon expenditure makes them more competitive than long-distance species. The growth of extramatrical mycelium has a direct effect on the mutualistic nutrient trading between ectomycorrhizal fungi and their hosts. Increased hyphal occupation of the soil allows the fungus to take greater advantage of water and nutrients otherwise inaccessible to plant roots and to more efficiently transport these resources back to the plant. Conversely, the increased costs in carbon allocation associated with supporting a fungal partner with an extensive mycelial system presents a number of questions related to the costs and benefits of ectomycorrhizal mutualism. = Carbon cycling = Although there is evidence that certain species of mycorrhizal fungi may obtain at least a portion of their carbon via saprotrophic nutrition, the bulk of mycorrhizal carbon acquisition happens by way of trading for host-derived photosynthetic products. Mycorrhizal systems represent a major carbon sink. Laboratory studies predict that around 23% of plant-derived carbon is allocated to extrametrical mycelium, although an estimated 15-30% of this is lost to fungal respiration. Carbon allocation is distributed unequally to extramatrical mycelium depending on fungal taxa, nutrient availability, and the age of the associated mycorrhizas. Much of the carbon allocated to extramatrical mycelium accumulates as fungal biomass, making up an estimated one-third of the total microbial biomass and one-half of the total dissolved organic carbon in some forest soils. Carbon also supports the production of sporocarps and sclerotia, with various taxa investing differentially in these structures rather than in the proliferation of extramatrical mycelium. Carbon acquisition also goes toward the production of fungal exudates. Extramatrical hyphae excrete a range of compounds into the soil matrix, accounting for as much as 40% of total carbon usage. These exudates are released primarily at the growing front, and are used in functions such as mineralization and homeostasis. Many researchers have attempted projections of the role that extramatrical mycelium may play in carbon sequestration. Although estimates of the life span of individual ectomycorrhizas very considerably, turnover is generally considered on a scale of months. Cortinarius ectomycorrhizas and extramatrical mycelium on Pseudotsuga menziesii rootsAfter death, the presence ectomycorrhizas on root tips, may increase the rate of root decomposition for some fungal taxa. Besides host plant death and mycorrhizal turnover, rates of carbon sequestration may also be affected by disturbances in the soil, which cause sections of the extramatrical mycelium to become severed from the host plant. Such disturbances, such as those caused by animal disruption, mycophagous invertebrates or habitat destruction, may have a notable impact on turnover rates. These variables make it difficult to estimate the turnover rates of mycorrhizal biomass in forest soils and the relative contribution of extramatrical mycelium to carbon sequestration. = Mycelial networks = The presence of long-distance extramatrical hyphae may affect forest health via the formation of common mycelial networks, in which hyphal connections form between plant hosts and can facilitate the transfer of carbon and nutrients between hosts. Mycelial networks may also be responsible for facilitating the transport of allelopathic chemicals from the supplying plant directly to the rhizosphere of other plants. Ectomycorrhizal fungi increase primary production in host plants, with multi trophic effects. In this way, extramatrical mycelium is important to the maintenance of soil food webs, supplying a significant nutritive source to invertebrates and microorganisms.  Mineral access  = Enzyme production = The enzymatic activities of ectomycorrhizal fungi are highly variable between species. These differences are correlated with exploration type (particularly the presence or absence of rhizomorphs) rather than lineage or host association- suggesting that similar morphologies of extraradical mycelium are an example of convergent evolution. Differences in enzymatic activity, and hence the ability to degrade organic compounds dictate fungal nutrient access, with wide-ranging ecological implications. = Phosphorus = Because diverse ectomycorrhizal fungal taxa differ greatly in their metabolic activity they also often differ in their capacity to trade nutrients with their hosts. Phosphorus acquisition by mycorrhizal fungi, and the subsequent transfer to plant hosts, is thought to be one of the main functions of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. Extramatrical mycelium is the site of collection for phosphorus within the soil system. This relationship is so strong that starving host plants of phosphorus is known to increase the growth of extramatrical mycelium tenfold. = Nitrogen = Recently, Isotopic studies have been used to investigate relative trading between ectomycorrhizal fungi and plant hosts and to assess the relative importance of exploration type on nutrient trading ability. 15N values are elevated in ectomycorrhizal Fungi and depleted in fungal hosts, as a result of nutrient trading. Fungal species with exploration types producing greater amounts of extraradical mycelium are known to accumulate greater amounts 15N in both root tips and fruit bodies, a phenomenon partially attributed to higher levels of N cycling within these species.  Assessment methods  Amanita phalloides mycelium Determining the longevity of extramatrical mycelium is difficult, and estimates range from just a few months to several years. Turnover rates are assessed in a variety of ways including direct observation and 14C dating. Such estimates are an important variable in calculating the contribution that ectomycorrhizal fungi have to carbon sequestration. In order to differentiate ectomycorrhizal mycelium from the mycelium of saprotrophic fungi, biomass estimates are often done by ergosterol or phospholipid fatty acid analysis, or by using sand-filled bags, which are likely to be avoided by saprotrophic fungi because they lack organic matter. Detailed morphological characterization of exploration type has been defined for over 550 different ectomycorrhizal species and are compiled in www. deemy. de. Due to the difficulty in classifying exploration types of intermediate forms, other metrics have been proposed to qualify and quantify the growth of extramatrical mycelium, including Specific Actual/Potential Mycelium Space Occupation and Specific Extramatrical Mycelial Length which attempt to account for the contributions of mycelial density, surface area and total biomass.

During the next few years, he made several important photographic trips through the wilderness areas of the Sierra Nevada. In 1921, Willard married Beatrice Armstrong, and after a year of traveling and photographing the deserts of the Southwest, they settled permanently in Palm Springs and opened a studio and gallery. For the next twenty-five years he traveled throughout the Colorado and Mojave Deserts and developed a passion for photographing the desert. To escape the summer heat, he and his wife established a second gallery in Mammoth Lakes and seasonally worked in both locations photographing the mountains in the summer and the desert in the winter.

Produced by Toei Animation and directed by Munehisa Sakai (Seasons 1 and 2) and Chiaki Kon (Season 3), the series was streamed worldwide on Niconico from July 5, 2014 to July 18, 2015. Season 1 and 2's episodes were released twice a month. Instead of remaking the 1992‚Äì97 anime series preceding it, Toei produced Crystal as a reboot of Sailor Moon and as a more faithful adaptation of the original manga by omitting much of the original material from the first series. The story focuses on Usagi Tsukino, who is a young girl that obtains the power to become the titular character. Other Sailor Guardians join her in the search for Princess Serenity and the Silver Crystal. The first episode had an advanced screening on June 30, 2014 to celebrate Usagi's birthday. In May 2014, Viz Media licensed Crystal for an English-language release in North America, simulcasting the series on Neon Alley and Hulu to coincide with the worldwide streaming. Crunchyroll also simulcast the series in a separate contract with Toei Animation. Viz premiered the first episode as part of their \\"Sailor Moon Day\\" celebration at the Anime Expo Convention in Los Angeles. A third season, based on the Infinity arc of the manga (renamed Death Busters in this adaptation), premiered on April 4, 2016 and concluded on June 27, 2016. A sequel project was announced on January 25, 2017, later confirmed to be a two-part theatrical anime film project adapting the Dream arc from the manga (Dead Moon in this adaptation). On June 30, 2019, it was announced that the title of the two-part film will be Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal, with the first film originally scheduled to be released in Japan on September 11, 2020, but was postponed to January 8, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The second film will be released on February 11, 2021. Plot =Dark Kingdom= Usagi Tsukino, a 14-year-old middle school student, meets Luna, a talking black cat that tells her that she is Sailor Moon, a Sailor Guardian destined to fight a group of villains called the Dark Kingdom. Luna also instructs Sailor Moon to find her fellow Sailor Guardians, the princess of an ancestral kingdom on the Moon, and a legendary artifact known as the Silver Crystal. On her journey, Sailor Moon meets her fellow Guardians Sailor Mercury (Ami Mizuno), Sailor Mars (Rei Hino), Sailor Jupiter (Makoto Kino), Sailor Venus (Minako Aino), and a mysterious masked man called Tuxedo Mask (Mamoru Chiba), to whom Usagi is attracted. Later, Usagi and the Sailor Guardians discover that in their previous lives they were members of an ancient Moon Kingdom in a period of time called the Silver Millennium. The Dark Kingdom waged war against them, resulting in the destruction of the Moon Kingdom. It turns out that Sailor Moon herself is Princess Serenity, the Princess of the Moon Kingdom, and that she alone has the power to make the Silver Crystal appear and to use its incredible power. Meanwhile, Tuxedo Mask is revealed to be Prince Endymion, the first crown prince of the Earth and Serenity's lover in his previous life. After defeating the Four Kings of Heaven (who turn out to be Endymion's loyal knights in the past) and killing their leader Queen Beryl, the Sailor Guardians confront a brainwashed Endymion and the ruler of the Dark Kingdom ‚Äî Queen Metaria. To prevent Metaria from spreading darkness all over the Earth, the Guardians sacrifice their lives. Using the power of the Silver Crystal, Sailor Moon destroys Metaria and resurrects her friends. =Black Moon= After Sailor Moon restores the Earth to normal and prepares to live a normal life again with Mamoru and her friends, a little girl falls from the sky, claiming to have the same name as Usagi, but nicknamed as \\"Chibiusa\\" by Usagi and the others. A group of villains called the Black Moon Clan, led by Prince Demande, initiate a series of operations while looking for Chibiusa and the Silver Crystal. Chibiusa is revealed to be Sailor Moon's and Tuxedo Mask's daughter from a distant future that has been decimated by the Clan, and is searching for Sailor Moon and the Silver Crystal in order to save her mother. Sailor Moon and her friends accompany Chibiusa to the future, and they meet the Guardian of Time and Chibiusa's friend, Sailor Pluto. Chibiusa is manipulated by Demande's advisor and the true mastermind of the Clan, Death Phantom, and transforms into Black Lady. Demande manages to obtain the Silver Crystals of the past and the future and is about to bring them together when Sailor Pluto stops time to prevent the universe from being destroyed by this act, leading to her own death. Black Lady is shocked to see her friend die and reverts to her true self, transforming into Sailor Chibi Moon. While Demande dies protecting Sailor Moon from Death Phantom, the latter is destroyed by the combined powers of Sailor Moon and the awakened Sailor Chibi Moon. =Death Busters= After students from the prestigious Mugen Academy become victims of a group of villains called the Death Busters, who transform them into Daimons, Usagi and their friends meet two Mugen Academy students: car racer Haruka Tenoh and violinist Michiru Kaioh. Haruka and Michiru are the civilian identities of two new Sailor Guardians: Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, who are initially reluctant to work with Sailor Moon and the others. Chibiusa befriends a mysterious girl named Hotaru Tomoe, daughter of Mugen Academy founder Professor Tomoe, who is later revealed to be a key figure of the Death Busters. Sailor Pluto is reincarnated as university student Setsuna Meioh, and she joins Sailors Uranus and Neptune. Using the power of all the Sailor Guardians, Usagi gains a new transformation: Super Sailor Moon. The Sailor Guardians learn that Hotaru's body is host to Mistress 9, partner of the leader of the Death Busters, Master Pharaoh 90. At the same time, Hotaru is also the reincarnation of the Guardian of Silence, Sailor Saturn, who has the power to destroy the whole world. For this reason, Sailors Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto fear Saturn's awakening. In the climatic battle, Pharaoh 90 begins to merge himself with the planet, but the newly awakened Sailor Saturn uses her power to send him back to his dimension, the Tau Star System, sacrificing herself in the process. As Neo-Queen Serenity, Usagi restores the city and resurrects everyone that was killed in the battle, including Hotaru, who is reborn as an infant. Haruka, Michiru, and Setsuna vow to be Hotaru's family and leave the city, with the promise to rejoin Usagi and her friends someday.

He is a former commander of the United States Seventh Fleet (from July 28, 1973 ‚Äì June 15, 1975) and Commander Naval Forces Korea. He was a 1944 graduate of the United States Naval Academy.  Operation Frequent Wind and VADM Steele  Early in 1975, ships deployments had been reduced and as a cost-saving measure, CTF 73 staff, Logistics Force Seventh Fleet, had moved into buildings ashore and now lacked the ability to provide an on-scene command presence afloat near the other fleet units congregating around Vung Tau. Things were happening too fast among the ships present on scene for us back in Sasebo to be able to keep up with events from such a remote location. RADM Johnson, our commander, rightly felt we needed someone on scene who could keep him current about was happening and thus improve his ability to logistically assist fleet needs. For that purpose, he decided to put together and activate a mobile mini-staff to fly to the area and take charge of our fleet units as on scene commander while at the same time reporting real-time activities back to the home staff. The plan was that I,then LCDR Barry N. Kaye, would act as the operations officer under our chief of staff, Capt Keller, who would assume on-scene command of our logistics assets. Seemed like a great idea, and we immediately set out to make it happen. Nevertheless, all of this was easier said than done. First, it involved a military aircraft ride down to the naval airbase at Cubi Point and then flying from Cubi to land onboard one of the carriers in the area via a COD aircraft. After that, we would have to hopscotch by boat and helo out to our eventual destination, our pre-designated command ship, the USS KAWISHIWI AO 146, a large but older fleet oiler, that was off station away from the immediate Vung Tau holding area refueling fleet units. Our first hop by helo was set up take us to the USS BLUE RIDGE, the amphibious command ship where the officer in tactical command of the operation was headquartered. Although the fleet flagship, USS OKLAHOMA CITY CG 5, was present, she did not have the best communications and command and control facilities such as NTDS (navy tactical data system) or the latest satellite communications systems just coming into fleet service. For that reason, VADM Steele, then COMSEVENTHFLT, had also flown over to BLUE RIDGE to observe what seemed to be the eminent evacuation of remaining American personnel from Saigon. He came without staff. I was very familiar with many of VADM Steele's officers and did not observe anyone I recognized. As a result, he depended upon support from the embarked BLUE RIDGE staff, RADM Whitmire who was Commander Amphibious Forces (CTF-76). Additionally, I'm not positive but I believe his flag remained in OKC the entire time and was not broken as would be normal for reason(s) I have never understood. Nevertheless, simply by his presence, he not only became the on- scene commander of all naval units present as COMSEVENTHFLT himself, he became directly involved with the conduct of the evacuation. Once aboard, he never left the command center, at least not while I was present. It seemed to me he was plainly commanding the entire operation. Meanwhile, RADM Whitmire and his Navy/Marine staff ran tactical operations in the background. How did I come to know this you might ask? Well, while Capt Keller and I waited for KAWISHIWI's return to our immediate area so we could transfer over to her, the balloon went up for all units to standby for implementation evacuation operations, and orders were given for the all units to focus entirely on the requirements leading up to the start of the mass departure of Americans ‚Äì Operation Frequent Wind. Capt Keller and I we were now stranded aboard BLUE RIDGE until further notice. As a well-known fellow staff officer to the amphibious task force (CTF 76) commander's staff, I was invited by one of my colleagues into the command center to observe the operation. As events started to unfold, both VADM Steele and RADM Whitmire were present in the command center and, as I stated earlier, it appeared to me that Steele had assumed overall command although using Whitmire and his staff as his own for consultation, issuing directions and personally communicating with higher authority about the situation as it developed. I mean no slight to Whitmire, but with Steele present, actively engaged with everyone deferring to him and Steele doing most of the talking and directing, there did not appear to be any question of who was in charge. Whitmire was clearly deferring to Steele on most issues. Whether he did it formally or not didn't seem important to anyone at the time, getting the operation underway was. Being in the command center allowed me to observe the first hours of the operation literally from a front-row seat. I was able to hear clearly VADM Steele's radio conversations with the embassy in Saigon, discussions with RADM Whitmire as well as deliberations with the various TF 76 coordinators present as the operation went forward. Several times, Steele had to move into an adjoining space to use a special communications link so he could speak directly with higher command, in all probability CINCPAC in Hawaii and possibly the Pentagon, I'm not sure which. Captain Keller and I continued to be stranded aboard BLUE RIDGE. But while in her command center, two unforgettable moments occurred. First, with the entire US SEVENTHFLT standing to seaward within sight of the coast line of Vung Tau harbor, American helicopter evacuation efforts began by the numerous Navy and Marine embarked aboard the assembled task force. The first major decision waypoint occurred as sunset approached on the first day of Eagle Pull when, under normal conditions, American helo operations should close down. These aircraft were normally restricted to VFR/daylight only operations. However, due to the huge numbers of people who desperately sought to depart Saigon, the command decision was made by Steele-Whitmire combo to allow flight operations continuously throughout the night until everything that could be done and everyone who could be evacuated, etc., had been accomplished. Flying through what was described via the helo control radio circuits as an intense lightning storm system, complicated by probable NVA anti-aircraft fire and flares illuminating the sky plus the limited instrumentation of those helos, the lack of night flying and landing experience by the pilots and the war-like conditions encountered around Saigon, this was a very difficult decision made by VADM Steele. But because of this action many, many people who would otherwise have been left behind were successfully evacuated. It goes without saying that the American pilots were nothing short of fantastic! Watching all this was a lesson in command decision-making that stayed with me for the remainder of my naval career. Sometimes you just have to take a risk if the situation warrants it, especially if involves the risk of life or death. ADMs Steele and Whitmire understood this and chose to save lives as possible. The second instance involved US Ambassador Martin who was still at the embassy in Saigon. VADM Steele had been in continuous direct voice radio contact with the embassy as well as higher command in Hawaii and Washington (he generally used a handset either directly in front of where I was seated or moved into a compartment just to my left where he spoke with higher authority on a secure long-range system). Various discussions were constantly being conducted up and down the chain of command between Marine and naval staff officers, but I concentrated on observing ADM Steele as he was in charge; I was on the 50-yard line with a front-row seat of this life-and-death event. Things came to a head towards the latter stages of the evacuation when word was received by the BLUE RIDGE's command center from the embassy in Saigon that the ambassador had instructed his staff that he would not leave until ‚Äúeveryone who wanted to be evacuated was taken out‚Äù or words to that effect. It took several moments for the message to sink in, but it was obvious from reports from our limited military force still on the ground around the embassy that this would be an impossible task, even under the most ideal circumstances. There were literally thousands, tens of thousands of Vietnamese and foreign nationals who desperately wanted to escape. The NVA was closing in quickly, and action to evacuate the ambassador and his staff had to be taken as soon as possible. After consulting with higher command and muttering a few choice words to no one in particular, Steele got on the radio and told the ambassador that he had come out as soon as possible under his own power or Steele would order the Marine guard that was still with him to forcibly put him aboard the next evacuation helicopter. Although I could not hear the response, there appeared to be some argument from Saigon, but finally the ambassador acceded to Steel's requirement and arrived on the BLUE RIDGE shortly thereafter. When we heard the ambassador was about to arrive, several officers, including myself, went down into flag officer country and stood in the passageway as his entourage streamed in along with what looked like his dependents, his pet dog and DOD emissary, Richard L. Armitage, close behind him. A moment I'll never forget. The embassy compound was taken by the NVA within hours after their arrival on the flagship, and the evacuation of Americans et al., for all intents and purposes, was finished. During the evacuation itself, I took several breaks from the command center and was able to observe and sometimes participate in pushing ARVN helicopters off the flight deck of BLUE RIDGE. Later that evening, the KAWISHIWI returned to the area and sent her boat over to pick Capt Keller's team up. Our mini-mobile team of two officers plus a yeoman had finally arrived at our intended destination but things had wound down and the operation as far as our part was concerned was just about over. Despite the fact that helo evacuation operations had come to an end, support of the evacuation operations were far from over, things simply shifted to the next phase ‚Äì getting the people who were now in our care to safe harbor became a priority. With Operation FREQUENT WIND complete, the fleet now shifted gears and Operation NEW LIFE commenced.

In combinatorial mathematics, a superpermutation on n symbols is a string that contains each permutation of n symbols as a substring. While trivial superpermutations can simply be made up of every permutation listed together, superpermutations can also be shorter (except for the trivial case of n = 1) because overlap is allowed. For instance, in the case of n = 2, the superpermutation 1221 contains all possible permutations (12 and 21), but the shorter string 121 also contains both permutations. It has been shown that for 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 5, the smallest superpermutation on n symbols has length 1! + 2! + ‚Ä¶ + n! . The first four smallest superpermutations have respective lengths 1, 3, 9, and 33, forming the strings 1, 121, 123121321, and 123412314231243121342132413214321. However, for n = 5, there are several smallest superpermutations having the length 153. One such superpermutation is shown below, while another of the same length can be obtained by switching all of the fours and fives in the second half of the string (after the bold 2): 12345123415234125341235412314523142531423514231542312453124351243152431254312 1345213425134215342135421324513241532413524132541321453214352143251432154321 For the cases of n > 5, a smallest superpermutation has not yet been proved nor a pattern to find them, but lower and upper bounds for them have been found.  Finding superpermutations  A diagram of the creation of a superpermutation with 3 symbols from a superpermutation with 2 symbols. One of the most common algorithms for creating a superpermutation of order n is a recursive algorithm. First, the superpermutation of order n-1 is split into its individual permutations in the order of how they appeared in the superpermutation. Each of those permutation are then placed next to a copy of themselves with an nth symbol added in between the two copies. Finally, each resulting structure is placed next to each other and all adjacent identical symbols are merged. For example, a superpermutation of order 3 can be created from one with 2 symbols; starting with the superpermutation 121 and splitting it up into the permutations 12 and 21, the permutations are copied and placed as 12312 and 21321. They are placed together to create 1231221321, and the identical adjacent 2s in the middle are merged to create 123121321, which is indeed a superpermutation of order 3. This algorithm results in the shortest possible superpermutation for all n less than or equal to 5, but becomes increasingly longer than the shortest possible as n increase beyond that. Another way of finding superpermutations lies in creating a graph where each permutation is a vertex and every permutation is connected by an edge. Each edge has a weight associated with it; the weight is calculated by seeing how many characters can be added to the end of one permutation (dropping the same number of characters from the start) to result in the other permutation. For instance, the edge from 123 to 312 has weight 2 because 123 + 12 = 12312 = 312. Any hamiltonian path through the created graph is a superpermutation, and the problem of finding the path with the smallest weight becomes a form of the traveling salesman problem. The first instance of a superpermutation smaller than length 1! + 2! + \\\\ldots + n! was found using a computer search on this method by Robin Houston.  Lower and upper bounds  An algorithm for finding the smallest superpermutation for 6 or more symbols is as of yet unsolved. However, several proofs have gradually shrunk the strong upper and lower bounds of the problem over time. = Lower bounds, or the Haruhi problem = In September 2011, an anonymous poster on the Science & Math (\\"/sci/\\") board of 4chan proved that the smallest superpermutation on n symbols (n ‚â• 2) has at least length n! + (n‚àí1)! + (n‚àí2)! + n ‚àí 3. In reference to the Japanese anime series The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, the problem was presented on the imageboard as \\"The Haruhi Problem\\": if you wanted to watch the 14 episodes of the first season of the series in every possible order, what would be the shortest string of episodes you would need to watch? The proof for this lower bound came to the general public interest in October 2018, after mathematician and computer scientist Robin Houston tweeted about it. On 25 October 2018, Robin Houston, Jay Pantone, and Vince Vatter posted a refined version of this proof in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). For \\"The Haruhi Problem\\" specifically (the case for 14 symbols), the lower bound is currently at least 93,884,313,611, and the upper bound is at most 93,924,230,411. = Upper bounds = On 20 October 2018, by adapting a construction by Aaron Williams for constructing Hamiltonian paths through the Cayley graph of the symmetric group, Greg Egan devised an algorithm to produce superpermutations of length n! + (n‚àí1)! + (n‚àí2)! + (n‚àí3)! + n ‚àí 3. Up to 2018, these were the smallest superpermutations known for n ‚â• 7. However, on 1 February 2019, Bogdan Coanda announced that he had found a superpermutation for n=7 of length 5907, or (n! + (n‚àí1)! + (n‚àí2)! + (n‚àí3)! + n ‚àí 3) ‚àí 1, which was a new record. On 27 February 2019, using ideas developed by Robin Houston, Egan produced a superpermutation for n = 7 of length 5906. Whether similar shorter superpermutations also exist for values of n > 7 remains an open question. The current best lower bound (see section above) for n = 7 is still 5884.

RuddGrossman, Ignacio E. ‚ÄúResearch Challenges in Process Engineering‚Äù, Grossman Research Group, Carnegie Mellon  Early life  Rudd was born in 1935 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and received his BS in 1956 and his Ph.D. in 1959 in Chemical Engineering under Neal Amundson from the University of Minnesota. He was an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor before joining the Chemical and Biological Engineering department at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1961.  Professor at Wisconsin  At the University of Wisconsin he developed the field of process synthesis in computerized process design. Process synthesis is used to design processes that can be used in commercial chemical plants. The significance is it uses computer algorithms to determine the chemical processes, reducing the costly need to test chemicals in full-scale production. Rudd's strategies have been used in areas such as waste treatment, chemical production and food processing. University of California Provost C. Judson King called Rudd's work ‚Äútruly pioneering and important‚Äù. Rudd co-wrote with Charles C. Watson \\"Strategy of Process Engineering\\" (1968, John Wiley & Sons; Spanish Edition 1976), the first textbook in the field.

History  Immediately after the fall of Constantinople to the Crusade in April 1204, quarrels began between the Crusaders over the division of the spoils. The town of Demotika was originally apportioned to Baldwin of Flanders, the new Latin Emperor, but was seized for a while by Boniface of Montferrat after Baldwin seized the latter's preferred territory, Thessalonica. Eventually, peace was restored and Boniface received Thessalonica, which became a kingdom, while Demotika reverted to the Latin Empire. In October 1204, following the definitive partition of the former Byzantine Empire (Partitio Romaniae), Demotika was given as a fief to Hugh IV of Saint Pol, a Picard veteran of the Third Crusade who would die soon after, in March 1205, in Constantinople. Latin rule in Thrace was not secure, however, as it was threatened by the Bulgarian Empire in the north, and the resentment of the local Orthodox Greek population towards their new Roman Catholic masters. Thus in early 1205, the locals rose up in revolt in Demotika, Adrianople and other cities, evicted their Latin garrisons, and acknowledged the suzerainty of the Bulgarian Tsar Kalojan. Baldwin of Flanders responded by marching into Thrace and besieging Adrianople, but at the subsequent Battle of Adrianople (April 14, 1205) the Latin army suffered a crushing defeat and Baldwin was taken prisoner. Soon, however, Kalojan began massacring the Greek inhabitants of the cities of Serres and Philippopolis, causing the Greeks to rally behind the new regent of the Latin Empire, Henry of Flanders. Thus in early 1206 the inhabitants of Demotika and Adrianople submitted to the Greek lord Theodore Branas, who was in the Latin Emperor's service. The initial Bulgarian sieges of Demotika and Adrianople failed due to the resistance of the citizenry under Branas and the arrival of a relief army under Henry, but in early autumn Kalojan succeeded in sacking Demotika. Henry, now Latin Emperor, managed to recapture the inhabitants as they were being taken prisoner to Bulgaria, but before he withdrew from Demotika, Kalojan ordered the town's fortifications razed, making it useless as a military base.

It was one of three movable bridges planned by the City of Bridgeport in 1916 at the request of the War Department during World War I. Construction was completed in 1919, but the delays surrounding the construction went to the Connecticut Supreme Court in case of Edward DeV. Tompkins, Inc. vs. City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. The court ruled in favor of Tompkins and awarded damages equal to the contract. In 1936, the bridge had excessive settling and required the replacement of its southeast pier. As part of the repairs, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the floor was replaced with a steel grate on I-beam floor. In 1984, the eastern approach span was replaced and the northwest trunnion post was reconstructed. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and dismantled in 1999.  Construction  Requests for bids for the Grand Street Bridge were announced in the trade publication Contractor, for the \\"substructure, superstructure and approaches\\". Originally the deadline was set for April 6, 1916, but it was later extended to May 6, 1916. The June 1916 issue of Contractor announced that Edward DeVoe Tompkins, Inc., obtained the contract with the lowest bid of $187,000. The contract, signed on May 16, 1916, stipulated that work on the bridge was to begin within 15 days and the project's original deadline would be September 1, 1917. The engineering firm which provided the design was the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company, and the fabricator of the steel was the Penn Bridge Company. The moving bridge had two bascule leaves, each long that were connected by a long deck-girder approach, for a total overall length of . The girders were in width; which were wider than the bascules. The angle-iron outriggers added another on each side, making the bridge's total width . The original floor was made of wooden blocks atop wooden planks. The contract called for the complete construction of the bridge, including the approaches on each side of the river and four piers with each consisting of two cylindrical columns of reinforced concrete. Construction of the bridge was complicated by the contract which stipulated that concrete had to be pumped dry, the concrete of each cylinder had to be poured in \\"one continuous operation\\" and that the wooden piles for the pier must project at least six feet into the concrete base. These stipulations required the use of a cofferdam to deposit the concrete, but boring in the river showed that it did not have a suitable bottom upon which to build. Tompkins would have to construct a thick artificial bottom in order to proceed. To deposit in accordance with the contract, a tremie would be needed. A tremie is a pipe that concrete is passed through so it doesn't contact the water and disintegrate. The plans were stipulated to be presented by May 26, but it first submitted on June 2 with the sketches of the design following on June 14, 1916. The project was delayed due to the consulting engineer's proposals being denied by the Bridgeport bridge commission and the \\"ambiguous and contradictory requirements\\" advanced and by the position of the consulting engineer. The project was delayed for months because due to the consulting engineer's discussions, via mail, between Bridgeport and Chicago. Construction of the concrete wing-piles and slabs began around August 1, 1916 and the substructure was nearly completed by January 31, 1917, the original deadline for that part of the project, but the issue with the construction of the piers had already greatly delayed the construction. In early 1917, Tompkins submitted a plan to attempt a pumping out of the constructed cofferdam, which it noted as dangerous to the crew. This plan was denied because there was no artificial seal in place. The commission did not want Tompkins to proceed until the commission consulted an advisory engineer. In April 1917, William Burr was made the advisory engineer and made many changes to the original Strauss designs, most importantly the requirement that piers project into the concrete cylinders was stricken. Burr's alterations called for an open caisson for the central piers which made impossible the projection of piles into the concrete and required dredging that was unnecessary under the initial Strauss plan. The seal for the end piers was thickened to and would be deposited through a tremie, as previously suggested by Tompkins. The Bridgeport bridge commission terminated the contract on August 20, 1917 and notified Tompkins that it would complete the project. The commission had Tompkin's crew forcibly ejected from the site on September 3, 1917 and took possession of its equipment until October 19, 1917. While the contract allowed the equipment to be taken, it also stipulated that delays that were the fault of the city would result in an equal extension to the time lost and Tompkins would sue the City of Bridgeport. The City of Bridgeport hired another contractor to complete the bridge. The cylindrical piers of the bridge were in diameter and finished with an ashlar of cut granite. The completed bridge had its bascule leaves pivot on trunnions located from the end of the girders. The bridge's reinforced- concrete counterweights, measuring high by wide, was supported by pivots at the ends of the girders. The trunnions were supported by box-girder posts on the sides of the bascule leaves and each set of inside trunnion posts were braced by a girder ran both between them and to the operating mechanism. Earle Gear and Machine Company provided the operating mechanism for the bridge. The bascule leaves were raised by a motor that used reduction gears and engaged a pinion to move the rack quadrant to raise the bridge. A manual-operation shaft was originally present so that it could be operated from the surface of the roadway, but it was later paved over. The operator's house was located on the south side of the western approach, it originally housed the operator's house and public bathrooms, but it was removed in 1936. The plans originally dictated for a second station on the opposite end, but 1930s photos shows it was apparently never constructed.  Court case  Edward DeVoe Tompkins, Inc. suffered numerous delays in the construction of the bridge and sued the City of Bridgeport. The case went to the Connecticut Supreme Court in Edward DeV. Tompkins v. City of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Tompkins sued the City of Bridgeport for breach of contract on the grounds that City of Bridgeport was unresponsive, and did not clear the site as scheduled. Tompkins also cited other concerns relating to the design and construction of the bridge including the design engineers from the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company being located in Chicago. The City of Bridgeport alleged that Tompkins was incompetent and uncooperative, but the Connecticut Supreme Court disagreed and ruled in favor of Tompkins. The Court awarded Tompkins the full contract as damages.  Service Life  The Grand Street Bridge opened for traffic in 1919, but had to be closed in 1932 after the southeast pier was excessively settled. The Connecticut Highway Department and federal government provided the funds required to remove the bascule leaves and replace the pier in 1936. As a part of the renovations, a new floor and electrical system were installed. In 1965, the bridge floor was replaced with steel grating atop 14-inch (36-cm) I-beam stringers. In 1984, the eastern approach span and northwest trunnion post, the point where the bridge pivots, were reconstructed as part of what would be the bridge's last major renovations. Other minor repairs to the bridge's steel and masonry were done during the project. The bridge was closed in the 1990s and it was dismantled in 1999. In 2010, the United States Coast Guard struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal. Previously, the rule stated that the bridge need not open for the passage of vessels.

Moseley Drive in Stockbridge, Georgia, United States. The school's teams are known as the Wolfpack.Woodland High School website  History  Woodland School is located in the old Flat Rock Settlement, named for a large granite outcropping located just northwest of here on the former Kelley Sims plantation, present day site of White Acres Subdivision. Kelley Sims and his father in law John Cook, a veteran of the War of 1812, were large planters and utilized the Flat Rock as an antebellum solar grain drier for their granary. From the earliest pioneer days this area was known as Flat Rock. The Flat Rock Post Office was organized in 1837 and Flat Rock Church organized in 1883, the name of the church was changed to Hemphill in 1917. The only place the Flat Rock name survives is on nearby Flat Rock Road, which was the old road to Stockbridge before Hwy. 138 was straightened and paved. No records have been found indicating when Flat Rock School was founded; however, we do know the school dates back to before 1894 since it is listed in the earliest records of the Henry County Board of Education. In September 1905 the people of Flat Rock petitioned the county for funds to support Flat Rock School. The petitioners represented some of the most prominent farmers in the community The family names include: Askew, Bellah, Coker, Cook, Henry, Hinton, Morris, Moseley, Phillips and Walden. By October 8, 1906 the school had been renamed Woodland School. In 1914, the School Board appropriated $400 to build a third classroom at Woodland School. In 1916, the county agreed to pay one half the $90 cost of a new veranda and repairs to the school; the other half to be paid by the parents. Between 1920 and 1940 the population of Henry County declined by 25 percent. Talk of closing Woodland began in 1923; however, the final consolidation of the Woodland School District did not occur until 1934. The Woodland District was split down the middle and half the students went to Stockbridge School while the other half went to Pleasant Grove School. This area of Henry County has always been home to adventurous, honest, intelligent, hardworking people who love faith, family and country. Woodland School has a great history and a bright future.

It was released in 2010 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox Live on Xbox 360, and iOS. The player controls a ship, allowing them to explore the world and engage in trading while seeking three artifacts that will help to defeat the game's main antagonist, a sea creature called the Ancient Guardian. The game design was influenced by board games and the video games Elite and Advance Wars. The game was developed using Microsoft XNA, and took one year to complete with a team of six people. Lead designer Peter Levius worked with the artist Petr Vcelka on the game's graphic design, and with Milan Malik on the game's score. Ancient Trader received a positive response from critics, who praised the art design and overall gameplay. A sequel, Fortune Winds: Ancient Trader, was developed by Legendo Entertainment and released in 2012 for Microsoft Windows. Gameplay Ancient Trader is a turn-based strategy video game played from a two-dimensional perspective. The player controls a ship and seeks out three artifacts to defeat the game's final boss, a sea creature called the Ancient Guardian. The player explores the map to gather items, including tea, spices, and fruit, all of which can be found in wrecks. These can be exchanged for gold, which can be used to buy upgrades for the ship. The commodities are stored in the cargo hold, the capacity of which can be upgraded with gold. Ancient Trader gameplay is split in two parts. The first, turn-based strategy mode (above) is experienced while playing most of the game. The second, a card minigame (below), is triggered with a battle between the player and a non-playable character. At the beginning of the game, the entire map is obscured until explored by the player. The map consists of a landlocked sea with several islands, wreckage, sea creatures, enemy ships, ports, and whirlpools. The player can sometimes encounter message bottles that clear away fog of war on the map to reveal hidden ports. Sea creatures and enemy ships appear randomly and challenge the player for gold or commodities in a card minigame. Ports are trading and safe zones where the player can sell commodities, buy upgrades for the ship, and take on sidequests. Whirlpools teleport the player's ship to a random location on the map. The ship can be moved horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally. The player makes a set number of steps each turn, after which the artificial intelligence does the same for non-playable characters (NPCs). If the player's ship is not docked at a port at the end of a turn, the player can be attacked by an enemy ship or a sea creature. If they are attacked, a card minigame is triggered to decide if the player loses gold to a rival ship or cargo to a sea creature. The player and NPC draw coloured and numbered cards; the highest-numbered card wins each turn, unless presented against a powerful color. The strongest hue receives an attack bonus. The player's following turn starts after the minigame is completed. Ancient Trader does not include a saving feature, which means that all progress is lost if the game is closed. An online multiplayer mode allows for several players to simultaneously play the same map, chase the artifacts, and defeat the Guardian. The prices of the artifacts increase as other players buy them. The players can check the wealth and artifacts gained by other players. The game also includes several alternative game modes, which focus on reaching a set total wealth or cash tally before other players. The multiplayer does not include an online scoreboard. Development Ancient Trader is the first video game developed by the Slovakian studio 4Kids Games. The development team consisted of the lead designer Peter Levius, the artist Petr Vcelka, the game designer Miroslav Petrasko, and the programmer Andrej Vakrcka. The score was composed by Milan Malik, while Jan Ohajsky designed and animated the graphics. The game was developed using Microsoft XNA, a set of game development tools. According to Levius, Ancient Trader took around one year to finish; \\"most of our team members [...] were working hard on other higher priority projects at the same time\\". The game was submitted for XNA approval on 2 June 2010. Ancient Traders design was influenced by that of board games and of the video games Elite and Advance Wars. Levius and his girlfriend dedicated around two months to test and balance the game's mechanics, gathering groups of friends to play the game \\"without explaining anything to see if they can understand the rules and controls\\". He worked with Vcelka to design Ancient Traders appearance, including paper textures and clouds. He revealed that some of the maps' features came from a scan of an old military map of present-day Slovakia. According to Chris Schilling from Eurogamer, Vcelka took inspiration from sixteenth and seventeenth-century cartography, as well as from Abraham Ortelius and his Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, to create \\"exceptionally detailed art\\". For the Xbox 360 version, the team introduced a feature to reduce the colour saturation in the game and allow players to decide how much colour they wanted to have. Levius acknowledged that this feature \\"is a big thing for me and Petr as we always wanted to also have a black and white version of the game in style of Jules Verne's illustrations\\". He also commented that several other features, such as more animations and leaderboards, were left out due to a lack of time, but he kept them in mind for a possible sequel. Reception Ancient Trader received positive responses from several video game journalists upon its release. Most critics praised the game's art design and gameplay, but criticized the lack of key elements such as a saving feature and scoreboards. The British magazine Edge included Ancient Trader in its 2010 list of the Best 20 Indie Games available in the Xbox Live Marketplace. They acknowledged that the game was \\"ambitious, devious and surprisingly hard to fault\\". IGN staff called it \\"a simple, easy entry strategy game suitable for all ages\\". Tom Chick from FidGit compared Ancient Trader to video games such as The Seven Cities of Gold and Sid Meier's Pirates!, as well as to other indie games such as \\"the sci-fi space operettas Strange Adventures in Infinite Space and Flotilla, but wind- powered and sepia-toned\\". Like most reviewers, Chick highly praised the artistic design, as well as the game's atmospheric music and vividness of the environment: \\"It's all ink and vellum and cursive script and layers of lovingly drawn facades drawn on plywood and stacked up for a 19th Century stage production.\\" Eurogamer's Chris Schilling commented that although Ancient Trader was not as comprehensive and expansive as other Xbox Live titles such as Risk: Factions, it deserved \\"the opportunity to do business with the big boys rather than risk getting washed away with the shovelware tide\\". Schilling expressed concern that \\"a game so elegant and accomplished should have to be dredged up from the depths of Indie Games\\". Lorenzo Fantoni from Eurogamer Italy awarded Ancient Trader the same score as Schilling, and explained that \\"the final result is a quite simple title, which will last long enough to make you feel happy of having invested your money in this indie title\\". Gus Mastrapa from Wired commented that Ancient Trader was well worth its price \\"for its art alone\\". He praised the game's overall style, \\"borrowed from centuries-old maps ... more handsome than any other game you'll find in the Xbox Live indie category\\".  Sequel  A sequel, Fortune Winds: Ancient Trader, was developed by Swedish studio Legendo Entertainment and released in July 2012 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Fortune Winds includes improved AI, new player avatars and a save feature. GamesMaster was unimpressed with the sequel. The magazine awarded it 69 out of 100 and commented that it deviated too much from the original indie game.

It is commonly known as the furry sea cucumber or the fissured sea cucumber and is native to the Caribbean Sea. Description Astichopus multifidus is a robust, soft-bodied species growing to a maximum length of and width of . Both its dorsal and ventral surfaces are uniformly covered with hundreds of tube feet, those on the dorsal surface being extended into papillae, fleshy conical projections about long with tube feet at their tips. This sea cucumber is chocolate brown or dark grey, sometimes mottled with paler patches or speckled with many small white spots. Distribution and habitat Astichopus multifidus is native to the Caribbean region. Its range includes the West Indies, the southern tip of Florida, the Dry Tortugas and the region of the Campeche Bank and southwards to Colombia and Venezuela. It is found on sandy seabeds near reefs and occasionally in seagrass meadows, at depths ranging between . Biology Astichopus multifidus spends the day buried in the sand, emerging at night to feed. It is a scavenger and detritivore and ingests large quantities of sediment from which organic matter is extracted as it passes through its gut. It can move much more rapidly than most sea cucumbers and can cover almost 2 m (6 ft) in a minute. Locomotion is mostly by crawling or rolling, but fast progress can be made by \\"bounding\\". Status The IUCN has rated Astichopus multifidus as being of \\"Least Concern\\". Other species of sea cucumber found in the Caribbean have been more heavily exploited than this species, but as stocks get depleted, it can be expected to be increasingly targeted. The population trend of Astichopus multifidus is unknown but its range includes some protected areas, and the gathering of sea cucumbers is illegal in Panama, Costa Rica and Venezuela.

Early life and career Pascau was born in 1938 in Mauritius. At the age of nineteen he joined the Mauritius Broadcasting Service. For his work at the MBS, Pascau was awarded a three-year scholarship to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. While at Guildhall, he worked as a freelance reporter for the British Home Office. Canadian broadcasting career =Early work= In 1965, Pascau moved to Montreal, where he established himself as the host of a popular call-in talk show. He also worked as a reporter for CBC Radio's Cross Country Checkup and CBC Television's Hourglass. He later moved to CFCF-TV, Montreal's CTV affiliate. While in Montreal, Pascau established himself as one of the city's leading investigative reporters. During the October Crisis Pascau, who was then working for CKLM, was contacted by the members of the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec (FLQ) responsible for kidnapping British diplomat James Cross and served as an intermediary between them and the government. In 1974, Pascau was chosen to co-host Canada AM. According to co-host Helen Hutchinson, Pascau was \\"all wrong\\" for the job because as someone who did not grow up in the country, he \\"couldn't ad-lib all sorts of facts about Canada to keep the conversation going\\". He was replaced by Norm Perry in 1975. =CKAC= Pascau then moved to CKAC, where he hosted L'Informateur, a midday show that combined phone calls and interviews. L'Informateur spent ten years as the highest rated show in Montreal and attracted many politicians and newsmakers. He also gained a reputation as a \\"fiery Quebec nationalist\\". In May 1990, Pascau suddenly left the station, citing an ongoing dispute with fellow CKAC personality Suzanne Levesque. Pascau, a non-smoker, was upset that Levesque smoked in the studio while hosting the program that preceded his. However, station management claimed that Pascau was using this as an excuse to leave the station for CKVL. He was replaced by Andr√© Arthur. =CKVL= In June 1990, Pascau began hosting Le Point du Jour, a three-hour morning program on CKVL. Unlike L'Informateur, Le Point du Jour contained news, weather, sports, and traffic reports in addition to phone calls and interviews. Crime reporter Claude Poirier and La Presse sports columnist Rejean Tremblay contributed to the show. In 1996, Raymond Villeneuve, the leader of the Mouvement de Lib√©ration Nationale du Qu√©bec, made some extreme comments against Jews and anglophones, including that bombs or Molotov cocktails could be used against Anglophone activist Howard Galganov. The interview led Alliance Quebec to file a complaint with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, which ruled that Pascau almost stepped over the line when he urged Villeneuve to repeat warnings about firebombings against Jews, but they fell just short of \\"the line of acceptable comment in a democratic society\\". On 2 May 1997, Pascau left CKVL at the end of his contract. According to station general manager Pierre Arcand, Pascau tired of waking up at 4 a.m. to do his morning show and had become disillusioned by the trend of politicians bypassing serious interviews in favour of photo ops and appearances on lighter shows. His final program included tributes from Roger Landry, Liza Frulla, and Francois Bourassa, who recalled his father, Robert Bourassa's, admiration for Pascau's interview skills. He was replaced by Jean-Fran√ßois Bertrand. Retirement After leaving broadcasting, Pascau left Canada for Australia to lived his final years in Brisbane, where he died in 2017.http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2017/02/28/un-grand-de-la-radio-seteint- a-lage-de-78-ans References Category:1938 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Canadian radio personalities Category:Canadian television reporters and correspondents Category:CBC Radio hosts Category:Alumni of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama Category:Mauritian emigrants to Canada Category:Jews from Quebec Category:Mauritian Jews Category:Journalists from Montreal Category:Quebec sovereigntists Category:Immigrants to Quebec Category:Canadian television news anchors Category:CTV Television Network people ","title":"Pierre Pascau"},{"id":"42223936","text":"Seydelia turlini is a moth in the family Erebidae.

The film stars R. H. Thomson and Sheila McCarthy as Hal and Diana Kingswood, a married couple living on Galiano Island in British Columbia in the 1960s with their two daughters, Cleo (Tara Frederick) and Zoe (Aloka McLean). Plot The story is told mostly through the eyes of Zoe, the younger Kingswood daughter. The Kingswoods seem to live a happy life, though teenage Cleo is frustrated with an inability to do things, like travel to Vancouver to see the Beatles. A catalyst for change for their somewhat stagnant lives arrives in the form of Anne-Marie (Mich√®le-Barbara Pelletier), Zoe's new teacher at the school where Hal Kingswood is principal. Anne-Marie arrives late on her first day of work with all of her belongings packed into her Volkswagen bus and takes up residence in a local cottage. The new teacher's progressive ideas shake up the little school, much to the irritation of Hal, the staid and stodgy principal. Zoe and most of her class are immediately delighted with the lovely and vivacious young Anne-Marie, who teaches them through song and art. One evening, Anne-Marie invites Zoe over to her cottage. As Anne-Marie bathes in her wood-fired, outdoor bathtub, she gives Zoe a book of spells, which is ostensibly the mechanism through which change comes to the sleepy little island. Change is relatively mild at first - Cleo gets her first boyfriend, Dwayne Spittle, and Zoe learns how to make the wind gust. Real change comes to Galiano Island when Hal discovers (thanks to Zoe) that his father hasn't been dead for decades, as previously presumed, and has only recently died (his ashes were shipped to Hal's mother). Hal's father abandoned Hal and his mother, Flora (Frances Hyland), when Hal was a child. Hal is rocked by the revelation of his father's abandonment, the fact that his father was alive, and his mother's lies. The combination of the shock of Hal's father's death and Hal's anger leads Flora to suffer a stroke. Hal is in a tailspin. When he chances upon Anne-Marie crying in her bus, he takes a moment to learn more about her, discovering that she abandoned her fiance at the altar and that her mother calls her every morning to remind her that she is a disappointment. As Anne-Marie talks of wanting to sail away to Mexico, Hal joins in and the two of them share a kiss, which scares both of them. As fall sets in, Hal gets closer to Anne-Marie while Cleo gets closer to her new boyfriend, Dwayne. After Halloween, Zoe and her friend, Jo, see Hal's car parked in front of Anne-Marie's cottage and decide to take a closer peek. They discover the two lovers kissing passionately and quietly sneak away. Zoe attempts to curse her teacher with limited success. In the meantime, Cleo and Dwayne break the news to Cleo's parents that Cleo is pregnant and they are not getting married, leaving Hal and Diana reeling. When Diana Kingswood discovers that Anne-Marie has no plans for Christmas, she immediately insists she have Christmas dinner with them. It's all too much for Zoe and she bolts from the dinner table. When Hal follows her up to her room, Zoe confronts him about his affair with Anne-Marie. Soon, everyone at the table knows. Diana kicks out Hal and burns his boat to the ground. Unexpectedly, Hal's mother, Flora, passes away. Diana and Hal embrace at the funeral. Anne-Marie is confronted by her students about her affair with Hal and soon resigns. Anne-Marie leaves town and is replaced by a young male teacher. Production The film was originally slated to be directed by Sandy Wilson,\\"Go west, young filmmaker\\". The Globe and Mail, 1 September 1993. but Shapiro stepped in after Wilson dropped the project in favour of Harmony Cats. It was the only theatrical feature film released by Shapiro, who is primarily known as a television director. Streaming As of 2018 the film has begun streaming online for free on Canada Media Fund's Encore+ YouTube channel.

He worked for a time on the railroad before becoming an author by 1923, and had a strong interest in social welfare; this interest influenced his novels. He was also a productive translator, dramatist, and reporter, and operated a company which offered writing services. Sources disagree when Joehana died; some offer 1930, while others give 1942‚Äì45. During the seven years in which he was active, Joehana wrote a number of stories and articles, as well as several novels. The years of publication are generally unclear, as reprints included neither the year of first publication nor the printing number. Stylistically, Joehana has been classified as a realist owing to his use of the names of actual locations and products in his works, as well as the predominantly vernacular Sundanese in his novels. However, influences from traditional theatrical forms such as and literature such as are evident. Joehana's works cover a wide range of themes, although in general they are oriented towards social criticism and promote modernization. Though Joehana's works were published independently, they were popular in the Bandung area where they were sold. Local businesses may have offered funds for product placement, and Joehana's works were adapted to the stage and film. However, they received little academic attention until the 1960s, and critical consensus since then has been negative. Two of his works have been republished since the 1960s, and stage productions of his novel Rasiah nu Goreng Patut continued into the 1980s. Biography It is uncertain when Akhmad Bassah was born, though he is thought to have been raised in Bandung, western Java, where he graduated from a Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs. Bassah spent time working on the state-operated railroad, apparently rising to a fairly high position, but was fired for organizing a strike of the Union of Train and Tramway Personnel. Although he left the company, Bassah remained active in social movements. He was an active member of the Sarekat Rakyat (People's Union), an organization with communist leanings, and helped that group in its mission of social service. Through contemporary reports it is clear that by 1923 Bassah had begun to make a name as a writer, and that he had also become active in the theatre and as a journalist. Bassah signed his writings \\"Joehana\\", taken from the name of his adoptive daughter; he is best remembered by that pen name. Although he was married to a schoolteacher named Atikah, they had no biological children. Throughout his writing career, Joehana wrote independently, unattached to any publishing house. At the time, Balai Pustaka, a publisher operated by the Dutch colonial government, was attracting numerous Sundanese-language writers. His biographers Tini Kartini et al. suggest that Joehana rejected his contemporaries' approach, choosing to work independently rather than again work for the government which had fired him and would certainly censor his works. This, they write, is shown through the themes common in the stories: where his contemporaries focused on escapist literature and entertainment, Joehana focused on social criticism. However, Ajip Rosidi, a scholar of Sundanese literature, suggests that Joehana's refusal to use formal Sundanese meant that Balai Pustaka would not accept his works. In 1928, Joehana opened the Romans Bureau, which was advertised as offering a variety of services, including the writing and printing of advertisements, translations (from or into English, Dutch, Malay, and Sundanese), and the preparation of story concepts for other writers. Joehana may have also opened a writing course, although apparently most of his income was derived from the royalties of his publications. These publications, particularly his novels, were generally inspired by the types of works that were popular at the time of writing. One of his students, Abdullah Syafi'i Sukandi, recalled that Nangis Wibisana (The Tears of Wibisana) had been written when the dangding (a traditional lyrical form) Tjeurik Oma (Oma's Cry) was popular, whereas Goenoeng Gelenjoe (The Smiling Mountain) had been written during a period of increased interest in humorous anecdotes. Joehana died after helping put together a stage performance based on his novel Kalepatan Poetra Dosana Iboe Ramaa (The Sins of the Son are the Sins of the Mother and Father) in Tasikmalaya. His body is buried in Bandung. Sources disagree regarding the year of his death. Atikah dates it to 1930,quoted in a year which Rosidi supports. Meanwhile, the publisher Kiwari, which reissued Rasiah nu Goreng Patut in 1963, cites the author as having died during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies (1942‚Äì45); this estimate has also been reported by literary critic Jakob Soemardjo, who gives Joehana's estimated age at time of his death as 35. Works Tjarios Agan Permas (third volume; 1926 edition) Moegiri (second volume; 1928 edition) Joehana's ≈ìuvre consists of fourteen books, as well as numerous editorials and articles in the newspaper Soerapati. In their 1979 review of the author, Kartini et al. were able to find only six extant titles. It is difficult to determine the original year of publication for these works, for although Joehana's books generally included a year of publication, the printing number was not recorded. As such, sources list works as having been published in different years; for instance, Tjarios Agan Permas is variously dated 1923, 1926, and 1928. The following list is based on the one compiled by Kartini et al. in their 1979 study. It does not include any of Joehana's work as a journalist, nor does it include works he published through his Romans Bureau. * (based on wayang stories) * (three volumes; 148 pages total) * (three volumes) * (joke book; 31 pages) * * (at least two volumes) * (one volume; 44 pages) * (two volumes; 74 pages) * (a dangding) * (two volumes) * (unpublished) * (one volume; with Soekria) * * Style Joehana appears to have been familiar with the traditional literatures of Maritime Southeast Asia, drawing on the Ramayana for Nangis Wibisana. Wayang characters such as the clown Cepot are referred to in his writings, and he draws on traditional Sundanese storytelling techniques, such as the pantun form of poetry common in wayang golek performances. However, there are significant shifts. His writings depart from the traditional forms of literature such as wawacan, instead embracing the novel, a European literary form. Unlike the formal language used in traditional literature, Joehana wrote in everyday Sundanese. The grammar and structure shows evidence of influence from other languages, and the vocabulary is likewise not purely Sundanese; some Dutch (the language of the colonial government) is mixed in. The Sundanese author M. A. Salmoen classifies Joehana as a realist.in Rosidi writes that a sense of realism was promoted in Joehana's writings through the use of references to existing (and often popular) brands of products, including cigars, salted fish, and biscuits (though, as Joehana wrote for persons in contemporary Bandung who were expected to know these products, they are not given any in-text explanation). Joehana used real-life Bandung locations in his novels, and local figures prominent in the news (such as the pickpocket Salim) are mentioned in passing. There is also the possibility that the use of such names are a form of product placement, in which Joehana was paid to include the names of the products in his novels; this payment may not have been direct, but in the form of goods or services, or a donation to Sarekat Rakyat. Joehana displayed a sense of humour that was well received by his contemporaries: for instance, the frog chaser Karnadi of Rasiah nu Goreng Patut describes his trips to the rice fields to catch frogs as \\"going to the office\\" and the stick with which he kills the frogs as his \\"pencil\\", whereas the Dutchman Van der Zwak of Tjarios Agan Permas uses the most polite register of Sundanese while speaking to his dog. Some of these jokes have remained popular; Rosidi records one, about how to speak Dutch, as having survived into the 1980s. Themes The dominant theme in Joehana's work is social criticism, particularly regarding socioeconomic conditions. In Rasiah nu Goreng Patut, he criticised those who sought material wealth above all other things through the Eulis Awang and her family, who are so enraptured by their greed that they do not realize that the man asking for Eulis Awang's hand in marriage is not who he claims to be. In Tjarios Eulis Atjih, the main characters Arsad and Eulis Atjih, while both exemplifying greed and its inevitable repercussions, further show that wealth is not eternal: both lose their wealth and societal positions, then must earn a living. In the novel, Johanna calls on the rich to support and defend the poor, not despise them. That both rich and poor should receive equal treatment is emphasised in Tjarios Agan Permas: Another traditionally respected group which Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims who have been on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown. Although Joehana rejects forced marriage--a common practice among the Sundanese in the early 20th century--and promotes the idea of marriage for love, he also warns against the dangers of overly free interactions between men and women. Through Kalepatan Poetra Dosana Iboe Rama he condemns forced marriage by depicting the marriage of a young woman to a wealthy man who is old enough to be her father; this ultimately leaves the woman an outcast, reaping the \\"sins\\" of her parents. Both Moegiri and Neng Jaja, meanwhile, dealt with young women who were overly free in their interactions with men, and thus faced a sorrowful fate: divorce, abuse, and infidelity. Legacy Newspaper advertisement for Eulis Atjih (1927), adapted from Joehana's novel Joehana's works were commercially successful, and often adapted to the stage. His Rasiah nu Goreng Patut, for instance, was adapted into a variety of forms, including as a Malay-language lenong, and a stage performance of Tjarios Eulis Atjih is recorded in Ciamis. Three films have been adapted from novels by Joehana, two from Tjarios Eulis Atjih and one from Rasiah nu Goreng Patut. The first, Eulis Atjih, was directed and produced by G. Krugers and released in 1927 to popular success. The second, generally referred to as Karnadi Anemer Bangkong, was adapted from Rasiah nu Goreng Patut by Krugers and released in the early 1930s; it is known to have been a commercial failure, reportedly raising controversy for depicting a Muslim man eating frog meat. The third adaptation of a Joehana novel, also titled Eulis Atjih, was completed by Rd Ariffien in 1954. Stage performances of Rasiah nu Goreng Patut continued as late as 1980, though by that time the work was considered by the general public as part of folklore. Little academic discourse on Joehana was published until the 1960s; according to Kartini et al., this is attributable to Joehana's use of non-formal Sundanese. This renewal began with the republication of two of his works: Rasiah nu Goreng Patut in 1963 as a standalone book by Kiwari, and Moegiri as a serial beginning with the 15 October 1965 edition of Sunda magazine. Rosidi, that magazine's editor, included discussion of Joehana in his 1966 book Kesusastraan Sunda Dewasa Ini (Contemporary Sundanese Literature). Some more discussion, by authors such as Yus Rusyana and Rusman Sutiamarga, was published in magazines such as Wangsit or included in university lectures. Until 1979 Joehana's works had not been taught in Sundanese-language courses in schools. Modern critical reception of Joehana's output has generally been negative. Sumardjo writes that his greatest weakness was a lack of in-depth exploration of characters' psyches, as well as a tendency to include an unclear social background. Kartini et al. note Joehana's productivity, but find a lack of characterisation in his works. They find that, at times, his attempt to convey a social message is so dominant that the works come across as propaganda. Rosidi gives a more positive view of Joehana's writing, noting that, although the use of non- formal Sundanese was contentious in the 1920s, it nonetheless meant the language in Joehana's works was more dynamic and \\"alive\\" than in works published by Balai Pustaka.

EDAS is not a public educational institution. Classes are held by the author's method, assuming the maximum involvement of students in the creative process. The school children are doing at the age 2.5‚Äì16 years. About the school School-Studio EDAS (Experimental Children's Architectural Studio) - a non-governmental studio of additional education for children was founded in 1977 by Vladislav Kirpichev. And since then is the first and unique children's architectural Studio, both in Russia and in the world. As described the history of EDAS formation Andrei Rodionov : \\"Kirpichev needed helpers to learn creative space available to him. He typed the command of children, believing in them, and they believed him. \\"And over time, school-studio has become a real \\"collective creative personality\\" with recognizable artistic techniques, special composite systems and formal common interests. The classes are held by the original technique (art technique), with the maximum involvement of pupils in the creative process. In the process of learning Kirpichev immerses children in the atmosphere of modern plastic problems in which occurs the formation of the project and compositional thinking, the feeling of form, space, rhythm, texture, color. Developing teaching methods, Vladislav Kirpichev found that the program must be dynamic and personalized, soft and non-violent. As a result, he formed the fundamental principles of the technique. In the Studio uses a unique language, suitable for expressing architectural fantasies. There is a constant mutual learning. Children not only follow the advice of the teacher, but also inspired by the works of the colleagues. School-Studio EDAS is not an educational institution in the conventional sense. Vladislav Kirpichev has repeatedly said that the existing system of education - child abuse. And the result achieved through hard work under strong pressure. When that is possible to teach otherwise is through self-education through motivation. In the studio school of Vladislav Kirpichev teachers are working on the development of creative abilities provoking the work of different kinds of thinking. Thereby, structuring the research development opportunities creativity is without limiting its professional purposes. EDAS founder sees the learning objectives in this. Kirpichev does not conduct competitions and selections of the students. He believes that \\"all the children are geniuses\\" and states that any child is able to develop his abilities. International recognition Due to the fact that the work of Vladislav Kirpichev widely known world over, EDAS constantly participates in various international events. Exhibitions, lectures and master classes of School -studio EDAS are regularly held in Russia, Europe and USA: \\\\- DAM (German Architecture Museum) - Frankfurt am Main, Germany, 1989 \\\\- Pacific Design Center (Los Angeles) and the Whitney Museum (New York) during the show Steelcase Design Partnership \\"Mondo Materialis\\", 1990 \\\\- Manezh Central Exhibition Hall, Moscow, 1990 \\\\- Documenta Archive Kassel - Kassel, Germany, 1991 \\\\- Central House of Artists (CHA) on the Crimean Val, Moscow, 1993 \\\\- NAi (National Architectural Center) - Rotterdam, 1995 \\\\- Akademie der K√ºnste and AEDES, Berlin \\\\- ICP (Institute of Cultural Policy) Hamburg 2006 In 2001, together with the Serpentine Gallery in Hyde Park in London was an action \\"100 children - 100 meters.\\" And in 2008, during the international festival The Darmstadt Summer of Architecture, installation EDAS \\"10,000 lights¬ª gathered at the opening more than 10 thousand of people.

In this episode, Emma Swan arrives in Storybrooke with Henry, only to discover that no one remembers how they were transported back ‚Äì or the past year they had spent back in fairy tale land. Emma teams up with Regina in an attempt to uncover who created the new curse. Meanwhile, in the fairy tale land that was during the past year, Regina, with the aid of Robin Hood, attempts to break into her castle, which has been overtaken by the Wicked Witch. The episode also marked the return of Mr. Gold/Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) who was believed to be deceased after he sacrificed himself in the mid-season finale in December 2013. \\"Witch Hunt\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics, with many complimenting the improvement and progression in the story lines. Upon airing, the episode was watched by 7.75 million viewers, attaining an 18-49 rating of 2.4. This figure was an increase of 0.09 million viewers from the spring premiere the previous week, whilst identical in terms of 18-49 rating. Plot =Opening Sequence= The Wicked Witch of the West flies around the forest on her broomstick. =In the Enchanted Forest= Back in The Enchanted Forest in the past year, the characters are walking through the forest. Although Regina is still missing Henry, she also starts thinking a lot about the tunnels that run under the castle, which is interrupted by the arrival of a flying monkey that was sent by Zelena, who is planning to attack Regina. Regina uses her magic and turns it into a stuffed monkey, which she hands to Robin‚Äôs son Roland. Belle says she‚Äôs read about the only land that has winged monkeys, and believes that they might be from a place called Oz; and it is most likely that the one now occupying Regina's castle is none other than the Wicked Witch of the West, as she is the only one known to have such creatures under her employ, but a snarky Regina responds to that comment of who is doing the bidding or orders by saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if the lollypop guild is protecting her,‚Äù and she‚Äôs going to get in that castle by herself without any help. However, Robin decides he's going to tag along anyway as a way to thank Regina for saving Roland. Robin suspects that Regina still misses someone in her life, even after admitting to him that she does. In the tunnels under the castle, Regina explains she has to put out a fire in the courtyard that powers the spell, only to discover to find the door open when its supposed to be sealed with blood magic. The door leads to a crypt with the coffin of her mother, Cora. As they head to her drawer, Robin becomes suspicious when she take a vial out, then he starts pulling a bow on her. It turns out that Regina is planning to put a sleeping spell on herself so Henry will find her one-day and embrace her again, after lowering the protection spell. Regina then freezes Robin so she can go through with it and does lower the protection spell, but just as she is about to take the spell, she is interrupted by Zelena, who then takes the potion pin from Regina and reveals to Regina that they both have one thing in common, besides magic and the fact that Rumplestiltskin trained them, that Cora is their mother and they are half- sisters. Zelena, who is furious that Cora gave Regina everything that she could never have, tells her younger sibling that she plans to take everything she had away from her as revenge. After Zelena flies off on her broom, Regina returns to the crypt and unfreezes Robin, where she tells him that she now has something to live for: someone to destroy. =In Storybrooke= In Storybrooke, Emma Swan and Captain Hook visit a very pregnant Mary Margaret and David at their home. Since everyone in town can not remember the previous year or how they came back to Storybrooke, Hook tells Mary Margaret he was with them for a short while in the Enchanted Forest the year before, then he left. While he was sailing, a bird brought him a note and the memory potion to inform him about what had happened and he thought Snow sent it. Leroy then arrives and announces that another dwarf is missing and the possibility that Neal might be also missing, so Emma decides they have to get their memories back, by figuring out who took them. Meanwhile, over at Granny's, Ruby brings Henry cocoa with cinnamon when Emma arrives with David and Mary Margaret and passes them off as friends from Phoenix. When Regina sees Henry, she freaks out. Emma then approaches Regina to try to figure out how to find the person who cast the new curse that bought everyone back to Storybrooke. Around the same time, Little John, who, along with the merry men, are unsuccessfully turkey hunting, is snatched by a flying monkey. The disappearance prompts Emma, Hook, and David to investigate, leading them to the city limits where he was last seen. After Emma leaves, Hook and David search the area and find a mauled Little John in the forest and is taken to the hospital. After they arrived at the hospital, Little John goes into convulsions and is transformed into a flying monkey, and makes an escape into the forest. Later on at the town hall meeting, Emma and Regina start an argument over who created the new curse (as the entire town is blaming Regina). She denies it and says she would have kept Henry, but Emma doesn't believe her. A furious Regina then disappears. A red-headed women with a green pendant looks suspicious. It is later revealed that back in the Mayor's office that Emma and Regina staged this performance together in an effort to distract the townspeople while they seek out the real source of the curse. It also turns out that Regina is trying to replicate the memory potion to get everyone's year-long memories back, but the chemistry experiment fails, so Emma suggests using an old bail bonds trick to expose the person by announcing that they have a memory potion almost done. Back at the cafe, Mary Margaret is freaking herself out reading a baby book, when a woman approaches and tells her that ‚Äúcradle cap‚Äù goes away. She tells Mary Margaret that hasn‚Äôt been in Storybrooke long, saying that she wasn't anyone she‚Äôd remember back in The Enchanted Forest. ‚ÄúI was a midwife,‚Äù she says, and introduces herself to Mary Margaret as Zelena, who then feels Mary Margaret's stomach, hearing and feeling the unborn child, as if she had something planned in the works for The Charmings. Later that night, Leroy (under the premise that Emma gave him the message that she found Regina) makes the announcement about the potion and Zelena gets up and walks out. Around the same time, Regina and Emma stake out the Mayor's office, where after they bond over Henry, the two get the break they were looking for and as they attempt to capture the person, the caped individual that broke in the office suddenly disappears in a puff of green smoke. Emma and Regina later return to the apartment, where Emma introduces Henry to Regina, but he doesn't remember her. David and Hook then arrive to tell the women about what happened to Little John. It appears that the missing residents are being turned into flying monkeys, and Regina believes that the only person who could be capable of doing this is The Wicked Witch of The West. Emma‚Äôs confused because they‚Äôre not in Kansas and is now learning that there is another character living among the residents. Unfortunately, at a farm house located outside Storybrooke, it is revealed that Zelena is actually The Wicked Witch of The West. She then brings a tray of food down into an underground cellar... where it is revealed that she is keeping a prisoner who has gone mad in a cage: Rumplestiltskin. Cultural references *The farm house and cellar where Zelena resides resembles the farm house and cellar in the Wizard of Oz film. *Another notable reference from the story included Emma alluding to the quote \\"I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore\\", made by Dorothy Gale, the main protagonist in the Oz series. *Emma and Henry's names mirror the first names of Dorothy's relatives, Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, in the Wizard of Oz series. (Although Aunt Em was actually short for \\"Emily\\".) *Belle mentions Oz in explaining the flying monkeys, which is fitting given that Emilie de Ravin, who plays Belle, is from Australia, nicknamed \\"Oz\\" by the people who were born or raised in the country. Australia is also where Dorothy Gale's relatives, both distant through her Uncle Henry, are from in the Oz series. *After Little John is transformed into a flying monkey and flies off, Dr. Whale responds by saying \\"I'm a doctor, not a vet,\\" echoing the catchphrase made famous by Dr. Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy from The Original Star Trek Series. *\\"Zelena\\" means \\"green\\" in various Slavic languages. Reception =Ratings= The episode fared extremely well in ratings, placing a 2.4/7 among 18-49s with 7.75 million American viewers tuning in, up 0.09 million viewers from the spring premiere the previous week. The increase in viewers made a change to the typically decreasing figures earlier from each episode in the season. =Critical reception= The episode was met with mostly positive reviews, with many critics complimenting the improvement and progression in the story lines. Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode a 9.2 out of 10, saying \\"Overall, the episode almost had too many \\"what?!\\" moments, but it worked. While I hope to see more of why the Wicked Witch is taking out her anger on Regina, we've seen enough to know she's interesting and that their battle has the potential to be game-changing.\\" Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly noted that \\"the plot only thickens when you throw in fan theories about how in Once's universe, the Dark One and the Wizard of Oz might end up being the same person. (Then again, Kitsis and Horowitz might want to stay away from such an obvious Wicked echo.)\\"'Once Upon a Time' recap: The 'Snare Witch' Project\\" from Entertainment Weekly (March 16, 2014) Christine Orlado of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.6 out of 5 stars. Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, noting that \\"Once Upon A Time fares so much better when it assumes this kind of self- referential tone with its audience; we‚Äôre just as familiar with these stories as the characters on the show are, so we can all be in on the startling insights or unexpected plot twists or sometimes, it‚Äôs even just helpful to be in on the joke.

It is a multidisciplinary research field at the intersection of virology, synthetic biology, computational biology, and DNA nanotechnology, from which it borrows and integrates its concepts and methodologies. There is a wide range of applications for synthetic viral technology such as medical treatments, investigative tools, and reviving organisms. Constructing de novo synthetic viruses Advances in genome sequencing technology and oligonucleotide synthesis paved the way for construction of synthetic genomes based on previously sequenced genomes. Both RNA and DNA viruses can be made using existing methods. RNA viruses have historically been utilized due to the typically small genome size and existing reverse transcription machinery present. The first man-made infectious viruses generated without any natural template were of the polio virus and the œÜX174 bacteriophage. With synthetic live viruses, it is not whole viruses that are synthesized but rather their genome at first, both in the case of DNA and RNA viruses. For many viruses, viral RNA is infectious when introduced into a cell (during infection or after reverse transcription). These organisms are able to sustain an infectious life cycle upon introduction in vivo. Applications This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies. The ability to synthesize viruses has far-reaching consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and permissive cells are available. As of March 2020, the full-length genome sequences of 9,240 different viruses, including the smallpox virus, are publicly available in an online database maintained by the National Institutes of Health. Synthetic viruses have also been researched as potential gene therapy tools.

During the area's estrangement from North Carolina, Wear's house was the headquarters for the local Sevier County militia, loyal to Franklin president, John Sevier. Wear served as a state constitutional delegate and was the first county clerk of Sevier County under the State of Franklin, 1786‚Äì1787.

In 1786, Wear was one of the emissaries to the Cherokee who negotiated the Treaty of Coyatee, re-affirming the 1785 Treaty of Dumplin (which Dragging Canoe's Chickamauga faction had refused to recognize). The new treaty extended the area for white settlement almost as far south as the Little Tennessee River, along which the main \\"Overhill Cherokee\\" towns were located. After the conclusion of hostilities with Great Britain, however, continuing encroachment into lands the Cherokee believed to be theirs‚Äîby treaty with the Federal government‚Äîcaused escalating violence in the area, especially south of the French Broad River. Wear's Fort was attacked by Chickamauga in 1793. At the time, he was commander of the Sevier County militia, then operating under the Territory South of the River Ohio's territorial-governor, William Blount. Wear led a punitive march against the village of Tallassee shortly thereafter. The expedition killed at least fifteen Cherokee, and captured four females. In 1794, several Cherokee fired on Wear and his two sons just outside Calvins Blockhouse (near Maryville), although the Wears escaped unharmed.Ramsey, J.G.M.; Annals of Tennessee; Johnson City; Tennessee; Overmountain Press; 1853 (reprinted 1999); ; p. 591. =Constitutional delegate= In 1795, as a constitutional convention delegate appointed by Sevier, Wear and four others met at Wears Fort and drafted the constitution presented to convention delegates in the establishment of the State of Tennessee.

Phlegm is a Welsh-born Sheffield-based muralist and artist who first developed his illustrations in self-published comics. The name 'Phlegm' came from one of the four temperaments in ancient Greek medicine; blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Phlegm was believed to be responsible for an apathetic and unemotional temperament. Overview Phlegm's work features in the urban landscape, and can mostly be seen in run- down and disused spaces. Phlegm creates surreal illustrations to an untold story, weaving a visual narrative that explores the unreal through creatures from his imagination. Phlegm's storybook-like imagery is half childlike, half menacing, set in built up Cityscapes with castles, turrets and winding stairways. At other times the city itself is the setting for his long limbed half-human, half-woodland creatures. In this dream world a viewer comes across impossible flying machines and complex networks of levers, pulleys and cogs, set beside telescopes, magnifying glasses and zephyrs. Working mostly in monochrome, his fine technique and intricate detail can be seen as a curiosity cabinet of the mind. Each drawing forms part of a grand narrative that extends worldwide, in countries including Norway, Canada, Switzerland, Sri Lanka, USA, Belgium, Poland, Italy, Slovakia, Spain and Australia. His work has also appeared in a variety of objects such as airplanes, boats, buildings, vehicles and many street art festivals. Exhibitions Phlegm's first solo show The Bestiary took place at the Howard Griffin Gallery on Shoreditch High Street, London from 1 February to 25 March 2014. In April 2019 he hosted 'Mausoleum of the Giants' in Sheffield, attracting over 12,000 visitors. Murals In January 2013, Phlegm painted on the Village Underground wall in London, UK. In February 2014, Phlegm teamed up with RUN and Christiaan Nagel on a mission to give final moments of vivacious life to yet another to be demolished building in London ‚Äì the Blithehale Medical Centre in Bethnal Green. In April and May 2014, Phlegm was one of several overseas artists to paint a series of murals in Dunedin, New Zealand as part of that city's Urban art festival. Other artists involved included Italy's Pixel Pancho and Poland's Natalia Rak. Phlegm was one of around 150 artists to paint murals in the Djerbahood Project in Erriadh, Tunisia, in the summer of 2014. In August 2016, Phlegm painted what was billed as the world's tallest mural to that time (8 storeys) in Toronto at 1 St. Clair West. Toronto resident Stephanie Bellefleur was his assistant.

Geography The site of the former village lies inmidst the Solling mountain range right at the Bundesstra√üe 241, where the ground ist made up of Loess. The nearest populated places are Lauenf√∂rde and Nienover. History According to results of archaeological digs by Hans-Georg Stephan and soil studies, the site used to be a wood pasture in the 8th century. Between 1150 and 1250, the Counts of Dassel had the woods cut area-wide, thus allowing agriculture and settlement of people. Some 25 to 40 farms developed there, probably to provide Nienover with food. The village was destroyed in 1342 by water of the Reiherbach amidst the St. Mary Magdalene's flood. Church ruin The village had a church that was built of stone in the years around 1200 in romanesque architectural style. The aisle had two bays. The choir was rectangular. The height of the tower was 15 to 20 meters by estimation. In the early modern period, people tore down the church in order to pave the street passing by. In 2006, the local historical society reconstructed the foundation walls of the church.

Pasternak, was a prominent American boxer. He was a top-ranked heavyweight of the 1940s who once challenged for the world title, losing to Joe Louis in 1939. Professional boxing career Pastor began his professional boxing career on January 26, 1935, his 21st birthday. In his professional debut he fought Julius Veight, a veteran who had a considerable experience advantage over the rookie boxer, with a record of 10 wins and 20 losses. The fight was held at Ridgewood Grove, Brooklyn, New York, and ended with Pastor outscoring Veight to win a six round points decision. The fight with Veight was the beginning of an eight fight winning streak that saw Pastor score his first stoppage, a fourth round knockout of another veteran, the 11-29-10 Frank LoBianco, at the Dyckman Oval, in New York City on June 12, 1935. Pastor fought at Yankee Stadium on September 24 of that year, outpointing the 21-20-2 Terry Mitchell over four rounds. On November 1, in a fight featuring two undefeated prospects, Pastor, by then 7-0 with 1 knockout win, faced Max Marek, who had a record of 5-0 with 2 knockouts. This bout marked Pastor's first fight as a professional boxer at the Madison Square Garden. Pastor improved to 8-0 by outpointing Marek over 6 rounds. 28 days later, Pastor received the first blemish on his record, a six round draw against Eddie Sims, who had a record of 23-15-1 coming into their bout. The fight with Sims was followed by an encounter with ranked contender Steve Dudas who had a record of 36-7. The fight occurred on January 17, 1936, at the Madison Square Garden. Dudas won the fight by an eight round decision, handing Pastor his first professional defeat. A draw against the 31-5-2 Al Delaney came after that, and then a rematch with Dudas in which Pastor avenged his earlier defeat by outpointing Dudas over 6 rounds on March 13 at the Madison Square Garden. Pastor's next fight was highly unusual in that his opponent, the 11-12-1 Art Sykes, suffered a nervous breakdown before their bout. Sykes returned to his hotel and had to be persuaded to return to the arena for the fight.http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=10529&cat;=boxer Sykes became disinterested in fighting and leapt out of the ring in round six, quitting and officially giving Pastor his second knockout win. A win over Terry Mitchell in a rematch came after the fight with Sykes, followed by wins against Frankie Sims and a victory over Ralph Barbara in a bout fought at St. Nicholas Arena in New York. These wins were followed by a rubber-match victory by six round decision over Dudas, on June 19, 1936, at Yankee Stadium. Pastor then took on the 31-15-14 John Andersson, on July 7, 1936. This fight was significant in that it marked the first time Pastor boxed outside New York state as a professional. The bout was held at the Braddock Bowl, Jersey City, New Jersey, and Pastor came out on top with a fourth round technical knockout. On August 1, 1936, Pastor fought a boxer named Unknown Winston, at the Walnut Beach Stadium in Milford, Connecticut. The October, 1936 issue of Ring Magazine stated that Winston had fought Lou Poster on the day of the fight, not Bob Pastor, and that the fight had been held on August 12 instead first. The magazine later corrected that information in its next issue, clarifying that it was Pastor, not Poster, who faced Winston and that the fight had been held on August 1. Pastor won the fight by a ten round decision.http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=10529&cat;=boxer Pastor followed the victory over Winston with a win over Billy Ketchell, and three wins over mediocre opposition, whose combined records totaled 20 wins, 36 losses and 6 draws, before facing Ray Impelletiere. Impelletiere had an unimpressive record of 10-6, but held the USA New York State's Heavyweight title. Pastor won the regional belt when he dropped Impelletiere twice before stopping him in round seven, on December 18, 1936 at the Madison Square Garden. With that, Pastor was set to face upcoming star Joe Louis, who had a record of 29-1 at the time. First fight with Joe Louis Joe Louis was rapidly becoming known as a serious contender with a powerful punch when he and Pastor faced each other January 29, 1937. He had scored 25 knockout wins in 30 fights, his lone defeat so far coming in his first fight with former world heavyweight champion Max Schmeling. The first encounter between Pastor and Louis was held at the Madison Square Garden with Arthur Donovan Sr. as referee. Despite taking a beating, Pastor was not floored by the young contender and he lasted the ten round distance, losing by unanimous decision. After that fight, Pastor made his West Coast debut on May 28 when he met the undefeated 12-0 Bob Nestell at the Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, California. Nestell dropped Pastor in round one, and Pastor dropped him in rounds one and three en route to a 10 round points win for Pastor. In his next fight, Pastor lost to the 28-4-3 Nathan Mann by unanimous 10 round decision at the Madison Square Garden, on November 26, 1937. After a relatively restful 1937, Pastor began 1938 with four fights in less than thirty days, beating Hans Havlicek by technical knockout in 8 on January 17, Buck Tracy by technical knockout in 2 on the 24th, Buck Everett on points in 10 on January 31, and then ranked contender Al Ettore by 10 round unanimous decision on February 7. Pastor then faced Lou Nova on April 22, in San Francisco, California. Nova entered the fight with an undefeated record of 16-0-3, and emerged with his undefeated streak still intact after the two men fought to a ten round draw. On May 10, back in Los Angeles, Pastor made his Olympic Auditorium debut, defeating contender Lee Ramage by a ninth round technical knockout when Ramage's manager Pop Foster threw in the towel, signifying their surrender. Pastor knocked out the 24-6-1 Chuck Crowell in the first round and then faced Al McCoy, a hard- punching fighter who had once been recognized as world Light-Heavyweight champion by the Montreal Athletic Commission. Pastor outpointed McCoy over ten rounds on June 20, 1938 and ten days later, he outpointed Freddie Fiducia. On August 5, Pastor fought former world Light-Heavyweight champion Maxie Rosenbloom, whose career was drawing to a close. Rosenbloom and Pastor fought to a ten round draw at Los Angeles' Gilmore Stadium, in Rosenbloom's second to last fight. After wins over Big Bob Brackey and Mickey Duggan, Pastor fought with the 36-4 contender Gus Dorazio, at the Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on December 12, losing by a split decision. One judge scored the fight 5-4-1 in rounds for Dorazio, another scored it for Pastor by the same margin, and the third and deciding judge scored it 4-4-2, but had Dorazio ahead on points using a supplemental scoring system. Rematch with Louis for world Heavyweight title Pastor built a six fight winning streak after losing to Dorazio. Every victory during that streak was on points over ten rounds, including a rematch with McCoy, a fight against Maurice Strickland in which Pastor's trunks fell to the floor at least twice during round six,http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=10529&cat;=boxer and a rematch with Freddie Fiducia. Louis had already established himself as a dominant world heavyweight champion by the time he faced Pastor for the second time, having won the title from James J. Braddock and successfully defended it with a fifteen round unanimous decision over Tommy Farr, and knockouts of Nathan Mann in the third, Harry Thomas in the fifth, Max Schmeling, John Henry Lewis and Jack Roper in the first and Tony Galento in the fourth. 32,199 paying ticket holders and a further 1,669 non-paying spectators got to see the fight live, at Detroit's Briggs Stadium on September 20, 1939.http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:19824 Once again, Pastor gave Louis a hard fight, but he was dropped four times in round one and once in the second round before succumbing to the champion via a knockout 38 seconds into the eleventh round. Pastor returned to the boxing ring on December 15 of that year to face the 42-5-2 Buddy Scott at Dallas, Texas, winning the fight by a ten round decision. He then took six months off before returning on June 28, 1940 to fight the 20-12-5 Charlie Eagle at the Broadway Auditorium in Buffalo, New York, outpointing him, over ten rounds. Match with Billy Conn Billy Conn was the National Boxing Association and New York State Athletic Commission's world light heavyweight champion when Pastor faced him on September 6, 1940, in a highly anticipated bout fought at the Madison Square Garden. Pastor was knocked down by Conn, who was making an attempt at obtaining a shot at Louis for the world heavyweight title, as the bell ended round nine, once again in round twelve and was finally counted out by referee Bill Cavanaugh after receiving a left hook to the body in the thirteenth round.http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:17499 A sixth round technical knockout over mediocre 8-15-2 Mike Alfano was followed by a points victory in ten rounds over the 25-2 Turkey Thompson. On June 16, 1941, Pastor fought a rematch against Buddy Scott, where an audience of only 2,500 paying customers witnessed Pastor once again outpoint Scott over ten rounds at Griffith Stadium, Washington, D.C.. Pastor then returned to Los Angeles for a rematch with Turkey Thompson, again prevailing on points with referee and sole judge Abe Roth scoring the bout 7-2-1 in rounds for Pastor.http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:45014 October 28, 1941, marked the first time Pastor boxed abroad as a professional, facing old rival Al Delaney, whom Pastor had tied with in his eleventh fight as a professional boxer, at the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This time, he dropped Delaney five times before scoring a sixth round technical knockout.http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=10529&cat;=boxer On November 7 of that year, he met the 16-0 undefeated prospect Booker Beckwith. Pastor almost scored a knockout victory when he dropped Beckwith for a nine- second count in round six, but Beckwith got up and finished the bout on his feet. Pastor nevertheless scored a ten round unanimous decision win. Pastor's next bout was on December 12, against the 31-13-1 Jim Robinson, at the Mechanics Building in Boston. In this fight, Pastor dropped his opponent four times to score a first round knockout. Robinson was a late substitute for Jack Marshall, whose military obligations did not let him face Pastor that night. On January 30, 1942, Pastor faced world Light-Heavyweight champion Gus Lesnevich, who like Conn, was recognized as light heavyweight champion by the National Boxing Association and the New York State Athletic Commission, and who was also trying his luck as a heavyweight. Pastor defeated Lesnevich over ten rounds by unanimous decision, at the Madison Square Garden. Lesnevich would later gain universal recognition as world Light-heavyweight champion by knocking out British boxer Freddie Mills.http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:82224 A knockout in eight rounds against the 29-5-1 Lem Franklin at the Arena, in Cleveland, Ohio, set Pastor up for a fight with Jimmy Bivins on April 17, also at the Arena in Cleveland. Despite being dropped twice in round one, Pastor recovered and won the fight by a ten round split decision. Then, on May 22, Pastor faced Tami Mauriello, drawing with Mauriello over ten rounds in front of a crowd of 12,000 at the Madison Square Garden.http://boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:82224 On September 25 he defeated Buddy Scott for a third time, by points after ten rounds, at the Olympia Stadium in Detroit. Last fight Pastor's next fight turned out to be his last. On October 20, he faced Jimmy Bivins at the Arena in Cleveland for a second time. This time Pastor lost by split decision, retiring shortly afterwards. Pastor compiled a record of 53 wins, 7 losses and 5 draws, with 17 wins coming by way of knockouts. He achieved this record in only 7 years of fighting as a professional boxer, a relatively short amount of time in which to accumulate 65 professional bouts. Wrong Pastor During a visit to Arizona in 1992 as part of the 1992 United States Presidential campaign, Henry Cisneros, a confessed boxing fan, mistakenly introduced Ed Pastor as \\"Bob\\" to a donation-dinner crowd. This was a highly publicized mistake on Cisneros' part.

Description  It has a convex edge and concave back broadening towards the tip so that the center of gravity lies at the point. The edge curves in a faint curve towards the tip. The blade usually has one or more broken hollow sections and no midrib. They are usually not decorated. In some versions, a nose-shaped projection is forged to the blade, which is seated on the cutting edge. This projection serves as a kind of parry and finger guard is called Kundieng. It is typical of these swords. Below the finger guard of the blade is rectangular. This place is called Sangau. Between the finger guard and the hilt is called Temporian.

He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off break bowler. He made his debut for Nepal against Bahrain in November 2009. He represents the Nepal Army Club of the National League, Jagdamba Giants of the Nepal Premier League and Pentagon International College, which plays in the SPA Cup.  Playing career  After making his debut for Nepal in the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup, he was in the squad for the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China under then-coach Roy Dias but didn‚Äôt play a single match in the tournament. After the departure of Dias, Naresh missed to be a part of Nepal's glorious years of cricket under new coach Pubudu Dassanayake before finally making a comeback in the team for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. Budhayer had other chances come his way but has never had the opportunity to carry his team to a victory. During the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, Budhayer was included in the Nepal team that went to Bermuda in place of Gyanendra Malla, whose tour was uncertain due to some VISA issues. Budhayer made the trip to Bermuda but didn't get to play a single match for Nepal; what he did experience was the environment of the dressing room and the experience of touring with the national squad. Budhayer was the highest run scorer for Nepal during the U-19 World Cup selection tournament where he scored 232 runs altogether and Budhayer also proved his potential during the 2011 ACC Under-19 Elite Cup where he remained not out in the entire series besides final and scored a total of 121 runs at an average of 121. Budhayer‚Äôs name became popular among the growing Nepali cricket fan base after he made a peculiar record of scoring a century against New Zealand during the 2012 U-19 World Cup warm-up match, and he has made good contributions for Nepal in the age divisions. Naresh was awarded Player of the Series award in the 2013 SPA Cup. He scored 123 runs in four matches at an average of 41.00 and took seven wickets at the economy of 6.17. Later Budhayer, along with another Nepalese youngster Rajesh Pulami, was selected by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to train in its special youth program in England. While both players completed the scholarship programme that provided batting training and match exposure, Naresh stayed back further for one month and involved himself in the third tier cricket of England. Budhayer represented Nepal in the 2014 ACC Premier League where he opened the batting of Nepal along with Subash Khakurel. He also opened Nepal's batting in the 2014 ICC World Cricket League Division Three, where he scored 198 runs, including two fifties, in seven innings at an average of 33.00. Budhayer doesn't like to lose his wicket and prefers to stay unbeaten and carry on till the end, which is evident in his statistics during the 2011 ACC Under-19 Elite Cup where he scored 121 runs at an average of 121. Also, his patient century against New Zealand during the 2012 U-19 World Cup practice match is another innings that showcases Budhayer's talent.

Zero Dimension Neptunia Z: Twilight of the Desperate CPU With the era of peace continuing throughout the world of Gamindustri, Neptune, the ruling Console Patron Unit (CPU) and Nepgear, her sister and CPU Candidate of the nation of Planeptune resume their lives of laziness despite warnings from their Oracle, Histoire. She warns them that the world is entering the 'CPU Shift Period', where the public will attempt to discredit and oust their CPUs in favor of newcomers. However, before Neptune and Nepgear can prepare properly, they stumble across an old video game console which, when activated, transports the pair to an alternate dimension; the Zero Dimension. Upon discovering this new dimension is a ruined wasteland inhabited only by monsters, the two are surprised to find a survivor, Uzume Tennouboshi, who is also a CPU. Neptune and Nepgear learn that, like Uzume, they are unable to transform to unlock their true powers in this world due to the absence of Shares (faith from the people) and so the trio journey across the land to locate fragments of power known as Share Crystals which they use to empower themselves enough to reclaim the land from the invading monster hoard. Neptune and Nepgear learn from Umio, Uzume's sentient fish-monster friend, that Uzume has unique abilities that may trigger when the party needs them most. She is also an amnesiac who remembers nothing of her people or the calamity which destroyed her world but believes it to be the work of a giant known as Dark Purple. Uzume's abilities soon begin to benefit the party by granting them Shares from friendly monsters, food, and finally the ability to seal Dark Purple in a pocket dimension; the Sharing Field, where the party are able to defeat her. Nepgear begins repairs on a transportation device to send herself and Neptune home but the facility is attacked by Arfoire; a powerful CPU-like being with a lust for destruction. Neptune was successfully transported home, but Nepgear, out of reflex, jumped out to help save Uzume from Arfoire's forces. This led the two to abandon their post and retreat. Back home, Neptune finds Histoire incapacitated due to her being an artificial life-form who overloaded as a result of her linking the two dimensions to bring Neptune home. With intel from the other CPUs, Neptune sets out to find an ancient artifact belonging to the original CPU of Planeptune which can reboot and upgrade Histoire. Neptune acquires the artifact from a hidden dungeon and begins to restore Histoire, hoping she can bring Nepgear home. Meanwhile, in the Zero Dimension, Nepgear and Uzume attempt to regroup at Uzume's base but are intercepted by Arfoire. Fortunately, the two are able to defeat and capture her with assistance from an alternate, older Neptune. The older Neptune reveals that she is a dimension traveler who comes from a Planeptune under the rule of Plutia (a close friend from the previous game, who rules in another dimension, the Ultra Dimension) who came to the Zero Dimension with the power of Croire (a dimension-crossing antagonist, also from the previous game) after capturing her, though Croire has since escaped. Arfoire manages to escape by manipulating the party and tracks down Croire, resulting in a formidable new alliance. The party are unable to defeat Arfoire who has stolen power from Croire to boost her own, but successfully recaptures Croire. With her enhanced abilities, Arfoire frees Dark Purple from the pocket dimension and fuses with it, though the party are able to re-confine the fused deity by boosting Uzume's powers with Planeptune's shares, creating a cross-dimensional portal in the process. Neptune rejoins the party through the portal and aids the group in destroying the giant deity, though the portal's temperamental nature causes Neptune and Nepgear to return home after the battle, and a heartwarming farewell to their new friend Uzume. Uzume and Umio plan to rebuild their world, though the older Neptune's fate is left uncertain. Hyperdimension Neptunia G: The Golden Leaders, Reconstructors of Gamindustri Several days later, the CPUs hold a meeting to discuss the CPU Shift Period which is now in full effect. Vicious slander pollutes the media and internet regarding the CPUs, resulting in Shares disappearing at an alarming rate. The CPUs agree to work together to unite Gamindustri and regain public faith by hosting a week-long festival. The festival proves largely successful until the final day when the CPUs hold a friendly battle tournament. The tournament is interrupted by a mysterious 4-person group known as Gold Third who challenges and swiftly defeats the CPUs. After their humiliating defeat, the world is engulfed in an ominous white light. The CPUs awaken several days later in their respective nations, only to find that the public have forgotten them and each of the four members of Gold Third now rule the four nations. The CPUs each return to their respective Basilicoms (CPU Headquarters) followed by the CPU candidates to assess each nation's situation. Though they attempt to keep in contact by cell-phone, networks prove unstable. Vicious new monsters have also been reported throughout Gamindustri, as well as four mysterious golden towers. Neptune: Neptune reunites with her old friend IF; a guild agent, and follows her on a mission investigating a mysterious new crime syndicate known as AffimaX. IF attempts to abandon Neptune having forgotten her entirely, though her memories return when Neptune rescues her from Arfoire who is revealed to have survived and escaped from the Zero Dimension. The two friends defeat Arfoire, however she is rescued by Steamax; a cyborg ninja from AffimaX. The two return to Planeptune as a handful of citizens regain their memories, including Neptune's other friend Compa; a local nurse. The three head to the Basilicom where Histoire welcomes them home and reveals that B-Sha from Gold Third is an even lazier leader than Neptune, and is also afraid of monsters. Histoire suggests Neptune and B-Sha rule Planeptune together, with B-Sha policing the city and Neptune slaying the growing number of monsters outside. Later, the party capture the mouse-mascot Warechu; an AffimaX thief and video-game pirate, who is interrogated for information on AffimaX. In an effort to woo Compa, Warechu reveals the names of several AffimaX members, including himself, Arfoire, Steamax and their leader, the capitalist General Affimojas. Steamax infiltrates the Basilicom, frees Warechu and steals Neptune's dimension-crossing console (assumed to be a Dreamcast). The party chase after and defeat Steamax, but are forced to join forces with him to stop a brainwashed Warechu and B-Sha who are attacking Planeptune, though Steamax escapes with the Dreamcast after the battle. Noire: Noire returns to Lastation with her sister Uni only to find she is a wanted criminal. Noire is forced to leave Uni behind and run from her pursuers until she collapses from exhaustion at the capital. Fortunately, Noire is rescued and nursed back to health by a girl named K-Sha. The two become best friends and K-Sha reveals Lastation's Gold Third leader resigned and a corrupt mercenary group called The Order is now in charge of Lastation. Noire tries to aid Lastation by defeating the new monsters which are attacking civilians but risks capture by being in the public eye. Eventually, Noire is tracked to K-Sha's location and K-Sha is interrogated to reveal Noire's whereabouts. Noire surrenders to save her friend, though Uni soon arrives and breaks Noire out of jail. The two return to K-Sha, who becomes increasingly jealous of Noire's close relationship with her sister. Steamax, under the name 'Jiro', meets Uni for the first time and takes a liking to her. After a mysterious voice persuades K-Sha to remove Uni from their relationship, K-Sha challenges Uni to a fight to the death at the golden tower, with Noire being the prize. At the tower, K-Sha reveals the truth that she is Lastation's Gold Third member and is also in love with Noire. Noire takes Uni's place in the dual to spare Uni and wins, sparing K-Sha, resulting in the two agreeing to be friends. Later, the tower is attacked by The Order, hoping to cut off K-Sha's power source; the crystal on the top floor. The three defeat the order but Uni is poisoned by a chemical weapon. K-Sha saves Uni's life by creating a vaccine from her own blood, but turns hostile again afterwards and is defeated once again. Realizing her power is driving her insane, K-Sha destroys the crystal herself and the three agree to try being friends again. Blanc: In Lowee, Blanc is rescued from a monster by C-Sha of Gold Third. C-Sha claims she has no memory of their prior battle and tells Blanc about the harsh class system in Lowee and the restrictive travel and employment laws. Blanc joins C-Sha and becomes a hunter and helps the struggling citizens whilst searching the land for her sisters, Ram and Rom. C-Sha is approached by a politician named Azna=Leb and tasked with assassinating Blanc, but she refuses. After reuniting with Rom and Ram on a rescue mission, Blanc is approached by Azna=Leb and tasked with investigating C-Sha following troubling allegations against her. Blanc questions her friend and C-Sha apologetically reveals the truth, that she is the Gold Third leader of Lowee and is the source of the monster outbreak as her powers randomly release an uncontrollable red mist which summons monsters against her will. C-Sha is arrested by Azna=Leb's agents despite Blanc's protests of her innocence. C-Sha is sentenced to execution but releases the red mist which summons an army of monsters to attack Lowee, allowing her to escape with help from her friend Financier. Ram and Rom evacuate the citizens whilst Blanc attempts to stop the monsters alone. When all hope seems lost, Financier arrives with reinforcements in the form of Ram, Rom, C-Sha and the Hunters Guild. After liberating Lowee, C-Sha reclaims her position of ruler and arrests Azna=Leb who she left in charge in her absence, and then abolishes the harsh laws and class system which he set in place. Afterwards, C-Sha climbs her golden tower and destroys the crystal at the top to remove her powers and the red mist, but instead becomes possessed by the mist. After Blanc, Ram and Rom defeat her, the four return to their duties in Lowee. Vert: Vert, the CPU of Leanbox, returns home to learn from the new leader, S-Sha of Gold Third, that Leanbox is under attack by outside invaders as well as an army of demons. Vert immediately joins the military in order to save Leanbox and is sent to the front lines where she learns that Leanbox's entire army has been wiped out by a curse that turns them into pigs. After defeating an outside invader; a battle robot believed to be from Lastation, Vert is dispatched to defeat another invader but instead encounters Nepgear who offers her support. Together, the two defeat another battle robot which Nepgear reveals that whilst it was made from Lastation parts, it was actually built within Leanbox. The two return to S-Sha to suggest an internal rebellion but S-Sha cold- shoulders them. Later, Vert is contacted by a woman named E-Sha who begs her to stop S-Sha's scheme. S-Sha promises to return Leanbox to Vert after they defeat the demon king, but she disappears soon after the mission is accomplished. The party follow her to Leanbox's golden tower which is revealed to be the source of her power. The party battles through S-Sha's allies, including older Neptune who reveals she has joined AffimaX. E-Sha manifests as an alternate personality within S-Sha's body which S-Sha intends to create a new vessel for by sacrificing a million cursed Leanbox citizens. Older Neptune causes the ritual to fail by misplacing a pig and the party is able to convince S-Sha to live in harmony with E-Sha after defeating her in battle. Finale: With the nations now at peace, Neptune journeys with IF and Compa to reunite the CPUs. After recruiting Nepgear, Vert, Noire, Uni, Blanc, Ram and Rom, the party return to Planeptune to plan their next move against AffimaX. The party learn the location of AffimaX's base of operations; an aerial fortress, which they successfully infiltrate. AffimaX, however, is disbanded, as Affimojas refuses to hand the Dreamcast over to Arfoire, resulting in her leaving with older Neptune. Affimojas also dismisses Steamax having learned of his feelings for Uni, though Steamax stays behind to defend his oldest friend from the CPUs, but is inevitably defeated. Affimojas is able to fend off the CPUs but is then defeated by them when they transform into their 'Next Form'; a new power given to them by Gold Third. Heartdimension Neptunia H: Trilogy Finale: Into Legend After returning to Planeptune with Affimojas and Steamax in tow, a giant wormhole opens above Gamindustri. The four CPUs manage to safely explore the wormhole by navigating an extra-dimensional maze, followed from a distance by a worried Nepgear and Uni. After noticing an incoming monster hoard which Neptune recognizes from Zero Dimension, she stops their advance by destroying the passageway with an explosive. Suddenly, Uzume appears and summons Dark Purple, who then abducts the four CPUs. Nepgear and Uni witness the event and return to Histoire to plan a rescue mission. Histoire reveals that the CPUs were taken to the Zero Dimension but the party should be able to follow by using the Dreamcast since the passageway was destroyed earlier. After sparring with Nepgear, Uni, Ram, Rom, Compa and IF, the four members of Gold Third agree to join the rescue mission. In Zero Dimension, the party interrogate Uzume who denies any knowledge of abducting the CPUs and joins the party to aid in the investigation. Umio reports an anomaly to the northeast where the party find Uzume's doppelganger who reveals her plan to fuse the Zero Dimension and the Hyper Dimension (Neptune's reality) by using her four golden towers as an anchor point, which would plunge the new world into ruin and despair. She then escapes to a third dimension; Heart Dimension, by opening a portal. The party follow her through the portal where they find a fragmented world made from memories and dreams. Nepgear, Uni and Uzume leave the party to rest whilst they explore the area and rescue older Neptune from Arfoire, and destroy her once and for all. Older Neptune reveals she was a double-agent who joined AffimaX to aid the party from the shadows by stopping S-Sha's ritual and leaving the doppelganger's portal open. The doppelganger, who older Neptune refers to a 'Kurome', ordered Arfoire to kill her after learning the truth. With older Neptune back in the party, the group explores Heart Dimension and learn that Kurome has the power to induce both nightmares and false happiness, which she is using to corrupt the CPUs like she did previously to Affimojas and Gold Third. She also partially re-wrote the timeline to make the public forget, and thus weaken, the CPUs, but newly acquired Shares are cancelling its effects. The party witness the CPUs' fantasies; with Neptune wanting praise and her nation's happiness, Noire wanting to be a successful voice-actress and socialite, Blanc wanting large breasts and Vert wanting younger sisters who are actually clones of herself. The party track down Kurome, who reveals she is a spirit of the real Uzume; an old CPU of Planeptune who volunteered to be sealed in Heart Dimension by Histoire after unintentionally harming her people having failed to control her powers. There, she came to resent humankind who shunned her and became a wandering spirit, whilst a fragment of her power; her conscience, took on a new life in the connected Zero Dimension, as the new Uzume. Kurome then unleashes the corrupted CPUs on the party who attempt to kill their own sisters but, after an intense battle, Uzume succeeds in cancelling out Kurome's mind-controlling negative energy with Share energy. Kurome reveals that Uzume's growing power also increases her own, allowing her to physically manifest in the Hyper Dimension, leaving the party to battle her latest giant; Dark Green, who they successfully manage to destroy, along with several CPU clones. A flashback reveals that Umio is a reincarnation of the old Uzume's lover, though he retains no memories of this. The CPU candidates and Gold Third follow Kurome to Hyper Dimension whilst the CPUs, IF, Compa and older Neptune remain in Heart Dimension where they attempt to defeat Kurome by destroying her 'heart' with Share energy. Croire intervenes and summons Dark White to destroy the CPUs, though the party emerges victorious and re-captures Croire. The Hyper Dimension party are attacked by Kurome in an attempt to seize the Dreamcast, which she reveals contains another fragment of Uzume's soul, though the party defeat Kurome's Dark Black CPU and chase Kurome back to the Heart Dimension. There, the two parties regroup to attack Kurome head-on, though Kurome fuses with all four Dark CPUs to become Dark Orange; the ultimate Dark CPU, who is now powerful enough to disable Uzume's Sharing Field. Uzume is able to reopen the Sharing Field by draining power from the original Share Crystal; her and Kurome's life-force. The party successfully destroy Dark Orange in the Sharing Field, though Kurome orders her monsters to destroy Hyper Dimension before disappearing. With Hyper Dimension facing annihilation, Uzume orders Nepgear and Neptune to destroy the original Share Crystal, which will erase herself, Kurome, Zero/Heart Dimension and the monster hoard. With no alternative, Neptune and Nepgear comply to save their world. Uzume buys the party enough time to evacuate themselves and the friendly monsters, including Umio, back to Hyper Dimension. Ascension Ending (Normal Ending) Zero/Heart Dimension disappears and the party return home with heavy hearts. Post credits scenes reveal that the monster hoard never reached Hyper Dimension. Later, Neptune and Nepgear are visited by Uzume's spirit, who promises to always watch over them. This ending was removed from VIIR. Revival Ending (True Ending) After Zero/Heart Dimension disappears and the party return home, Histoire reveals that Uzume can be revived with share energy, but there's a chance that Kurome will be revived instead. During the revival process, the two CPUs struggle to decide whom will be revived. Uzume emerges victorious and was revived, while Zero/Heart Dimension are restored.

The game is produced by Naoko Mizuno, alongside director Shingo Onodera and character artist Tsunako.2014-07-18, Compile Heart Teases Neptunia VII Game's Plot in 3rd Promo Video, Anime News Network. As part of a promotional collaboration with Makai Shin Trillion, costume DLC for the outfits of Makai Shin Trillion characters will be released for the game on July 23, 2015.Dengeki PlayStation volume 594 (23 July 2015 issue), page 62-63. VIIR On March 12, 2017, Compile Heart revealed Megadimension Neptunia VIIR (pronounced as \\"V2-R\\") for the PlayStation 4, a remake of the game that changes the battle system and adds PlayStation VR functionality. The remake also uses Silicon Studio's OROCHI 4 game engine and MIZUCHI rendering engine. It was released in Japan on August 24, 2017, in North America on May 8, 2018, and in Europe on May 11, 2018. The Windows version was released via Steam on October 22, 2018, with HTC Vive and Oculus Rift functionality. The story of the remake takes place after the original game where Histoire expresses gratitude to the player for helping with the events that took place in the original game. Events of the original game were made into a \\"game\\" by Histoire as a way for the player to \\"experience\\" the events again. The remake's story happens as a retelling of the events of the original game up to its true ending and thus removes the multiple ending and some events are slightly altered to make the story progression easier. In addition to the story are the VR events that can be unlocked where the main four goddesses visit the player and spends time talking about themselves. The player will sometimes be given choices that will slightly affect the conversation. Another form of VR events happens during the main story as the adult version Neptune visits the player. However, unlike the unlockable VR events that happened after the main story, these ones are implied to happened while the player was supposedly playing the original game's story. Unlike the Re;Birth trilogy of remakes, DLC characters from the original game are absent in VIIR. Additionally, due to the complications with the SAG Contract, Erin Fitzgerald's lines as Noire are redubbed and replaced by Erica Mendez in the English dub, although Fitzgerald's voice work as Dark Black was not replaced. Reception Megadimension Neptunia VII has received mixed reviews from critics, scoring 71/100 on Metacritic. The game received a review score of 32/40 by Famitsu. Marcus Estrada of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 3 out of 5 saying, \\"Megadimension Neptunia VII is slightly refreshing, but not enough to really revitalize this aging series.\\" CJ Andriessen from Destructoid rated the game a 6.5/10 saying, \\"Megadimension Neptunia VII opts not to use its transition to the new hardware as a reason to try and expand its audience beyond the current player base.\\" The game sold 22,609 physical retail copies within its debut week of release in Japan.

Under the agreement, the Islamic separatists would turn over their firearms to a third party, which would be selected by the rebels and the Philippine government. The MILF agreed to decommission its armed wing, the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF). In return, the government would establish an autonomous Bangsamoro. Power sharing was a central point to the autonomy redesign. The current ARMM charter lists 14 areas that are outside the powers of the regional legislature. In this comprehensive peace agreement, the parties lists 81 powers categorized into reserved for the central government, exclusive to the Bangsamoro, and concurrent with or shared by the two sides for power sharing. Of the 81 powers, 58 are devolved to the Bangsamoro, nine are reserved to the central government, and 14 are shared. The Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro and Four annexes, namely on Transitional Arrangements and Modalities, Revenue Generation and Wealth Sharing, Power Sharing and Normalization, together with the Addendum on Bangsamoro Waters, will be included in the comprehensive agreement. The Armed Forces of the Philippines has raised red alert status on March 24 in preparation for the event. Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, MILF chair Hadji Murad Ibrahim, and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak are among the key people expected to be present at the signing of the agreement. Background In pursuit of their goal of liberating Bangsamoro, the MNLF engaged the government forces in extensive armed collisions, peaking in the early 70s when the rebels‚Äô blitz-like operations brought them control of a substantial number of municipalities surrounding Cotabato City and its airport complex. This prompted the Marcos regime to beef up military presence by deploying almost three-fourths of the army in most Muslim parts of Mindanao. Things took a different turn in 1976 when Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi brokered an agreement that led to the signing of the Tripoli Agreement, introducing the concept of an autonomous Muslim region in Mindanao. On August 1, 1989, under the mandate of the new 1987 Constitution, Congress enacted Republic Act 6734, authorizing the creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). However, out of the 13 provinces and 9 cities that participated in the plebiscite, only the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, and Tawi- Tawi opted to become part of the ARMM. The ARMM was formally established on November 6, 1990. Instead of bringing the Muslim leaders together, this agreement further fragmented the MNLF, because some factions within the group preferred independence over autonomy. Thus, a group of officers led by Hashim Salamat broke away and formed the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to continue their armed struggle for an independent Bangsamoro (Moro nation) in Mindanao. Though the combined strength of these two rebel forces has not reached a point of posing any real threat to the government in Manila, their existence‚Äîand the reasons for their resilience‚Äîcertainly brings many headaches for the government. For nearly five decades, five presidents have tried to completely end these two rebellions, utilizing both force and diplomacy. So far, no combination has succeeded. Perhaps the most remarkable effort to bring closure to these movements was that of the Ramos Administration, which tried to reach out to both the communist and Muslim rebels through peaceful means. There were many efforts to reach peace with Islamist separatists. Framework Agreement On October 15, 2012, the Philippine government signed a much-hyped document touted as the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro, which culminated the Aquino Administration's effort to end the deadlock in the peace process. This new document, while merely providing for a general framework for the actual peace negotiations, announced that \\"the status quo is unacceptable and that the Bangsamoro shall be established to replace the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The Bangsamoro was the new autonomous political entity (NPE) referred to in the Decision Points of Principles as of April 2012.\\" According to President Aquino, this was the agreement that could \\"finally seal genuine, lasting peace in Mindanao.\\" with Bangsamoro replacing ARMM which was described by President Benigno Aquino III as \\"a failed experiment\\". Reaching the agreement The peace talks between the MILF and the Philippine government had been brokered by Malaysia since 1997. After 2009, the negotiations were also supported by an International Contact Group (the ICG). The ICG represented an innovation in peace process support, in that it was a hybrid body composed of both states and international non-governmental organisations (INGOs). The members were Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and Japan, The Asia Foundation, the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, Muhammadiyah, and Conciliation Resources. When the Asia Foundation became an official member of the Third Party Monitoring Team in 2012, the Community of San‚ÄôEgidio from Italy replaced the Asia Foundation in the ICG. On January 24, 2014, Philippine government chief negotiator Miriam Coronel Ferer and MILF chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal signed a peace agreement in Kuala Lumpur. The agreement would pave the way for the creation of the new Muslim autonomous entity called \\"Bangsamoro\\" under a law to be approved by the Philippine Congress. The government aims to set up the region by 2016. The agreement calls for Muslim self-rule in parts of the southern Philippines in exchange for a deactivation of rebel forces by the MILF. MILF forces would turn over their firearms to a third party to selected by the MILF and the Philippine government. A regional police force would be established, and the Philippine military would reduce the presence of troops and help disband private armies in the area. In the Agreement, the government committed to change a 37-year autonomy experiment whose current version, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), has failed to live up to the Moro people‚Äôs aspiration for freedom from a highly centralized government.

It was established in 2004 on land previously part of the Lincoln National Park. The protection area contains significant sites of natural, indigenous and early European heritage. Extent The wilderness protection area occupies the south east tip of Jussieu Peninsula on Eyre Peninsula and the following islands - Hopkins, Little, Lewis and Smith in Spencer Gulf and Williams in the Great Australian Bight down to Mean Low Water Mark. Its extent on Jussieu Peninsula is bounded by the peninsula's coastline as follows: its eastern boundary extends from near Taylor's Landing (a small cove located opposite to Taylor Island) in a southerly direction to Cape Catastrophe, its southern boundary extends from Cape Catastrophe in a westerly direction to West Point and its western boundary consists of the coastline of the east side of Jussieu Bay from West Point in a northerly direction to a point on the coastline approximately west of Memory Cove. The west and north sides of the wilderness protection area adjoin the Lincoln National Park. Origins and history Previously the land was part of the Lincoln National Park and its predecessors since 1941. During the 1980s, the land around Memory Cove was ‚Äòidentified as having some of the highest quality wilderness values in the state‚Äô. In 1992, a locked gate was installed on the road to Memory Cove in order to restrict access in order to minimise disturbance. In 1999, it was proposed to proclaim the area and the following islands - Hopkins, Lewis, Little, Smith and Williams, as a wilderness protection area under the Wilderness Protection Act 1992. On the basis of significant support for the proposal, the area was excised from the park and formally proclaimed as the Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area on 30 September 2004. Prior to being part of a protected area, the land supported the Aboriginal tribes of Barngala and Nauo as well as a small amount of agricultural activity by European settlers. The Memory Cove Tablet Site, which marks one of the few places that Matthew Flinders came ashore in South Australia, lies within the area and is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. Wilderness qualities The following qualities have been identified by the government agency managing the wilderness protection area. Firstly, 180 species of native flora have been recorded within the wilderness protection area including seven species considered to be of conservation significance. Secondly, the area is considered to have significant cultural history in respect to the Barngarla and the Nauo people, who occupied the area prior to European arrival. Thirdly, the event concerning the loss of eight crew from HM Sloop Investigator under the command of Matthew Flinders during February 1802 in the waters adjoining the wilderness protection area is considered to be of historical significance. Visitor services Access is regulated by a locked gate within the adjoining Lincoln National Park. A maximum of 15 vehicles per day is permitted to enter. A camping ground exists at Memory Cove. Yachts and boats can anchor in the sheltered waters available at Memory Cove and Williams Island. Recreational fishing and associated water-based activities take place in the waters adjoining the wilderness protection area.

Their television commercials used the hook from the song by Status Quo of 1979, \\"Whatever You Want\\". In 1990, the Weisfelds sold What Everyone Wants to Amber Day, a company run by Philip Green. After selling, the Weisfelds founded a new discount department store in Glasgow, named Weisfelds, in 1994. Located in the old Goldbergs buildings (Goldbergs having closed in 1990), it had a similar style and range of merchandise to their original WEWW business. However, the venture failed to repeat the success of the original and closed in 1999; the buildings eventually fell into dereliction and were purchased by Selfridges who later sold the site. The 130 store What Everyone Wants chain was sold to Tradegro in August 2002, but went into administration the following month.The Telegraph It underwent numerous change of owners, including Philip Green, before Brown and Jackson took ownership at the end. When Brown and Jackson sold it to Tradegro Daan Venter took on the role as CEO and changed the name to Everyone Wants and used the slogan 'Value, Style and Quality'.

Background The Bangsamoro Transition Commission is a government body created on December 17, 2013 by the virtue of Executive Order 120 signed by President Benigno Aquino III. The commission is tasked to come up with a draft on the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), which would serve as the basis of a new Bangsamoro political entity, in accordance to the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro. Under the executive order, the Bangsamoro Transition Commission was to be disestablished upon the enactment of a Bangsamoro Basic Law.http://www.rappler.com/nation/18123-aquino-signs-eo- on-bangsamoro-transition-commission-amid-technical-impasse The Bangsamoro Basic Law failed to pass during the Aquino administration. Under Aquino's successor, President Rodrigo Duterte amended Executive Order 120 issued by his predecessor through Executive Order No. 8 in 2016 which includes increasing the membership of the BTC. The BBL was later passed into law as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) in 2018 and was ratified through a plebiscite on January 21, 2019. The BTC was to be disestablished upon ratification according to relevant executive orders but continued as a transition body of the new Bangsamoro Autonomous Region by the virtue of Section 5 of Article XVI of the BOL until the constitution of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority. Composition =Under the second Aquino administration= The former commission under the administration of President Benigno Aquino III is composed of 15 members. 8 members including the chairman where chosen by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front while 7 members where chosen by the government. The composition seeks to represent the Christian, Muslim and Indigenous People (IP) communities. = Under the Duterte administration = Pre-BOL ratification The current composition under President Rodrigo Duterte is composed of 21 members, with an additional 6 more members from 15 in the past administration.

He died in Amsterdam in 2002 during a visit to Europe. Works Alan Brunton's work was interwoven between his poetry and theatre. He performed as part of the troupe in Red Mole in many venues including in the 1970s Carmen's Balcony in Wellington, New Zealand. Carmen's Balcony was a notorious nightclub run by Carmen Rupe. His colleague Arthur Baysting was performing there too and says of his work: \\"Alan‚Äôs political eye could be sharp and droll: ‚Äúthe vaudeville king of politics is calling names again on the radio ‚Ä¶ how much gin does He drink in a day?‚Äù (Sally‚Äôs Turn to Talk). On a good night, in the face of drunken calls for the live rock band or topless dancers, he could silence the packed crowds with a tender, softly spoken love song.\\" *Black & White Anthology (1976).

Cast  *Rossana Podest√† as Mary Hunter *Georges Rivi√®re as Max Hunter *Christopher Lee as Erich *Jim Dolen as John Selby, FBI Agent *Lucile St. Simon as Hilde Production The Virgin of Nuremberg was based on an Italian paperback novel La vergine di Normberga, issue #23 in the KKK series of Italian pulp paperback novels. These novels were part of a trend in Italy of cheap paperback novels that blended Gothic, horror and erotic styles. These titles claimed to based on British authors where the real Italian authors were described as translators. The film's producer, Marco Vicario, was the co-founder of the company G.E.I. who published the KKK paperbacks. Margheriti changed elements of the plot of the story to include a war and surgery subplots. The film also removes some of the more extreme elements of the novel, such as a part where a man severs a woman's nerve before pulling out almost all of the bones from her body. The screenwriters of the film assumed pseudonyms. Many sources state that Ernesto Gastaldi was credited as Gastad Green, but he has denied contributing to the film's writing, stating he may have discussed plot elements with Margheriti, but did no actual writing. The official documents relating to the film's production credit Marco Vicario's brother Renato Vicario as Gastad Green. The film was shot after Margheriti's film Castle of Blood was shot in order to exploit its production values. The film was a rushed production and was shot in three weeks.

Born in the Victorian city of Ballarat, she studied under a leading Australian Impressionist, Frederick McCubbin, at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1905 and was an early member of the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors. Following the death of her father in 1907, Rix, her only sibling Elsie and her mother travelled to Europe where she undertook further study, first in London and then Paris. Her teachers during the period included John Hassall, Richard Emil Miller and Th√©ophile Steinlen. After travelling to Tangier in 1912, Rix held several successful exhibitions of her work, with one drawing, Grande march√©, Tanger, purchased by the French government. She was one of the first Australians to paint post-impressionist landscapes, was made a member of the Soci√©t√© des Peintres Orientalistes Fran√ßais, and had works hung in the Paris Salon in 1911 and 1913. The family evacuated from France to England after the outbreak of World War I. A period of personal tragedy followed, as Rix's sister died in 1914, then her mother in 1915. In 1916 she met and married George Matson Nicholas, only to be widowed the next month when he was killed on the Western Front. Returning to Australia in 1918, Rix Nicholas once more took up professional painting, and held an exhibition of over a hundred works at Melbourne's Guild Hall. Many sold, including In Picardy, purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Following a period painting in rural locations in the early 1920s, Rix Nicholas returned to Europe. A 1925 exhibition in Paris led to the sale of her work In Australia to the Mus√©e du Luxembourg, followed by an extensive tour of her paintings around regional British art galleries. Other exhibitions, such as the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, and the Royal Academy of Arts, both in London, soon hosted her work. She was made an Associate of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux- Arts after several of her works were included in its 1926 Spring exhibition in Paris. In 1926, Rix Nicholas returned to Australia, and in 1928 she married Edgar Wright, whom she had met during her travels in the early 1920s. The couple settled at Delegate, New South Wales; their only child, a son named Rix Wright, was born in 1930. Though she continued to paint significant works including The Summer House and The Fair Musterer, Rix Nicholas, a staunch critic of modernism and disdainful of emerging major artists such as Russell Drysdale and William Dobell, grew out of step with trends in Australian art. Her pictures followed a conservative modern style, portraying an Australian pastoral ideal, and reviews of her exhibitions grew more uneven. She held her last solo show in 1947. Rix Nicholas remained at Delegate until her death in 1961. Her works are held in most major Australian collections, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, Australian War Memorial, National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the Queensland Art Gallery. Early life Henry Finch Rix and Elizabeth Sutton, each of whom had migrated to Australia as children with their families, met and married in Victoria in 1876. They had two daughters, Elsie Bertha, born in 1877, and Emily Hilda (known ubiquitously just as Hilda), born in Ballarat on 1 September 1884. The Rix children grew up in a gifted and energetic family. Henry, a mathematics teacher, was appointed a district Inspector of Schools in the 1880s; he was also a poet who wrote in support of Australian Federation, and played Australian rules football for the Carlton Football Club. Elizabeth had grown up assisting in her parents' thriving music business in Ballarat, and was a singer who performed with the Ballarat Harmonic Society. In addition, she had a studio in Melbourne's Flinders Street, and a committee member of the Austral Salon, \\"a meeting place for intellectual women interested in the fine arts.\\" She painted in an academic style, generally choosing still lifes and flowers as subjects, though she painted some large landscapes in the Beechworth region. Self-portrait of Frederick McCubbin, Australian Impressionist painter and Rix Nicholas's first major influence Hilda Rix and her sister Elsie both played musical instruments as children, performing songs and dances at regional shows. Elsie was a singer and actor who performed at the meetings of the Austral Salon, and the sisters collaborated in designing posters for the Salons. As a child, Hilda was enthusiastic about drawing. Her artistic efforts drew praise while she was attending high school at Melbourne Girls Grammar (known as Merton Hall), though in most other respects Rix was not an outstanding student. Both took art lessons with a Mr Mather, before Hilda studied at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1905, where she was taught by a leading Australian Impressionist, Frederick McCubbin. Her fellow students were mostly women and included Jessie Traill, , Ruth Sutherland, Dora Wilson, and Vida Lahey. Rix would subsequently be critical of McCubbin's approach to teaching, referring to his methods as \\"vague persuasions\\". Nevertheless, the author of the only comprehensive biography of Rix, John Pigot, considered that McCubbin influenced her in several ways: he emphasised the creativity of individuals rather than imitating the style of any one school of painting; he modelled the importance of nationalistic ideas and subjects that would become so prominent in her later painting; and his work emphasised the painting's subject over technical considerations. Drawings undertaken by Rix while she was still a student were included in annual exhibitions at the Victorian Artists' Society and the Austral Salon. At the same time, she was working as a professional illustrator for textbooks and a periodical, the School Paper, published by the Victorian Department of Education. In 1903, all of the Rix family women had works included in the Austral Salon's exhibition. One of Rix's early sketchbooks survives and pages from it were reproduced in the 2012 book, In Search of Beauty. Although she described the works as her \\"very earliest drawings when a child in Melbourne\\", the dated pages indicate they were created up until at least the age of twenty. They mostly portray women, and the settings and dress of her subjects reflect the relatively affluent and educated milieu of which the Rix family were part. In this period, it was common for aspiring Australian artists to seek further training in Europe, particularly London and Paris. Henry Rix arranged to take his family there in conjunction with a trip he was making to study British education reforms, purchasing first-class tickets to travel in 1906. But Henry, who had been overworked and ill, died suddenly, and for a time it appeared the trip might not happen. Denied a widow's pension (Henry had been 58: too young for his wife to be eligible), the family had to reorganise their affairs and work out if they could afford to get to Europe. Finally, by combining an inheritance, rental income from their home, and money raised through the sale of works by both mother and daughter, they were able to trade the first class tickets for second class berths, and they set sail for England early in 1907. Europe 1907‚Äì12 Arthur Streeton, as painted by Tom Roberts. Rix followed his advice to study under many different teachers. Just before her departure from Australia, Rix was advised by the painter Arthur Streeton to study with many different masters, as a means of preserving her own originality. Her subsequent career reflected that advice. One of her first teachers was John Hassall, although he had initially protested that she was already a better drawer than himself. Rix thought him \\"simply great\\", and Pigot credits Hassall's simple and direct style with influencing the artist's later practice. Late in 1907, Rix moved with her sister and mother to Paris, where they lived in Montparnasse. There she met with Australian artist E. Phillips Fox, went on sketching expeditions to the Jardin du Luxembourg where Ethel Carrick Fox worked, and became a student at the Acad√©mie Del√©cluse, operated by academic painter Auguste Del√©cluse. She found his guidance in life drawing enormously valuable, though she thought his approach to colour \\"too drab\\". The following year she was taught by American impressionist Richard Emil Miller. From him she acquired the use of a relatively bright colour palette, not always naturalistic, as well as his dextrous technique; she did not, however, follow his predilection for pretty compositions, favouring more direct and clear images. Continuing to acquire skills from a wide range of artists, she next studied at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re, including with Swiss-born illustrator Th√©ophile Steinlen. Rix, her sister and mother, spent summers traveling together. In 1908 they journeyed through France and Italy, and later at the artists' colony at the fishing village of √âtaples, in northern France. Among the artists active there was Frenchman Jules Adler, who took an interest in Rix's work, as well as many Australians, including Rupert Bunny, James Peter Quinn, Edward Officer and one of the colony's longest-term residents, Iso Rae. Around 1909, Hilda Rix met Wim Brat, an architecture student from a wealthy Dutch family. He asked Rix's mother for approval to marry her daughter, and Mrs Rix agreed. An initial engagement turned sour, however, when Rix spent time at her fianc√©'s home, where she found her prospective husband dominated by his mother, who strongly disapproved of the match. Rix reluctantly broke off the engagement. Rix continued to work, and was rewarded with hangings at the Paris Salon in 1911, alongside fellow Australians Arthur Streeton and George Bell. She took up study at Acad√©mie Colarossi at the time Henri Matisse was painting from the academy's models and offering an open studio to its students. At this time she became only the second Australian to have a work acquired by the French government, and is considered by Australian curator Elena Taylor to be, after the established expatriates Bunny and Phillips Fox, \\"without doubt the most successful of the Australian artists in France\\". Moroccan paintings 1912‚Äì14 Detail of Men in the Market Place, Tangier (1914), showing a typical subject of Rix Nicholas's Moroccan work, and her post-impressionist style adopted during this period. Many women artists visited and worked in north Africa in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; Rix twice visited the region, resulting in some of her most significant artistic development and works. She first joined American painter Henry Ossawa Tanner, his wife and a Miss Simpson on a trip to Morocco in January 1912. They travelled via Spain, where Rix viewed the work of Vel√°zquez, whose compositions and palette she greatly admired. The party's destination was Tangier, a place where many other artists had sought inspiration. Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant lived and painted there in the 1870s, while John Singer Sargent visited in the 1880s. Henri Matisse also visited Tangier in 1912 and, like Rix, travelled to T√©touan, about east of Tangier; they used the same models. For about three months, Rix sketched and painted in Tangier, spending time in the open-air market place or soko. Her enthusiasm for the place was evident from her correspondence: > Picture me in this market-place ‚Äì I spend nearly every day there for it > fascinates me completely ‚Äì have done 16 drawings and two oil things so far ‚Äì > Am feeling thoroughly at home now so am going to take out my big oil box ‚Äì > wanted to get used to people and things first ‚Äì Oh how I do love it all! ... > Oh the sun is shining I must out to work. Morocco had a similar effect on Rix as it did on many artists who visited. Paintings were created in high-keyed colours that captured the intense north African light, and most works focussed on the figures, dress and activity of the people, or the local architecture. One interpretation of the perspective of Rix is that she was an orientalist, in the sense used by academic Edward Said. Pigot, in his exhibition essay Capturing the Orient, considered how Rix's works \\"emphasise the exoticism\\" of the locations she portrays. > Representing the Orient through the objective depiction of costumes and > dress maintained the counterfeit truthfulness of orientalist imagery, > concealing the reality of oriental life and the violence that underscored > the colonial project. In Rix Nicholas's imagery costumes embodied the > exoticism of the East and signified its sense of cultural 'otherness'. On the other hand, Hoorn argues that Rix and her sister were to a significant extent counter-orientalist: they focussed on the common nature of human experience rather than cultural expressions of difference and they sought to portray everyday life in Tangier as they found it, rather than presenting generalised views of the orient. Her works similarly reflect a modernist approach to the empirical: in using the bright light of north Africa to help bring out the structures and shapes that made up visual impressions. Hoorn wrote: > She did not seek out or embellish her pictures with the \\"orientalist\\" > stereotypes that she had learned while growing up in Melbourne...In her > writing and painting, she actively campaigned against what she saw as the > fakery of \\"orientalism\\". Her pastel drawings and oils strive to present an > accurate account of the dress, manners and appearance of her subjects. Stylistically, Rix's Moroccan paintings have been characterised as the \\"most abstract, flat and post-impressionistic of her career\\". Rix Nicholas's approach may have been influenced by Matisse: they stayed in the same hotel in Tangier at the same time for nearly two months, travelled to T√©touan during the same week, and may be in a photograph together taken during that trip. She was one of the first Australians to paint post-impressionist landscapes, including Men in the Market Place, Tangier (1914) and View of Tangier (1914), produced during a second visit to the city. They demonstrate the development of her style at the time: loose brush strokes, a palette confined to a few low-keyed colours, and an emphasis on shadow and light, affecting both the overall impression made by the picture and the treatment of individual figures. The 1912 trip represented a landmark in her work, led to several exhibitions and her first significant international critical acclaim. The journeys are the subject of one of the few books about the artist's work, Jeanette Hoorn's Hilda Rix Nicholas and Elsie Rix's Moroccan Idyll: Art and Orientalism. Exhibition of her first works produced immediate results: the French government purchased one of her pictures of the market in Tangier, and in 1913 she again had paintings displayed at the Paris Salon. The purchase by the French government was of a pastel drawing, Grande march√©, Tanger, which she would later copy in oils. The drawing was favourably discussed in the French edition of the New York Herald, but not by one The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer, who complained that \\"the drawing and colour are eccentric, after the post-impressionist manner\\" and described the central figure as \\"grotesque in its want of finish\\". The Herald's reviewer was at odds with prevailing sentiment. Her success was widely reported in Australian papers such as Hobart's Mercury, Melbourne's Argus and Adelaide's Register. In addition to displaying the results of her trip at the Salon, she was invited to exhibit in 1913 and 1914 at the Soci√©t√© des Peintres Orientalistes Fran√ßais, also in Paris. Rix was made a member of the society. In November 1912, there was a solo exhibition at a private gallery, Galerie J Chaine and Simonson. Her work was illustrated in the Notre Gazette, reflecting her emerging status as a significant artist, and the French press reported her exhibitions. She returned to Tangier again in early 1914, this time with her sister Elsie, who also drew and wrote but whose main purpose was to provide her sister with company, assistance and protection from curious onlookers while she painted. Rix painted regularly at the soko, where she would both attract much attention and sometimes disrupt the flow of traffic as she sketched. The sisters returned to England and then to France, where Rix again spent the summer at √âtaples, until the outbreak of World War I resulted in evacuation to London in August. Disaster 1914‚Äì18 Her retreat to London began a tragic period in her life. Rix's mother Elizabeth had been unwell, and deteriorated during the crossing from France to England. Elizabeth was brought to hospital when they landed; though she partially recovered and was moved to a nursing home, her other daughter, Elsie, fell ill with typhoid. Rix moved between her two ailing family members until, on 2 September 1914, Elsie died. For three months she withheld the news from her mother, fearing it would harm her already fragile condition. Elizabeth survived the news, but as the war continued, Rix's artistic output dwindled almost to nothing. Then in March 1916, Elizabeth died. Rix was just over thirty years old, and all her immediate relatives were now dead. Recalling the experience, she later wrote: \\"I could scarcely put one foot in front of the other and walked like an old thing\\". Further misfortune arrived when in France, an Australian officer, Captain George Matson Nicholas, was posted to √âtaples. He heard about the female Australian artist who had to leave her paintings behind when she and her family left abruptly for England. Nicholas sought her works and admired them, and decided to contact the artist when next he was on leave. He met Rix in September 1916, and they were married on 7 October at St Saviour's, Warwick Avenue in London. After three days together, he returned to duty; she was widowed five weeks later on 14 November, when he was shot and killed during battle at Flers, on the Western Front. Initially writing in her diary that she had lost the will to live, Rix Nicholas's grief eventually found its expression in three paintings, titled And Those Who Would Have Been Their Sons, They Gave Their Immortality (a phrase from a poem by Rupert Brooke), Desolation and Pro Humanitate. The second of these paintings (which was destroyed by fire in 1930), portrayed a gaunt and tearful woman shrouded in a black cloak, crouched staring at the viewer amidst a battlescarred landscape, featureless but for the crosses on distant graves. The National Gallery of Australia holds a charcoal drawing made as a study for the work. Desolation was \\"a portrait of a woman cradling a ghostly child\\". The reviewer for the Sydney Morning Herald wrote of the painting: > Desolation is almost gruesome in the grim delineation of the figure > typifying all the widowed world in one lone woman. There she sits, lost in > an awful reverie, over the stricken battlefield. The work is an epitome of > wasteful ruin. Her triptych Pro Humanitate conveys the tragedy of her short marriage to Nicholas, but like Desolation, it was destroyed in a fire. The work comprised panels representing a happy couple in an outdoor vista; the moment of death of a soldier, arms outstretched in a crucifixion pose; and the grieving widow, watched by the ghost of the soldier. In visualising \\"the ruin caused by war\\", her works were more personal than those of other artists of the last years of World War I, such as Paul Nash and Eric Kennington, and her representation of widowhood was both unusual for its time, and confronting for the viewer. Return to Australia, 1918‚Äì1923 In March 1918, Rix Nicholas, along with her brother-in-law Athol Nicholas, left England and arrived in Melbourne on 10 May. There, with the encouragement of artist Henrietta Gulliver and the members of the city's Women's Art Club, Rix Nicholas began to reconstruct her career as a professional artist. It did not take long. In November, she was amongst the members of the Club whose works were displayed at the Athaeneum Hall, where a critic described her as the \\"dominating personality of the show\\". At the same time, in Melbourne's Guild Hall she held a large exhibition of her European and north African paintings, sketches and drawings, with over a hundred works on display. Several were sold, including In Picardy, purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Noting the artist's success in Paris and London, the reviewer for The Argus admired her \\"appreciation of character and talents for observation and representation\\", while The Age was struck by \\"the influence of modern French Impressionism in [her paintings'] fearless handling of sunlight and open air effects.\\" When the exhibition travelled to Sydney in 1919, reviews were likewise positive both from newspapers and from her peers such as Julian Ashton, Antonio Dattilo Rubbo and Grace Cossington Smith. The Sydney show also resulted in the purchase of several of her works by the Art Gallery of New South Wales. In 1919, Rix Nicholas moved to Sydney and settled in Mosman, where she made new friends and produced a range of landscapes and outdoor portraits, often continuing her post-impressionist style. The artist experienced further success in her exhibitions and with regular favourable reviews in the press, such as for her show in the Queen Victoria Markets in September 1920. Nevertheless, Pigot has argued that her place in the Australian art world at the time was complex, and her style was affected by vigorous debate around the emergence of modernism, which was being resisted by local critics. Her experience of this more conservative Australia, and the effects of the deaths of all those close to her, contributed to Rix Nicholas abandoning her more experimental art, and returning to more academic and figurative subjects. This ultimately had a detrimental effect on the long-term trajectory of her career. Pigot argues that her refusal to conform to the gendered expectations of the Australian artistic establishment led to her rejection. In 1922, a competition was launched by the trustees of the Melbourne Public Library for a mural to commemorate the Great War. Rix Nicholas learned of the competition and quickly prepared and submitted an entry. Three judges, all respected Melbourne academic artists, submitted a report to the trustees, who met to consider the entries received. The trustees voted six to five to grant the commission to Harold Septimus Power, despite the fact that he had not fulfilled the conditions of entry; they then withheld the judges' report from publication, decided not to exhibit any of the competition entries, and delayed awarding any prize. One newspaper reported that Rix Nicholas's entry had been one of the top three. Rix Nicholas was furious, as were some former soldiers who wrote letters to newspapers about the incident. Pigot suggests that gender was a factor: \\"While Rix Nicholas's claim to be a war artist was legitimate, the fact that she was a woman meant that she was denied an equal place within the discourse\\". The Australian War Memorial was building a collection of art commemorating the war around the time Rix Nicholas offered her triptych Pro Humanitate. But it was rejected; the acquisitions described it as ‚Äòof too intimate a character for inclusion in a public collection‚Äô. The Memorial eventually decided to purchase one of her works portraying a French woman (titled A Mother of France (1914)), but not the other work offered, which depicted an Australian soldier (A Man (1921). According to Pigot, this reflected the gendered approach taken by institutions, which considered that subjects suitable for portrayal by artists were dependent upon their sex. It may have further been influenced by the Memorial's strategy for collection development, which at that time emphasised acquisition of portraits of senior officers. Whatever the view of competition or acquisition committees, her works were \\"popular with the soldiers themselves, and in this way they actively shaped the image of the digger\\". Her paintings of war subjects were just one aspect of Rix Nicholas's developing commitment to nationalist ideals and the heroic representation of Australia. At the time of her 1919 exhibition, Rix Nicholas had commented that she wished \\"to show the people [of Europe] what is possessed in a land of beauty where the colour scheme is so different, and which sent so many gallant men to the struggle for liberty\\". In this respect she was following in the tradition of the Australian Impressionists and writers such as Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson, who extolled the virtues of the bush and pioneer life. Accompanied by her friend Dorothy Richmond, Rix Nicholas set out to paint in rural New South Wales, beginning in Delegate, a small town on the border of New South Wales and Victoria. Here she created numerous works, including In Australia, His Land, and The Shearers. Other works from this period include The Three Sisters, Blue Mountains (1921‚Äì22), which is in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia. While Australian patriotic imagery and discourse of the period was very male-dominated, Rix Nicholas's portraits were frequently of women, such as in The Monaro Pioneer, The Magpie's Song and Motherhood. Back in Sydney, Rix Nicholas held another solo exhibition in August 1923. Once again it was favourably reviewed, and there was again the description of her work in masculine terms: the reviewer at Sydney's Sunday Times described her as \\"the most virile, and, in many respects, the strongest woman painter Australia has yet produced\\". Rix Nicholas disliked being thought of as a \\"woman\\" artist, but she took such reviews as complimentary, given how dismissive were critics in general when considering paintings by women. Second trip to Europe, 1924‚Äì26 In Australia, painted by Rix Nicholas while staying at Delegate, New South Wales in 1922 or 1923. In 1924, Rix Nicholas, again travelling with Dorothy Richmond, set sail for France, intending to exhibit her works in Europe. She voyaged on the Ormonde, which was also carrying the Australian Olympic team. She befriended several of the team members and painted a portrait of one for an Olympic artists' competition. Arriving in Paris in June, eventually Rix Nicholas rented a studio in Montparnasse, which had previously belonged to French artist Rosa Bonheur. An exhibition at the \\"prestigious\\" Georges Petit Galerie in Paris in January 1925 was a great success. It led to important sales, including to the Mus√©e du Luxembourg, making her the only Australian woman to have more than one work in its collection and, according to one report, one of only three Australian artists represented at all at that time, the others being Rupert Bunny and Arthur Streeton. The exhibition led to a tour of her works to London and British regional galleries, the first time any Australian artist had archived such prominence; between 1926 and 1928, her works were shown in Hull, Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, Bootle, Blackpool, Northampton, Warrington, Folkestone, Leicester, Derby, Gateshead and Leek in Staffordshire. The work purchased by the Luxembourg in 1925 was In Australia, a portrait of Ned Wright, manager of the property at Delegate where she had stayed in the early 1920s. He is portrayed on horseback, a pipe clasped in his exposed and bright teeth, with a panoramic backdrop of an Australian pastoral landscape. His stance is casual, self-assured and heroic, consistent with the up-beat nationalism of Australia at the time. Les fleurs d√©daign√©es (1925) 1925 saw further exhibitions, including at the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, and the Royal Academy of Art, both in London. A solo exhibition that December at the Beaux Arts Gallery, London, displayed His Land, which was described as having \\"the rare quality of conveying the spirit of life in the Commonwealth as well as portraying that life pictorially ... the whole picture seems to convey the sunny heat-laden atmosphere of Australia\\". Like In Australia, this work suggests the elemental strength and vitality that Rix Nicholas advocated should pervade Australian painting. That year, Rix Nicholas created one of her most extraordinary and largest works. Standing almost high, and wide, Les fleurs d√©daign√©es ('The despised flowers') is an \\"unnerving\\" and \\"arresting\\" portrait of a young woman in fashionable eighteenth-century clothing. Painted not with the artist's typical technique, but in a mannerist style, the subject faces the viewer yet is glancing away, her pose tense, expression unreadable, with a bunch of discarded flowers on the ground next to the hem of her enormous formal dress. Although portraying a young lady, the person chosen to sit was \\"a Parisian professional model and a prostitute, apparently with a reputation for being moody and cantankerous\\". The pastiche created in this work is striking: a sixteenth-century artistic style, a composition comprising a seventeenth-century tapestry and an eighteenth-century dress, created by a twentieth-century artist. It certainly reflected the scope of Rix Nicholas's abilities and ambitions, and was painted with the specific intention of having it hung at the Paris Salon. When the work was displayed in Sydney in 1927, it grabbed The Sydney Morning Herald critic's attention: While she exhibited many of the Australian works completed before arriving in France, she was also creating many new works, including illustrations and portraits of traditional life and costume, produced during a summer in Brittany. In 1926, Rix Nicholas was again included in London's Royal Academy of Art exhibition, where one of her Brittany paintings, Le Bigouden, was hung. She appeared at the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition in Paris, in which she had eight works, a very large number for a single artist. The Soci√©t√© not only hung many of her paintings and drawings: she was elected an Associate to the organisation in that year. At the end of 1926, Rix Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond returned together to Australia. Energised by her success, Rix Nicholas purchased a car, filled its rear compartment with painting equipment, and the pair set out to paint the landscape, ranging from Canberra and the Monaro plains to the south, up into central Queensland. During a publicity-attracting occasion, she painted figures on the beach at Bondi, which was reported by various publications including Australian magazine, The Home. Wright and Knockalong, 1928‚Äì61 Rix Nicholas had met the farming family, the Wrights, in the early 1920s, including Ned, the subject of In Australia. After returning to the district, she married Edgar Wright on 2 June 1928 in Melbourne, and the couple settled on a property called Knockalong, near Delegate. She continued to exhibit under the name Rix Nicholas. Her friend Dorothy Richmond, with whom she had visited the region at the start of the decade, married Edgar Wright's cousin, Walter, and settled in the same region. Then, in 1930, Rix Nicholas and her husband had their only child, a son, whom they named Rix. The Summer House, painted circa 1933, is one of Rix Nicholas's best known works, but the artist herself was ambivalent about it and never showed it publicly. Characterising the modernist moment in Australian art - the period between the wars - is complex, as is understanding the position of individual artists within it. In France and North Africa in the 1910s, Rix Nicholas drew directly on impressionist ideas and techniques. In the 1920s, she had entertained Roy de Maistre, one of the first Australians to experiment with synchromism, and enthusiastically asked him to share more about his 'colour-music theory'. However, as she moved from urban to rural Australia, she did not continue to respond to radical modernist ideas. On one view, this represented a rejection of modernist themes and trends. Alternatively it can be read as Rix Nicholas's conscious decision to maintain her own creative direction. As Petersen put it, \\"Rix Nicholas did not identify as a woman artist or as a modernist but simply as an artist working outside any movement or style\\" who \\"remained disinterested in the debates in Sydney over modern art trends\\". There was in any case, as art historian Jeanette Hoorn wryly observed, \\"no market for post-impressionist painting in outback New South Wales in the 1920s\\". Rix Nicholas sought to build on her existing success and often focussed on portraits. Women were frequently portrayed, enjoying active rural life (as in The Fair Musterer) and working the land as well as in domestic or family scenes (as in On The Hilltop). Several images, such as On the Hilltop and Spring Afternoon, Knockalong portray women caring for a young son in a rural setting. Her most \\"stereotypically feminine\\" work was The Summer House, which shows two of Rix Nicholas's friends with some freshly cut flowers, in a setting that, unlike most of her works of the period, screened out the surrounding landscape. It was a picture about which Rix Nicholas was never convinced and which she never publicly displayed. Yet it has become one of her best known works, its easy acceptance consistent with the way reviewers in the 1930s pigeon-holed her work in terms of conventional gender roles. Rix Nicholas had a number of exhibitions with some further critical success. Nevertheless, she became out of step with both the public, who bought few works at her last solo exhibition in 1947, and with some critics, who either rejected her work or criticised its lack of novelty. One critic, Adrian Lawler, observed: > Mrs Rix Nicholas is very gifted and she has her own individuality as an > artist; but her personal outlook is not so much that of an artist with > startling things to say ... as of a healthy fellow-Australian who loves the > familiar beauty of our landscape and delights in representing it in all its > splendour and virility. Another, considering a 1936 exhibition at the David Jones Gallery in Sydney, found the quality of her work uneven, and while he considered some to be strong, others were criticised as \\"nothing more than pretty and sentimental\\". Rix Nicholas's works remained insistent in their idealism about rural Australia, but following World War II, the country ‚Äì and its art critics ‚Äì had moved on. In 1945, The Sydney Morning Herald critic, lambasting Rix Nicholas's works as \\"crude in colour and poster-ish in presentation\\", concluded: \\"There is insufficient spiritual material to fill the canvases of Hilda Rix Nicholas ... The bravura, the boldness of these pictures is hardly in keeping with the actual knowledge displayed. A certain humility, a close attention to the organisation of detail, and less white mixed into the colours would help tremendously.\\" The antipathy between Rix Nicholas and prevailing trends in Australian art was mutual. She was appalled by the works of Russell Drysdale and William Dobell, describing the figures in their paintings as \\"more like victims of the German prison camps\\" than representations of Australian people. It seemed that the critics did not share her opinion: Dobell and Drysdale had each just won the Wynne Prize in successive years, and both would soon represent their country at the Venice Biennale. A final trip to Europe took place in 1950. She set out to show her husband the sights of a Europe she knew well, and to find a teacher of sculpture for their son Rix. She was distressed by the standards of artistic practice she found, and instead discouraged Rix from any career in the arts at all. Following her last solo exhibition, a letter from Rix Nicholas to her son expressed despair in her artistic career and summarised the professional fate of her final years: > Not doing anything creative is nearly killing me. The trouble is that there > is no one near me who cares whether I ever do any more work or not ... I > feel the artist in me is dying and the dying is an agony ... only one's self > knows the craving and the best part in one is aching unsatisfied. By this time, her health was deteriorating, and her passion for art fading. Rix Nicholas did exhibit alongside her son in a group exhibition in Sydney, in 1954; she presented two oil paintings, while her son had the largest sculpture in the show, titled The Shearer. She died in Delegate on 3 August 1961. Legacy Gender was a recurring theme in Rix Nicholas's career, for better and for worse. Praise from a French art critic for her abilities was expressed by saying \\"[mademoiselle] Rix paints like a man!\\". An Australian critic was unsure what to say, admiring her composition but declaring her technique \\"strangely unfeminine\\", while another vitriolic review referred to the \\"pseudo-masculinity\\" of her works. Pigot considered that Rix Nicholas's career was ultimately penalised by her unwillingness to play by the male establishment's rules when she sought to stake out a woman's place in nationalist art in mid-twentieth century Australia. Sasha Grishin wrote that her \\"feminist tendencies and modernist touches were met with hostility\\". Art historian Catherine Speck had a different perspective on Rix Nicholas's post- World War I work, suggesting that it never subsequently attained the quality of her Paris output, because her first husband's death in the Great War drove her to create nationalist images of inconsistent quality. She suggested that Rix Nicholas's European works represented the modernist high point of the artist's career. Petersen agreed that \\"her tragic experiences during the war became integral to her artistic oeuvre and to her eventual concerns for national sentiment\\" but also thought that Rix Nicholas \\"continued to draw and paint with the same masterful sense of draughtsmanship, vigour and luminous paelette evident in her best work from Paris, Tangier and Sydney\\". In their reference work A Story of Australian Painting, Mary Eagle and John Jones considered Rix Nicholas, alongside Clarice Beckett, to be \\"the best woman artist to emerge from the artistic milieu of Melbourne in the decade of the First World War\\". Many of Rix Nicholas's works went into private collections for which records are limited. Many more were burned in a fire at the family property after her death in the 1960s. Despite having been welcomed to Australia as an \\"international art celebrity\\" in 1919, her fortunes declined in the latter part of her career. However, the twenty-first century saw a renewed appreciation of her output. Her oeuvre is represented in most major Australia public galleries, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and the Queensland Art Gallery, with many of the works (particularly those showing Moroccan subjects) purchased after the release of Hoorn's monograph. Other collections that have acquired her work include that of the Australian War Memorial. Internationally, Rix Nicholas is represented in the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume and Leicester Museum & Art Gallery, as well as by her works in the Luxembourg. There have been several posthumous solo exhibitions of Rix Nicholas's works: in 1971 at the Joseph Brown Gallery in Melbourne (established by artist Joseph Brown, donor of the Joseph Brown Collection), followed by a travelling exhibition in 1978, displayed at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Art Gallery of Ballarat and Macquarie Galleries. In the 1990s there were exhibitions at Ian Potter Museum of Art in Melbourne and the Caspian Gallery in Sydney, and in 2010 at Bendigo Art Gallery. In 2013 an exhibition of her work was held at Canberra's National Portrait Gallery. The National Gallery of Australia in 2014 chose The Three Sisters, Blue Mountains as the painting it would seek to acquire through its Members Acquisition Fund appeal. Rix Place in the Canberra suburb of Conder is named in her honour.

The film also featured bandleader Harry James. The film was a re-make of Thanks a Million, a 1935 musical produced and released by 20th Century Fox.  Plot  Band agent Wally Jones sends telegrams to members of a band he represents, which is presently \\"between engagements;\\" leader Earl Gordon is blowing bugle at a race track, singer Linda Farrell is selling tickets at a movie theater, harpist Michelle O'Toole is working as a hat-check girl and other band members are playing golf. They are all instructed to go to Centerville, where Wally has arranged for them to audition for the Titan Tire Company's president, Mr. Gillingwater, who wants new talent for his company's radio show. When the band arrives in Centerville, however, they are told by Wally that Gillingwater has hired Benny Goodman instead. Although they have hotel rooms for the night, they are low on cash and contrive to get a free meal at a \\"Magonnagle for Governor\\" political rally. The small crowd pays paying little attention to the candidate until Earl and the band start playing, so Magonnagle hires the band to accompany him on the rest of his campaign tour. Magonnagle is running with the slogan, \\"A Vote for Magonnagle Is a Vote for the Common Man,\\" but has little hope of beating the political machine that is backing corrupt, incumbent Governor Quilby. Composer Allen Clark shows up at one campaign stop, wanting to sell the band a song he has written. Earl buys the song for Linda, but Allen really wants to join the band as a singer. Wally finally hires him, partly to help carry his girl friend Michelle's harp. At one rally, Magonnagle is too drunk to speak and Allen delivers a brief pitch on his behalf. Mark Dwyer, a member of the corrupt State Campaign Committee decides to drop the ineffectual Magonnagle and instead run Allen as a candidate to avoid accusations of fraudulent election practices. Allen doesn't want to be involved, but Wally convinces him that it would be good exposure for his singing talents. Dwyer then introduces Allen to several political appointees, who are all cronies of his, and dupes him into signing continuing \\"appointments\\" for them. Allen does so, as he, too, fully expects Quilby to win. After Allen and Linda fall in love, Gillingwater asks the band to join his radio show, and Wally negotiates a thirty-nine-week contract at $10,000 per week. To Allen's surprise and distress, however, the polls indicate that he could win the election. Despite further inducements from the political machine, Allen wants to quit, but Dwyer threatens to break them all by revealing the phony \\"appointments.\\" To protect them, Allen dismisses the band. Magonnagle then returns and tells Linda about the political crooks backing Allen, and thinking that Allen has become one of them, she leaves with the band. In his closing campaign speech, prompted by Magonnagle, Allen denounces Dwyer and his political machine. Linda and the band hear Allen's speech on their bus's radio and return to help him escape from Dwyer. With Allen safely on board, the bus is pursued by police. When the police finally catch up with the bus, they inform Allen that Quilby has conceded the election to him. His friends convince Allen that he can be both governor and radio singer.  Production  If I'm Lucky offered Perry Como the most significant of his three roles for 20th Century Fox. This film's working titles were That's for Me and You're for Me. Edgar Buchanan was borrowed from Columbia Pictures for the production. According to the Twentieth Century-Fox Records of the Legal Department, the Batucada number was the last sequence to be shot and was photographed by Joseph La Shelle. The picture is very similar to the 1935 Twentieth Century-Fox production Thanks a Million, but neither credits nor studio information acknowledge that If I'm Lucky is a remake of the earlier film. That was also the last film of Carmen Miranda with Fox, ending her contract with the studio. In April 1947, Perry Como terminated his 20th Century Fox contract.

From 2008 to 2012 he was Air Commander Australia and from 2015 to 2016 he was CEO of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Early life and career Skidmore was born in Kowloon, Hong Kong on 15 March 1959, and joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as an Officer Cadet in 1977. He completed Number 113 Pilots Course and was posted to No. 1 Squadron, RAAF Base Amberley to fly the General Dynamics F-111. Following his tour on F-111s, Skidmore undertook the United States Naval Test Pilot School Fixed Wing course in 1985. At the completion of the course he was posted to the Aircraft Research and Development Unit, RAAF Base Edinburgh, where he flew F-111, Dassault Mirage III, Macchi MB-326H, AESL CT/4A and Douglas C-47 Dakota aircraft. In 1989, Skidmore returned to RAAF Base Amberley and completed tours at No. 1 Squadron as the Operational Flight Commander and No. 82 Wing as the Operations Officer. This was followed by a posting as the Flight Test Director on the F-111C Avionics Update Program in California, USA. Returning to Australia in 1996, he served as the Staff Officer Operational Systems at Headquarters Air Command, RAAF Base Glenbrook, before resigning from the RAAF in March 1998. Skidmore joined Aerospace Technical Services in 1998 as the Senior Test Pilot and Business Development Executive, positions he maintained following the company's acquisition in 1999 by Raytheon Systems Company. Skidmore rejoined the RAAF in 2000 and completed the Defence Staff Course at Weston Creek before being posted again to the Aircraft Research and Development Unit, this time as the Commanding Officer. From 2003 he was Director of Operational Requirements for the New Air Combat Capability project. Prior to assuming the position of Joint Force Air Component Commander in 2005 he attended the Defence and Strategic Studies Course at the Australian Defence College, Weston Creek. During 2005 he was deployed to the Middle East Area of Operations where he served as the Director Combined Air Operations Centre. For this service he was awarded a Commendation for Distinguished Service in the 2007 Australia Day Honours. Skidmore was promoted to the rank of air vice marshal and appointed as the Air Commander Australia on 27 June 2008. He was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2010. In 2013 Skidmore test flew the RAAF Museum replica Bristol Boxkite at Point Cook, Victoria for about 1000 metres and reached a speed of 42 mph.

He was only thirteen when he was appointed organist of Illogan Parish Church, Cornwall.(1876) Henry Charles Tonking In 1881 he went to study at the Royal Academy of Music, London. His professors were Dr.Charles Steggall (organ), Monsieur Sainton (violin), Mr.Ebenezer Prout (harmony & composition) and Sir George MacFarren (Pianoforte). After receiving six medals and a certificate of merit Mr. Tonking was appointed sub-professor of the organ to Steggall at the Royal Academy in 1885. Whilst there he had (Sir) Henry J.

Like Yakshas (nature-spirits), they are often described as attendants of Kubera, the god of wealth, and protect his hidden treasures. Guhyakas are believed to live in mountain caves; thus their name, \\"hidden ones\\". As lord of Guhyakas, Kubera is called \\"Guhyakadhipati\\".Hopkins pp. 144 Description Edward Washburn Hopkins suggests that Guhyakas may not be distinct beings, but a generic name for spirits of concealment. They are mentioned in the Manu Smriti and the Harivamsa, appendix of the epic Mahabharata, as distinct beings; however, the epic and the Meghaduta identify them with Yakshas. Guhyakas are described as the most trusted and close associates of Kubera, who resides with them on Mount Kailash. Kubera assigns them important tasks like delivering a magic eye-wash to the god and epic-hero Rama, to aid him in war. They also serve as messengers and are sent to witness battles. In other instances, they are described as residing on Hemakuta or on Mount Gandhamandana, in the palace of Kubera. They also live on earth and in hills.Hopkins pp. 147-8 They are described as half-bird or half-equine in nature. They have glowing forms in heaven, take demonic forms during war, and look like gnomes on earth. The Mahabharata, which treats them as a type of Yakshas, mentions that the airborne palaces of Kubera are held in the sky by Guhyakas; in other instances, the god himself is described as being carried by Guhyakas.Hopkins pp. 142-3. It is also described that Bhima, a hero in the epic, kills them when he attacks Kubera on Gandhamandana. The soldiers who die by sword neither bravely nor cowardly, as mentioned in the Mahabharata war, are said to go to the abode of Guhyakas after death. This is the second lowest realm that souls can enter, the lowest being Naraka (hell) for sinners. Guhyakas are also associated with Pitrs (\\"ancestors\\") and are sometimes equated to ghosts. The twin-physician gods Ashvins, annual plants, and inferior animals are described as Guhyakas.Hopkins p. 55 In the Bhagavata Purana, Kubera's son Nalakuvara and Manigriva are described as Guhyakas. Though often associated with Kubera, the Brihat-Samhita of Varahamihira as well as some Puranas describe Guhyakas as attendants of Revanta, the son of the Sun-god Surya. The Markandeya Purana mentions that Revanta was assigned the duty as the chief of Guhyakas by Surya.. In sculpture, Revanta is often depicted with the Guhyakas in hunting scenes.

Neville was an artist, and the son of Edgar Neville the Hollywood film director, playwright and novelist who became close friends with Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford (see book, Il Viaggio Americano, p. 107, by Ignacio Martinez de Pison). Raphael Neville's maternal family were Spanish aristocrats; his grandmother Maria Romree Y Palacios was a lady in waiting in the Spanish court and the family title was inherited through the male line from her. (http://www.grancanariaweb.com/cine/edgar/edgar2.htm ).

On the paternal side, his grandfather was the director of the Julius Neville motor company in Spain. Raphael was born on 26 August 1926 and sent to Paris and London to be educated. His father wanted him to study Architecture in Paris, but his bohemian son had other ideas, and became a chorus dancer in the Follies Bergeres dancing in Josephine Baker's shows. In 1959, Raphael took a trip to Sardinia, where he stumbled upon a small bay facing an Archipelago of little islands, (Maddalena archipelago) and he fell irrevocably in love with it. (see Book 'Sardinia' by Dana Facarci and Michael Pauls). He bought a small patch of land between Baia di Nelson (where Lord Nelson had once anchored his fleet) and Punta Sardegna, near the town of Palau, from a local landowner called Paolo Cudoni - and for the rest of his life, maintained he had first seen this place in a dream. \\"Sognare e Vivere\\" (to dream and to live) became the motto of his eponymous resort. Lord Nelson made a gift of silver candlesticks and a silver cross to the church of Santa Maddalena, on the island of La Maddalena across the water from Porto Rafael which are still on display at the \\"Diocesano\\" museum. In 1960, with the help of his friend the American actress Shirley Douglas, who later married Donald Sutherland, Neville began construction of a small port which he more or less designed himself. Many of the earliest buildings and the tiny chapel of Saint Rita were designed by Michele Busiri Vici, the renowned architect working for the Aga Khan, 30 mins along the coast at Porto Cervo. Shortly afterwards architects such as Alberto Ponis, who been an assistant to Denys Lasdun working on the National Theatre in London, arrived to add a gently modernist style to the resort, and Ponis has written several books on the architecture of Porto Cervo and Porto Rafael. Several celebrities built houses in Porto Raphael, choosing it above the more flashy Porto Cervo because there was no tourist hotel, and it was quiet, secluded and far from prying paparazzi. Along with the chapel, the centre of Porto Raphael includes a small delicatessen, one or two little bars, restaurants and boutiques, and at the beach beyond the Piazetta, a wooden pontoon for incoming tenders. There is also a yacht club at Marina Porto Rafael, two or three very small beaches and two tennis courts. One of the first to buy land and build a house, designed by Michele Busiri Vici, was Peter Ward, a brother of the Earl of Dudley. Then came a cousin of the Aga Khan, the Guinness heiress Maureen Dufferin (Maureen Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava) Obituary. In 1961 Raphael Neville was joined by Italian banker Dino Da Ponte and civil engineer, Roddy Wilson, and together they formed the Anglo- Italiana company, offering in total 140 hectares of land between the Fortress at Monte Altura and Punta Sardegna, for private sale and development. All the plots have long since been sold. The resort has always been developed with care and remains valued for its charm and privacy. Raphael Neville had many friends who flocked to his resort,. and he spent his summers in Porto Rafael until his death in 1996. His birthday is celebrated in the Piazetta every year on 11 August.

The musical was co-produced by the University of Arts Berlin and the Neuk√∂lln Opera. The issue of emancipation is told from the perspective of three young women in contemporary Berlin on the one hand and by three pastors daughters who live during the Victorian era in England on the other.  Synopsis  The musical parallels the restricted lives of the Bronte girls with those of three women of today.The Bronte Babes in Berlin. Gro√ües Lob von Kurt G√§nzl f√ºr Berliner Musical-Student*innen, Kurt G√§nzl, musical&Co;, 20. April 2014. The 18-year-old Berlin pupils Milly and Aydin are close to graduating from high school. However the two young women do not seem to have anything else in common: Milly tries to enjoy life to the fullest, and the visit of techno parties, the use of designer drugs and noncommittal sex are an expression of her personal freedom and her seemingly self-determined life. The possibilities that would give her the degree she is ignoring. Aydin, however, feared not being able to leave high school, and a marriage with her cousin from Bursa is arranged, but she does not even know him. While Aydin wants to make her own decisions about her life, she believes her father's attempts to help her are more likely to find a good man than if she were to seek offers on her own. The two very different settings of the two students repeatedly provoke violent arguments and criticism of each other's way of life, conversations her teacher Lotte Birkner does not tolerate in the classroom, because she is annoyed by feminist debates. She tries to focus the interest of the pupils on the lesson: the literary work of the three Bront√´ sisters. The novels and letters left by the Victorian-era English pastor's daughters Charlotte, Anne and Emily Bront√´ make them pioneers of emancipation. Cut off from the rest of the world, they write about the limited role of women prescribed by civil society and their visions of how it could be better. To be accepted by publishers, the Bront√´ sisters have to give themselves male pseudonyms. After their release the books are hotly debated by the British public, because of the progressive representation of women's fates, and also their own brother Branwell, who tried himself as a writer as well, is shocked when he recognizes the ambitious attempts of his sisters. Reading the Bront√´s' works, the pupils and their teacher realise that what the Bront√´ sisters have left in their novels and letters, although set in the Victorian era, is quite sudden surprisingly contemporary,Theater & B√ºhne: Schwestern im Geiste, TIP Online (Access: March 13, 2014) and they identify themselves increasingly with the sisters. The young women of today and here and the three dead writers become \\"sisters in spirit\\". Ultimately, the Bront√´s die young, but leave world literature that must be seen as a milestone of emancipation. Addicted to opium and alcohol, and full of despair about his own lack of genius, the brother dies first of tuberculosis. Shortly thereafter Emily follows and the second- youngest sister Anne a year later. After the death of all of her siblings Charlotte Bront√´ gives up the utopia of freedom and self-determination and marries the staid curate Arthur Nicholls, who urges her to stop writing. Even in today's Berlin, in terms of emancipation the story ends rather with a set of knowledge gains than with a \\"happy ending\\". World premiere Schwestern im Geiste was specifically written for graduates of the Universit√§t der K√ºnste (University of Arts) by the author and director Peter Lund who has worked here as a professor. The world premiere was the result of a longstanding cooperation between the Universit√§t der K√ºnste and Neuk√∂llner Oper Berlin instead, and it took place there on March 13, 2014 in the Neuk√∂lln Opera, Berlin.

It was established in 1957 by the Society for Medieval Archaeology and is published on their behalf by Taylor & Francis. The editor-in-chief is Aleks McClain (University of York).  History  In the mid-20th century, archaeology in Britain was dominated by interests in prehistory and the classical period. The Society for Medieval Archaeology was founded in the 1950s to share information about medieval archaeology, and to publish a journal similar to the Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society. The cost of producing the journal meant that external grants were needed early on, supplementing the society's membership fees. As a result, excavation reports were common especially in early volumes of the journal. Medieval Archaeology inspired the creation of other similarly themed academic journals, Arch√©ologie medi√©vale (French), Zeitschrift f√ºr Arch√§ologie des Mittelalters (German), and Archeologia Medievale (Italian). To mark the Society for Medieval Archaeology's 50th anniversary in 2006, the first 50 volumes of Medieval Archaeology were made available online via the Archaeology Data Service and are free to access. In 2007, Medieval Archaeology began including abstracts translated into French, German, and Italian.

Solar Hill was sold off for development in 1871, but significant development did not begin until 1890. Between 1890 and the 1920s the area was built up with high quality Colonial Revival and American Craftsman style homes, and had a reputation as the fashionable residential area for Bristol's elite.

Since independence in 1991, Turkmenistan has had the most limited film production industry of any Central Asian state. History =Early years= The earliest films in Turkmenistan were newsreels, documenting topical events such as elections, the erection of Lenin monuments, and anniversary celebrations for the 1917 October Revolution. The first documentary to be produced in Turkmenistan itself was Provozglashenie Turkmenskoi SSR (Proclamation of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic), which was the work of Sergei Lebedev and Boris Bashem, two Russian cameramen from the Sevzapkino film studio in Leningrad, in 1925. A film studio, the Ashgabat Kinofabrica, was founded in Turkmenistan's capital city the following year, with a film output consisting of documentaries, propaganda films and newsreels. Film exhibitions were often accompanied by educational lectures on the theme of the film. The first feature-length film to be produced at the new Turkmenistan film studio was Alexander Vladychuk's documentary Beloe Zeloto (White Gold) in 1929, which focussed on collectivization in the cotton industry. The same topic was covered by the first feature film, Zemlya Zhazhdet (The Earth is Thirsty), directed by Yuli Raizman and released in 1930. This film was made for Vostokkino and was originally silent, but had a soundtrack added a few months later. The first feature-length film to be produced with sound was Alexander Ledashchev's 1935 film I'll Be Back, which focused on the story of a young labourer, Kurban. According to Swetlana Slapke, the film \\"made an indelible impression on the audience, mainly because it was the first feature film in their lives and about their lives\\". Its release was accompanied by a kind of festival, with music from a military brass band. Other directors active at the studio at the time included Vladimir Lavrov, Djavanshir Mamedov, Nikolai Mikhailovich Kopysov, Djuma Nepesov and Shadurdy Annaev. =1940s= In 1939, the Ashgabat Kinofabrica was reorganised as the Turkmenfilm Studio. The first film shot at the new studio was Dursun (1940), which was directed by Yevgeni Ivanov-Barkov. Ten years earlier, Ivanov-Barkov had made a successful film Judas, but had made little since, until the film studio invited him to make Dursun. The film was based on a careful study of Turkmen culture and traditions, and all of the actors in the film were Turkmen, except the leading actress Nina Alisova. In 1941, the Kiev Film Studio was evacuated to Ashgabat because of the Second World War. Ukrainian directors from the film studio partnered with personnel from the Turkmenfilm Studio to make newsreels and other films. The Ukrainians were generally more experienced, and so the war became a period of training for young Turkmen filmmakers. Swetlana Slapke argues that, \\"During this period, the overall professional - and especially technical - competence of Turkmen film-makers noticeably improved\\". Post-war development of Turkmen cinema was halted in 1948 when the Turkmenfilm studio building was destroyed in a major earthquake, resulting in the temporary cessation of filmmaking activities. Studios elsewhere in Central Asia produced newsreels and documentaries, but no feature films. =1950s, 1960s and 1970s= The Turkmenfilm studio was rebuilt in the 1950s, and began producing feature films again. The first films were by Rafail Perelshtein, The Shepherd's Son (1954) and The Cunning of Old Ashir (1955). In 1957, the first colour film produced by Turkmenfilm was released: Extraordinary Mission, which was directed by Ivanov-Barkov and Alty Karliev. The 1960s and 1970s were significant decades for Turkmen filmmaking. Where previously, most of the films produced in the Turkmen studio had involvement from Russian and Ukrainian directors, a new generation of Turkmen filmmakers emerged, and were responsible for most of the productions. These filmmakers were the first Turkmen graduates of the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow, and were young but well-trained. Most notable among them was Khodzhakuli Narliev. Other new directors of the period included Yazgeldy Seidov, Kurban Yazhanov, Murad Kurbanklychev and Mukhamed Soiunkhanov.

It was preceded by the 1895 election and followed by the 1901 election. Glamorgan was by far the largest county in Wales in terms of population. Glamorgan County Council had been established by the 1888 Local Government Act, and the first elections held in early 1889. The county of Glamorgan was at this time becoming heavily industrialised, although some areas such as the Vale of Glamorgan remained essentially rural. The rise of nonconformist liberalism, especially since the 1860s, throughout Wales, had challenged the prevailing influence of the landed gentry. However, even in 1889, the traditional forces remained influential and no working men were elected to the Council. This changed in 1892 with the unopposed return of David Morgan in Aberdare and the success of Isaac Evans in Resolven. Overview of the result As in most parts of Wales, the Liberal Party was once again triumphant and won a majority of the seats. In 1895 there were more unopposed results than in previous elections and the Conservatives made some headway, reflecting the position in the United Kingdom as a whole where the party took power that year. Results are drawn from a number of sources. The include an account of unopposed returns in the Evening Express, and results from the same newspaper as well as the Cambrian and Pontypridd Chronicle. Boundary changes There were no boundary changes at this election. Retiring aldermen All eleven retiring aldermen were Liberals. Gwilym Jones, W.H. Mathias, J.C. Meggitt, Herbert Evans and the Rev Aaron Davies all sought re-election. Jones and Mathias were returned unopposed while Meggitt's only opponent withdrew before polling day. Herbert Evans was opposed by the sitting Liberal councillor whom he eventually narrowly defeated (see Cwmavon, below). Aaron Davies was defeated at Pontlottyn. At Aberdare, David Price Davies was also nominated but withdrew rather than face a contest with the sitting councillor. Contested elections Results =Aberaman= =Aberavon= =Aberdare Town= Prior to the election it became apparent that Evans, the sitting councillor and the retiring alderman, David Price Davies, both coveted the seats.

Biography Rexhep Voka was born in 1847 in the village of ≈ûipkovica, Kalkandelen. In 1868, Voka undertook religious studies in Istanbul where he worked as a professor after completing his education. Voka returned to Kalkandelen in 1895 where he became involved in the Albanian National Renaissance. In 1903, Voka was appointed Mufti of the Manastir Vilayet and founded the first Albanian theological college in √úsk√ºb.Rexhep Voka In Monastir, before the Young Turk revolution, Voka started learning Albanian in Latin characters from Albanian Protestant missionaries. In 1905, Voka attended the Pan-Albanian Congress organized in Bucharest. Headed by Albert Ghica, attended by Ismail Qemali and deliberated with Bucharest's Albanian community, the congress discussed the Albanian issue. Rexhep Voka was a member of Bashkimi (Unity) at the time of the Young Turk revolution. He printed an Albanian alphabet in Arabic script comprising forty-four letters, called Elifbaja shqip. Tiranli Fazli then used this script to publish a thirty-two page grammar. Only one Albanian newspaper at the time ever appeared in Arabic script, and it lasted a brief period. Regardless of what script appeared, such material raised Albanian national consciousness. Legacy Rexhep Voka was highly regarded among Albanians for his involvement with the Albanian National Awakening. He encouraged education and schooling for the Albanians and has a statue dedicated to him in his birthplace of Shipkovica.

Each consists of the main chain atoms only of three consecutive amino acid residues. The first and third main chain CO groups bind the cations, often calcium, magnesium, potassium or sodium, with no side chain involvement. Many catgrips bind a water molecule instead of a cation; it is hydrogen-bonded to the first and third main chain CO groups. Catgrips are found as calcium- binding features in annexins, matrix metalloproteinases (e.g.serralysins), subtilisins and phospholipase A2. They are also observed in synthetic peptides and in cyclic hexapeptides made from alternating D,L amino acids. Residues 98-100 of annexin V (2ran, main chain atoms only) bound to a calcium ion The conformation of a catgrip is such that the CO groups of the first and third amino acid residues are liable to be electrostatically attracted or hydrogen bonded to a positively charged, or partially positively charged, atom or group. Catgrips are defined by the phi, psi main chain dihedral angles of the second and third amino acids in the nest. If two catgrips overlap such that two successive residues are both residue i of catgrips, a compound catgrip is formed. If three overlap such that three successive residues are residue i of catgrips, a longer catgrip is formed and so on. Such overlapping motifs may bind one, two or three metal ions. An example is given by residues 586-590 of Cas9 endonuclease (pdb code 4oge) where the mainchain CO groups from residues i, i+2 and i+4 bind a magnesium ion.

She first came to prominence in 1974 when, with writer Kathleen Thompson, she wrote Against Rape (Farrar, Straus, 1974), the book that broke the silence on rape internationally.Bevacqua, Maria. Rape on the Public Agenda. Northeastern University press, 2000, p. 47 She later founded Chimera, Inc., which for more than twenty years taught self-defense classes for women based on Medea's early theories of conflict. In the early 2000s, she developed Medea's Conflict Continuum, which she built upon in two books, \\"Conflict Unraveled\\" (Pivot Point Press, 2005) and \\"Going Home Without Going Crazy\\" (New Harbinger, 2006) and a number of courses, both online and on video, for veterans, lawyers, judges, psychiatric staff and others. Her video \\"Working with Emotional Clients: The Virtual Tranquilizer for Lawyers\\" (American Bar Association, 2010) has been a best-selling continuing education program for the ABA. More recently, she developed this work on the continuum even further in \\"Safe Within These Walls: De-escalating School Situations Before They Become Crises\\" (Capstone, 2013).  Early life and activism  Medea was the daughter of a Lithuanian American machinist, Edward Thomas, and his wife, Emily, who was a homemaker and community activist. While she was growing up in Chicago's Marquette Park, the neighborhood was a racial battleground, and Medea learned her first techniques for dealing with conflict on the street. She was profoundly affected by her mother's activism. Emily Thomas helped found the Southwest Committee on Peaceful Equality, aimed at fighting prejudice by encouraging dialogue between races, and was one of the founders of Southwest Women Working Together, organized to address the needs of women of all races and ethnicities on the Southwest Side.Kates, Joan Giangrasse. \\"Activist fought racism in Chicago.\\" Chicago Tribune, May 24, 2002 Medea followed in her mother's footsteps. In 1966. Dr. Martin Luther King led two open housing marches in Marquette Park, which were met by white mobs who attacked the marchers and burned cars. Dr. King was hit in the head with a rock and later stated, \\"I have never in my life seen such hate. Not in Mississippi or Alabama. This is a terrible thing.\\"Branch, Taylor. At Canaan's Edge: America in the King Years, 1965-68. Simon & Schuster, New York. 2006, 511. During King's Chicago campaign, Medea went to King's west side headquarters, where she first met civil rights leaders. During this time, the American Nazi Party (formally, the National Socialist Party of America), at that time headed by Frank Collin, established its headquarters on 71st St., two blocks from Medea's home. She and a small group of friends took it upon themselves to \\"vandalize\\" the party's racist billboards.Documenting Women's Activism and Leadership in Chicago, 1945-2000, Chicago Women's History Council. Oral history transcript, 2013. In April 1972, Medea organized, at the Chicago Loop Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), the first conference in the Midwest on the subject of rape. Kottke, Lee Rape: Common American Experience. Chicago Daily News, April 19, 1972. Out of that conference came the organization Chicago Women Against Rape, of which Medea was one of the founders, and the book Against Rape, which Medea wrote with Kathleen Thompson.  Against rape  Against Rape was published in 1974, going through seven printings before its official publication date. It was serialized in hundreds of newspapers around the country and remained in print for eighteen years. It was a time when women across the country were coming to terms with the issue. Organizations similar to Chicago Women Against Rape were formed in other large cities and small towns. Women created and staffed rape crisis hotlines and worked to reform treatment of women in hospitals, by police and by courts. Other important books on the subject were published, including, Rape: A First Sourcebook for Women by the New York Radical Feminists (New American Library, 1974). In 1975, Susan Brownmiller's Against Our Will added a profound historical element to the discussion. In Against Rape, Medea's groundbreaking self-defense methods were first developed and published. Not long after its publication, Medea founded Chimera: Self-Defense for Women.  Chimera, Inc.  This innovative form of self-defense combined street fighting, some martial arts techniques, and a great deal of non-physical strategy that pre-figured Medea's conflict resolution theories. That strategy was based on both her street fighting experiences and her martial arts training. Medea's focus on analyzing a conflict situation has remained at the forefront of her work throughout her career. As she later said in an interview in the Chicago Reader, \\"The basic mentality behind Chimera is you think and you keep thinking and you do not let someone psych you out. You need physical skills, but your brain is the most important thing you have.\\"Chimera, Inc., Case Statement (1983) in Women and Leadership Archives, Chicago Women's History Council. Against Rape was the primary text for the self-defense courses of Chimera, Inc., for more than a decade. The Chimera program expanded to six states and trained upwards of 50,000 students.Joravski, Ben. \\"Fighting Chances; Andra Medea wrote the book on how to deal with bullies.\\" Chicago Reader, April 16, 2004, 5.  Medea's conflict continuum  Medea's Conflict Continuum has been the basis of all her conflict management work. She developed it while teaching courses using this theoretical model as a lecturer at Northwestern University and DePaul University and an instructor at the University of Chicago. According to Medea, forms of human conflict can be analyzed with the Continuum and then approached in a way that is appropriate to the level on which the conflict is taking place, thereby increasing the probability that it can be resolved. The analysis applies to conflicts that vary as greatly as parent- teacher conferences and international border disputes. Medea delineates four levels of conflict, all characterized by specific behaviors and likely outcomes. The first three are treated in her books. They also inform her work with a variety of government agencies and professional organizations. For example, in 2009, she was called to testify on learned helplessness and barriers to ethical behavior before the Illinois Reform Commission in the wake of the Rod Blagoyevich scandal.Reform Illinois Now.org (April 24 2009) Videos Wayback Machine In 2010, she spoke at the First Annual Illinois Administrative Law Conference on the physiology of stress in the courtroom. Although much of her work has been with attorneys and judges, she has also used her model in work with returning veterans, psychiatric staff and others. In 1987, she established Medea and Associates, of which she is president.  Safe Within These Walls  As conflict in schools increased in recent years, Medea turned her attention to practical techniques to de-escalate aggression and prevent crises. The book has been well received by teachers, administrators, and school counselors. Education World describes the book this way: \\"Bottom Line: If you're looking to deal with sensitive classroom situations, such as ones involving students with behavioral and developmental issues, and ones that risk becoming heated and/or violent, this book is the perfect resource.\\"Cunningham, Jason. Review of Safe Within These Walls. Education World, February 10, 2014 In addition to Safe Within These Walls, Medea does professional development presentations and workshops about crisis prevention in the schools.

Similar motifs occur with aspartate or asparagine as residue i, called asx turn. Four types of asx turn and ST turn can be distinguished: types I, I‚Äô, II and II‚Äô. These categories correspond (via sidechain-mainchain mimicry of residue i) to those of the more abundant hydrogen-bonded beta turns, which have four residues and a hydrogen bond between the CO of residue i and the NH of residue i + 3\\\\. Regarding their occurrence in proteins, they differ in that type I is the commonest of the four beta turns while type II‚Äô is the commonest of the ST and asx turns. Asx and ST turns both occur frequently at the N-termini of Œ±-helices, as part of asx motifs or ST motifs, with the asx, serine or threonine as the N cap residue. They are thus often regarded as helix capping features. Evidence for a functionally relevant ST turn is provided in the CDR3 region of the T-cell receptor (B chain, V domain) A proportion of ST turns are accompanied by a mainchain-mainchain hydrogen bond that qualifies them as ST motifs.

Construction began in 1853 and the site is officially called Kennington Holder Station by its owners, Southern Gas Network. It is a grade II listed building with the listed part of them known as Gasholder No. 1.https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1427396 History The Phoenix Gas Light & Coke Company bought the site north of the Oval in 1845 from the Southwark & Vauxhall Waterworks Company, who had laid out the site in 1807 as a waterworks with an engine house and two circular brick-lined reservoirs. The Phoenix Gas Company adapted the circular reservoirs for gasholder tanks and erected five gasometers between 1847 and 1874. The first iron gasholder was installed on the site in 1847 to service a gasworks next to Vauxhall Bridge. The Phoenix Gas Light and Coke Company replaced it in 1877‚Äì79 to designs by Sir Corbet Woodall, with two lifts holding 3 million cubic ft, making it the largest gasholder in the world. It was enlarged again by Frank Livesey in 1891‚Äì92 for the South Metropolitan Gas Company, by modifying the guides to increase their height by 50%, and adding two more lifts, including a \\"flying lift\\" rising above the guides, doubling its capacity to 6 million cubic feet. It is an early use of wrought iron in a frame.Historic England This structure, Gasholder 1, is Grade II listed by virtue of: a) its being the world's largest gasholder at the time, b) its famous designers Frank and George Livesey and c) its being an internationally renowned backdrop to matches at the adjacent Oval Cricket Ground. The cylindrical wrought iron guide frame is about high, with 24 t-section lattice standards, rising in three tiers and connected by three rows of horizontal lattice girders, with a rising \\"bell\\" of four tiers, including the top \\"flying lift\\" rising above the standards. It would have topped when full. A second gasholder, No.2, was constructed in 1854‚Äì5 and converted to a spiral-guided holder in 1950, which does not require a frame. No.3 was constructed in 1869 but demolished c.1975. The conjoined pair of Gasholders No. 4 & 5, erected in 1874 and 1876, was designed by Sir Corbet Woodall and is locally listed. Each of these gasholders has an elegant neo-classical style frame and Tuscan columns. The gasometers were decommissioned in 2014 and the site is due for redevelopment. There are concerns that only the nationally listed No.1 gasometer will be preserved. Cricket ground The gasholders are adjacent to, and overlook, The Oval at the Vauxhall End of the ground. They have been long considered part of the traditional background of The Oval with the largest gas holder only ten years younger than the cricket ground, which was established in 1846. During England cricket team matches, huge advertising banners hang from the gas holders. They are regularly referred to in Test Match Special broadcasts. In 2008 Surrey County Cricket Club, tenants of The Oval, announced plans to redevelop the ground along the side nearest the gas holders. However, their redevelopment plans were objected to by the Health and Safety Executive because of the proximity to the gas holders and amid fears that they might explode despite not cracking or leaking since construction. This view was supported by London Fire Brigade, who listed the gas holders as a hazardous site. As a result, Surrey considered buying the gas holders and decommissioning them. The objection of the Health and Safety Executive was rejected by the Secretary of State and planning inspector. = Future = In 1999, plans were announced to dismantle all of the United Kingdom's gasholders due to being made largely redundant due to improvements in gas storage. This was intended to include the Oval Gas Holders. Regeneration of these contaminated brownfield sites can help deliver London with much needed homes. Berkeley Homes and Lambeth Council are working together cooperatively to prepare a Masterplan for an area surrounding the Oval Gas Holders. This is known as the Oval and Kennington Development Area (OAKDA). A preliminary consultation with the local community occurred in January and February 2015 to discover local aspirations. Draft Masterplan proposals will be released to a second consultation towards the end of the year. In March 2012 Lambeth Council locally listed the three gas holders of 1874, 1876 and 1892 (No.4, No.5 and No.1). In 2015, Lawrence D'Silva, a 26 year old local resident, presented a case to Historic England to make the gasholders listed buildings. Subsequently, Historic England assessed them all for national listing and in March 2016 decided to grant Grade II listed status to just one of the Oval Gasholders ‚Äì No.1 (the largest of the them) dating from 1892. The national listing designation supersedes the local listing status of this gasometer so Gasholder No. 1 was subsequently removed from the Local list by Lambeth ‚Äì Nos. 4 & 5 remain locally listed. There is a strong presumption in the planning decision-making process against the demolition of a nationally listed heritage asset.

He was the son and successor of Arshusha II. Varsken was a highly regarded man among the Iranians, and played a leading role in the Sasanians effort to Zoroastrianize the Caucasus, which even made him murder his own wife Shushanik and attack Iberia, which resulted in his death at the hands of the troops of the Chosroid ruler Vakhtang I in 482.  Origins  Varsken belonged to the Mihranid family of Gardman. The family claimed Sasanian Persian descent, but were in reality a branch of the Parthian Mihranid family of Ray... Although the family of Varsken originally practiced Zoroastrianism, it converted to Christianity during the family's service in the Caucasus.  Biography  Map of Greater Armenia, which includes Gugark Varsken's mother was Anushvram Artsruni, an Armenian noblewomen from the Artsruni family, who was the sister- in-law of the Armenian aristocrat Hmayeak Mamikonian, himself brother of the Armenian rebel and martyr Vardan Mamikonian. Varsken's father, Arshusha II, was a hostage of the Sasanian court at Ctesiphon, and could not participate in the Christian Armenian rebellion in 451, led by Vardan Mamikonian. After the defeat of the Armenian rebels at Avarayr, Hmayeak Mamikonian was killed at Tao. Hmayeak's sons, Vahan Mamikonian, Vasak, Vard and Artaxias, were then taken hostage and sent to Ctesiphon, where they met Arshusha II... Arshusha was later able to buy his freedom back. He then freed the sons of Hmayeak, and took them back to Armenia with their mother. Later, Arshusha organized the wedding of his son Varsken with Shushanik, daughter of Vardan Mamikonian... Upon the death of his Arsusha, Varsken went to Ctesiphon with the Sasanian shah Peroz I, and converted to the family's former religion, Zoroastrianism. He shortly married a daughter of Peroz and was given the governorship of Caucasian Albania. He later went back to Armenia, where he tried to force his first wife, Shushanik, to convert to Zoroastrianism, but the latter refused. Varsken then threatened her to send her on a donkey to Ctesiphon, where she would get executed. Shushanik, however, once again refused, and eventually died from the violence inflicted by her husband.. Varsken later sought to conquer Iberia, and was given support by Peroz. In 482, Varsken invaded Iberia, but he was defeated and killed by its ruler Vakhtang I..

Sometimes, instead, it involves a pet or other domestic animal, as for example in Francis Coventry's The History of Pompey the Little (1751). This and other such works blended satire with the interest for contemporary readers of a roman √† clef.

Quite generally, it-narrative in the 19th century is typified by an animal narrator. It has been remarked that the slave narrative genre of the 18th century avoided being confused with the it-narrative, being thought of as a type of biography.

It is part of the so-called Saar position and lies within the borough of the German town of Merzig.  Siegfried Line  The defensive system of the Siegfried Line was built between 1936 and 1940 on the western border of the German Empire and had a length of around 630 kilometres. It consisted of a huge number of bunkers and tank obstacles of many different types. A total of 22,000 bunkers and structures was planned, and around 14,800 were actually built, including 32 armoured works of construction standard (or thickness) \\"B\\", whence the German term B-Werk.  B-Werke  The B-Werke were the largest and best-equipped bunker systems in the Siegfried Line. Their name is derived from the construction thickness standards, whereby \\"B\\" referred to wall and ceiling thicknesses of 1.5 metres. Officially the term Panzerwerk (\\"armoured structure\\") or a codename (such as the name of an animal, field or military figure) was used in order not to give away the construction thickness to the enemy.  The Besseringen B-Werk  The B-Werk in Besseringen dates to the years 1938 and 1939. Its construction cost then about 1,300,000 Reichsmarks. It was made from about 2,800 cubic metres of concrete and 200 tonnes of steel. The structure is three storeys high and has over 44 rooms with a floor area of 24.60 metres by 17.80 metres. It was intended for a crew of 85 to 90 soldiers who, if necessary, could live and fight autonomously in the B-Werk for up to 30 days. The bunker had its own water and electricity supply, air filter systems, engine rooms and accommodation, and was equipped with two turrets, each with six weapon ports, an observation cupola and flanking embrasures (Schartenplatten). Its weaponry consisted of machine guns for the two six-port turrets and the flanking ports, as well as an M 19 grenade launcher and a fixed FN flamethrower. In addition, there were the normal rifles carried by the infantry, the Mauser Model 98. The B-Werk was designated as Bunker No. 38401 and, later, as WH No. 118.  Weaponry and armour plating  One of the two 20P7 six-port turrets The main weapons were the two MG 34 machine guns in each six-port turret. These machine guns were fixed to gun mounts in the turrets and could be moved from port to port on rails. They could also be aimed using circular scales on the inside walls of the turret. The machine guns could not be placed in two adjacent ports; there always had to be at least one port between the two gun positions. The ports were closed when not in use by universal ball joint locks (Kugelkalottverschl√ºssen). The gun mounts had a matching ball head that sealed the ports when the machine gun was in its firing position. The six-port turrets were of Type 20P7, had an average wall thickness of 255 millimetres, an inside diameter of 2.25 metres and a weight of 51 tonnes. Their overall height was 2.64 metres, of which only 1.34 metres projected above the roof of the bunker. Due to their effective range of 1,650 metres, the machine guns in the turrets could be seen as the \\"long distance weapons\\" of the bunker; in particular, they could cover the opposite bank of the River Saar and the hillside that climbed away from it. The M 19 grenade launcher was intended for close-quarter defence. It had a range of between 20 and 600 metres and could in theory fire up to 120 50mm grenades per minute. The grenade launcher was built into an armoured Type 424P01 turret, which only projected 0.50 metres above the top of the bunker. The turret had a weight of 26 tonnes, an inside diameter of 1.70 metres, an overall height of 2.63 metres and an average wall thickness of 250 millimetres. The fortress flamethrower was known as a Festungs-Nahkampf-Ger√§t, a fortress close quarter combat device. It was intended for the defence of the top of the bunker and the immediate surrounding area. Its maximum range was 40 metres and it could last up to 90 seconds, using 120 litres of oil. The flamethrower worked at a pressure of 20 atmospheres which was created in a special pressure cylinder. The pressure vessel was filled from a container that held 2,500 litres of oil. The device took two minutes to prepare for firing (filling the pressure vessel and building up the pressure). The ignition of the oil was achieved using acetylene gas. Flank position with armour plating and stepped embrasure For observation and fire control the commander had a Type 90P9 observation cupola. Through 5 slits, that could be closed by slides, the commander could observe the surrounding area and direct fire using two armoured periscopes. The cupola had a weight of 6 tonnes, an average wall thickness of 120 millimetres, an overall height of 1.6 metres of which only 0.65 metres protruded above the bunker. There was another machine gun in a flank fire position of the bunker that covered the entrance. It is not entirely clear which machine gun was used here. The weapon was fixed to a box stand (Untersetzkasten) with the corresponding gun mount. The flank fire position had a 7P7 armoured embrasure plate with a thickness of 10 centimetres and a weight of 7.5 tonnes, in front of which there was a stepped embrasure made of concrete. By means of a slide, the embrasure and observation slit could be closed. In addition, for the viewing slit there was a sliding plate of armoured glass which could be used to observe the situation when under fire.  Technical facilities  = Power = The engine room took up two floors, the upper floor could only be entered through the engine room from below. The bottom of the upper floor consisted of steel beams and plates. For power generation, the bunker had two diesel generators in the engine room. These were water-cooled, four-cylinder, four- stroke engines, generating 38 hp each. The alternators each produced 28 kW of three-phase, alternating current at 380 volts. This powered the electric motors in the bunker, the electric heaters in the accommodation and the boilers and hobs in the kitchen. The main lighting was supplied at 220 volts. Sensitive areas were operated by accumulator batteries to ensure continuity of power available in case the generators failed. This delivered a 24 volt power supply to light the battle positions and the optics as well powering the emergency lighting. The radio room of the bunker had its own separate 24-volt batteries. Today, the generators have been removed. = Air filter system and ventilation = An important aspect of the bunkers of the Siegfried Line was their ability to operate under gas attack. The bunkers could be hermetically sealed and supplied with purified air from outside. Because of their importance, the B-Werke had the most elaborate filter systems designed and built into the facilities. A constant overpressure prevented the penetration of gases in the event of minor leaks and allowed the removal of stale air and exhaust gases from the battle positions. One or more spaces were combined to form gas-tight cells. Pressure relief valves in the rooms or cells regulated the pressure. The air sucked in from outside was passed through a pre-filter, which cleared the air of dust and water vapour. Then it flowed through four, parallel, room filters, which filtered dangerous gasses out using active carbon inserts. If required, the air for heating the bunker could be warmed using a heat exchanger before being blown into the bunker. The capacity of the central fan was 40 m¬≥ / minute. To ensure the ventilation of the plant even in the event of the central fan failing, individual rooms or cells had hand- operated HES ventilators (army unit protection ventilators) with 1.2 m¬≥ or 2.4 m¬≥ capacity per minute. The central fan and its filters was located above the engine room but is no longer in place. = Communication facilities = The bunker had a sophisticated array of communication facilities. Three underground cables of the fortress telephone network were terminated in a separate radio room, where there was a switchboard. Its inputs included slots into which field cable could also be connected either to provide additional cable connections or to bridge damaged underground cable. Telephones were installed in the most important room or at least connections for portable telephones were available. The turrets were connected independently of the central exchange in the radio to the associated battle preparation rooms with separate telephone lines. Voicepipes were used to link the inner entrance defence rooms and the flank fire position. = Water supply = The bunker had its own well. In the well chamber was a pump that pumped the water into a tank. From there water was pumped into a pressure vessel in order to provide the necessary water pressure to the taps. There were take-off points in the kitchen, the sick bay, the command post, the hallways and the washroom. The bunker only had wash basins, there were no showers, in the toilets and in the engine room. In addition to the need for drinking water, water was needed to cool the diesel generator sets and there was also an automatic sprinkler system in the ammunition store. Waste water was collected in a pit from where it was pumped to the surface by an electric pumping system activated by a float.  Manning during the Second World War  The Besseringen B-Werk was first used in the period after its completion until summer 1940, when its occupation no longer seemed necessary following the successful German invasion of France. In autumn 1944 it was manned again. After the Allies had surrounded Merzig in spring 1945, during Operation Undertone, its crew left the bunker at Besseringen.  Post-war period  After the end of the war almost all the fittings of the B-Werk were removed. The site was used as a rubbish tip and was walled up and covered with earth in 1980. In 1997 work began on uncovering and restoring it. From 1997 to 2002 the site was managed by the Merzig Reservist Association (Reservistenkameradschaft Merzig) and, from 2002, the Merzig Local History Society (Verein f√ºr Heimatkunde Merzig). = Museum = In autumn 2005 the B-Werk was opened to the public, although, as at September 2011, not all areas of the site may be visited and opening times are restricted to Sundays and public holidays between April and September from 2 to 6 pm. In the basement there is a permanent exhibition of the fighting at the Orscholz Switch (also known as the Siegfried Switch) as well as the consequence for the civilian population and resistance movements. To date (Sep 2011), four rooms have been restored almost to their original state. From the outside, only the entrance area and the armoured cupolas may be seen. In the entrance yard is an original sentry hut which was used during the construction of the Siegfried Line as to control access to the such sites.

Early years Antoine Richard was born in Pierrefort, Cantal, on 4 February 1802. He enlisted as a volunteer in the 1st Cuirassiers of the Guard and was sent to the √âcole nationale v√©t√©rinaire d'Alfort (National Veterinary School of Alfort) as a military student. In 1828 he was admitted as a veterinarian to the 1st Artillery. He was stationed in Strasbourg, where he attended the Faculty of Medicine and obtained a degree as a doctor. He went to Algeria, then returned to Grignon to teach rural economy. From 1832 Richard was a member of the Republican Society of the Rights of Man (Soci√©t√© des droits de l'homme). In 1838 he founded an agricultural school in the Auvergne. In 1840 he was appointed professor of natural history at the royal school of stud farming, and in 1844 he was made director of the school. In 1845 he published the Annals of stud farming and agriculture, a monthly review. In 1847 he published a remarkable work on equine conformation. His scientific doctrines and democratic leanings made him suspect by the government, and he was dismissed in 1847. Second republic Richard threw himself into the Reform movement. After the February Revolution he was sent to Saint-Flour as Deputy Commissioner of the Provisional Government. On 23 April 1848 he was elected to represent Cantal in the Constituent Assembly. He joined the moderate left. During the government of General Louis-Eug√®ne Cavaignac (28 June 1848 to 20 December 1848) he was rapporteur of the agriculture and farm credit committee of the Assembly. This committee reviewed the proposal by Agriculture Minister Charles Gilbert Tourret for agricultural education. The committee proposed various amendments. Richard noted that cultivators had long been neglected by previous regimes, and presented the project as a great revolutionary measure. Richard added the objective of instilling love of the Republic to that of instilling love of the land. Richard was re-elected for Cantal in the Legislative Assembly on 13 May 1849, sitting with the Democratic minority. Later career After the coup d'√©tat of 2 December 1851 Richard returned to private life. For the duration of the Second French Empire (1852‚Äì1870) he devoted himself to the study of agronomy. In 1854 he and Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire founded the Zoological Society of Acclimatization.

The G-BOSS is used primarily for force protection, checkpoint security, route reconnaissance, patrol over watch, improvised explosive devices emplacement detection, intelligence gathering, and personnel/vehicle identification. Ground-Based Operational Surveillance System and its various tower configurations.  Description  The G-BOSS is an integrated surveillance system, which employs the following: a multi-spectral Electro-Optic/Infrared sensor suite with multiple detection and assessment technologies in a self-contained, mobile platform. The G-BOSS has the ability to operate independently between an 80-foot or 107-foot tower. The sensor suite is composed of: a Star SAFIRE IIIFP camera composed of lasers and rangefinders, a ThermoVision 3000 camera with a Global Positioning System (GPS), a Man-portable Surveillance and Target Acquisition Radar (MSTAR). The Ground Control Station (GCS) also contains an optional Remote Ground Station (RGS). With the above technologies, the G-BOSS has the capabilities of video capture, storage, transmission, and power generation. The G-BOSS can also integrate signals from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using VideoScout management systems along with the Tactical Remote Sensor Suite (TRSS) ground sensors. The G-BOSS has 3 variants: the G-BOSS itself, the G-BOSS Lite, and the CERBERUS Lite. In 2013, U.S. Navy surveillance experts upgraded the G-BOSS system with DC-DC converters for power generation, having awarded Vicor Corporation a contract to improve the power systems. This upgrade package will include a 24-volt DC power electronics devices with 48-, 12-, and 9-volt DC outputs, 24-volt DC converters with 19.5-, 12-, and 48-volt DC outputs, and input mating connector kits.  Origins and development  The G-BOSS originated and enhanced the Rapid Aerostat Initial Deployment (RAID) system. During the Global War on Terror, these systems deployed to various Forward Operating Bases both in Iraq and Afghanistan. The basis for the RAID surveillance system was improved with the development of the G-BOSS. The G-BOSS took the concept of using elevated infrared sensors and put it on a stationary platform. In addition, the G-BOSS brought the addition of a second electro-optic/infrared sensor and a ground-based radar network located in the remote ground station. Included with the RAID towers are tethered blimp balloon systems (aerostats) as part of the Persistent Surveillance and Dissemination Systems, which later developed into the current G-BOSS system. The system employs a variety of sensors tethered from the blimp balloon system, and later evolved into other platforms, including fixed towers and relocated masts, which addressed logistical issues tested while on deployments. The predecessor to the Ground Based Operational Surveillance System.  Operational impact Considering the majority of casualties in both Iraq and Afghanistan in terms of the Global War on Terror were from improvised explosive devices (IEDs), the need for surveillance has increased with their increased use. In a move to counter this threat and lower the effectiveness of IEDs, the US Marine Corps directed the creation of a persistent surveillance system to identify and counter threats to security of military installations. The Marines requested the system be fielded as soon as possible. The result of this request was the development of the Ground Based Operational Surveillance System ready for rapid deployment to theater. The G-BOSS provides the command operations center with a round-the-clock display and tracking of items of interest through the use of high resolution night and day cameras. The cameras are integrated with enhanced target recognition and radar systems used to increase the ability to detect moving targets. The G-BOSS allows personnel to counter insurgent activities with an emphasis of disrupting placement of improvised explosive devices. The G-BOSS enhances situational awareness by allowing personnel to monitor activities in the vicinity of the military installation. Common places of surveillance include the gates, along the roads, borders, rivers, pipelines, and chokepoints, among other areas of responsibility and interest. The multiple towers of cameras and surveillance systems allows for 360-degree security with easily understood computer displays. Included on the computer displays are alarms and assessment data through overlay and window pop-ups, with 24/7 network running capability, allowing reduced manpower and hours in relation to personnel on guard. The multiple camera systems have the capability of routing all into a single remote ground system. The Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity, (MCOTEA), conducted operational tests on the G-BOSS with a simulation of the how to employ it in relation to situational awareness. From the testing of the G-BOSS, it was concluded that the most critical factor in enhancing its operational effectiveness is the positioning of the towers. The G-BOSS is best utilized in open terrain, which employs better dispersion and better performance. The tests utilized role-players and stealth techniques of insurgents to test the intuitive nature and helping to identify attempts to mask hostile intent. The key is to increase the G-BOSS operators‚Äô training and vigilance to counter the insurgency. The more use of stealth in relation to the G-BOSS that occurs, the slew rate provides a low proportion of correct identifications and vice versa. When the MSTAR is implemented, there is a detection of more agents and enhanced capabilities for correct identifications of personnel. However, in testing the underutilization of the MSTAR, it was concluded that the stand-alone G-BOSS is nearly as effective as it is without. The test finally concluded with the success rate of 76% in relation to the detection of improvised explosive devices, proving the ability to counter the threat of such devises.

History  Long used by the military as a \\"mission-critical\\" measure of the psychological readiness of troops, high morale has been shown to be a powerful driver of performance in all organizations. Extensive research demonstrates its benefits in productivity, profitability, customer satisfaction and worker health. By measuring morale with employee surveys many business owners and managers have long been aware of a direct, causative connection between that morale, (which includes job satisfaction, opinions of their management and many other aspects of the workplace culture) and the performance of their organization.  Importance and effects  Recognized as one of the major factors affecting productivity and overall financial stability of any business, low morale may lead to reduced concentration, which in turn can cause mistakes, poor customer service and missed deadlines. It also can contribute to a high turnover rate and absenteeism. Employee morale proves to be detrimental to the business in these respects. Morale can drive an organization forward or can lead to employee discontent, poor job performance, and absenteeism (Ewton, 2007). With low morale comes a high price tag. The Gallup Organization estimates that there are 22 million actively disengaged employees costing the American economy as much as $350 billion per year in lost productivity including absenteeism, illness, and other problems that result when employees are unhappy at work. Failing to address this issue lead to decreased productivity, increased rates of absenteeism and associated costs, increased conflicts in the work environment, increased customer or consumer complaints, and increased employee turnover rates and costs associated with selection and training replacement staff.  Methods of raising  Employees tend to lack motivation to perform their jobs when morale is low. A lack of motivation can also be circular in nature. Management and employees can help increase morale in the workplace by the following means. * Recognize employees * Be a respectful manager * Have one-on-one meetings with employees * Invest in employees * Get to know employees * Pay and reward systems * Job autonomy and discretion * Support services * Training See also * Job satisfaction * Employee engagement * Industrial and organizational psychology  References  Category:Employee relations Category:Psychological attitude Category:Motivation ","title":"Employee morale"},{"id":"42227080","text":"Octo was a French automobile manufactured at Courbevoie by Louis Vienne between 1921 and 1928.Linz, Schrader: Die Internationale Automobil- Enzyklop√§die.Georgano: The Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile.Georgano: Autos.

Duhamel, which was translated and published in the article on cabbages in The Complete Farmer (1777): :\\"I began by retrenching the dung; though the spot I chose for my first trial had not received any for several years. It had indeed been well prepared by ploughing the preceding year, when one half of it bore barley, and the other oats. I now made it into a bed, the middle of which was directly over the last year's furrow. I ploughed this bed on the twenty-fifth of September, 1751, in the same manner as if it had been intended for wheat. I planted on it a single row of white cabbages, which I watered to make them take root the better. The length of this bed was one hundred and sixty feet, and its breadth six feet seven inches.\\" Study of a Cabbage by Fran√ßois Boucher, 1735 :\\"That I might be able to make a just comparison between the cabbages of this bed, and those of the kitchen garden, I planted a spot of ground in the latter, the same day, with the same sort of plants. This spot had been extremely well dug, and plentifully dunged by the gardener, who took all possible care of these plants during the summer, and weeded them as often as was necessary. :\\"Instead of cabbaging, most of them ran up in height: upon which I plucked them up, and planted others in their stead.\\"The Complete Farmer (1777) p. CAB-CAB :\\"I bestowed the same care and culture on my row of cabbages in the bed, as if they had been wheat.\\" :\\"On the ninth of March 1752, the alleys were stirred with the plough. On the twenty-fifth of April, I gave them a second stirring with the cultivator. On the third of June they had a third stirring with the plough: and on the twentieth of July, I made my gardener hand-hoe them, for fear the plough should damage several stalks of wheat which grew on the next bed, and were bent, but not lodged.\\" :\\"These cabbages were never watered, except once, which was at the time of planting them; and yet they were always crisp and firm, even in the hottest days. By this easy and expeditious culture, they attained all the perfection that could be desired; and surpassed those of the kitchen-garden, as much in goodness, as they did in bulk. Most of them weighed between fifteen and eighteen pounds, and the smallest between eight and ten. The weight of all the plants which grew on this bed, was 840 pounds.\\" The Complete Farmer article comments that \\"the circumstance of the cabbages continuing firm and crisp in the hottest weather, is remarkable.\\" Yet, the work reported that a similar experiment in England upon cabbages had made the same observations, and it was explained as an effect of good and deep hoeing as predicted by Jethro Tull. = On lucerne = Lucerne is the name of the alfalfa, which arose in France, Germany and Britain in the 16th century from the Proven√ßal luzerno (\\"glow worm\\"), due to its shiny seeds. In the 1750s M. de Chateauvieux had experimented extensively on producing lucerne in beds, cultivated according to new husbandry, over several years. Most of the 25-page article on lucerne in The Complete Farmer (1777) was devoted to the outcomes of these experiments. Lucerne in Flora Batava, Jan Kops et al. (1814) Although M. de Chateauvieux agreed with M. Duhamel and other participants of the new husbandry, that lucerne and sainfoin thrive best when cultivated in beds, his practice differed in many respects from theirs. In his experiments he had some explicit expectations: :\\"Lucern grows naturally with one large perpendicular, or tap-root, which penetrates very deep into the earth, and has few, if any, lateral roots. From similar experiments on other tap-rooted plants, I was induced to think, that this too, by transplanting it, and at the same time cutting off part of its tap-root, might be made to shoot out several horizontal roots, which, reaching into the loose mould of the alleys, and extending themselves there, would collect a greater quantity of nourishment for the plant, and consequently enable it to produce more abundant crops.\\"The Complete Farmer (1777) p. LUC-LUC The lucerne he had planted pushed out numbers of large lateral roots, and these branched out again into others, which according to him \\"may be multiplied without end by frequent culture of the alleys: for the horse-hoe has the fame effect on these horizontal roots as cutting has upon the.tap-root.\\" About the method of transplanting the lucerne, M. de Chateauvieux explained: :\\"I made several beds, some about three feet wide, (including the alleys) into, which I transplanted a single row of lucerne; others about three feet nine inches, into which I transplanted two rows and others about four feet three inches wide, in which I put three rows. The design of this variation was, to see by which of these three methods the same extent of ground would produce the greatest quantity of lucerne. I believe it will require five or six years to determine exactly which of them will be best; because, as the plants increase every year in bulk, their produce alters, and may perhaps not keep in proportion to their first years, though probably the difference would not be great.\\" :\\"The plants in the single rows were six inches asunder, nor should they ever be nearer; and those in the double and triple rows, were eight or nine inches distant from each other. I must observe, that I likewise sowed lucerne with the drill, in beds, in which it has remained without transplanting. It is very fine; but not near so strong and flourishing as that which I transplanted. When lucerne is sown where it is to remain, it necessarily requires being thinned, and that operation takes up more time than transplanting it would do.\\" This led to the design of a series of rules to be observed in transplanting lucerne into beds: :# \\"The middle of the beds must be raised and arched as high as possible; and as the lucerne is to remain several years on the same ground, no pains should be spared to prepare the earth as well as can be.\\" :# \\"Lucerne should be sown in the spring, and in a rich mould, that the plants may be strong enough to transplant in September.\\" :#\\"3. Plants two or three years old may be transplanted as well as younger ones.\\" = Drill plough = J. Balfour's Select Essays on Husbandry (1767), with extracts from the Museum Rusticum and other foreign essays on agriculture, mentioned the drill-ploughs invented by M. Duhamel and M. de Chateauvieux. Drill plough in The complete Farmer, plate X :\\"The gentlemen abroad who are now promoting the new husbandry, have gone into the practice of planting three rows upon every ridge, supporting that to be the best method; and the drill-ploughs invented by M. Du Hamel, and M. de Chateauvieux, are constructed to sow three rows. Mr Mills also, the editor of M. Du Hamel's Husbandry, tells us, that he declined giving a description of Mr Tull's drill, because it was so complex, which, indeed, it was for lowing three rows; but, as it is now altered, is not so complicated as M. De Chateauvieux's drill, and is easily made a more general instrument for sowing upon ridges, or upon the level; and has this advantage beyond any of the foreign drills that I have seen, that, the two wheels which serve to turn the spindle, and deliver the seed, do, at the same time, mark the exact distances of the next rows to be drilled, upon level ground; so that a field, of any extent, may be planted with it, at the distances intended, with great exactness.\\"J. Balfour's Select Essays on Husbandry (1767) p. 250-1 Balfour concluded that \\"from the practice of the gentlemen abroad, and other instances that might be given at home, it is evident, that they have not seen the additions that Mr Tull made to his Essay, in which, besides his different method of drilling, there are several very material improvements in the manner of hoeing and cultivating wheat, and other crops; and from these last parts of his work may be also seen, that the reports of his bad success, in repeated wheat-crops, are without any just foundation.\\" Beside the drill-plough, M. de Chateauvieux also developed a single cultivator, both described in John Mills's A New System of Practical Husbandry (1767).John Mills's A New System of Practical Husbandry. Volume 5. p. 23-87; p. 129-133 & p. 148-153 These works was later reviewed by Tobias George Smollett (1775).Tobias George Smollett The Critical Review, Or, Annals of Literature, Volume 40. 1775. p. 52 In his Letters concerning the present state of the French nation (1769) Arthur Young was far less positive. He criticised the design for his complex design and lack of maintainability, stating: :\\"The drill plough, which M. de Chateauvieux recommends to his readers, and which he used himself, is a most complicate [sic] machine, infinitely difficult to make, any where, [sic] and impossible to repair in a village, besides the first cost of it, being very considerable. :It must surely appear from these circumstances that all M. de Chateauvieux proves is, that a man when he has a drill plough given him, may use it if it wants no repairs to great advantage comparatively with the common husbandry, as already set forth. But it must be very apparent that multitudes of new experiments are yet necessary to prove the New husbandry (supposing a drill plough invented as simple as possible) equal to the old, where the latter is practised in a more advantageous manner, than about M. de Chateauvieux.\\"Arthur Young Letters concerning the present state of the French nation 1769. p. 266 Two years later Young (1771) explained that among his many experiments he did make a single cultivator based on M. de Chateauvieux's instructions with some additional improvements.Arthur Young. A Course of Experimental Agriculture: Containung an Exact Register of All the Business Transacted During Five Years on Near Three Hundred Acres of Various Soils... The Whole Stated in Near Two Thousand Original Experiments.. J. Exshaw, 1771. p. 448.  Legacy  In his days M. de Ch√¢teauvieux's work on husbandry was often cited in du Monceau's A Practical Treatise of Husbandry, and in The Complete Farmer: Or, a General Dictionary of Husbandry 3rd ed. (1777). The Complete Farmer even listed M. de Ch√¢teauvieux in the subtitle of this work among the foremost authorities. Other people mentioned in this context were Carl Linnaeus, Louis Fran√ßois Henri de Menon, Hugh Plat, John Evelyn, John Worlidge, John Mortimer, Jethro Tull, William Ellis, Philip Miller, Thomas Hale, Edward Lisle, Roque, John Mills, and Arthur Young.The Complete Farmer: Or, a General Dictionary of Husbandry. 3rd ed. 1777. Over half a century later, The Penny Cyclop√¶dia (1833) gave a summary of the so-called \\"horse-hoeing husbandry\\" or \\"new husbandry\\": :\\"The influence of the atmosphere on the soil, and the increased fertility produced by pulverizing and stirring heavy lands, has led to the notion adopted by Jethro Tull, that labour might entirely supersede the necessity of manure: hence the origin of the horse-hoeing husbandry, which at one time was so highly thought of as to be called, by way of distinction, the new husbandry. Fallows and manuring were both discarded as unnecessary; the seed was sown in rows with wide intervals, which were continually kept worked and stirred. At first the result was highly satisfactory; all the humus, by exposure to the air, was converted into soluble extract, and taken up by the plants, which throve well as long as the supply lasted: but in the end it was exhausted; and the wannest admirers and supporters of Tull's system, Du Hamel and De Chateauvieux, besides many others, found to their cost, in practice, that pulverizing alone will not restore fertility. The system of drilling and horse-hoeing, when united with judicious manuring, has, however, been found a great improvement in agriculture.\\"The Penny Cyclop√¶dia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Volume 1.

Whipple House, also known as the Clough or Woodward House, is a historic house on Main Street in the center of New London, New Hampshire. Built in 1850 for a long-serving doctor, it is the only Greek Revival house in the town. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It is now the front portion of an assisted living facility. Description and history The Dr. Solomon M. Whipple House is located in the center of New London, on the south side of Main Street opposite the New London Inn. The two story wood frame house has a side gable roof, with fully pedimented gable ends with triangular vents in the tympanum area. The front facade is three bays wide, with a center entry sheltered by a portico supported by Doric columns and topped by a low railing with turned balusters. The corner boards of the house are pilastered, and the front facade is finished with flushboarding scored to resemble ashlar stone. There is an addition to the rear, which was added by Dr. Whipple but extensively altered by later occupants. A large modern addition now also provides additional space for the property's use as an assisted living facility. The house was built in 1850 for Dr. Solomon Whipple, who served for many years as the town's only physician, and remained in his family until 1941, when it was sold to another doctor. Dr. Whipple had his office in the house, and was a prominent statewide leader of the medical community, serving as president of the New Hampshire Medical Society in 1876. Whipple's children were also active in local civic affairs and business, donating Whipple Hall to the community, and establishing its first telephone company.

It publishes research articles in English and Italian. The owner of the publication is Universit√† Commerciale Luigi Bocconi and it is published by Egea, the University's publishing house.  History  = First series (Paduan series) = The inception of the journal dates back to April 1875 when the Associazione per il progresso degli studi economici in Italia decided to turn the Rassegna di agricoltura, industria e commercio of the Societ√† di incoraggiamento di Padova in its official organ. The title chosen for the new journal was Giornale degli economisti. Eugenio Forti was confirmed as its director . In the early issues of the journal writers would include Fedele Lampertico, Luigi Luzzatti, Antonio Scialoja, that is to say the most eminent names of the newly formed association.The economists congress during which the association was founded was held in Milan from 4 to 6 January 1875. Italo Magnani, Dibattito fra economisti italiani di fine Ottocento, Milano, Franco Angeli, 2003 , p.18 Giornale degli economisti first issue The main themes of the Giornale degli economisti are the social sciences, but there are also articles on economic theory. The orientation of the journal is in defense of protectionism and in favor of legislative action in the field of social security and labor protection. The most discussed issue is that of women and child labor in factories. Luzzatti, who had also sponsored an industrial survey from Italian Parliament,Italo Magnani, Dibattito fra economisti italiani di fine Ottocento, Milano, Franco Angeli, 2003 , p. 21 wrote several times on these topics.La legislazione sociale nel parlamento inglese, \\"Giornale degli economisti\\", apr. 1875 ; La libert√† economica ed il lavoro dei fanciulli e delle fanciulle nelle fabbriche, \\"Giornale degli economisti\\", ago. 1875 ; Il lavoro dei fanciulli, \\"Giornale degli economisti\\", mar. 1876 Between 1876 and 1878, the Giornale degli economisti published both a review of legislation in other European countries on women and child labor, and several investigations on the working conditions in several Italian cities. The journal, on the basis of military, health and moral considerations, called for legislative action in order to limit the work of married women and children. At least a law prohibiting employment for married women in the period immediately before and after childbirth was requested.Massimo Finoia, La Questione femminile attraverso il ¬´Giornale degli economisti¬ª, 1875‚Äì1935, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", set.-dic. 1991, p. 525-527 The journal's requests were in open opposition to the Societ√† Adam Smith's dominant liberal views as expressed in its official journal: the weekly Florentine journal L'Economista.As for the debate between the two schools see Italo Magnani, Dibattito fra economisti italiani di fine Ottocento, Milano, Franco Angeli, 2003 , p. 17-22 During those years consensus around Smithian free trade increased and the Giornale degli economisti ended up being cut off. The journal and its economists were perceived as austere but antiquated, \\"dressed up in winter clothes during summer weather.\\"Tullio Bagiotti, Storia della Universit√† Bocconi, Milano, Universit√† Bocconi, 1952, p. 178 As a consequence, in 1879, only four years after its inception, the publication of the Giornale degli economisti ended. = Second series (Bologna and Rome series) = Publication of the Giornale degli economisti resumed in Bologna in 1886 by Alberto Zorli. Zorli was then lecturer in public finance at the University of Bologna, and there had the idea to start up the Padua journal once again. According to his plans, \\"while remaining faithful to the principles of the Padua journal, this Bologna journal would particularly aim to settle controversies among economists, and to become a real gym for all opinions but subversive opinions.\\"Alberto Zorli, Breve storia della prima serie del \\"Giornale degli economisti\\" di Roma, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", gen.-feb. 1939, p. 110 The new journal would soon receive support by many of the leading Italian economists. The frequency went from bi-monthly to monthly and a few years later the management of the journal moved to Rome, even though printing continued to rely on the Fava & Garagnani typography in Bologna. The aim of the new series was increasingly to promote a comparison between protectionists and free traders. Next to protectionists Eugenio Forti and Fedele Lampertico, the Giornale degli economisti added new signatures of the Societ√† Adam Smith founder Tullio Martello and the brilliant young liberal Maffeo Pantaleoni. Pantaleoni worked on the journal's financial review page as well.Italo Magnani, Dibattito fra economisti italiani di fine Ottocento, Milano, Franco Angeli, 2003 , p. 125 The conciliatory formula for \\"gym of ideas\\" proved successful and after a few years the Giornale degli economisti ceased to be unprofitable.Alberto Zorli, Breve storia della prima serie del \\"Giornale degli economisti\\" di Roma, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", gen.-feb. 1939,p. 110 But soon the journal's editorial line changed. In 1890 Zorli was joined in management by Maffeo Pantaleoni, Antonio De Viti De Marco and Ugo Mazzola, the three of them also acquiring 3/4 of the journal's property. The three had long entertained the idea of creating a new journal close to the Marginalist economic school of which the three of them were members. They decided, however, to give up the idea, focusing instead upon the Zorli journal.Italo Magnani, Dibattito fra economisti italiani di fine Ottocento, Milano, Franco Angeli, 2003 , p. 54-55 The difference in orientation between the directors was evident and soon Zorli would end up being more and more marginalized. In short, the first director realized that he was \\"a fish out of water,\\" the newspaper got out of his hand and the proximity to Marginalism became more marked each year.Zorli writes \\"In the fifth year [...] decided to associate in the direction of the journal the active work of other colleagues, and so I joined a few personal friends, especially to Maffeo Pantaleoni, trusting that he would help me maintain the character of the Journal as a scientific gym; but in the long run I realized in the journal I was becoming like ... a fish out of water, as the Journal each year more and more accentuated its new character of a single organ of propaganda, propaganda that the English school\\", Alberto Zorli, Breve storia della prima serie del \\"Giornale degli economisti\\" di Roma, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", gen.-feb. 1939, p. 111 The political orientation of the Giornale degli economisti changed as well. It became liberal, anti-protectionist and anti-socialist. The journal supported the positions of the Associazione economica liberale italiana whose president was Pantaleoni. Editors of the Giornale degli economisti opposed the customs tariffOn the opposition articles: Maffeo Pantaleoni, Come il governo volendo giovare all'industria vinicola sia riuscito a danneggiarla, \\"Giornale degli economisti\\", ago. 1890 ; Antonio De Viti de Marco, La fallacia di una legislazione internazionale limitatrice del lavoro, \\"Giornale degli economisti\\", ago. 1890 and the traditional historical left's trade wars with France. They sympathized with Napoleone Colajanni and the extreme political leftItalo Magnani, Dibattito fra economisti italiani di fine Ottocento, Milano, Franco Angeli, 2003 , p. 70 in contrast with Francesco Crispi. They fought strenuously against Crispi during the Banca Romana scandal.Italo Magnani, Dibattito fra economisti italiani di fine Ottocento, Milano, Franco Angeli, 2003 , p. 70-109 There was a new purpose in style as well: the journal was committed to \\"dealing with as much as [we can] topical issues of art and economic, with special attention to the problems of economic policy that are stirred up in Italy [...] pure science is not excluded. It is simply not at the forefront\\".From a letter by Pantaleoni. Cit. in Italo Magnani, Dibattito fra economisti italiani di fine Ottocento, Milano, Franco Angeli, 2003 p. 70 Consistent with the new line, a new Cronaca politica page was inserted into the journal. The page was edited by Mazzola first and then, from 1893, by Vilfredo Pareto. During those years, the most successful period of the Giornale degli economisti began. Yet both Pareto and Pantaleoni suffered oppositions and hostilities in their academic careers for their anti- government and intransigent positions in the journal.Italo Magnani, Dibattito fra economisti italiani di fine Ottocento, Milano, Franco Angeli, 2003 , p. 90-97 Fellowship between the authors that had made the success of the Giornale degli economisti broke during last years of the century. Mazzola died in 1899, when he was only 35 years old, Pantaleoni started to walk away,Pantaleoni writes to Colajanni on April, 16th, 1897: \\"My relationship with Giornale degli economisti is not as before. De Viti runs the journal and runs it as he wants.\\" Italo Magnani, Dibattito fra economisti italiani di fine Ottocento, Milano, Franco Angeli, 2003 , p. 209 and Pareto's collaboration stopped as well after being accused for his Cronaca politica page \\"of injuring rather than reasoning, and therefore unconvincing.\\"This is De Viti De Marco's judgment. Italo Magnani, Dibattito fra economisti italiani di fine Ottocento, Milano, Franco Angeli, 2003 , p. 209 Starting in 1897 De Viti De Marco remained virtually the only director of the journal. The journal's editorial policy was revised, only short articles were published with issues not exceeding 90 pages. Furthermore, the Giornale degli economisti lessened the liberalism that had distinguished it in recent years. So wide was the change that, during 1900, in part due to looming financial difficulties, a merger with the journal that for many years had been opposing it seemed possible: La riforma sociale.Italo Magnani, Dibattito fra economisti italiani di fine Ottocento, Milano, Franco Angeli, 2003 , p. 260 = Third series (Rome Series) = In the first decade of the twentieth century the journal, increasingly less committed to political analysis, opened its pages to the collaboration of a new generation of scholars. In 1910 the ownership of the journal was purchased by Alberto Beneduce and Giorgio Mortara, who, together with Pantaleoni, would also assume the journal management. This is how the third series of the journal started, and to the title \\"Rivista di statistica\\" was added. And it is quite understandable: both Beneduce that Mortara were statisticians and the use of quantitative methods for dealing with economic problems was increasing. Beneduce had started to work with the journal in 1904, with articles on demography and statistics. Then, attracted by politics, he walked away from academic studies and from the journal, even if formally retaining its co-direction. Mortara instead kept on directing the journal and managed to move it out of the difficult financial period following the First World War.Libero Lenti, Il ¬´Giornale degli economisti¬ª compie cento anni, \\"Nuova Antologia\\", ott.-dic. 1986, fasc. 2160,, p. 102 Despite budget difficulties Mortara managed to keep up the international scientific prestige of the journal while managing to attract new famous foreign collaborators such as Eugen Slutsky.Eugen Slutsky, Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore, \\"Giornale degli economisti\\", lug. 1915 = Fourth series (Milan series) = Meanwhile, in 1922 Mortara moved from Rome to Milan, where he was called to teach in the new Faculty of Law at the University of Milan and then to direct the statistical institute at Bocconi University.Libero Lenti, Il ¬´Giornale degli economisti¬ª compie cento anni, \\"Nuova Antologia\\", ott.-dic. 1986, fasc. 2160, p. 102 The journal management would then be moved to Milan, starting the third series of the journal in 1923. A double mourning almost immediately marked the new series. In 1924, in fact both the main contributors of Giornale degli economisti died: Pantaleoni and Pareto. Two special commemorative issues would be published in memory of them.Gen.-feb. 1924 ; mar. 1925 Instead of Pantaleoni, the journal's management would be taken over by Gustavo Del Vecchio, while the journal shares owned by the Pantaleoni went to his daughter Marcella Tommasini Pantaleoni.Libero Lenti, Il ¬´Giornale degli economisti¬ª compie cento anni, \\"Nuova Antologia\\", ott.-dic. 1986, fasc. 2160, p. 102 Like all Italian publishing , after Fascist laws regarding the press, the journal was forced to compromise and take particular precautions. Some articles were clearly similar to the policies of the Fascist regime. In any case, the independence of articles of a more technical nature, such as those regarding Statistics, managed to be safeguarded. Even without exposing itself too much, the Giornale degli economisti continued to host even opponents of the regime. Antonio Graziadei, Ugo La Malfa, and even Ferruccio Parri collaborated with the journal ‚Äì the latter signed with the initials FP or under the pseudonym \\"Any reader\\".Libero Lenti, Il ¬´Giornale degli economisti¬ª compie cento anni, \\"Nuova Antologia\\", ott.-dic. 1986, fasc. 2160, p. 103-104 The Gionale degli economisti's formula of cautious independence seemed to work and during the years of the regime publication of the journal was allowed without major interference until 1938, when a particularly difficult period began for the Giornale degli economisti.Libero Lenti, Il ¬´Giornale degli economisti¬ª compie cento anni, \\"Nuova Antologia\\", ott.-dic. 1986, fasc. 2160, p. 103 In the fall of that year the enforcement of racial laws forced the removal of teachers of Jewish origin from schools and universities. Many at Bocconi hoped for smooth application of the law.Luigi Filippo De Magistris, teacher of geography at Bocconi University wrote in a letter: \\"If I understand the spirit of the defense, other Jews in Italy are not wanted. Those already being here shouldn't worry. [...] Why should you worry about the friend Mortara?\\" Marzio A. Romani, 1938: un anno difficile per Giovanni Demaria e per il Giornale degli economisti, in: Giovanni Demaria e l'economia del Novecento. Milano, Universit√† Bocconi, 1999, p. 49 Instead, both Del Vecchio and Mortara had to be removed from Bocconi University and from the Giornale degli economisti. The first reaction was Mortara to think of closing the Journal. He could not bear the idea that the Giornale degli economisti would fall into the hands of those who had wanted the racial laws: \\"Alongside the four children who followed him to Brazil, there was a son of intellect that he could not migrate, and it was the Journal. The Mortara's impulse was to suppress it.\\"This is the view by P. Baffi, in: Antonio D'Aroma, Luigi Einaudi, Il ¬´Giornale degli economisti¬ª e la Bocconi, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", 1984, fasc. 9/10, p. 587-618, p. 599 Mortara wrote: \\"I hope to see Beneduce within one month and convert him to the thesis of euthanasia for the Giornale degli economisti. It seems to me the only dignified solution: hara-kiri in Japanese. \\"Antonio D'Aroma, Luigi Einaudi, Il ¬´Giornale degli economisti¬ª e la Bocconi, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", 1984, fasc. 9/10, p. 587-618, p. 599 A statement addressed to subscribers was added to the November‚ÄìDecember 1938 issue. It announced the ceasing of publication. As a justification on the last page a communication read: \\"the work of Italian economists was lost in recent years, in too many review journals.\\"\\"Giornale degli economisti\\", nov.-dic. 1938 Still the same communication announced that Mortara and the journal management board had authorized Bocconi University to add to its Annali di economia the subtitle Giornale degli economisti.Aldo Montesano, Giovanni Demaria e il Giornale degli economisti, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", dic. 1998, p. 291 But many economists close to the Fascist regime intended to take over the journal. The most interested seem to be three intellectuals close to the regime: Alberto De Stefani, Luigi Amoroso and Felice Vinci. The three ran the Rivista italiana di scienze economiche which, since its founding years in the thirties, had not been particularly fortunate.Aldo Montesano, Giovanni Demaria e il Giornale degli economisti, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", dic. 1998, p. 291 Therefore the opportunity to merge it with Giornale degli economisti seemed very attractive.Libero Lenti, Il ¬´Giornale degli economisti¬ª compie cento anni, \\"Nuova Antologia\\", ott.-dic. 1986, fasc. 2160, p. 106 The journal in De Stefani's plans was supposed to become the organ of a newly formed economic society that he would direct. However, the intervention of Giovanni Gentile, vice president of Bocconi University during those years, with his authority would ward off De Stefani's plans.Aldo Montesano, Giovanni Demaria e il Giornale degli economisti, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", dic. 1998,, p. 291 Gentile had moved following an opposite plan compared to the operation imagined by Mortara. In the merger of the Giornale degli economisti and Annali di economia the former would no longer have to cease publication, but the latter.Marco Cattini, Enrico Decleva, Aldo De Maddalena, Marzio A. Romani, Storia di una libera Universit√†. v. 2: l'Universit√† commerciale Luigi Bocconi dal 1915 al 1945, Milano, Egea, 1997, p. 220-221 The Giornale degli economisti would be transferred, free of any charge, to Bocconi University. Thereby safeguarding the name of the journal with the longest tradition and providing a solution preserving its independence and scientific rigor. The first to accept the plan was Del Vecchio, followed by Mortara and Beneduce. The more reluctant to accept was the daughter of Pantaleoni, still co-owner of the journal, who stubbornly defended closing the journal as the best way to defend her father's journal from fascist ambitions.Marzio A. Romani, 1938: un anno difficile per Giovanni Demaria e per il Giornale degli economisti, in: Giovanni Demaria e l'economia del Novecento. Milano, Universit√† Bocconi, 1999, p. 50-55 Equally important was the strong support of the operation by Bocconi University Rector Giovanni Demaria, who directed the new series starting in 1939, now called Giornale degli economisti' e Annali di economia. = New series (Bocconi University) = The first months of the new series seemed to be going well,Del Vecchio enjoyed new series first issues. Joseph A. Schumpeter wrote to Demaria that he considered the journal \\"one of the 3 or 4 first scientific periodicals in the world\\". Marzio A. Romani, 1938: un anno difficile per Giovanni Demaria e per il Giornale degli economisti, in: Giovanni Demaria e l'economia del Novecento. Milano, Universit√† Bocconi, 1999, p. 54 but with the start of the war the Giornale degli economisti came into collision with Fascism. The economic policy of the regime became the target of growing criticism by increasingly less veiled articles. Articles in this sense appeared signed by Costantino Bresciani Turroni and Luigi Einaudi.Costantino Bresciani Turroni, La funzione del regime aureo e del regime dei \\"clearings\\" e la ricostruzione dei rapporti commerciali internazionali, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", lug.-ago. 1941, p. 418-457 ; Luigi Einaudi, Intorno alla disciplina degli impianti industriali, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", lug.-ago. 1941, p. 458-470 Agostino Lanzillo wrote about the probability of defeat in the economic conditions in which Italy was entering the war.Critical articles appeared in Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia during this period were: Preliminari ad un'economia di guerra, set.-ott. 1939, p. 669-680 ; Il comunismo e la guerra, mar.-apr. 1940, p. 182-189 ; Blocchi e monete : considerazioni monetarie attuali, mag.-giu. 1941, p. 292-307 But there were two articles, one by DemariaGiovanni Demaria, Il problema industriale italiano, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", set.-ott. 1941, p. 516-552 and especially one by Epicarmo Corbino,Epicarmo Corbino, Gli effetti della seconda guerra mondiale sul naviglio mondiale mercantile e previsioni per il dopoguerra, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", mar.-apr. 1941, p. 109-118 which raised the regime's hackles against the Giornale degli economisti.Tullio Bagiotti, Storia della Universit√† Bocconi, Milano, Universit√† Bocconi, 1952, p. 183 Corbino's analysis of merchant vessels was merciless: in the event of a long war the Japanese and the Italian navy were likely to decline to a negligible entity, while the Anglo-American would present a net increase starting in 1943. To worsen the situation, there was a radio broadcast of American propaganda, intercepted by Italian security services, in which Corbino's article was widely quoted.Marco Cattini, Enrico Decleva, Aldo De Maddalena, Marzio A. Romani, Storia di una libera Universit√†. v. 2: l'Universit√† commerciale Luigi Bocconi dal 1915 al 1945, Milano, Egea, 1997, p. 228 Thus, when in May 1942 Demaria's speech during a conferenceConvegno sui problemi economici dell'\\"Ordine nuovo\\" (Pisa, May 1942) where Demaria gave a speech entitled L'\\"Ordine nuovo\\" e il problema industriale italiano del dopoguerra attacked Fascist autarky and proposed the return to economic freedom and an opening to international trade, the regime's reaction was prompt. Demaria' s report was not published among the conference proceedings and the direction of the Giornale degli economisti, starting from the July‚ÄìAugust 1942 issue, was entrusted to Bocconi University Rector Paolo Greco.Aldo Montesano, Giovanni Demaria e il Giornale degli economisti, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", dic. 1998, p. 293 The change of direction was not enough to guarantee tranquility to the Giornale degli economist e Annali di economia. Following a review signed \\"GD\\"G.D. [Giovanni Demaria], review to Pergolesi, Orientamenti sociali delle costituzioni contemporanee, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", mag.-giu. 1942, p. 284-285 the journal was seized \\"for anti-patriotic American propaganda\\" and the consequences for Demaria would have been even worse had it not been for the Gentile's intervention with Bottai and Mussolini.Marco Cattini, Enrico Decleva, Aldo De Maddalena, Marzio A. Romani, Storia di una libera Universit√†. v. 2: l'Universit√† commerciale Luigi Bocconi dal 1915 al 1945, Milano, Egea, 1997, p. 229 The publication of the Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia resumed in 1946. The numbering shown on the first issue is January / February 1943-January/February 1946 in order to emphasize the continuity after its suspension. Demaria came back to management. The Giornale degli economisti after World War II was able to attract many foreign scholars and to internationalize its research. Since the seventies, contributions written in English increased constantly.Aldo Montesano, Giovanni Demaria e il Giornale degli economisti, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", dic. 1998, p. 295 Articles by Franco Modigliani, Duncan Black, Jan Tinbergen, Fran√ßois roux, Gerhard Tintner, Fritz Machlup, Oskar Morgenstern appeared in the journal. Of great importance in 1952 would be a report by Marco FannoMarco Fanno, Le teorie delle fluttuazioni economiche, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", set.-ott. 1952, p. 533-570 at the first meeting of the Societ√† italiana degli economisti and an article by Bruno De FinettiBruno de Finetti, Sulla preferibilit√†, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", nov.-dic. 1952, p. 685-709 introducing the Arrow-Pratt's theorem.Aldo Montesano, Giovanni Demaria e il Giornale degli economisti, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", dic. 1998, p. 294 In 1956 Demaria's report to the second meeting of Societ√† italiana degli economisti was published, in which the external causation of economic cycles was theorized. From this report and a subsequent article the Ricerche di cinematica storica would originate, produced by working groups of students and partially published in the Giornale degli economist e Annali di economia from 1964 to 1973.Aldo Montesano, Giovanni Demaria e il Giornale degli economisti, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", dic. 1998, p. 294 After the withdrawal of Demaria in 1976, the management of the Giornale degli economist e Annali di economia was taken on by Innocenzo Gasparini, who had succeeded Demaria as professor of Economic Policy. Gasparini had started working with the Giornale degli economisti in 1947 with the article Nota critica sulla tesi hayekiana dell'effetto di Ricardo,Innocenzo Gasparini, Nota critica sulla tesi hayekiana dell'effetto di Ricardo, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", gen.-feb. 1947, p. 75-82 and entrusted to the Journal an article Considerazioni sul ruolo dell'imprenditorialit√†, published a few months before his death in 1985.Innocenzo Gasparini, Considerazioni sul ruolo dell'imprenditorialit√†, \\"Giornale degli economisti e Annali di economia\\", nov./dic. 1984, p. 851-860 Gasparini's successor was Mario Monti who had been a student of his.Libero Lenti, Il ¬´Giornale degli economisti¬ª compie cento anni, \\"Nuova Antologia\\", ott.-dic. 1986, fasc. 2160, p. 111 After Monti, the journal directors would be Franco Bruni and Michele Polo. In recent years, all Giornale degli economist e Annali di economia articles appear in English. The main areas of interest are now: 1 - economic policy issues of importance to the Italian economic debate 2 - Critical Studies on recent developments in the theoretical and empirical literature.\\"The journal welcomes submissions in two areas [‚Ä¶] 1 Economic policy issues relevant for Italy [‚Ä¶] 2 Critical surveys of recent developments in the theoretical and empirical literature.\\" The journal is open to economists of any movement.

CRN's current president and CEO is Steve M. Mister.  History  The Council for Responsible Nutrition was established in 1973 in Washington, D.C.  Membership  CRN represents more than 100 companies that manufacture dietary ingredients and/or dietary supplements, or supply services to those suppliers and manufacturers. CRN‚Äôs member companies produce a large portion of the dietary supplements marketed in the United States and globally. Its member companies manufacture popular national brands as well as the store brands marketed by major supermarkets, drug stores and discount chains. These products also include those marketed through natural food stores and mainstream direct selling companies. CRN member companies are expected to comply with a host of federal and state regulations governing dietary supplements in the areas of manufacturing, marketing, quality control and safety. Its supplier and manufacturer member companies also agree to adhere to additional voluntary guidelines as well as to CRN‚Äôs Code of Ethics.  Activities CRN sponsors two annual events. The Conference: CRN‚Äôs Annual Symposium for the Dietary Supplement Industry, is an event for the dietary supplement industry, and The Workshop: CRN‚Äôs Day of Science is an event for scientists interested in nutrition and dietary supplement scientific research. In February 2019 Scott Gottlieb said that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration needed stronger powers over health claims for food supplements and the FDA warned a dozen companies to stop claiming their products can cure diseases. The Council opposed any suggestion that the sector needed stronger regulation. Affiliate organizations CRN has two affiliate organizations. The CRN Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization, representing the dietary supplement industry, whose mandate is to provide consumers with information about responsible use of dietary supplements, and to provide researchers and healthcare practitioners with education on the proper role of supplements in a healthy lifestyle. CRN-I is an international arm of the CRN whose mission is to provide science-based information to regulators, health care professionals, and the media, particularly those outside the United States, supporting the safety and benefit of dietary ingredients and dietary/food supplements, and to promote sound nutrition and food safety policies well-grounded in science.

It is home to the 30 operative F-16 fighters of the RDAF along with a T-17 Saab Supporter, and a single search and rescue helicopter covering southern Denmark. A total of 1000 people work at the fighter wing serving in the three groups Wing Staff, Operations Group and Maintenance Group. The air base covers an area of 838 hectares with three runways with a length of 3,500 meters.http://forsvaret.dk/wskp/Pages/default.aspx History The air base was constructed during the German occupation of Denmark as Fliegerhorst Hadersleben in 1943 as part of the atlantic wall. The air base was designed to base 24 Heinkel He 177 bombers and a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109 or Focke-Wulf 190 fighters, along with a series of training and reconnaissance aircraft. Due to shortages in material and later alterations of the atlantic defence, the intended flights were never based at Skrydstrup. Instead, various smaller units of minesweepers, transport planes and training units used the air base in the last years of the occupation. After the war the air base was used as a camp for German refugees. In 1953 the Royal Danish Air Force decided to expand the runways to 3000 meters making it possible to base jet aircraft in Skrydstrup. =Squadron 730= In 1954, squadron 730 was established by the Danish ministry of defence and based at Skrydstrup. The squadron consisted of F-84G Thunderjets facing 10 crashes until their replacement in 1961 by F-100 Super Sabre, forming the core of the squadron for more than 20 years. In the mid-1970s the Super Sabres caused a series of crashes leading to a total grounding of the squadron for more than four months. Mechanical investigations revealed engine failures which were fixed and improved by 1977. But at this time preparations were being made to replace the Super Sabres with the new F-16 Fighting Falcon, which arrived at Skrydstrup in January 1980. =Deployment abroad= The introduction of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon changed the physical setup at the air base as it was fit only for air defence, air policing, and air-to-surface attacks. The capability to perform long-range attacks and deploy aircraft around the world dominated the new setup instead of the traditional defensive structure. As a result, the first Danish military aircraft were deployed in the Red Flag exercise in Nevada in 1984. Since then, the squadron has been deployed in a series of military conflicts including Operation Allied Force in 1999, Operation Enduring Freedom in 2002, Operation Unified Protector in Libya in 2011 and seven F-16AM based at Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base in Kuwait to fight the Islamic State forces (ISIS / ISIL) in October 2014.

In trying to package a commercially entertaining film with an underlying philosophical message, the movie ends up being neither entertaining nor profound.\\" Expanding, they offered that the film \\"is a predictable fare that has revenge plot - often seen in Telugu films and doesn't offer anything new. The element of surprise is missing from the narration and it meanders aimlessly.\\" They noted that in a revenge-drama \\"the protagonist's moves to counter goons should be meticulously etched but that was badly missing,\\" and offered that the plot line was illogical, the film's sequences looked uninteresting, and the romance between Ramudu (Arjun Kalyan) and Janaki (Sumona Chanda) was dull and failed to make an impression. Filmibeat noted filmmaker AK Kambhampati's \\"passion, dedication and hard work are clearly visible in his debut directorial venture\\", and while he had \\"an amazing grip over\\" the film's tempo, and despite the film having a unique theme and a beautiful message, he failed to execute it on the screen. It was granted that the film's first half offered racy narration, \\"with a couple romantic songs and a few rib-tickling comedy sequences\\", but it hit rough patches during the second half \\"where its narration turns damn slow and a few dragging scenes might even bore the viewers\\", working to its detriment. Arjun Kalyan, the lead, delivered a decent performance, but he has still long way to go to prove his metal. 123Telugu offered that the film had a good concept but a bad execution. Pluses included the film's concept \\"of ‚Äò selfless donations ‚Äò and charity without expecting anything in return have been dealt with nicely.\\" Actor Dr. M. Balayya was praised for delivering \\"a classy and restrained performance\\". Newcomer Arjun Kalyan was \\"ok as the male lead\\", but needs to become relaxed and more comfortable in future roles. Vennela Kishore was entertaining in his role of movie reviewer, and RJ Ghajini was god in his role of an aspiring film director. Comedy scenes in the film's first half were good and \\"the song ‚ÄòPuttadi Bomma‚Äô was shot beautifully.\\" Film deficits include newcomer Sumona Chanda being a poor casting choice for the female lead, as it was felt \\"she does not have the kind of face that appeals to Telugu viewers.\\" Further, the senior actors led by Goutham Raju were irritating and their comedy scenes seemed poorly written. Soundtrack In January 2013, it was announced that Chinna Cinema was \\"gearing up for audio launch\\".

At the end of the 18th century, Plaza de Espa√±a or Plaza Nueva was built right next to it by Vitorian architect Justo Antonio de Olaguibel.

In 2007 the flowers that were in the middle of it were removed and fountains were installed in order to modernize the square. Virgen Blanca Festivities At 6:00 pm, Celedon's descent is performed from the top of the Church of San Miguel to a balcony across the Virgen Blanca square, where Celed√≥n (a rag doll with an umbrella) slides all the way down suspended by a wire. Meanwhile the citizens stand below it, showering themselves in champagne and singing Celed√≥n's song. Once he reaches the balcony the staff hide the rag doll and a human Celed√≥n appears. Next up, he has to cross the square, helped by a group of friends, to reach the Church of San Miguel and greet the crowds below and wish everyone a happy celebration.

I thought she‚Äôd be a natural.\\" Harvey contributed an origin story for World of Wakanda's revolutionary leader Zenzi, and has said she was inspired by the example of Winnie Mandela.

History The breed originates from Asia Minor. It came to Hungary at the end of the 18th century through the Balkans and Romania, Its name originates from the Romanian word √æig√°ie. Tsigai has become widely bred for three different purposes: its meat, milk and soft wool. Many Transylvanian farmers changed their previous sheep stocks to Tsigai, because of the popularity of its wool. Although it was originally a mountain breed, it adapted well to lowland conditions. Most of the Tsigais were kept between the Danube and the Tisza, In Hungary the Tsigai flocks are small, whereas in Moldova it is the leading breed of sheep, and is also important in Romania and Slovakia. Properties The male Tsigai can grow horns, but this is rare. Generally the sheep has long dangling ears, white wool with some black thread, and its legs and head are black or dark brown. Its skin is dark and the body parts which are covered with keratin are dark grey. The tsigai only lambs once a year, and rarely bears twins. There are two different breeds of Tsigai: =\\"Old\\" or native Tsigai= * The \\"old\\" breed is bred for its milk, meat and wool, which is used in textile industry. * The male tsigai's shoulder height is 75‚Äì80 cm and the female's 60‚Äì65 cm. * Milked for 5‚Äì6 months, this breed yields 40-60 liters of milk. The lambs are sandy grey in colour. * In the K√∂r√∂s-Maros National Park and in private breeders' farms there are around 10,000 females and 50 males in Hungary. =Domestic Tsigai= * The domestic breed is bred for its milk. * Its body size is much bigger than the \\"old\\" Tsigai: the male's shoulder height is 90‚Äì100 cm and the female's 75‚Äì80 cm. * In the milking period it yields 110-120 litres of milk. * Lambs are born with black fleece. * From 1999 it has been recorded as a separate breed, and has been a protected breed since 2008.

Rutland Shortly after its opening in 2003 Rutland High School became a rival of Crawford County, due to the proximity of the two schools and Rutland's inclusion in Region 5-AA (Crawford's region in the GHSA at the time). The rivalry continued in football for four years until Rutland was reclassified as AAA and was moved out of the region. The two schools still compete at times in baseball, basketball, softball, and wrestling.

In his pre- War piano music, he excelled as a miniaturist in descriptive, programmatic music. After joining a group of Breton composers, he developed a reputation as a \\"Celtic\\" composer, drawing on his Irish heritage, writing in a style that was unique in a French as well as an Irish context. Even though he has been almost forgotten after 1950, his music was applauded by contemporary French music critics including Henri Collet, Louis Vuillemin, √âmile Vuillermoz and Lucien Chevaillier.For Collet and Chevaillier, see items in Bibliography and elsewhere; for Vuillemin, see reviews in Comoedia, particularly during 1911‚Äì1913, accessible via Gallica; for Vuillermoz, see Comoedia, 4 Mai 1914, Excelsior, 9 March 1925, etc. In some works, he used jazz elements and took inspiration from funfairs and industrial noise, anticipating trends associated with the group of \\"Les Six\\".Axel Klein: Bird of Time. The Music of Swan Hennessy (Mainz: Schott Music, 2019), pp. 186, 300-302, 347-359. Biography Swan Hennessy was born in Rockford, Illinois, of Irish origin and grew up in Chicago. His father, Michael David Hennessy (1837‚Äì1919), was a Cork-born former President of the Chicago City Railways before he became a lawyer in 1874.Guy Ferchault in MGG (1957) describes him as an Irish lawyer; for Baker's Dictionary (2001) he was an \\"Irish-American settler\\"; see Klein, Bird of Time, p. 21. Hennessy's mother was Sarah J. Swan (c.1833‚Äì1880), a daughter of Joseph Rockwell Swan, an Ohio Supreme Court judge and founding member of the American Republican Party.Klein, Bird of Time, p. 23‚Äì4. Before 1870 the family moved to Chicago, where Hennessy grew up. There is no proof for the assertion in Baker's Dictionary that he studied \\"general subjects\\" in Oxford, but he may briefly have attended one of the (private) public schools there, before pursuing musical studies in Germany at the Stuttgart Conservatory, 1879‚Äì86. Hennessy studied composition in an English-speaking class with the American teacher Percy Goetschius as well as piano with the German teacher Edmund Alwens.Klein, Bird of Time, p. 29‚Äì33. Upon completing his studies, Hennessy moved to London (1886‚Äì92) where he was married with two children and divorced (1893). Ten years of travel followed, including France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Ireland, with a home base in Italy, before he settled in Paris around 1903.Klein, Bird of Time, p. 61. In July 1909, Hennessy was married with Claire, n√©e Przybyszewska (1883‚Äì1947), a Polish national he had met in Brussels. Her mother was a cousin of the Symbolist writer Stanis≈Çaw Przybyszewski. The couple's son Patrice Hennessy (1910‚Äì1973) later became a well-known man of letters and an expert on the French Revolution. Although not from Brittany, Hennessy was a member of the short-lived Association des Compositeurs Breton before World War I and continued to mix with their members including Paul Le Flem, Paul Ladmirault, Maurice Duhamel, Louis Aubert, Louis Vuillemin, Lucien Haudebert and others throughout the 1920s. Hennessy's public recognition in France mainly began with his association.Klein, Bird of Time, p. 195. During the early 1920s, Hennessy also enjoyed a brief period when he had several performances in IrelandKlein, Bird of Time, chapter 8, pp. 249ff. following the first performance of his String Quartet No. 2, Op. 49 (1920) at the January 1922 World Congress of the Irish Race in Paris. The quartet is dedicated to the memory of the Irish revolutionary Terence MacSwiney.Klein, Bird of Time, p. 261‚Äì9. Hennessy died in 1929 from an embolic following a routine operation;Comoedia, 28 October 1929, p. 3. the composer Georges Migot held the funeral speech.Journal des d√©bats, 3 November 1929, p. 4.; documented in Klein, Bird of Time, p. 415‚Äì6. Hennessy and his family are buried on Montparnasse Cemetery, Paris, division 28, section III. Music Swan Hennessy's music before 1900 was heavily influenced by his conservative education and his teachers' predilection for the music of Robert Schumann. Around the time of his move to Paris, he also been an admirer of Max Reger. Although his later music shows the influence of several contemporary stylistic directions, he never shook off this profound influence of the German Romantics. During the period 1907 to 1913, Hennessy wrote increasingly in an Impressionist style, with a prolific series of piano works and art songs in a descriptive and programmatic style inspired by sounds in his environment including nature, traffic, and industry. He also excelled in humoristic and satirical pieces, similar to but independent from Satie. One contemporary critic wrote, \\"Il fut un humoriste d'une verve drue dont la dr√¥lerie √©tait faite √† la fois d'observation et d'invention, de fantaisie et de psychologie.\\" (\\"He was a humourist of great verve whose humour derived from observation and invention, fantasy and psychology\\").L'Europ√©en, as above. However, despite favourable reviews in the French and German musical press, he initially did not succeed in having his music performed. This changed only after his membership in the Association des Compositeurs Bretons from 1912 and the integration of elements from the traditional music of Ireland, Scotland and Brittany into his compositions. Interrupted by World War I (which he spent near Montreux in Switzerland), he developed his Celtic leanings especially during the 1920s. Many of Hennessy's pieces with titles ending on terms like \\"celtique\\", \\"ga√©lique\\" or \\"irlandais\\" are inspired by traditional folk melody and rhythms, but he rarely quotes actual folktunes. In the course of the 1920s he wrote most of his chamber music, including several dueos, trios and quartets. These earned him the reputation of a \\"Celtic\\" composer to the extent that his original pre-War piano music became forgotten. In a French obituary, he was called \\"le barde de l'Irlande\\" and is credited as having saved \\"l'ancienne m√©lodie celtique\\".L'Europ√©en, 12 February 1930, p. 3. Hennessy was very critical of the contemporary avant-garde, particularly of Arnold Schoenberg, and wrote numerous sarcastic and pessimistic letters and comments in the musical press. For him, a solution to what he perceived as a crisis was a turn to regional traditions of folk music and to incorporate these into works of art music. From the time Hennessy lived in Paris, his music was largely published by E. Demets and from 1923 by Max Eschig (who had taken over Demets). Other publishers included Augener (London) and Schott (Mainz). Selected works For a full list of compositions, see List of compositions by Swan Hennessy.

It is one of three high schools in Catoosa County, and is operated by the Catoosa County Schools district. The school's teams are known as the Warriors.School website Lakeview Fort Oglethorpe High School is a team in the Region 6-AAA.  History  Around the time of World War I, the Lakeview community was opened for settlement by the Chattanooga Land Company. Prior to 1915, the children of this community were either taught at home, or at the Old Chambers Homeplace. By the fall of 1915, a community school for grades 1-7 was scheduled to open, but was not completed until 1916. In the 1920s, a new school building for Lakeview was built on Oak Street including its first bell, and in 1928 its first cafeteria was built. A member of the first senior class to graduate from the new building (in 1935), S. O. Addison, chose the school colors of red and white, wrote the alma mater, and picked the name \\"Warriors.\\" Two sports were initially offered at the school - baseball and basketball. Basketball games were originally held outdoor, but later, Lake Winnepesaukah and area churches allowed Lakeview to play basketball indoors in their facilities. In 1933, the 6th Cavalry donated football equipment, and the school established its first football team as well as a school newspaper. By 1951, Lakeview Junior High and High had moved to Cross Street, and in 1973, the high school was moved to 2A where the Lakeview and Ft. Oglethorpe communities merged. The community pitched in to raise fund for the athletic fields, and students and parents helped do the work. In 2013, an athletic facility project was completed, including a new basketball gym, weight training area, and other facilities.

Vitoria, 1854‚Äì1911) was a Spanish explorer of Africa. A student of philosophy and literature, he fell under the influence of Henry Morton Stanley and turned to exploration. History From 1868-1874 he made preparations for an expedition to Africa. He founded a company to aid collaboration with others who had the same interests. = First Expedition = In 1874 he made his initial preparatory trip to the Gulf of Guinea, from where he planned to proceed towards the interior. During the expedition, Iradier - accompanied by his wife, sister-in- law and others, traveled almost from Aye up to the Muni River. In the course of the journey his wife gave birth to daughter Isabel. He followed the Utamboni river in an attempt to reach the Great Lakes and the mouth of the Muni. The expedition reached the islands of Corisco and Elobey Grande, as well as Inguinna and San Juan, the Utongo and Bathe rivers, as well as the Paluviole and the Saw of Crystal mountain ranges. The expedition had to turn back when the majority of the indigenous escort absconded. Isabel died in the course of the expedition. Iradier mapped the regions he had visited and, on his return to Spain, these were published by the Company of Africanists and Colonistas of Madrid. = Second Expedition = His second expedition began at the end of 1877 during which he recorded vocabularies and grammars of the languages of the tribes he encountered, as well as numerous astronomic, ethnographic, climatological and commercial observations. = Third Expedition = The company funded a third expedition that departed in July 1884. Iradier was accompanied by Dr. Ossorio, who participated as the delegate of the Africanists' Company. The trip crossed the territories he had already explored and reached the navigable limit of the river Utongo, from there following the C√≥ngo river up to the river Muni, down which they descended to coasts of the Buru, on the North-East of Corisco's Bay. Suffering from a high-fever and unable to continue, Iradier returned to Spain, arriving on 28 November 1884. In February 1885 he submitted to the Company of Africanists and Colonists of Madrid various documents, contracts of annexation and notarial deeds, incorporating the territories of the river Muni under Spanish sovereignty. Purportedly such sovereignty had been acknowledged by 101 indigenous leaders, covering an area of 14.000 square kilometres. These territories, known later as Spanish Guinea, remained under Spanish sovereignty until 1968.  Published works  Iradier published numerous works in which he documented his African experiences.

Biography Ouardia Bouchemlal was born (January 9, 1926 at A√Øt Halla, a small village located in the commune of El-Main. Motherless, it is said she was under the tutelage of her uncles when her father remarried. She debuted on stage in Algiers at the age of 16 years, interpreting traditional Kabyle songs. In 1942 Ouardia Bouchemlal, who would choose Cherifa as her artist name, made her debut on Radio Kabyle, as it was still called at that time. She would be one of the pioneers of this medium that would change the habits and attitudes by introducing singing and music at the heart of Kabyle homes. Cherifa was admitted within the female cast of the radio where the master Cheikh Nordine officiates, himself a singer and jack of all trades. At those times, it was still considered that women singing publicly were promiscuous. They were often forbidden by society and disowned by families. Her works were not reported to the Office of Copyrights, she therefore did not receive royalties on her compositions. In the 1970s, she will be even forced to do household chores to meet her needs. Her personal r√©pertoire will be plundered and her songs covered without a penny paid over to her. In the early 1990s, she made a shy comeback and even performs in France.

During the Second French Republic he was made a General and head of the National Guard of Paris. He failed to suppress the invasion of the Constituent Assembly by a mob on 15 May 1848 and was accused of being a traitor, but was later acquitted. Early years Amable-Gaspard- Henri, vicomte de Courtais belonged to a Bourbonnais family that had been settled in Doyet for several generations since the marriage of Gilbert de Courtais with Isabeau de La Souche, heiress of the fief and ch√¢teau of la Souche. The family also owned the ch√¢teau of Chassignole at Doyet. Amable de Courtais was born on 10 January 1790 in Montlu√ßon, Allier. He served in the army under Napoleon and during the Bourbon Restoration. On 5 September 1813 he was granted the Knight's Cross of the Legion of Honor. He retired with the rank of cavalry squadron leader. Courtais had strong democratic views. On 9 July 1842 he was elected to the National Assembly for the fourth college of Allier (Montlucon). His predecessor, Charles Gilbert Tourret, had resigned so he could be elected. The election went to a second round, in which Courtais was elected. He took his seat on the far left. He was reelected on 1 August 1846. He was a signatory in 1848 to the demand for impeachment of the ministry of Fran√ßois Guizot. Second republic The provisional government invited Courtais to assume the rank of General and the command of the National Guard of Paris. On 23 April 1848 he was elected by a decisive majority to represent Allier in the Constituent Assembly. He was both a representative and leader of the National Guard when the Assembly was invaded by the mob on 15 May 1848. General Courtais acted indecisively, and told the guard not to use force against the people. Some managed to enter, but most tried to enter through the rue de Bourgogne, where they found the gate closed and began trying to break it down. Courtais tried to harangue the crowd and persuade them to disperse, but with no effect. The crowd forced through the gate, knocking him down, and great confusion followed. The few guardsmen who were present ran for their arms. Courtais went to Alphonse de Lamartine for advice, but although he was told to place himself at the head of his troops, he continued to wander around without doing anything. He returned to the Assembly at five o'clock, when the room had been emptied of demonstrators. He then told the National Guard to withdraw. He was attacked by some of the representatives, who called him a traitor, seized his sword and stripped off his epaulets. Other representatives intervened, and took him to the library where he was held in custody. L√©on Faucher formally proposed that the general be declared a traitor. Courtais submitted to a year of pre-trial detention before being given his freedom by the High Court of Bourges on 2 April 1849. He returned to the Constituent Assembly, and participated in its final sessions in April and May 1849. He then left politics. In 1871 Courtois was elected to the general council of Allier representing the canton of Montmarault. Courtais died on 10 June 1877 in Doyet, Allier. He was aged 87.

Plot  Andrea Pomeraro is a history teacher from CastroPietro, Sicily. During an outdoor lesson he receives a letter from his uncle, a politician who lives in Rome and who, thanks to his interest, managed to get him a transfer to the capital's high school. Arrived on the spot, he meets his uncle who offers him an apartment, but on one condition: this must also act as an alcove for the faithful encounters of the same honorable, as he is married. In order to avoid inappropriate encounters, the two agree with a system: showing the Italian flag from the balcony means that the house is already occupied. Andrea's first approach with his colleague Delia Benetti and the students is not happy, as he has replaced Professor Verdirame, much loved by the boys. Despite the warnings of Professor Delia, Andrea loses his temper and causes a sort of riot, being reprimanded by the principal. Andrea is fascinated by Delia's beauty, and in a favorable moment he tries an approach, but she rejects him. At the same time, however, the man is also attracted to one of his students, and when Delia realizes it, he unleashes jealousy on the girl: Andrea, realizing the fact, instinctively slaps Delia, without understanding why. Meanwhile, the high school was stormed by students and became the headquarters of the student movement, at the head of which Andrea was elected. His apartment is also not spared and this creates other problems for him with his honorable uncle. Initially, Andrea's intention is only to take advantage of his pupil, but when she indulges in him sexually, she manages to immediately bring him to her side. Delia, however, is in love with Andrea and does not hesitate to make love with one of her students, Aldo, in order to obtain from him a compromising document that could threaten her colleague's teaching position. But when Aldo tries to get his hands on her, she pretends to be thirsty and mistakenly drinks some petrol, fortunately without serious consequences. Meanwhile, Andrea's uncle is put in a plaster cast after an accident; to repair the damage caused by his nephew, he offers Andrea an opportunity to get out of the situation unscathed: to sign a declaration in which he declares that he was forced to organize the riots in the high school under the threat of the students.

The show features former carpenter Adam Carolla, licensed contractor Skip Bedell and his wife Alison, a private investigator. The series premiere was the most watched debut of a Spike original series since March 2011. Background Prior to becoming a star, Adam Carolla gained construction experience working as a carpenter. Skip Bedell is a licensed home improvement contractor and FOX & Friends contributor, Alison Bedell is a full-time probation officer, and licensed private investigator. Format Each episode of Catch a Contractor follows a similar formula. At the beginning of each episode, Adam and Skip meet with the homeowner for that particular episode. They receive a rundown of what was supposed to be done, inspect what was left from the work that was done, and learn about the contractor and how much he was paid to do the work. Once they have all the information they need, they pass information along to Alison, Skip's wife, who is a licensed private investigator. She then goes to work tracking the elusive contractor down. After observing the contractor for a few days, Alison sets up an appointment with the contractor, which is actually a sting operation, where the contractor is lured to a house with the expectation of giving a new job estimate. Alison makes sure the house is rigged with hidden cameras, so that when the contractor arrives, he will not suspect that he is being set up for a confrontation. While the whole camera and production crew are hiding, Alison lures the shoddy contractor into the house and gets (him) in position to be pounced upon by Adam and Skip. In the first season, she would do the luring herself. In the second and third seasons, she has an assistant do the lure due to her becoming more recognizable as a result of her work with the show. Once the contractor is placed into position, Adam and Skip confront the contractor with the camera and sound crew, and questions him about what they know while the homeowner watches on monitors from another room. The contractor is ultimately given three options. The first is to return the money that the homeowner paid him, the second is to go back to the unfinished job and complete the work properly while Adam and Skip supervise. The third is to walk away and do nothing, in which case the homeowners would file a suit in civil court with the assistance of the show. In most cases, the contractor agrees to return to the homeowner's residence and fix the job. Once there, the homeowner can confront him about his shoddy work and the arguments often get heated. The homeowner is then led off the property and put up in a hotel for however long it takes to do the job, which is performed by Skip and his crew, with or without the cooperation from the contractor. Once the job is done, the homeowner returns home to see the finished product, and the episode closes with one final confrontation where the contractor has an opportunity to apologize for his actions, regardless of whether or not he is sincere, or whether or not the homeowner accepts it. Starting with the third season, events behind the scenes are shown, breaking the \\"fourth wall\\", including interactions with the producers and texts describing the full extent of each job. Broadcast The series premiered on March 9, 2014. In April 2014, Spike renewed Catch a Contractor for a second season and expanded the episodes' length to sixty minutes from thirty. In December 2014, Spike ordered a third season of Catch a Contractor, the first episode of which aired on June 21, 2015 and premiered to 748,000 viewers. Internationally, the series premiered in Australia on A&E; on September 22, 2015, and has since been syndicated in Italy, Europe, Great Britain, the Middle East and Canada. On May 1, 2016, Carolla confirmed via his verified Twitter account that Catch a Contractor would not return. Lawsuits In May 2013, Catch a Contractor performed a repair at the home of Rochelle Kirk and Scott Waters of Covina, California, whose bathroom had been torn apart and abandoned by a scheming contractor. Although the repair was completed, they alleged a sewer pipe that was moved during the job was never reconnected, resulting in two hundred gallons of raw sewage spilling into the home undetected. Kirk and Waters filed suit against Viacom and several contractors in February 2014 for $2.87 million, citing the network's refusal to respond to their reports of the situation and a claim that several contractors that helped perform the repair were not licensed. In May 2014, the suit was dismissed due to releases the Plaintiffs had previously signed, and because the Defendants' actions were agreed to be \\"in furtherance of free speech rights\\" and protected under California's \\"anti-SLAPP\\" statute. Plaintiffs were ordered to pay defendants legal fees. Another lawsuit was filed in March 2015, which cites defamation, fraud, false imprisonment, and violation of right to name or likeness.Morran, Chris Contractor Sues Spike TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúCatch A Contractor‚Äù For False Imprisonment, Defamation Consumerist. July 14, 2015 According to the contractor, he began working on remodeling the client's‚Äô house in July 2013. In September of that year, a building inspector flagged a framing issue, requiring an engineering proposal. The contractor alleged the clients moved into the home in spite of the fact that the repair had not been made, and then, in October 2013, stopped payment and ultimately canceled his contract. Instead of receiving a check for a new client, he was instead met with the hosts as well as a \\"bouncer\\" that prevented him from leaving the premises. It goes on to further allege that Adam promised that by signing a release, there would be no further repercussions (along with a $10,000 payout for appearing on the show). However, the plaintiff alleged that bid bond was revised by the homeowners just days later, and alleged he was instead \\"painted in an unfairly negative light\\" and labeled as a \\"criminal\\" by hosts and clients. This case has since been dismissed by the Court with no settlements being awarded.

A $25,000 reward offered for information has gone unclaimed. Background Four dead bodies of women identified as prostitutes were found in a drainage ditch filled with shallow water on November 20, 2006 behind the Golden Key Motel on the Black Horse Pike in Egg Harbor Township, situated on the outskirts of Atlantic City, New Jersey. All of them were placed face down in a row, facing east, about sixty feet apart from each other. They were clothed except for having their shoes and socks removed. They were believed to have been strangled to death. Investigation 41-year-old repairman Terry Oleson, who was being allowed to stay for free at the Golden Key Motel in exchange for repairs when the murders took place, was implicated by his girlfriend as the killer. They were reportedly having a domestic dispute at the time. In Oleson‚Äôs room, investigators found cameras set up and images of his girlfriend's teenage daughter undressing. There have been no DNA matches to connect Oleson with the crimes and he was never named as a suspect. Eldred Raymond Burchell who had given himself the nickname of the \\"River Man\\", being a possible reference to Green River Killer Gary Ridgway, was suspected after he had confessed to another prostitute that he had killed people. However he has not been connected to any murders. There was thought to be a possible connection to the Long Island serial killer but investigators later ruled it out. Charles Coles, a drug dealer and a friend of Kim Raffo, was questioned by police but released without charge, as was Mark Hessee, an acquaintance of Kim Raffo and Barbara Breidor. Victims *Barbara V. Breidor, 42 ‚Äî Worked as a prostitute to support her cocaine addiction. She disappeared in October 2006 but was not reported missing for several weeks. Identified through dental records, her body was so badly decomposed the cause of death could not be determined. *Molly Jean Dilts, 20 ‚Äî Originally from Black Lick, Pennsylvania, she was last seen alive a few days before her disappearance. She was the only victim not to have a record for prostitution, but was believed to be working as one. She was believed to have been the first to be killed and her body was so badly decomposed the cause of death could not be determined. *Kim Raffo, 35 ‚Äî Former waitress, originally from Canarsie, Brooklyn, who left her husband and children for drugs and prostitution in Atlantic City. Last seen alive a day before the bodies were discovered. She was believed to be the last of the four victims to be killed and was strangled with a rope or cord. *Tracy Ann Roberts, 23 ‚Äî Former erotic dancer and originally from a small town in Delaware, who sold sex to support a drug habit. Last seen alive in November 2006 when she was hit in the throat and hospitalized by a man who wished to be her pimp. She had been asphyxiated.

It was incorporated in Illinois in 1922 and became America's top selling brand of cosmetics in the United States. Its success in large part can be attributed to Syma and her brother Alfred Busiel and their innovative marketing through in-store demonstrations, print advertising and sponsorship of national radio programs. In 1949 Syma Cohen sold her half share in the company to her brother Alfred and following his death the company eventually was sold. Subsequently, it had a number of owners. Now a United States company owns the trademark in the United States and a German cosmetic manufacturer owns the business in the rest of the world. History Syma Cohen began the cosmetics manufacturing business with some of her siblings, including her sister Esther, after whom the company was named. Esther left the business early on and Syma registered the trade name ‚ÄúLady Esther‚Äù, in her name in 1913. She sold Lady Esther cream and powder going from home to home and later to drug stores in Chicago and vicinity. In 1922 she caused the company to be incorporated as ‚ÄúLady Esther Company‚Äù and its name was later changed to ‚ÄúLady Esther, Ltd.‚Äù The company undertook an aggressive advertising program in newspapers, magazines and by radio on a nationwide basis. In 1923 it advertised its products at an expense of $143,000.00 with an increase each year, and by 1936 it expended more than 1.5 million dollars. During those years its sales were in excess of thirty six million dollars.Lady Esther, Ltd. v. Lady Esther Corset Shoppe, Inc., 317 Il. App. 451, 46 NE 2d 165 The company's first venture into national radio broadcasting was a sponsorship of the Lady Esther serenade featuring Wayne King and his orchestra. The first broadcast was on September 27, 1931 and Wayne King and Lady Esther parted company in 1939-40. The company continued its national broadcasting sponsorship in 1941 with a live CBS Radio series, ‚ÄúThe Orson Welles Show‚Äù, which was also known as the ‚ÄúLady Esther Show‚Äù. This was followed by a six- season sponsorship of ‚ÄúLady Esther Presents the Screen Guild Players‚Äù. During this time the company steadily grew and the owners prospered. It had built a 20,000 square foot facility at 5710 Armitage Avenue in Chicago and in 1933 leased the 65,000 square foot four story and basement plant of the Tinkertoy Company at 2012 Ridge Avenue, Evanston, Illinois.Chicago Tribune, February 18, 1933 About a year later Syma Cohen purchased a mansion on Sheridan Road in Glencoe, Illinois for $127,000.00. The house was built on 16.89 acres and contained 19 rooms and 7 baths. There were elaborate greenhouses and 3 formal gardens.‚ÄùArnstein & Lehr, The First 120 Years‚Äù, (Louis A. Lehr, Jr.)(Amazon), p. 27 The site is now the location of North Shore Congregation Israel. The popularity of Lady Esther began to wane in the middle 1940s. Other businesses were trying to capitalize on the name and the company became very protective of its trademark. Syma sold her share of the business to Alfred and left the company. She traveled extensively throughout the world and later sold the mansion. Her brother Alfred had died in 1951 and the company had numerous owners. Syma Cohen-Busiel moved into a suite in Chicago's Drake Hotel where she died in 1990 at 99 years of age. The trademark owners in the United States are now a pharmaceutical wholesale company which has no production facilities. A German company Lady Esther Kosmetik GMBH is now the trademark owner elsewhere in the world.

The band's popularity had been boosted by its recording in 1930 of ‚ÄúThe Waltz You Saved for Me‚Äù which became King's theme song. ‚ÄúThe Lady Esther Serenade‚Äù was broadcast at least twice a week in primetime on CBS and/or NBC and Lady Esther became America's top-selling brand of cosmetics. =The Orson Welles Show= September 15, 1941 ‚Äì February 2, 1942‚ÄúThis is Orson Welles‚Äù (Orson Welles and Peter Bogdanovich) Chronology created by Editor Jonathan Rosenbaum The show was also known as the Orson Welles Theater and ‚ÄúLady Esther Presents Orson Welles.‚Äù It was a variety show featuring Orson Welles and his Mercury Theater troupe.

He received his first training from his father, Karl Friedrich Meyerheim (1780-1837), a decorative painter. After further studies with the architect and painter Johann Adam Breysig, he went to Berlin in 1830 and enrolled at the Prussian Academy of Art. His teachers there were Eduard Daege and Johann Gottfried Niedlich. After graduating, he wandered about with his friend, the future Prussian court architect Heinrich Strack, and produced numerous architectural drawings, primarily of churches and older Backsteingotik brick buildings. His first original work, the Sch√ºtzenfest westf√§lischer Bauern (Westphalian Peasants Hunting Party) was painted in 1836 and bought by Joachim Heinrich Wilhelm Wagener, the Swedish-Norwegian Consul, from whose estate it entered the National Gallery (Berlin). Under the influence of the D√ºsseldorf school of painting, he spent the years 1833-1841 producing works in the Romantic genre style. After that, he devoted himself exclusively to portrayals of bourgeois and peasant life, focusing on Westphalia, Thuringia, and Hesse. His work is characterized by enamel-like coloring. By 1855, he was a Regius Professor and a member of the Academies in Berlin, Dresden and Munich. In 1836, he married Karoline Drake, the sister of sculptor Friedrich Drake. In 1870, he was afflicted by a debilitating nervous disorder that periodically prevented him from painting and eventually led to his death.  Other painters in the Meyerheim family  His brother, Wilhelm Alexander Meyerheim (1815‚Äì1882), specialized in genre paintings, pictures of horses and military subjects. Another brother, Hermann Meyerheim (fl.1860s), painted architecture and maritime scenes. His sons, Franz Eduard Meyerheim and Paul Friedrich Meyerheim, were his students.

Description The memorial is made of bronze and has a base made of granite. On the top of a tall shaft is a color bearer from the American Civil War. The color bearer holds a staff with a furled flag in both hands. It is held to his proper left side. The shaft the figure is standing on has two pieces of bunting decorating it, along with eagles, military medals, and a row of mortar shells and round shot. The tower is resting on a battlement style design. Each corner of the battlement design has a musket made of bronze. There are four in total. There is a bronze relief panel on each side of the base.

The annexation from Ukraine followed a Russian military intervention in Crimea that took place in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and was part of wider unrest across southern and eastern Ukraine. On 22‚Äì23 February 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin convened an all-night meeting with security service chiefs to discuss the extrication of the deposed Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych. At the end of the meeting, Putin remarked that \\"we must start working on returning Crimea to Russia\\". On 23 February, pro-Russian demonstrations were held in the Crimean city of Sevastopol. On 27 February, masked Russian troops without insignia took over the Supreme Council (parliament) of Crimea and captured strategic sites across Crimea, which led to the installation of the pro-Russian Aksyonov government in Crimea, the conducting of the Crimean status referendum and the declaration of Crimea's independence on 16 March 2014. Russia formally incorporated Crimea as two federal subjects of the Russian Federation on 18 March 2014. Ukraine and many other countries condemned the annexation and consider it to be a violation of international law and Russian-signed agreements safeguarding the territorial integrity of Ukraine, including the 1991 Belavezha Accords that established the Commonwealth of Independent States, the 1975 Helsinki Accords, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances and the 1997 Treaty on friendship, cooperation and partnership between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. It led to the other members of the then G8 suspending Russia from the group then introducing a first round of sanctions against the country. The United Nations General Assembly also rejected the vote and annexation, adopting a resolution affirming the \\"territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders\\". The UN resolution also \\"underscores that the referendum having no validity, cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of [Crimea]\\" and called upon all states and international organizations not to recognize or to imply the recognition of Russia's annexation. In 2016, the UN General Assembly reaffirmed non- recognition of the annexation and condemned \\"the temporary occupation of part of the territory of Ukraine‚Äîthe Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol\\". The Russian Federation opposes the \\"annexation\\" label, with Putin defending the referendum as complying with the principle of self-determination of peoples.

Retrieved 30 December 2015 During the first stages of the Russian Civil War there were a series of short-lived independent governments (Crimean People's Republic, Crimean Regional Government, Crimean SSR) but they were followed by White Russian governments (General Command of the Armed Forces of South Russia and later South Russian Government). In October 1921, the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of the Russian SFSR was instituted. After the Second World War and the subsequent deportation of all of the indigenous Crimean Tatars, the Crimean ASSR was stripped of its autonomy in 1946 and was downgraded to the status of an oblast of the Russian SFSR. In 1954, the Crimean Oblast was transferred from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. In 1989, under perestroika, the Supreme Soviet declared that the deportation of the Crimean Tatars under Stalin had been illegal, and the mostly Muslim ethnic group was allowed to return to Crimea.\\"The Crimean Tatars began repatriating on a massive scale beginning in the late 1980s and continuing into the early 1990s. The population of Crimean Tatars in Crimea rapidly reached 250,000 and leveled off at 270,000 where it remains as of this writing [2001].

The oblast conducted a referendum in 1991, which asked whether Crimea should be elevated into a signatory of the New Union Treaty (that is, became a union republic on its own). By that time, though, the dissolution of the Soviet Union was well underway. The Crimean ASSR was restored for less than a year as part of Soviet Ukraine before Ukrainian independence.

On 4 February 2014, the Presidium of the Supreme Council considered holding a referendum on the peninsula's status, and asked the Russian government to guarantee the vote.The Chronicles of Alienation; The annexation of Crimea from 2 December 2013, through 4 April 2014, The Ukrainian Week (16 March 2015) The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) responded by opening a criminal case to investigate the possible \\"subversion\\" of Ukraine's territorial integrity. On 20 February 2014, during a visit to Moscow, Chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea Vladimir Konstantinov stated that the 1954 transfer of Crimea from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic had been a mistake. The Euromaidan protests came to a head in late February 2014, and Yanukovych and many of his ministers fled the capital on 22 February. After his flight, opposition parties and defectors from the Party of Regions put together a parliamentary quorum in the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament), and voted on 22 February to remove Yanukovych from his post on the grounds that he was unable to fulfill his duties, although this legislative removal lacked the required three-quarter vote of sitting Rada members according to the constitution in effect at the time, which the Rada also voted to suspend. Arseniy Yatsenyuk was appointed by the Rada to serve as the head of a caretaker government until new presidential and parliament elections could be held. This new government was recognised internationally, though the Russian government said that these events had been a \\"coup d'√©tat\\", and that the caretaker government was illegitimate.  History  = The start of the crisis = \\"Crimean self- defence\\" members, 2 March 2014 Medal of the Russian Defense Ministry \\"For the return of Crimea\\" (), 20 February ‚Äì 18 March 2014 The February 2014 revolution that ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych sparked a political crisis in Crimea, which initially manifested as demonstrations against the new interim Ukrainian government, but rapidly escalated. In January 2014 the Sevastopol city council had already called for formation of \\"people's militia\\" units to \\"ensure firm defence\\" of the city from \\"extremism\\". Crimean parliament members called for an extraordinary meeting on 21 February. In response to pro-Russian separatist sentiment, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said that it would \\"use severe measures to prevent any action taken against diminishing the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine\\". The party with the largest number of seats in the Crimean parliament (80 of 100), the Party of Regions of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, did not discuss Crimean secession, and were supportive of an agreement between President Yanukovych and Euromaidan activists to end the unrest that was struck on the same day in Kyiv. On 22‚Äì23 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin convened an all-night meeting with security services chiefs to discuss extrication of the deposed Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, and at the end of that meeting Putin had remarked that \\"we must start working on returning Crimea to Russia.\\" On 23 February pro-Russian demonstrations were held in the Crimean city of Sevastopol. Crimean prime minister Anatolii Mohyliov said that his government recognised the new provisional government in Kyiv, and that the Crimean autonomous government would carry out all laws passed by the Ukrainian parliament. In Simferopol, a pro-Euromaidan rally of between 5,000‚Äì15,000 was held in support of the new government, and demanding the resignation of the Crimean parliament; attendees waved Ukrainian, Tatar, and European Union flags. Meanwhile, in Sevastopol, thousands protested against the new Ukrainian government, voted to establish a parallel administration, and created civil defence squads with the support of the Russian Night Wolves motorcycle club. Protesters waved Russian flags, chanted \\"Putin is our president!\\", and said they would refuse to further pay taxes to the Ukrainian state. Russian military convoys were also alleged to be seen in the area. In Kerch, pro- Russian protesters attempted to remove the Ukrainian flag from atop city hall and replace it with the flag of Russia. Over 200 attended, waving Russian, orange-and-black St. George, and the Russian Unity party flags. Mayor Oleh Osadchy attempted to disperse the crowd and police eventually arrived to defend the flag. The mayor said \\"This is the territory of Ukraine, Crimea. Here's a flag of Crimea\\", but was accused of treason and a fight ensued over the flagpole. On 24 February, more rallied outside the Sevastopol city state administration. Pro-Russian demonstrators accompanied by neo-Cossacks demanded the election of a Russian citizen as mayor and hoisted Russian flags around the city administration; they also handed out leaflets to sign up for a self- defence militia, warning that the \\"Blue-Brown Europlague is knocking.\\" Volodymyr Yatsuba, head of Sevastopol administration, announced resignation, citing \\"decision of the city's inhabitants\\" made at pro-Russian rally, and while caretaker city administration initially leaned towards recognition of new Ukrainian government, continued pressure from pro-Russian activists forced local authorities to concede. Consequently, Sevastopol City Council illegally elected Alexei Chaly, a Russian citizen, as mayor. Under the law of Ukraine, it was not possible for Sevastopol to elect a mayor, as the Chairman of the Sevastopol City State Administration, appointed by the President of Ukraine, functions as its mayor. A thousand protesters present chanted \\"A Russian mayor for a Russian city.\\" On 25 February, several hundred pro-Russian protesters blocked the Crimean parliament demanding non-recognition of the central government of Ukraine and a referendum on Crimea's status. On the same day, crowds gathered again outside Sevastopol's city hall on Tuesday as rumours spread that security forces could arrest Chaly, but police chief Alexander Goncharov said that his officers would refuse to carry out \\"criminal orders\\" issued by Kyiv. Viktor Neganov, a Sevastopol-based adviser to the Internal Affairs Minister, condemned the events in the city as a coup. \\"Chaly represents the interests of the Kremlin which likely gave its tacit approval,\\" he said. Sevastopol City State Administration chairman Vladimir Yatsuba was booed and heckled on 23 February, when he told a pro-Russian rally that Crimea was part of Ukraine. He resigned the next day. In Simferopol, the Regional State Administration building was blockaded with hundreds of protesters, including neo-Cossacks, demanding a referendum of separation; the rally was organized by the Crimean Front. On 26 February, thousands clashed during opposing rallies in Simferopol. Near the Supreme Council of Crimea building 4,000 and 5,000 Crimean Tatars and supporters of the Euromaidan-Crimea movement faced 600‚Äì700 supporters of pro-Russian organizations and the Russian Unity Party.Crimean Tatars, pro-Russia supporters approach Crimean parliament building, Interfax-Ukraine (26 February 2014) Supreme Council Chairman Vladimir Konstantinov said that the Crimean parliament would not consider separation from Ukraine, and that earlier reports that parliament would hold a debate on the matter were provocations. Tatars created self-defence groups, encouraged collaboration with Russians, Ukrainians, and people of other nationalities, and called for the protection of churches, mosques, synagogues, and other important sites. By nightfall the Crimean Tatars had left; several hundred Russian Unity supporters rallied on.Crimean Tatars leave parliament square; Russian Unity supporters continue rally, Interfax-Ukraine (26 February 2014) The new Ukrainian government's acting Internal Affairs Minister Arsen Avakov tasked Crimean law enforcement agencies not to provoke conflicts and to do whatever necessary to prevent clashes with pro-Russian forces; and he added \\"I think, that way ‚Äì through a dialogue ‚Äì we shall achieve much more than with standoffs\\".Crimean police ordered to prevent clashes at any cost, Interfax- Ukraine (26 February 2014) New Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) chief Valentyn Nalyvaichenko requested that the United Nations provide around-the- clock monitoring of the security situation in Crimea.Ukraine asking UN to monitor security situation in Crimea round the clock, says security service chief, Interfax-Ukraine (26 February 2014) Russian troops took control of the main route to Sevastopol on orders from Russian president Vladimir Putin. A military checkpoint, with a Russian flag and Russian military vehicles, was set up on the main highway between the city and Simferopol. On 27 February, Russian special forces seized the building of the Supreme Council of Crimea and the building of the Council of Ministers in Simferopol. Russian flags were raised over these buildings, and barricades were erected outside them. Whilst the \\"little green men\\" were occupying the Crimean parliament building, the parliament held an emergency session.http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/193292.html Number of Crimean deputies present at referendum resolution vote unclear].

Aksyonov belonged to the Russian Unity party, which received 4% of the vote in the last election. According to the Constitution of Ukraine, the Prime Minister of Crimea is appointed by the Supreme Council of Crimea in consultation with the President of Ukraine.Crimean parliament to decide on appointment of autonomous republic's premier on Tuesday, Interfax Ukraine (7 November 2011). The new prime minister is the leader of Russian Unity, Ukrayinska Pravda (27 February 2014). Both Aksyonov and speaker Vladimir Konstantinov stated that they viewed Viktor Yanukovych as the de jure president of Ukraine, through whom they were able to ask Russia for assistance. The parliament also voted to hold a referendum on greater autonomy set for 25 May. The troops had cut all of the building's communications, and took MPs' phones as they entered. No independent journalists were allowed inside the building while the votes were taking place. Some MPs said they were being threatened and that votes were cast for them and other MPs, even though they were not in the chamber. Interfax-Ukraine reported \\"it is impossible to find out whether all the 64 members of the 100-member legislature who were registered as present at when the two decisions were voted on or whether someone else used the plastic voting cards of some of them\\" because due to the armed occupation of parliament it was unclear how many MPs were present.Number of Crimean deputies present at referendum resolution vote unclear, Interfax- Ukraine (27 February 2014). The head of parliament's information and analysis department, Olha Sulnikova, had phoned from inside the parliamentary building to journalists and had told them 61 of the registered 64 deputies had voted for the referendum resolution and 55 for the resolution to dismiss the government. Donetsk People's Republic separatist Igor Girkin said in January 2015 that Crimean members of parliament were held at gunpoint, and were forced to support the annexation. These actions were immediately declared illegal by the Ukrainian interim government. On the same day, more troops in unmarked uniforms, assisted this time by what appeared to be local Berkut riot police (as well as Russian troops from the 31st Separate Airborne Assault Brigade dressed in Berkut uniforms), established security checkpoints on the Isthmus of Perekop and the Chonhar Peninsula, which separate Crimea from the Ukrainian mainland. Within hours, Ukraine had effectively been cut off from Crimea. On 1 March 2014, Aksyonov declared Crimea's new de facto authorities would exercise control of all Ukrainian military and security installations on the peninsula. He also asked Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been Yanukovych's primary international backer and guarantor, for \\"assistance in ensuring peace and public order\\" in Crimea. Putin promptly received authorisation from the Federation Council of Russia for a Russian military intervention in Ukraine \\"until normalization of a socio-political environment in the country\\". Putin's swift manoeuvre prompted protests of some Russian intelligentsia and demonstrations in Moscow against a Russian military campaign in Crimea. By 2 March, Russian troops moving from the country's naval base in Sevastopol and reinforced by troops, armour, and helicopters from mainland Russia exercised complete control over the Crimean Peninsula. Russian troops operated in Crimea without insignia. On 4 March, Ukrainian General Staff claimed there were units of the 18th Motor Rifle Brigade, 31st Air Assault Brigade and 22nd Spetsnaz Brigade deployed and operating in Crimea, instead of Russian Black Sea Fleet personnel, which violated international agreements signed by Ukraine and Russia. Despite numerous media reports and statements by the Ukrainian and foreign governments describing the unmarked troops as Russian soldiers, government officials concealed the identity of their forces, claiming they were local \\"self-defence\\" units over whom they had no authority. As late as 17 April, Russian foreign minister Lavrov said that there were no spare armed forces in the territory of Crimea. Russian officials eventually admitted to their troops' presence. On 17 April 2014, Putin acknowledged the Russian military backed Crimean separatist militias, stating that Russia's intervention was necessary \\"to ensure proper conditions for the people of Crimea to be able to freely express their will\\". Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu said the country's military actions in Crimea were undertaken by forces of the Black Sea Fleet and were justified by \\"threat to lives of Crimean civilians\\" and danger of \\"takeover of Russian military infrastructure by extremists\\". Ukraine complained that by increasing its troop presence in Crimea, Russia violated the agreement under which it headquartered its Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol and violated the country's sovereignty. The United States and United Kingdom also accused Russia of breaking the terms of the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, by which Russia, the US, and the UK had reaffirmed their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. The Russian government said the Budapest Memorandum did not apply due to \\"complicated internal processes\\" in Crimea. In March 2015, retired Russian Admiral Igor Kasatonov stated that according to his information the Russian troop deployment in Crimea included six helicopter landings and three landings of IL-76 with 500 people. = Legal issues surrounding Crimean annexation = The Russian‚ÄìUkrainian Partition Treaty on the Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet signed in 1997 and prolonged in 2010, determined the status of the military bases and vessels in Crimea prior to the crisis. Russia was allowed to maintain up to 25,000 troops, 24 artillery systems (with a calibre smaller than 100 mm), 132 armoured vehicles, and 22 military planes, on military base in Sevastopol and related infrastructure on the Crimean Peninsula. The Russian Black Sea fleet had basing rights in Crimea until 2042. Usage of navigation stations and troop movements were improperly covered by the treaty and were violated many times as well as related court decisions. February's troop movements were in \\"complete disregard\\" of the treaty. Both Russia and Ukraine are signatories to the Charter of the United Nations. The ratification of said charter has several ramifications in terms of international law, particularly those that cover the subjects of declarations of independence, sovereignty, self-determination, acts of aggression, and humanitarian emergencies. Vladimir Putin said that Russian troops in the Crimean peninsula were aimed \\"to ensure proper conditions for the people of Crimea to be able to freely express their will\\", whilst Ukraine and other nations argue that such intervention is a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. Russia, United States, United Kingdom and Ukraine also signed the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, by which all these countries reaffirmed their obligation to respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine (including Crimea) and to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine. Little green men\\" and lorries after the seizure of Perevalne military base, 9 March 2014 According to the Constitution of Russia, the admission of new federal subjects is governed by federal constitutional law (art. 65.2). Such a law was adopted in 2001, and it postulates that admission of a foreign state or its part into Russia shall be based on a mutual accord between the Russian Federation and the relevant state and shall take place pursuant to an international treaty between the two countries; moreover, it must be initiated by the state in question, not by its subdivision or by Russia. On 28 February 2014, Russian MP Sergey Mironov, along with other members of the Duma, introduced a bill to alter Russia's procedure for adding federal subjects. According to the bill, accession could be initiated by a subdivision of a country, provided that there is \\"absence of efficient sovereign state government in foreign state\\"; the request could be made either by subdivision bodies on their own or on the basis of a referendum held in the subdivision in accordance with corresponding national legislation. On 11 March 2014, both the Supreme Council of Crimea and the Sevastopol City Council adopted a declaration of independence, which stated their intent to declare independence and request full accession to Russia should the pro- Russian option receive the most votes during the scheduled status referendum. The declaration directly referred to the Kosovo independence precedent, by which the Albanian-populated Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija declared independence from Russia's ally Serbia as the Republic of Kosovo in 2008‚Äîa unilateral action Russia staunchly opposed. Many analysts saw the Crimean declaration as an overt effort to pave the way for Crimea's annexation by Russia. Crimean authorities' stated plans to declare independence from Ukraine made the Mironov bill unnecessary. On 20 March 2014, two days after the treaty of accession was signed, the bill was withdrawn by its initiators. At its meeting on 21‚Äì22 March, the Venice Commission stated that the Mironov bill violated \\"in particular, the principles of territorial integrity, national sovereignty, non-intervention in the internal affairs of another state and pacta sunt servanda\\" and was therefore incompatible with international law. = Crimean status referendum = On 27 February 2014, following the takeover of its building by Russian special forces, the Supreme Council of Crimea voted to hold a referendum on 25 May, with the initial question as to whether Crimea should upgrade its autonomy within Ukraine. The referendum date was later moved from 25 May to 30 March. A Ukrainian court declared the referendum to be illegal. On 4 March, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia was not considering annexing Crimea. He said of the peninsula that \\"only citizens themselves, in conditions of free expression of will and their security can determine their future\\". Putin later acknowledged that he had ordered \\"work to bring Crimea back into Russia\\" as early as February. He also acknowledged that in early March there were \\"secret opinion polls\\" held in Crimea, which, according to him, reported overwhelming popular support for Crimea's incorporation into Russia. On 6 March, the Supreme Council moved the referendum date to 16 March and changed its scope to ask a new question: whether Crimea should accede to Russia or restore the 1992 constitution within Ukraine, which the Ukrainian government had previously invalidated. This referendum, unlike one announced earlier, contained no option to maintain the status quo of governance under the 1998 constitution. Ukraine's then-acting President, Oleksander Turchinov, stated that \\"The authorities in Crimea are totally illegitimate, both the parliament and the government. They are forced to work under the barrel of a gun and all their decisions are dictated by fear and are illegal.\\" On 14 March, the Crimean status referendum was deemed unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and a day later, the Verkhovna Rada formally dissolved the Crimean parliament. The referendum was held despite the opposition from the Ukrainian government. Official results reported about 95.5% of participating voters in Crimea (turnout was 83%) were in favour of seceding from Ukraine and joining Russia. The results of referendum were questioned; another report by Evgeny Bobrov, a member of the Russian President's Human Rights Council, suggested the official results were inflated and only 15% to 30% of Crimeans eligible to vote actually voted for the Russian option.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Crimea, quote: ¬´In May 2014 a report from the Russian Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights estimated that the actual turnout for the Crimean independence referendum may have been as low as 30 percent and that, of those voters, between 50 and 60 percent chose union with Russia¬ª The means by which the referendum was conducted were widely criticised by foreign governments and in the Ukrainian and international press, with reports that anyone holding a Russian passport regardless of residency in Crimea was allowed to vote. After the OSCE refused to send observers Russia invited a group of observers from various European far-right political parties aligned with Putin, who stated the referendum was conducted in a free and fair manner. = Breakaway republic = On 17 March, following the official announcement of the referendum results, the Supreme Council of Crimea declared the formal independence of the Republic of Crimea, comprising the territories of both the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, which was granted special status within the breakaway republic. The Crimean parliament declared the \\"partial repeal\\" of Ukrainian laws and began nationalising private and Ukrainian state property located on the Crimean Peninsula, including Ukrainian ports and property of Chornomornaftogaz. Parliament also formally requested that the Russian government admit the breakaway republic into Russia. On same day, the de facto Supreme Council renamed itself the State Council of Crimea, declared the Russian ruble an official currency alongside the hryvnia, and announced that Crimea would switch to Moscow Time (UTC+4) on 30 March. Putin officially recognised the Republic of Crimea 'as a sovereign and independent state' by decree and approved the admission of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol as separate federal subjects of Russia. at http://www.pravo.gov.ru =Accession treaty and finalization of the annexation = President Putin with Vladimir Konstantinov, Sergey Aksyonov and Alexey Chaly at the Kremlin, 18 March 2014 The Treaty on Accession of the Republic of Crimea to Russia was signed between representatives of the Republic of Crimea (including Sevastopol, with which the rest of Crimea briefly unified) and the Russian Federation on 18 March 2014 to lay out terms for the immediate admission of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol as federal subjects of Russia and part of the Russian Federation. (and a PDF copy of signed document)Ukraine crisis: Putin signs Russia-Crimea treaty, BBC, 18 March 2014 It was ratified by the Federal Assembly by 21 March. During a controversial incident in Simferopol on 18 March, some Ukrainian sources said that armed gunmen that were reported to be Russian special forces allegedly stormed the base. This was contested by Russian authorities, who subsequently announced the arrest of an alleged Ukrainian sniper in connection with the killings, but later denied the arrest had occurred. The two casualties had a joint funeral attended by both the Crimean and Ukrainian authorities, and both the Ukrainian soldier and Russian paramilitary \\"self-defence volunteer\\" were mourned together. The incident is now under investigation by both the Crimean authorities and the Ukrainian military.\\"Joint Funeral2\\" 'Opposing sides in Crimean conflict come together today for Simferopol funeral of two men killed, one Ukrainian, the other Russian', Kyiv Post, 22 March 2014\\"Joint Funeral3\\" 'Funeral held for Crimea's first casualties', Agence France-Presse, 22 March 2014 In response to shooting, Ukraine's then acting defense minister Tenyukh authorised Ukrainian troops stationed in Crimea to use deadly force in life-threatening situations. This increased the risk of bloodshed during any takeover of Ukrainian military installations, yet the ensuing Russian operations to seize the remaining Ukrainian military bases and ships in Crimea did not bring new fatalities, although weapons were used and several people were injured. The Russian units involved in such operations were ordered to avoid usage of deadly force when possible. Morale among the Ukrainian troops, which for three weeks were blockaded inside their compounds without any assistance from the Ukrainian government, was very low, and the vast majority of them did not offer any real resistance. On 19 March, President Putin submitted a treaty on Crimea's annexation by Russia and a constitutional amendment to set up two new federal subjects of the Russian Federation to the State Duma. The Russian Constitutional Court found that treaty is in compliance with the Constitution of Russia. The court sat in an emergency session following a formal request by President Vladimir Putin to assess the constitutionality of the treaty. After the Russian Constitutional Court upheld the constitutionality of the treaty, the State Duma ratified it on 20 March. The Duma also approved the draft federal constitutional law admitting Crimea and Sevastopol and establishing them as federal subjects. A Just Russia's Ilya Ponomarev was the only State Duma member to vote against the measures. A day later, the treaty itself and the required amendment to article 65 of the Russian Constitution (which lists the federal subjects of Russia) were ratified by the Federation Council and almost immediately signed into law by Putin.–ü–æ–¥–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω—ã –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω—ã –æ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç–∏–∏ –ö—Ä—ã–º–∞ –∏ –°–µ–≤–∞—Å—Ç–æ–ø–æ–ª—è –≤ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ kremlin.ru Crimea's admission to the Russian Federation was considered retroactive to 18 March, when Putin and Crimean leaders signed the draft treaty.

On 11 April, the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea and City Charter of Sevastopol were adopted, in addition the new federal subjects were enumerated in a newly published revision of the Russian Constitution. On 14 April, Vladimir Putin announced that he would open a ruble-only account with Bank Rossiya and would make it the primary bank in the newly annexed Crimea as well as giving the right to service payments on Russia's $36 billion wholesale electricity market ‚Äì which gave the bank $112 million annually from commission charges alone. In July 2015, Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, declared that Crimea had been fully integrated into Russia. Until 2016 these new subjects were grouped in the Crimean Federal District. On 8 August 2016, Ukraine reported that Russia had increased its military presence along the demarcation line. In response to this military buildup Ukraine also deployed more troops and resources closer to the border with Crimea. The Pentagon has downplayed a Russian invasion of Ukraine, calling Russian troops along the border a regular military exercise. On 10 August, Russia claimed two servicemen were killed in clashes with Ukrainian commandos, and that Ukrainian servicemen had been captured with a total of 40 kg of explosives in their possession. Ukraine denied that the incident took place. Russian accounts claimed that Russian FSB detained \\"Ukrainian saboteurs\\" and \\"terrorists\\" near Armiansk. The ensuing gunfight left one FSB officer and a suspect dead. A number of individuals were detained, including Yevhen Panov, who is described by Russian sources as a Ukrainian military intelligence officer and leader of the sabotage group. The group was allegedly planning terror attacks on important infrastructure in Armiansk, Crimea. Ukrainian media reported that Panov was a military volunteer fighting in the east of the country, however he has more recently been associated with a charitable organization. Russia also claimed that the alleged border infiltration was accompanied by \\"heavy fire\\" from Ukrainian territory, resulting in the death of a Russian soldier. Ukrainian government called the Russian accusations \\"cynical\\" and \\"senseless\\" and argued that since Crimea was Ukrainian territory, it was Russia which \\"has been generously financing and actively supporting terrorism on Ukrainian territory\\". In 2017, a survey performed by the Centre for East European and International Studies showed that 85% of the non-Crimean Tatar respondents believed that if the referendum would be held again it would lead to the same or \\"only marginally different\\" results. Crimea was fully integrated into the Russian media sphere, and links with the rest of Ukraine were hardly existent. On 26 November 2018, lawmakers in the Ukraine Parliament overwhelmingly backed the imposition of martial law along Ukraine's coastal regions and those bordering Russia in response to the firing upon and seizure of Ukrainian naval ships by Russia near the Crimean peninsula a day earlier. A total of 276 lawmakers in Kyiv backed the measure, which took effect on 28 November 2018 and was ended on 26 December. On 28 December 2018, Russia completed a high-tech security fence marking the de facto border between Crimea and Ukraine.  Transition and aftermath  = Economic implications = While initially (right after the annexation), salaries rose, especially those of government workers, this was soon offset by the increase in prices caused by the depreciation of the ruble. Subsequently, after Russian authority became established, wages were cut back again by 30% to 70%. Tourism, previously Crimea's main industry, suffered in particular; it was down by 50% from 2014 in 2015. Crimean agricultural yields were also significantly impacted by the annexation. Ukraine cut off supplies of water through the North Crimean Canal, causing the 2014 rice crop to fail, and greatly damaging the maize and soybean crops. The number of tourists visiting Crimea in the 2014 season was lower than in the previous years due to a combination of Western sanctions, ethical objections by Ukrainians, and the difficulty of getting there for Russians. The Russian government attempted to stimulate the flow of tourists by subsidizing holidays in the peninsula for children and state workers from all Russia which worked mostly for state-owned hotels. In 2015, overall 3 million tourists visited Crimea according to official data, while before annexation it was around 5.5 million on average. The shortage is attributed mostly to stopped flow of tourists from Ukraine. Hotels and restaurants are also experiencing problems with finding enough seasonal workers, who were most arriving from Ukraine in the preceding years. Tourists visiting state-owned hotels are complaining mostly about low standard of rooms and facilities, some of them unrepaired from Soviet times. According to the German newspaper Die Welt, the annexation of Crimea is economically disadvantageous for the Russian Federation. Russia will have to spend billions of euros a year to pay salaries and pensions. Moreover, Russia will have to undertake costly projects to connect Crimea to the Russian water supply and power system because Crimea has no land connection to Russia and at present (2014) gets water, gas and electricity from mainland Ukraine. This requires building a bridge and a pipeline across the Kerch Strait. Also, Novinite claims that a Ukrainian expert told Die Welt that Crimea \\"will not be able to attract tourists\\". The first Deputy to Minister of Finance of Russian Federation Tatyana Nesterenko said in her interview to Forbes Woman that the decision to annex Crimea was made by Russian President Vladimir Putin exclusively, without consulting Russia's Finance Ministry. The Russian business newspaper Kommersant expresses an opinion that Russia will not acquire anything economically from \\"accessing\\" Crimea, which is not very developed industrially, having just a few big factories, and whose yearly gross product is only $4 billion. The newspaper also says that everything from Russia will have to be delivered by sea, higher costs of transportation will result in higher prices for everything, and to avoid a decline in living standards Russia will have to subsidise Crimean people for a few months. In total, Kommersant estimates the costs of integrating Crimea into Russia in $30 billion over the next decade, i.e. $3 billion per year. On the other hand, western oil experts estimate that Russia's seizing of Crimea, and the associated control of an area of Black Sea more than three times its land area gives it access to oil and gas reserves potentially worth trillions of dollars. It also deprives Ukraine of its chances of energy independence. Most immediately however, analysts said, Moscow's acquisition may alter the route along which the South Stream pipeline would be built, saving Russia money, time and engineering challenges. It would also allow Russia to avoid building in Turkish territorial waters, which was necessary in the original route to avoid Ukrainian territory. This pipeline was later canceled in favour of TurkStream, however. Vladimir Putin and his close confidant Arkady Rotenberg before the opening of the Crimean Bridge in May 2018 Russian/Chechen businessman Ruslan Baisarov announced he is ready to invest 12 billion rubles into the construction of a modern sea resort in Crimea, which is expected to create about 1,300 jobs. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Head of Chechnya, said that other Chechen businessmen are planning to invest into Crimea as well. The Russian Federal Service for Communications (Roskomnadzor) warned about a transition period as Russian operators have to change the numbering capacity and subscribers. Country code will be replaced from the Ukrainian +380 to Russian +7. Codes in Crimea start with 65, but in the area of \\"7\\" the 6 is given to Kazakhstan which shares former Soviet Union +7 with Russia, so city codes have to change. The regulator assigned 869 dialling code to Sevastopol and the rest of the peninsula received a 365 code. At the time of the unification with Russia, telephone operators and Internet service providers in Crimea and Sevastopol are connected to the outside world through the territory of Ukraine. Minister of Communications of Russia, Nikolai Nikiforov announced on his Twitter account that postal codes in Crimea will now have six-figures: to the existing five-digit number the number two will be added at the beginning. For example, the Simferopol postal code 95000 will become 295000. Regarding Crimea's borders, the head of Russian Federal Agency for the Development of the State Border Facilities (Rosgranitsa) Konstantin Busygin, who was speaking at a meeting led by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin in Simferopol, the capital of Crimea said the Russian state border in the north of Crimea which, according to his claims, now forms part of the Russian- Ukrainian border, will be fully equipped with the necessary facilities. In the area that now forms the border between Crimea and Ukraine mining the salt lake inlets from the sea that constitute the natural borders, and in the spit of land left over stretches of no-man's-land with wire on either side was created. On early June that year Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed a Government resolution No.961–û –ø—É–Ω–∫—Ç–∞—Ö –ø—Ä–æ–ø—É—Å–∫–∞ —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—É—é –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü—É –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –≤ –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–µ –ö—Ä—ã–º –∏ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–µ –°–µ–≤–∞—Å—Ç–æ–ø–æ–ª–µ dated 5 June 2014 establishing air, sea, road and railway checkpoints. The adopted decisions create a legal basis for the functioning of a checkpoint system at the Russian state border in the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol. In the year following the annexation, armed men seized various Crimean businesses, including banks, hotels, shipyards, farms, gas stations, a bakery, a dairy, and Yalta Film Studio. Russian media have noted this trend as \\"returning to the 90's\\", which is perceived as a period of anarchy and rule of gangs in Russia. In 2015, the Investigative Committee of Russia announced a number of theft and corruption cases in infrastructure projects in Crimea, for example; spending that exceeded the actual accounted costs three times. A number of Russian officials were also arrested for corruption, including head of federal tax inspection. (According to February 2016 official Ukrainian figures) after Russia's annexation 10% of Security Service of Ukraine personnel left Crimea; accompanied by 6,000 of the pre-annexation 20,300 people strong Ukrainian army. After the annexation of Crimea left only 10% of staff SBU, Ukrayinska Pravda (8 February 2016) As result of the Crimea unsettled status Russian mobile operators never expanded their operations on its territory and all mobile services are offered on the basis of \\"internal roaming\\", which caused significant controversy inside Russia. Telecoms however argued that expanding coverage to Crimea will put them at risk of Western sanctions and, as result, they will lose access to key equipment and software, none of which is produced locally. = Human rights situation = In March 2014, Human Rights Watch reported that pro-Ukrainian activists and journalists had been attacked, abducted, and tortured by self-defense groups. Some Crimeans were simply \\"disappeared\\" with no explanation. On 9 May 2014, the new \\"anti-extremist\\" amendment to the Criminal Code of Russia, passed in December 2013, came into force. Article 280.1 designated incitement of violation of territorial integrity of the Russian Federation–§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω –æ—Ç 28 December 2013 N 433-–§–ó \\"–û –≤–Ω–µ—Å–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤ –£–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–¥–µ–∫—Å –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏\\" (incl. calls for secession of Crimea from Russia) as a criminal offense in Russia, punishable by a fine of 300 thousand roubles or imprisonment up to 3 years. If such statements are made in public media or the internet, the punishment could be obligatory works up to 480 hours or imprisonment up to five years. Following the annexation of Crimea, according to report released on the Russian government run President of Russia's Council on Civil Society and Human Rights website, Tatars who were opposed to Russian rule have been persecuted, Russian law restricting freedom of speech has been imposed, and the new pro-Russian authorities \\"liquidated\\" the Kyiv Patriarchate Orthodox church on the peninsula. The Crimean Tatar television station was also shut down by the Russian authorities. Russian President Putin meeting with representatives of the Crimean Tatars, 16 May 2014 After the annexation, on 16 May the new Russian authorities of Crimea issued a ban on the annual commemorations of the anniversary of the Deportation of the Crimean Tatars by Stalin in 1944, citing \\"possibility of provocation by extremists\\" as a reason. Previously, when Crimea was controlled by Ukraine, these commemorations had taken place every year. The pro-Russian Crimean authorities also banned Mustafa Dzhemilev, a human rights activist, Soviet dissident, member of the Ukrainian parliament, and former Chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatars from entering Crimea. Additionally, Mejlis reported, that officers of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) raided Tatar homes in the same week, on the pretense of \\"suspicion of terrorist activity\\". The Tatar community eventually did hold commemorative rallies in defiance of the ban. In response Russian authorities flew helicopters over the rallies in an attempt to disrupt them. In May 2015, a local activist, Alexander Kostenko, was sentenced to four years in a penal colony. His lawyer, Dmitry Sotnikov, said that the case was fabricated and that his client had been beaten and starved. Crimean prosecutor Natalia Poklonskaya announced that they were judging \\"not just [Kostenko], but the very idea of fascism and nazism, which are trying to raise their head once again.\\" Sotnikov responded that \\"There are fabricated cases in Russia, but rarely such humiliation and physical harm. A living person is being tortured for a political idea, to be able to boast winning over fascism.\\" In June 2015, Razom released a report compiling human rights abuses in Crimea. In its 2016 annual report, the Council of Europe made no mention of human rights abuses in Crimea because Russia had not allowed its monitors to enter. In February 2016 human rights defender Emir-Usein Kuku from Crimea was arrested and accused of belonging to the Islamist organization Hizb ut-Tahrir although he denies any involvement in this organization. Amnesty International has called for his immediate release. In December 2016, the United Nations General Assembly voted on a resolution on human rights in occupied Crimea. It called on the Russian Federation \\"to take all measures necessary to bring an immediate end to all abuses against residents of Crimea, in particular reported discriminatory measures and practices, arbitrary detentions, torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, and to revoke all discriminatory legislation.\\" It also urged Russia to \\"immediately release Ukrainian citizens who were unlawfully detained and judged without regard for elementary standards of justice.\\" According to the United Nations and multiple NGOs, the Russian Federation is responsible for multiple human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary detention, forced disappearances and instances of discrimination, including persecution of Crimean Tatars in Crimea since the illegal annexation. On 24 May 2014 Ervin Ibragimov, a former member of the Bakhchysarai Town Council and a member of the World Congress of Crimean Tatars went missing. CCTV footage from a camera at a nearby shop documents that Ibragimov had been stopped by a group of men and that he is briefly speaking to the men before being forced in their van. According to the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group Russian authorities refuse to investigate the disappearance of Ibragimov. In May 2018 Server Mustafayev, the founder and coordinator of the human rights movement Crimean Solidarity was imprisoned by Russian authorities and charged with \\"membership of a terrorist organisation\\". Amnesty International and Front Line Defenders demand his immediate release. On 12 June 2018, Ukraine lodged a memorandum weighing about 90 kg, consisting of 17,500 pages of text in 29 volumes to the UN's International Court of Justice about racial discrimination by Russian authorities in occupied Crimea and state financing of terrorism by Russian Federation in Donbass. Between 2015 and 2019 over 134,000 (less than 5% to 2014 consensus) people living in Crimea applied for and were issued Ukrainian passports. = Crimean public opinion = Concert to mark the fifth anniversary of annexation in Simferopol, Crimea, 18 March 2019 A joint survey by American government agency Broadcasting Board of Governors and polling firm Gallup was taken during April 2014. It polled 500 residents of Crimea. The survey found that 82.8% of those polled believed that the results of the Crimean status referendum reflected the views of most residents of Crimea, whereas 6.7% said that it did not. 73.9% of those polled said that they thought that the annexation would have a positive impact on their lives, whereas 5.5% said that it would not. 13.6% said that they did not know. A comprehensive poll released on 8 May 2014 by the Pew Research Centre surveyed local opinions on the annexation. Despite international criticism of 16 March referendum on Crimean status, 91% of those Crimeans polled thought that the vote was free and fair, and 88% said that the Ukrainian government should recognise the results. In a survey completed in 2019 by a Russian company FOM 72% of surveyed Crimean residents said their lives have improved since annexation. At the same time only 39% Russians living in the mainland said the annexation was beneficial for the country as a whole which marks a significant drop from 67% in 2015.  Ukrainian response  Immediately after the treaty of accession was signed in March, the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Provisional Principal of Russia in Ukraine to present note verbale of protest against Russia's recognition of the Republic of Crimea and its subsequent annexation. Two days later, the Verkhovna Rada condemned the treaty and called Russia's actions \\"a gross violation of international law\\". The Rada called on the international community to avoid recognition of the \\"so-called Republic of Crimea\\" or the annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol by Russia as new federal subjects. On 15 April 2014, the Verkhovna Rada declared the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol to be under \\"provisional occupation\\" by the Russian military and imposed travel restrictions on Ukrainians visiting Crimea. The territories were also deemed \\"inalienable parts of Ukraine\\" subject to Ukrainian law. Among other things, the special law approved by the Rada restricted foreign citizens' movements to and from the Crimean Peninsula and forbade certain types of entrepreneurship. The law also forbade activity of government bodies formed in violation of Ukrainian law and designated their acts as null and void. The law had little to no actual effect in Crimea itself due to the mutual non-recognition between Kyiv and Simferopol. Ukrainian authorities greatly reduced the volume of water flowing into Crimea via the North Crimean Canal due to huge debt for water supplied in previous year, threatening the viability of the peninsula's agricultural crops, which are heavily dependent on irrigation. The Ukrainian National Council for TV and Radio Broadcasting has instructed all cable operators on 11 March to stop transmitting a number of Russian channels, including the international versions of the main state- controlled stations, Rossiya-1, Channel One and NTV, as well as news channel Rossiya-cable operators on. They said that this is because of Russian media showing them in a negative light. In March 2014, activists began organising flash mobs in supermarkets to urge customers not to buy Russian goods and to boycott Russian gas stations, banks, and concerts. In April 2014, some cinemas in Kyiv, Lviv, and Odessa began shunning Russian films.–ù–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –∫–∏–Ω–æ—Ç–µ–∞—Ç—Ä—ã –ö–∏–µ–≤–∞, –õ—å–≤–æ–≤–∞ –∏ –û–¥–µ—Å—Å—ã –æ–±—ä—è–≤–∏–ª–∏ –±–æ–π–∫–æ—Ç —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –∫–∏–Ω–æ–ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ü–∏–∏ . –¶–µ–Ω–∑–æ—Ä–ù–ï–¢. 11 April 2014 On 2 December 2014, the Ministry of Information Policy was created with one of its goals being, according to first Minister of Information, Yuriy Stets, to counteract \\"Russian information aggression\\". In December 2014, Ukraine halted all train and bus services to Crimea. On 16 September 2015 the Ukrainian parliament voted for the law that sets 20 February 2014 as the official date of the Russian temporary occupation of Crimean peninsula.Rada names 20 February 2014 as official date of Crimea, Sevastopol occupation by Russia.

We will be examining the situation and doing so fast.\\" They also stated that in the event of a referendum for the Crimea region joining the Russian Federation, they would consider its results \\"very fast\\". Later Slutsky announced that he was misunderstood by the Crimean press, and no decision regarding simplifying the process of acquiring Russian citizenship for people in Crimea had been made yet. He also added that if \\"fellow Russian citizens are in jeopardy, you understand that we do not stay away\\". On 25 February, in a meeting with Crimean politicians, he stated that Viktor Yanukovych was still the legitimate president of Ukraine. That same day, the Russian Duma announced it was determining measures so that Russians in Ukraine who \\"did not want to break from the Russian World\\" could acquire Russian citizenship. On 26 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian Armed Forces to be \\"put on alert in the Western Military District as well as units stationed with the 2nd Army Central Military District Command involved in aerospace defence, airborne troops and long-range military transport.\\" Despite media speculation that this was in reaction to the events in Ukraine, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said it was for reasons separate from the unrest in Ukraine. On 27 February 2014, the Russian government dismissed accusations that it was in violation of the basic agreements regarding the Black Sea Fleet: \\"All movements of armored vehicles are undertaken in full compliance with the basic agreements and did not require any approvals\\". On 27 February, the Russian governing agencies presented the new law project on granting citizenship. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on the West and particularly NATO to \\"abandon the provocative statements and respect the neutral status of Ukraine\\". In its statement, the ministry claims that the agreement on settlement of the crisis, which was signed on 21 February and was witnessed by foreign ministries from Germany, Poland and France had to this date, not been implemented (Vladimir Lukin from Russia had not signed it). On 28 February, according to ITAR-TASS, the Russian Ministry of Transport discontinued further talks with Ukraine in regards to the Kerch Strait Bridge project. However, on 3 March Dmitry Medvedev, the Prime Minister of Russia, signed a decree creating a subsidiary of Russian Highways (Avtodor) to build a bridge at an unspecified location along the Kerch strait.The Moscow Times. 4 March 2014 March of Peace, which took place in Moscow a day before the Crimean referendum. On Russian social networks, there was a movement to gather volunteers who served in the Russian army to go to Ukraine. On 28 February, President Putin stated in telephone calls with key EU leaders that it was of \\"extreme importance of not allowing a further escalation of violence and the necessity of a rapid normalisation of the situation in Ukraine\\". Already on 19 February the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had referred to the Euromaidan revolution as the \\"Brown revolution\\". The Federation Council approved that Russia may introduce a limited contingent of Russian troops in Crimea for the security of the Black Sea Fleet and the Russians.Council of the Federation: Russia may introduce troops into Crimea. Ukrainska Pravda. 1 March 2014. In Moscow, on 2 March, an estimated 27,000 rallied in support of the Russian government's decision to intervene in Ukraine. The rallies received considerable attention on Russian state TV and were officially approved by the government. Meanwhile, on 1 March, five people who were picketing next to the Federation Council building against the invasion of Ukraine were arrested. The next day about 200 people protested at the building of the Russian Ministry of Defence in Moscow against Russian military involvement. About 500 people also gathered to protest on the Manezhnaya Square in Moscow, and the same number of people on the Saint Isaac's Square in Saint Petersburg. On 2 March, about eleven protesters demonstrated in Yekaterinburg against Russian involvement, with some wrapped in the Ukrainian flag. Protests were also held in Chelyabinsk on the same day. Opposition to the military intervention was also expressed by rock musician Andrey Makarevich, who wrote in particular: \\"You want war with Ukraine? It will not be the way it was with Abkhazia: the folks on the Maidan have been hardened and know what they are fighting for ‚Äì for their country, their independence. ... We have to live with them. Still neighborly. And preferably in friendship. But it's up to them how they want to live\\". The Professor of the Department of Philosophy at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations Andrey Zubov was fired for his article in Vedomosti, criticising Russian military intervention. On 2 March, one Moscow resident protested against Russian intervention by holding a \\"Stop the war\\" banner, but he was immediately harassed by passers-by, and when the police were arresting him, a woman offered them a serious, fabricated charge against him, of beating up a child; however, her charge was rejected by the police. Andrei Zubov, a professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, who compared Russian actions in Crimea to the Anschluss of Austria, was threatened. Akexander Chuyev, the leader of the pro-Kremlin Spravedlivaya Rossiya party, also objected to Russian intervention in Ukraine. Boris Akunin, popular Russian writer, predicted that Russia's moves would lead to political and economic isolation. Russian President Vladimir Putin (seated, middle) speaks to the press on 4 March 2014, denouncing the events in Kyiv as an \\"unconstitutional coup\\", and insisting that Moscow has a right to protect Russians in Ukraine. President Putin's approval rating among the Russian public increased by nearly 10% since the crisis began, up to 71.6%, the highest in three years, according to a poll conducted by the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion Research, released on 19 March. Additionally, the same poll showed that more than 90% of Russians supported unification with the Crimean Republic. On 4 March, at a press conference in Novo-Ogaryovo, President Putin expressed his view on the situation that if a revolution took place in Ukraine, it would be a new country with which Russia had not concluded any treaties. He offered an analogy with the events of 1917 in Russia, when as a result of the revolution the Russian Empire fell apart and a new state was created. However, he stated Ukraine would still have to honour its debts. Around 100,000 people gathered in Crimean Sevastopol at Victory Day parade Russian politicians speculated that there were already 143,000 Ukrainian refugees in Russia. The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs refuted those claims of refugee increases in Russia. At a briefing on 4 March 2014, the director of the department of information policy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Yevhen Perebiynis said that Russia was misinforming its own citizens as well as the entire international community to justify its own actions in the Crimea. On 5 March, an anchor of the Russian-owned international news channel RT America, Abby Martin, in an interview with Piers Morgan, said she \\"did not agree\\" with how her employer RT was covering the Ukrainian crisis, but claimed RT still supported her despite her differences of opinion. Also on 5 March 2014, another RT America anchor, Liz Wahl, of the network's Washington, DC bureau, resigned on air, explaining that she could not be \\"part of a network that whitewashes the actions of Putin\\" and citing her Hungarian ancestry and the memory of the Soviet repression of the Hungarian Uprising as a factor in her decision. In early March, Igor Andreyev, a 75-year-old survivor of the Siege of Leningrad, attended an anti-war rally against the Russian intervention in Crimea and was holding a sign that read \\"Peace to the World\\". The riot police arrested him, and a local pro-government lawyer then accused him of being a supporter of \\"fascism\\". The retiree, who lived on a 6,500-ruble monthly pension, was fined 10,000 rubles. Prominent dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky said that Crimea should stay within Ukraine with broader autonomy. Tatarstan, a republic within Russia populated by Volga Tatars, has sought to alleviate concerns about treatment of Tatars by Russia, as Tatarstan is a gas-rich and economically successful republic in Russia. On 5 March, President of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov signed an agreement on co- operation between Tatarstan and the Aksyonov government in Crimea that implied collaboration between ten government institutions as well as significant financial aid to Crimea from Tatarstan businesses. On 11 March, Minnikhanov was in Crimea on his second visit and attended as a guest in the Crimean parliament chamber during the vote on the declaration of sovereignty pending 16 March referendum. The Tatarstan's Mufti Kamil Samigullin invited Crimean Tatars to study in madrasas in Kazan, and declared support for their \\"brothers in faith and blood\\". Mustafa Dzhemilev, a former leader of the Crimean Tatar Majlis, believed that forces that were suspected to be Russian forces should leave the Crimean peninsula, and asked the UN Security Council to send peacekeepers into the region. On 13 March, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a comparison between Crimea and Kosovo in a phone call with US President Barack Obama. Hotel in Kerch, Crimea, 2015 On 15 March, thousands of protesters (estimates varying from 3,000 by official sources up to 50,000 claimed by opposition) in Moscow marched against Russian involvement in Ukraine, many waving Ukrainian flags. At the same time, a pro-government (and pro-referendum) rally occurred across the street, counting in the thousands as well (officials claiming 27,000 with opposition claiming about 10,000). In February 2015, the leading independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported that it obtained documents, allegedly written by oligarch Konstantin Malofayev and others, which provided the Russian government with a strategy in the event of Viktor Yanukovych's removal from power and the break-up of Ukraine, which were considered likely. The documents outline plans for annexation of Crimea and the eastern portions of the country, closely describing the events that actually followed after Yanukovych's fall. The documents also describe plans for a public relations campaign which would seek to justify Russian actions. In June 2015 Mikhail Kasyanov stated that all Russian Duma decisions on Crimea annexation were illegal from the international point of view and the annexation was provoked by false accusations of discrimination of Russian nationals in Ukraine.  Response within Crimea  The widespread international condemnation of the annexation of Crimea by Russia in March 2014 was at odds with the strong local support for the transfer of territory in the peninsula.  International response  thumb300pxrightInternational reaction to the 2014 Crimean crisis according to official governmental statements. \\\\---- There have been a range of international reactions to the annexation. The UN General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution 100 in favour, 11 against and 58 abstentions in the 193-nation assembly that declared invalid Crimea's Moscow-backed referendum. In a move supported by the Lithuanian President, the United States government imposed sanctions against persons they deem to have violated or assisted in the violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. The European Union suspended talks with Russia on economic and visa-related matters, and is considering more stringent sanctions against Russia in the near future, including asset freezes. while Japan announced sanctions which include suspension of talks relating to military, space, investment, and visa requirements. The United Kingdom qualified the referendum vote in Crimea of being \\"farcical\\", \\"illegal\\" and \\"illegitimate\\". The European Commission decided on 11 March to enter into a full free-trade agreement with Ukraine within the year. On 12 March, the European Parliament rejected the upcoming referendum on independence in Crimea, which they saw as manipulated and contrary to international and Ukrainian law. The G7 bloc of developed nations (the G8 minus Russia) made a joint statement condemning Russia and announced that they would suspend preparations for the planned G8 summit in Sochi in June. NATO condemned Russia's military escalation in Crimea and stated that it was a breach of international law while the Council of Europe expressed its full support for the territorial integrity and national unity of Ukraine. The Visegr√°d Group has issued a joint statement urging Russia to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and for Ukraine to take into account its minority groups to not further break fragile relations. It has urged for Russia to respect Ukrainian and international law and in line with the provisions of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. China said \\"We respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine\\". A spokesman restated China's belief of non- interference in the internal affairs of other nations and urged dialogue. National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon of India stated that Russia has legitimate interests in Crimea and called for \\"sustained diplomatic efforts\\" and \\"constructive dialogue\\" to resolve the crisis. However, the National Security Advisor is not a part of the Cabinet of India and, as such, Menon's statement was not an official statement issued by the government of India.\\"However, when questioned, national security adviser Shivshankar Menon said...\\" (source) However, India subsequently made it clear that it will not support any \\"unilateral measures\\" against the Russian government. \\"India has never supported unilateral sanctions against any country. Therefore, we will also not support any unilateral measures by a country or a group of countries against Russia.\\" Both Syria and Venezuela openly support Russian military action. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said that he supports Putin's efforts to \\"restore security and stability in the friendly country of Ukraine\\", while Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro condemned Ukraine's \\"ultra-nationalist\\" coup. Sri Lanka described Yanukovych's removal as unconstitutional and considered Russia's concerns in Crimea as justified. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called for change in EU energy policy as Germany's dependence on Russian gas poses risks for Europe. On 13 March, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned the Russian government it risks massive damage to Russia, economically and politically, if it refuses to change course on Ukraine, though close economic links between Germany and Russia significantly reduce the scope for any sanctions. After Russia moved to formally incorporate Crimea, some worried whether it may do the same in other regions. US deputy national security advisor Tony Blinken said that the Russian troops massed on the eastern Ukrainian border may be preparing to enter the country's eastern regions. Russian officials stated that Russian troops would not enter other areas. US Air Force Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, warned that the same troops were in a position to take over the separatist Russian-speaking Moldovan province of Transnistria. On 9 April, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe deprived Russia of voting rights. On 14 August, while visiting Crimea, Vladimir Putin ruled out pushing beyond Crimea. He undertook to do everything he could to end the conflict in Ukraine, saying Russia needed to build calmly and with dignity, not by confrontation and war which isolated it from the rest of the world. = United Nations resolutions =  Security Council resolution  On 15 March 2014, a US-sponsored resolution that went to a vote in the UN Security Council to reaffirm that council's commitment to Ukraine's \\"sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity\\" was not approved. Though a total of 13 council members voted in favour of the resolution and China abstained, Russia vetoed the resolution.  General Assembly resolution  On 27 March 2014, the UN General Assembly approved a resolution describing the referendum leading to annexation of Crimea by Russia as illegal. The draft resolution, which was titled \\"Territorial integrity of Ukraine\\", was co-sponsored by Canada, Costa Rica, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and the US. It affirmed the council's commitment to the \\"sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.\\" The resolution tried to underscore that 16 March referendum held in Crimea and the city of Sevastopol has no validity and cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol. The resolution got 100 votes in its favour, while 11 nations voted against and 58 countries abstained from the vote. The resolution was non-binding and the vote was largely symbolic. = International recognition = The vast majority of the international community has not recognised the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol as part of Russia. Most nations in North America, Central America, Europe, Oceania, and Africa, as well as Asia outside of the former Soviet republics, have openly rejected the referendum and the accession, and instead consider Crimea and Sevastopol to be administrative divisions of Ukraine. The remainder have largely remained neutral. The 27 March 2014 vote on United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262 (supporting the position that Crimea and Sevastopol remain part of Ukraine) was 100 to 11 in favour, with 58 states abstaining and a further 24 of the 193 member states not voting through being absent when the vote took place. Afghanistan, Cuba, the North Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Nicaragua, Sudan, Syria, and Zimbabwe have recognised the result of the 2014 referendum in Crimea. The position of Belarus is vague: it includes statements made by Alexander Lukashenko that, on the one hand, \\"Ukraine should remain an integral, indivisible, non-aligned state\\", and \\"As for Crimea, I do not like it when the integrity and independence of a country are broken\\"; and on the other hand, \\"Today Crimea is part of the Russian Federation. No matter whether you recognize it or not, the fact remains\\", and \\"Whether Crimea will be recognised as a region of the Russian Federation de-jure does not really matter.\\"President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko answers questions of mass media representatives on 23 March 2014. president.gov.by. 23 March 2014. Three non-UN member states recognised the results of the referendum: Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Artsakh. A fourth, Transnistria, sent a request on 18 March 2014 to join the Russian Federation following the Crimean example and in compliance with the Admission Law provisions. On 16 April 2014, Transnistria urged Russia and the United Nations to recognise its independence. Putin is aware of Transnistria's recognition request, according to Dmitry Peskov. The regional councils of Italy's northern regions Lombardy and Veneto have adopted a non-binding resolution on recognizing Crimea as part of Russia; to be noted, Italian regions have no competence of international recognition. = Sanctions = Sanctions were imposed to prevent Russian and Crimean officials and politicians from travelling to Canada, the United States, and the European Union. They were the most wide-ranging applied to Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Japan announced milder sanctions than the US and EU. These include suspension of talks relating to military, space, investment, and visa requirements. In response to the sanctions introduced by the US and EU, the Russian Duma unanimously passed a resolution asking for all members of the Duma to be included on the sanctions list. Head of the opposition A Just Russia party Sergei Mironov said he was proud of being included on the sanctions list: \\"It is with pride that I have found myself on the black list, this means they have noticed my stance on Crimea.\\" Russian companies started pulling billions of dollars out of Western banks to avoid any asset freeze. Three days after the lists were published, the Russian Foreign Ministry published a reciprocal sanctions list of US citizens, which consisted of 10 names, including House Speaker John Boehner, Senator John McCain, and two advisers to President Obama. The ministry said in a statement: \\"Treating our country in such way, as Washington could have already ascertained, is inappropriate and counterproductive,\\" and reiterated that sanctions against Russia would have a boomerang effect. Several of those sanctioned responded with pride at their inclusion on the list, including John Boehner, John McCain, Bob Menendez, Dan Coats, Mary Landrieu, and Harry Reid. On 24 March, Russia imposed retaliatory sanctions on 13 Canadian officials including members of the Parliament of Canada, banning them from entering Russia. Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird, said the sanctions were \\"a badge of honour.\\" Former Minister of Justice Irwin Cotler also said that he considered the sanctions a badge of honour, not a mark of exclusion. In March 2014, The Christian Science Monitor reported, \\"The good news is that so far, Russia has shown no inclination to use the NDN as leverage in the wake of US retaliation for its troop movements in Crimea.\\" Expanded Western sanctions in mid-March coursed through financial markets, hitting the business interests of some of Russia's richest people. The Americans centred on the heart of Moscow's leadership, though the EU's initial list shied from targeting Putin's inner circle. As ratings agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor's downgraded Russia's credit outlook, Russian banks warned of a sanctions-induced recession, the country braced for capital outflows for the first three months of 2014 to reach $70 billion, more than the entirety of outflows for 2013, and Russian government-bond issues plummeted by three-quarters compared with the same period the previous year. Novatek, Russia's second-largest gas producer, saw $2.5bn in market value wiped out when its shares sank by nearly 10%, rendering Putin's close friend Gennady Timchenko, who has a 23% stake in the company, $575m poorer. \\"I do hope that there is some serious diplomatic activity going on behind the scenes,\\" said one Russian banker, though others were more sanguine on the question of whether the sanctions would have any enduring effect, and Russians, top and bottom, seemed defiant. The official Russian response was mixed. Minister of Economic Development of the Russian Federation Alexey Ulyukaev said that introduction of sectoral sanctions will lead to a serious decline of the Russian economy: economic growth of Russia will become seriously negative, the growth of volumes of investment will be even more negative, inflation will rise, and government revenues and reserves will go down. As well as differences between the United States and Europe as a whole as to how to respond to the Russian-backed incursion, those same differences have played out among Eastern European countries. A number of Russian citizens reported that they have been denied European visas after they visited Crimea after annexation. A Russian consumer protection watchdog OZPP published a warning for Russian tourists about this risk, explaining that from the international law point of view, Crimea is an occupied territory, after which Roskomnadzor blocked the OZPP website \\"for threatening territorial integrity of Russian Federation\\". In response to having its voting rights revoked, Russia in June 2017 suspended its budget payments to the Council of Europe, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stating payments would not resume until all rights of Russia's delegation were fully restored. Council Secretary General Thorbj√∏rn Jagland has suggested lifting the sanctions to avoid the impact of mounting budgetary restraints. However, Council members such as Ukraine and its supporters have argued that readmitting Russia without demanding concessions in return would amount to \\"caving to Russian 'blackmail'\\". = Mapping = * , the United Nations still maps Crimea as belonging to Ukraine. * National Geographic Society stated that their policy is \\"to portray current reality\\" and \\"Crimea, if it is formally annexed by Russia, would be shaded gray\\", but also further remarked that this step does not suggest recognising legitimacy of such. As of April 2014 Crimea was still displayed as part of Ukraine. * , Google Maps displays Crimea as a disputed territory to most viewers. For the Russian and Ukrainian versions of website, Crimea is marked as belonging to corresponding country (Russia or Ukraine respectively). Google stated that it \\"work(s) with sources to get the best interpretation of the border or claim lines\\". * , Yandex displays Crimea as Russian, except for users entering from their Ukrainian site and their Turkish site. Users visiting Yandex.ru from Russia will see Crimea displayed as Russian territory, users visiting yandex.ua from Ukraine will see Crimea as Ukrainian and all other users (from other countries) will see Crimea as Russian territory. According to official statement, the company works with users from different countries and \\"displays reality that surrounds them\\". * , Bing Maps, OpenStreetMap and HERE display Crimea as belonging to Ukraine. In particular, Open Street Map requested its users to refrain from editing borders and administrative relations of subdivisions located in Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol until 31 May 2014. On 5 June 2014 OpenStreetMap switched to a territorial dispute option, displaying Crimea as a disputed territory belonging to both countries. * In 2015, on the PepsiCo website a Russian-language map was visible for a few days that depicted Crimea as a part of Russia. * The 2016 edition of a French atlas published by Larousse shows Crimea as part of Russian territory: Oleh Shamshur, Ukrainian Ambassador to France, expressed shock. Shortly after, Larousse corrected the mistake on the Atlas on their internet version, and confirmed that Crimea is a region of Ukraine. * The Italian-language magazine of geopolitics Limes maps Crimea as a part of Russia since December 2015.L‚Äôattivismo militare della Russia nel 2015, Limes After protests by the Ukrainian embassy in Italy, the magazine editor Lucio Caracciolo wrote that \\"the map reflects reality.

Sidra is under control of an eastern Libyan militia group that under the leadership of Ibrahim Jathran defies the central government and aims for greater autonomy. At Sidra the tanker was loaded with 234,000 barrels of state-owned crude oil that had been seized by the rebels.

When Mpande was chieftain of the Nyandwini clan, Nongalaza commanded his forces against the invasion by Robert Biggar and rebel Zulus, successfully destroying them at the Tugela River in 1838.Labland, John, Historical Dictionary of the Zulu Wars, Scarecrow Press, 2009, p.201 In 1840, Mpande allied with the Boers and moved against his brother Dingane in a bid for the Zulu throne. Nongalaza led Mpande's main army, while Mpande took a separate route towards Dingane with a force of Boers under Andries Pretorius. Nongalaza encountered Dingane's army before the Boers arrived, and decided to attack immediately. At the Battle of Maqongqo Nongalaza crushed Dingane, and when Mpande arrived he was installed as king. Under Mpande's rule, Nongalaza continued to enjoy the king's support, and was enriched with land and cattle. The trader and hunter William Clayton Humphreys reported that Nongalaza was \\"exceedingly kind\\" to him during his trip into Zululand in 1851.Pridmore, J., \\"Hunter, Trader and Explorer: the Unvarnished Reminiscences of H.F. Flynn\\", Alternation, 1996, 46-56. In 1856, a civil war broke out between Cetshwayo and Mbuyazi, the king's two oldest sons. Cetshwayo was supported by most of the territorial sub-chiefs, but Mpande favoured his younger son Mbuyazi. Nongalaza joined Mbuyazi. At the Battle of Ndondakusuka Mbuyazi was defeated, and Cetshwayo massacred almost all his followers, including five of his brothers.Gump, James, The Dust Rose like Smoke: The Subjugation of the Zulu and the Sioux, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, NE, 1994, p.64-68 Nongalaza barely escaped by diving into the Tugela River and swimming to safety.

It is widely cultivated and is now naturalized in several places outside its native range.Bailey, L.H. & E.Z. Bailey. 1976. Hortus Third i‚Äìxiv, 1‚Äì1290. MacMillan, New York. Description Allium paniculatum produces several egg-shaped bulbs, each up to 1.5 cm across. No rhizomes. Leaves are tubular and hollow, up to 35 cm long. Scape is round in cross-section, solid, up to 75 cm tall. Inflorescence is (despite the name of the species) an umbel with as many as 100 flowers. Flowers are bell-shaped, about 6 mm across; tepals white to lilac; pollen and anthers yellow.Linnaeus, Carl von. 1759. Systema Naturae, Editio Decima 2: 978.  Taxonomy  A. paniculatum is placed within section Codonoprasum, subgenus Allium. The species has been regarded as highly variable, with up to 30 taxa included in what has been referred to as the A. paniculatum complex, many of which are now regarded as separate species within the section, including Allium dentiferum, A. fuscum, A. oleraceum, A. pallens, and A. tenuiflorum. Many taxa from within the section have been incorrectly attributed to this species causing uncertainty regarding morphological diversity and geographic distribution. For instance the species has been described as widely spread through the whole Euro-Mediterranean and Irano-Turanian areas, as well as in North Africa. However the type specimen comes from Ukraine ad South Russia. Phylogenetically A. paniculatum is in a sister relationship with three other species, namely A. oleraceum and the two western autumnal taxa, A. savii and A. telmatum, forming a subclade within the section. Distribution Allium paniculatum has been reported from every European country bordering on the Black and Mediterranean Seas, including the islands of Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and Crete. It is also considered native in Portugal, the Czech Republic, Hungary, western Siberia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and Palestine. It has become naturalized in California, New York State, Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands, and South Australia.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families However see the above section, in which phylogenetic studies demonstrate that the true distribution is in fact confined to Ukraine and South Russia. The species has been collected in the vicinity of San Francisco Bay in California, as well as isolated locales in Essex County in northeastern New York State. This is of concern because the species has the potential to become a noxious weed. It tends to grow in disturbed sites such as roadsides, cultivate fields, etc.Flora of North America v 26 p 244, Allium paniculatumBONAP (Biota of North America Program) floristic synthesis, Allium paniculatum References  Bibliography  * paniculatum Category:Flora of Europe Category:Flora of temperate Asia Category:Plants described in 1759 Category:Onions Category:Garden plants Category:Edible plants Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Allium paniculatum"},{"id":"42229048","text":"Tinpahar is a bimonthly, bilingual (English and Bengali) Indian online magazine that promotes art, literature, and culture with the motto, \\"Free and Fertile\\".

Recorded at House of Loud in Elmwood Park, New Jersey with producer David Bendeth. It was released on April 17, 2013 in Japan by VAP. The album would also later be released by Hopeless Records on June 23, 2014 in Europe and on June 24, 2014 in North America as a reissue upon being signed internationally for the first time, making The Revelation their first album to be released worldwide. The album would later be released in Australia on August 8, 2014 by Sony Music. The Revelation is the first Coldrain album to be released worldwide by Hopeless Records, and the only album to be released in Australia as a deluxe by Sony Music. It is the third album to be released in Japan by VAP. This would be the followup to 2011's The Enemy Inside, which was the last album to be exclusively released in Japan, and the predecessor to 2015s Vena. The Revelation would be their highest charting album to date on the Oricon Albums Chart, debuting and peaking at number 7, selling over 10,000 copies in its first week. Their other albums peaking in the top 10 did not fare as well, Fateless came the closest, peaking at number 8. The album would produce four different singles from its original Japanese track listing, with the other three released from the international edition, that would be from their 2014 Until the End extended play, which was exclusively released in Japan. The lead single, being the title track \\"The Revelation\\" that was released just over two weeks before the album's release in 2013 on April 1. The second single \\"The War is On\\" was released the following month, while the third single \\"Behind the Curtain\\" was released in January of the following year, the last single to be released prior to their debut international release. \\"Aware and Awake\\" was released after the international release in July 2014, and was borrowed from Until the End to be placed on the international edition as well as four other tracks. \\"House of Cards\\" being the only not released on the international release, but later released as a part of the Australian deluxe. \\"You Lie\\" was later released in September, being the second single released in the new international era. The seventh and final single, \\"Time Bomb\\" was released in March 2015. The Revelation would be a departure from their earlier post- hardcore and punk rock sound from Final Destination and The Enemy Inside, which instead got heavier and swayed into more of an alternative metal sound, while still retaining some post hardcore elements, while also dabbling into the heavier style metalcore at points on this record that tracks a little over 43 minutes long. Critical reception The debut worldwide studio album, The Revelation, received very mixed reviews from critics. The positive reviews were very favourable, however the release also received fairly negative reviews also. The main praises for The Revelation consisted of the melodies and clean vocals by frontman Masato Hayakawa. Max Barrett of Rock Sound, who rated the album a 6/10, noted that: \\"With the quality to fuse a mature, melodic approach with their ear for a clean and catchy chorus (\\"Given Up On You\\"), the Nagoya-based quintet make it virtually impossible to simply sit still and listen. Chuck in the more venomous, metalcore-esque sections (the title track), not to mention the odd ripping solo (\\"Time Bomb\\"), and there‚Äôs enough variation here to formally introduce Coldrain to the world.\\" This point was reiterated by Kersten Lison of Twilight Magazine, \\"The metalcore is extremely dynamic and energetic. In addition, it can convince with a pleasant note of melodic, which is extremely catchy and catchy, but without drifting into the arbitrary. This gives the sound an enormous lightness despite the genre-typical hardness, which is otherwise very rarely heard in this form (\\"Behind The Curtain\\"). Just the right thing for the summer. Almost like a pleasantly cooling summer rain.\\" Many of the songs were strongly praised by DJ Robintje who wrote for Avo-Magazine, who would comment on the anthem like sing-a-long \\"The War is On\\". \\"\\"The War Is On\\" begins with a gentle, relatively short intro. This is followed up by singing which begins slowly and then introduces soft grunts. The alternation between the vocals and the grunting has a pleasant balance. Drums and guitar are clearly present, with a strong and compelling rhythm. Despite the rather dark vocals you will immediately be in the mood to join in, which makes me want to scream along with the chorus. Certainly a song that will catch on during live performances.\\" They would then also go on to praise the highly diverse \\"Time Bomb\\", \\"Time for the fifth song named \\"Time Bomb\\". This track begins with a guitar intro and some solid bass lines. The vocalist sounds more dynamic and aggressive than before, which is supported by reverbs during the rush part. The guitar plays a very important role in this track which is complemented by a very nice beat. The guitar solo later in the song is fantastic! A song with a lot of variety, which still forms a beautiful whole.\\" However, on a more negative review, Rasmus Peters of Metal.de would highly criticise the lack of originality on the record as a whole. \\"Lyrically on the paths of Bullet for My Valentine, but without getting to the choruses or kindness sits or kindness that they have or had without any doubt. Even Linkin Park, when they were still being worshipped on every conventional schoolyard, are a long way off for Coldrain. It simply lacks every spark of originality, no small of it. It doesn't help that the song material itself is solidly arranged and produced.\\" Track listing All lyrics written by Masato Hayakawa, all music composed by Ryo Yokochi, except where noted. ;Japanese edition Personnel Credits retrieved from album's liner notes.

The brand was first launched on cans of coffee in 1908 by Smith Michael (S.M.) Flickinger in Buffalo, New York to compete with A&P; and its popular private brand coffee and was named after the color on the store shelves. The Red & White Wholesale Corporation that grew from S.M. Flickinger's first store in Buffalo, supplied groceries to independent grocery stores, and during World War I, the pressure on the small stores increased as food was rationed. By this time the company was operating as its own chain of Flickinger's retail stores, as well as the wholesale operation supplying other retailers. Today, there are thousands of Red & White products serving as the primary store brand in independent grocery stores across the United States.  History  In 1908 Smith Michael (S.M.) Flickinger developed the first store brand product, cans of coffee, to compete with A&P.; Flickinger named the brand Red & White after the colors of his store shelves and the coffee was a hit. Over the course of the next ten years, a wide assortment of Red & White products was added to Flickinger's store. By 1921, Flickinger's success had grown into a small chain of Red & White stores throughout upstate New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio, while simultaneously supplying other independent stores with Red & White products through his warehouse. This collection of Red & White stores and independent stores became the Red & White stores Voluntary Group System. Membership to the group included site selection, training, discounted store fixtures and professional window display for initial store openings to help avoid the failure of thousands of corner grocers. Following the trademark registration for Red & White in 1925, wholesalers from Canada and the United States began visiting Buffalo to learn about the voluntary concept. Many received permission from Flickinger to set up similar operations, and they spread quickly from coast- to-coast. As the independent Red & White stores spread throughout the United States, the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù of stores kept in close communication through a monthly Red & White magazine that was ‚Äúpublished in Chicago for all Red & White members everywhere.‚Äù During the Great Depression, the independent wholesalers and approximately 6,700 retailers benefited from the ability to collaborate and volume buy the grocery store products through the Voluntary Group System.Convention Address on the Red & White Perspective, Federated Foods \\"Heads of Houses Conference,\\" Palm Springs 1986 The growing private store brand Red & White business came to an abrupt halt when the Robinson-Patman Act, the second amendment to the Clayton Antitrust Act, would no longer allow Red & White stores to price discriminate from unearned brokerage payments. As a result, Leo J. Bushey, President of Red & White Corporation, and four other employees left Red & White and formed a new organization known as Modern Marketing Services. The new organization leased ‚Äúthe brands, trademarks and labels owned or controlled by Red & White. Despite the separation of the two entities, the Federal Trade Commission decided that the arrangement still violated the Robinson-Patman Act, and ordered both Modern Marketing and Red & White to ‚Äúcease and desist from receiving or accepting, directly or indirectly, from the sellers of such commodities, any brokerage fee. This decision was affirmed and enforced on June 13, 1945. In 1945, Modern Marketing was dissolved and Leo J. Bushey, George O Morea and Harmon J Wright for Bushey, Morea & Wright, Inc. to ‚Äúact exclusively as a seller‚Äôs broker‚Äù to solicit orders on manufacturers and packers for unbranded merchandise, merchandise packed under the labels owned by the manufacturers, including the Red & White brand. As a result, Red & White Corporation continued to own various trademarks and trade names, but did not perform any purchasing service for the wholesale grocers who owned it. Bushey, Morea & Wright, Inc. (BM&W;) purchased the Red & White trademark from Red & White Corp in 1955 and reorganized the company to compete in a ‚ÄúSupermarket Era‚Äù by streamlining headquarter operations while transferring many responsibilities to its member distributors. Bushey, Morea & Wright, operating out of Boston, MA, established an irrevocable trust known as The Red & White Foundation and sold the Red & White brand to the foundation for a nominal sum, while Red & White Corporation contributed all the remaining trademarks and brands to the Foundation. The Foundation granted Bushey, Morea & Wright a license to use the trademarks and trade names on a royalty basis. Bushey, Morea & Wright purchased all the outstanding shares of stock of the original Red & White Corporation and changed its own name to Red & White Corporation and took over all advertising functions for the company. In 1963, under the leadership of Donald Albrecht, Red & White Corporation acquired National Brand Sales Corporation, which provided immediate expansion into more areas of the country with a new Hy-Top brand. Shortly thereafter the Parade and Fine Fare brands were also launched by Red & White Corporation. To better serve schools, hospitals, restaurants and in-plant cafeterias, the Red & White Foodservice Division was formed in 1966. However, shortly after launching the new division in 1968, new FDA label regulations prompted a corporate name change to Federated Foods as the holding company, made up of six divisions: Red & White International Division, Hy-Top Products Division, National Brands Sales Division, Kitchen Products Division, and Red & White Foodservice Division. The growing success of store brands continued beyond the 60's and 70's and in 2014 store brands represent 17% of all retail grocery sales in the United States. There are thousands of Red & White products serving as the primary store brand in independent grocery stores across the United States, but the store brand market as a whole has greatly matured. In 1981, a New Corporate Headquarters ‚Äî Federated Foods moves headquarters to Arlington Heights, Illinois. The rest of the Federated divisions joined Federated Foods at this location in 2000. In 1993, a Logistics & Consolidation Solution - Golden Bay, Federated's consolidation and logistics division, is created to make significant operational efficiencies and supply chain cost savings by consolidating the sourcing, procurement, inventory management and distribution of a broad range of products for wholesalers and retailers. In 1996 a Full-Service Design & Marketing Established - SailPointe Creative Group, Federated's full-service creative agency, is established to provide strategic design solutions and outstanding creativity.  Key people  = S.M. Flickinger = Smith Michael (S.M.) Flickinger started Red & White Corporation, the nation's first wholesale and retail business with fully integrated distribution. In 1903, Smith Michael (S.M.) Flickinger left his job as a wholesale grocery clerk in Buffalo, NY to open Flickinger Grocery Store with his brother Burt Flickinger. This would be Buffalo, New York's first $1 billion company that Flickinger opened with $16,000 he had saved. Two decades later in 1926, the brothers helped co-found IGA in 1926. S.M. Flickinger died at the age of 74 in 1939.(3 April 1939). Smith M. Flickinger, Grocery Executive, The New York Times As a result, his son took over Red & White through the World War II years and into the Supermarket Era. = Donald Albrecht = In the early 1960s, Don Albrecht became majority stockholder and chairman of Federated Foods. At that time, Federated Foods was located in Park Ridge, Illinois. In the early 1980s the company relocated to its present location in Arlington Heights, IL. Today, Federated Foods operates as a division of Federated Group. At the time, the company was as much a broker as it was as a brand owner, with a variety of offerings that included ‚Äî and still includes ‚Äî the now-iconic Red & White brand, created in 1908 by S.M. Flickinger. As one who helped shape the grocery industry into what it is today, Albrecht was a man who valued simple solutions and easy-to-execute programs. He also understood the economic, political and technological changes taking place throughout his career. He knew that during a time of when food prices were on the rise, he had to eliminate every frill from the ‚ÄúRed & White Corporation‚Äù to promise the lowest possible cost of Red & White products to Federated's customers. The brand was a hit. And Albrecht realized soon after that if Federated owned more brands, then it could grow and, at the same time, help grocers who desired a private label program but lacked the capacity to develop one. So throughout the 1960s, Federated acquired the Hy-Top and Parade brands under Albrecht's leadership. Albrecht saw an opportunity to further drive retailer and wholesaler customers‚Äô sales by offering them no-name opening-price-point products. Within six weeks of recognizing this opportunity, Federated was offering more than 30 of these products to their customers. Albrecht died in August 1986 at the age of 58. At the time of his death, he was Board Chairman at Federated, according to his obituary in the Chicago Tribune. He also served as a trustee of Harper College in Palatine, Illinois. and was a member of the Board of Directors of Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, IL.

The coordinates of UNOC headquarters are 0¬∞19'42.0\\"N, 32¬∞34'57.0\\"E (Latitude:0.328333; Longitude:32.582500). Overview The government of Uganda (GOU)'s goal as set out in the country's energy policy (2002) and National Oil and Gas policy (2008) is to ensure the sustainable utilization of discovered petroleum resources to contribute to early achievement of poverty eradication and create lasting value to society. One of the key objectives is to ensure an adequate, reliable, and affordable supply of quality petroleum products in the country. The petroleum deposits discovered so far are estimated at 6.5 billion barrels, of which 1.4 billion barrels are considered recoverable. The state can participate with between 15 and 20 percent in production, according to existing production-sharing agreements between the state and the three oil exploration companies: Tullow Oil of the United Kingdom, Total Oil of France, and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation. It is the National Oil Company that will participate in production on behalf of the state. The Uganda Oil Refinery that is in the development phase calls for 40 percent participation by the state. The national oil company will invest in the refinery on behalf of the state. It is also expected that the new oil company will maintain a petroleum products retail network. Plans are underway to develop a 60,000 barrel per day refinery that will serve Uganda and its immediate neighbours. The refinery is being developed on a private-public partnership basis (60 percent to 40 percent). GOU is in the process of finalising the selection process of a strategic investor who will take up the private shareholding. The refinery is expected to boost the security of supply of petroleum products and provide an outlet for the discovered resources. Subsidiaries UNOC has two wholly owned subsidiaries: the Uganda Refinery Holding Company headed by General Manager Michael Nkambo Mugerwa, and the Uganda National Pipeline Company headed by General Manager John Bosco Habumugisha. In May 2017, UNOC began managing the Jinja Petroleum Storage Terminal (JPST), which has a storage capacity of . JPST is joint venture between UNOC and a private company, One Petroleum Limited. The facility had in storage as of November 2017. In December 2018, the shareholders of UNOC resolved that the company will own 15 percent equity in East African Crude Oil Export Pipeline (EACOP), up to 40 percent equity in the Uganda Oil Refinery and at least 51 percent equity in the Kampala Storage Terminal (KST) to be located at Namwabula Village in Mpigi District. UNOC is expected to operate and manage the KST. First oil In March 2018, UNOC concluded the bidding for transporters to move 45,211 barrels of waxy test crude oil, equivalent to from the oilfields in Hoima District, to the Kenyan port of Mombasa. The winner of the tender was expected to be made public in April 2018. At prevailing crude oil prices of US$60 per barrel, the crude, extracted during testing and exploration was valued at about US$2.7 million (KSh271 million). When the first bidding process failed to attract a credible buyer, the oil was re-advertised in June 2018. Failure to dispose of the crude oil before the Uganda oil refinery is completed, will make the refinery the default buyer. At the prevailing trading price of $74 (UShs280,000) per barrel of Brent crude oil, the 45,211 barrels could fetch about US$3.3m (about UShs 13 billion), as of June 2018. In November 2019, the Daily Monitor newspaper reported that Uganda National Oil Company had secured a buyer for the test crude oil. The crude oil is stored in specialized containers at four sites; Kasemene 1, Ngara-1, Ngiri-2 in Buliisa District and at Tangi Camp in Nwoya District. At the prevailing price of WTI crude oil at US$55.06 (USh:202,048) per barrel, the 45,211 barrels could potentially yield US$2,489,318 (about USh9 billion), as of November 2019. Bulk petroleum products trading In March 2020 UNOC signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Stabex International Limited, an oil products distributor in the African Great Lakes Region. UNOC will import oil products in bulk and sell them to Stabex for onward distribution. Other distributors are being sought. According to The EastAfrican, the MV Uhuru, a Kenyan vessel, owned by the Kenya Pipeline Corporation, transports bulk refined oil products (gasoline, diesel-fuel, kerosene and jet fuel) from Kisumu to Jinja Petroleum Storage Terminal and UNOC distributes them nationally and regionally.

It is Rash's fifth novel, his most acclaimed novel being the New York Times bestseller, Serena. The Cove was listed as #16 on the New York Times Bestseller list for Hardcover Fiction in the April 29, 2012 issue of The New York Times Book Review and remained on the list as #29, #22, and #31 for the three subsequent weeks.  Plot  = Part One (Ch. 1‚Äì5) = The novel takes place in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina in 1918. Laurel Shelton lives in the cove with her brother Hank, who has just returned home from fighting in World War I and is missing a hand. Laurel stumbles, unnoticed, upon a man sitting alone in the woods playing a flute. A visit by Laurel to her parents' graves reveal that she and her brother are both orphans; their deaths contributed to the local belief that Laurel is a witch. Laurel is cruelly treated by the locals, especially when Jubel Parton had sex with on a bet. When Laurel again spots the man in the woods, she stops to listen to his music and notes its sadness before heading into the nearest town with Hank and Slidell. An incident in town prompts Laurel to tell her brother about Jubel, and Hank gets into a fight with him. His friend, Chauncey Feith, the town's army recruiter, breaks up the fight and the trio returns home. Meanwhile, Walter Smith, a man who has just escaped some sort of camp, wanders to the cove and stays for three days to heal. On the fourth day he intends to leave, but he suddenly slips and falls and is attacked by a swarm of yellow jackets. He begins to hallucinate. Laurel goes looking for the flute playing man, who we now find out is Walter. He is lying on the ground, obviously badly hurt, and she and Hank bring him back to their cabin. While nursing Walter back to health she discovers a paper in his knapsack identifying him as a mute. She discovers that he is trying to catch a train to New York City. In exchange for his help with chores around the cove, Walter is allowed to stay until their next trip with Slidell. At the end of Part One, Laurel sees Walter hide a medallion between some rocks and, retrieving it, she attempts, unsuccessfully, to discover its significance. = Part Two (Ch. 6‚Äì11) = Chauncey Feith goes to the Turkey Trot to drink with war veterans and send his well wishes to Boyce Clayton, the uncle of a hospitalized soldier, Paul Clayton. Chauncey recruited Paul and has a fondness for him. Chauncey is not well liked by any veterans in town, because he is only a recruiter and has never fought in any war. Chauncey takes two young boys to the Mars Hill library to look for books written in German that might be \\"aiding the enemy.\\" Meanwhile, Walter continues to work in the cove and Laurel wishes he would stay longer. Hank tries to convince him to stay. Laurel kisses Walter, but he walks away immediately thereafter. The next morning, Walter leaves with Slidell without saying goodbye. When he tries to buy a train ticket he realizes his face is on a wanted poster outside of the station. He tries to hop on the train without a ticket but fails, and walks back to the cove. = Part Three (Ch. 12‚Äì16) = Walter has been at the cove for two months. Laurel and Walter are a couple and Laurel is happy. Chaucey takes the petition he has started to have Professor at the college fired for \\"aiding the Huns\\" to a senator and daydreams about having a statue built in his honor for his efforts during the war. Laurel begins to suspect that Walter isn't a mute, and that he can read and write and has only been pretending. She seeks out the help of Miss Calicut to determine the meaning of the word on the medallion Walter had arrived with. Miss Calicut takes her to see Professor Mayer, who tells her its inscription, Vaterland, means \\"Fatherland\\" and was the name of a large German ocean liner that was stranded in the New York Harbor in 1914. For three years its occupants were free to do what they wanted but after the U.S. entered the war in 1917, its occupants were taken to an internment camp in Hot Springs, North Carolina. The Vaterland is now a troop ship known as the Leviathan. The group concludes that the medallion must have belonged to the German escapee and that he is probably long gone by now. Laurel, now hurt and confused by her findings, heads back to the cove and confronts Walter in private. She learns that it is true and that he can speak, read, and write. His real name is Jurgin Walter Koch and he wishes to stay with her after the war is over. = Part Four (Ch. 17‚Äì20) = Hank and Walter work together to dig a well. Laurel buys material to make a dress for when she and Walter can head for NYC when the war is over. Chauncey awaits a letter from governor and finally receives it only to hear that the governor will not attend Paul Clayton's coming home party. Hank and Walter continue to work on the well and Walter nearly has an accident. The incident gave all three a fright, but they're all alright. = Part Five (Ch. 21‚Äì25) = Laurel is happy and dreams of the day she and Walter can leave the cove together. Then November 9 arrives, and it's the day of Paul Clayton's coming home parade that Chauncey has so diligently planned. The Claytons see a wanted poster for Walter and recognize him. They tell Chauncey and they head to the cove armed with weapons. Laurel and Walter are returning home when they spot Chauncey, the Claytons, Jubel, and Hank tied up. Laurel tells Walter to wade up the creek and if she doesn't meet him that night to go on without her. Laurel is discovered by Chauncey and his mob and Chauncey accidentally shoots and kills her. Jubel and Chauncey are the only ones who show no remorse, as the rest are stunned and abandon the hunt for Walter. Fearing Hank will kill him, Chauncey kills Hank while Hank is tied up on the porch. Walter waits for Laurel for three days before finally deciding to return to the cove. He sees the bloodstains and finds two fresh graves. He walks into town to find people celebrating - the war has ended. Walter sees Slidell in the bar and Slidell explains what happened. Chauncey hasn't been seen since, he says. Slidell fends off Jubel and puts Walter on a train out of Mars Hill. Walter intends to go to New York to play his flute.  Awards and nominations  The Cove was listed as #16 on the New York Times Bestseller list for Hardcover Fiction in the April 29, 2012 issue of The New York Times Book Review and remained on the list as #29, #22, and #31 for the three subsequent weeks.

PFM often lets users categorize transactions and add accounts from multiple institutions into a single view. PFM also typically includes data visualizations such as spending trends, budgets and net worth.  History  PFM started in 1983 with the founding of Intuit. Scott Cook and Tom Proulx, the company‚Äôs founders, witnessed the rise of the personal computer and saw an opportunity to develop personal financial software. Their flagship product, Quicken, became a standard for many households and was eventually followed by QuickBooks, which helped small businesses manage their finances. Around the same time, a similar competing product introduced by MECA Software, conceived by MECA President Gerald Rubin, and designed by author Andrew Tobias called Managing-Your-Money (MYM) came out, first running on the Apple-II, and later the IBM-PC. Later in 1990 Microsoft released their own PFM platform called Microsoft Money. Microsoft worked with Intuit and CheckFree in 1997 to create Open Financial Exchange (OFX), which allowed financial institutions to exchange data with web users, paving the way for online PFM software. Yodlee was founded in 1999. Originally a site that let users view email, banking, news, travel, and shopping in one place, it soon pivoted to focus exclusively on banking, allowing users to view their financial accounts from different institutions all at once. Also eWise was founded in 2000 and implemented off- the-shelf digital money management at Australia's Westpac as early as 2001. eWise invented 'client-side' data aggregation, allowing sensitive financial information to be aggregated on an end user's server or chosen device, for example, a smartphone. This form of data aggregation differs from the external server / cloud-based model of 'server-side' aggregation and is considered to offer consumers higher levels of data protection when managing their money over the internet. Because building, managing and maintaining a robust account aggregation engine is complex and requires ongoing effort, many of the PFM providers do not offer their own account aggregation engine. Other providers of account aggregation include Plaid, SaltEdge, Teller, TrueLayer, BudgetInsights and many others following the introduction of open banking frameworks such as PSD2 in Europe. A wave of online PFM tools launched around 2006, with Wesabe and Mint at the forefront. Mint was acquired by Intuit in 2009 for $170 million, and Wesabe went under in 2010. Wesabe‚Äôs CEO cited the fact that Mint automatically aggregated accounts and transactions as a key reason that Wesabe lost market share to Mint. Since 2008, PFM has expanded in scope. Financial advisory companies such as LearnVest, Personal Capital and Credit Karma integrate PFM into their software. Direct banks like Simple and Moven do the same. In addition, several companies have focused on selling PFM directly to financial institutions. These companies include Meniga, Digital Insight, Geezeo, MX and Strands, who also help banks deliver digital financial management for small businesses. Around 2015, new PFM capabilities driven by advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have been introduced to the market by companies such as Moneythor and Personetics and deployed by financial institutions including the Royal Bank of Canada and UK challenger banks Tandem and Metro Bank.  Typical features  At its core, PFM allows users to aggregate financial transactions in one place and then use that data to manage their money. In some cases, these transactions have to be entered manually, but an increasing percentage of products automate the process. PFM typically shows cash flow, spending trends, goals, net worth, and debt management. It also allows users some level of customization for managing their money. New PFM capabilities powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that have been recently introduced to the market include predictive cash flow analysis, personalized financial advice, and automated money management including autonomous savings.

Adena Springs has won the Canadian Sovereign Award for Outstanding Breeder six times, plus four earlier wins under Stronach's own name. Adena Springs has stood multiple stallions at its various farms since 1996. Their first important stallion was El Prado, who was the leading sire in North America for 2002, and an influential sire of sires, including Medaglia d'Oro and Kitten's Joy, himself the leading sire in 2012. They next expanded their program by adding half-brothers Awesome Again and Macho Uno. , the operation stands 18 stallions. In 2013, Adena Springs stood three of the top 15 stallions in the Thoroughbred industry, with stud fees ranging from $3,500 to $75,000 for various stallions. Adena Springs began as a nursery to produce horses for Stronach Stables. Famous homebreds include Breeders' Cup Classic winner Awesome Again and his best son, Horse of the Year Ghostzapper, both of whom stand at Adena. With the expansion of the farm, Adena is now a major seller of young thoroughbreds. Horses bred and sold by Adena include Game On Dude and Judy the Beauty. Organization and history  The first Adena Springs location was a farm near Versailles, Kentucky, purchased in 1989. The farm was named after the Adena, who were the earliest known inhabitants of the region. Adena Springs Kentucky expanded to its current facility located in Bourbon County near Paris, Kentucky in 2005. The Adena Springs South farm is located in Williston, Florida, which is north of Ocala and was established in 1996 when the initial were purchased, with an additional added in 1999. The Florida facility now has and in addition to housing several stallions, it is where the young Thoroughbreds begin their race training. The Adena Springs North farm is located in Aurora, Ontario, and houses several stallions. It is also home to a retirement program that prepares Thoroughbreds for second careers by retraining them and rehabilitating any injuries they may have. The goal is to place these horses in permanent adoptive homes and as of 2014 over 100 horses had been placed. Horses that are retired from racing but are not suitable for adoption are permanently retired to the Adena facility in Florida. The original concept for opening a stud farm in Canada was to produce horses deemed competitive on the international market.

The region is within the Driftless Area, a region noted for its karst topography, which includes caves and sinkholes. Tyson's cave is a solutional cave privately owned by the Minnesota Cave Preserve. It is known for the extinct ice-age bones found scattered throughout the cave rooms. The majority of this extensive cave is approximately 120 feet below the surface and is estimated to be 3.5‚Äì5 miles in length, making it the 258th longest cave in the United States. History After the War of 1812, the United States deeded a parcel of land containing the natural entrance to Tyson Spring Cave to a war widow, who then deeded the property to Mr. Harper Tyson in 1862. Residents of Fillmore County would venture into the cave using wooden boats but were prevented from going any further than 800 feet because the passage was completely submerged in water. In the 1980s, local caver Roger Kehret began removing piles of rocks near the entrance in hopes of lowering the water level enough to pass through the sump. In 1985, Larry Laine and Steve Porter used SCUBA gear to dive through and reported that the cave indeed did continue into the unknown. Shortly thereafter, Roger Kehret and Dave Gerboth assisted John Ackerman in removing a constriction that lowered the water level enough for them to enter the cave without diving gear. John was the first non-diver to enter the cave, and alone, he ventured deeper. He eventually reached the end of the cave system and reported his findings to the scientific community. Since the cave could only be accessed during low water conditions, very few cavers entered this cave over the next 20 years. In 2006, John Ackerman, owner of the Minnesota Cave Preserve, purchased the land above the cave, along with 143 acres of subterranean rights as they pertain to the cave system. The preserve created a 124-foot entrance shaft to allow safe entry into the cave and placed a gate at the natural entrance to prevent unauthorized access. Entry is available to scientists, select nature groups, and Minnesota Caving Club members and is tightly controlled. In 2008, John Ackerman and two fellow cavers found an ancient stag moose antler, which initiated the discovery of over 175 extinct ice-age bones. Bone discovery In 2008, Ackerman and several other cavers began to excavate a side passage in the cave and discovered an ancient bone. He brought the bone to David Mather at the St. Paul History Center, who was able to identify it as part of an elk or moose, but was unable to identify the exact species. The bone was then sent to the Illinois State Museum's assistant curator, Chris Widga. The Illinois State Museum identified the ancient bone to be a prehistoric Stag-Moose (Cervalces Scotti) antler, which is the first record of a stag-moose in Minnesota. Shortly thereafter, Chris Widga was examining the discovery site of the antler when he discovered the skull to an ancient saber-tooth cat (Homotherium serum), which is the first record of a saber-tooth cat in the Great Lakes region. The nearest discovery of a saber-tooth cat is in northern Arkansas. The Rafter Radiocarbon National Isotope Center in New Zealand used radiocarbon dating to identify that the Saber-tooth cat lived approximately 27,000 years ago. Paleontologists were stunned when Penn State lab successfully amplified and sequenced DNA from the extinct saber-tooth cat. Since the discovery of the stag-moose antler and the saber-tooth cat skull, more than 175 ancient bones dating between 27,590 and 26,200 years old have been found in Tyson Spring Cave and Bat River Cave.

Early life and education  White was born in Chester, Pennsylvania, to Ruth Eleanor White and Irving Cyril White. She began playing piano at 8, after she saw a classmate perform, and learned to read hymns before beginning to study classical music at 11. At 13, she expanded her repertoire to include jazz and had her first recital. \\\\- Three years later, her aunt, a church choir director, asked Sunshine to fill in for her during a Sunday service at a Catholic church; she was subsequently hired by churches of all denominations, including the AME Church, where she performed with the award-winning Wilmington/Chester Mass Choir. White, who sang in her high school choir, graduated from the Country Day School of the Sacred Heart in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, in 1993. She attended Spelman College in Atlanta, and although she enrolled as a piano major, she changed course after she became disillusioned with the music program.

In addition to performing in Africa, DaisyRew performed at churches in the area and at clubs, including the Apache Caf√©, which was noted for launching the careers of several prominent artists, including India.Arie. Wilson was cast in a Broadway role following college, and Sunshine was hired as the Minister of Music at the St. Paul AME Church in Atlanta. DaisyRew continued to perform when Wilson, on breaks from her theatrical career in New York, returned to Atlanta. While working at the St. Paul AME Church, White met Dana Johnson, a guitarist, producer and songwriter who had previously worked with India.Arie. White, Johnson and Wilson began working together in 2003 with Johnson writing and producing the music, in addition to managing DaisyRew's career.

In 2005, White and Johnson recorded \\"Stalker\\", a neo soul song, which a friend, Chris Brann, set to a house beat. The track became a dance hit on a Japanese record label, which led to a series of live dates in Japan. White and Johnson began work on what became AverySunshine‚Äôs self-titled first album, released in 2010 on their own label, BigShine. Recorded mainly at White‚Äôs home with ProTools, the record included guest appearances by the pianist Takana Miyamoto, the vibraphone player Roy Ayers and Christian McBride. The record was praised by the media, with USA Today calling it \\"refreshingly original\\" and The Washington Post describing it as \\"a radiant brand of soul\\". \\\\- \\\\- White ‚Äî a single mother of two ‚Äì focused on AverySunshine, but also accepted jobs as a keyboard player with artists including Tyler Perry and Jennifer Holliday and worked as a choral director for Atlanta performances by artists such as Michael Bubl√©, Anthony Hamilton and David Foster. \\\\- From 2010 until late 2013, AverySunshine toured consistently, and developed a following throughout the United States, the UK, Europe and Africa.

The sculpture was originally sited at the west front of the old Capitol building and was relocated during construction of the new Capitol building (c. 1936‚Äì1937). It was reoriented to face west, symbolizing the westward migration to Oregon, in January 1853. A tree fell on the statue during the Columbus Day Storm of 1962, knocking it off its pedestal.

The decline in both serum and total testosterone with age have been linked to several disease states in men. In particular, cardiac failure and ischemic heart disease have been linked to this natural biochemical decline in testosterone. Previously, the higher cardiovascular risk in men has been attributed in part to the negative effects of systemic testosterone, however, more recent research has highlighted the protective nature of testosterone against cardiovascular disease. The magnitude and mechanism of action by which low testosterone in men is influential in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular risk and the potential benefits of testosterone therapy has yet to be fully determined. Systemic effects of testosterone on the cardiovascular system Low testosterone is associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease through the promotion of a pro-atherosclerotic environment.https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/ReproductiveHealthDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM413736.pdf Some research has identified testosterone as a vasodilator and an endothelium- repairing hormone within many regions in the body, including the coronary arteries. Recent research depicts testosterone as important in decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6, which are influential in atherosclerotic profiles. Although it is believed that the reduction in inflammatory cytokines is related to a decreased atherosclerotic profile, the full explanation of this mechanism requires further research. Testosterone has also shown to be effective as an anti-atherosclerotic through preventing aortic cholesterol deposition in both rabbits fed high cholesterol diets and mice with low- density lipoprotein gene knockout. Fatty deposition within the aorta associated with low endogenous testosterone has been determined to be independent of the androgen receptor. Although the mechanism has yet to be fully determined, aromatase activity and the activation of estrogen receptor alpha is partially responsible for the atherosclerotic profile characteristic of low testosterone. Decreased systemic testosterone in men has also been reported in men with heart failure, whereby the severity of the disease is proportional to the reduction in systemic testosterone levels. Although a direct mechanism of action is not fully understood, some research attribute low testosterone to advancing side effects of heart failure, such as decreased exercise ability, decreased muscle mass, fatigue/dyspnea and cachexia. Testosterone replacement therapy Physiological testosterone is crucial for normal functionality in men. Long-term administration of physiological testosterone in mouse models has shown to be atheroprotective by increasing the HDL portion of cholesterol (the anti-atherosclerotic cholesterol). The beneficial action of testosterone in elevating the HDL fraction can be attributed to its conversion via aromatase activity in adipose tissue into 17-beta estradiol and its subsequent activation of estrogen alpha-receptors; thus, more testosterone leads to greater conversion into estrogen and thus a healthier lipid profile. This understanding has been determined in several studies, although results of these studies are contradictory. Testosterone replacement therapy in men diagnosed with pre-existing heart disease has been related to an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Furthermore, recent research has linked testosterone replacement therapy to an increase in deaths and other cardiovascular occurrences in men whom document a history of coronary artery disease. Further research is required to determine the full extent to which testosterone replacement therapy in aging men plays a role in the risk and/or advantage of cardiovascular occurrences.

Prior to Al Jazeera America's launch, the show was originally going to start as a weekly program and progress to a daily by the end of 2013 but the show ended up becoming a daily show with the channel's launch. It began as a strictly financial program that focused on the American and global economy and how it affects the average person. It also looks at how national and world events affect or could affect the economy and looks at everyday economic issues and tries to deliver actionable solutions. This is done through in- depth stories on a particular topic and through interviews done by Velshi with economic scholars, economic advisers and small business owners who are affected by the story. The show later expended to cover more current affairs topics. The show was originally 30 minutes from 7 to 7:30 pm eastern time from its launch but was later expanded to a full hour on April 21, 2014.

It consists of a bun of puff-pastry filled with thick custard cream; it is topped with almonds and often decorated with icing sugar.  History  The Dictionary of Basque gastronomy defines the \\"pantxineta\\" as a tart of puff- pastry and custard cream created at the beginning of the 20th century in San Sebasti√°n by the House of Otaegui, a local patisserie, ca. 1915. Back then, San Sebastian was a summer vacation resort for the Spanish royalty, aristocrats and bourgeoisie; patisseries and restaurants thrived, usually serving food and dishes heavily influenced by the cuisine of nearby France. Apparently, the pantxineta was devised in an attempt to imitate traditional French frangipane tarts; however, instead of employing the usual almond-based frangipane filling, a baker at Otaegui used a thick custard, and covered the tart with an outer layer of puff-pastry. They initially called the desert a \\"frantxi-pan\\", which in the local basque dialect quickly evolved into \\"pantxineta\\".  Characteristics  Since its inception, the desert has grown in popularity due to its simplicity and tastiness, and it is nowadays considered one of the cornerstone desserts of basque gastronomy. It is usually served warm, either reheated or, whenever possible, straight out of the baking oven. Sometimes it is served along hot chocolate syrup, which is poured on top of the pastry.  Ingredients  The principal ingredients of the pantxineta are milk, butter, sugar, eggs, flour, almonds and hazelnuts.

The relationship has been worked out by Tom Gueldemann, Edward Elderkin and Anne- Maria Fehn. Classification Pronouns and some basic vocabulary have been reconstructed as being common to Khoe and Kwadi. Because Kwadi is poorly attested, it is difficult to tell which common words are cognate and which might be loans, but about 50 lexical correspondences and a common verb construction have been identified. Westphal's fieldnotes on Kwadi were still being analyzed as of 2018, with the hope that additional grammatical parallels could be identified. Gueldemann (forthcoming) reports the following reconstructed pronominal system, of a minimal/augmented type: {class=wikitable !Person !!Minimal (sg/dual PN)!!Augmented (pl PN) - !1incl *mu ? - !1sg *ti~ta (allomorphs) ? - !2 *sa *o or *u - !3masc *base-(?)-E *base-(?)-u - !3fem *base-(s)E *base-(?)-E } where is an undetermined front vowel and the pronoun base was a deictic like *xa or a generic noun like *kho 'person'. The 3rd-person suffixes were also used on nouns, which in addition had a dual suffix *-da. Both Kwadi and the Khoe languages have verb constructions where the first, dependent verb is marked by a suffix *-(a)Ra and the following, finite verb is unmarked. The nearest relative of Khoe‚ÄìKwadi may be the Sandawe isolate; the Sandawe pronoun system is very similar to that of Kwadi‚ÄìKhoe, but there are not enough known correlations for regular sound correspondences to be worked out. However, the relationship has some predictive value, for example if the back-vowel constraint, which operates in the Khoe languages but not in Sandawe, is taken into account.

The siege lasted from 19 to 21 October, where the Spanish garrison of Ootmarsum under the governor, Otto Van Den Sande, surrendered and was then occupied by the besiegers. The siege was part of Maurice's successful offensive against the Spaniards during the same year. After the capture of Enschede and with the exodus of the surrendered Spanish garrison, Maurice went with the Dutch and English army to Oldenzaal.Knight, Charles Raleigh: Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment. Vol I. London, Gale & Polden, 1905, p. 45 Before Maurice got there however he decided then to split his army with the main army headed to Oldenzaal and a force under Count Van Duivenvoorde sent to Ootmarsum in order to submit the city to his authority. Siege and capture As with the capture of Enschede the same process took place; a Dutch trumpeter under a flag of truce was sent to the gate of Ootmarsum to demand the surrender. Duivenvoorde threatened that under Maurice's orders his army would inflict the same destruction that befell Bredevoort and Groenlo during their capture a few weeks before.Wagenaar pg 474-75 The garrison commander Otto van den Sande replied that the King had commanded him to defy the besiegers and hold firm and that he himself could not surrender as only someone with a higher authority could so. Sande thus ordered continuous cannon fire from the ramparts which continued over the whole night, causing casualties amongst the English troops digging a siege trench. Embroidery of Ootmarsum at time of siege Maurice on hearing the report of the resistance, subsequently sent four heavy guns to Ootmarsum. The following evening Dutch engineers started to make approaches towards the cities southern ramparts and spent that time putting two large siege guns in position. On the north side English troops and engineers did the same and brought up three artillery cannons in position. In Ootmarsum the following day the new siege works were noticed and the incessant bombardment was resumed on these newly dug positions. Van den Sande soon realized his position was hopeless and with no hope of relief asked for the written terms of Maurice to be handed over. This time there was immediate capitulation, and the company of Spanish and German troops consisting of 120 men pulled out of the city, taking with them two banners, two guns, 800 pounds of gunpowder, 2000 fuses, four tons of flour, and other provisions. The written honors of war was that the garrison was to remain behind the Meuse for the allotted time of three months where they were not to engage in combat. Dutch and English troops took over and Van Duivenvoorde ordered the fortifications and outer moat of Ootmarsum to be demolished as had been done in Enschede. At the same time, Maurice with the main army was busy with the siege of Oldenzaal which capitulated a day later.

Gottfried (May 15, 1926 ‚Äì May 26, 2007) was an American home builder, developer and real estate entrepreneur whose signature French Regency-style residences remain sought-after, highly prized addresses in world-famous Palm Beach, Florida. A prolific, visionary builder and design aficionado, he created more than 500 luxury homes which made an enduring imprint on the area. About 400 of his homes were built in the wealthy island town.  Early life  The son of Florence Ward and William Gottfried, Robert was born in Queens, New York. His father operated a residential construction business creating homes and vacation cottages on Long Island. In 1954, at the age of 28, young Gottfried moved to Palm Beach to work with an uncle.  Career and Family  Gottfried Regency 748 Hi Mount Rd Palm Beach, FL 33480 The first house he built was of brick, in the 200 block of Wells Road. His client was prominent Chicago industrialist Rudolph W. Glasner, an Austrian immigrant who held patents for his inventions in machine parts for the automotive industry. Glasner and Gottfried formed a partnership and purchased an entire block in the island's North End. Their $90,000 investment led to the creation of 16 homes on what would become El Dorado Lane. Gottfried had already opened a design center in West Palm Beach. He branched out, adding a marble factory, mirror factory and a company to produce specialty moldings. Aiming to expand further, he formed a development company, and Robert W. Gottfried Inc. was incorporated in 1955. From the time he moved to Palm Beach, he never lived in a house he did not build. \\"I got to know how a house should work that way, what works and what doesn't,\\" he said in an interview. As an indication of his pride in his work, the exteriors of his houses built in the 1970s and '80s had a bronze plaque stating, \\"Built by Robert W. Gottfried Inc.\\" Heeding local architect Clarence Mack's observation about the advantages of having a specialty, Gottfried recalled the elegant lines of buildings he had seen in Paris. Thus, he chose Regency to dress up the vernacular of architecture in Palm Beach‚Äîwhere the style and palette had been dominated since the 1920s by Mediterranean-Revival. Gottfried intuited the market correctly, as \\"Gottfried Regency\\" became a recognized brand within the first decade, with buyers drawn to high ceilings and clean classical lines. Dovetailing the trend, designers at Benjamin Moore paints mixed a custom hue known as \\"Gottfried Gray.\\" His clients included industry tycoons, celebrities and other bold-faced names‚Äîand it was not uncommon for someone to arrive on the island \\"... to buy a Gottfried.\\" Several streets in Palm Beach are synonymous with his Regency interpretations, as he built several streets of \\"French Gottfried\\"‚ÄîCasa Bendita, Chapel Hill, Chateau Drive, El Dorado Lane, El Mirasol, Polmer Park Road, and Via Los Incas. In 1978, Gottfried bought Los Incas, a six-acre oceanfront estate in the Venetian style. The seller was widowed socialite Mary Sanford, whose late husband, Stephen \\"Laddie\\" Sanford, was a textile heir and polo player. Gottfried razed the 12-bedroom palazzo and replaced it with 10 demi-ones which sold for about $3 million each. Along Polmer Park, Gottfried built Gardenia House, which sits on a lakefront cul-de- sac with a quite lofty elevation. Built in 1969 and renovated in 2001, the house epitomized the developer's trademark style and attention to detailing, symmetry and classic lines. According to historian Augustus Mayhew, Gottfried's extensive contribution to the Palm Beach landscape was \\"...modern interiors designed for conveniences rather than antiques.\\" Highly innovative, Gottfried incorporated desirable extras in his houses which heretofore in Palm Beach were confined to custom designs. Features such as the loggia, library, gallery, butler pantry, silver closet, built-in media and security systems drew buyers also attracted to his distinctive inlaid stone driveways. In 1970, Gottfried married Martha Heines, who had moved to Palm Beach in 1967 from the Midwest. She continued to work with her husband, coordinating contracts between customers buying his houses and a network of design and decor vendors. By 1974, the developer had expanded further into building luxury homes on speculation. Thus, the couple launched a real estate brokerage, Martha A. Gottfried Inc., which set an industry standard from the outset. Transactions reached the $100 million mark by the mid-1980s. At one time, the firm operated three offices on the island, including the flagship location on the famed shopping street, Worth Avenue. In addition to his preferred specialty of French Regency, Gottfried served clients interested in other styles. In 1973, he built a Georgian mansion designed by architect John Volk, at 1930 S. Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach, as well as contemporary and Tuscan styles. In an interview published in the November 2014 edition of Architectural Digest magazine about the book \\"Palm Beach People\\" with coauthor Hilary Geary Ross, when asked \\"What's your favorite modern residence in Palm Beach?\\", she responded \\"Fashion designer Lisa Perry's house, by the late Palm Beach developer Robert Gottfried, is completely white but punctuated with bold, colorful art. It's so bright and cheerful that you have to smile when you step inside...\\" In 1991, when New York financier Gerald Tsai Jr. bought The Reef, an historic Art Deco/Moderne estate at 702 N. County Road, he hired Gottfried to rebuild it. Designed by Maurice Fatio, the oceanfront compound was all the rage at the 1937 Paris Exhibition, where it won the Gold Medal as the best modern building in the world at that time. Tsai acquired The Reef a year after it was declared a town landmark. Aware of Gottfried's reputation for sensitivity to all building styles, he engaged the builder in a rare enterprise in Palm Beach‚Äîthe complete reconstruction of a landmarked structure. Tsai sold the property in 1996 to Metromedia executive Stuart Subotnick, an art collector and owner of thoroughbreds. Subotnick sold The Reef in 2007 to developer Stephen M. Ross, chairman of The Related Companies and owner of the Miami Dolphins NFL franchise. In 1984, Gottfried acquired a lakefront parcel and built a mansion for himself and Martha at 748 Hi-Mount Road, with custom features found nowhere else on the island. Sited on two- thirds of an acre overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway, the two-story home rests on an ancient coral ridge at the highest elevation in Palm Beach. It is a pristine walled compound of seclusion behind large wrought-iron security gates. In December 1991, Martha Gottfried died of cancer at the age of 54. The couple had no children. Robert and Pamela Gottfried In 1992, Broker Associate Pamela Hoffpauer, a long-time agent with the firm, was named president of Martha A. Gottfried Inc. A few years later, she and the developer married. She has been a leader in the town's business community, having been President of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, and serving on the Town of Palm Beach Board of Code Enforcement, and the Town Zoning Commission.  Legacy  After Robert Gottfried's death in 2007, Pamela remained President and owner of Martha A. Gottfried Inc. when the firm was acquired by New York-based brokerage Douglas Elliman. Pamela Hoffpauer Gottfried continues as a Broker Associate with the firm, and one of her listings is the home she shared with her husband at 748 Hi-Mount Road and is valued at about $19 million as of March 2014. Featured in a YouTube video, the house has six bedrooms, 11 full bathrooms, four half-baths, marble floors, casement windows, a temperature- controlled wine cellar, a movie theater, billiard room, gym, cabana and grill room overlooking the swimming pool, a concrete \\"deep water\\" dock capable of accommodating a large yacht, and a full-house generator. With high ceilings‚Äîeven a two-story closet in the master suite and two-story greenhouse windows facing the lake‚Äîthe house reveals superior architectural detailing. With formal columns and clerestories above arched windows, the house made a vivid statement when built and continues to draw admirers and prospective buyers. Robert Gottfried's legacy extends beyond the homes he built across Palm Beach. His innovative bent spilled over to related fields, including landscaping and construction materials. \\"Robert Gottfried built his signature style, in partnership with architect John B. Gosman, into a definitive Palm Beach genre, where his companies controlled almost every aspect of the house's construction, having established Palm Beach Marble & Tile, Classic Moulders, Imports Unlimited, Classic Polyroof Co. and the PaverLock Driveway Co.\\" In the 1980s, he collaborated with Duane Cronenwett of North Palm Beach, who had worked for another Gottfried company. Their inventions received several grants from the U.S. Patent Office in the 1980s. One patent was for a roofing system. A few involved an apparatus and method for injecting trees with nutrients and therapeutic liquids. Their joint venture, Tree Saver Inc., was a timely response which is credited with helping to avert a major crisis on the island. Lethal yellowing disease had already killed many varieties of palm trees all over South Florida. He was a quiet supporter of local children's charities as well as those in North Carolina, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital References Further reading *Elle Decor Magazine \\"PALM BEACH POP: LISA PERRY'S FLORIDA HOME\\" article External links *Photo Gallery for Palm Beach Regency by Slim Aarons *James Edition article \\"THE REAL PALM BEACH\\" *New York Social Diary article \\"Palm Beach Real Estate Roulette\\" *Video presentation for Gottfried Regency at 748 Hi Mount Road Palm Beach, FL *Pamela Gottfried at Douglas Elliman Real Estate Palm Beach *Chicago Tribune 1992 article \\"Slow Market?

After arriving in England around 1720, Scheemakers went into partnership with the English sculptor Sir Henry Cheere, 1st Baronet on a monument to Robert Bertie, 1st Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven (c. 1728; Edenham, Lincolnshire), in which the life-size figure of the Duke clad in Roman armour is flanked by Corinthian columns. He also collaborated with the Flemish sculptor Laurent Delvaux In 1726 John van Nost the younger was his apprentice. In 1733 he left England to live in Paris where he died on 18 July 1748.

The line is under the administrative jurisdiction of Central Railway.http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/how-different-things- work/1/18367.html History Narkhed and Amravati towns in Maharashtra's orange belt have waited for more than 80 years to be linked by rail. The 140-km track was first sanctioned in 1928 under the British but stayed on the backburner. The project was revived only in 1993/94 and a budget of Rs 2.84 billion approved. The then-Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao laid the foundation stone. But protests by the Shiv Sena, which opposed the displacement of people, stalled the project for many more years. In September 2008, when President Pratibha Patil inaugurated the New Amravati railway station, it seemed as if the project would be completed soon. Far from it. In November 2009, the Railway Ministry announced the link would be inaugurated in December 2010. But in January 2011, after doing protest by Krupal who is one of the youth leaders among the region then finally it has been completed the project and opened for the people. Railway station This railway route has thirteen railway station excluding Narkhed, New Amravati and Badnera. Those are Narkhed, Mowad, Pusla, Warud Orange City, Benoda, Pala, Hiwarkhed, Morshi, Astegoan, Kolvihir, Chandur Bazar, Sirla, Walgaon, New Amravati and Badnera. Other aspects The area from which this railway route is passing is agricultural rich belt, famous for orange and cotton growing. The route directly connects many places of tourist interest, including: * Hanuman Temple of Belona. * Nal-Damyanti Sagar Dam Morshi * Muktagiri Jain Temple * Chikhaldara Hill Station * Melghat Tiger Reserve * Amba Devi Temple Amravati * Gurukunj Mozari Optional route This route has become very important because it provided the connectivity between two important railway route in India. The New Delhi‚ÄìChennai Grand trunk route and Howrah‚ÄìNagpur‚ÄìMumbai line both have heavy passenger, as well as goods, train traffic. In the case of the Narkhed‚ÄìAmravati line, there is the option of diverting the train on this route to continue the rail traffic. Already two times this kind of situation faced by railway when the train had diverted on the route which showed the importance of the route. Due to continuous and heavy rains on 19 July 2013, the ballast under the railway track and bank including minor bridge had been washed out completely between Sindi and Tuljapur station on Nagpur ‚Äì Wardha section.http://www.cr.indianrailways.gov.in/view_detail.jsp?lang=0&dcd;=1323&id;=0,4,268 12 bogies of the goods train derailed between Sonkhamb and Kohli railway stations on Narkhed‚ÄìNagpur section on 30 January 2014 https://www.nagpurtoday.in/goods-train-derails-near-nagpur-all-delhi-bound- trains-diverted-few-cancelled/ Hence we can say that this route provides an optional route to both the heavy traffic route.

History =Nieuw Nunspeet= In 1890 Frank van Vloten (1858‚Äì1930), from the Dutch patrician family Van Vloten, purchased the estate Groeneveld in Hulshorst, in the municipality of Nunspeet. He sold the property in 1891 to his wife Constance Lans and they finally moved into the property in 1893. In 1895 Frank van Vloten purchased land closer to the village of Nunspeet and together with his brother Willem van Vloten he founded the company Nieuw Nunspeet. In 1902 another 360-hectare patch of land was added to the company. In 1906 the first stone was laid of a round villa which would become known as Het Ronde Huis (The Round House). =House= The Round House had three floors and a flat roof. An entrance road circled around the house towards the main entrance on the second floor which had a balcony all around the house. The round inner gallery on the third floor received daylight through a couloured glass dome in the roof. After the establishment of the Round House the surroundings were transformed to a landscape park. =Estate= The estate included roughly the area between Nunspeet railway station and Vierhouten, with remains of the park still visible in the form of ponds surrounded with Rhododendron bushes and a Honey locust. Van vloten experimented with different forestry management methods and introduced several alien tree species and plants. Nowadays, the Nunspeet golf course is situated on part of the former estate. =Narrow gauge tramway= Frank van vloten constructed a pony-drawn tramway from his estate to Nunspeet railway station. It was built in Decauville-style portable rail track. One surviving tram carriage was restored to working order at the and now resides at the heritage railway. =Death of Frank van Vloten= Frank van Vloten died in 1930. The estate was divided and sold. The house and its surroundings became now property of Staatsbosbeheer and started deteriorating, other parts of the estate were clearcut by a local forester. Second World War During the Second World War the house was used as a labour camp of the Dutch Arbeitseinsatz. Nearby refugees hid in the forest in a shelter later to become known as the Verscholen Dorp (Hidden village). In 1944 a Rheinbote ballistic missile launchpad was constructed on the estate. Demise After the war the former labour camp became a family resort for social weak families and from 1961 to 1966 it was a holiday camp. At the end of the sixties it was decided to demolish the house and camp. Conspiracy theories Articles published in 1976 and 2006 speculated that Frank van Vloten organised orgies and occult rituals at the Round House. In 2011 a Dutch weblog published an even more extreme version of these rumours and the subject was debated on the Dutch FOK! forum, where several participants started an investigation. In 2012 a controversial book was published which stated that Frank van Vloten was a member of a Pan-Germanist cultThe mysteries Of The Round House ‚Äì Dark rituals and the publication attracted some media coverage. Two magazines, Skepter and G-Geschiedenis, put the theory in question in 2013, Agnes Tieben, 'Het Ronde Huis van Wodan', Skepter, 27 September 2013, p.30‚Äì34. Wilmar Taal, 'De sage van het Ronde Huis bij Nunspeet', G-Geschiedenis, July 2013. followed by two crime thrillers in 2014, loosely based on the rumours. A new non-fiction book was published on June 14, 2014 in which the conspiracy theories are dubbed a saga. There are absolutely no grounds to suspect Frank van Vloten as a pan-German occultist and a lot of written statements have proven that nothing out of the ordinary happened in the extraordinary house., Wie Nunspeet zegt, zegt Van Vloten.

Occasionally, his fellow artists from the Academy would join him. Prior to 1890, his works showed heavy influence from the Dutch Masters. His later works are notable for an almost reverential approach to depicting nature in detail. Among his favorite subjects were Schwaan, the surrounding villages and scenes along the Warnow River. From 1903 to 1914, he exhibited regularly at the Glaspalast (Munich).

The casting was announced in January 2014. Madeline was introduced as the estranged mother-in-law of Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton) and mother of Silas' comatose wife Nina Reeves (Michelle Stafford) and, biological aunt of Nathan West (Ryan Paevey) ‚Äî whom she raised as her own. Madeline is also revealed to be the estranged sister of established character Dr. Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati) having remade herself. Mills wrapped her initial stint in May 2014. Though the character was supposed to be short-term, Mills reprised the role of Madeline from October 2014 to January 2015. The character once again resurfaced in May 2015. Her returns have centered on Madeline's attempts to get back in her son's good graces and get her hands on the family fortune. The character was created by head writer Ron Carlivati and patterned after Mills' iconic Knots Landing character, Abby Cunningham. The casting was very well received despite her character's name and backstory remaining a secret until her debut. On-Air On-Soaps referred to the news as \\"bombshell\\", while Jamey Giddens of Daytime Confidential raved about the casting choice and said Mills' character would definitely make for \\"must see\\" TV. Mills won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Guest Performer in a Drama Series in 2015. Storylines Madeline comes to Port Charles in March 2014 demanding that Silas Clay (Michael Easton) sign over his claim to her comatose daughter's estate. Madeline is soon revealed to be the mother of Nathan West (Ryan Paevey), the man investigating Nina's 20-year-old attempted murder case. Madeline claims that Nina has recently died from pneumonia and a devastated Silas finally signs the papers. When Nathan sets a trap to catch Nina's killer, Madeline herself falls into the trap. She admits to overdosing Nina to kill her unborn child because said child would have inherited Nina's estate. While in jail, Madeline reunites with her estranged sister Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati) and she is forced to reveal that Liesl is actually Nathan's biological mother after he nearly sleeps with Liesl's daughter Britt Westbourne (Kelly Thiebaud). Just before she is extradited to New York to stand trial, Madeline informs Nathan that Nina (Michelle Stafford) is very much alive. Having avoided conviction, Madeline returns in October 2014 and reveals to Nathan and Liesl that Nina has been faking her injuries and that Nina also secretly controls the family estate. Madeline explains that Nina has been unstable since she was a child and is prone to violence. Nina confronts Madeline and threatens her until Madeline agrees to help her kidnap Ava Jerome (Maura West)'s newborn baby. They manage to get away only for Nina to double cross Madeline knocking her unconscious. She is discovered and sent to the hospital where she is immediately placed under arrest. As Madeline is transferred to prison, she is stunned when Nathan claims Victor Cassadine (Thaao Penghlis) as his father. Madeline then blackmails Liesl threatening to expose Nathan's true paternity unless she agrees to testify on Nina's behalf to keep her out of prison. Madeline is used as a diversion when Ava and several others prisoners escape. In June 2015, Madeline is still in prison due to the belief that she was involved in the previous prison break. It is revealed that she is conspiring with attorney Ric Lansing (Rick Hearst) to get released and gain access to the family's money. After Ric's unsuccessful attempt to double cross Madeline by revealing that he has married Nina, Madeline orders him to secure her release. Upon her release, Madeline claims that she no longer cares about the money and hides the fact that Ric is working for her. Madeleine and Ric begin sleeping together as he succeeds in obtaining Nina's power of attorney, and tricking her into getting herself committed by leading her to believe she kidnapped Ava's daughter again. Meanwhile, Madeline clashes with Nathan's girlfriend Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms). On August 31, Madeline is revealed to be Silas' killer and Ric tricks her into confessing when he wears a wire. Madeline is devastated to learn Nathan is behind her arrest and tries to sway Nina to her side in a last ditch effort to save herself. Nina disowns Madeline for her greed and tells her she hates her as she is sent off to prison. However, Madeline warns Nina that she will return. Development =Casting and creation= It was initially rumored that Shirley Jones would play the mystery role but Jones's appearance on the series turned out to be a bit role. On January 17, 2014, executive producer Frank Valentini teased \\"major casting news\\" on Twitter. Shortly after, Entertainment Weekly exclusively confirmed that Donna Mills known for her legendary role as Abby Cunningham on Knots Landing had joined the cast of General Hospital in a mystery role. Mills first airdate was slated for late February 2014. Mills later revealed that Valentini had asked her to keep the details of her character private. On February 25, Mills announced her first airdate on Twitter. Valentini told Soaps In Depth that the show's head writer Ron Carlivati suggested Mills specifically. \\"I am thrilled out of my mind\\" Carlivati said of the casting decision. The writer admitted that it was just wishful thinking on his part and Valentini told him he'd look into it. Valentini and Carlivati contacted Mills' agent and offered her the role. Though she was flattered to have been handpicked for the role, Mills was hesitant to take the job. She revealed that she had been approached by CBS Daytime drama The Young and the Restless years earlier but turned down the role because she felt the timing was off. Mills wanted to speak with them directly about the character. \\"And if Donna Mills says, 'Let's get on the phone,' you get on the phone\\" Valentini said.\\" Thanks to the phone conversation, Mills agreed to the role. She said \\"they really did a sell job on me!\\" Mills explained, \\"They got on the phone and they did their magic. It sounded like it would be fun.\\" Valentini stressed that only Mills could play the part so she agreed despite not knowing much about the character. Mills spoke with her former Knots Landing co-stars Ted Shackelford and Joan Van Ark about their experiences in daytime. Mills also admitted \\"I could do GH now because my daughter is in college.\\" The actress later said \\"I'm missing my daughter terribly, so it really helps to have GH to keep my mind busy.\\" The job brought Mills back to her roots. Mills started out acting in the 1960s in the daytime soaps, The Secret Storm and Love Is a Many Splendored Thing. Mills was also reunited with her former Splendored Thing co-star Leslie Charleson who joined the soap in 1977 as Monica Quartermaine. Ironically, legendary GH producer Gloria Monty had cast Mills in the role of \\"Rocket\\" on The Secret Storm. In an interview featured in Nelson Branco's Soap Opera Uncensored, Mills explained that she was initially contracted to do 12 episodes but she was definitely open to the possibility of doing more. However, head writer Ron Carlivati said \\"she can stay as long as she wants.\\" \\"It's not a way that I'm used to working\\" Mills said of her experience on set. \\"There's no time for anything. You just do it and it's done\\" she said of the rapid production style. Mills compared the experience to her prime time work and said \\"GH is like a runaway train! They do nine episodes a week! On Knots we shot, oh, maybe 10 pages a day at most -- and that was a really heavy day for us. On GH, they're shooting 150 a day, every day. To tell you the truth, I'm kind of in shock.\\" During a television interview with ABC 7 News, Mills expressed her disdain for the rapid pace. \\"I hate the pace! Are you kidding me? Who would like this? No, it's terrible! You have no chance to rehearse and feel it.\\" Mills revealed to Soaps In Depth that the quick pacing made it difficult for her but the show had agreed to accommodate her by allowing her to work a certain number of days and film a certain number of scenes whenever she returned. It made it easier for her to say yes to the returns. After she finished her second arc, Mills said the work had become more manageable because she had gotten rid of her nerves and \\"I am a little more familiar with it... I know how to pace myself a little better.\\" In May 2015 Mills said of her multiple returns, \\"When you play a fun character like this, you get hooked.\\" =Characterization= Ron Carlivati crafted the role of Madeline specifically with Mills in mind. \\"Knots is my favorite TV show ever and growing up, I was obsessed with Donna. Still am!\\" Carlivati revealed to TV Guide. The writer explained that when he first envisioned Madeline, \\"it suddenly came to me: 'Oh, my God, she's Abby Ewing!\\" Carlivati described the character of Madeline as \\"a glamorous, high-powered bitch on wheels.\\" Mills said \\"She's very complicated. Very screwed up.\\" Mills said that there was a reason that her husband left her without money. According to Mills's interview with Soap Opera Digest, Madeline is \\"very Upper East Side of New York City.\\" Mills described Madeline as being very \\"social, sophisticated, powerful and smart.\\" Rosemary Rossi described Madeline as \\"selfish, spoiled, rude and belittling\\" and categorized her as an \\"acid-tongued\\" \\"she-devil.\\" According to Mills, Madeline usually keeps her emotions to herself but she has a soft spot for certain people. Michael Logan described Madeline as \\"yet another ritzy firestarter\\" when compared to Abby. Upon her return in October 2014, Mills explained that \\"She's going to have more than one side.\\" The actress continued, \\"I think she's got a really bad side.\\" Madeline is \\"kind of blind\\" to her misdeeds. It's not really a huge deal to her. When comparing her two characters, Mills noted that the biggest difference is that Abby was a good mother and \\"with Madeline, not so much.\\" =Introduction (2014)= On March 10, 2014, ABC Daytime released a short promotional package for the character. On March 14, 2014, Mills made her debut as the mother of estranged mother-in- law of Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton), on a \\"mission to get Silas to give up that inheritance.\\" Madeline has always believed Silas married her now comatose daughter Nina for money. As far as Madeline is concerned, \\"he wanted a scholarship fund.\\" But now that he's found success as a doctor, Madeline figures he doesn't need the money. Madeline is also revealed to be the mother of Nathan West (Ryan Paevey). According to Mills, Madeline is \\"kind of paranoid\\" because her husband died leaving her (and Nathan) with nothing‚Äîeverything belonged to the comatose Nina. Though she is proud of her son for trying to avenge Nina and pin prove Silas poisoned Nina, she looks down on him becoming a cop to do so. \\"Madeline considers police work a very lowly, undignified profession\\" Mills explained. \\"It's so beneath her stature!\\" Madeline only shows her vulnerability with Nathan. \\"There's a real soft spot in her heart for him\\" Mills explained. During a podcast interview with On-Air On-Soaps shortly after her debut, Mills hinted at several other major twists in the story. As previously rumored, it is revealed that Madeline was responsible for her daughter's coma. She administered the drugs to kill Nina's unborn child to keep said child (and Silas) from inheriting the family's money. Madeline then kills the pharmacist to cover her tracks only to be caught and arrested by Nathan himself. On the April 9 episode, Madeline is revealed to be the long lost sister of the treacherous Dr. Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati). Born Magda Westbourne in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, she leaves home with bigger and better dreams. She ditches her accent, changes her name to Madeline West and marries a wealthy man. It is also revealed that Nathan is actually Liesl's biological son. According to Mills, \\"Madeline never liked Liesl much\\" and doesn't think she would have been a good mother to Nathan. As she is extradited back to New York to stand trial, Madeline \\"drops a bombshell on [Nathan] that's life altering.\\" As Madeline is written out on May 1, she informs Nathan that Nina is alive. Michelle Stafford then made a surprise appearance as a very much alive Nina. = Return (2014‚Äì2015) = During Madeline's first stint with the series, Ron Carlivati revealed that the writers had already planned out the character's return arc and were just waiting for Mills to jump on board. About a month after wrapping her first stint, Mills confirmed to Soaps In Depth that her return was definitely going to happen. In July 2014, it was officially announced that Mills would return. In August 2014, Frank Valentini said \\"We're still working on the dates and the deals\\" but Madeline would definitely factor into Nina's storyline. Mills made her onscreen return in October 2014 as Madeline tries to get into her daughter Nina's good graces. Mills appreciated that the character had some more layers. Though her scheming does more harm to her children then good there is \\"a love for\\" them Mills insisted. Madeline is \\"afraid\\" of an unhinged Nina and is aware that she is unstable. Also, Madeline's concerns about \\"being broke\\" are what drives her to do certain unspeakable things. In exchange for access to the family's money, Madeline agrees to help Nina kidnap the newborn baby of Ava Jerome (Maura West) -- Silas's former mistress. However, she gets arrested only after Nina attacks her and leaves her for dead. Mills later revealed that she'd be sharing scenes with Maura West when both Madeline and Ava landed in prison in January 2015. During the confrontation, Madeline expresses her delight at seeing Ava finally paying for destroying Nina's life so many years ago. When Ava points out that her scheming has landed her in prison as well, Madeline shrugs it off assuming a judge will believe that she was truly scared for her life when she agreed to help Nina. Mills is last seen on January 29, 2015, as Madeline tries to avoid getting shot when Ava and several other prisoners escape from prison. In an interview with Soaps In Depth, Mills confirmed that she would reprise the role of Madeline again and would start filming on April 27, the day after the 42nd Daytime Emmy Awards. She expected to start airing sometime in late May. In an interview featured in a June 2015 issue of Soap Opera Digest, Mills looked forward to working opposite Rick Hearst who played Madeline's new son-in-law Ric Lansing. However, the actress admitted that she did not how long the return would last. On August 31, 2015, Madeline is revealed to be the killer of Silas Clay. Mills revealed that the producers had filmed several scenarios for Silas's murder to maintain the mystery. At the time, Mills herself was not aware that Michael Easton was leaving the show. The hiring of head writing team Jean Passanante and Shelly Altman left Mills uncertain of a future return to the series. The September 28 edition of Soaps In Depth confirmed that Mills had wrapped up her latest stint with the series despite Madeline's promise of a return. =Return (2018)= In August 2018, Entertainment Weekly reported that Mills will be reprising her role as Madeline. Mills made her return on August 17, 2018. Reception The casting announcement was immediately praised from critics. \\"Praise, Soap Jesus!\\" Jamey Giddens said of the casting announcement. \\"I can't breathe. General Hospital has cast the mother of all prime time soap superbitches,\\" Giddens continued. \\"If GH hadn't already been Must See Suds, it definitely is now!\\" Giddens exclaimed. Michael Fairman described the announcement as an \\"awesome casting bombshell.\\" Soap Opera Network's Kambra Clifford said ever since the announcement, \\"tongues have been wagging regarding character details and a first airdate.\\" On-Air On-Soaps praised the promo of Mills's debut and said \\"Now this is a promo apropos for the occasion!\\" \\"There Goes The Cul-De- Sac\\" said Daytime Confidential of the promo's release. Jamey Giddens said, \\"Power players in Port Charles, New York are about to be judged on the Abby [Cunningham] scale!\\" Giddens, who was a big fan of the actress gushed over Mills debut and said, \\"I have waited my entire life for this.\\" ABC Soaps In Depth listed Madeline at #2 in the \\"5 Things We're Loving\\" section and said \\"Knot Landing vet Donna Mills has still got it!\\" On-Air On-Soaps praised Mills' portrayal of Madeline. \\"She can play steely conniving witch like no other!\\" Mills' casting along with several other high-profile castings led to Soap Opera Digest giving the soap the award for \\"Best Casting Coups\\" in 2014. Soap Opera Digest listed Mills as \\"performer of the week\\" for her portrayal of Madeline during the prison scenes. The magazine said sight of Mills in an orange jumpsuit was \\"positively priceless\\" and said Madeline's prison stint was as \\"glamorous\\" as Susan Lucci prison storyline as Erica Kane on All My Children. \\"Mills knew just how much scenery to chew to deliver a performance that was just as funny as it was menacing\\" the magazine raved. Greg Hernandez said \\"It's been a real treat to have Miss Mills back on television in a juicy soap role.\\" Mills received her very first Emmy nomination in the Outstanding Special Guest Performer in a Drama Series category for her portrayal of Madeline. Mills revealed that the nomination was a happy surprise because she was not aware that the show had submitted her. Mills won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Guest Performer in a Drama Series at the 42nd Daytime Emmy Awards in 2015. She tied with Ray Wise of The Young and the Restless and Fred Willard from The Bold and the Beautiful.
