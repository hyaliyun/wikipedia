The Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF O√ñ) founded the ‚ÄúLight of Peace from Bethlehem‚Äù as a new Christmas tradition in 1986, more than 30 years ago. The State of Upper Austria has supported the Light of Peace from the very beginning. It shines each year all over Europe, in the United States and even in some countries in South America. In recent years, it has also been handed over to many political and religious leaders as well as international organisations. For the last 30 years, the light has served as a reminder of the message of Christmas on the Nativity of Christ in Bethlehem, and thus of the deeper meaning of Christmas, mainly peace. Every November, a specially selected child travels to Bethlehem with hundreds of participants of the ‚ÄúFriedenslichtreise‚Äù (journey of the Light of Peace). A delegation led by the Governor of Upper Austria Thomas Stelzer also accompanies this trip. This child receives the light in a lantern from the Birth Grotto in Bethlehem. Austrian Airlines then brings the Light of Peace in a special oil lamp to Austria. in a special oil lamp. There, it is passed from person to person on Christmas Eve. With the help of several organisations, such as the Scouts, the Red Cross or the Austrian fire brigade, the light is distributed from Upper Austria throughout Europe and the world. The Light of Peace travels several kilometres until it reaches its destination. Upper Austria's Governor Thomas Stelzer personally leads the delegation to deliver the Light of Peace from Bethlehem via Linz to Brussels, the European Capital City. Traditionally, it is handed over to the President of the European Commission as well as to the political leaders from all EU countries in a Christmas Ceremony. In 2018 the light was also officially brought to the Royal Family in Belgium for the first time. Historically, the light has been a symbol of peace on several occasions. In 1989, the light was welcomed by 10,000 people on the main square of the south Bohemian city ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice as a symbol of the new neighbourhood and solidarity. In addition, it shone at the opening of the Berlin Wall. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, an Upper Austrian delegation brought it to the new neighbours in Berlin and Thuringia in Germany. The Light of Peace was also presented at Ground Zero in New York and to UN soldiers at the Golan Heights. The Light of Peace is meant to be a call to everyone to stand up for peace and therefore consciously pass on the light. During a private audience, Pope Benedict XVI called it a ‚Äúsymbol of hearts‚Äù.  Conscious symbol of peace in Europe and the world  The ‚ÄúORF Light of Peace from Bethlehem‚Äù reached out to many celebrities as a Christmas greeting in the past few years. These include, for example: ¬∑ Former President of the European Commission Romano Prodi ¬∑ Former President of the European Commission Jos√© Manuel Barroso ¬∑ Former President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker ¬∑ President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen ¬∑ Pope Benedikt XVI. ¬∑ Pope Francis ¬∑ Pope Paul VI ¬∑ Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl ¬∑ Chancellor Angela Merkel ¬∑ Former President Michail Gorbatschow ¬∑ Former President Vaclav Havel ¬∑ King Hussein of Jordan ¬∑ Princess Astrid and Prince Laurent of Belgium ¬∑ Archbishop Cardinal Franz K√∂nig ¬∑ Archbishop Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂nborn  ‚ÄûLight of peace‚Äú international  = Austria = On the third Sunday in Advent, the Light of Peace is passed on to scout delegations from several nations across Europe. This event happens annually in Vienna. In Austria itself, it will be distributed on December 24th in local studios of the Austrian Broadcasting Coporation (ORF), at many train stations, Red Cross and Samaritan Federation offices, churches, fire departments, by the scouts and in Fire-departments. Since Austria joined the European Union (1995), Austrian MEP Paul R√ºbig has brought this tradition to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The Light of peace is also presented to the Federal President of Austria year after year. So far: ¬∑ Thomas Klestil ¬∑ Heinz Fischer ¬∑ Alexander van der Bellen = Germany = In Germany, the campaign is organized by some Boy Scout Associations (Bund der Pfadfinderinnen und Pfadfinder, Deutsche Pfadfinderschaft Sankt Georg, Pfadfinderinnenschaft St. Georg, Verband Christlicher Pfadfinderinnen und Pfadfinder and Verband Deutscher Altpfadfindergilden) The light is picked up by train from Vienna and then distributed in over 100 cities across Germany. = Switzerland = In Switzerland, the registered association Friedenslicht Schweiz, which is active all around the year round, is responsible for distributing. There is also a particularly active, dedicated scout group called Friedenslicht Schweiz. = Italy = For the South Tyrolean towns, the Light of Peace is regularly handed over to the South Tyrolean boy scouts on December 23 in the parish church on the Brenner by scouts from Innsbruck and Zirl in Austria. The light for the rest of Italy has been picked up by Italian scouts in Vienna since 1988. = France = Since 2003, the Light of Peace in France has been brought to Paris every year by the Scouts et Guides de France and √âclaireuses et √âclaireurs Unionistes de France and from there distributed throughout France. = Poland = Before Poland joined the European Union, the Light of Peace was taken over by the Polish Scout Association (ZHP). Since then, the delegations from Slovakia and Poland have alternately taken over the light. When the Slovaks pick up the light, they bring it to the Slovak-Polish border ≈Åysa Polana = Slovakia = For Slovakia, scouts take over the light in Vienna and distribute it throughout the country. The Light of Peace has also been lit in the observatory on Lomnitz peak since 2003. = Canada = In Canada, Austrian and Canadian scouts first brought the light to Ottawa in 2009, where it was spread across the country. = Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia = The light distributed in Poland is also passed on to neighboring countries in the east, specifically to Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.

Although tachyonic particles (particles that move faster than light) are a purely hypothetical concept that violate a number of essential physical principles, at least one field with imaginary mass, the Higgs field, is believed to exist. In general, tachyonic fields play an important role in physics and are discussed in popular books. Under no circumstances do any excitations of tachyonic fields ever propagate faster than light‚Äîthe presence or absence of a tachyonic (imaginary) mass has no effect on the maximum velocity of signals, and so unlike faster-than-light particles there is no violation of causality. The term \\"tachyon\\" was coined by Gerald Feinberg in a 1967 paper that studied quantum fields with imaginary mass. Feinberg believed such fields permitted faster than light propagation, but it was soon realized that this was not the case. Instead, the imaginary mass creates an instability in the configuration: any configuration in which one or more field excitations are tachyonic will spontaneously decay, and the resulting configuration contains no physical tachyons. This process is known as tachyon condensation. A famous example is the condensation of the Higgs boson in the Standard Model of particle physics. In modern physics, all fundamental particles are regarded as localized excitations of fields. Tachyons are unusual because the instability prevents any such localized excitations from existing. Any localized perturbation, no matter how small, starts an exponentially growing cascade that strongly affects physics everywhere inside the future light cone of the perturbation. Interpretation = Overview of tachyonic condensation= Although the notion of a tachyonic imaginary mass might seem troubling because there is no classical interpretation of an imaginary mass, the mass is not quantized. Rather, the scalar field is; even for tachyonic quantum fields, the field operators at spacelike separated points still commute (or anticommute), thus preserving causality. Therefore, information still does not propagate faster than light, and solutions grow exponentially, but not superluminally (there is no violation of causality). The \\"imaginary mass\\" really means that the system becomes unstable. The zero value field is at a local maximum rather than a local minimum of its potential energy, much like a ball at the top of a hill. A very small impulse (which will always happen due to quantum fluctuations) will lead the field to roll down with exponentially increasing amplitudes toward the local minimum. In this way, tachyon condensation drives a physical system that has reached a local limit and might naively be expected to produce physical tachyons, to an alternative stable state where no physical tachyons exist. Once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential, its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather are ordinary particles with a positive mass-squared, such as the Higgs boson. = Physical interpretation of a tachyonic field and signal propagation= There is a simple mechanical analogy that illustrates that tachyonic fields do not propagate faster than light, why they represent instabilities, and helps explain the meaning of imaginary mass (the mass squared being negative). Consider a long line of pendulums, all pointing straight down. The mass on the end of each pendulum is connected to the masses of its two neighbors by springs. Wiggling one of the pendulums will create two ripples that propagate in both directions down the line. As the ripple passes, each pendulum in its turn oscillates a few times about the straight down position. The speed of propagation of these ripples is determined in a simple way by the tension of the springs and the inertial mass of the pendulum weights. Formally, these parameters can be chosen so that the propagation speed is the speed of light. In the limit of an infinite density of closely spaced pendulums, this model becomes identical to a relativistic field theory, where the ripples are the analog of particles. Displacing the pendulums from pointing straight down requires positive energy, which indicates that the squared mass of those particles is positive. Now consider an initial condition where at time t=0, all the pendulums are pointing straight up. Clearly this is unstable, but at least in classical physics one can imagine that they are so carefully balanced they will remain pointing straight up indefinitely so long as they are not perturbed. Wiggling one of the upside-down pendulums will have a very different effect from before. The speed of propagation of the effects of the wiggle is identical to what it was before, since neither the spring tension nor the inertial mass have changed. However, the effects on the pendulums affected by the perturbation are dramatically different. Those pendulums that feel the effects of the perturbation will begin to topple over, and will pick up speed exponentially. Indeed, it is easy to show that any localized perturbation kicks off an exponentially growing instability that affects everything within its future \\"ripple cone\\" (a region of size equal to time multiplied by the ripple propagation speed). In the limit of infinite pendulum density, this model is a tachyonic field theory.  Importance in physics  The phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking, which is closely related to tachyon condensation, plays a central part in many aspects of theoretical physics, including the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau and BCS theories of superconductivity. Other examples include the inflaton field in certain models of cosmic inflation (such as new inflation), and the tachyon of bosonic string theory.J. Polchinski, String Theory, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK (1998)NOVA, \\"The Elegant Universe\\", PBS television special, https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/  Condensation  In quantum field theory, a tachyon is a quantum of a field‚Äîusually a scalar field‚Äîwhose squared mass is negative, and is used to describe spontaneous symmetry breaking: The existence of such a field implies the instability of the field vacuum; the field is at a local maximum rather than a local minimum of its potential energy, much like a ball at the top of a hill. A very small impulse (which will always happen due to quantum fluctuations) will lead the field (ball) to roll down with exponentially increasing amplitudes: it will induce tachyon condensation. Once the tachyonic field reaches the minimum of the potential, its quanta are not tachyons any more but rather have a positive mass-squared. The Higgs boson of the standard model of particle physics is an example. Technically, the squared mass is the second derivative of the effective potential. For a tachyonic field the second derivative is negative, meaning that the effective potential is at a local maximum rather than a local minimum. Therefore, this situation is unstable and the field will roll down the potential. Because a tachyon's squared mass is negative, it formally has an imaginary mass. This is a special case of the general rule, where unstable massive particles are formally described as having a complex mass, with the real part being their mass in usual sense, and the imaginary part being the decay rate in natural units. However, in quantum field theory, a particle (a \\"one-particle state\\") is roughly defined as a state which is constant over time; i.e., an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian. An unstable particle is a state which is only approximately constant over time; If it exists long enough to be measured, it can be formally described as having a complex mass, with the real part of the mass greater than its imaginary part. If both parts are of the same magnitude, this is interpreted as a resonance appearing in a scattering process rather than particle, as it is considered not to exist long enough to be measured independently of the scattering process. In the case of a tachyon the real part of the mass is zero, and hence no concept of a particle can be attributed to it. Even for tachyonic quantum fields, the field operators at space-like separated points still commute (or anticommute), thus preserving the principle of causality. For closely related reasons, the maximum velocity of signals sent with a tachyonic field is strictly bounded from above by the speed of light. Therefore, information never moves faster than light regardless of the presence or absence of tachyonic fields. Examples for tachyonic fields are all cases of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In condensed matter physics a notable example is ferromagnetism; in particle physics the best known example is the Higgs mechanism in the standard model.  Tachyons in string theory  In string theory, tachyons have the same interpretation as in quantum field theory. However, string theory can, at least, in principle, not only describe the physics of tachyonic fields, but also predict whether such fields appear. Tachyonic fields indeed arise in many versions of string theory. In general, string theory states that what we see as \\"particles\\" (electrons, photons, gravitons and so forth) are actually different vibrational states of the same underlying string. The mass of the particle can be deduced from the vibrations which the string exhibits; roughly speaking, the mass depends upon the \\"note\\" which the string sounds. Tachyons frequently appear in the spectrum of permissible string states, in the sense that some states have negative mass-squared, and therefore, imaginary mass. If the tachyon appears as a vibrational mode of an open string, this signals an instability of the underlying D-brane system to which the string is attached. The system will then decay to a state of closed strings and/or stable D-branes. If the tachyon is a closed string vibrational mode, this indicates an instability in spacetime itself. Generally, it is not known (or theorized) what this system will decay to. However, if the closed string tachyon is localized around a spacetime singularity, the endpoint of the decay process will often have the singularity resolved.

They are native to Goa, unlike recent Muslim migrants from Karnataka. They are commonly referred as Moir () by Goan Catholics and Hindus. Moir is derived from the Portuguese word mour (Moors). The Portuguese called them Mouros because they (and the Spaniards in contact with the Muslims of Mauritania, who had conquered the Iberian Peninsula) were called Mouros and later generalized as Mouros. History Although the advent of Muslims in Goa occurred later in history, Arab geographers referred to Goa as Sindabur and believed that Goa had one of the best ports in western India. In 554 CE, Sidi Ali Kodupon wrote the Turkish-language book Mohit. In the book, Goa is referred to as Kuvah-Sindabur: a combination of the names Kuvah (Goa) and Sindabur (Chandor). The copper plate of Kadamba Jayakesi I refers to the Muslim Minister named Chadma. While Kadamba ruler Gullhadeva I was sailing towards Somanath, his ship got involved in a naval accident and the mast of his ship broke. His grandson Jayakesi I gave Chadma, the privilege of levying the taxes on small and big boats. The amount collected by way of taxes was utilized for the maintenance of the mosques built in Goa at Laghumorambika (modern Merces). This copper plate goes to the extent of saying that Jayakesi I made him the Chief Minister. Later Arab Muslim commercial traders migrated to Goa by force of conquest and established their society; this was the first influx of Muslims into Goa, which led some local Hindus to migrate elsewhere. After Malik Kafur invasion and subsequently during the rule of Sultanate, there were Muslim Officers in Goa like Malik Bahadur. After the downfall of the Goa Kadamba, some Muslims might have migrated to Bhatkal and Honavar. The Nawayaths of Bhatkal are the descendant of Muslim community and once lived in Goa. The Delhi Sultanate took over Goa in 1312, destroying the city of Govapuri and demolishing shrines. In turn, they were forced to surrender Goa by 1370 to Harihara I of Vijayanagara. The Vijayanagara monarchs ruled Goa for the next hundred years (until 1469), before it passed to the Bahmani sultans of Gulbarga. After the Bahmani Sultanate collapsed the Adil Shahis of Bijapur took over, making Velha Goa their ancillary capital. During this era, Muslim pilgrims from all over India embarked on their journey to Mecca from Goa. Thus by this time Muslim community evolved in Goa as a combination conversions and intermarriage with local converts. A permanent settlement was established by the Portuguese in 1510 in Velha Goa (Old Goa), when the Portuguese admiral Afonso de Albuquerque defeated the ruling Bijapur king Yusuf Adil Shah. Efforts to suppress Islam were made by the Portuguese. From 1540 onwards, Goa Inquisition was established. The Muslims were persecuted and forced to convert to Catholicism, killed or exiled. Most mosques were destroyed and churches were built on them. The inquisitor's one of the first act was to forbid any open practice of the Islam on pain of death. Most of the Goa Inquisition's records were destroyed after its abolition in 1812, and it is thus impossible to know the exact number of those put on trial and the punishments they were prescribed. From 1560 to 1774, a total of 16,172 persons were tried and condemned or acquitted by the tribunals of the Inquisition. Demography Muslims are concentrated in Sattari, Bicholim, Sanguem, Ponda and Vasco da Gama. Their language parallels Dakhini of the Deccan Plateau. This dialect of Urdu has heavy Konkani influence and may be considered the \\"Konkani slang\\" of Goan Muslims. Goan Muslims are bilingual (speaking Konkani outside the home); some are educated in Marathi, and they use the Perso-Arabic and Devanagari scripts for written communication. The Muslims constitute nearly 7% of Goa population. Culture The majority of Goan Muslims follow Sunni Islam, the predominant groups being that of Mullas/Mujawars, Sayyids, Shaikhs (Xec in Portuguese), Khans/Pathans, Khojas, Bhatiars (cooks), Bhoras (merchants) and Manyars (bangle-makers). They observe all Muslim holidays and festivals such as Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha and Eid-e-Milad. Goan Muslims as well as people from other religions are governed by a Portuguese Civil code based on the progressive old Portuguese Family Laws; unsuccessful attempts were made for a change to Muslim personal law. Personal law of Hindus and Muslims is not recognized in Goa. Goans have a history of peace and harmony, without religious violence; one exception was a Hindu-Muslim riot on 3‚Äì4 March 2006. Like Goans of other faiths, Goan Muslims' staple foods are rice and fish; sea food is preferred to goat meat, and biryani is a delicacy during festivals like Eid.

He also claimed the Principality of Orange.  Life  coffin of William Hyacinth in the royal crypt at Hadamar William Hyacinth was the son of Prince John Francis Desideratus of Nassau-Siegen and Eleonore Sophie of Baden, his second wife. In 1695, he took up his residence in Siegen. In the same year, the city fell victim to a great fire, which burned 350 buildings, two churches and the Nassau Court, the headquarters of the ruling family. His father began building a new castle in Siegen as the new family home in 1696. From 17 December 1699 to 2 March 1707, William Hyacinth was the ruler of Nassau-Siegen. He was hoping to inherit much more than his father's principality of Nassau-Siegen, since he was one of the nearest male relatives of the childless King William III of England, and thus a potential heir to William's extensive lands in Germany and the Dutch Republic. However, William III left his possessions by will to John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz. William Hyacinth later used the title of Prince of Orange in Brabant. He did not even inherit all of his father's wealth. His father had remarried with Isabella Clara du Puget de la Serre and had had seven surviving children with her. In his will, he left her a bequest of 1100 taler per year. Her two sons each received 500 taler per year and her five daughters 200 taler each. William Hyacinth challenged this will before the Imperial Supreme Court, however, he lost his case in 1702. In the same year William III died in England. William Hyacinth traveled to Paris to secure the support of France with regard to his rights of inheritance. Other claimants were King Frederick I of Prussia and John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz, who was designated as the sole heir in William III's testament. King Louis XIV, however, showed little interest in supporting a Protestant prince without military power base. William Hyacinth then travelled to the principality of Orange and announced there that he had seized the principality. Louis XIV declared that the Prince Henri Jules of Cond√© was the rightful heir to the principality of Orange and occupied it militarily. Henri Jules transferred the principality to France. In the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, the lands of the principality were definitively awarded to France. His lavish court, with which he wanted to underscore his claim to the inheritance of Orange, his journeys and gifts cost far more than his income from the Duchy of Nassau-Siegen could bear. William Hyacinth was consequently indebted to the bankers De Rh√∂n and Schonemann from Frankfurt, pledging of the villages Wilnsdorf and Wilgersdorf for . He increased taxes across the country to intolerable levels. Another source of income were excessive fines, which further damaged his reputation in his country. His quick temper and ambition were feared in their own family. When his brother (and successor) Frederick William Adolf expressed his displeasure, William Hyacinth directed the guns of his castle on his brother's castle in order to demonstrate his power. Frederick William Adolf then sued his brother in the assembly of the Westphalian Circle. When William Hyacinth visited the court in Vienna in 1705, to raise support for his inheritance claim, Siegen was occupied by troops from Nassau and Prussia. The people revolted and plundered and disarmed William Hyacinth's castle. The number of complaints about his conduct continued to increase. On 15 July 1706, Siegen was again occupied, this time by troops from County Palatine of Neuburg and Prussia, at the request of the Aulic Council. William Hyacinth's Chancellor, de Colomba, who had played a major r√¥le in William Hyacinth's tyranny, was arrested and on 20 December 1710 exiled from the German Empire for life. William Hyacinth himself fled to Hadamar, to his cousin Prince Francis Alexander. Heart Epitaph of William Hyacinth in the Herzberg Chapel in Hadamar The revolts against his reign of terror continued. On 29 March 1707 William Hyacinth had Friedrich Flender von der Hardt, a suspected leader of the insurgents, beheaded without any form of trial. Emperor Joseph I used this occasion to deprive William Hyacinth of his principality. It was temporarily administered by two imperial councillors and then passed to Frederick William Adolf. In 1713, France withdrew William Hyacinth's French title of Count of Chalon. William Hyacinth was awarded an annual pension of 4000 talers. The remaining assets were used to pay the pensions of his stepmother and her siblings, his creditors and a debt of honor to the family of Friedrich Flender. William Hyacinth complained to the emperor and to the Diet of Regensburg, however, neither complaint met with success.  Marriages and issue  William Hyacinth was married three times. His first wife was Maria Francisca of F√ºrstenberg-Heiligenberg, whom he married on 9 April 1687 in Li√®ge. She died on 7 June 1691. With her he had three children: * Joseph Hyacinth (1688-1688) * Francis Joseph (1689‚Äì1703) * A daughter (1691‚Äì1692) His second wife was Maria Anna of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg- Schillingsf√ºrst, whom he married on 22 May 1698 in Frankfurt. With her he had one daughter: * Anna Maria Josepha (1704‚Äì1723) Only his third wife survived him. She was Countess Sophia of Starhemberg, whom he married on 28 July 1740 in Vienna. She died on 12 December 1773. This marriage was childless.

It is native to the Pacific coast of the United States.McMurray, Nancy E. 1989. Chrysolepis chrysophylla. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. Distribution and habitat Chrysolepis chrysophylla is endemic to the Pacific coast of the United States, growing from extreme southern Washington through western Oregon, south to west-central California. It grows in climax forests dominated by redwood, white fir, western hemlock, and Shasta red fir, or mixes of tree types. It may be an understory shrub, or it may codominate the canopy as a tree. Habitat types where the tree may be found include coastal forests, woodlands, and chaparral. In the western Cascade Mountains it grows in western hemlock forests. In the southern Cascades it grows at higher elevations but takes on a smaller, shrubbier form. Description Shrubby forms of the plant occur in dry areas, higher elevations, and poor soils. The plant grows into a tree up to tall in cooler, moister areas such as valley bottoms and north- facing slopes, and foggy and rainy areas. The bark is thin and smooth on young trunks; on older specimens it becomes thicker and platy. The open crown of the large tree is conical in shape. The leathery evergreen leaves are dark green on the upper sides and golden underneath. The leaves are folded upward along the midrib. The species is monoecious, with individuals bearing both male and female flowers. White male flowers are borne in the leaf axils, and a cluster of female flowers is borne beneath them. A spiny bur contains one to three nuts. There is generally a burl at the base of the tree. The tree may sprout from adventitious buds in the burl, a form of vegetative reproduction that is more common in dry areas where it is less likely that seedlings would become established. The tree may live up to 500 years.Chrysolepis chrysophylla. Flora of North America. Uses The tree has a heavy, strong wood which is light brown with a pinkish tinge. It rarely grows in large enough quantities to serve commercial purposes. The nut is edible, having a flavor similar to the hazelnut or filbert. They are commonly eaten by squirrels and chipmunks.

The 1979 Herat uprising was an insurrection that took place in and around the city of Herat, Afghanistan in March 1979. It included both a popular uprising and a mutiny of Afghan Army troops against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA). The communist regime at first appealed to its Soviet allies for help, but the Soviet leadership declined to intervene. After the insurgents seized and held the city for about a week, the regime was able to retake it with its own forces, and the subsequent aerial bombardment and recapture of Herat left up to 25,000 of its inhabitants dead.Roy, p.108 The Herat uprising was the worst outbreak of armed violence in the country in 50 years, and was the deadliest incident in the 1978-1979 period before the start of the Soviet occupation. Uprising The events in Herat took place in the wider context of unrest against the socialist reforms implemented by the DRA, of which the principal was agrarian reform. The reforms, besides contradicting tradition and the principles of Islam, in many cases worsened the situation of the rural poor they were supposed to reward. Starting in May 1978 in Nuristan, spontaneous uprisings took place throughout Afghanistan against the DRA and its policies. The agrarian reform had taken place near Herat without opposition, as there was little solidarity between the rural farmers, and the big landowners who mostly lived in the city.Dorronsoro, p.98 In this case the repression carried out by the Khalq against religious dignitaries, including Pir and Ulema, and traditional elites, is cited as a critical factor, as well as the government's literacy campaign, which had become controversial due in particular to the inclusion of communist propaganda in the literacy courses, as well as the practice of mixed-gender classes.Roy, p.93 In Herat Province isolated revolts had already taken place, but the uprising began in earnest on March 15, 1979. In the surrounding districts insurgents gathered around mosques, and following the preaching of their mullahs, marched on the city, where they were joined by many townsmen in attacking government buildings, and symbols of communism. The 17th Division of the Afghan Army was detailed by the regime to put down the rebellion, but this proved a mistake, as there were few Khalqis in that particular unit and instead it mutinied and joined the uprising. A small group of soldiers, officials and Khalq activists withdrew into the city's Blue Mosque. The insurgents held Herat for about a week, during which the city underwent a period of anarchy. Rioters roamed the streets, chanting \\"Allahu Akbar\\", searching for government supporters and sarluchi (those with uncovered heads), indicating a lack of piety;Dorronsoro, p.102 communist officials, in particular teachers, were massacred. The bazaar was looted, and several Soviet advisers to the DRA were killed, though other foreigners were spared. The exact number of Soviets killed during the events is uncertain: certain sources cite high figures of up to 200 but according to official Soviet sources, there were only two victims. Former DRA sources indicate that 3 or 4 Soviets were killed, possibly with their families.Giustozzi,p.212 According to certain sources, the bodies of the dead advisers were paraded around the city by the rebels, but this is denied by other sources.Dorronsoro, p.99 The rebellion did not have a unified leadership: on the military side, the mutineers were led by a group of officers under Sardar Jagran and Rasul Baloch which also included Ismail Khan and Alauddin Khan, who were associated with the Jamiat-e Islami party. Ismail Khan, who later became Amir of Jamiat-e Islami forces in Herat Province and a major Mujahideen commander, did not play a leading role in the revolt, as was later claimed by his supporters.Dorronsoro, p.100 Among the civilian insurgents, the situation was more confused, though some local figures played a significant role: Gul Mohammad, a Barakzai Pashtun from Gozargah, and Kamar-i Dozd and Shir Aga Shongar, two former convicts, led large groups of insurgents. The rebellion overran all the districts around Herat, except Obeh and Pashtun Zarghun where government command posts held out, and spread a few days later to Badghis Province, and then on to other neighbouring provinces. After the initial shock of losing a major city and the defection of a whole division, the DRA reacted ruthlessly. The 4th and 15th armoured brigades were sent from Pul-e-Charki, but due to the distance they had to travel, Hafizullah Amin ordered Major General Sayyed Mukharam, commander of the Kandahar garrison to send an armoured force that could reach Herat faster. Mukharam's column of 30 tanks and 300 men arrived at Herat on March 20, waving green flags and Qurans, which induced the insurgents to believe that rebellion had spread to the whole country. The Khalq troops were thus allowed to pass, and recapture the city. The government forces then subjected Herat to an aerial bombardment with Ilyushin Il-28 bombers flying from Shindand Air Base, during which the city was heavily damaged, and thousands of Heratis were killed, though the exact death toll is uncertain: the lowest estimate runs at 3,000 to 4,000 dead, while the higher-case estimate reaches 25,000 dead.Roy, p.108 In 1992, a mass grave was uncovered, containing 2,000 bodies of those killed by the DRA repression.Dorronsoro, p.101 Consequences The events in Herat caused the Soviet leadership to realize that their Afghan allies were in crisis. Repeated demands from Nur Muhammad Taraki, president of the DRA, for Soviet military assistance in quelling the revolt, prompted a series of secret Politburo meetings. One such meeting took place on March 17, during which Foreign Minister Gromyko acknowledged that the DRA faced \\"thousands\\" of insurgents, but, in accordance with the Brezhnev Doctrine, asserted the \\"fundamental proposition\\" that \\"under no circumstances may we lose Afghanistan\\". Another Politburo member, Alexei Kosygin, expressed distrust of the DRA leadership, stating that \\"Amin and Taraki alike are concealing the true state of affairs from us\\". In a telephone conversation with Kosygin the following day, Taraki complained that he could no longer rely on the Afghan armed forces, even those trained in the Soviet Union, and his pleas for help became even more pressing: he requested that Soviet soldiers from the Soviet republics in Central Asia (many of which were inhabited by the same ethnic groups also found in Afghanistan) could be smuggled into Afghanistan in Afghan garb. However these requests were to no avail, and the Politburo initially moved towards a policy of non-intervention, which was later validated by Brezhnev. When Taraki visited Moscow on March 20, Kosygin explained to him the Soviet policy regarding Afghanistan: However, the Soviets did increase their military assistance in the following months by sending large quantities of equipment, including T-62 tanks, MiG-21 fighters and Mi-24 attack helicopters, along with extra advisers to service them.Urban, pp.31‚Äì32 Despite this, the situation of the Afghan armed forces continued to deteriorate, with mutinies occurring in Jalalabad, Asmar, Ghazni, Nahrin, and in August 1979, the Bala Hissar uprising on a fortress in Kabul. Though these were all put down, the weakness of the military contributed significantly to the spread of the insurgency. On December 24, 1979, under Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet Union deployed the 40th Army,\\"Timeline: Soviet war in Afghanistan\\". BBC News. Published February 17, 2009. commencing the start of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. Interpretations The DRA attempted to present the uprising as having been organised by Iran, occurring a month after the Iranian Revolution. Relations between Khomeini's Iran and the socialist DRA were tense, and the Khalq leadership suspected collusion between the Iranian Ayatollahs and the Shiite communities of Herat, which made up half of the city's population. In a propaganda move, the regime took advantage of the return of 4,000 Afghan labourers from Iran, to claim that Herat had been infiltrated by Iranians dressed as Afghans. As a manifestation of the social and political forces at work in Afghanistan, the Herat uprising was the subject of academic research, which has offered contradictory explanations for it. Giorgio Vercellin presented the uprising as an anti-Pashtun movement, driven by the resentment of Persian-speaking communities against Pashtun settlers. This version is rejected both by Olivier Roy and by Gilles Dorronsoro, the latter pointing out that certain figures of the uprising such as Gul Muhammad, were ethnic Pashtuns, and that the revolt took hold equally in Pashtun-inhabited areas. According to Olivier Roy, the Herat rebellion was an example of an organized rebellion, as opposed to the spontaneous anti-government revolts which occurred elsewhere in the country. Roy considers that the events in Herat bear the hallmark of strategy developed by Burhanuddin Rabbani, the leader of the Islamist party Jamiat-e Islami, consisting of a military coup by supporters infiltrated in the Army, supported by a popular uprising. To support this thesis, Roy points to the actions of Jamiat agents in the military (Ismail Khan and Alauddin Khan), and to links between Jamiat and the mawlawi who preached to the insurgents. Dorronsoro contested this interpretation, based on the relatively minor role played by Jamiat agents. While Jamiat office in Mashhad had opened communications with officers of the 17th Division several weeks before the events, the actual leaders of the mutiny were not aligned with that party (according to Dorronsoro, one of the two main ringleaders was a Maoist). In addition, the lack of coordination between the military and civilian insurgents, and the generally chaotic and unpredictable nature of the uprising indicate, in his view, that it was spontaneous rather than premeditated.

When Teyler deceased in 1778, he was without children or direct family, and specified in his testament how his money was to be spent. He left money for several individuals, the church and the general benefit as described above. Claims have been made by alleged family members that the testament was supposed to be limited in time to 100 years, after which the remaining money were to be transferred to the Teylers family. No claims of such have been recognized in court. The Stichting was founded by five friends of Teylers, who were his executors and the first directors. The first replacing director (board member) of the Teylers Stichting was Adriaan van Zeebergh, the pensionaris of the city of Haarlem, a powerful civil servant position at the time. He replaced Barnaart, who died in 1780.  Governance and field of work  The foundation is governed by five directors, which are appointed via Co-option. The first directors were five of Teylers friends: * Jacobus Barnaart (1778-1780) (In 1780 replaced by Adriaan van Zeebergh (1780-1824)) * Isaac Brand (1778-1782) * Gerard Hugaart (1778-1791) * Antoni Kuits (1778-1789) * Willem van der Vlugt Sr. (1778-1807) The directors traditionally meet in the \\"Grote Herenkamer\\" (Large Boardroom) at the Teylers Fundatiehuis (English: Foundation House), a room adjacent to the Oval Room of Teylers Museum. The current (2008) directors are: * drs.drs. is a scientific title, comparable with MSc. J.R. Beets- Hehewerth * mr.mr. is a scientific title, comparable with LLM J.J. van Es * mr. J.E. Trip, treasurer * R.A.M. van Voorst van Beest-Gunst, secretary * mr. C.G.A. van Wijk, presiding director The Teylers Stichting was responsible for the Teylers Museum, the Teylers Hofje and two societies: the Teylers Eerste Genootschap (Teylers First Society) which focuses on theological questions and the Teylers Tweede Genootschap (Teylers Second Society) which focuses on scientific questions. The Stichting is also responsible for the Teylers Chair at Leiden University. The actual management of the museum was left to a kastelein and later the museum director (not to confuse with the directors of the foundation). In 1981 the governance of the Museum was transferred to a separate foundation on the request of the government, so that they could help fund it through subsidies after its recognition as museum of national importance.Description how the Teylers Museum is organized on the website of Teylerse Museum This separate foundation became the Stichting tot Beheer en Instandhouding van Teylers Museum (Foundation for management and conservation of Teylers Museum), and the Teylers Stichting still appoints two of the six members of the Supervisory Board of that foundation. The Teylers Stichting still does own the actual buildings. As determined in the testament as well, the Stichting is established in the Fundatiehuis.  Archive  The complete archive of the Teylers Stichting is still intact and available. The early years (1778‚Äì1827/1828) in the archive have been digitized and are available online on the website of the Teylers Museum.Description of Teylers Stichting archive on website Teylers Museum This includes the minutes of the directors' meetings and the receipts of materials and museum pieces that were bought. From these receipts it can be reconstructed what the activities of the Teylers Stichting have been in the past. The archive has been stored in a special room in the Fundatiehuis, as specified in the testament, which was provided with a special lock with five keyholes. Each of the directors would get one of the five different keys, and the lock was designed in such a way that it could not be opened or closed without at least three of the five keys - irrespective which.

Defence The defence turned largely on the fact that similar works had been pre-existent and seen by the defendants before the creation of the image at issue. Some of these images pre-dated the work the claimant had created; some did not. The defence also drew attention to differences between the images. Judgment Judge Birss QC, found for the claimant, as he found \\"the defendants' work does reproduce a substantial part of the claimant's artistic work.\\"Judgment Birss held that, while some aspects of the claimants' work were absent from the offending image, sufficient aspects were present to constitute copyright infringement, conversely he held that the claimant's submission of what would constitute an infringing work was over-broad saying \\"I am sure there are many things satisfying the claimant's definition which would not infringe.\\" Birss held that defence argument of prior works was irrelevant, since there was on the one hand no claim that the claimants work was influenced by these works, and on the other hand, there was a causal link between the defendants' desire to use an image like the claimant's image and the production of the offending image, that was not disturbed by the search for similar images.

They organized concerts, staged readings and released a single and a newspaper that deals with forms and possibilities of artistic (musical) intervention in politics (including contributions from: Anarchist Academy, Attila the Stockbroker, F.W.

The band played instrumental music that was influenced by dub and electronica, but also by the 'D√ºsseldorf Schools' of the 1970s (Kraftwerk, NEU!, la D√ºsseldorf) and the early 80s (new wave, Neue Deutsche Welle, Ratinger Hof). Their first album Riva was released in the summer of 1994 on the French label A Contresens. While half of the pieces on Riva featured (spoken) lyrics, its successor, recorded in the spring of 1995 at Matthias Arfmanns studio in Hamburg, was purely instrumental. The seven-song untitled mini-album was released by the Cologne label Finlayson. With this record, Kreidler were compared in the press to the Chicago post-rock school based around Tortoise on one hand, and on the other hand a suggested revival of Krautrock. This was due to their combination of analog and digital instruments and sounds‚Äìconsidered remarkable at the time ‚Äì and the fact that, live, the band construct their pieces around variable patterns and vary them. More clearly rooted in each of these worlds were the side projects of the individual members: since 1996, Reihse and at times Klein had been working with Kraftwerk, NEU!, La D√ºsseldorf mastermind Klaus Dinger in the formation la!NEU?, while Schneider explored the possibilities of Post Rock with To Rococo Rot. Kreidler's next release, the single Kooka√Ø, was a surprisingly melodic song, which reminded Spex magazine of \\"night rides through downtown Dusseldorf and the effect of deserted shopping districts.\\"Oliver Tepel, Spex 1 1995, K√∂ln 1995 =1996= In autumn of 1996, the label KiffSM released the Kreidler album Weekend. With this record they were chosen by the readers of Spex in the 1996 readers' poll as Newcomer of the Year:Leserpoll, Spex 1 1997, K√∂ln 1997 \\"it is particularly the homogeneity of resources, the flexibility of the structures and the development of the album that make 'Weekend' a pleasant weekend in its own right.\\".‚ÄûGerade Homogenit√§t der Mittel, Flexibilit√§t der Strukturen sowie die Entwicklung des Albums an sich machen aus 'Weekend' ein eigenst√§ndiges und angenehmes Wochenende\\" Sascha Henn, intro 11 1996, Osnabr√ºck Die Zeit wrote \\"avant-garde that is fun right away.\\"‚ÄûAvantgarde, die auf Anhieb Spa√ü macht\\", Ulrich Paasch, Die Zeit 42 1996, Hamburg The album also received good reviews internationally. Particularly, other musicians showed their appreciation for the band, among them David Bowie, Arto Lindsay, Momus, Ken Ishi, Pavement, Stereolab, and Nicolette. =1997= In 1997 the success of Weekend led the band on a tour of France and to their first appearances in London. Afterwards they released the EP Fechterin, which was named Single of the Week in the Melody Maker: \\"The three songs are the most precise exercises in exponential electronics I‚Äôve heard since Kraftwerk's Hall of mirrors, and just as danceable\\".Mark Luffmann, Melody Maker, London June 1997 The same month, the EP Resport appeared on the Stewardess label, with remixes by Pyrolator, Erik (MMM), L@n and Robert Lippok. =1998‚Äì1999= Kreidler produced their followup to Weekend in the studio of Mouse on Mars. The album, Appearance and The Park, was released in May 1998. According to interviews of the band one of the main aesthetic ideas of the album was to make it clear that the band members grew up with (Anglo-American) new wave, and not with the German rock music of the 1970s. Even the cover art appears cool, model-like, synthetic, while the 'Park' in the title refers to the park photography of the previous album's cover. The Roland Juno synthesizer can clearly heard as a lead instrument in the tracks, the bass lines are reminiscent of music from the Factory label, sound effects recall post punk and sequencers suggest the Synthpop of the 1980s. The first single, \\"Au Pair\\", combines these elements in an epic pop anthem. The video (directed by Sebastian Kutscher) for the track was awarded second place at the video awards of the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen in 1999. Summer of 1998 saw the release of the EP Coldness, which was the first Kreidler piece with vocals since 1994. Remixes came from Shantel and Daniel Miller, the founder of Mute Records and producer of Depeche Mode, who had met the band at their first appearances in London in 1997. He then mixed them a piece of Synthpop. Forced Exposure in the U.S. wrote: \\"Kreidler's most outlandlishly accessible moment, in a synth-electro style that is totally captivating.\\" Later that year the band went on their first festival tour, including performances in Brighton (The Fringe) and Roskilde. At the end of 1998 Kreidler and Stefan Schneider went their separate ways, with Schneider focussing on his former side-project To Rococo Rot. The band found support on bass in Alex Paulick, the songwriter of Coloma. In the spring of 1999 they toured with this lineup in Great Britain and, with Tarwater, through France and Switzerland. Later that year, Kreidler separated from the record company Play It Again Sam in a (legal) dispute following the departure of their A&R; and Kiffsm label manager Jutta B√§chner. =2000‚Äì2001= In 1999 the band had taken a room in an abandoned post office building behind the central train station in D√ºsseldorf as part of the Innenstadt Mainstream e.V., which also included the project space for electronic music EGO, the artist collective hobbypopMUSEUM, the musicians L@N, Antonelli Electr., The Bad Examples as well as Background Records. In early 2000 they began setting up their studios there for the recording of a new album. The eponymous Kreidler album appeared on Jutta B√§chner's newly founded Wonder label. The music sounded cleaner, more digital, but with a warmth that was clearly different from the model-like coldness of the previous album. The song writing was also more defined, with the pieces on Kreidler featuring clear, pop song-like structures. Three songs featured voice/vocals, one with the British musician Momus and another with Argentinean Leo Garcia: \\"The group's work has never sounded this realized\\" wrote Jason Birchmeier, Allmusic. In February 2001 Kreidler played for the first time in New York. In addition to a performance at the Knitting Factory, the primary reason for the trip was an invitation from the D√ºsseldorf photographer Andreas Gursky: he wanted the band to open his retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art with a concert. In November 2001 an EP with Chicks on Speed was released. In addition to three original compositions, they also included a cover of the Nick Cave- Kylie Minogue duet \\"Where The Wild Roses Grow\\" ‚Äì here, however, with the gender roles reversed. The production garnered positive reviews in The Face, The Wire, NME and was found repeatedly on John Peel's playlists. =2002‚Äì2004= Early February 2002 Kreidler gave a preview at the Kunstverein D√ºsseldorf of the new Kreidler album Eve Future, which varied themes from the band's catalog in a seemingly baroque garb. Detlef Weinrich created six short films to be presented in an installation with live music. In April the video clip for La Casa made the final rounds of the Muvi-Clip Awards at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen. In the summer of 2003 Kreidler was invited by the Goethe Institute for a series of performances in South East Asia. Eight concerts and a seminar were held in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Manila, Hanoi and Bangkok. This is thought to have had an effect on the album that appeared the following year, Eve Future Recall: \\"With almost mathematical meticulousness, Kreidler have recorded percussive pop gems which are related to Japanese folklore, but also to the metallophone music of Bali. Inso, Kreidler make an extraordinary transfer: they absorb the new music reception of non-European music and transform it into pop\\" wrote Martin B√ºsser. =2005-2008= In the following years it was quiet with Kreidler. With the exception of the soundtrack composed by Klein and Reihse for Alexandra Sell's film Durchfahrtsland in 2005 and occasional concerts, the individual members were more involved in their various side projects. In 2008, however, Klein, Reihse and Weinrich reassembled for the production of a new album. =2009‚Äì2012= In October 2009, Kreidler released \\"Mosaik 2014\\", with the single \\"Impressions d'Afrique\\" in spring 2010. The album found positive reviews in the media: 4 stars by Philip Sherburne for Emusic,\\"It's hard to put your finger on, but you can feel it, and that's precisely what gives the record its charge: humans imitating machines imitating humans, or maybe the other way round\\" Philip Sherburne, Emusic October 2009 4.3/5 by the Milkman. Boomkat stated \\"An engrossing and entirely out-of-its-time album from an always intriguing fixture of the German leftfield\\" and Irish Daily Star \\"The leftfield German outfit compose a soundtrack to a sci-fi movie full of Italo disco and spacey, ambient sequences.\\" While it was highly acclaimed in the German media: Record of the issue in Spex, Groove, or Titel Magazin, record of the year in online magazine Machtdose. The 12 inch single Impressions d'Afrique featured a remix of Ralf Beck. During the following tour Alex Paulick again supported the band and established himself as a full member of Kreidler on the forthcoming albums. In May 2010 Kreidler were invited by NRW- Forum D√ºsseldorf to play a concert solely on the iPhone as part of a Night of the Museums. What was claimed as the first iPhone concert ever. The session was released in February 2011 as a limited annual bonus for friends and supporters of the museum. In Spring 2011 Kreidler released Tank on the label Bureau-B, up to then mostly famous for its delicate re-issues of classic albums of German electronic and Krautrock artists. According to Alan Holmes \\"Tank captures Kreidler's live sound more faithfully than ever before, the constant tension between the live rhythm section and sequenced electronics creating a thrilling urgency imbued with the icy precision and nervous energy of a true menschmaschine.\\" Bomkat stated: \\"Anyone who has been interested in the music scene's move towards shaky, dirty post-punk, disco and early electronic progression recently should check this without delay. Huge recommendation\\". Jus Forrest wrote in Igloo magazine: 'Its earthy wooded areas are met with shiny melodic twinkle, driving rhythm, and small droplets from the heavens. Simple and direct in structure, Tank shows off a perfect framework on which to add the emotional and expressive., and Mike Schiller: \\"Tank went from twinkle in Kreidler's eye to realized longplayer in less than two total weeks of work, and nothing about it sounds the least bit raw or unfinished. The cover artwork was provided by Andro Wekua, who continued to collaborate with the band in summer 2011 for a limited edition gatefold set which contained a print of Wekua alongside a vinyl record with new Kreidler song Mars in four different versions (one of each band member). =Side projects= Thomas Klein works with his partner Petra Bosch as Fauna, solo as Clyne and has recently released the album S√∏lyst. Andreas Reihse and Detlef Weinrich produced techno as Binford, as April & Seasons they remixed Kante, and with Alex Paulick and Rob Taylor they called themselves Dark Park. Detlef Weinrich's DJ alias was Sport. As Toulouse Low Track he creates a slow, rhythmic kind of club music that is a relative of old-school Electro. He is also responsible for the artistic/musical program at the D√ºsseldorf Bar Salon des Amateurs. Andreas Reihse's has published as April as well as under his own name, as Herkules Dreigang Duo with Thomas Brinkmann and as BadFrench with Kiki Moorse formerly Chicks on Speed. Klein and Reihse worked with Klaus Dinger in la!NEU?. Alex Paulick works with Rob Taylor as Coloma (formerly Barett Velox, formerly Tonic), and with his partner Caroline Melzig as Narrow Bridges. In 2010 he started 7 Speakers, a series of surround audio installations, e.g. in February 2011 at Transmediale. Paulick is running the digital label Alesque for his projects as well as for friends (e.g. Mildred Hightower, Nolan Churn) =Guest musicians= Kreidler occasionally work with guest musicians. Florian D√ºrr, now bassist with Kante, played guitar on two tracks on the Weekend album as Flo Metzger; the British singer-songwriter Momus and Argentinean pop star Leo Garcia appear as vocalists on Kreidler, Petra Bosch on Eve Future, and the piece Von Valerie on Eve Future Recall features Valerie Sajdik speaking a text. Kreidler have improvised pieces at concerts together with Tarwater, Momus and Add N to (X). In their first year of existence they regularly accompanied spoken word artists such as Stan Lafleur, Mithu or Zappo.

During a racing career that lasted from May 1803 to April 1807 he was lightly campaigned, running six times in five seasons and winning four races. In the summer of 1803 he proved himself one of the best British colts of his generation, by winning Derby on his only appearance on the season. He went on to win two important races at Newmarket and a King's Plate at Guildford. Ditto was retired to stud in 1808 and had some success as a sire of winners. Background The name of the 1803 Derby winner appears in at least three forms. When he won the Derby his name was recorded as Ditto Ditto; when he raced in 1804 and 1805 his name had been reduced to simply Ditto; in pedigrees he was usually listed as Williamson's Ditto. The third of these forms was used to avoid confusion: apart from the fact that there were other horses with similar names, the phrase \\"by ditto\\" was very frequently used in the General Stud Book to mean \\"sired by the same stallion as the previous horse\\". Ditto was a bay horse, described as having \\"great size\\" and a \\"fine temper\\" bred by his owner Sir Hedworth Williamson. His sire, Sir Peter Teazle (or simply \\"Sir Peter\\") won the Epsom Derby in 1787 and became the most successful stallion of the time, winning the title of Champion sire on ten occasions between 1799 and 1809. Ditto's dam Arethusa, who was bred by the Prince of Wales, was one of the most successful broodmares of her era: apart from Ditto she produced the leading stallion Walton the Derby winner Pan and the Ascot Gold Cup winner Lutzen. Racing career =1803: three-year-old season= Ditto made his first racecourse appearance on 26 May in the Derby at Epsom. Despite his lack of previous experience he was made 7/2 second favourite in a field of six runners. Ridden by Bill Clift, he won the first prize of 1,650 guineas by beating Lord Grey's unnamed Sir Peter colt and Sir Frank Standish's unnamed Brother to Stamford, the 7/4 favourite. Ditto's owners were later to claim that he won the race \\"in a trot\\". The first three were all sired by Sir Peter Teazle. =1804: four-year-old season= Ditto reappeared after a break of more than ten months when he ran at the Craven meeting at Newmarket in the spring of 1804. On 17 April he ran in the Claret Stakes over the two mile \\"Ditch In\\" course in which he was re-opposed by Frank Standish's still unnamed Brother to Stamford. Ditto started the 4/7 favourite and reproduced his Derby- winning form to beat the Brother to Stamford and Discussor to take the first prize of 1,200 guineas. Ditto was then off the course for a year. =1805: five-year-old season= Ditto returned for the Craven Stakes, an all-aged race run over ten furlongs \\"Across the Flat\\" at Newmarket on 15 April 1805. He started 3/1 second favourite in a field of eleven runners and won the race from the four-year-old colts Castrel and Agincourt. Three days later he ran a match race against Lord Foley's Sir Harry Dimsdale, a grey horse who had finished unplaced in the Craven Stakes. Running over Newmarket's four mile Beacon Course, Ditto started favourite but suffered his first defeat as he failed to concede seven pounds to his opponent. On 4 June Ditto ran in a King's Plate at Guildford Racecourse. King's Plates were races in which horses carried heavy weights and ran in a series of heats, with the first horse to take two heats being the winner. Carrying 160 pounds, Ditto beat his only rival, a five-year-old mare named Gipsy, in the first of the four mile heats and claimed the prize when the mare was withdrawn from the second heat. =1807: seven-year-old season= After missing the whole of the 1806 season, Ditto returned in 1807 as the property of Mr Wilson. On 29 April Ditto ran in a handicap race over Newmarket's Ditch Mile course. He carried top weight of 131 pounds and started 7/4 favourite but finished unplaced behind Hippomenes Later the same afternoon, Mr Wilson claimed a 20 guinea forfeit when Ditto's scheduled opponent, Hedley, was withdrawn from a one-mile match race. Ditto did not race again and was retired to stud. Stud career Between 1810 and 1814 Ditto was standing as a stallion at Snitterfield, near Stratford-upon- Avon in Warwickshire at a fee of 10 guineas for thoroughbreds and 5 guineas for half-bred mares. He was listed as being the property of Mr Hawkes. By 1815 he had been moved to Bildeston, near Bury St. Edmunds and was standing at a fee of 12 guineas. Ditto's most notable offspring was Luzborough, who won twenty-five races and was exported to the United States where he became a very successful sire.

He was Dayan of Erlau, Hungary and author of a halachic responsa sefer named Yad Sofer. He was the son of Rabbi Shimon Sofer (II) (Hisorerus Tshuva), grandson of Rabbi Avraham Shmuel Binyamin Sofer (Ksav Sofer) and great-grandson of Rabbi Moshe Sofer (Chasam Sofer). He was the father of Rabbi Yochanan Sofer, current rebbe of Erlau. He perished at Auschwitz during the Holocaust. Early life Sofer was born on 10 May 1885 to his father Rabbi Shimon (Chief Rabbi of Erlau) and mother Malka Esther Spitzer. Malka was the daughter of Gitel Schreiber (daughter of the Chasam Sofer) and Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Spitzer (1811‚Äì1893), Rabbi of Schiffschul, Vienna (author of Tikun Shlomo). In his adolescent years, Sofer learned at the yeshiva of Rabbi Avraham Greenberg in Ke≈æmarok, Hungary. He later learned at the Pressburg Yeshiva under the auspices of Rabbi Akiva Sofer (author of Daas Sofer). Sofer soon became known as a Torah genius and would engage in written halachic responsa with great rabbis such as Rabbi Sholom Mordechai Schwadron of Berezhany, Rabbi Yitzchak Glick of Tolcsva (author of Yad Yitzchak) and Rabbi Nethanel Fried of Balmaz√∫jv√°ros (author of Pnei Meivin). At the Yeshiva, Rabbi Akiva Sofer once pointed out Sofer to a visitor, affectionately saying: \\"This is our Rosh Yeshiva\\". Rabbi Mordechai Leib Winkler (1845‚Äì1932) of Mad (author of Levushei Mordechai) wrote that Sofer was baki (fluent) in Talmud Bavli, Talmud Yerushalmi, Rishonim and Acharonim. Sofer received Semicha from various rabbis prior to his marriage. Married life Sofer married Tushene (Heb.: ◊ò◊ï◊©◊¢◊†◊¢) (c. 1886-1944), the daughter of Rabbi Moshe Yochanan Schoenfeld (1848‚Äì1913), Rabbi of √ârmih√°lyfalva. For a few years, Sofer engaged in business, but was ultimately appointed to preside as Dayan on the Beth Din of the Erlau Orthodox congregation. His father, Rabbi Shimon, requested that he be retested by three rabbis and ordained Semicha once again before joining the Beth Din; something Rabbi Moshe did with ease. Sofer was offered many prestigious rabbinical positions, but turned them down in order to be with his father and to invest his time in publishing the Torah commentaries of his illustrious family. Sofer edited and published the works of the Chassam Sofer, Ksav Sofer and Sofer Mahir (authored by Rabbi Yitzchak Leib Sofer of Drohobych, son of the Ksav Sofer) and authored many of his own works on the Torah, most of which were lost during the war. As his father aged, Sofer became more active in communal matters and served as the active rav and dayan of Erlau alongside his father. He also supervised the cheder and yeshiva. Children Sofer and his wife had six children; Avraham Shmuel Binyamin, Yochanan, Chava Rivka, Leah, Gitel Tobia and Reizel. Avraham Shmuel Binyamin was a Torah genius and studied at the Yeshiva of Rabbi Yosef Asher Pollack (1888 - 1944) (author of She'eris Yosef Asher), in Verpel√©t, Hungary. He also studied at the Yeshiva of Rabbi Chaim Mordechai Roller (1868‚Äì1947) (author of Be'er Chaim Mordechai) in Piatra Neam≈£, Romania, from whom he received Semicha. Yochanan also studied at the Verpel√©t Yeshiva, and later became Rabbi of Erlau and Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivas Chassam Sofer in Budapest and Eger. He re-founded the Yeshiva in Jerusalem, Israel and was the previous Rebbe of the Erlau Hasidic Dynasty. Chava Rivka, Leah, Gitel Tobia and Reizel all were unmarried and perished in the Holocaust. Death and legacy In 1944, Sofer and his family were deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis (with the exception of his son Avraham Shmuel Binyamin) together with the Jews of Erlau. On 12 June 1944 (21 Sivan 5704), Sofer, his wife, daughters and his father Rabbi Shimon were murdered by the Nazis. He was survived by his sons, Avraham Shmuel Binyamin and Yochanan. After World War II, Avraham Shmuel and Yochanan reunited in Budapest. There they re- established the Yeshivas Chassam Sofer together with Rabbi Moshe Stern (1914‚Äì1997) of Debrecen (author of Be'er Moshe). In 1947, the brothers moved to Eger (Erlau) and re-established the Kehilla and Yeshiva there. Though Avraham Shmuel was older than Yochanan, he preferred that Yochanan assume the rabbinical position, giving him and the Yeshiva full support, both personally and monetarily. Avraham Shmuel engaged in business, but spent much of his time in the Yeshiva studying with the students. Avraham Shmuel died in 1948, unmarried, due to an illness. He was buried in the Jewish Cemetery in Eger, near the grave of his grandmother Malka Esther Sofer. Yochanan, the sole survivor of Sofer's family, married Miram Pall (daughter of Yaakov Pall, descendant of the Chassam Sofer's sister). They had three children in Eger; Moshe (1947), Yaakov (1948) and Avraham Shmuel Binyomin Sofer (1949). After emigrating to Israel in 1950, they had four more children; Shimon (1951), Akiva Menachem (1953), Zalman (1954) and Aharon (1959). Yochanan refounded the Yeshiva in Jerusalem, Israel, and over the years established a network of synagogues in Israel and the USA naming them ‚ÄúKehillot Yad Sofer‚Äù after his father. Yochanan led a respectable community in Israel retaining the name Erlau. He was a presiding member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah, and a key leader and posek of the Charedi population in Israel. Written works Sofer authored many Torah commentaries, most of which were lost during the Holocaust. Remaining today is his responsa on the Shulchan Aruch named Yad Sofer (Hand of the Scribe). This book of responsa was published by his son, Yochanan, who added his own commentary and notations named Itur Sofrim (Ornament of the Scribes). These sefarim were printed in 1949 in Budapest at Gewirtz Brothers Printery.

Between 1395 and 1459, it passed through the control of the Venetian Republic, the Dukagjini family, the Ottoman Empire, and Skanderbeg, who razed it sometime after 1459. History =Lordship of Zeta and Zaharia family = Together with Scutari and surrounding region, Sati was a part of the Lordship of Zeta until 1395. It belonged to the fief of Konstantin Bal≈°iƒá who appointed Koja Zaharia as Sati's castellan. In 1395 Bal≈°a II ceded Sati, together with Scutari and Drivast, to the Venetian Republic in order to create a buffer zone between his lordship and the Ottoman Empire. Zaharia refused to allow Venetians to take control of Sati and proclaimed himself lord of Sati and Dagnum (\\"dominus Sabatensis et Dagnensis\\"). Venetians attempted to capture Sati by force in 1396 but without success because Zaharia was supported by Ottoman Empire since in the meantime he had become an Ottoman vassal. Still, after a year Venetians managed to convince Koja to allow them to appoint Venetian citizen Progon Dukagjin on the position of castellan of Sati. The Zaharia family was able to consolidate its control of Sati; another member, Petar or Pjet√´r was bishop of Sati (e—Äis—Å–æ—Äus Sati) in 1417. After his death, Koja Zaharia was succeeded by his son Lek√´ Zaharia. =During Skanderbeg's rebellion= Lek√´ Zaharia was killed in 1444 by his pronoiar, Nicholas Dukagjini. Because Lek√´ Zaharia joined the League of Lezhe in 1444 and Dukagjin was also a member, Skanderbeg requested that Venice cede Zaharia's former pronoia to him. In spite of Skanderbeg's claims, Zaharia's mother Bo≈°a and the population of Zaharia's pronoia supported the Venetian takeover of their towns, including Sati, because they were hostile toward Skanderbeg's League of Lezhe and preferred Venice to any local supporter of the League. Nikola Dukagjin continued his struggle, now against the new authorities, and managed to capture Sati and several villages without a fight. In 1446, Dukagjin appears in Venetian archives as a \\"former enemy\\" (tunc hostis noster). After Venetian recaptured Dagnum from Lek√´ Dukagjini at the beginning of September 1457, the governor of Scutari initially granted the Zadrima region to Draga Dukagjin (another member of Dukagjin family and enemy of Lek√´ Dukagjini) under the excuse that it belonged to Sati. Draga Dukagjin, who was upset because of the treaty between Venetians and Lek√´ and Pal Dukagjini, begged the Venetian Senate to confirm his rights over the fortress of Sati. The Venetian Senate did not accept the decision of Scutari's governor and confirmed Draga Dukagjin's rights over Sati and the surrounding area on 11 September 1458. In 1459, Skanderbeg's forces captured Sati from the Ottoman Empire and Skanderbeg ceded it to Venice in order to secure a cordial relationship with its Signoria before he sent his troops to Italy to help King Ferdinand to regain and maintain his kingdom after the death of king Alfonso V of Aragon. According to the treaty, the Venetians had an obligation to raze the fortress and to take away from the hill all remaining construction material to prevent future rebuilding of the fortress. Before the Venetians took control of Sati, Skanderbeg captured it and the surrounding area, driving Lek√´ Dukagjini and his forces away, then destroyed Sati.

Design and development The T-2M was developed by the Antonov Design Bureau at the end of the Cold War when it became necessary to explore civil markets for aircraft, including microlights for club flying. Aside from production for recreational purposes, the T-2M was also designed for use by the Russian Special Forces for use on infiltration missions, and as such incorporated a sophisticated wing folding mechanism at their request. The T-2M features a cable-braced hang glider-style high-wing, weight-shift controls, a two-seats- in-side-by-side configuration open cockpit, tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration. The aircraft is made from tubing, with its wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its area wing is supported by a single tube- type kingpost and uses an \\"A\\" frame control bar. The standard engine supplied was the Rotax 582 twin-cylinder, two-stroke, liquid-cooled powerplant. The smaller Rotax 503 and the four-stroke Rotax 912 were also supplied. The T-2M introduced two features not found on western trikes. It has side-by-side seating, which offers advantages in flight training and also has a large single piece leaf spring main landing gear, which is simple, light, low drag and eliminates many of the large number of parts that other designs use. The aircraft can be operated on wheels, skis and floats. An agricultural aircraft aerial application package is also available.

It aired on February 6, 2012. This marked director Greg Yaitanes' 30th and final directorial effort on House. Plot House and his team are subjected to a disciplinary hearing after their patient suffered a psychotic breakdown and stabbed Chase. The hearing is conducted by Dr. Walter Colfield, Foreman's former mentor at Johns Hopkins University. The patient is a chemistry teacher who was injured during a chemistry experiment gone wrong. An explosion occurs which initiates the medical issue. Each member of the team comes up with a different initial diagnosis. As Chase attempts to biopsy the patient's rash, the patient suffers another psychotic episode and stabs Chase with a scalpel, lacerating his heart. Chase survives surgery but is left paralyzed. House concludes that the paralysis is caused by a blood clot. Chase regains feeling when surgery is performed to remove the clot that is pressing on his spine, but he faces extensive physical therapy. House goes to see the patient before he is transferred. He finds his wife and tells her that her husband has a lymph node tumor and requires full body radiation therapy and plasmapheresis. During the last day of the hearing, Dr. Colfield calls House brilliant but a fiasco; however, the patient's wife speaks up on House's behalf, saying House \\"saved my husband's life\\". At this point Colfield decides that House is an important part of the hospital and he would damage the hospital by sending him back to prison. Therefore, he rules that the accident was \\"nobody's fault\\". House before leaving accuses Colfield of being a coward; he then goes to see Chase, who is doing his rehabilitation exercises. House tells Chase how Colfield decided that his stabbing was nobody's fault, but he then says \\"they're wrong, I'm sorry.\\" Chase blows him off, asking him if he's done, stating that he's kind of busy at the moment. House leaves without saying anything else. Reception The A.V. Club gave this episode a B- rating, while Lisa Palmer of TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5/5.0.

It is based in Portsmouth, England. The company is part of the WiggleCRC group, which also includes Chain Reaction Cycles.  History  The origins of Wiggle trace back to a local bike shop called Butlers Cycles, located in Portsmouth. Mitch Dall, a founder of Wiggle, bought the shop in 1995. Wiggle started trading in May 1999, with an initial investment of ¬£2000 from Dall and Harvey Jones. Between 1999 and 2009, Wiggle experimented with online retail, and experienced strong growth. By 2006, Wiggle was turning over ¬£11.8m and Livingbridge private equity took a 42% stake in the company. After a further three years of 40% growth, Livingbridge bought the remaining 58% in 2009, including Dall's remaining 26% stake. Livingbridge brought in Humphrey Cobbold as CEO in December 2009. By 2011, projected annual revenue was ¬£118m following strong international growth helped by a weak pound. Andy Bond, the former CEO of Asda, was hired to help this process. In 2011, Livingbridge considered taking the company public in an initial public offering, with the company's overall value estimated at ¬£200m, and pre-tax profits having risen from ¬£7.1m to ¬£10.2m in the year to January 2011, following a 123 percent increase in international sales. After an auction in December 2011, Wiggle was acquired by venture capitalists Bridgepoint Capital for ¬£180m. Wiggle was now one of 6 European online sports retailers, and no 2 in the UK to Chain Reaction Cycles. In September 2013, after the sale of the business, Cobbold stepped down and Stefan Barden (former CEO of Northern Foods) took over. In 2015, the company consolidated its 3 owned and 1 rented warehouses in Portsmouth to a newer larger 320,000 sq ft facility in Wolverhampton. In 2015, Andy Bond stepped down and Brian McBride joined as chairman. McBride was formerly the CEO of Amazon UK and is the chairman of the online fashion clothing retailer ASOS.  WiggleCRC  The merger of Wiggle and Chain Reaction Cycles was announced in 2016: by this time No1 and No2 largest global online players in the cycle and tri sports product categories. In late 2016, Stefan Barden was replaced by Will Kernan as the new Group CEO \\\\- Kernan was previously the CEO of The White Company, and before that MD and COO at New Look. In January 2019, it was stated that Kernan was to be replaced by Ross Clemmow, a former Debenhams director. The WiggleCRC Group formed after the Competition Commission approved the merger and Wiggle bought 100% of the Chain Reactions Cycle equity from the Watson family for ¬£62m. A key driver of synergies was the closure of CRC‚Äôs Northern Irish warehouse and distribution infrastructure whose volume was integrated into Citadel in Wolverhampton; this process was concluded in December 2017. The Wiggle and Chain Reaction Cycles brands remain distinct, with their own websites. Proforma turnover was over ¬£360m in 2017 and Wiggle was the largest pure-play online sports retailer in Europe. In October 2017 it was announced that WiggleCRC had bought a German competitor and market no.2, Bike 24, for a reported ¬£100m, giving access to German suppliers and a potential 'Brexit hedge'. Group Proforma sales are now believed to be about ¬£500m, and it was announced that the Bike24 brand and websites will continue alongside the Wiggle and Chain Reaction Cycles websites. In 2018, a Chain Reaction Cycles' employee was critical of the group's actions after the merger; citing continued redundancies, shift patterns and a perceived shift of operations away from Ireland to Wolverhampton.

It operates as an umbrella organisation for local groups and independent practitioners. History Eldaring began in 2000 as a private Internet mailing list before it officially was registered as an organisation in 2002. The name is derived from the Old Norse word eldr which means \\"fire\\". It initially functioned as the German branch of the American organisation The Troth but eventually became independent. It was active in the World Congress of Ethnic Religions from the mid 2000s to 2009. As of 2014, Eldaring had around 200 members. Beliefs and activity A text listed as a \\"basic article\\" on Eldaring's website defines heathenry as a religion based on nature, experience and transmission of wisdom. The article says that heathens value deeds over abstract values and life in the world over otherworldly salvation, and rejects the Christian conception of good and evil, the division between secular and spiritual and the concept of original sin. Elsewhere, Eldaring officials have associated their views with Theo Sundermeier's and Jan Assmann's concept of \\"primary religion\\", which refers to religions that have evolved within a culture, society and language, rather than having been revealed. Eldaring generally emphasises the reliance on academic research for the reconstruction of pre-Christian practices. Like The Troth, it views the Poetic Edda as a source for references and orientation, which should be supplemented by summaries of academic research. The organisation generally rejects folkloristic sources, although some members have argued in favour of making exceptions. Eldaring operates as a network of Germanic neopagans. The members generally regard religion as a private matter and are not expected to commit to the organisation, beyond using it as a platform for contacts and service. Members can be active in local divisions called Herde [hearths], local bl√≥t groups, special interests groups, and participate at annual events. The organisation publishes the magazine Herdfeuer [hearth fire] since 2003. It is politically neutral but has as a stated goal to increase public awareness and acceptance of its religious views.

Early life  On July 31, 1797, Paige was born in Schaghticoke, Rensselaer County, New York. Paige's father was Rev. Winslow Paige. Paige's mother was Clarissa (nee Keyes) Paige.  Education  In 1812, Paige graduated from Williams College. Paige was sent by his father to Montgomery County to study theology. After some time, Paige returned to Schenectady and studied law instead.  Career  Paige was admitted to the bar in 1819. Paige was a member of the New York State Assembly (Schenectady Co.) in 1827, 1828, 1829 and 1830. In 1828, he was appointed as Reporter of the New York Court of Chancery, and published 11 volumes of chancery cases until 1845. Paige was a member of the New York State Senate (3rd D.) in 1837, and from 1839 to 1842, sitting in the 60th, 62nd, 63rd, 64th and 65th New York State Legislatures. He was a justice of the New York Supreme Court (4th D.) from 1847 to 1851, and from 1856 to 1857, and a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1867‚Äì68. To undertake real estate development on Hamilton Hill, where the original African Cemetery was located, Paige purchased land for an African Section at Vale Cemetery. He had the burials re-interred in Vale Cemetery at his expense. This protected the graves, as others had disturbed them on the hill in seeking sandy soil for cement making.Katherine Olney Delain, et al. (2005). Biographies of Notables at Vale Cemetery. Schenectady: Friends of Vale  Personal life  On July 11, 1832, Paige married Harriet Bowers Mumford. They had four children, Benjamin Mumford Paige (1834-1838, died at age 4), Clara Keyes Paige (1837-1894), Harriet Bowers Paige (1838-1895), and Edwards Winslow Paige (1844-1918). On March 31, 1867, Paige's wife died in New York. On March 31, 1868, Paige died in Schenectady, New York. Paige was buried at the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Schenectady, New York.

The idea was originated in a Reddit post and the act is being developed in a subsection of Reddit specifically created for this purpose. As one of the first instances of crowd sourcing legislation, it has raised questions concerning public participation in government in the 21st century. The act passed January 12, 2012. Early articles by blog site Techdirt and technology news site Techspot show that there is an interest to see how this proposal will pan out in the wake of the successful Reddit campaign to halt the passage of SOPA and PIPA. Some technology journalists wrote tongue-in-cheek commentaries on the situation. Covered by RT, Alexis Ohanian, Co-founder of Reddit, explained that > This is definitely a first, but I'll tell you we are in uncharted territory. > This is a community that a few years ago decided it was going to be a good > idea to have the world's largest secret santa exchange, and did it.

Points of Discussion In preparation for drafting of the proposed legislation, the community of individuals involved have created threads of discussion and debate dedicated to answering the broad questions associated with legislation of this kind. The topics include: =Privacy= Article VII Section B of the Act states that ‚ÄúEverything a user does with their computer is considered private.‚Äù Any actions a user takes to protect their privacy, such as using proxies, cannot be assumed to be used for illegal actions. The Act classifies the following as private data: all data that can personally identify the owner, harm the owner in any way, data that has not been explicitly agreed to be public, and all encrypted data is considered to be private. Additionally, data collected for judicial proceedings must be able to be used as evidence. According to the act: ‚ÄúAny data absorbed during the search for evidence must be returned to its owner within 15 business days. Any copies of data not used as evidence must be permanently deleted and removed from any kind of storage.‚Äù However, content that a user knows is illegal to upload in a given region is not considered private data (for example, child pornography). Users who download such data and who neglect to report it are also liable for the data. =Censorship= The Act proposes that all sovereign Federal and State Governments cannot censor any kind of material on the Internet other than child pornography and financial scams, and in order to censor those topics, it must be done after they are uploaded because it would be illegal to monitor any data while it is being uploaded. Additionally, only the creator or uploader can be held responsible for illegal material, and any time material is removed, the uploader must be notified. =Free Speech= By prohibiting censorship of the internet, the FIA would carry this most basic American right on to the internet. In the most recent draft of the act, it states that the ‚ÄúFIA will allow internet users to browse freely without any means of censorship, users have the right to free speech and to free knowledge; we govern the content of the internet, governments don‚Äôt.‚Äù With no legal government presiding over online content, one would be able to freely post, share, and say whatever one desired on the internet. =Copyright= Kevin Lincoln, a writer for Business Insider, argued that the Act is extremely weak in protecting copyright because under the act, content that may infringe on copyright can only be policed after it is uploaded. Only the uploader, not the website hosting possibly illegal content, would be penalized. To prove that someone violated copyright, the accuser must prove that the uploader knew they were uploading illegal content and they did not know they were uploading it for Fair Use. The accused person must be notified 30 days before the content is taken down so they have adequate time to fight the claim. Monitoring of content being downloaded, uploaded or edited would not be allowed without legal permission, and to try to remove content without a court order would be considered against the freedom of speech and the perpetrator would be subject to legal penalty. Criticism Techspot published an article that questioned whether the Reddit community effort would be able to produce a successful bill. A Business Insider article alleges that the proposed bill \\"is so weak in protecting copyright that it would likely revert the Internet back to a Wild West-type situation where more or less anything goes.\\" The article concludes that the bill would make violation of copyright widespread and copyright litigation difficult due to increased burdens of proof and increased immunity for hosting. Inside of Reddit, community members have voiced concern about both the direction of the bill and language used in it, suggesting that the use of the community contributions instead of a professional group to draft the bill will decrease the quality of the bill.

Six models were available during the 1980s. Products Keesonic's range of speakers were sold through many specialist UK hi-fi retailers, but the most popular model was the entry level KUB, which was very well reviewed in the UK hi-fi press at the time; there was less consumer interest in the larger speakers. There was also a lot of competition from many other UK loudspeaker brands, and this may have led the company to face more difficult trading conditions. =Kub= One of the original designs, the Keesonic Kub was launched in 1977. The Kub was a compact, two-way, bass reflex loudspeaker using a 5.25-inch diameter paper cone woofer (with flexible rubber surround) and a 3\\" paper cone tweeter. The paper cone tweeter looks very different from the silk or metal dome tweeters seen in many modern loudspeakers. Cone tweeters are more directional than dome tweeters and consequently the listening 'sweet spot' tends to be much smaller. The bass port, which vents air taken from the space behind the woofer, is mounted on the front of the enclosure. The Kub enclosure is covered with real wood veneer and is approximately the same size as its contemporary competitors, the Linn Kan and the BBC LS3/5A. The grille is designed to be removable. In the 1980s, the 'Council of Industrial Design' (CoID) considered the Keesonic Kub to be a 'good design' and it was consequently selected for display at the Design Centre, London. Some Kubs have an 'official' triangular label on the back bearing the slogan 'as selected for the Design Centre, London'. =Super Kub= The success of the Kub prompted Keesonic to launch a slightly larger version called a \\"Super Kub\\", which was still a two-way speaker, using a larger bass drive unit. =Kolt= A small 2-way speaker (smaller than the Kub). Based around a Seas 11F-GX Mid Bass driver and a 1\\" Treble Unit (Seas??) Designed for Mobile Broadcast Monitoring. =KRF= A 3-way speaker with Peerless 25mm dome tweeter, Peerless 75mm midrange unit in its own internal enclosure, and a Dalesford 200mm bass unit in a ported cabinet. =KBM= The KBM is a larger speaker with four drive units. The drive units are all mounted in line. The 250mm bass unit is manufactured by Dalesford and the mid-range and tweeter by Peerless and the super-tweeter by Coles. Two small circular vents are positioned at the bottom of the baffle for bass reinforcement. =701A= A two way ported design with integrated tilted wooden resonant stand. The tweeter is a 25mm soft dome covered by a perforated brass diffuser, and the bass driver is a Peter Keeley designed 200mm unit made by Elac with a bextrene cone. Discontinuation It is believed that Keesonic went out of business in the mid eighties, after the success of making the speakers for Boot's range of hi-fi systems. When Boot's suddenly stopped selling hi-fi, Keesonics had little other business to maintain trading and thus went bankrupt. Peter Keeley Prior to releasing the Keesonic Kubs, Peter Keeley helped Keith Monks develop and put into production the famous 'Keith Monks Audio' Record Cleaning Machine.http://www.keithmonks- rcm.co.uk/makinghistory.html See also * Loudspeaker * Loudspeaker enclosure References Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of the United Kingdom Category:Loudspeaker manufacturers ","title":"Keesonic Loudspeakers"},{"id":"34567646","text":"Tucumania porrecta is a species of snout moth in the genus Tucumania.

In 1574, the king transferred him to Kronborg Castle near Helsing√∏r where he was responsible for coordinating all the sculptural additions. In particular, he designed two entrances, including the grand Royal Entrance complete with a bay, as well as fireplaces for the chambers of the king and his wife, Queen Sophie. It was also decided that the Skanderborg gate should be brought to Kronborg. Van Groningen's work for the king appears to have terminated in 1576 (the work was continued by his son, Herman Gertsen).

Erected at the northern end of the beach at the Anna Square opposite University of Madras, it is an important landmark of Chennai. The statue shows four men toiling to move a rock, depicting the hard work of the labouring class. It bears a semblance to the famed World War II photograph of the raising of the flag on Iwo Jima by the American Marines. It was sculpted by Debi Prasad Roy Chowdhury. The statue is the earliest one to be erected on the beach and is installed close to the site where the country's first commemoration of May Day was held. The statue was installed on the eve of the Republic Day in 1959, as part of the Kamaraj government's drive to beautify the beach. The statue remains the focal point of May Day celebrations in the city. History The Triumph of Labour statue On a summer evening in May 1923, M. Singaravelar, a labour union leader, conducted a meeting at the Marina Beach near Triplicane, calling for recognition of workers' rights, and pledged to create a political party to represent the rights of labourers, which was India's first ever May Day rally. To commemorate this, the Labour statue, depicting an inspiring posture of a team of labourers engrossed at arduous work, was sculpted by Debi Prasad Roy Chowdhury, who was the first Indian principal of the then Government of Madras School of Arts and Crafts (what is today the Tamil Nadu Government College of Fine Arts) and was erected on 25 January 1959, unveiled by the then Governor of Madras, Bishnuram Medhi. A.P. Srinivasan, a night watchman at the School of Arts and Crafts, was the model for second and fourth men from the left while Ramu, a student modeled for the other two men.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Tunstall, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. Its benefice is united with those of St Saviour, Aughton, and St Wilfrid, Halton. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built between 1898 and 1900 to a design by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. It cost ¬£2,358 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), and provided seating for 180 people. The church was originally a chapel of ease in the parish of Holy Trinity, Bolton-le-Sands, becoming a parish church in its own right in 1934. Architecture St Luke's is constructed in sandstone rubble, with red tiled roofs and a timber porch. Its plan consists of a nave, a north aisle, a north porch, a chancel, and a tower at the crossing. The tower has a hipped roof, a buttress at the southwest, and a stair turret rising to a greater height than the tower at the south east. A wooden bellcote protrudes from the roof of the tower. Inside the church is a three-bay arcade carried on circular piers. The tower has a flat ceiling, while the roofs of the nave and chancel are open.

The KVTK contains an RD-0146D engine and is designed for use on Angara rockets. KVTK would be the first hydrogen-powered upper stage for use on a Russian launch vehicle, although Khrunichev has previously produced a hydrogen-powered upper stage (KVD-1) for the Indian GSLV. KVTK is designed to provide up to five ignitions, allowing for complex orbital maneuvering, and have an on-orbit lifespan of up to nine hours. KVTK would allow an increase in payload to GTO of 20-50% compared to the Angara A5's standard Briz-M upper stage, powered by UDMH and N2O4.  History  The KVTK was originally studied as an upper stage for the Energia family of rockets, but in 1987 was superseded by the RCS stage (Retro and Corrections Stage), based loosely on the American S-IVB. In 1996, consideration was briefly given to constructing a KVTK-derived Russian Propulsion Module for the International Space Station.

Different algorithms are evaluated by their ability to predict the Gene Ontology (GO) terms in the categories of Molecular Function, Biological Process, and Cellular Component. The experiment consists of two tracks: (i) the eukaryotic track, (ii) the prokaryotic track. In each track, a set of targets is provided by the organizers. Participants are expected to submit their predictions by the submission deadline, after which they are assessed according to a set of specific metrics. Motivation The genome of an organism may consist of hundreds to tens of thousands of genes, which encode for hundreds of thousands of different protein sequences. Due to the relatively low cost of genome sequencing, determining gene and protein sequences is fast and inexpensive. Thousands of species have been sequenced so far, yet many of the proteins are not well characterized. The process of experimentally determining the role of a protein in the cell, is an expensive and time consuming task. Further, even when functional assays are performed they are unlikely to provide complete insight into protein function. Therefore it has become important to use computational tools in order to functionally annotate proteins. There are several computational methods of protein function prediction that can infer protein function using a variety of biological and evolutionary data, but there is significant room for improvement. Accurate prediction of protein function can have longstanding implications on biomedical and pharmaceutical research. The CAFA experiment is designed to provide unbiased assessment of computational methods, to stimulate research in computational function prediction, and provide insights into the overall state-of-the-art in function prediction. Organization The experiment consists of three phases: # Prediction phase: ~4 months Organizers provide protein sequences with unknown or incomplete function to community and set the deadline for the submission of predictions # Target accumulation: 6‚Äì12 months After all predictions are stored and the experiment enters a waiting period in which protein functions are expected to accumulate in public databases # Analysis Phase: 1 month Predictors are ranked according to their performance. The results are publicly shared in scientific meetings and published after peer review. History The CAFA experiment is conducted by the Automated Function Prediction (AFP) Special Interest Group (AFP/SIG). An AFP/SIG meeting has been held alongside the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2012. The first CAFA experiment was organized between fall 2010 and spring 2012. The organizers provided 48,000 sequences for the community with the task to prediction Gene Ontology annotations for each of these sequences. Of those 48,000 proteins, 866 were experimentally annotated during target accumulation phase. The results showed that current function prediction algorithms perform significantly better than a simple domain assignment or a straightforward use of BLAST package. However, they also revealed that accurate prediction of a protein's biological function is still an open and challenging problem. =CAFA 2010-2012= The first CAFA experiment was organized between fall 2010 and spring 2012.

Lamprin, an insoluble non-collagen, non-elastin protein, is the major connective tissue component of the fibrillar extracellular matrix of lamprey annular cartilage. Although not generally homologous to any other protein, soluble lamprins contain a tandemly repeated peptide sequence (GGLGY), which is present in both silk moth chorion proteins and spider dragline silk. Strong homologies to this repeat sequence are also present in several mammalian and avian elastins. It is thought that these proteins share a structural motif which promotes self- aggregation and fibril formation in proteins through interdigitation of hydrophobic side chains in beta-sheet/beta-turn structures, a motif that has been preserved in recognisable form over several hundred million years of evolution.

Life Riviere was descended from a French family, who left their country on the revocation of the edict of Nantes. His father, Daniel Valentine Riviere (1780‚Äì1854), who was a drawing- master of considerable celebrity and a gold medallist of the Royal Academy, married, in 1800, Henrietta Thunder, by whom he had a family of five sons and six daughters. The eldest and third sons, William Rivi√®re and Henry Parsons Rivi√®re were both painters. Anne, the eldest daughter, became the second wife of Sir Henry Rowley Bishop, the composer, and acquired much distinction as a singer. Robert, the second son, was educated at an academy at Hornsey kept by Mr. Grant, and on leaving school, in 1824, was apprenticed to Messrs. Allman, the booksellers, of Princes Street, Hanover Square, London. In 1829 he established himself at Bath as a bookseller, and subsequently as a bookbinder in a small way, employing only one man. But not finding sufficient scope for his talents in that city, he came in 1840 to London, where he commenced business as a bookbinder at 28 Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, afterwards removing to 196 Piccadilly. The excellent workmanship and good taste displayed in his bindings gradually won for them the appreciation of connoisseurs, and he was largely employed by the Duke of Devonshire, Samuel Christie-Miller, Captain Francis Capper BrookeFrancis Capper Brooke, of Ufford Place, Suffolk, a friend of the poet Edward Fitz-Gerald, was a great scholarly book collector, whose library of more than 20,000 volumes was made available to Fitz-Gerald; (John Glyde, The Life of Edward Fitz-Gerald, 1900:208-10) and other great collectors. He also bound for the queen and the royal family. In the Great Exhibition of 1851 he exhibited several examples of his skill, and he was awarded a medal. He was chosen by the council to bind one thousand copies of the large ‚ÄòIllustrated Catalogue,‚Äô intended for presentation to ‚Äòall the crowned heads in Europe‚Äô and other distinguished persons. It is said that two thousand skins of the best red Morocco, as well as fifteen hundred yards of silk for the linings of the covers, were used by Riviere for this undertaking. He also restored and bound the famous Domesday Book, now preserved in the Record Office.Domesday re-bound (Public Record Office), 1954 reports the rebinding. While the binding of Riviere, like that of his equally celebrated fellow-craftsman, Francis Bedford, is deficient in originality, it is in all other respects‚Äîin the quality of the materials, the forwarding, and in the finish and delicacy of the tooling‚Äîdeserving of almost unqualified commendation. Taking into consideration the fact that he was entirely self- taught, his bindings are wonderful specimens of artistic taste, skill, and perseverance. He died at his residence, 47 Gloucester Road, Regent's Park, on 12 April 1882, and was buried in the churchyard at East End, Finchley. Riviere married, in 1830, Eliza Sarah Pegler, by whom he had two daughters. He bequeathed his business to the eldest son of the second daughter, Mr. Percival Calkin, who had been taken into partnership by his grandfather in 1880, when the style of the firm was altered to Robert Riviere & Son. Riviere bindings may be dated approximately by the stamped signature inside the front covers: Bound by R. Riviere, Bath means 1829‚Äì32; Bound by R. Riviere means 1832‚Äì40; Bound by Riviere means 1840‚Äìc.1860; Bound by Riviere & Son means after 1880.Michael Riviere, \\"The Huguenot family of Riviere in England\\", Proceedings of the Huguenot Society of London 21 (1970).

An alcoholic, he wrote a noted biography of Thomas Chatterton and he wrote \\"In Our Own Dear Homes Again\\" during the American Civil War. Biography Dix was born in Bristol. He said that his mother was taught by Chatterton's sister - Mary Newton. Dix took to poetry writing about sites in Bristol which were published in the Bristol Mirror and later included in an anthology titled \\"Lays of Home\\". In 1832 he married Sussanah Moore whose father boiled soap at Bedminster. They started a business in Wellington in Somerset, but this soon failed. He had three children, two born in Somerset, and a son born in Bristol in 1837. The son was named William Chatterton Dix in honour of his latest publication which was a Life of Thomas Chatterton. The book contained not only a biography but many of Chatterton's poems. This book contained some of Chatterton's unpublished early work but it was said to be full of half truths and even had a now discredited portrait. Dix quickly took classes to study medicine at the expense of his friends and obtained work as a surgeon in Monmouth just over the border in Wales. His need for alcohol meant that his medical business failed and he took again to writing poems in 1837 that were combined with engravings by Edward Villiers Rippingille to create Progress of Intemperance. Dix served time in Cardiff Gaol for debt despite applying to the Royal Literary Fund. His claims of employment around this time included editor of the Monmouth Beacon, esquire, bodyguard and traveller. In 1845 his biography of Chatterton was published in Boston, Massachusetts after he had worked his passage as ship's surgeon. By 1847 he was back again in London asking for money from the Royal Literary Fund and despite taking a pledge of temperance he was ill and alcoholic. Dix's writings included fantasies of his friendship with Hannah More and Robert Southey and also longer descriptions of major poets like William Wordsworth. Actually one of Dix's poems, Church Wreck had once \\"ill advisedly\\" been compared to Wordsworth. By 1850 Dix was back in America writing books on temperance, but having abandoned his family in England and having taken the name John Ross and John Ross Dix. Dix was writing also on religious subjects. In 1860 he published The New Apostles, an attack on the Catholic Apostolic Church. Based on this book, he had a theological dispute with Edward Eddis, member of the Catholic Apostolic Church. His last known location is America where in 1864 he published at least a dozen ballads that supported the Unionist cause in the Civil War.

The game is played by two teams of four or more players. One member of each team takes a wooden baseball-sized ball and kicks the ball ahead. The members of that team then chase after the ball, pick it up then kick it again. This is usually done for several miles in the casual games. However, in the serious inter-village contests, held after all-night parties, during which much of the Tarahumara corn beer, Tejuino o Tesg√ºino, is enjoyed by all, the games will often go on for thirty or forty miles. Gameplay Once the game starts, one runner on each team usually pulls into the front and always takes care of the ball. However, after a few miles or after the ball rolls under an outcrop of rock in the canyons, the rest of the team is able to catch up and the front runner is able to fall back into the main group and rest. The game ends when one team finishes the distance agreed upon by both teams prior to the start of the race.

The ship is fully cellular, has nine holds, and has a cargo capacity of 8749 TEU. The ship is 335.07 meters in length, 42.87 meters across the beam, and draws a draught of 14.61 meters. The ship features a main propulsion plant of a B&W; 12K98ME that generates 93,323 hp. The main engine drives a single, fixed-pitch screw, capable of propelling the vessel at a speed of 24.5 knots. Crane collapses at docks On January 18, 2008 at approximately 4:35pm, a crane collapsed onto the Kyoto Express at the Southampton Container Terminals. The part of the dock was evacuated, and there were no reported injuries. Even after four weeks from the crane incident, many ships and vessels had to reroute to other ports due to the dock's suspended operations for rebuilding and repairing. The Kyoto Expresss departure was delayed for about 10 days while debris and damaged containers from the collapse were cleared from the ship and dock. Due to the incident, Honda lost total production at its South Marston factory because the parts could not be delivered, and the 5,000 staff members were sent home. The Kyoto Express was carrying gearboxes and transmissions for Swindon from the Far East that were eventually rerouted to Amsterdam which had to be then transported on land to the United Kingdom. \\"This crane failure at Southampton at the weekend has caused us a major problem with the unloading of key engine components,\\" said Julie Cameron, head of corporate communications at Honda. \\"As a result the car production was disrupted due to this parts shortage. Arrangements have been made to transport the outstanding parts, by road, back to the UK. We are expecting delivery this morning, when full production is estimated to restart on both lines. During this non-production time, associates are being given an opportunity to take holidays and other activities such as training are planned.\\" The projected loss of production was between 600 and 1,000 vehicles.

The resulting storm initially caused the ship to go in a parametric roll, in which the ship rocked side to side 32 degrees. To decrease this effect, the ship master was able to change direction of the ship and brought the rolls down to 20 degrees. The ship encountered a sudden wave which made the ship list at 44 degrees for ten seconds. Everyone on the bridge was \\"catapulted across the bridge\\", the report said, except the second officer. A Filipino AB on the bridge succumbed to his wounds sustained during the incident and was pronounced dead, while the master was airlifted to Hong Kong for treatment of serious injuries. An investigation of this event revealed that there was not a sufficient number of hand rails on the bridge of the ship. This accident and several similar ones caused the ship designers to question some designs of new ships.Adam Corbett London, 15 January 2010, Article 1  Illegal cargo  The Chicago Express was caught up in a shipping scandal in a port in Hampshire. Reportedly officials found a banned sweet, that caused the deaths of four children earlier in the year, in a couple of containers from the ship. This gave the officials probable cause to search the rest of the ship's cargo, in which they also found illegally imported goods such as 20,000 cigarettes, shrimp paste, condensed milk and beef jerky. The companies that tried to import the illegal goods got a notice for the destruction of the goods and Customs and Excise will charge them for the service.Author unknown, 3 September 2008, Article 1  References   External links  * Hapag-Lloyd Corporate Website Category:2005 ships Chicago express ","title":"Chicago Express (ship)"},{"id":"34568166","text":"The CSCL Zeebrugge is a (fully cellular) container ship owned by Seaspan Corp.

Written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and directed by Bradley Buecker, the episode aired on Fox in the United States on February 21, 2012. It features New Directions competing against the Dalton Academy Warblers at the Regionals show choir competition, Rachel (Lea Michele) and Finn (Cory Monteith) moving up their wedding, the return of special guest stars Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell as Rachel's fathers, and the attempted suicide of Dave Karofsky (Max Adler). The episode received a strong and varied reaction from reviewers. Most heaped praise on the scenes featuring Karofsky, both the events leading up to his suicide attempt and when Kurt (Chris Colfer) visited him in the hospital. However, many felt the strength of this storyline unbalanced the episode, and the rest of the episode, particularly the Regionals competition and the Rachel and Finn wedding storyline, did not measure up. The final scene, which ended with Quinn (Dianna Agron) being in a potentially fatal car crash, was controversial. The only song that was given a strongly enthusiastic reception was \\"Cough Syrup\\", which was sung by Blaine (Darren Criss) and used to soundtrack the Karofsky suicide sequence. The other songs, all performances for the Regionals competition, received a mixture of reviews. Five of the six singles released from this episode charted on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard Canadian Hot 100; the mash-up of \\"Fly\\" and \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\" performed by New Directions charted the highest in the US, while \\"What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)\\" performed by the Troubletones as part of the New Directions set charted the best of the five in Canada. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 7.46 million American viewers and received a 3.0/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The total viewership was up from \\"Heart\\", which aired the previous week. Plot With the Regionals Competition imminent, Dalton Academy Warblers captain Sebastian Smythe (Grant Gustin) threatens to post a sexually explicit photoshopped picture of Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) on the Internet unless New Directions co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) withdraws from the competition. Rachel, who believes that her performance is crucial to her admission to NYADA, refuses to do so, which angers Finn. Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at his school and subsequently bullied by his teammates in the locker room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes shock at his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe they could have done more to help him when he had been a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, to remind them that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should not forget what is ahead of them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals. Regionals opens with the Warblers performing two songs, \\"Stand\\" and \\"Glad You Came\\", and the second group, the Golden Goblets, are strong performers as well. In the choir room, before New Directions goes on, Finn announces that he and Rachel are getting married afterward, and tells the group to live each day as if it is their last. New Directions opens their set with a mash-up of \\"Fly\\" and \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\", which is followed by a Troubletones performance of \\"What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)\\". Rachel ends the set by performing \\"Here's to Us\\", and New Directions wins the competition, with the Warblers finishing second. Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) asks cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) to allow her to rejoin the Cheerios, but Sue refuses, although she confides in Quinn that she is pregnant. However, following Regionals, she changes her mind, and gives Quinn a cheerleading uniform. Quinn also changes her mind about Finn and Rachel's marriage and tells Rachel that she now supports it, and hopes it isn't too late to be a bridesmaid. Hiram Berry (Jeff Goldblum) and Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) attempt to devise a last-minute scheme to derail the wedding. Rachel is reluctant to start without Quinn, who has driven home to pick up her bridesmaid's dress, and texts Quinn to find out where she is. Quinn is responding to Rachel's text when a truck crashes into the driver's side of her car. Production \\"On My Way\\" is the second episode to be written by co- producer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, whose first episode was this season's \\"The First Time\\"; the episode was directed by co-executive produce Bradley Buecker. The cast began work on the episode on January 30, 2012; the final two numbers for the previous episode, \\"Heart\\", were filmed on the following day, January 31, 2012. The Regionals competition scenes concluded the filming for the episode, and were shot on the two days ending February 8, 2012. Special guest stars Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell return as Rachel's fathers Hiram and LeRoy Berry. Other recurring guest stars include glee club members Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), Rory Flanagan (Damian McGinty) and Sugar Motta (Vanessa Lengies), Dalton Academy Warbler Sebastian Smythe (Grant Gustin), Kurt and Finn's parents Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) and Carole Hudson-Hummel (Romy Rosemont), former McKinley student Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and his father Paul (Daniel Roebuck), Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones), and new McKinley transfer student Joe Hart (Samuel Larsen). Glee co-creator Ian Brennan appeared in the episode as a Regionals competition judge named Svengoobles, a parody of the character Svengoolie. NeNe Leakes, who plays coach Roz Washington, was announced by a Fox press release as guest starring in the episode, and Leakes and Chris Colfer both tweeted a picture of the two of them together from the set during the filming of the Regionals competition, but the scenes shot with Leakes did not appear in the episode as broadcast, nor was she credited. A scene between Rachel and Quinn, which was shown during a promo for the episode, also did not appear, having been cut \\"for time\\", but it was released as a YouTube video on August 2, 2012, by executive producer Ryan Murphy. The episode features performances of cover versions of eight songs, and seven of them are being released as six singles, available for downloading, with the two-song mash-up released as one single. The songs on the singles include \\"Cough Syrup\\" by Young the Giant, performed by Darren Criss; \\"Glad You Came\\" by The Wanted and \\"Stand\\" by Lenny Kravitz, performed by the Dalton Academy Warblers; Kelly Clarkson's \\"What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)\\" performed by the Troubletones, a mash-up of \\"Fly\\" by Nicki Minaj featuring Rihanna with R. Kelly's \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\" performed by New Directions; and \\"Here's to Us\\" by Halestorm, performed by Michele and New Directions. The eighth song is performed by a glee club from the school Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow: Eric Barnum's setting of Lord Byron's poem \\"She Walks in Beauty\\". The vocal rendition comes from a 2008 recording by University of Redlands' Madrigal Singers. The soundtrack uses the original \\"Chapel of Love\\" by The Dixie Cups during the episode's final sequence; the song was briefly covered by Hiram and LeRoy Berry in the previous episode, \\"Heart\\". The teen suicide storyline, and the public service announcement broadcast during the episode for The Trevor Project, an organization that works to prevent LGBT suicide, resulted in a record number of calls to the project's hotline and record traffic for its website. According to Trevor Project cofounder Peggy Rajski, because the show \\"worked in conjunction\\" with them, they were prepared in advance to handle the greater hotline traffic, which was \\"triple the [usual] number of calls\\"; they also saw a nearly sevenfold increase to 10,000 website visitors on the evening the program aired. The \\"idea for a character to get into a texting-while-driving accident\\" has been under consideration since April 2010, and was inspired by the appearance of the show's cast early that month on The Oprah Winfrey Show. At the time, the cast members signed contracts at Winfrey's behest, pledging not to text while they were driving. Reception =Ratings= \\"On My Way\\" was first broadcast on February 21, 2012 in the United States on Fox. It received a 3.0/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and attracted 7.46 million American viewers during its initial airing, an increase over the 2.8/8 rating/share and 6.99 million viewers of the previous episode, which was broadcast on February 14, 2012. Viewership increased slightly in Canada, where 1.74 million viewers watched the episode on the same day as its American premiere. It was the fifteenth most-viewed show of the week, down two slots but up about 1% from the 1.72 million viewers who watched \\"Heart\\" the previous week.Canadian viewership data: *\\"On My Way\\": *\\"Heart\\": In the United Kingdom, \\"On My Way\\" first aired on March 29, 2012, and was watched on Sky 1 by 763,000 viewers.

It was watched by 558,000 viewers, which made Glee the fifteenth most-watched program of the night, down from fourteenth two weeks before, when the previous episode, \\"Heart\\", aired. Actual viewership declined less than 1% from the 563,000 viewers on March 9, 2012.Australian viewership data: *\\"On My Way\\": *\\"Heart\\": =Critical reception= There was a strong and varied reaction to the episode by reviewers. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone described it as \\"an emotional rollercoaster that at times may have been jarring or heavy-handed, but overall did what a winter finale should: gave us plenty of surprises, while setting things up for the future\\". IGN's Robert Canning was \\"won over by a powerfully acted and directed story\\" and gave the episode a \\"great\\" rating of 8.0 out of 10; he noted that \\"as is often the case, the smaller stories involving Karofsky and Quinn were more successful than larger arcs like Rachel and Finn's\\". Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle said that rather than \\"a million different storylines\\" there were a few \\"really good ones\\" and added, \\"It was chaos, but controlled chaos.\\" The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff wrote, \\"The sequence in which Karofsky prepared himself for death was, unquestionably, one of the best things Glee has ever done.\\" She added that it was \\"all the more a shame\\" that it occurred in an episode that did not know how to make effective use of \\"the impact of that moment\\", and she gave the episode as a whole a \\"D\\" grade. In a similar vein, James Poniewozik of Time said, \\"the beginning of the episode was a very effective 15 minutes or so of television\\", but said that was also the episode's problem. Michael Slezak of TVLine noted that the show's \\"audacity\\" allowed it \\"to tackle some of the most important issues of the day with a headiness and honesty that aren‚Äôt merely refreshing, but absolutely necessary\\", and added, \\"If I‚Äôve got any complaint with the episode, it would have to be that for a show that‚Äôs billed as a musical comedy, there certainly weren‚Äôt many laughs, and the musical interludes seemed like something of an afterthought\\". In a similar vein, Billboard Rae Votta wrote, \\"Any thoughts that Glee is, in fact, a comedy should be soundly crushed by now. It's a fantastical reality, and sometimes you laugh at that, but other times you cry.\\" Max Adler (pictured) was praised for his portrayal of Dave Karofsky in this episode The sequence where Karofsky attempts suicide was greatly praised on many levels; Slezak called it \\"as devastating as anything I‚Äôve seen on TV this year\\". Canning wrote that \\"the initial locker room scene was heartbreaking\\" and \\"Max Adler's subtle facial expressions were brilliant\\". Crystal Bell of HuffPost TV applauded Adler \\"for doing such an amazing job\\" on the suicide scene. She stated, \\"I would have preferred if Karofsky's storyline would have been the focus of the entire episode.\\" BuddyTV John Kubicek was critical of the entire storyline, and wrote that teen suicide was \\"one of those incredibly sensitive issues\\" that \\"shouldn't be taken on so directly by a light, silly musical comedy like Glee\\". VanDerWerff commented that \\"as the show got the little details of Karofsky's desperate act just right, the whole thing took on a weight\\", and singled out the scene \\"where the teachers talked about what had happened and the smash cut to Karofsky's father screaming at him to get up\\" as \\"heart- wrenching\\"; he added, \\"This was the Glee I had first loved, the Glee that could blend music and romance and comedy and highly volatile drama into one cocktail\\", though he also said that the episode had failed to \\"pay off those emotions\\". Bell declared that \\"best scene in the entire episode is when Kurt visits Karofsky in the hospital\\". Joseph Brannigan Lynch of Entertainment Weekly called it \\"one of the most touching scenes of this season\\" and \\"guileless, well-acted and eye-watering\\". Votta wrote, \\"As always, Kurt and Karofsky's scenes shine as the strongest in whichever episode they're featured.\\" MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan wrote that the episode \\"jammed in Regionals, something that used to matter\\", and did so without any \\"meaningful buildup to the competition\\". Poniewozik described the competition showdown as \\"unconnected with the episode we began watching\\", and Canning said that \\"Regionals just got in the way\\" and the performances \\"did a disservice to what was going on with Karofsky\\". Votta characterized the McKinley victory as \\"so secondary to the point of this episode that it feels completely anticlimactic\\", and VanDerWerff summarized, \\"When New Directions hoists that trophy aloft at the end, it‚Äôs about the least compelling victory for the group yet.\\" VanDerWerff said that Morrison had \\"a nice moment when he underplays the scene where he talks about how Will once contemplated suicide after getting caught cheating on a test\\", though while Lynch thought the \\"idea of the scene was nice\\", it was \\"more awkward than meaningful\\". Slezak called it \\"the worst moment of the episode\\", and criticized the \\"utter lack of context\\" regarding what else Will might have been going through. Kubicek described it as an \\"embarrassingly uncomfortable speech\\", and Will's implicit comparison of cheating on a test to the stresses of teenage homosexuality was \\"just wrong\\". VanDerWerff thought that the next part of the sequence had \\"a smallness, a realness to the scene that's kind of beautiful, really\\", and that it feels \\"like they're actual high school kids\\"; Votta commented that \\"as the kids admit all the things they are looking forward to\\", it reminds viewers why they are \\"rooting for this ragtag bunch\\". The wedding of Rachel and Finn did not excite interest among reviewers. Votta said the plot \\"continues to feel exhausting\\" and was \\"small in comparison to the other threads going on\\", and Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called it the \\"most preposterous of all\\" the storylines. VanDerWerff wrote, \\"I can buy that Finn and Rachel would be that stupid as to think getting married would perk everybody right on up\\", as could Votta, who likened it to \\"people needing to find [something] positive to focus\\" on, \\"even if that supposedly positive thing is its own train wreck\\". The Washington Post Jen Chaney wondered why the showed \\"squander[ed] the presence of Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell for the second week in a row\\". Reviewers were divided on the cliffhanger ending which showed Quinn (Agron, pictured) moments before she was in a serious automobile accident Bell lauded the \\"brilliant conversation between Quinn and Sue toward the end where Sue told Quinn that she admired her\\". Lynch though that Kurt was \\"out of line\\" when he \\"declared Quinn didn't know what it was like to truly suffer\\". He noted that she was \\"kicked out of her house and disowned by her father while pregnant\\" and added, \\"she's suffered plenty for a teenager\\". He said about the episode's final scene, which ended as the car Quinn was driving was about to be hit by a rapidly moving truck, \\"you can't help but feel sucker-punched when something like this happens\\". Flandez called it a \\"cowardly ending\\", but Canning praised the \\"good cliffhanger\\", and the \\"subtle enough\\" storytelling that did not \\"telegraph anything\\" before the closing sequence. A number of reviewers praised Sebastian's villainous ways despite his decision to abandon his blackmail attempt. Futterman noted that people had just gotten \\"used to the idea of a well-played villain on the show\\", while Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times expressed doubt about a complete conversion: \\"We'll see how long that lasts.\\" Slezak called him a \\"gem when it comes to delivering spicy one- liners\\", though he was less enthusiastic about the character's vocal solos, as was Canning, who nevertheless hailed Sebastian as a \\"fine nemesis\\". Absent more screen time for the Karofsky storyline, Bell said that the episode \\"felt more like a PSA\\" as it \\"plugged everything from The Trevor Project to Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation\\". Flandez stated that \\"this incredibly monumentous message of hope became sullied with unexpected product placements: Edible Arrangements, Peanut Butter & Co., even Sex and the City 3.\\" Sullivan was unsure whether the God Squad's plan to bring \\"an Edible Arrangement to Karofsky\\" was a \\"poorly timed joke or product placement\\", but deemed it \\"regrettable either way\\". =Music and performances= The musical performances were given a mixed response by reviewers. Canning wrote that \\"the performances of the episode didn't measure up\\" to the non-musical material, and \\"were bland and flat\\", while Chaney characterized them as \\"often lackluster\\" and added that they were part of \\"the most boring regionals competition ever\\". Hankinson, however, called it a \\"night of very solid performances\\". Chaney said that Criss \\"did a fine job\\" with the first number, \\"Cough Syrup\\", which was sung during the Karofsky suicide sequence, and gave it a \\"B\\". Futterman said Blaine \\"flawlessly deliver[ed] the vocal\\". Lynch called it a \\"chilling rendition\\" that was \\"hard to shake\\" and gave it an the same grade given by Slezak, who wrote, \\"taken on its own, Blaine's vocal was strong and passionate‚Äîperhaps better than the original\\". Hankinson said it was the \\"best\\" of the episode, and added that the \\"scene was really, really well done and carried maximum emotional punch\\". The Regionals songs by the Warblers were given a lukewarm reception. \\"Stand\\" was characterized by Lynch as \\"bouncy fun, but in a bland, forgettable sense\\", and \\"Glad You Came\\" as \\"rather unmemorable\\"; both songs received a grade. Slezak gave the two songs a \\"C+\\", and called Sebastian's lead vocals \\"as bland as a bowl of plain lasagna noodles\\", and Canning described his as \\"a weak voice that doesn't deliver a very convincing performance\\". Votta described \\"Stand\\" as \\"lackluster and mild\\", but called \\"Glad You Came\\" the \\"strongest Warbler number since Blaine's defection\\". She added, \\"It's catchy and well-choreographed, and if Sebastian's addition to the Warblers spurred them to finally take their in-Dalton dance- heavy and exuberant performance style to competition, then it's a welcome one.\\" Hankinson noted that the Warblers \\"performed two wonderful songs\\" that were new to him. Flandez and Chaney, among others, wished it were Blaine leading the Warblers, not Sebastian. Chaney wrote that the mash-up of \\"Fly\\" and \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\" was \\"an unexpectedly lovely mix\\" and gave it a \\"B+\\". Futterman said it \\"seamlessly\\" wove the two \\"into an uplifting and thematically appropriate mash-up\\", and credited Santana and Blaine with \\"an impressive job on Minaj's rap verses, while Rachel, Artie and Mercedes split tastefully understated solos\\". Slezak credited \\"solid vocals from Artie, Finn, Rachel, and Mercedes, and some not terrible rapping from Blaine and Santana\\", but he thought the number \\"lacked the epic scope you want from a Regionals showdown\\" and disliked the song \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\"; his grade was a Votta characterized the mashup as \\"just off\\" and \\"better visually than it is just to listen to the track\\". Lynch said Santana had \\"attitude to spare\\" in her rap and New Directions \\"harmonized wonderfully on this very re-listenable mash- up\\", and gave it a \\"B+\\" grade. Slezak said that the vocals on \\"What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)\\" were \\"fantastic\\" and graded the song an Flandez called the Troubletones \\"fine, fierce and fabulous\\", though Chaney wrote that the rendition was \\"a fairly routine take\\". Chaney and Slezak both wondered about the extra girls in the number, but Lynch simply said, \\"Nice to get a little Troubletones action separate from (but still part of) the New Directions\\". Lynch's grade was a \\"B\\", in part because Mercedes's voice \\"seemed strangely buried\\". Reviewers of \\"Here's to Us\\" differed on what they felt worked and didn't. Lynch said the song \\"seemed the wrong fit\\" for Rachel‚Äî\\"not horrible, but a misfire\\"‚Äîand gave it a Chaney was more critical of the song itself when she gave her \\"C+\\" grade and described it as \\"so bland\\" that it \\"had little emotional impact\\" despite Michele's \\"determined ferocity\\". Votta called the number \\"pretty\\" but said the placement of the boys in the balconies was \\"cute but not really compelling as a staged performance\\". Slezak stated that it was \\"hard to find any fault with Lea Michele's vocal performances\\" and gave it a \\"B+\\", and Futterman wrote, \\"It's bouyant [sic] and celebratory, and Rachel kills it.\\" =Chart history= Of the six singles released for the episode, five debuted on US and Canadian top 100 charts. The mash-up of \\"Fly\\" and \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\" was the highest debut in the US at number fifty-six on the Billboard Hot 100, followed by \\"Cough Syrup\\" at number sixty-five, \\"What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)\\" at number sixty-six, \\"Here's to Us\\" at number seventy-three and \\"Glad You Came\\" at number ninety.Peak chart positions for season 3 singles in the United States: \\"Cough Syrup\\", \\"Glad You Came\\", \\"Fly / I Believe I Can Fly\\", \\"(What Doesn't Kill You) Stronger\\" and \\"Here's to Us\\": The chart order was different on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100, where \\"(What Doesn't Kill You) Stronger\\" had the highest debut at number fifty-one, \\"Fly / I Believe I Can Fly\\" debuted at number fifty-nine, \\"Here's to Us\\" at number sixty-four, \\"Cough Syrup\\" at number sixty-seven and \\"Glad You Came\\" at number seventy-four. The singles also had an effect on the charting of the original versions of three of the songs. Kelly Clarkson's \\"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\\" moved back into first place from fourth on the Billboard Hot 100, and from fourth to third, equalling its previous best showing, on the Canadian Hot 100. It was beaten there by The Wanted's \\"Glad You Came\\", which was that chart's \\"greatest gainer\\", and moved from number twenty-six to number two, its highest position on the Canadian chart to date. \\"Glad You Came\\" also made a big jump in the US, and went from number eighteen to number five. \\"Cough Syrup\\" by Young the Giant debuted on both charts, at number ninety-five in the US and number eighty-two in Canada, and was the first time the group had been on the Billboard Hot 100, though the song had previously \\"bubbled under\\" the chart at number 117.

The agency is in charge of the Algerian space program. ASAL has flown five different satellites.  Objectives  ASAL targets to : * Propose to the Government the elements of a national strategy in the field of space activity and ensure their implementation; * Establish a space infrastructure to strengthen national capacities; * Implement the annual and multi annual programs to develop national space activities related to the various sectors concerned and to ensure the monitoring and evaluation; * Propose to the Government best suited to national concerns and provide space systems, on behalf of the state, their design, implementation and operation; * Provide the Government a policy of bilateral and multilateral cooperation geared to national needs; * Monitoring and evaluation of the commitments arising from the obligations of the state in regional and international agreements in the fields of space activity.  Composition  The Algerian Space Agency consists of a central structure and four operational entities that are: Center of Space Techniques (CTS), Space Applications Center (SAC), Satellite Development Center (SDC), and Telecommunications Systems Operating Center (TSOC) . International cooperation In order to achieve the objectives set out under the National Space Program, the Algerian Space Agency has carried out bilateral and multilateral cooperation actions with space forces on the one hand and emerging countries on the other And developing countries. = Bilateral cooperation = Regarding bilateral cooperation, the Algerian Space Agency signed: * 3 government cooperation agreements signed with Argentina (CONAE), France (CNES), and Ukraine (NSAU); * A non-government cooperation agreement signed with UK based Wisscom Aerospace in March 2018; * Memorandums of Understanding and Cooperation with space agencies of Russia (Roscosmos), China (CNSA), the United Kingdom (UK Space Agency), Germany (DLR), India (ISRO), Syria (GORS) and Argentina (CONAE); * In addition, 3 governmental agreements are being finalized, with Russia (Roscosmos), South Africa (SANSA) and China (CNSA). = Multilateral cooperation = Concerning multilateral cooperation, the Algerian Space Agency has undertaken the following actions:  Under the United Nations  Since the accession of Algeria to the Committee on the Pacific Uses of the Outer Space (COPUOS) of the Nations in 2002, Algeria has ratified three agreements, namely the Atmospheric Space Treaty, the Space Liability Convention and the Registration Convention. As such, the Algerian space agency actively participates regularly in the activities initiated by the United Nations Office of Space Affairs, notably through: * The presidency of the Scientific and Technical Committee under a framework of the Agency during the biennium 2008-2009; * The signing of a cooperation agreement between the Algerian Space Agency and the Office for Outer Space Affairs (UN-BAS) for the establishment in Algeria of the United Nations regional support office for disaster management And emergency response on the basis of the UN-SPIDER space tool to cover the North African sub- region. * The organization in Algiers international seminars in collaboration with the UN-DOWN: ** The use of space technologies for the prevention and management of natural disasters\\" in May 2005; ** International Space Law and National Legislation\\" in March 2006; Climate Change and Adaptation in Africa - The Role of Space Technologies in October 2007. The Algerian Space Agency also participates, on behalf of Algeria, in the various subsidiary organs of the United Nations, including the Board of Directors of the African Regional Center for Science Technologies in the Space of Nations (CRASTE). It is in this capacity that the agency was designated for the organization of the 5th session of the Board of Directors of the Center held on 26 June 2012 in Algiers.  In the African context  Algeria, represented by the Algerian space agency, is invited to all conferences and debates around the use of space technologies for sustainable development. It is as the agency: * To participate in the four African Conference on Space Science and Technology in 2005 in Abuja (Nigeria) in 2007 in Cape Town (South Africa), in 2009 in Algiers (Algeria) and in 2011 in Mombasa (Kenya), as well as At the 62nd International Astronautical Congress in 2011 in South Africa where she contributed to the animation of two African Space Leaders Round Table and From Space to Earth Challenges and Opportunities. * To organized the 3rd African Conference on Space Science and Technology for Sustainable Development 7 to 9 December 2009 in Algiers. Algeria, South Africa and Nigeria initiated in 2004, on the sidelines of the work of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) in Vienna, a constellation of satellite observation satellites (ARMC), which culminated in the signing of the ARMC agreement between Algeria, South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, on 7 December 2009 in Algiers. This constellation project aims to contribute to the knowledge and the rational management of the resources essential to the consolidation of the process of development and the fight against poverty initiated through the NEPAD through the daily coverage in images and the provision of services at a lower cost In a very short time.  In the framework of the Arab league  At the initiative of Algeria, a project for the construction of an Earth Observation Satellite (ASEO) was approved at the 17th Summit of Arab Heads of State held in Algiers in March 2005. Since its launch, this project has been the subject of several stages of discussions and validation as well technical as political and institutional.  National Space Program  Adopted by the Algerian Government on November 28, 2006 and spanning 15 years (2006‚Äì2020), with a review every 5 years, the National Space Program (NSP) is the reference instrument for space policy: it is an instrument for the government support for sustainable development and strengthening of national sovereignty. = NSP Application Action Program = Eighty-six (86) projects were selected. They mainly use the use of satellite remote sensing, satellite positioning (GPS, Glonas, Galileo in perspective), space telecommunications services, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), offering to different national sectors Powerful tools for decision-making. These projects are based on: national competences; space systems, national and international image providers and operational entities within the Algerian Space Agency.  Satellites  Alsat-1 is the first of a series of 05 microsatellite launched under the DMC (Disaster Monitoring Constellation) for the time period of 2002-2005. The objective of the mission is to provide medium resolution multispectral images for monitoring natural disasters as well as other thematic remote sensing applications. Alsat-1B is a satellite designed for agricultural and disaster monitoring. It was launched on the Indian ISRO PSLV-C35 mission on Monday, September 26, 2016. Alsat-2A was successfully launched from the Sriharikota site near Chennai (South-East of India) on 12 July 2010, as an Algerian Earth observation satellite . Since its launch, Alsat-2A has provided nearly 30,000 images. Alsat-2B is similar to Alsat-2A, but integrated in Algeria within the small satellite development center (UDPS) in Oran.

Models are ideal to learn recognizing symmetry elements in crystals. Rom√© de l'Isle The first real collections of crystal models were produced by Rom√© de l'Isle. He actually offered sets of small (ca 3 cm) models made of \\"terra cotta\\" in order to stimulate the sales of the expensive 4 volume set of his book \\"Cristallographie\\" (1783).Rom√© de l'Isle, J-B.

(2004) Crystal models: milestone in the birth of crystallography and mineralogy as sciences in Dutch Pioneers of the Earth Sciences. Ed. by R.W. Visser and J. Touret, Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen, Amsterdam The models were manufactured by his co-workers Arnould Carangeot, Lhermina and Swebach-Desfontaines, who produced numerous large sets (up to 448 models in each set). In order to exactly transfer interplanar angles from natural crystals to the terra cotta models, Carangeot invented and designed a prototype of a contact goniometer. This instrument, that proved to be an invaluable tool in geometric crystallography, enabled the measurement of interplanar angles with a precision of about half a degree. Teylers Museum in Haarlem has a complete set of these terracotta models that were bought in Paris (in 1785) by Martin van Marum, the first director of the museum. After over 200 years, this collection is still complete and in perfect condition at Teylers Museum. Ren√© Just Ha√ºy Almost two decades later, Ren√© Just Ha√ºy introduced wooden crystal models to illustrate the two-dimensional drawings in the atlas volume of his \\"Trait√© de Min√©ralogie\\" (1801).Ha√ºy, R.J. (1801) Trait√© de Min√©ralogie. 5 Vols. Paris For the production of crystal models, wood appeared to be much more convenient than clay. Especially pear wood permitted getting smooth faces, sharp edges and accurate dihedral angles required for the production of these three-dimensional objects. In general, the angular accuracy was very high and some models, especially those illustrating crystal twins and Ha√ºy's figures of decrement, still appear as masterpieces of fine woodwork and carving. Skilful craftsmen such as Pleuvin, Beloeuf and Lambotin (to name only a few) became specialists in this field and the models they offered were highly esteemed. Between 1802‚Äì1804, Martin van Marum bought 597 of these pear wood models, 565 of these are still present in the collection of Teylers Museum. Each model is labeled, mentioning a number and the name of the crystal form. This set is the most complete collection of Ha√ºy crystal models that still survives. That Van Marum was able to acquire such a unique collection was due to his networking. Van Marum allowed Ha√ºy as a member of the Hollandsche Maatschappij, a nomination to which Ha√ºy attached great value. Ha√ºy mentioned this membership in all of his publications. After their introduction by Rom√© de l'Isle and Ha√ºy, crystal models were increasingly demanded both by scholars for teaching purposes as well as by mineral collectors. The quality of the models improved due to the technical progress in their production. Several mineralogists and crystallographers started designing their own series of models. Although pear wood kept a prominent place, models were also manufactured using materials like plaster, cast iron, lead, brass, glass, porcelain, cardboard, etc.Schuh, Curtis (2007) Mineralogy & Crystallography: On the history of these sciences from beginnings through 1919. Tucson, Arizona The Krantz Company In 1833, Adam August Krantz (who studied pharmacy and later \\"Geognosie\\" at the Bergakademie Freiberg) founded the Krantz company in Bonn. Four years later, Krantz moved to Berlin and sold minerals, fossils, rocks and basically acquired a monopoly in the production of crystal models made of pear wood or walnut. Ever since its foundation, the firm was always in contact with renowned scientists and important collectors. Hence in 1880, Krantz proposed a series of 743 pear wood models compiled for teaching purposes by the crystallographer Paul Groth.Burchard, U. (1994, 1996) The P. Groth & F.

At the onset of the 20th century, Friedrich Krantz (a nephew of August Krantz, with a degree in mineralogy) supported by his teacher the crystallographer Carl Hintze, offered a collection of 928 models including most of the Groth models. Later, and along with many other productions, a Dana collection of 282 models was manufactured. Krantz offered a choice of collections of wooden models in different sizes (5, 10, 15‚Äì25 cm). In addition, he sold a variety of glass models having the crystallographic axes illustrated by colored silk threads or with the holohedral form made of cardboard inside. Also available were models in massive cut and polished glass (colored and uncolored), cardboard models, wire crystal models, crystal lattice models, models with rotating parts, etc. Over the years, Krantz published numerous detailed catalogues of the collections he offered; they constitute a precious documentation.Krantz F.

The program was broadcast from 2012 to 2016, and normally aired on weekend mornings. Harris-Perry had previously been a contributor and guest host for the network before the show was announced. The first episode debuted on February 18, 2012. During the running of the show, Melissa Harris-Perry commuted from North Carolina to New York City on the weekends to host, while she remained a professor at Wake Forest University. In February 2016, the future of the show became unclear as the result of the eponymous host going on strike with MSNBC, because she says MSNBC has \\"silenced\\" the show. On February 28, 2016, MSNBC announced that they had cancelled Melissa Harris-Perry after 4 years on the air. Format According to MSNBC, the program features panel discussions focusing on national politics while exploring the African-American \\"intersections of culture, art and community\\". The show's two-hour running time allows for a more diverse pool of guests, often new to being on-air compared to typical cable news programs. In addition, since the show airs on weekends, Harris- Perry says it has \\"a little bit more breathing room\\" to respond to the weekly news cycle. Harris-Perry encourages viewers to interact with the show via Twitter using the #nerdland hashtag, which she uses to describe an occasional destination for its topic field and intensity of discourse. The shows places a strong emphasis on pop culture in an effort to expand the idea of what is considered \\"political\\". Instead of political pundits, Harris-Perry often invites academics, activist Hollywood stars, struggling actresses, makeup ladies, and underrepresented voices as guests. In addition, she often discusses politics outside the beltway, including politics of the South. History Melissa Harris-Perry. Prior to the show's announcement, Melissa Harris-Perry had been appearing frequently as a political analyst on MSNBC. She had also guest-hosted prime-time programs The Rachel Maddow Show and The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell for the network. In January 2012, MSNBC announced that she would be hosting her own program as part of the network's weekend lineup. Harris-Perry credited Rachel Maddow for raising her profile on the network by making her a regular guest on The Rachel Maddow Show and then a guest host for the program. MSNBC president Phil Griffin described an episode of Maddow which she hosted in the summer of 2011 as \\"[p]henomenal honestly. Just jaw-dropping.\\" Harris-Perry added: \\"more importantly, is the fact that Rachel exists that makes this possible. That she demonstrated so clearly that there is a ratings bonanza to be had for smart, a young woman who is not primarily there because she's adorable but is rather there because she is brilliant and has something to say about the news.\\" Harris-Perry remained a professor of political science at Wake Forest University and commuted to New York City every weekend to host the program. She remarked that, professionally, she is a \\"professor first\\", and accepted the opportunity to host the program because it didn't require her to give up teaching. Nonetheless, she admitted that switching to the academic-broadcaster schedule \\"really did blow up [her] entire life.\\" The show was originally scheduled to launch on February 4, 2012. The program's debut was pushed back two weeks, and the first episode aired on February 18. During the show's run, Harris-Perry was one of the few African American women who had regular positions in cable news. She said she took her position as host \\"very seriously\\", and hoped to emulate other national figures such as Gwen Ifill and Soledad O'Brien. On December 29, 2013 a picture was shown of former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his extended family. Romney was holding his adopted African-American grandchild. Harris-Perry and her guests, including actress Pia Glenn and comedian Dean Obeidallah, joked about coming up with captions for the photo. Glenn sang out, \\"One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn‚Äôt the same.\\" Obeidallah said, \\"It sums up the diversity of the Republican Party and the Republican National Committee, where they have the whole convention and they find the one black person.\\" Afterwards, Harris-Perry apologized in a series of Tweets and on msnbc.com, stating, \\"Without reservation or qualification, I apologize to the Romney family and to all families built on loving transracial adoptions\\". Romney replied, \\"I think it‚Äôs a heartfelt apology. I think for that reason, we hold no ill will whatsoever\\". = Cancellation = On February 26, 2016, Harris- Perry sent an email to the staff of the TV show stating that she would not be returning to host the show that weekend and possibly for the foreseeable future. She wrote that she felt the executives at MSNBC were silencing her show due to the numerous preemptions for special coverage of the 2016 presidential election and expressed frustration that she was being shut out of MSNBC's on-air coverage despite being highly qualified. She said that the show was scheduled to come back in its regular time slot, but there would be more time devoted to top news stories and breaking news rather than her team's own editorial content. Harris-Perry stated that she believed the only reason MSNBC was bringing the show back on air was due to people's comments on her notable absences. She wrote: On February 28, 2016, MSNBC announced that the show had been cancelled. Reception Frances Martel of Mediaite noted Melissa Harris- Perrys discussion of cultural issues, and said the show's first episode \\"brought to the table conversations that are as important as they are interesting and achieved the most difficult thing in cable news today: it is unique.\\" Ron Simon, a curator of TV and radio at the Paley Center for Media, said the show is a \\"nice counterpoint to the older, male-dominated shows you see on the weekends\\" and that Harris-Perry's influence may help open up the cable news landscape to a \\"multiplicity of voices\\". According to ratings released in May 2012, the program showed \\"more growth in the time period than all other cable news programs combined,\\" and was #1 in its time slot with ages 18‚Äì34.Merrill Knox, \\"May 2012 Ratings: MSNBC Down Double Digits\\", TV Newser, May. 30, 2012.

The park is named after for local newspaper industrialist, George F. McCulloch, who gave the 118 acres of land to the city for a park in 1892. The park later consisted of a baseball field that hosted two professional teams; the Muncie Fruit Jars and the Muncie Reds. The park also served as the spring training home of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1943‚Äì1945. Baseball In , Muncie fielded its first professional baseball team, the Muncie Fruit Jars, who played in the Interstate Association. The team played again in season in the Ohio‚ÄìIndiana League which folded that season, on June 8, with the team in last place. Over the next two decades, McCulloch Park was home to several local semi-pro clubs. In 1931 a permanent wooden grandstand was built by the city. During the 1930s, several major league teams visited the ballpark. On one notable occasion, the St. Louis Browns lost a game to one of Muncie's local teams. In , the Pittsburgh Pirates traveled to Muncie for the club's spring training session. During this time, the United States was fighting in World War II. The Pirates' selection of Muncie was part of an effort by Major League Baseball to reduce team travel expenses, due to the lower revenues brought about by the war. The 1943 Pirates were managed Frank Frisch and Honus Wagner, both men were Hall of Famers. Their presence helped the team establish a fanbase in Muncie. During the Pirates' stay, other major league teams traveled to McCulloch Park to play them. Rudy York, of the Detroit Tigers, is credited for hitting the longest home run out of the Park. Once the war ended, the Pirates ended their spring training relationship with Muncie. However, the Cincinnati Reds established a minor league affiliate in the city, called the Muncie Reds. The Reds played at McCulloch Park from to . Future Cincinnati Reds standouts, Joe Nuxhall and Wally Post, played for Muncie in 1947 and they were among six Muncie Reds players who would later play in the majors. The Reds disbanded in 1950 and the field was once again used only by amateur and semi-pro clubs. Today On Friday, June 13, 1952, a fire completely destroyed the Park's grandstand. The grandstand was never replaced, however the field was refurbished and has been maintained since. The park is still in operation today. It is accessible to the community and includes playgrounds, a disc golf course, a soap box derby track, basketball courts, baseball fields, picnic areas, a park lodge rental facility, restrooms, and fishing/boating areas.

It had a negative impact on the reputation of the Sri Lankan government and the Sri Lanka Armed Forces. The documentary Channel 4 claimed that the government was responsible for targeted shelling of civilians, extrajudicial executions of prisoners and rape, sexual assault and murder of female LTTE fighters. The presenter Jon Snow claimed that the government was responsible for the deaths of as many as 40,000 civilians towards the end of the war. He went so far as to claim that \\"[o]nce or twice in a reporting lifetime, a journalist is allowed by events to participate in a project that can affect history. The film...is a painful and complex team achievement...which...pieced together an account of what happened in the closing weeks of Sri Lanka‚Äôs civil war.\\" The resulting backlash prompted the Sri Lankan government to produce its own documentary, highlighting the alleged inaccuracies and the facts that may have been potentially missed or concealed by the producers of the Channel 4 documentary. Special screenings A special screening of the documentary Lies Agreed Upon was held at the United States Congress, at a gathering hosted by the Congressional Caucus on Sri Lanka and Sri Lankan Americans on 2 November 2011. The screening included a panel discussion of Sri Lanka's 26-year conflict. The event was attended by a representative gathering including congressional representatives, NGOs, human rights groups, congressional staff members, professionals and members of the Sri Lankan community. The documentary Lies Agreed Upon was also screened at the Attlee Suite, Portcullis House of the British parliament on 12 October 2011. The event was organized by the Sri Lanka High Commission in London. It was followed by a dialogue with Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha, and Sir Peter Heap, Chairman, Friends of Sri Lanka group in the European Parliament. The audience consisted of British parliamentarians, representatives from academia, some media representatives including from Channel 4, and a cross-section of the Sri Lankan Diaspora. Another screening was held at the Dag Hammarskjold Auditorium of United Nations Headquarters, at the invitation of the president of the United Nations Correspondents Association, on 6 September 2011. The documentary Lies Agreed Upon was screened at the Parliament of New Zealand (Beehive) on 28 September 2011. The session was organized by the United Sri Lanka Association in New Zealand. It was also screened at a side event titled \\"Sri Lanka - Humanitarian Operation: A Factual Analysis\\", organized on the margins of the 18th session of United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva by the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in Geneva. The President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed speaking at the event urged the international community to support the reconciliation process being implemented in Sri Lanka. A cross section of member countries of the Human Rights Council, INGOs and civil society organizations participated in this event. Content =Rebuttal of Sri Lanka's Killing Fields= The documentary offered counter arguments for a number of allegations made by the Channel 4 documentary. Introduction The documentary Lies Agreed Upon claimed that the title used by Channel 4, Killing Fields, was specifically drawn up to evoke memories of the Khmer Rouge regime, which controlled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. In addition, Channel 4 did not claim ownership of any of the footage, facts, figures, faces or names that it broadcast. According to Lies Agreed Upon the presenter of the Sri Lanka's Killing Fields constantly referred to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the defeated party of the Sri Lankan Civil War, as \\"army\\", whereas it did not have any legitimate authority over the territory it controlled and was proscribed as a terrorist organization by 32 countries. United Nations office demonstration At the very beginning of the Channel 4 documentary, it was shown that a footage of a protest in front of the United Nations office in Kilinochchi. The presenter claimed \\"News that the UN international staff leaving, spread quickly, and crowds of frightened Tamil civilians besieged the UN base..\\". Lies Agreed Upon refuted the claim providing with interviews of Tamil civilians who actually took part in the demonstration. Those civilians described that the demonstration was not at all spontaneous, but was organized by the LTTE. One person claimed that Kalaiyvan, the LTTE leader of Kilinochchi, summoned the heads of all 16 trade associations in the district and instructed them to stage the protest at the 150th milestone at Arasankatty, where the UN office was located. Another person claimed that people had no say about such matters when the area was under LTTE control. \\"We must do as told. If they ask, we have to open, if they ask to close we must close. If we do not obey we will have to stop doing our business..\\". The government documentary also alleged that the Channel 4 documentary tried to imply, the residents of Vanni were left with no refuge by the abandoning of the UN office. Benjamin Dix, a British UN worker, quite emotionally stated that \\"It was their greatest hour of need. They had an army sitting on the doorstep...and we drove out. That was ...a real sense of abandonment of these people\\". But according to the government version of the sequence of events, UN staff of about 200 and their families continued to serve in the area until the end. Sri Lanka's Killing Fields also failed to mention that the Tamil UN staffers and their families had been held hostage by the LTTE. As the battle came closer to the end, 9 UN staffers were forcibly recruited by the LTTE for their auxiliary forces, the government documentary added. Casualty figures According to the Channel 4 documentary, \\"..the deaths of as many as 40,000 people..possibly far more..\\" could have occurred by the end of the war. Refuting this claim, Lies Agreed Upon stated that Gordon Weiss, the former UN spokesman based on Colombo, who commented on high casualty rates, was asked to leave by the Government of Sri Lanka on 12 May 2009. By this time, the UN had an official estimate of about 7,000 casualties during the final 4 months of war. One year after his resignation, Weiss came up with a figure of 10,000 to 40,000 casualties, at a time when he was involved in promoting his upcoming book, The Cage. But the UN, which treated Weiss as a junior official, specifically disassociated itself from the comment. The documentary Lies Agreed Upon also claimed that all the reports of deaths during the final stages of the war had come from either the LTTE media, or the 4 government doctors who were held hostage by the LTTE. Credibility of Vany Kumar Lies Agreed Upon also raised questions about the credibility of Vany Kumar, the central witness of the Channel 4 documentary. Jon Snow of Channel 4 introduced herself as \\"a young English Tamil woman, who had left London to spend 6 months with [her] relatives in Sri Lanka\\". She appeared on 10 separate occasions in the program, and was presented as an \\"independent witness\\" who had firsthand experience of the final days of war. But refuting the Channel 4 claims, the government documentary asserted that she had worked as a full-time and active member of an LTTE terrorist cell in London. Government investigations had revealed that Vany Kumar, who had gone by at least 4 different names including Dr. Tamilvani, Damilvany Kumar and Damilvany Gananakumar, arrived in Sri Lanka on 28 February 2008. She had worked as the woman coordinator of the UK Tamil Youth Organization (TYO), an LTTE front organization. Documentary \\"Lies Agreed Upon\\" claimed, citing one of her former colleagues, Navaratnam Prabhakaran alias Sendramalar, that after Kumar's arrival in Vanni, she underwent one month of weapons training and was enlisted under Sothiya regiment of LTTE. She had also possessed a dog tag with a cardre number issued by the Sothiya regiment, and a cyanide capsule. She had also worked for the Castro branch of the LTTE international wing. According to the government documentary, by April 2009, when the LTTE was rapidly losing ground to the Sri Lankan Army she joined the medical facility under Dr. Shanmugaraja, a government doctor worked inside LTTE held area, and served there until 15 May 2009. Shells fallen on medical facilities Another key interviewee of the Channel 4 documentary, Gordon Weiss, who appeared on eight separate video clips of the program, alleged that there had been 65 instances of shelling on hospitals and makeshift medical facilities. According to the documentary Lies Agreed Upon, refuting these claims, Dr. Shanmugaraja said that he could only remember four instances of shelling; one on Vallipuram hospital, one on Puthukkudiyiruppu hospital, one on Mullivaikkal West makeshift hospital and one on Mullivaikkal East makeshift hospital. The doctor strongly denied and condemned Weiss's claim that he requested the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) not to provide GPS coordinates of the medical facilities to the Sri Lankan Army. Giving an interview to the Lies Agreed Upon, Dr. Sivapalan, medical officer of Chavakacheri and former medical officer - Vanni, claimed that LTTE had its commanding centres from within 100 metres of Puthukkudiyiruppu hospital, in which 2 artillery shells had fallen in February 2009. He also asserted that LTTE used heavy artillery as close as possible to the hospitals. Corpse of Isaipriya In one of the alleged \\"trophy videos\\" aired by Channel 4, the dead body of an LTTE female cardre named Isaipriya was shown. Narrator described her an LTTE non- combatant who sang songs glorifying suicide bombing. But refuting the Channel 4 assertion, the government documentary claimed that she was a high-profile LTTE cardre, tasked to handle the motivation of suicide Black Tigers. According to the government, disrobing dead LTTE militants was a part of the standard operating procedure adopted by Sri Lankan military, as well as many armies fighting terrorism, since it is necessary for searching hidden weapons, suicide jackets and documents. The documentary Lies Agreed Upon cited Death of Osama bin Laden as an instance for the use of this practice. Corpse of Ramesh Sri Lanka's Killing Fields also showed the corpse of T. Thurairajasingham alias Col. Ramesh, a senior leader of LTTE, and the overall military commander of Eastern province, suggesting that he had been killed after being captured. The documentary Lies Agreed Upon contained a brief description of the massacres he has given leadership to, including the Kattankudy mosque massacre, which left 147 Muslim civilians who had knelt for prayer, killed on the spot, Habarana bus massacre which left 127 passengers dead, and Aranthalawa Massacre which left 35 Buddhist monks dead. The government documentary criticized the Sri Lanka's Killing Fields for failing to mention those atrocties which had been carried out under the supervision of Col. Ramesh. State of IDP camps Jon Snow's description of the Sri Lankan IDP camps was that \\"[they] were brutal places, where stories of rape, violence and disappearances were rife\\". Contradicting the Channel 4 claims, Lies Agreed Upon featured a number of interviews with present and past female IDPs who said that they were treated well by the Army. They did not agree with the claims that rape, violence and disappearance were rife inside those camps. Execution videos Commenting on the alleged \\"trophy videos\\" featuring blindfilded LTTE cardres killed by men in military uniforms, the presenter said that \\"who killed whom, this much is known, over 11,000 LTTE cardre and their families surrendered to the Army. None of them were harmed...\\" The government documentary vehemently rejected the authenticity of these videos, alleging that those were stage-managed. =Facts and figures= Casualty figures The documentary Lies Agreed Upon estimated the number of total casualties in the Vanni area during the final stages of the war, using approximate number of persons lived in 2008 and the number of people came out of the region after the Sri Lankan armed forces took control of it in May 2009. It quoted several sources for the number of people lived in the region by late 2008. * United Nations residential coordinator - 180,000 * Centre for Humanitarian Agencies (UNOCHA) - 150,000 * United Nations-Under Secretary at United Nations Security Council - 190,000 * World Food Programme - 230,000 * INGO and UN agencies in January - 250,000 * Government Agent in Vanni - 305,000 It claimed that even the figure of around 300,000 people, which was generally accepted by the end of the war, too was inflated by the LTTE to secure greater volumes of food and medical supplies from the government. The total number of registered persons in the IDP cams was 293,800. Going with the 300,000 figure and taking into account the 4,600 LTTE cadre killed in combat, the total number of persons accounted for, was 99.46%. Rest of the casualties also includes the civilians died in crossfire, those who were shot dead by the LTTE as they tried to flee, and those who fled the country at the end of the war using sea routes. Therefore, the documentary concluded that the civilian casualty figure of 40,000 was not only improbable, but also impossible. =Special footage= The documentary Lies Agreed Upon produced several video clips that had allegedly been found in possession of a dead LTTE cardre, showing LTTE persons firing pedal guns in civilian clothes. It also included another footage showing LTTE suicide bomber Sujatha Vagawanam detonating herself in an attempt to kill Sri Lankan minister Douglas Devananda. It also showed aerial footage taken by Sri Lanka Air Force unmanned aerial vehicles on 21 April 2009, depicting LTTE cadres shooting at Tamil civilians trying to escape from the Tiger held area. An LTTE suicide attack on a civilian receiving centre on 9 February 2009 which left 17 people dead was also featured in the documentary. =Interviews= Government doctors The 4 government doctors who worked at the LTTE controlled territory during the final days of the war, giving interviews to the documentary Lies Agreed Upon, recanted their earlier statements on the number of deaths. Dr, Sathiyamoorthy, medical superintend of the Vavuniya General hospital, and former RDHS of Kilinochchi stated \\"Sometimes they [LTTE] are coming with a list of casualty numbers and dead numbers and they ask [us] to give [the] details..\\". Dr. Shanmugaraja, the medical officer (anesthesia) of Teaching Hospital, Jaffna and former RDHS of Mullaitivu said that \\"When LTTE asked me to put the figure as 1,000, I said that it is totally unacceptable and that I have not gone and seen such numbers\\". Documentary Lies Agreed Upon claimed, he also refuted the claims of Channel 4 witness Vany Kumar, who alleged that he cut off the leg of a 6-year-old boy without giving local anesthetic, (laughingly) saying \\"We did not conduct any sort of surgery without giving anesthesia. That would've killed the boy\\". According to the documentary Lies Agreed Upon, Dr. Sivapalan said that LTTE controlled Tamil Eelam Administrative Service took over a major portion of food and medical items that had been sent by the government for the use of civilians in the area. He went into elaborate that he once appealed to the LTTE leader Pulidevan to release to innocent Tamil civilians who had been forcibly held by the LTTE. They did not heed his calls. \\"They said they are the protectors of Tamils, but at last they had started to fire at people, and they killed a lot of civilians. I saw that...\\", the doctor added. Residents of Vanni A resident of Kilinochchi recalled his memories of the period, giving an interview to Lies Agreed Upon, saying \\"people were desperate and were taking every effort to escape. I saw people falling dead due to the LTTE gunfire while attempting to escape. Many were fleeing during the midnight and attempting to cross the lagoon [Nandikadal Lagoon] were shot at point-blank range. I saw two bodies of youngsters shot dead and dragged near the Pillayar Kovil at Mathalan near the beach...\\" Among the residents of Vanni, who were forcibly held by the LTTE, was Sathasivam Kanagaratnam, a former Tamil National Alliance Mullaitivu District MP. He described his experience with the producers of the documentary: \\"I witnessed the LTTE extensively engaged in the forcible recruitment of the underaged children who were given a week's arms training and pushed to the battlefront.. I saw how children were nabbed while parents were wailing..\\" Ex-LTTEers and family members Ex-LTTE members who had been preparing for their GCE Advanced Level examinations and those who were undergoing vocational training, had been featured in the documentary. Kuchadarshini Arumeinadan, an ex-LTTE combatant who surrendred to the Sri Lanka Army 58 Division, who had also been featured on a footage, speaking with the division commander Major general Shavendra Silva on the day of her surrender, described that although she had feared for her life at that day, she had not been harmed, but was treated humanely. Sasirekha, the wife of the former leader of the LTTE political wing S. P. Thamilselvan, giving an interview to the documentary told that she had been treated well by the Army. She said she had been treated for a growing abdominal pain at the National hospital, Colombo and her children attend an international school in Colombo. She also said she has no plans to migrate to India or UK, to live the rest of her life. Sathyadevi, the wife of the leader of the Sea Tigers, Thillaiyampalam Sivanesan alias Soosai, said that she never thought the government would treat them this well. Although she and her family were depressed initially, their fears turned out to be untrue. Velayutham Dayanidhi alias Daya Master, the head of the media division of LTTE, giving an interview to the \\"Lies Agreed Upon\\", revealed that \\"Whenever a Tamil civilian or any other individual from a different Tamil fraction was caught defying LTTE rules, the LTTE used to shoot them wearing Army uniforms. And often LTTE cardres wearing uniforms similar to the military attacked both Sinhalese and Tamil villages. Tamil villages were attacked in-order to create fear psychos among the civilians towards the Army.\\" The ex-LTTE cadre who was in charge of the prison at Victor base in Vallimulli, was also featured revealing that 26 military prisoners (18 Army, 8 Navy) were massacred on orders of Prabhakaran on 16 January 2009. =Continued operations of LTTE= The documentary Lies Agreed Upon concluded with a brief description of the continued operations and the present administrative structure of the LTTE. A former cardre of the LTTE international wing revealed that, Veerakathy Manivannam alias Castro, the head of the LTTE international wing, was the one who formed Tamil Youth Organizations (TYOs) in the Western countries with a huge Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora. This was done in-order to reach the international community without much problem, as most of the TYO members were born and bred there. People who worked earlier in those countries were not effective because they weren't familiar with their system. According to the documentary, Father S. J. Emmanuel, President of the Global Tamil Forum made 2 or 3 visits to Sri Lanka to meet with Castro and once he conducted classes at the Nathan base on how to deal with the diaspora from Vanni. The cardre also claimed that TNA parliamentarian M. K. Eelaventhan lialised for the Father Emmanuel's visits. The documentary revealed details of the persons who run the global network of the defeated LTTE outfit; Perinpanayagam Sivaparan alias Nediyavan of the Tamil Eelam People's Alliance (TEPA) in Norway, Suren Surendiran of British Tamils Forum (BTF), Father S. J. Emmanuel of Global Tamil Forum (GTF), Visvanathan Rudrakumaran of Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) and Sekarapillai Vinayagamoorthy alias Kathirgamathamby Arivazhagan alias Vinayagam, a former senior LTTE intelligence leader. Criticism Criticism of Lies Agreed Upon was particularly based on the apparent non-independent status of some of its witnesses. The LTTE cadres interviewed, had trials been pending at the time of their interview. Thus it would make them unlikely to make any statement not in favour of the Sri Lankan government. And the 4 government doctors who provided details of the conditions in the LTTE held area during the final stages of the war, had been detained by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of Sri Lanka Police after they escaped the clutches of LTTE. Less than two months after they gave a press conference, recanting their earlier statements, the doctors were released, and reinstated in their profession. Contradicting the documentary's characterization of IDP camps, V. Anandasangaree, the leader of the Tamil United Liberation Front and an outspoken critic of LTTE claimed that \\"the conditions were 'good' in some camps and 'horrible' in many others\\" \\"Health, water and sanitation situation is horrible. Many people have skin diseases as they don't get a chance to have a shower for days because of water shortage. Pregnant mothers and newborn babies go through a harrowing time in the camps due to scorching heat\\". Former Chief Justice, Sarath N. Silva also pointed out the abysmal conditions in some camps. The casualty figures also came under criticism, referring to government's claims in April 2009 that only 70,000 people were in the LTTE controlled territory. 37,000 people had fled the areas by then, leaving more than 185,000 people underestimated as when they came out of the area. Reaction International Crisis Group, making a statement on the documentary, said that \\"nothing in the program that disproves, and little that even challenges directly, the many specific credible allegations ‚Äì including those in the report of the UN Secretary-General‚Äôs panel of experts on accountability ‚Äì that in 2009 the government shelled Tamil civilian concentrations and hospitals, executed surrendering cadres and LTTE political leaders, and failed to provide adequate humanitarian supplies to the civilian population\\". However it also noted that \\"The government‚Äôs film makes clear that so long as campaigners for justice and peace in the Tamil diaspora do not clearly recognise the crimes of the LTTE and clearly repudiate their violent forms of militant struggle, and the damage it did to all communities in Sri Lanka, their efforts towards justice will remain weak\\". Aftermath Sri Lanka Ministry of Defence, in February 2012 released a follow up to the documentary, named Ruthless. This documentary focused on two incidents during the final stages of war; the attack on St. Mary's Church at Valayanamadam in March 2009 and abduction of 600 under-aged children who were taking refuge there, and detonation of buses filled with injured LTTE cardres by the LTTE itself.

They are relatively large caprellids, reaching a maximum length of . They are sexually dimorphic, with the males usually being much larger than the females. They are characterized by their \\"hairy\\" first and second thoracic segments and the rows of spines on their bodies. Body color ranges from green to red to blue, depending on the environment. They are omnivorous highly adaptable opportunistic feeders. In turn, they provide a valuable food source for fish, crabs, and other larger predators. They are usually found in dense colonies attached to submerged man-made structures, floating seaweed, and other organisms. C. mutica are native to shallow protected bodies of water in the Sea of Japan. In as little as 40 years, they have become an invasive species in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and along the coasts of New Zealand. They are believed to have been accidentally introduced to these areas through the global maritime traffic and aquaculture. Outside of their native range, C. mutica are often exclusively synanthropic, being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity. Their ecological and economic impact as an invasive species is unknown, but they pose a serious threat to native populations of skeleton shrimp in the affected areas. Description Like all caprellid amphipods, Caprella mutica are characterized by slender bodies and elongated appendages. Their skeletal appearance gives rise to the common names of \\"skeleton shrimp\\" or \\"ghost shrimp\\", and, coupled with their distinctive upright feeding posture, give them a striking resemblance to stick insects and \\"starved praying mantises\\". C. mutica vary in coloration from translucent pale green, brown, cream, orange, deep red, purple, and even turquoise, depending on the substrate they are found in. The brood pouches of the females are speckled with red spots. A relatively large amphipod, C. mutica are sexually dimorphic with males considerably larger than females. Males average at a length of , though specimens have been recorded to reach in length. Females, on the other hand, average at only long. The body can be divided into three parts ‚Äì the cephalon (head), the pereon (thorax), and the abdomen. The pereon comprises most of the length of the body. It is divided into seven segments known as pereonites. The rounded and smooth cephalon is fused to the first pereonite; while the highly reduced and almost invisible abdomen is attached to the posterior of the seventh pereonite. In males the first two pereonites are elongated, with the second pereonite being the longest of all the pereonites. They are densely covered with long setae (bristles), giving them a hairy appearance. The second pereonite also has two to three pairs of spines on the back, with an additional two pairs at the sides near the base of the limbs. The remaining pereonites (third to seventh) lack the dense setae of the first two pereonites. The third pereonite has seven pairs of spines at the back while the fourth pereonite has eight pairs. Both have three to seven pairs of spines near the base of the gills. The fifth pereonite has five pairs of back spines and a pair of spines at the sides. The sixth and seventh pereonites each have two pairs of back spines, situated at their centers and near the posterior. Females differ from males in having much shorter pereonites which lack the dense covering of setae. The cephalon and first pereonite also possess a single pair of spines each, though they can sometimes be absent. Morphology of Caprella mutica (male) Like other crustaceans, C. mutica possess two pairs of antennae, with the first (outer) pair more than half the total length of the body. The segments of the peduncles (base) are three times as long as the flagellae (\\"whips\\" at the ends of the antennae). The flagellae have 22 segments each. The second (inner) pair of antennae are less than half the length of the first. They possess two rows of long setae on the ventral surfaces of the segments of their peduncles. Mandibles and maxillae are present at the anterior ventral surface of the cephalon. Maxillipeds, a modified pair of appendages, also serve as accessory mouthparts. The appendages that arise from pereonites are known as pereopods. The first two pairs of pereopods are highly modified raptorial grasping appendages known as gnathopods. They somewhat resemble the arms of praying mantises. The segments of the gnathopods can be divided into two parts which fold into each other: the propodus (plural: propodi, \\"forelimb\\") and the tipmost segment known as the dactylus (plural: dactyli, \\"finger\\"). The first pair of gnathopods are considerably smaller than the second pair and arise close to the maxillipeds. The inside margins of the propodi possess two spines. Both the propodi and dactyli have serrated inner edges. The second pair of gnathopods are very large with two large spines on the middle and upper edges of the inside margin of the palm of the propodi. The upper spine is known as the \\"poison spine\\" or \\"poison tooth\\" and may be of the same size or much larger than the lower spine (the \\"closing spine\\"). Despite the name, it remains unclear if the poison spine is indeed venomous, though they are perfectly capable of inflicting potentially lethal injuries on small organisms. Recent studies have associated the spines with pores that lead to possible toxin-producing glands. Their dactyli are powerful and curved into a scimitar-like shape. The second pair of gnathopods are densely covered in hair-like setae while the first pair only has setae on the posterior margins. The third and fourth pereopods are absent. In their place are two pairs of elongated oval gills arising from the third and fourth pereonites, respectively. In mature females, two brood pouches also develop in the third and fourth pereonites. These are formed by oostegites ‚Äì platelike expansions from the basal segments (coxae) of the appendages. The fifth to seventh pereopods function as clasping appendages. They all have propodi with two spines on their inside margins. The seventh pair of pereopods are the longest of the three pairs, followed by the sixth pereopod pair and the fifth pereopod pair. C. mutica closely resemble Caprella acanthogaster, also a native of East Asian waters. It may be difficult to distinguish the two species, particularly since Caprella mutica can exhibit considerable morphological variations among males. C. mutica can only be reliably differentiated by their setose first and second pereonites (smooth in C. acanthogaster), as well as the elongated oval shape of their gills (linear in C. acanthogaster). Taxonomy and nomenclature Caprella mutica were first described in 1935 by A. Schurin from specimens collected from the Peter the Great Gulf in the Sea of Japan. It belongs to the genus Caprella in the subfamily Caprellinae of the family Caprellidae, a group of highly specialized amphipods commonly known as skeleton shrimp. Caprellids are classified under the superfamily Caprelloidea of the infraorder Caprellida. C. mutica are known as koshitoge-warekara (\\"spine-waist skeleton shrimp\\") in Japanese. In the Netherlands and Belgium, where the first invasive populations of C. mutica in Europe were discovered, they are known as machospookkreeftje in Flemish (literally \\"macho ghost shrimp\\"). The name is derived from the junior synonym (invalid name) Caprella macho, applied in 1995 to the species by Dirk Platvoet et al. who initially believed they were a different species. \\"Macho\\" is a humorous reference to the characteristic \\"hairy chests\\" of the males of C. mutica. Caprella acanthogaster humboldtiensis, another invalid name of the species, was first applied to misidentified specimens of C. mutica recovered from Humboldt Bay, California by Donald M. Martin in 1977. Some specimens collected from the Firth of Clyde, Scotland in 1999 were also initially misidentified as Caprella tuberculata, but have since been determined to be introduced C. mutica. Ecology and biology Caprella mutica inhabit shallow protected marine bodies of water. They can often be found in dense colonies attached to submerged artificial structures, marine macroalgae, and other organisms. They are primarily omnivorous detritivores, but can adapt to other feeding methods depending on food availability. They are preyed upon by fish, crabs, and several other predators. C. mutica are generally found in temperate and subarctic regions. They can not tolerate water temperatures higher than . They also die within five minutes if exposed to water temperatures of . On the lower end, they can survive temperatures lower than , but are rendered immobile if not altogether in a state of suspended animation. Salinity tolerance of C. mutica does not go below 15 psu, and they are unable to survive in freshwater habitats. However, in their native habitats, it has been observed that they can survive salinities as low as 11 psu. They are also sensitive to exposure to air, and will die within an hour if taken out of the water. C. mutica reproduce all throughout the year, with peak seasons in the summer months. Males are highly aggressive and exhibit sexual competition over the smaller females. The eggs, which average at 40 per female,Ito A, Aoki MN, Yahata K, Wada H.

Their average lifespan in laboratory conditions is 68.8 days for males and 82 days for females. =Habitat= In their native habitat, Caprella mutica are found in the infralittoral (or neritic) and littoral zones of sheltered bodies of water to a depth of about . They may spend their entire lives clinging to a substrate in an upright position. These substrates are typically floating with filamentous, leafy, branching, or turf-like structures of the same color as their body for camouflage as well as transportation. C. mutica are poor swimmers and move around predominantly in an undulating inchworm-like fashion, using their posterior pereopods and gnathopods. They are generally reluctant to let go of their substrates and will only do so if agitated. Different populations in different substrates are known to exhibit different exoskeletal coloration, suggesting that they can change color to blend in with their environments. The exact mechanisms for this color change, however, remains unknown. Substrates they are most commonly found on in their native habitats include beds and floating clumps of macroalgae like Sargassum muticum, Sargassum miyabei, Sargassum pallidum, Neorhodomela larix, Polysiphonia morrowii, Cystoseira crassipes, Laminaria japonica, Chondrus spp., and Desmarestia viridis; as well as in marine plants (like eelgrass of the genus Zostera), hydrozoans, and bryozoans. In their introduced ranges, they also tend to seek out organisms that exhibit structures their slender bodies can easily blend with. These include macroalgae like Ulva lactuca, Ceramium spp., Plocamium spp., Cladophora spp., Chorda filum, Fucus vesiculosus, Pylaiella spp. and the introduced Sargassum muticum; hydrozoans like Obelia spp. and Tubularia indivisa; bryozoans; tube-building amphipods like Monocorophium acherusicum and Jassa marmorata; and even soft-bodied tunicates like Ascidiella aspersa and Ciona intestinalis. In both their native and introduced ranges, C. mutica are also synanthropic, being found abundantly in fouling communities in artificial structures like submerged ropes, fishing nets, pilings, docks, buoys, aquaculture equipment, oil rig platforms, ship hulls, and even offshore wind farms. In their introduced ranges (particularly in Europe), they are primarily and even exclusively found inhabiting artificial structures. C. mutica can reach extremely high densities in their introduced range when colonizing artificial structures. A survey of C. mutica populations in Chaleur Bay, Quebec revealed concentrations of 468,800 individuals per ; while a survey in Dunstaffnage Bay, Firth of Lorn, Scotland reported 319,000 individuals per . In contrast, C. mutica in their native habitats reach maximum densities of only around 1,220 to 2,600 individuals per . Populations reach peak numbers during the late summer (August to September) before experiencing a sharp decline in the winter months. =Diet and predators= Caprella mutica are omnivorous highly adaptable opportunistic feeders. Examinations of their stomach contents reveal a highly varied diet that depended on the particular substrate they are found on. They are predominantly detritivores, but have the remarkable ability of adjusting feeding methods from being grazers, scavengers, filter feeders, and even predators depending on the conditions of their environments. C. mutica sieve food particles or small organisms from the water by waving their bodies back and forth, with the comb-like setae on their second pair of antennae extended. They then clean off trapped particles by bending their antennae down to their mouthparts. They also use their antennae to scrape food particles from surfaces of their bodies or the substrate that they are clinging to. The large gnathopods are used for striking at and grasping both mobile and sessile prey. Known prey organisms of C. mutica include algae (both planktonic and macroalgae), dinoflagellates, hydrozoans, bryozoans, diatoms, copepods, brine shrimps, and other amphipods. They are capable of feeding on suspended organic particles, including fish feed and decaying organic matter. C. mutica are also known to engage in cannibalistic behavior on dead and dying individuals of their own species or genus. Like other caprellids, C. mutica are preyed upon predominantly by fish and crabs. In their native habitats, the predators of Caprella mutica include the shore crab Carcinus maenas and the goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) which consume them in large numbers. Other predators include nudibranchs, starfish, nemertean worms, sea anemones, and hydrozoans. They constitute a valuable food source for these organisms due to their high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids. They also provide an important link in the food chain between plankton and larger fish. This, in addition to their relative abundance and fast growth rates, make them a potentially important resource for marine fish feed in aquaculture. Introduced populations of C. mutica have become a major part of the diets of native wild and farmed fish. =Reproduction and life history= Wild populations of Caprella mutica show a higher number of females than males. This may be related to the fact that females are aggressively defended by males from competing males, resulting in high male mortality. The larger sizes and greater visibility of males also make them more vulnerable targets for predators that rely on eyesight like fish. C. mutica are r-strategists. They reproduce all throughout the year, with peak seasons in the summer (March to July). The gnathopods of Caprella mutica males are used in aggressive \\"boxing matches\\" that can often be lethal. Males exhibit sexual competition and courting behavior. They aggressively engage in \\"boxing matches\\" using their large second pair of gnathopods in the presence of receptive females. These encounters often have lethal results, as the gnathopods and their poison teeth can be used to impale or slice an opponent in half. Males will also repeatedly touch the exoskeletons of the females with their antennae to detect signs of moulting (ecdysis). Like all crustaceans, females are only capable of mating shortly after shedding their old hardened exoskeletons. Amplexus lasts for 10 to 15 minutes. Once mated, the males will defend the females for a short period (around 15 minutes). After this period, the females begin to exhibit aggressive behavior and will drive off the males. They will then bend their fourth and fifth pereonites at a 90-degree angle. Once their genital openings (located on the fifth pereonite) are aligned with the opening of the brood pouches, they quickly deposit fertilized eggs into them. Females carrying fertilized eggs remain highly aggressive towards males throughout the brooding period, indicating maternal behavior intended to protect the developing embryo from male aggression. A brood pouch of a female can contain 3 to 363 eggs, averaging at 74 eggs. Larger females tend to produce more eggs. The eggs are incubated inside the brood pouch for 30 to 40 days before hatching. Like all amphipods, caprellids lack a planktonic larval stage and the hatchlings resemble miniature adults. The juveniles may cling to their mothers upon hatching and the females continue to protect their offspring that remain close. Hatchlings measure around and grow to an average of per instar. C. mutica mature rapidly, moulting at an average of once each week until they enter the \\"premature stage\\", becoming sexually differentiated at the fifth instar. The durations between moulting cycles then become longer in their seventh to ninth instars, averaging at once every two weeks until sexual maturity. This can occur in as early as 21 days and not later than 46 days after hatching, depending on environmental conditions. In wild populations, however, this can take as much as six months when the juveniles are hatched in the late summer. Males begin to increase in size at a faster rate with each successive moult after the seventh instar. Females, on the other hand, produce their first brood at the seventh instar. They may moult several times as adults, becoming sexually receptive each time until death. The average lifespan of C. mutica in laboratory conditions is 68.8 days for males and 82 days for females. Distribution and invasive ecology Global distribution of Caprella mutica: Location and date of first records in each area are also shown, along with likely introduction pathways indicated by arrows. Caprella mutica are native to the subarctic regions of the Sea of Japan in northwestern Asia. They were first discovered in the Peter the Great Gulf in the federal subject of Russia, Primorsky Krai. They were redescribed by the Japanese marine biologist Ishitaro Arimoto in 1976 who noted that they were also present in the island of Hokkaido and surrounding regions. In a span of only 40 years, they have spread into other parts of the world through multiple accidental introductions (both primary and \\"stepping stone\\" secondary introductions) from the hulls or ballast water of international maritime traffic, aquaculture equipment, and shipments of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). Genetic studies of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the populations of C. mutica reveal high genetic diversity in the Sea of Japan region, unequivocally identifying it as their native range. In contrast, non-native populations in North America, Europe, and New Zealand had poor variation. The detection of genetic material present in non-native populations, however, also make it probable that there are unknown regions that C. mutica may also be native to; though it might also be simply that the sample groups used in the studies were too small. Comparisons of mtDNA of the different populations make it possible to trace the possible routes of introduction. The most likely of which is that the original non- native introduction was to the west coast of North America, which exhibit the highest genetic diversity in non-native populations. Multiple later introductions happened in Europe and eastern North America. From here, additional populations were transported to nearby ports. Europe and eastern North America are also the possible sources for the New Zealand C. mutica population. =North America= The first specimens of C. mutica outside of its native range was recovered from Humboldt Bay, California by Donald M. Martin in 1973. Martin misidentified them as a subspecies of C. acanthogaster. He named them Caprella acanthogaster humboldtiensis. Additional specimens (also treated as C. acanthogaster or C. acanthogaster humboldtiensis) were recovered between 1976 and 1978 from the Oakland Estuary, Elkhorn Slough, and San Francisco Bay. It wasn't until 1981, when the specimens were correctly identified as C. mutica by Dan C. Marelli. Along with additional specimens discovered in 1983 in Coos Bay, Oregon, these populations are believed to have been introduced to the area as a result of the importation of oyster spat of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) from Japan for oyster farming. Oysters are usually transported with algae as a packing material, particularly Sargassum muticum in which C. mutica are associated with. Populations of C. mutica discovered in Puget Sound, Washington in the 1970s as well as additional populations noted in the states of Oregon and California of the United States in the 2000s are believed to have been the result of shipping activities and intracoastal secondary spreading of the original populations. C. mutica were also discovered in Ketchikan, Sitka, Juneau, Cordova, Kodiak, Kachemak Bay, Prince William Sound, and Unalaska in Alaska between 2000 and 2003. This was the first instance of a non-native marine species being found in the Aleutian Islands. In 2009, they were discovered to have spread into British Columbia, Canada. This indicates that C. mutica have completely expanded up the entire west coast of North America. In 2003, surveys by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Sea Grant along the Atlantic coast of the United States revealed multiple established populations in seaports along the coastlines of Connecticut to Maine. In the same year, C. mutica were also reported in Passamaquoddy Bay and Chaleur Bay of New Brunswick and Quebec, Canada. =Europe= C. mutica populations in Europe were first found in the Netherlands in 1995. During a species inventory, several specimens of an unknown caprellid were recovered by Platvoet et al. from artificial structures in and around the Neeltje-Jans and the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier in Burghsluis, Zeeland. As with the case of the first discovery of C. mutica in North America, Platvoet et al. initially misidentified them as a new species. Remarking upon the resemblance of the caprellids to C. acanthogaster, they named it Caprella macho. They were later discovered to be introduced populations of C. mutica rather than a new species. Since then, additional populations have been detected in Belgium (1998), Norway (1999), Germany (2000), Scotland (2000), England (2003), Wales (2003), Ireland (2003), France (2004), and Denmark (2005). They exist in extremely dense populations and are all associated with areas of high human activity. They are believed to have been introduced through shipping and aquaculture equipment from the United States and Asia. As of 2011, there have been no recorded sightings of C. mutica around the Iberian Peninsula, the Baltic Sea, or the Mediterranean Sea. =New Zealand= Caprella mutica were first detected in New Zealand in the port of Timaru, South Island in 2002. This was the first incident of C. mutica being reported in the southern hemisphere. Since then, more well-established populations of C. mutica have been found in Port Lyttelton in 2006, and in the Marlborough Sounds and Wellington Harbour in 2007. Additional specimens were also recovered from the hulls of vessels in other ports, though they did not seem to have established colonies in the ports themselves. Genetic studies of the New Zealand populations suggests a possibility that these were secondarily introduced from non-native populations of C. mutica in the Atlantic through ballast water in the sea chests of international shipping. =Impact= The direct environmental and economic impacts of introduced C. mutica populations remain unknown. They provide valuable food sources for larger predators, particularly fish. In New Zealand, for example, they have become part of the diet of the native big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis). In Europe, wild and farmed fish like the common dab (Limanda limanda), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), and the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), consume large amounts of non-native C. mutica. However, their larger sizes and very aggressive behavior also make them a serious threat to native species of skeleton shrimp. A study in 2009 on the native populations of Caprella linearis, a smaller caprellid species in the Helgoland region of the German Bight in the North Sea, have revealed that C. linearis have more or less vanished and have been replaced by C. mutica. C. mutica fouling populations may also incur minor economic effects through the cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls. =Control= There are no known effective control measures for invasive Caprella mutica populations as of 2012. It has been suggested that the seasonal population fluctuations may be taken advantage of. Eradication efforts done during the winter months when C. mutica populations are dormant and at their lowest numbers, are potentially more effective in preventing their recovery during the summer months. Because of the great difficulty in detecting and removing them, however, control methods will likely focus on preserving native species populations rather than the eradication of established C. mutica.

Mazuruk briefly served in the Soviet Air Force during the late 1920s and then became a Civil Air Fleet pilot. After becoming a polar aviator, he commanded a modified Tupolev TB-3 during the North Pole-1 drifting ice station mission, the first such mission. For his actions Mazuruk was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. He became head of the Glavsevmorput Polar Aviation Directorate. After rejoining the Soviet Air Force, Mazuruk flew combat missions in the Winter War and World War II. Between 1942 and 1944, he successively led the Krasnoyarsk Air Route and the 1st Ferry Aviation Division, both responsible for ferrying Allied Lend-Lease aircraft from Alaska to Siberia. Mazuruk reached the rank of Major General after the end of the war and continued to participate in polar expeditions, retiring from the Air Force in 1953. He worked at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute after his retirement and died in 1989. Early life Mazuruk was born in Brest-Litovsk on 20 July 1906. In 1915, he moved to Lgov. Mazuruk graduated from primary school and until 1919 studied at a higher primary school. Between 1919 and 1920 he worked as a laborer at the Lgov railway station. In the summer of 1920 he and his family moved to Rivne, which soon became part of Poland. Mazuruk worked as a laborer at the railway station and as a night watchman at the hospital. In April 1923, he illegally crossed the border and immigrated to the Soviet Union. Between 1923 and 1924, Mazuruk worked as an assistant engineer at a power plant in Lipetsk. From 1924 to 1926, he was secretary of the Komsomol Volost Committee in the village of Kuzminskiye Otverzhki and the Lipetsky Uyezd Komsomol Committee, and head of the school department of the Oryol Governorate Komsomol Committee. Between 1926 and 1927, Mazuruk was deputy head of the agitation and propaganda department of the Oryol City Party Committee.  Air Force and Civil Air Fleet work  In October 1927, Mazuruk was sent into the Soviet Air Force on a Komsomol travel ticket. In 1928, he graduated from the Leningrad Air Force Military-Theoretical School. In 1929, Mazuruk graduated from the Borisoglebsk Air Force Pilot School. In November 1929, he was demobilized. Between 1930 and 1932 he worked as a GVF (Civil Air Fleet) pilot in Central Asia. From April to June 1930, Mazuruk participated in the fighting against the Basmachi movement. In 1932, he became a pilot and detachment commander in the Far Eastern Directorate of the GVF. He was one of the first pilots to master a number of new air routes. In 1936, Mazuruk graduated from courses at the Bataysk GVF Flight School. Polar exploration From October 1936, Mazuruk was a polar aviation pilot. In 1937, Mazuruk commanded a modified Tupolev TB-3 aircraft that airlifted personnel and material to North Pole-1, the first North Pole manned drifting station. His plane arrived at NP-1 on 26 May after an emergency landing, the last to arrive at the station. He was decorated as a Hero of the Soviet Union and awarded the Order of Lenin for his participation in this historic mission on 27 June. In May 1938, he became head of the Polar Aviation Directorate of Glavsevmorput. Great Patriotic War In January 1939, Mazuruk rejoined the Soviet Air Force, receiving the rank of Colonel on 29 January. In the same year, he graduated from refresher courses at the Zhukovsky Air Force Academy. Mazuruk fought in the Winter War between December 1939 and March 1940. He commanded a separate night bomber aviation squadron of the 8th Army Air Force. Mazuruk flew on several TB-3 missions. Mazuruk fought in the Great Patriotic War from June to October 1941, commanding the 2nd Aviation Group of the Northern Fleet Air Force. He flew on several sorties, including a Soviet raid on German naval bases in the Varangerfjord. Between December 1941 and August 1942, Mazuruk served as deputy head of Glavsevmorput and at the same time was the head of polar aviation. After the July 1942 destruction of Convoy PQ 17, he took part in the search for survivors and helped evacuate sailors from Novaya Zemlya. In August 1942, he became head of the Krasnoyarsk Air Route, responsible for ferrying United States Lend-Lease aircraft. From June 1943 to June 1944, Mazuruk commanded the 1st Ferry Aviation Division, also responsible for ferrying aircraft. During the war over 8,000 aircraft were delivered to the USSR via this route. In late May 1944, Mazuruk met American Vice President Henry A. Wallace on the latter's Siberian visit. In June 1944, he became deputy head of Glavsevmorput and head of polar aviation again, a position he held until March 1947. Post-war Mazuruk was promoted Major General on 5 July 1946. Between 1947 and 1949, he was deputy head of the Research Institute of the Civil Air Fleet. In November 1949, he became head of flight inspection and deputy chief of polar aviation. Mazuruk participated in the 1950 Sever-5 drift station expedition and in the 1951 evacuation of North Pole-2 drift station. He retired from active duty in February 1953 and worked for the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute. Mazuruk participated in the 1954 Sever-6, 1955 Sever-7, 1959 Sever-11, 1960 Sever-12, and 1961 Sever-13 drift station expeditions. He made over 254 flights to polar research stations, including the first landing of an Antonov An-2 aircraft in Antarctica in January 1956 during the 1st Soviet Antarctic Expedition in 1956.

It was the first commercial medical cannabis testing lab to open in the United States. Founding Steep Hill was founded by David Lampach, Addison DeMoura, and Steve DeAngelo in 2007. In accordance with California Proposition 215 (1996) and California‚Äôs Prop. 64 Adult Use of Marijuana Act regulations, Steep Hill routinely analyzes samples from the California medical and adult-use cannabis markets for signs of active compounds, microbiological contamination, residual solvents and pesticides. The lab uses Shimadzu equipment for gas chromatography. Steep Hill has advocated for strict safety and quality testing regulations in the cannabis industry.  Products  The lab is known for of its QuantaCann and QuantaCann2 systems, the first instant onsite potency analysis systems in the medical cannabis industry. QuantaCann is on-site potency and moisture machinery providing important analytical information from cannabis samples in 60 seconds. The QuantaCann machinery was featured in the 2014 episode of CSI: Vegas, \\"Buzz Kill\\" as the scientific equipment used to solve a murder in a dispensary. In addition, Steep Hill Labs created GenKits, a genetics kit used for identifying various cannabis strains. It has been primarily used for young seedlings so that growers may identify young male plants. With this information growers are able to use additional genetic testing for traits to determine whether or not to remove them from their yields. Cannabis cultivators use GenKit for the classification, documentation, and safeguarding of cannabis varietals. The lab complements this with programs that seek to identify specific THCA and CBDA content in plants. Other Steep Hill products include their Phenosight‚Ñ¢ products, which guide marker-assisted breeding programs in developing cannabis strains with desirable traits, and Strain Fingerprint, quantifying the average concentrations of the twelve most common cannabinoids and terpenoids found in cannabis strains.

Commissioned in 1806, she saw active service in the Napoleonic Wars, mostly in the Mediterranean, and afterwards served off the West Coast of Africa, acting to suppress the slave trade. She was lost at sea in 1827. The Mediterranean in wartime Redwing was built by Matthew Warren at Brightlingsea, Essex, and launched on 30 August 1806. She was commissioned in October 1806 under Commander Thomas Ussher, and on 31 January 1807, sailed for the Mediterranean. There she was stationed in the Strait of Gibraltar, and operated in company with and to clear the area of enemy vessels. The Commander in Chief, Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood, in a letter to William Marsden, dated 24 May 1807, praised their effectiveness, noting that \\"within this Fortnight past they have taken and destroyed Eighteen of the Enemy's Vessels\\". One of these may have been the mistico Tiger, which Redwing intercepted as she was sailing from Cadiz to Algeciras. Redwing sent her into Gibraltar. Numerous captures and actions followed. * On 13 June 1807 Redwing and Scout chased a felucca and the Spanish privateer De Bon Vassallio, which mounted one 24 and two 6-pounder guns, into the mouth of the River Barbate, south of Cadiz. They then sent their boats to board and destroy the privateer. They also captured and destroyed two signal posts. * On 22 September, Redwing and two boats from captured the merchant ship Paulina, and on 3 October 1807 Redwing took the Twillingen. * On 2 March 1808 Redwing and captured the American ship Ocean, and on 12 April 1808 Redwing and captured the American ship Hope. * In early 1808, or so, Redwing captured the Charlotta, Ferrier, master, which had sailed from La Guayra, and sent her into Gibraltar. * On 7 May, she attacked a Spanish convoy of seven gun-boats and armed vessels, and 12 unarmed merchantmen off Cape Trafalgar. In a short but vigorous action she drove four gun-boats ashore and sank them, captured one, and two escaped.The gunboats sunk included the Diligent, of two 24-pounder guns, two 8-pounders, and 60 men, the Boreas of the same strength, No. 3, of two 24-pounders, one 36-pounder and 36 men, and No. 6, of one 24-pounder and 40 men. Redwing also captured a mistico of four 6-pounders and 20 men. Gunboat No. 107, of two 6-poundrs and 35 men, and a felucca of four 3-pounders and 20 men, escaped. Redwing then sank four of the merchantmen and captured seven; one escaped.James, Vol.V, pp.47‚Äì48 Redwing lost one man killed and had three men wounded, one severely. For this action in 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM) with clasp \\"Redwing 7 May 1808\\" to the seven still surviving claimants from the action. At the end of the month, Redwing engaged in another medal-winning action. She chased a mistico and two feluccas into the Bay of Bolonia (Tarifa). There her quarry took shelter under a shore battery of six 24-pounder guns. Ussher brought Redwing to anchor within point-blank range of the battery, using her broadsides to silence its guns. A cutting-out party under Lieutenant Ferguson then destroyed the mistico and extracted the feluccas. Ussher and Ferguson, with a landing party of 40 men, then captured the battery and spiked its guns. This, and his previous actions, led to Ussher's promotion to post captain. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasp \\"Redwing 31 May 1808\\" to the five surviving claimants from the action. Commander Edward Augustus Down then took command of Redwing in August and sailed her to the Mediterranean on 23 September 1808. * On 8 February 1809, the boats of Redwing and the frigate , under the command of William Hoste, cut out an armed brig and a coaster at Melada in Dalmatia, then part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy.James, Vol.V, p.153 * On 16 September 1811 Redwing, captured the French 4-gun privateer, Le Victorieux, off Sicily, three days out of Tunis. * On 8 May 1812, off Cape St. Vieto, Redwing took a small Neapolitan privateer of one gun. Command of Redwing passed to Commander Sir John Gordon Sinclair in August 1812 and she operated off the south coast of France, taking part in numerous operations: * On 18 March 1813, seamen and marines of Redwing, under the command of Lieutenant Aaron Tozer, landed on the French coast and destroyed a coastal battery consisting of four 24-pounder guns, a 6-pounder field-gun, and a 13-inch mortar at Carry-le-Rouet, west of Marseille, before capturing a tartane, anchored nearby. * On 31 March 1813, an attack was made, under the command of Lieutenant Shaw of Volontaire, by the marines of the frigates Volontaire and , and the brigs Redwing and on a strongpoint at Morgion, near Marseille. The marines landed during the night, and at daybreak captured two batteries. They threw the guns, five 36-pounders in one, and two 24-pounders in the other, into the sea, and destroyed all their ammunition. The boats of the ships then captured eight tartanes and three settees, laden with oil, nuts, hides and firewood, while Redwing provided close protection. Casualties amounted to only one man killed and four wounded, while the French lost four killed, five wounded, and a lieutenant and 16 men of the 62nd Regiment taken prisoner. * On 3 April, and Redwing captured the Greek vessel St. Nicolo, and took her into Malta. * On 2 May boats from Redwing, Undaunted, Volontaire, and again stormed the batteries at Morgion. This action led the Admiralty to issue Redwing a third clasp, marked \\"2 May Boat Service 1813\\", to the NGSM for her part in this action. * On 24 May Redwing, Nautilus and captured the privateer Columbo. * On 18 August, a landing party made up of men from Redwing, , and the frigate Undaunted, stormed shore batteries at Cassis, east of Marseille, and captured three pinnaces. * On 14 December 1813, Redwing captured the Boa Fe Nova. This may be the same vessel as the Boa F√© Saltaza, which had been sailing from Rio de Janeiro to Oporto and which Redwing captured and sent into Portsmouth some days later. Post-war In August 1814, Commander Thomas Young was appointed to command Redwing. She was paid off in 1815. By 1817 she was laid up at Deptford, but was recommissioned in 1818 under C. Simeon. By August of that year she was under the command of Commander Frederick Hunn at Saint Helena, and commissioned in November 1820 under the command of the Honourable George Rolle Walpole Trefusis. From February 1824 she was under the command of Adolphus FitzClarence at the Nore until paid off in January 1825. =West Africa= In January 1825 Commander Douglas Clavering, who in 1823 led a scientific expedition to Svalbard and Greenland, was appointed captain of Redwing, and assigned to the West Africa Squadron, engaged in the suppression of the slave trade. She made several captures: * On 9 September 1825 the ships , , and Redwing captured the Brazilian slave-vessel Uniao. * On 6 October 1825 Redwing captured the Spanish brigantine Isabella with 273 slaves aboard. * That same day Redwing captured the Spanish schooner Ana, and five days later the Teresa. with 199 slaves. Prize money for the hulls and cargoes, and bounty for released slaves, was paid on 25 April 1827. Disappearance and fate Redwing sailed from Sierra Leone in June 1827 and was never seen again. Wreckage washed ashore in November near Mataceney suggested that lightning had started a fire that destroyed her.

The power package can be mated with any hang glider wing. Ready to fly the aircraft features a cable-braced hang glider-style high-wing, weight-shift controls, single-place accommodation, foot-launching and landing and a single engine in pusher configuration. The aircraft uses a standard hang glider wing, made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. The wing is supported by a single tube-type kingpost and uses an \\"A\\" frame control bar. The engine is a lightweight, two-stroke, single cylinder Radne Raket 120 of that produces power though a 3.5:1 belt reduction drive, with an extension shaft. Folding legs protect the propeller during ground operations. The engine package can be installed in most hang glider pod harnesses. The Mosquito can also be purchased as a complete harness assembly. The original Mosquito design was updated in 2001 as the Mosquito NRG, which remains in production.

He was a Visiting Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City in 1997-98 and a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford in 2000-01. Scholarly Work Dr. Rumbaut is best known for his research on immigration and refugee movements, generations, and transitions to adulthood. For more than three decades, he has directed seminal comparative empirical studies of the adaptation of immigrants and refugees in the United States. He directed (with Alejandro Portes) the landmark Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS),Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS), 1991-2006 begun in 1991; and, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team, the Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles (IIMMLA) study.Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles (IIMMLA), 2004 He also directed the first National Survey of Immigration Scholars (NASIS) in the United States. In the 1980s, he directed the principal studies of the migration and incorporation of refugees from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia‚Äîthe Indochinese Health and Adaptation Research Project (IHARP) and the Southeast Asian Refugee Youth Study.Rub√©n G. Rumbaut Dataverse - Harvard Dataverse Network He has traveled to Vietnam and Cambodia, and earlier to Sierra Leone, where he organized a field project on international health and economic development. In the 1990s, he was academic advisor for a 10-part PBS television series, Americas, focusing on Latin American and Caribbean societies, as well as on Mexicans, Cubans and Puerto Ricans in the U.S.Formats and Editions of The Americans [WorldCat.org] In the 2000s, as a member of a panel of the National Academy of Sciences, he worked on two volumes on the Hispanic population of the United States: \\"Multiple Origins, Uncertain Destinies,\\" and \\"Hispanics and the Future of America.\\"Multiple Origins, Uncertain Destinies - SET  The National Academies Press In substance, Professor Rumbaut is known as one of the original architects of the segmented- assimilation paradigm of immigrant incorporation. Developed in the 1990s, the paradigm argues that the experiences of recent immigrant groups are more diverse than either the classic assimilation or ethnic disadvantage perspectives suggests. It posits three alternative pathways for the children of immigrants. The first is the conventional upward trajectory toward assimilation. The second is a process called selective acculturation, in which some groups try to inspire achievement in their children by referencing the traditional values of the home country, such as a dedication to education. The third and most controversial pathway is known as downward mobility, in which members of the most disadvantaged groups face substantial structural barriers to advancement, such as poor urban schools and employment discrimination. Children in these disadvantaged contexts may become racialized or turn to attitudes and behaviors considered oppositional to the mainstream, such as rejecting school or joining a street gang. The extent to which downward mobility is occurring remains contested and has inspired many studies. Because educational attainment is a primary marker of immigrant mobility, much of this research focuses on the education of immigrants‚Äô children. He has published over 150 articles and book chapters, and a dozen books, two of which have been translated into other languages. Among his books are the critically acclaimed Immigrant America: A Portrait (with Alejandro Portes; 3rd ed. 2006);Immigrant America, Revised, Expanded, and Updated - Alejandro Portes, Ruben G.

It seems not to be understood by any one, though it is a peculiar confederate phrase, and is as popular as Dixie from the Potomac to the Rio Grande.\\" It resulted in several Civil War songs, including \\"Here's Your Mule\\", \\"How Are You? John Morgan\\", and \\"Turchin's Got Your Mule\\". It is also credited with contributing to General Bragg's failure to rally his troops at Missionary Ridge.Pollard, The Lost Cause, p. 457: \\"The day was shamefully lost. Gen. Bragg attempted to rally the broken troops; he advanced into the fire, and exclaimed, 'Here is your commander,' and was answered with the derisive shouts of an absurd catch-phrase in the army, 'Here's your mule'.\\" Origins Several differing accounts of the origin of the phrase are given. The most common involves soldiers in a camp taking a clever peddler's unattended mule and hiding it. When the peddler discovers the mule missing, he goes around the camp inquiring about it. After a while, a soldier would holler, \\"Mister, here's your mule.\\" When the peddler went toward the call, a soldier in another part of the camp would yell the same, \\"Mister, here's your mule.\\" That continued and took the peddler all over the camp. Variation of the story supposedly took place at the Camp of Instruction in Jackson, Tennessee,Ridley, Battles and Sketches of the Army of Tennessee, pp. 632-635. Beauregard's camp at Centreville, Virginia,Walsh, Handy-book of Literary Curiosities, p. 753. and others. Songs =\\"Here's Your Mule\\"= \\"Here's Your Mule\\" was written by C.D Benson and published in 1862, both by himself in Nashville, Tennessee, and by John Church, Jr. in Cincinnati. The song tells one of the traditional stories about soldiers hiding a farmer's mule and yelling \\"Mister, here's your mule\\" while taking the animal from place to place endlessly. The chorus is: :Come on, come on, Come on, old man, ::And don't be made a fool, :By ev'ry one, You meet in camp, ::With \\"Mister, Here's your mule.\\"Benson, \\"Here's Your Mule (Comic Song)\\". Following John Morgan's 1863 raid, sheet music destined for the Southern market had a chorus pasted in immediately after the final verse: :Come on, come on, come on, old man, ::And don't be made a fool; :I'll tell you the truth as best I can: ::\\"John Morgan's got your Mule!\\"Benson, \\"Here's Your Mule (Comic Camp Song)\\". =\\"Turchin's Got Your Mule\\"= The Union parodied the song in 1863 with \\"Turchin's Got Your Mule\\", an account of John B. Turchin's 1862 foray into Alabama where his soldiers seized Southern goods and property. The song, perhaps written by a cavalryman with the First Ohio,Curry, Four Years in the Saddle, p. 326: \\"While stationed at Fayetteville the First Ohio published a newspaper call the Cavalier, which was edited by William Davis, of Company M. and A. Thompson, of Company D, with T. C. Stevenson and Joe Devreax, of Company D, publishers. The motto at the heading read: 'We Go Where Rebs Await Us.' As will be remembered, it was a spicy sheet, and some poetic cavalryman wrote a parody on Morgan's mule, which ran thus: ... 'Turchin's Got Your Mule'...\\" tells of a plantation owner trying to retrieve his slaves and livestock. The first verse and chorus are: :A planter came to camp one day, ::His niggers for to find; :His mules had also gone astray, ::And stock of every kind. :The planter tried to get them back, ::And then was made a fool, :For every one he met in camp ::Cried, \\"Mister, here's your mule.\\" :Chorus :Go back, go back, go back, old scamp, ::And don't be made a fool; :Your niggers they are all in camp, ::And Turchin's got your mule.Burnett, Incidents of the War, p. 278. =\\"How Are You? John Morgan\\"= C. D. Benson came out with \\"\\"How Are You? John Morgan\\" in 1864 after John Hunt Morgan escaped from the Ohio Penitentiary in 1863. The chorus is: :Then raise the shout, the glorious shout, ::John Morgan's caught at last, :Proclaim it loud, the land throughout, ::He's in to prison fast.Benson, \\"How Are You? John Morgan\\". Chorus to last verse: :Upon his Mule, He's gone they say ::To Dixie's Promised Land, :And at no very distant day ::To lead a new command. =\\"Here's Your Mule\\" (\\"My Maryland\\"/\\"O Tannenbaum\\")= A common Confederate version of unknown authorship was sung to the tune of \\"My Maryland\\". One stanza of this version is: :Hark! Morgan's boys are on a raid, ::Here's your Mule, O here's your mule! :To meet the foe they're not afraid, ::Here's your Mule, O here's your mule! :And when bluecoats, see them come, :They stop and fire and break and run, :And then begins John Morgan's fun, ::Here's your Mule, O here's your mule!Ridley, Battles and Sketchs of the Army of Tennessee, p.634. Another variant of \\"Here's Your Mule\\" using the tune to \\"My Maryland\\" (\\"O Tannenbaum\\"), also of unknown authorship, was published in Nashville's Daily Union, July 14, 1863. The opening verses is: :Come Soldiers, listen to my lay :Here's your mule, your long eared mule :I'll sing the warriors of the day, :Here's your mule, &c.; :Old General Bragg, he leads the way, :And moves his army twice a day, :And once at night, I've heard them say :Here's your mule, your long eared mule.\\"Here's Your Mule\\", Daily Union.

Named for the Island of Tutuila, the largest and main island of American Samoa, it was the second US Naval vessel to bear the name. After serving for nearly 30 years Tutuila was sold to the Republic of China in 1972. Construction Tutuila was laid down 11 August 1943, as the liberty ship SS Arthur P. Gorman, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MCE hull 1179, by the Bethlehem- Fairfield Shipyard, Inc., in Baltimore, Maryland; launched 12 September 1943; transferred to the Navy when 80 percent complete for conversion to an internal combustion engine repair ship on 18 September; converted by the Maryland Drydock Co.; and commissioned there on 8 April 1944, Commander George T. Boldizsar in command. Service history =World War II= Tutuila underwent shakedown in Hampton Roads from 20 April to 24 May, before sailing for the Panama Canal and proceeding via San Diego, Pearl Harbor, and Eniwetok to the South Pacific Theater. Early in August, the repair ship joined Service Squadron (ServRon) 10, based at Purvis Bay, in the once hotly contested Solomon Islands. Tutuila served the Fleet as a floating advance base as it swept its way across the Pacific toward Japan. For the final year of the war, the repair ship engaged in round-the-clock work schedules which seldom slackened. Tutuila aided in the buildup for the operations which led to the liberation of the Philippines from the Japanese occupation. Upon completion of this campaign, American task forces set their sights on islands closer to the Japanese homeland. Iwo Jima and Okinawa fell to the telling power of American shells, bombs, and troops which stormed ashore supported by a great Allied armada. Soon, the Allied navies were within shelling distance of the Japanese home islands themselves. During this time, the repair ship operated first out of Manus, in the Admiralty Islands, before moving to Ulithi in the Caroline Islands. In the wake of the liberation of the Philippines, Tutuila arrived at Leyte on 24 May 1945, and provided repair services there to a wide variety of ships and smaller craft from the date of her arrival until the end of hostilities. =Postwar period= After the war, Tutuilas work was far from over. As American and Allied forces prepared for occupation of the Japanese homeland, the ship joined those forces headed north for duty off Japan's shores. On 30 August, Tutuila‚Äîin company with , , and 11 smaller ships‚Äîset out on the first leg of the voyage northward. One day out, a typhoon Helen lashed at the convoy, forcing the slower repair ship to remain with the \\"small boys\\" while Jason and Whitney received orders to run for Japan. On 2 September, having weathered the storm and shepherded her charges to safe harbor, Tutuila dropped anchor in Buckner Bay, Okinawa. From there, Tutuila proceeded with a 33-ship convoy, bound for Korea, making port at Jinsen, (Incheon) on 24 September 1945. She operated there as a maintenance vessel for ships engaged in the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war. She continued this work after moving to Taku, China, where she arrived on 26 January 1946. Departing Taku on 30 March, the ship steamed to Shanghai, China, where she dropped anchor on 2 April. Six days later, she sailed for the United States. The ship transited the Panama Canal and arrived at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 20 May. Following repairs, she moved to Galveston, Texas, on 9 June 1946, for deactivation and was decommissioned there six months later, on 7 December 1946. =1950‚Äì1962= Tutuila was laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet in Texas, until the summer of 1950, when North Korean troops crossed the 38th parallel and invaded South Korea. As the United States armed forces mobilized to support the United Nations effort, Tutuila received the call to return to active service. Towed to Orange, Texas, she was reconditioned with new shop machinery which replaced her /38 caliber gun and Bofors guns and their magazines. On 7 May 1951, the ship was recommissioned and assigned to the Service Force, Atlantic Fleet. Tutuila arrived at Norfolk, on 30 May 1951, and served there until 13 October, when she proceeded to Baltimore, for one week before returning to Hampton Roads, where she remained from 23 October 1951 to 16 June 1952. Tutuila with minesweepers, 1959. Calling briefly at Guant√°namo Bay, from 20 to 23 June, she operated out of Norfolk again from 28 June to 15 August, and from 22 August to 30 October, with a stint at New York City, in between. She continued this routine of east coast operations from 1952 through 1957, with occasional calls at Port-au-Prince, Haiti; Havana, Cuba; and Guant√°namo Bay. In 1957, the ship paid good will calls to Bermuda, in June, and Nova Scotia, in August, with groups of Explorer Scouts embarked for each cruise. In October 1958, Tutuila again visited Havana, and then proceeded to Philadelphia, where she took part in a special project for reclaiming materiel from ships in reserve before returning to Norfolk. She underwent a major overhaul at the Norfolk Navy Yard from 31 October 1958 to 21 January 1959, before proceeding to Guantanamo Bay, late in March. But for a round-trip cruise to Port-au-Prince, from 10 to 12 April, the ship served there until summer when she returned to the Virginia capes for antisubmarine exercises. The ship continued her operations out of Norfolk until the autumn of 1962. On one occasion, the repair ship encountered merchantman SS William Johnson in distress while en route to Norfolk and, within a short time, Tutuila sent over a repair crew to correct the engineering casualty. Cuban Missile Crisis and Dominican Intervention American reconnaissance planes flying over Cuba in the fall of 1962, noticed unusual activities there; and, when photographic prints were developed, the unusual items and activities were found to be Russian-built missiles and missile sites. In reaction to this threat, President John F. Kennedy ordered the Navy to throw a cordon around Cuba‚Äîinstituting a \\"quarantine\\" of the island. In this tense climate, Navy destroyers and patrol planes formed a picket line, turning back Russian ships carrying missiles. Tutuila proceeded to Morehead City, North Carolina, where she rendered services to Amphibious Squadron 6 before stopping at Norfolk to load cargo and proceed south to support the quarantine line. Basing out of Roosevelt Roads Naval Station and Vieques, Puerto Rico, the ship provided supplies and services for the ships engaged in blockading Cuban sea lanes. After the Soviet Government complied with President Kennedy's demand for the withdrawal of the missiles and all of their associated technicians, sites, and the like, tensions eased. Tutuila proceeded north toward Norfolk but encountered a storm‚Äîmuch like the one weathered in 1945, with 80-knot winds and heavy seas ‚Äîwhich caused a three-day delay in her returning to home port. =1963‚Äì1966= Operating out of Norfolk and Charleston, South Carolina, through 1964, the ship provided repair services during Operation \\"Springboard\\" in January 1965. Visits to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico; Frederik-sted and St. Croix, in the American Virgin Islands; and Fort Lauderdale, Florida; provided the crew with sightseeing and recreational activities in between her regular duties out of the east coast ports of Norfolk and Charleston. In March 1965, Tutuila participated in a program to reclaim materiel and special equipment installed on radar picket destroyers which were currently being decommissioned at Bayonne, NJ. As flagship of ServRon 4, Tutuila returned to Norfolk before heading south to the strife-torn Dominican Republic. While performing repair and support duties during the months of April and May, the ship conducted a special series of operations geared toward supplying needed petroleum products to light and power facilities in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, after rebel gunfire had prevented normal tanker deliveries. For the remainder of the year 1965, she continued operations out of Norfolk following the Dominican intervention, calling at San Juan and Guantanamo Bay for refresher training after her annual Portsmouth overhaul. During March and April 1966, Tutuila underwent extensive preparation for overseas deployment, as repair shops, berthing and messing spaces were air-conditioned, and new communications equipment was procured and installed. =Vietnam War= The repair ship sailed from Norfolk on 9 May, and transited the Panama Canal on 18 May. After brief stops at Pearl Harbor and at Subic Bay in the Philippines, the repair ship arrived at An Thoi, Phu Quoc Island, in the Gulf of Siam, to support Operation \\"Market Time\\" off the coast of South Vietnam. Relieving on 19 July, Tutuila commenced servicing the nimble and hard-hitting PCFs, or \\"Swift\\" boats, attached to Division 11. WPBs of the Coast Guard's Division 11 were based on Tutuila as well. The following month found Tutuilas LCMs and their crews participating in Operation \\"Sea-mount\\", an Army-directed landing operation to clear the southern Phu Quoc Island of enemy forces. Landing South Vietnamese troops at four locations, Tutuilas boats also carried supplies and ammunition to the Allied ground forces while helicopters evacuated casualties to the repair ship for medical attention. Krishna returned to An Thoi on 8 October, to relieve Tutuila, which then steamed to Bangkok, Thailand, for rest and relaxation for her crew. The repair ship then arrived back off the Vietnamese coast, reaching Vung Tau, off Cape St. Jacques, on 18 October. Here she supported Operations \\"Market Time\\", \\"Game Warden\\", and \\"Stable Door\\" through the end of 1966. The opening days of the new year, 1967, saw the repair ship taking up support duties for the Mobile Riverine Force established at Vung Tau for operations in the Mekong Delta. Here, she assisted in the preparation of Assault Support Patrol Boat's and other small patrol craft until arrived and took over the major repair and maintenance work. Tutuilas repair crews finished another difficult job in just five days‚Äî the overhauling and repairing of the troublesome diesel generators of . Turned over to the operational control of Commander, Naval Support Activity, Saigon, in April 1967, the ship commenced services to LSTs engaged in operations off the mouth of the Mekong River. During this period, the repair ship continued to provide support and maintenance facilities for craft of the Mobile Riverine Assault Force and supported Coastal Division 13 as well. Further, Tutuilas /50 caliber guns spoke in anger for the first time in the Vietnam War, as the ship undertook a shore bombardment in the Rung Sat Special Zone, providing harassment and interdiction fire into an area of suspected Viet Cong activity north of Vung Tau. Returning to An Thoi in October 1967, Tutuila relieved Krishna and provided support for coastal divisions of Navy and Coast Guard before proceeding to Kaohsiung, Taiwan, for five days of upkeep in late November. She returned to Vung Tau on 7 December, to continue supporting coastal interdiction operations. The repair ship remained at Vung Tau, until taking over duties at An Thoi, in April 1968, from Krishna. While remaining on station through the summer, Tutuila also trained South Vietnamese sailors in the operation of PCFs, four of which had been transferred to the Republic of Vietnam in August. Tutuilas hard work earned the Navy Unit Commendation as a result of the labors conducted at both Vung Tau and An Thoi. Extensive improvements in habitability highlighted the yard work conducted at Yokosuka in January 1969, while the main engine, auxiliary pumps, and the three main generators were all subjected to thorough overhauling. On 21 March, the ship departed from Yokosuka for sea trials and refresher training‚Äîa virtually new ship both inside and out. The final week of training completed by 22 April, Tutuila cleared the Japanese isles on 27 April; bound, once more, for Vietnam. After a five-day visit to Hong Kong en route, the ship dropped anchor at Vung Tau on 14 May. She commenced work almost immediately, conducting a temporary availability on before 1 June, and filling 36 work requests from as well as repair work and availability requirements for local YFR craft and the Republic of Korea Girin (LSM 610). On 12 June, Tutuila got underway for An Thoi, where she supported the continuation of \\"Market Time\\", as well as \\"Seafloat\\" and \\"Sealord\\", while maintaining PCFs, YFUs, APL-21, and several LSTs. For the months of June and July, the ship also undertook further training operations‚Äîrepairing 17 Vietnamese Navy PCFs and training 39 Vietnamese sailors in diesel engine overhaul. ) underwent two weeks of restricted availability, adding to the repair ship's already busy and round-the-clock schedule. Fulfilling these and other requests for South Vietnamese, Korean, Thai, and United States Navy units, Tutuila remained busy for the remainder of her active career off Vietnam‚Äîreceiving three Navy Unit Commendations in the process. Late in 1971, she was selected for transfer to the Republic of China Navy. On New Year's Day 1972, Tutuila departed Vung Tau after six years of combat support duties. Many times she had hoisted PCFs or other patrol craft onto pontoons alongside for complete overhauls; her crew had taught their Vietnamese counterparts the intricacies of diesel power plants and generators. Her guns had even conducted one offensive shore bombardment. Vietnam lay behind her as she headed for Hong Kong on 1 January 1972. Six days of bad weather jostled her before she finally made port at the British Crown Colony on 7 January. Decommissioning and sale Her stay at Hong Kong was not all rest and relaxation, however, as much lay ahead to be done in preparation for the transfer to the Nationalist Chinese Navy. Tutuilas crew gave her a \\"face lift\\" which included painting; overhauling engines; and getting her records and accounts in order. She departed Hong Kong on 13 January, and arrived at Subic Bay two days later, where, upon arrival, the work of off-loading supplies and ammunition began. Departing Subic Bay on 29 January 1972, Tutuila made port at Kaohsiung on 2 February, to the accompaniment of a Chinese military band which played tunes from the dockside. For the next three weeks, final checks were undertaken to put the finishing touches on the transfer. Finally, by 21 February 1972, all was in readiness. On that day, Tutuila was decommissioned and struck from the Navy list. Transferred to the Nationalist Chinese Navy, she was renamed ROCS Pien Tai (ARG-516) and served as a supply ship into 1979.

It features a series of found-footage shorts written and directed by Adam Wingard, David Bruckner, Ti West, Glenn McQuaid, Joe Swanberg, and the filmmaking collective Radio Silence. The film debuted at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival in January 2012, and was released on demand on August 31, 2012. The film made its limited theatrical premiere in the United States on October 5, 2012, and in the United Kingdom on January 18, 2013. The film spawned two sequels, V/H/S/2 and V/H/S: Viral, and a spin-off, Siren, as well as a miniseries on Snapchat's Snap Originals platform. A reboot \\"V/H/S94\\" was announced in June 2020 with an unknown release date.  Genesis  In an interview with IndieWire, producer Brad Miska revealed the process in which they developed V/H/S, which included a \\"trust-fall\\" style of filmmaking. All of the relationships came through the long history of Bloody Disgusting. Plot The film is presented as an anthology of short horror films, built into a frame narrative which acts as its own short horror film. Each short film is linked together with the concept of found footage (each segment is from the VHS tapes found in the room). =\\"Tape 56\\"/frame narrative= *Directed by Adam Wingard *Written by Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett The frame narrative focuses on a criminal gang who film their exploits, which include smashing the walls and windows of an abandoned house and sexually assaulting a woman in a parking lot. An anonymous source offers them a large sum of money to break into a house and steal a single VHS videotape. The gang is eager to expand their criminal enterprises, and they accept the task. Entering the house, the criminals find an old man sitting dead in front of several televisions playing white noise. Feeling free to roam the house, they discover hundreds of unmarked VHS tapes and set about collecting them all to ensure that they retrieve the right one. One of the criminals stays behind in the TV room with the dead body to watch the \\"Amateur Night\\" tape left in the VCR. The contents of this tape and the four subsequent ones comprise the bulk of the film, with the action cutting back to the criminals' efforts between each short. As the frame narrative progresses, the gang encounters a strange figure moving around the basement, which appears to be the old man. Glimpses of the TV room demonstrate that unknown to the criminals, the man's body disappears at one point only to reappear in the exact position. Similarly, the criminals return to the TV room to find that the first viewer has disappeared, prompting Zak to continue watching the tapes himself. After the ending of \\"The Sick Thing that happened to Emily when she was Younger\\" segment, Gary returns to the TV room to discover that Zak has disappeared as well, he is the only person left, and that the old man's body is gone. Searching the rooms upstairs, he finds the decapitated remains of Zak and is subsequently attacked by the old man, who is now a zombie. The terrified leader flees downstairs, where he falls and is killed by the zombie. The frame narrative ends with the camera left in the TV room picking up the sound of the VCR starting the \\"10/31/98\\" tape by itself. =\\"Amateur Night\\"= *Directed by David Bruckner *Written by David Bruckner and Nicholas Tecosky Shane, Patrick, and Clint are three friends who have rented a motel room to fulfill Shane's intent of bringing women back for sex; Clint's glasses have been outfitted with a hidden camera that will allow them to turn their planned encounter into an amateur porn video. While the three men are bar-hopping, Clint encounters a mysterious young woman, Lily, who appears unusually shy, and says little other than \\"I like you.\\" In addition to picking up Lily, the men also succeed in convincing another young woman, Lisa, to return to their motel with them. Lisa passes out as Shane attempts to initiate sex and Patrick, laughing, discourages him from continuing. Lily continues awkwardly coming on to Clint, but it‚Äôs dejected Shane who comes on to her instead, oblivious to the scales visible on Lily‚Äôs feet as he undresses her. Lily appears responsive, pushing Shane onto his back and then beginning to undress Clint, seemingly beginning a threesome. Overwhelmed, Clint goes to the bathroom; Patrick disrobes and attempts to take Clint's place, but Lily has made it clear that she dislikes Patrick. Moments later, Patrick bursts into the bathroom claiming Lily bit him. When they approach Shane, Lily sprouts fangs, attacks and kills him. Clint and Patrick hide in the bathroom until Patrick, still nude, arms himself with a shower curtain rod and returns to the room. Clint tries to wake Lisa and Patrick attempts to fight Lily but she subdues him, drinks his blood and rips off his genitals. Clint escapes but ends up falling down a stairwell and breaks his wrist in the process. Lily catches up to Clint, but instead of attacking, she attempts fellatio. Due to his pain and fear, Clint is unresponsive which upsets Lily who crawls over to a corner and cries softly, which gets louder, then turns into a horrific growl. Clint flees, begging bystanders for help, but he is suddenly lifted into the sky by Lily, who has transformed into a winged creature. This reveals that she is a succubus who was on the hunt. The glasses fall off Clint's face and hit the ground before the video cuts out. =\\"Second Honeymoon\\"= *Directed by Ti West *Written by Ti West A married couple, Sam and Stephanie, travel to Arizona for their second honeymoon. They visit a Wild West-themed attraction where Stephanie receives a prediction from a mechanical fortune teller, which claims that she will soon be reunited with a loved one. That evening (off camera), a woman comes to Sam and Stephanie's motel room and awkwardly tries to convince Sam to give her a ride the next day. In the middle of the night, while the couple are asleep, someone breaks into the room, turns on the camcorder and films stroking Stephanie's buttocks with a switchblade. The intruder then steals $100 from Sam's wallet and dips his toothbrush in the toilet. The next day, on their way to visit the Grand Canyon, Sam notices the missing money and accuses Stephanie of taking it, but she assumes he is joking. That night, someone enters the room again and repeatedly stabs Sam in the neck with the switchblade, filming him as he chokes on his own blood and dies. The camera then shows the killer, the woman from earlier, cleaning the blade while she and Stephanie make out passionately, revealing that the woman was Stephanie's lover. The recording cuts to Stephanie asking her lover if she has erased the footage. =\\"Tuesday the 17th\\"= *Directed by Glenn McQuaid *Written by Glenn McQuaid Three friends‚ÄîJoey, Spider, and Samantha‚Äîaccompany their new friend, Wendy, on a camping trip. Joey films the group as Wendy leads them through the woods, occasionally mentioning 'accidents' that took the lives of her friends. When scanning certain areas, images of mutilated bodies appear in the film. Wendy then tells them that a murderer killed her friends during a camping trip here the previous year, but the group laughs it off as a joke. Spider and Samantha leave the group and are killed by a human-like figure with a redhead obscured in tracking errors named \\"The Glitch\\" (as identified in the end credits). At the lake, Wendy tells Joey she lured all three of them to the grounds to use as bait so she can find and kill the mysterious force. Wendy reveals that she had been to this lake before where a killer had slaughtered all her friends and she was the only survivor. She notes that the police did not believe her when she said the killer could be in two places at once. The entity walks up behind Joey and slits his throat. Wendy runs away, luring the figure into two easily escaped booby traps and is cut by it in the second one. She films the entity close up, but it continues to be obscured by the tracking error. Wendy continues to run through the woods, she finds Joey in his death throes. After he dies, the figure approaches Wendy and a final trap impales it. Wendy gloats at it and walks away but when she turns around, it is gone; it reappears in a tree and jumps down, beats her with the camera, then slashes her stomach, subsequently eviscerating her and afterward violently inhabiting her body. =\\"The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger\\"= *Directed by Joe Swanberg *Written by Simon Barrett This segment is shown through computer video chats. Emily talks to her boyfriend James, a trainee doctor, about a strange bump on her arm and how it reminds her of an accident she had when she was younger. After witnessing a small, childlike entity rush into her room and slam the door shut, Emily believes her apartment is haunted. Her landlord claims that no children have ever lived in the apartment, but Emily is unconvinced. During her next video chat with James, an increasingly frantic Emily digs into her arm with a scalpel to find out what the bump is, but James urges her to stop before the wound becomes infected. Emily attempts to contact the being, but it knocks her out. James quickly appears in her apartment and surgically removes an alien fetus from Emily's torso. Aliens are using Emily as an incubator for alien/human hybrids, and James has been working for them and removing the fetuses for some time. The aliens erase Emily's memory, and James mentions that the arm bump is a tracking device. In their next chat, a badly injured Emily believes she sustained her injuries after wandering into traffic in a fugue state. She reveals that the doctor James recommended has diagnosed her as schizoaffective, and tearfully says that James deserves a better, more normal girlfriend. He assures Emily that she is the only person he wants to be with, but once their chat ends he begins a new chat with a different woman who has the same bump on her arm and also believes James is her boyfriend, showing that the aliens are using more than one person as an incubator. =\\"10/31/98\\"= *Directed by Radio Silence *Written by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett, Justin Martinez, and Chad Villella It's Halloween 1998. Chad, Matt, Tyler, and Paul (dressed in Halloween costumes as the Unabomber, a pirate, a teddy bear implanted with a nanny cam, and a Marine, respectively) head out to a Halloween party at a friend's house, only to end up at the wrong place. Sneaking inside, they begin to experience paranormal phenomena and believe that they are at a realistic haunted house attraction and have fun with it. In the attic, they find several men gathered around a young woman whom they've suspended from the rafters, apparently performing an exorcism. The men are chanting \\"cast you down\\", and the boys exuberantly join in. One of the men reacts angrily to their presence and physically assaults the young woman. Some of the men are pulled upwards into the darkness by an unseen force. More violent, overtly threatening paranormal phenomena then begin to occur and the boys initially flee before realizing they should try to rescue the girl. Returning to the attic, the boys work to untie her and get her to safety, as the house itself comes to life with poltergeist phenomena and ghostly arms rising from the walls and the floors to claim the lives of the woman's captors. Exiting through the basement, the boys pile into their car with the girl and drive away. The car abruptly stops and the girl disappears, reappearing in the street before them and walking away amid a flock of birds before they realize that they've stopped on train tracks. The boys attempt to get out of the car as the train approaches, but they are unable to unlock the doors. The screen starts to flicker with static and the train smashes into the car off-camera, killing all inside. During the end credits, clips from Tape 56 are shown. Alternative ending to \\"10/31/98\\" A joke ending was shot in one take by Radio Silence in which the doors are unlocked and the boys get out just before the train smashes into their car. The boys walk away and talk about how much fun they had and what a crazy night it was as the train hits the car and it explodes behind them.

Personally, I'm bored by found-footage horror films, which this is. And omnibus attempts rarely work. But this one does. It's terrifying, and very well executed.\\" Horror-Movies.ca reported that two people fainted during the premiere at Sundance. At the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, Magnolia Pictures purchased the North American rights to the film for slightly over $1 million. Limited theatrical release began October 5, 2012 in the United States and November 1, 2012 in Argentina. The film was released onto DVD, Blu-ray, and digital download on December 4, 2012. It was released on the titular format of VHS on February 5, 2013. Reception The film currently holds a 57% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 101 reviews with an average rating of 5.62/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"An uneven collection of found-footage horror films, V/H/S has some inventive scares but its execution is hit-and-miss.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film holds an average score of 55, based on reviews from 21 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Most reviewers said that they felt the film was too long. Variety noted that \\"the segments vary in quality and the whole overstays its welcome at nearly two hours. Some trimming (perhaps relegating a weaker episode to a DVD extra) would increase theatrical chances.\\" Empire gave the film four stars out of five, saying that \\"the biggest twist is its consistently high quality ... anything goes, and all of it works\\". The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mildly positive review, stating \\"Refreshingly, V/H/S promises no more than it delivers, always a plus with genre fare.\\" Fangoria praised the film while remarking that \\"the mystery of why/how some of this stuff is even on VHS tapes to begin with\\" was a bit of a leap. Sean O'Connell of The Washington Post gave the film a scathing review, saying that although \\"on paper, it's a clever concept\\" and \\"probably sounded great in the pitch meeting\\", it \\"loses all luster through some shoddy execution\\". He went on to criticise the \\"unwatchable shaky-cam technique\\" and \\"rough and amateurish\\" acting, though he did identify Swanberg's segment as the best. Likewise, Roger Ebert was among the critics who felt the film was overlong giving the film one star out of four and saying that \\"None of the segments is particularly compelling. Strung together, it's way too much of a muchness.\\" Sequels and spin-off A sequel, titled V/H/S/2, was rushed into production as early as October 2012, and debuted at Park City's Library Center Theatre on Saturday, January 19 as part of Sundance 2013. Much like its predecessor, the sequel involves a largely different group of directors: Jason Eisener (Hobo with a Shotgun), Gareth Evans (The Raid: Redemption), Timo Tjahjanto (Macabre), Eduardo S√°nchez and Gregg Hale (The Blair Witch Project), and franchise returnees Simon Barrett and Adam Wingard (respectively, writer and director of 2010's A Horrible Way to Die and the You're Next). It was as financially successful as the first film, and received higher critical praise. A third entry in the series, titled V/H/S: Viral, was released on Video on Demand on October 23, 2014, and in theatres on November 21 of the same year. The film's wraparound story involves a group of fame-obsessed teens who unwittingly become stars of the next internet sensation. The group of directors involved in V/H/S: Viral include Aaron Scott Moorhead, Nacho Vigalondo, Marcel Sarmiento, Gregg Bishop, and Justin Benson. A spin-off based on the segment Amateur Night, entitled Siren, was announced in 2015, with Hannah Fierman returning. Unlike the original, however, the spin-off does not use the found footage format. The film opened theatrically on December 2, 2016 to mostly positive reviews. A 4-episode miniseries V/H/S was released on Snap Originals on October 28, 2018. In June 2020, It was announced that a reboot \\"V/H/S94\\" is set to come. The reboot is said to take the franchise to a different direction. The number \\"94\\" refers the year 1994, which was the year of handheld cameras. The release date of the film is currently unknown.

Chonga is a Spanish-derived term used especially in South Florida, often to indicate a working-class, sexually liberated, very sassy, and emotionally expressive young woman. Chongas are also a distinct subculture, believed to have developed in Miami in the late 20th century. Members are typically young, working-class Hispanic women. In South Florida the term is usually considered a pejorative, though some young women are proud to identify themselves as such. While feminist scholarship on chongas is limited, early work by gender studies scholar Jillian Hernandez has suggested that the chonga identity is an \\"emerging icon\\", and that it can be empowering for working-class women. Etymology and meaning The intended meaning of the term \\"chonga\\" varies depending on the context in which it is used. The most specific meaning of the term denotes a member of the chonga subculture‚Äîyoung, usually working class and Latina women‚Äîwho dress and often act in a sexualized, brash, sometimes aggressive manner. The term also has three looser meanings: as a synonym for prostitute; to refer to a woman who acts \\"gangsta\\" or in a thug like manner; and among female friends, as a jovial way to greet each other, as an alternative to \\"girlfriend!\\"Hernandez 68.Lush 2007. Usage of the term to refer to young women is believed to have arisen in Miami, and only became prominent in the early 21st century. The same word has long been used in Latin American countries such as Peru and Ecuador to refer to a brothel; the modern US usage of the word may be related to this, or might have arisen independently among Floridian Cuban-Americans. \\"Chonga\\" has lexical similarities with several other Spanish terms, some of which have been in use for centuries. These include: * chola - used in the Southwestern United States for women of Mexican or Mexican-American descent, sometimes with the added meaning that they are a \\"homegirl\\" or someone from the streets. * chula - which denotes a cute or sexy young woman, whereas chulo is the male equivalent. * chusma - literally meaning snitch or gossiper, but can also denote a woman of low standing. That is to say, a Chusma or a Chula can be nouns to describe a chonga, but the three are not the same nor opposites. Example: \\"That chonga is such a chusma, she called the cops on Papi Chulo.\\" *\\"choni\\" is used in Spain (European Spanish) and refers (usually) to a young woman or man attempting to appear elegant and fashionable, but seen as vulgar or common. Also used humorously, as in adj. slang. Example: Where did get those choni boots? Chonga subculture According to the journalist Tamara Lush, Chonga subculture may have first appeared in Miami during the 1980s. Early chongas were usually Cuban teenagers whose parents had recently immigrated to the US. In the 1990s, chongas often wore white shorts with a colored thong underneath, basketball jerseys, and fake gold jewelry. Over the years the style evolved, with for instance tight jeans becoming more popular than shorts. =Chonga characteristics= 21st-century chongas will often exhibit at least some of the following characteristics: *Cheap but sexy clothing, which often includes \\"Brazilian jeans\\"Pocketless Skinny jeans that usually have an accentuating effect on the bottom. and revealing tops, a preference for gelled hair, visible thong showing, synthetic nails and gaudy jewelry, often including fake gold, bangles and earring hoops.Chongas sometimes like to have their names written on the hoops. *Sexual availability, often along with a preference to be surrounded by men. *Hostility to other young women, unless they are fellow members of the same chonga crew. *Loud, emotionally expressive and aggressive behavior.Hernandez passim, and esp. 85. Not all chongas live up to these stereotypes; for example, sometimes women whose conduct is the most overtly sexualized will in fact be among the least interested in actual heterosexual encounters‚Äîin some cases chonga behavior is perhaps best understood as a kind of bonding between female friends.Hernandez 85. =Depictions in the media= Until 2007, chongas have rarely appeared in the media, despite their high visibility in real life. One of the rare exceptions was the Cheerleaders (2000) set of art photographs by Luis Gispert.Hernandez 77-79.The cheerleader set of images on Gispert's web site. Not all pics feature chonga-like lasses; for an iconic image discussed at length in Hernandez, see pic no. 15. See also pic nos. 3, 9, 16 & 17. In popular culture, the few exceptions include Bratz dolls which have a chonga- like appearance; the chonga-like characters Lydia and Melina in the television comedy MADtv; and the chonga-like character Tina in the movie Do the Right Thing.Hernandez 65. Chongas became considerably more common in popular culture after the 2007 release of Chongalicious, a YouTube viral video. Hernandez noted that the only depiction she's aware of that accurately showed chongas in their social context was the 2007 \\"Bratz girls\\" exhibition by the GisMo Collective (Jessica Gispert and Crystal Molinary).Hernandez 68, 79-86. =In cultural and gender studies= According to a 2009 article by gender studies scholar Jillian Hernandez, feminist literature covering chongas remains sparse, even after their profile was raised by the Chongalicious video. Hernandez contrasts this with the extensive body of work on Chicana feminism, which explores the chola and chusma phenomena.Hernandez 86-87. Hernandez argues the chonga image has become iconic in Miami, and states that the aesthetic appeal of the chonga can be considerable, which in her opinion partly explains why the cheerleaders set of photographs was successful in launching Gispert's international career.Hernandez 80. The portrayal of chongas in the media can, however, be problematic, sometimes even repressive, as powerful negative images contribute to Latinas internalizing pressure to conform which originates from the dominant Anglo-American culture.Guzm√°n 2004. Stereotypical representations of chongas can play a role in the United States' wider culture wars, adding to concerns about the sexuality of some Latina women being \\"out of control\\" with their perceived high rate of reproduction.Guti√©rrez ch. 7. Citing earlier work by Isabel Molina Guzm√°n,Disorderly Bodies and Discourses of Latinidad in the Eli√°n Gonz√°lez Story, Isabel Molina Guzm√°n (2007) Hernandez relates this to the Eli√°n Gonz√°lez affair, where the media portrayal of Marisleysis Gonz√°lez as having the chonga-like characteristic of emotional excess contributed to the degradation of the privileged, \\"model minority status\\" that Cuban Americans had previously enjoyed.Hernandez 66. In her own research, Hernandez found that most people she questioned considered \\"chonga\\" a pejorative term. One respondent even went as far as to say the term sums up all the negative Latina stereotypes. A few asserted that while they know several chongas, they don't know any who self-identify as such. Sometimes Latina women will admit they went through a brief \\"chonga\\" phase in their early teens, but later came to view the style as uncool. Yet some chongas chose to retain the identity into their twenties. Hernandez also found that some young woman are proud to call themselves chongas. Several expressed pride in their sexual attractiveness. The creators of \\"Chongalicious\\", who are themselves middle class, found they had considerably more male attention while pretending to be chongas, one of them saying back in 2007 that \\"I think we would have boyfriends if we were real chongas.\\" Hernandez suggests that the chonga sub culture is in several ways a positive thing, representing women who are not shamed into invisibility by their low-class status or ethnic identity. She anticipates a broadening and deepening of feminist scholarship on chongas, to uncover the ways in which the chonga identity can be helpful to young women exploring their \\"bodies and pleasures\\".Hernandez notes that she is consciously echoing Michel Foucault in using the term \\"bodies and pleasures\\", as she sees it as a more empowering alternative to \\"sexuality\\".Hernandez passim, esp. 86-87.

It was an upper-middle-class neighborhood of two-story square houses and bungalows that were built from 1910 to 1923. The district has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2000. It is part of The Bungalow and Square House--Des Moines Residential Growth and Development MPS. History The Middlesex Plat is an infill area to the east of the western developments that had been built in the late 19th and early 20th century. The reason this plat had not been developed earlier was a lack of infrastructure. The Ingersoll Run sewer line was completed into northwest Des Moines in 1907. with The closest streetcar line was along University Avenue, which was a distance to the north, and other the lines in the Drake and Sherman Hill neighborhoods ended to the east of this area. They were extended at the time of the sewer lines. Another factor was that the property was owned by J. Callanan who kept the property off the real estate market in the late 19th century. Most of the houses in the district were built from 1910-1923. Those who promoted the development of the area were able to control it in order to maintain their promises to those who bought lots and the builders. Realtor Winner and Kauffman and house builders Henry Tillia and Charles Barnes were influential in the development of the area. Architecture The Middlesex Plat Historic District is largely composed of square houses and bungalows with a mixture of a variety of subtypes. Of the 293 properties in the district 187 are houses, of which only nine are not contributing because they were built more recently or substantially altered. There are also 106 detached garages in the district, of which 62 are contributing properties. The square houses outnumber the bungalows, and there are also 18 other houses that were built in another architectural style. Most of the square house plans have a front gabled roofs with a full-width front porch. Six of them were built before 1906 with most of them built between 1910-1911 and then 1914-1916. Three more houses were built in this style between 1917‚Äì18, with the last being built in 1923. The second largest subtype has a side-gabled roof. The peak year for construction of this type was 1910 when seven were built. Otherwise, two to three houses were started each year between 1906 and 1919. The last four houses in this subtype were built between 1919 and 1925. There were only nine American foursquare houses with a hip roof built in the district. All but two were built before 1911. The other two were built in 1916. Most of the bungalows feature a gable front with an offset front wing with a roof that is partly a continuation of the main roof. Of the 23 in this style, three were built before 1914 and 15 were built after 1918. Seven of the bungalows have a gabled front porch with a gabled side porch. Four more bungalows have a gabled front with a parallel gable front porch. One was built in 1911 and the rest were built in 1918. There are three \\"areoplane bungalows\\" that feature a gable front single story design that has a second story room or rooms that appear to be pushed up through the roof. Three bungalows feature a front gable with recessed full-width front porch (1918, 1921, 1923). Only one bungalow has a hipped roof (1908) and there is also one example of a \\"plain bungalow.\\" The remaining bungalows feature a side gable. Of these, 14 have a single roof pitch with a full-width front porch. They were built beginning in 1910 with the last being built in 1921. There are 16 more bungalows that feature a less than full-width front porch. They can be further divided into two subgroups because of their influences from either the American Craftsman or the Colonial styles. The Colonials, for the most part, were built later in the time period. The remaining 18 houses follow the Tudor Revival, Colonial Revival or the Prairie Style. Except for the house that had a basement level garage, there are few examples of early garages. Because they post-date the period being studying they do not contribute to the historic nature of the district. There are also no alleys in the district and the narrow lots also limited garage construction. Seven of the garages are attached to the houses and 29 are basement garages.

Patton et al. (also captioned v. Becker), 1:2008cv01425, is an ongoing case in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in which three publishers, Cambridge University Press, SAGE Publications, and Oxford University Press, initially filed suit in 2008 against Georgia State University for copyright infringement. The plaintiffs claimed that Georgia State University engaged in \\"systematic, widespread and unauthorized copying and distribution of a vast amount of copyrighted works\\" through its e-reserves system. Georgia State asserted that its system did not infringe copyright because its uses were fair use. The district court issued a 350-page findings of fact and conclusions of law on 11 May 2012, finding that in almost all cases the alleged infringements were fair use.Cambridge University Press v. Patton, No. 08-01425 (D.Ga. May 11, 2012). In a subsequent decision the court deemed that Georgia State University was the prevailing party and ordered the plaintiffs to pay GSU's attorney's fees.Steve Kolowich, 'The Prevailing Party', Inside Higher Ed (13 August 2012). The plaintiffs characterized the decision as \\"flawed\\" but not a \\"loss\\",Andrew Albanese, \\"Publishers Appeal 'Flawed' Decision in GSU E-Reserves Case\\", Publishers Weekly, 11 September 2012. and filed an appeal.See Publishers Brief in appeal, filed 2013. The costs of the litigation were funded in large part by the Copyright Clearance Center, a licensing company which funded 50% of the litigation and announced plans to continue to do so on appeal, and the Association of American Publishers (AAP). On 17 October 2014, the 11th Circuit reversed and remanded to the lower court for reconsideration in light of its opinion. The 11th Circuit reversed the grant of attorney's fees, and closely examined the lower court's 300-plus page fair use decision in their own 129-page decision, affirming and reversing various portions of the District Court's analysis. On 31 March 2016, the lower court issued its decision on remand, finding this time 4 of 49 to be infringements, and again awarding costs and attorneys' fees to Georgia State University as the prevailing party. Pre-trial Cambridge University Press, SAGE Publications, and Oxford University Press filed the lawsuit on 15 April 2008. They named four Georgia State officials as the defendants. The plaintiffs alleged that Georgia State made over 6,700 works available through its e-reserves system and website. They also alleged that the university \\"invit[ed] students to download, view, and print such materials without permission of the copyright holder.\\" The plaintiffs alleged direct, vicarious, and contributory infringement. They filed for summary judgment on all three claims, and Georgia State submitted counter-motions for summary judgment. On 17 February 2009, the Georgia Board of Regents changed the challenged e-reserve system, making it more similar to peer institutions. Following this change, on 22 June 2009, the university was granted a court order that limited discovery to the university's ongoing conduct. On 1 October 2010, Judge Orinda Evans granted summary judgment in favor of Georgia State on the claims of direct and vicarious infringement. She granted summary judgment on direct infringement because there was not enough evidence to show that any of the four named defendants engaged in acts of infringement. She also granted summary judgment on vicarious infringement because there was no evidence the named defendants profited from the alleged infringement of librarians working under them. The plaintiffs then submitted a partial motion for reconsideration. The judge granted it, allowing the vicarious infringement claim to go forward under a theory of indirect liability. Money damages were not at issue in the case. Under the doctrine of state sovereign immunity, the plaintiffs could only seek injunctive relief against Georgia State. =Reaction to the initial lawsuit= Both librarians and publishers are watching this case for its implications for broader conflicts about fair use and copyright infringement in the education community. As universities replace traditional printed resources with electronic course resources (either in the form of e-reserves or electronic course packs), publishers have sought to limit unlicensed uses in these forms. Similar cases have been filed against universities, including UCLA, and in other countries, York University,Michael Geist, \\"Access Copyright's Desperate Declaration of War Against Fair Dealing\\", 9 April 2013. Delhi University,\\"HC impleads students in copyright case\\", The Asian Age, 14 March 2013. and New Zealand.Jody O'Callaghan, \\"Universities refuse to pay extra copyright licence fees\\", Stuff.co.nz, 3 August 2013. In Seattle, a lawsuit was filed against a commercial copyshop serving Seattle University. The District Court distinguished the university, a nonprofit educational institution directly serving its users, from the commercial copyshops found to have infringed copyright in two cases in the early 1990s. Academic librarians and their lawyers have described the case as a \\"nightmare scenario.\\" Barbara Fister, a librarian at Gustavus Adolphus College, has suggested that the plaintiffs have lost sight of their missions, which include furthering education and scholarship. Similarly, Paul Courant, University Librarian and dean of libraries at the University of Michigan, has argued that the plaintiffs in this suit are in danger of becoming enemies, rather than simply adversaries, of libraries and authors. Kevin Smith, the director of scholarly communications at Duke University, has said that a broad holding in the plaintiffs' favor would have \\"catastrophic consequences,\\" either limiting the information that students can read or greatly increasing the cost of higher education. Both Fister and Smith also suggest that a narrow interpretation of fair use could lead more professors and academic authors to embrace the open access movement. Publishers and their representatives also feel that the stakes are very high. Tom Allen, president and CEO of the Association of American Publishers, has written that Georgia State's policy \\"invited disregard for basic copyright norms\\" and would threaten copyright's incentives for producing original work. Allen emphasized that educational purpose is not enough for a finding of fair use‚Äîother factors also enter the analysis. He also wrote that Georgia State's practices, if universalized, could bring down the entire \\"creative ecosystem.\\" Sandy Thatcher, then the executive editor for social sciences and humanities at Penn State University Press, commented in 2010 that the loss of revenue from the unlicensed electronic use of copyrighted material limited the University Press's ability to publish new books. Trial The trial began on 17 May 2011 and ended on 8 June 2011. After hearing the plaintiffs' arguments, Judge Evans granted the defendants' motion for a directed verdict on the claim of contributory infringement. The defendants' arguments largely related to fair use. The parties filed their final post-trial briefs later that summer. The district court issued a 350-page findings of fact and conclusions of law on 11 May 2012, a ruling that was appealed to the Eleventh Circuit. The Court found that most uses considered were fair use, considering the purpose of the use (nonprofit educational), the nature of the works (scholarly and factual), the amount taken (often less than 10%), and the effect on the market (little or to none known especially where there was no license available for electronic excerpts). Of the other allegations, the Court dismissed some as de minimis (because no students had in fact used the reserve copies), and dismissed others because the plaintiffs could not show that they actually owned the copyrights. Specific factual fightings included the Court determining that the relevant length of the work was the entire work, not individual chapters or portions of works, and a finding \\"that no book sales were lost.\\"\\"Plaintiffs offered no trial testimony or evidence showing that they lost any book sales in or after 2009 on account of any actions by anyone at Georgia State. The Court finds that no book sales were lost.\\" Cambridge University Press v. Becker, at 217. Based on the overwhelming number that were found to be noninfringing, the Court held Georgia State to be the \\"prevailing party\\", and awarded attorney's fees to Georgia State.  First Appeal  The plaintiffs appealed to the 11th Circuit, which heard oral arguments in the fall of 2013. On 17 October 2014, the 11th Circuit reversed and remanded to the lower court for reconsideration in light of its opinion. The 11th Circuit reversed the grant of attorney's fees, and closely examined Judge Evans' 300-plus page fair use decision in their own 129-page decision. They affirmed the lower court's holdings on the first factor, finding that the course reserves were not transformative, but that nonprofit educational uses are favored under fair use.11th Circuit, p.74. They reversed the lower court on the second fair use factor, requiring a closer examination of the original works and the relative composition of original analysis data.11th Circuit, pp. 75-81. However, they noted that this factor \\"is of relatively little importance in this case.\\"11th Circuit, p. 81. On the third factor, the 11th Circuit held that the lower court had erred in establishing a strict quantitative test for the \\"amount and substantiality taken\\".11th Circuit, pp. 82-92. Evans had suggested that less than 10% or one chapter in ten would be considered fair use; more than that, perhaps not. The 11th Circuit held that per se rules were not appropriate, and that the third factor had to be considered separately in light of the first and fourth factors. On the fourth factor, the 11th Circuit agreed with the lower court that \\"the small excerpts Defendants used do not substitute for the full books from which they were drawn,\\"11th Circuit, p. 94. and ultimately found \\"that the District Court's analysis under the fourth factor was correct, and that the District Court properly took license availability into account in determining whether the fourth factor weighted for or against fair use.\\"11th Circuit, p. 101. The publishers had argued that the District Court had erroneously shifted the burden of proof to plaintiffs on the question of license availability, but the 11th Circuit found no error on this point.11th Cir, p. 101-104. Instead, the Court held that requiring plaintiffs to produce evidence of availability was \\"reasonable\\", since \\"Plaintiffs‚Äìas publishers‚Äìcan reasonably be expected to have the evidence as to availability of licenses for their own works.\\"11th Circuit, pp. 101-102. After such evidence is presented, defendants still \\"retain[] the overall burden of persuasion on the fourth factor\\".11th Circuit, p. 102-103. The 11th Circuit also held that \\"the District Court did not err in performing a work-by-work analysis of individual instances of alleged infringement.\\"11th Circuit, p. 110. However, the 11th Circuit held that \\"the District Court did err by giving each of the four fair use factors equal weight, and by treating the four factors mechanistically.\\" The 11th Circuit vacated the injunction and declaratory relief, and the award of attorney's fees and costs, and remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.11th Circuit, p. 112. District Court Judge Vinson, sitting on this panel, wrote a concurrence in which he disagreed with several of the majority's holdings.11th Circuit, p. 113-129. The concurrence reads more like a dissent, including language that asserts the notion of fair use originally was a common law creation and thus \\"fair use analysis does not require conventional statutory interpretation.\\"11th Circuit, p. 114.  Subsequent proceedings  On remand, the District Court applied the 11th Circuit's guidance, and ultimately found even fewer infringements (four in total)Order of April 14, 2016, amending order of March 31, 2016. and again awarded attorney's fees.Order of July 29, 2016. The plaintiffs again appealed to the 11th Circuit, which in October 2018 held that the District Court had been too mechanistic in its approach to fair use and remanded for a third review.Cambridge University Press v.

Many of the deaths were due to the police's refusal to open the stadium gates, trapping the Ahly fans inside, leaving some to die, and killing others in a stampede to escape. Civil unrest and severe clashes continued until 11 February but general strikes ended on 13 February. Riots erupted in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Luzon. Police fired tear gas at protesters thus clashes erupted on the streets due to battles of tear gas. Unrest calmed and ended on 13 February. Seventy-three defendants, including 9 police officers and 2 officials from Port Said's Al-Masry club, were charged in the aftermath of the riots. As of February 2017, 10 defendants have been sentenced to death and 26 have been acquitted, including 7 police officers and an Al-Masry club official. Of the remaining 37 defendants, 10 received 15-year prison terms, 9 received 10-year sentences, and 16 received 5-year sentences including the remaining 2 police officers and an Al-Masry club official. One defendant received a 1-year sentence and a retrial has been ordered for a defendant sentenced to death in absentia in June 2015. As a result of the riot, the Egyptian government shut down the domestic league for two years, which affected the Egyptian national team.Government ban 'threatens future of Egyptian football, 16 July 2012 Incident The match kick-off was delayed thirty minutes because Al-Masry fans were on the pitch. During half-time and after each of the three second-half goals for Al-Masry, the club's supporters stormed the pitch, and at the conclusion of the match, thousands of spectators ran onto the playing field. Masry fans threw bottles and fireworks at Ahly players, who fled to their changing rooms under police protection. The Masry fans were armed with stones and some carried knives. In the ensuing melees, 74 people were killed. Some were stabbed and clubbed, while others were thrown off the stands or died in the stampede as they were trying to escape through a closed stadium gate in the back of the stands. Hisham Sheha, an official in the Egyptian health ministry, said the deaths were caused by stab wounds, brain hemorrhages, and concussions. Over 500 were injured. At least 470 Al- Masry fans were initially arrested and 73 eventually faced trial. Ahly coach Manuel Jos√© was kicked and punched by Masry fans while attempting to return to his locker room. He was afterwards taken to a police station. Both Jos√© and Mohamed Aboutrika reported that they witnessed Ahly fans die in Ahly locker room. As an immediate reaction to the disaster, Aboutrika decided to retire from football, along with other Egyptian international football stars Mohamed Barakat and Emad Moteab, while Al-Ahly coach Manuel Jos√© seriously considered leaving Egypt and retiring from coaching football. (in Portuguese) Video footage appears to show that the police were unable or unwilling to contain the attackers. Eyewitnesses said that the police \\"did nothing to stop it\\", and \\"refused to open the closed gates\\" to allow the crowds to escape. The bureau chief of the Voice of America in Egypt received reports that police opened the barriers separating the Al-Ahly and Al-Masry supporters. Another witness said that many people were allowed into the stadium without tickets. The New York Times reported that a major factor in the riots was retaliation on the part of the authorities towards the Ultras Ahlawy, who were actively involved in Tahrir Square during the 2011 Egyptian revolution protests and during SCAF Chairman Mohamed Hussein Tantawi‚Äôs rule as they kept chanting anti-government revolutionary chants in almost all Ahly games in the Egyptian Premier League. Reactions The BBC reported the Egyptian deputy health minister described it \\"the biggest disaster in the country's football history.\\" The Parliament of Egypt called for an emergency session to be held on 2 February 2012 to discuss a response. A scheduled match between Zamalek and Ismaily was cancelled due to the Port Said deaths. Subsequent matches of the 2011‚Äì12 Egyptian Premier League were postponed following the disaster. On 10 March 2012, the Egyptian Football Association announced the cancellation of the remainder of the season. A spokesperson for the Egyptian Football Association said the decision was made because there was insufficient time to play the remaining games before the national team was scheduled to compete in the 2012 Olympics and qualifiers for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. FIFA President Sepp Blatter issued a statement that read: In an interview with British writer Islam Issa, Al-Masry's captain Karim Zekri and his brother, former Masry player Mohamed Zekri, said that the police, army, and ex-regime incited the massacre. They added that there were numerous factors suggesting that it was planned, including the lack of searching and ticket inspection outside the stadium, the floodlights switching off, the welding shut of the away stand's gate, and the arrival of thugs from outside. Al-Ahly coach Manuel Jos√© also said that the whole massacre was orchestrated. He said that at the north end of the stadium there was a banner that said, in English: \\"We are going to kill you all\\", a slogan which he thought was directed at the international media and not at the teams. He said that the gates at the south end, where the Al-Ahly fans were located, were locked and some fans died of asphyxiation there. He criticized the police, saying that they were sitting down rather than facing the pitch, and did nothing to stop the repeated pitch invasions during the match. Jos√© considered retiring the team at half-time and said that the referee should have cancelled the match then. He stated that he saw everyone going towards the Al-Ahly end and saw people falling off the stands. He was taken to a VIP room and tried to return to the locker room, but it was impossible to get there. He reported that four people died in the Al-Ahly locker room. Jos√© said he wished to remain at Al-Ahly for a couple more years before retiring, saying that he likes living there, loves the club, and is treated very well. ESPN.com columnist Brent Latham described the riot as being politically motivated: Alleged political involvement Following the incident, anti-government political activists accused the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) and remnants of the old regime still in positions of power, asserting that the events were of a \\"counter revolutionary\\" nature. Activists cited a rise in crime levels in the week leading up to the event as evidence that the violence had been organized (in Cairo and Helwan: two bank robberies and the heist of an armored vehicle transporting money. In Sharm el-Sheikh: an armed robbery in a currency exchange led to the murder of a French tourist). The violence in Port Said took place on the eve of the first anniversary of what later became known as \\"the battle of the camel\\", when armed thugs stormed protesters in Tahrir Square on camel-back. This was seen by activists as a last-ditch effort by the ruling party to assert control and spread fear of chaos (Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president at the time, having warned, in a televised speech on 1 February 2011, of \\"chaos\\" if he was to step down). People who attended the game stated that, in contrast with normal procedures, no security searches were conducted at the stadium entrances, allowing makeshift weapons to be smuggled in. Eyewitnesses claimed that the attending security personnel took no action to prevent or mitigate the clashes. There were other claims that the gates of the stadium were locked shut, locking the minority Al-Ahly supporters in. Al-Ahly ultras claim that they were specifically targeted given their vocal highly televised calls for the SCAF to step down, as well as their open mockery of the previous regime and the SCAF. The ultras were one of the largest organized bodies of resistance in street protests after the absence of the Muslim Brotherhood following parliamentary elections. Trials 73 defendants, including 9 police officers and 2 officials from Port Said's Al-Masry club, were charged in the killing of 72 Ahly football club fans. On 26 January 2013, Port Said Criminal Court, convening at the Police Academy in New Cairo for security reasons, issued preliminary death sentences to 21 defendants. A verdict against the other 52 defendants was postponed to 9 March 2013. There was an outburst of emotion from the families of the defendants when the judge announced the preliminary death sentences, requiring him to ask for order in the court several times. Some parents fainted from shock. The Ahly ultras celebrated the verdict by carrying out demonstrations praising the sentence in front of their club branch in Zamalek and demanding the conviction of officers who were involved in the disaster. They then moved their demonstration to the Ministry of Interior headquarters to assert their demands of prosecuting the officers, resulting in clashes with the police who shot tear gas to disperse the protestors. The people of Port Said saw the verdict as a political decision rather than a fair trial. Several Port Said officials announced their condemnation on various TV channels. Some of the defendants' families and the Masry ultras gathered around the prison in Port Said while others went to block the main Mohamed Ali Street leading to the Port Said Governorate headquarters. A third group blocked the gates of a major textile industrial complex that employs about 20,000 workers. Amid the death sentence protests in Port Said, clashes erupted between pro-defendants' protestors and security forces near Port Said General Prison which left as many as two police officers and 40 civilians killed and over 250 were injured. On 9 March 2013, the court confirmed the 21 death sentences issued on 26 January. Of the remaining 52 defendants, 5 received life sentences, 10 received 15-year sentences including 2 police officers, the former Port Said security director Essam Samak and the head of the Port Said water bodies security department, Mohamed Saad. 6 defendants received 10-year sentences, 2 received 5-year sentences, and 1 received a 1-year sentence. The remaining 28 defendants were acquitted including the other 7 police officers charged. They include the former head of Port Said police investigation department, Mostafa Razaz, former head of the Central Security Forces in the Suez Canal area, Abdel-Aziz Sami, and former head of Port Said national security directorate, Bahy El-Din Zaghloul. The other four police officers were all aides to these senior officials. Also acquitted are the only two officials from Port Said's Al-Masry club who were charged ‚Äî Major General Mohsen Sheta who was executive director of Al-Masry club at the time of the events, and former head of security at the club Mohamed El-Desouki. Both the defendants and the prosecution appealed the verdicts. On 6 February 2014, Egypt's Court of Cassation ordered the retrial of 64 defendants and rejected the appeals of 9 defendants who were sentenced between 1 and 10 years in prison. On 19 April 2015, 11 defendants were issued preliminary death sentences in the retrial. The court postponed the verdict on the remaining 53 defendants. On 9 June 2015, the court confirmed the 11 death sentences and acquitted 21 defendants. Of the remaining 32 defendants, 10 received 15-year sentences, 9 received 10-year sentences, and 13 received 5-year sentences including the 2 police officers who were initially sentenced to 15-years in prison, and 1 official from Port Said's Al-Masry club, Mohsen Sheta, who was previously acquitted. On 23 August 2015, the court upheld a death sentence issued in absentia to 1 defendant and acquitted 5 of 6 other defendants sentenced in absentia to 10-year prison terms. The remaining defendant had his 10-year sentence issued in absentia reduced to 5 years on 15 November 2015. On 20 February 2017, Egypt's Court of Cassation upheld 10 death sentences issued in June 2015 and ordered a retrial for 1 defendant convicted in absentia.

Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d 159 (2d Cir. 2010), is a United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit case in which defendants Raj Rajaratnam and Danielle Chiesi appealed a discovery order issued by a district court during a civil trial against them for insider trading filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The district court compelled the defendants to disclose to the SEC the contents of thousands of wiretapped conversations that were originally obtained by the United States Attorney's Office (USAO) and were turned over to the defendants during a separate criminal trial. The Second Circuit court held that although it is lawful to order such a disclosure, and the SEC indeed had a right to access the conversations in preparation for the civil trial, the district court exceeded its discretion by failing to limit the disclosure to conversations relevant to the current case. Citing the significant privacy implications of such a disclosure, the Second Circuit court granted a writ to vacate the discovery order, and remanded the case back to the district court.SEC v. Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d 159 (2nd Cir. 2010) (opinion full text). Background On October 16, 2009, the defendants (Rajaratnam and Chiesi) were arrested and indicted for insider trading and conspiracy. The charges stemmed from an investigation by the United States Attorney's Office into allegations that Rajaratnam and Chiesi conspired in insider trading of stock for several large companies. Rajaratnam was found guilty on all 14 charges and sentenced to 11 years in prison. Chiesi was sentenced to 30 months in prison with 2 years of supervised release. During the discovery phase of the criminal trial, the USAO turned over to the defendants the contents of 18,150 wiretapped communications involving 550 different people, which were recorded over the course of sixteen months from ten telephones, including home, office and mobile lines belonging to the defendants. =Civil Case= On the same day the USAO filed criminal charges against the defendants, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil case against them based on the same allegations, claiming that the defendants engaged in \\"widespread and repeated insider trading\\" at several hedge funds, including the now-defunct Galleon Group, during which time they received tips from insiders regarding \\"market moving events such as quarterly earnings announcements, takeovers, and material contracts\\" and allegedly used that information to earn over $25 million in illegal profits.SEC v. Galleon Management, LP, et al., 09 Civ. 8811 (complaint). The SEC was not given the contents of the wiretaps, since the USAO had no legal right to share them. The SEC instead attempted to obtain the wiretap contents by ordering the defendants, who had obtained a copy during the criminal trial, to turn them over during discovery in the civil case. The defendants objected, claiming that such disclosure was prohibited by Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (), which governs the authorization of wiretaps and provides limits on how and under what conditions the contents of wiretaps can be shared and disclosed. The district court dismissed the objection, noting that the defendants had already shared the wiretap contents with other defendants as part of a joint defense agreement. The district court ordered the defendants to disclose the wiretapped conversations to the SEC, declaring that \\"the notion that only one party to a litigation should have access to some of the most important non-privileged evidence bearing directly on the case runs counter to basic principles of civil discovery in an adversary system\\".SEC v. Galleon Management, LP, et al., 09 Civ. 8811 (discovery order). The defendants appealed this order to the Second Circuit court. =Appeal of Disclosure Order= In their objection to the discovery order, the defendants argued that Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 forbids implicitly (i.e., because it does not explicitly permit) forced disclosure of wiretap materials during discovery phase in civil cases when the wiretap materials were obtained from separate criminal cases. They additionally claimed that the wiretaps were illegal since Title III does not specifically authorize wiretaps for investigations into insider trading or securities fraud. The defendants also argued that the SEC did not constitute an \\"aggrieved person\\" for the purposes of demonstrating \\"good cause\\" for disclosure of the fruits of wiretapping, as required by Title III. Finally, they argued that even if the SEC had good cause to obtain the wiretap contents, Title III still prohibited the disclosure, since it prohibited the USAO from providing the wiretap contents directly to the SEC (a contention that neither the USAO nor SEC disputed) and this, in turn, implicitly barred the SEC from obtaining the wiretap contents from the defendants. The SEC argued that they had a right to access the materials and, pursuant to United States v. Miller, the discovery order could be remedied by the defendants on appeal. Appeals Court Ruling The Second Circuit court ruled on four separate issues: whether they had appellate jurisdiction to review the district court's order, whether a writ of mandamus was appropriate to vacate the order, whether Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 prohibits discovery orders in civil trials (in general), and whether the district court exceeded its discretion in issuing the order in this particular instance. =Interlocutory Jurisdiction= The court concluded that they lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal of the discovery order issued by the district court. This decision was based on an interpretation of a prior ruling by the same court in In re City of New York, during which the court ruled that they lacked interlocutory jurisdiction to review any orders \\"allegedly adverse to a claim of privilege or privacy\\" and that, despite the disagreement between the parties about how to categorize the discovery order being challenged, it did not fit in the category of claims that the Supreme Court has previously ruled are subject to interlocutory orders‚Äîprejudgement orders that are \\"collateral to the merits of an action\\" and \\"too important to be denied immediate review\\".Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp, 337 U.S. 541 (1949). =Writ of Mandamus= The court noted that even though they lacked interlocutory jurisdiction to review the discovery order, a writ of mandamus was still appropriate to prevent the disclosure because of the privacy issues at stake. The court disagreed with the SEC's interpretation of the United States v. Miller ruling, citing the fact that in the present case, the privacy rights of hundreds of innocent individuals was at risk if the wiretaps were forced to be disclosed‚Äîin contrast to United States v. Miller, where the tapes had already been played at trial and consequently, the only issue at stake was the protection against unlawful interception. The court noted that in the present case, \\"the cat is not yet out of the bag\\" and a writ was appropriate if the disclosure order was deemed erroneous, since no alternative remedies would be available to the defendants (in particular, an appeal of the ruling after the case would not adequately vindicate the privacy violations). The court explicitly limited the scope of their finding to the present facts, noting that the ruling \\"does not mean that a writ of mandamus will always be appropriate to remedy an erroneous disclosure order\\". =Title III Provisions= The court rejected the defendants' claim that Title III forbids the forced disclosure of wiretapped communications, concluding that such disclosure is permitted \\"where the defendants have received those conversations lawfully\\". In response to the argument that Title III provides no explicit provision for disclosures under the present facts, the court noted that \\"[Title III] does not prohibit all that it does not permit\\". Regarding the defendants' claim that the order is indirectly prohibited, the court determined that \\"Title III does not prohibit the disclosure of wiretap materials in a situation such as this one: where the government has previously disclosed the contents of wiretaps to a party, and a civil enforcement agency seeks access to those contents from that party, not from the government\\". The court cautioned that although it determined that such a disclosure, in general, is not unlawful based on Title III, this did not imply that the discovery order in the current case was legal. =District Court Order= The court noted that in issuing the discovery order, the district court was obliged to determine both whether the SEC had a right to access the wiretap contents, and whether that right outweighed the privacy implications of such a disclosure. They found that while the district court was correct in determining that the SEC had a right to the materials, it was incorrect in its determination that this right outweighed the privacy implications‚Äîespecially since the district court did not first ascertain the legality of the wiretaps or limit the discovery order to conversations relevant to the current case. The court cited a previous Supreme Court ruling in Gelbard v. United States that \\"although Title III authorizes invasions of individual privacy under certain circumstances, the protection of privacy [is] an overriding congressional concern\\".Gelbard v. United States, 408 U.S. 41 (1972) (opinion full text). The Second Circuit court felt that the district court had an obligation to wait until a court had ruled on the legality of the wiretaps before issuing the discovery order. They also felt that even if the wiretaps were determined to be legal, the irrelevant conversations from the wiretap did not fit within the scope of fair pre-trial discovery since they would not benefit the SEC in the civil case. Consequently, the Second Circuit court ruled that the district court \\"clearly exceeded its discretion\\" in ordering the discovery; owing to their decision that a writ of mandamus was the only effective remedy for such a circumstance, they granted a writ to vacate the discovery order and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings consistent with thei.

Such referenda have frequently been proposed as a means by which the majority of the voting public in a polity, rather than the judicial or legislative chambers of government, could determine what the state should recognize or carry out, while such referenda have been strongly criticized by civil rights organizations and professional bodies as means by which the majority of the public could vote on the rights of a vulnerable minority according to contemporary prejudices. United States =LGBT rights and Same-sex marriage= Civil rights referenda have been frequently proposed by those in ideological rejection against lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender rights, most often due to Abrahamic religious objections against homosexuality. In countries where governments have passed, activists have frequently sought to put either a repeal of the new LGBT-affirmative law or a (constitutional or statutory) ban on LGBT-affirmative activities or relationships, and often rely upon a core religious constituency in order to drive the advocacy for such a referendum. In the United States, civil rights referenda were held in the latter 1900s in order to prohibit same-sex unions (including marriage) and repeal amendments to human rights ordinances which included sexual orientations and gender identities as protected classes. The climax of such legislation was the passage of a record number of U.S. state constitutional amendments banning same-sex unions by referendum in 2004, which coincided with a large turnout for the re-election of George W. Bush to the presidency and Republican legislators to control of both houses of Congress. Among those who advocate for LGBT rights, the delegation of marriage and other rights to the \\"will of the people\\" has propelled the notion of preventing civil rights- related laws and proposals from going to the ballot. This notion was underscored in the aftermath of the passage of California Proposition 8 in California. =Race relations= In a 2000 Alabama referendum on repealing the 1901 state constitutional ban on interracial marriage, over 40% of the participating electorate voted against repealing the ban. While the ban was rendered unenforceable following Loving v. Virginia, the 40.51% of the populace voting against the repeal . In 1998, South Carolina voters voted 61.95%-38.05% in favor of repealing their own constitutional ban. Harvard University professor Werner Sollors intimated that the laws took so long after Loving to be repealed because of the complex clauses which required large majorities in order to repeal them. On January 26, 2012, in remarks accompanying his decision to veto the legalization of same-sex marriage by the State Legislature and call for a referendum on the matter, New Jersey governor Chris Christie remarked that \\"The fact of the matter is, I think people would have been happy to have a referendum on civil rights rather than fighting and dying in the streets in the South. It was our political institutions that were holding things back.\\" He was strongly criticized by politicians and activists of both African-American and other ancestries from both inside and outside of New Jersey, with Newark mayor Cory Booker stating \\"...dear God, we should not put civil rights issues to a popular vote to be subject to the sentiments and passions of the day. No minority should have their civil rights subject to the passions and sentiments of the majority.\\" Christie initially criticized the response of many legislators as a Democratic partisan ploy, but walked back his comments by apologizing for offense on February 1 while continuing to back his call for a referendum. =Women's suffrage= Women's suffrage was first brought forward as proposed legislation in the Kansas women's suffrage referendum, 1867. The proposal was defeated twice before passing.

Botticelli (born January 2, 1958) is an American public health official who served as the director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) from March 2014 until the end of President Obama's term. He was named acting director after the resignation of Gil Kerlikowske, and received confirmation from the United States Senate in February 2015. Prior to joining ONDCP, he worked in the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Following completion of his service as ONDCP Director, he became the executive director of the Grayken Center for Addiction Medicine at the Boston Medical Center. Early life and education Botticelli was born in Troy, New York and raised in Waterford, New York. He attended Catholic Central High School. He later received a Bachelor's degree in psychology from Siena College and a Masters in Education from St. Lawrence University. Botticelli began drinking alcohol regularly in his junior year of high school. By his 20s, he was an alcoholic. He also experimented with cocaine and marijuana. He was arrested for driving under the influence following a traffic collision on the Massachusetts Turnpike in 1988. A judge gave him the option of going into treatment or being sentenced to prison, and he chose to enter treatment. Career After achieving sobriety, Botticelli joined the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, in 1994. He worked as a coordinator for alcoholism programs from 1994 through 1995, as contract manager for HIV- related policies and services from 1995 through 1996, as an assistant director for policy and planning from 1996 through 2000, as the chief of staff to the public health commissioner from 2000 through 2003, and as director of substance abuse services from 2003 to 2012. In the latter role, he oversaw the pilot program for Quincy, Massachusetts, police to begin carrying naloxone to treat opioid overdose, and the expansion of substance abuse treatment services in community health centers. Gil Kerlikowske, serving as the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) under President Barack Obama, met Botticelli on a visit to Massachusetts and asked him to serve as deputy director. In March 2014, following Kerlikowske's confirmation as commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Botticelli became acting director. He is the first director of the ONDCP to be in recovery for substance use. The United States Senate confirmed Botticelli in February 2015 by a vote of 92-0. As director of ONDCP, Botticelli has advocated to expand the usage of naloxone, improved education for providers around prescription painkillers and providing clean syringes for injection drug users to limit the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C. Botticelli criticized the nation's previous approach to dealing with drug issues stating that \\"We can't arrest and incarcerate addiction out of people\\". He believes the focus should be on treatment rather than incarceration. He does, however, oppose free marijuana for its effects, for the publicity similar to tobacco it might get and for the dependency the states might get on its taxes. Following the end of the Obama administration, the Grayken Center for Addiction Medicine at the Boston Medical Center named Botticelli its executive director. Botticelli is a member of the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors. He has been an advisory committee member of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention.

Originally identified in fallen foliage of common ivy (Hedera helix) in Buenos Aires, it also causes leaf spot in Hypericum 'Hidcote' (Hypericum patulum) shrubs in Japan. Its polyurethane degradation activity was discovered in two distinct P. microspora strains isolated from plant stems in the Yasuni National Forest within the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest by a group of student researchers led by molecular biochemistry professor Scott Strobel as part of Yale's annual Rainforest Expedition and Laboratory. It's the first fungus species found to be able to subsist on polyurethane in anaerobic conditions. This makes the fungus a potential candidate for bioremediation projects involving large quantities of plastic. Pestalotiopsis microspora was originally described from Argentina in 1880 by mycologist Carlo Luigi Spegazzini, who named it Pestalotia microspora. In 1996 Julie C. Lee first isolated Torreyanic acid, a dimeric quinone, from P. microspora, and noted that the species is likely the cause of the decline of Florida torreya (Torreya taxifolia), an endangered species that is related to the paclitaxel-producing Taxus brevifolia.

He currently serves as the Montana State Auditor and Commissioner of Securities and Insurance. Previously, he was a member of the Montana Legislature. Rosendale is currently the Republican nominee in the 2020 election to represent Montana's at-large congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. Early life and career Rosendale spent his career working in real estate, real estate development, and land management. He grew his family real estate business from a single, small five agent office into a full-service firm with 65 agents and four offices. Rosendale and his wife moved their family to Glendive, Montana in 2002, where they raised their children.

He also was the primary sponsor of a bill which became law to prevent law enforcement from using drones for surveillance purposes. Based on Rosendale's voting record in the 2013 legislative session, he earned a 100% on the Montana Family Foundation's scorecard and was also named a \\"Champion of Business\\" by the Montana Chamber of Commerce. = 2015 session of the Montana State Senate and tenure as Senate Majority Leader = Due to state redistricting in 2014, Rosendale represented Senate District 18 for the remainder of his tenure.

During the session, Rosendale was the primary sponsor of a bill to authorize direct primary care provider plans which passed both houses of the legislature before being vetoed by Democratic Governor Steve Bullock. Rosendale's voting record in the 2015 session earned him perfect 100% scores on several organizations' scorecards including the Montana Family Foundation. He was the recipient of the American Conservative Union's \\"Award for Conservative Excellence\\" and was again named a \\"Champion of Business\\" by the Montana Chamber of Commerce.  2014 U.S. House of Representatives election  In 2013, incumbent Representative Steve Daines announced that he would not seek re-election and would instead run for the United States Senate. Following this, Rosendale announced he would be running to succeed him in the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition to Rosendale, the Republican field included former State Senators Ryan Zinke and Corey Stapleton, State Representative Elsie Arntzen, and real estate investor Drew Turiano. Rosendale came in third place with 28.8% of the vote, behind Zinke with 33.3% of the vote and Stapleton with 29.3% of the vote. Arntzen and Turiano received 6.9% and 1.7% respectively.  2016 State Auditor election  With State Auditor Monica Lindeen ineligible to run for re-election due to term limits, Rosendale decided to run for the open State Auditor position. Rosendale ran unopposed in the Republican primary. In the general election, Rosendale faced Jesse Laslovich, who was Chief Legal Counsel to State Auditor Monica Lindeen and was widely considered to be one of Montana's rising political stars. Despite being outspent 4:1, Rosendale defeated Democrat Jesse Laslovich receiving 53.6% of the vote to Laslovich's 46.4%. At the time, this was the most expensive State Auditor's race in Montana state history.  Tenure as State Auditor, Commissioner of Securities and Insurance  As State Auditor, Rosendale approved direct primary care and Medi-Share. He has refused to accept a pay raise every single year. As State Auditor, Rosendale is also one of five members of the Montana State Land Board, which oversees the 5.2 million acres in the state trust land. As a member of the Montana State Land Board, Rosendale voted to expand access to over of public land. In 2017, Rosendale proposed legislation which would create a reinsurance program so that individuals with pre-existing conditions could access affordable health coverage. This legislation passed both houses of the legislature before being vetoed by Governor Steve Bullock. Rosendale condemned Governor Bullock's veto stating, \\"the governor has sacrificed good, bipartisan policy in favor of bad, partisan politics.\\" Rosendale then worked with a bipartisan group of Montana officials to create a reinsurance program and were granted a waiver to do so by the federal government. The program is currently operational. In 2019, Rosendale proposed legislation targeting Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs) and a practice known as spread pricing. The legislation passed both houses of the legislature before being vetoed by Governor Steve Bullock.

Polls showed the race in a statistical tie going into election day, in what was the most expensive election in Montana history, with more than $70 million spent on both sides. Tester's campaign had a huge cash advantage, raising and spending $21 million to Rosendale's $6 million. In the general election, Tester won 50.3% of the vote to Rosendale's 46.8%, with Libertarian candidate Rick Breckenridge taking 2.9%. 2020 U.S. House of Representatives election In June 2019, Congressman Greg Gianforte announced that he would not be seeking re-election and would instead run for Governor to replace term-limited Governor Steve Bullock.

Now's Your Chance to Defend That 'Toon, The Washington Post, Sept. 16, 2009.\\"ID the Zombie comic character\\", The Straight Dope Message Board, 2010.03.12; accessed 2012.02.07. The strips are taken over by others, often relatives of the originator. Zombie comic strips are often criticized as lacking the \\"spark\\" that originally made the strip successful.  Reasons and criticism  The usual reason for continuing a strip as a zombie is to keep the profitable business or franchise going, preserving a number of jobs and allowing future generations to enjoy the work in a new form. Both the creator's relatives and the strip's syndicate stand to make significant money in royalties. In the early days of comic strips, it was commonplace for a strip to be taken over by successors once the original cartoonist died; one of the earliest high-profile cartoonists to reject \\"zombie stripping\\" was George Herriman, who decreed that his strip Krazy Kat not be continued after his death. (Herriman, along with his strip, died in 1944.)Schwartz, Ben (2003). \\"Hearst, Herriman, and the Death of Nonsense.\\" Printed in Krazy & Ignatz 1929‚Äì1930: \\"A Mice, A Brick, A Lovely Night.\\" (q.v.) The practice of continuing a zombie comic strip is commonly criticized by cartoonists, particularly younger ones in the new generation, including Bill WattersonBill Watterson, \\"The Cheapening of the Comics \\", speech delivered at the Festival of Cartoon Art, Ohio State University, October 27, 1989; accessed 2012.02.02.Dave Kellett, \\"Festival of Cartoon Art \\", Sheldon Comics, March 8, 2010; accessed 2012.02.02. and Stephan Pastis. Pastis addressed the issue in his strip, Pearls Before Swine, in 2005.E.g. September 20‚Äì24, 2005, \\"Pearls Before Swine\\", Comics.com Mark Tatulli also commented on zombie strips in his strip Li≈ç in 2010.\\"Li≈ç\\", March 12, 2010 and in 2013.\\"Li≈ç\\", April 3, 2013 After an incident in which United Feature Syndicate secretly retained the services of superhero comic artist Al Plastino to continue the comic strip Peanuts in case of an interruption, Charles Schulz, author and creator of Peanuts, requested that his strip (which, in contrast to most comic strips today, he drew completely on his own with no assistants of any kind)Yoe, Craig, Clean Cartoonists' Dirty Drawings. San Francisco, Calif.: Last Gasp, 2007, p. 36; Michaelis, David, Schulz and Peanuts: A Biography. New York: HarperPerennial, 2008, p. ix. not be continued by another cartoonist after his death; Schulz's family (as well as Universal Uclick, which currently holds the strip's publication rights) has honored his wishes. Since Schulz's death in 2000, Peanuts has continued in reruns under the title Classic Peanuts. The principal criticism directed toward continuing a zombie strip is that the replacement cartoonist is seen as generally less funny or less inspired than the creator (\\"still stumbling around decades after their original creators have retired or died\\"),Rob Bricken, \\"The 10 Newspaper Comic Strips that Need to F**king End\\", Topless Robot, September 18, 2008; accessed 2012.02.06. or that the new cartoonist does not have the same style of writing or understand the characters as well. The death of the cartoonist and the strip's succession into zombie status thus is akin to the concept of \\"marrying Irving\\" or \\"jumping the shark\\", in that the strip never returns to the quality or popularity it had during the run by the original cartoonist. An additional criticism is that continuing such strips prevents newer cartoonists from entering the business by filling newspaper space that might be devoted to new strips.E.g., Zombie comic strips, The Straight Dope Message Board, June 2, 2009. However, in some cases, the new head cartoonist has often been the assistant of the former, as Dennis the Menace, after Hank Ketcham's retirement, was developed by his former assistants who have taken over. Often the new cartoonist has developed the strip over a few years. As another counterpoint, zombie strips can also provide proving grounds for unknown artists to prove their worth with an established brand; Jerry Scott began his national career as author of the zombie strip Nancy (and was given the artistic freedom to draw the strip in a style much different than his predecessor) before launching his own strips, Baby Blues and Zits.  Examples  Zombie strips include Adam@home, Andy Capp, Blondie, Dennis the Menace, B.C., The Wizard of Id, Frank and Ernest, Hi and Lois, H√§gar the Horrible, Dick Tracy, Rex Morgan, M.D., Mary Worth, Prince Valiant, The Family Circus, Shoe, Spy vs. Spy, Barney Google and Snuffy Smith, and Ginger Meggs. Now- defunct strips that were zombies for a time before being discontinued include Terry and the Pirates, Little Orphan Annie, and Brenda Starr. Lying somewhere in a gray area are strips that still have an association with their original author but receive significant assistance from others. The most widely known example of this is the widely syndicated Garfield, which was created and is still managed by Jim Davis but is currently written and drawn by staff at Paws, Inc., which handles his brand licensing rights, and as of 2019, is a subsidiary of ViacomCBS's Nickelodeon, which acquired the Garfield franchise in the same year. Another example are the multi-generational strips, such as B.C., The Wizard of Id, Hi and Lois, Beetle Bailey, and The Family Circus. In those cases, the strips in later years were drawn by the original author with other family members. Following the deaths of the original authors, the next generation in the family continued drawing (the Mastroianni brothers, the Walker brothers, and Jeff Keane). One example of zombie work outside of comic strips includes the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants, a series which continues to produce new episodes despite the death of creator Stephen Hillenburg in 2018. Hillenburg had largely stepped away from the show after 2004, but continued to serve as executive producer before returning to more active involvement in 2015 until his death.

After learning the Indian language, he was attached to a mission in the interior, but as he opposed the policy of the conquerors, which brought about the depopulation of the island, he was ordered to leave the country, and went to New Spain in 1526. There he was appointed guardian of the newly founded convent of Santiago de Tlatelolco, but subsequently he was sent to labor in Guatemala. In 1535 he was a member of the commission headed by Father Domingo Betanzos which laid before Pope Paul III the wretched condition of the Indians. Uhland, who was a Latinist of reputation, was instructed to speak before the congregation of the propaganda, and induced the pope to issue his celebrated bull entitled ‚ÄúVeritas Ipsa,‚Äù This for a time improved the condition of the Indians, but the prompters of the bull were never forgiven by the Spanish authorities, and Uhland, to avoid persecution, on his return to Mexico did not leave his convent until his death.

Published by Taylor and Francis. History The York Tramways Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1879. Construction started in July 1880 with a route to Fulford Village. The engineer was Joseph Kincaid. Initially the company hoped to operate a steam tramway and Major General Charles Scrope Hutchinson from the Board of Trade approved the use of steam power. However, the steam experiment must have been unsuccessful as the company eventually gave up and maintained the service with horse cars. Three routes were constructed from the city centre to Fulford Village, York railway station and Knavesmire. A new company, the City of York Tramways Company was formed in 1886. It was a subsidiary of the Imperial Tramways Company based in Bristol. It acquired the assets of the York Tramways Company for ¬£14,500 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). By 1891 the company operated 10 tramcars with a stable of 37 horses. Closure The system was taken over by York Corporation Tramways on 27 February 1909.

It is a member of the Indiana-Michigan Mennonite Conference of Mennonite Church USA. History Mennonites settled in Elkhart County, Indiana, beginning in 1839. In 1849 the first Mennonite log meeting house was built near the village of South West, and it was named Yellow Creek after a stream nearby. Bishop Martin Hoover, who moved to Indiana at age 85, died in 1850 and was replaced by Jacob Wisler, ordained bishop in 1851. In 1861, the congregation required a larger building and built a new structure across the road. Daniel Brenneman, known for his more evangelical theology, and John F. Funk, founder of the Herald of Truth, moved to the Elkhart area in 1864 and 1867 respectively. These two ordained men were known as able preachers and often preached in English, rather than the German language. Because of his skill in English, Brenneman was in great demand in frontier Indiana for funeral services. Difficulties between the progressive and the conservative preachers, including Jacob Wisler (1808-1889), Daniel Brenneman, John Funk, as well as Joseph Rohrer and Joseph Holdeman, resulted in the expulsion of the conservative preachers, first Rohrer and Holdeman, and then Wisler in 1872. Jacob Wisler was then instrumental in the forming of the Ohio-Indiana Mennonite Conference, also called Wisler Mennonites. About 100 church members sided with Jacob Wisler. In 1874 Daniel Brenneman was also expelled. John F. Funk was ordained bishop in 1892, serving for a decade until 1902 when church politics forced him to retire from active preaching. After this division, the Wisler and Funk branches shared the Yellow Creek building, holding services there on alternating Sundays until 1912. Today Today, Yellow Creek has an average attendance of 400-425. Beginning in 2005, Yellow Creek has hosted an annual Carnival as a Halloween alternative. Yellow Creek Mennonite has partnered with the ecumenical Wakarusa Ministerial Association to hold joint community services for Good Friday, Easter Sunrise, and Thanksgiving. Services are held every Sunday at 9 a.m. with Sunday school following at 10:30. Sunday evening services are held for community hymn sings, the Christmas service, Service trip reports, and special music events. Yellow Creek's institutional records are held at the Mennonite Church USA Archives in Goshen, Indiana.

Population: 250 History The community has existed since the second part of the 20th century, and was established back in 1968.

First settlers were architects, developers and military people. Major renovations started in 1994 when an asphalt road was created from Nikolina Gora straight to the village. In the beginning of the 2000s water pipes & electricity systems have been replaced with new systems. A new gas system had been deployed in the village for selected households enabling permanent living in both winter months as well as in summer months. With landlines connected to several houses Internet access became available to the Gradostroitel citizens. Geography Gradostroitel' is bordered by Nikolina Gora to the south and SNT Lira to the north. Unincorporated federal woods area lies to the west and east. Gradostroitel' is located at . Government and politics Gradostroitel' has a non-partisan chairman-board form of government, with the chairman and several board members elected at large for staggered two-year terms. The last chairman, Svetlana Mishina, had been in office since 2009. The current one, Lubov' Ovcharova, won the last elections back in Summer of 2011, though there are rumors that those elections were fabricated. =Current Chair= Lubov' Ovcharova is Gradostroitel's latest chairman. She started her first term as Chair on July, 2011 after previously serving on Gradostroitel's town accountant for a 2-year contract and was first time elected in 2011. =Current Village Board members= Board members are elected to two-year terms.

Its role is to make an independent review of all activities made by the Board and Chairman and report on any issues and problems found back to the Assembly. # # # Demographics As of the census of 2011, there were 250+ people, 134 households, and 134+ families residing in the village. Real estate Since mid-1990s nearly 50 properties sold in the Gradostroitel'. At the end of the 20th century a clean property (with infrastructure available at the border of the property) was starting at $20,000 (end of the 1990s); in the next ten years lots of properties have been sold and new cottages (ready for permanent living) have been built; there are currently 2 or 3 properties at sale with approximate price of $400,000-$500,000. Prices are historically high due to not only a small distance to the Moscow city (25 km), but to close proximity to Nikolina Gora and the well-known Rublevo-Uspenskoe highway. A renovated infrastructure, including electricity, water (available during autumn, winter & spring months in addition to summer months), and gas, as well as the woods surrounding the village made the property cost relatively high.

On Tuesday 4 September 2012, a secondary AM station broadcasting 1980s chart music, Free 80s, was launched. The four FM stations are now subsumed into the Hits Radio network whilst the single AM station is part of the Greatest Hits Radio network.

Mercia Sound (later Mercia) was launched in Coventry and Warwickshire on 23 May 1980, followed by Radio Wyvern in Herefordshire and Worcestershire on 4 October 1982. These stations were initially run independently of each other, although by the late 1980s, BRMB and Mercia were under the ownership of Midlands Radio plc, alongside AM station Xtra AM, which broadcast on both stations' former AM frequencies. The group was bought for ¬£18 million by Capital Radio plc in 1993, who sold Mercia to the GWR Group but retained BRMB. GWR went on to buy Beacon from its holding company BCCL in 1995 and Wyvern FM two years later. The four licences came under the same ownership in 2005 when GWR and Capital merged to form GCap Media. GCap was taken over in 2007 by Global but the Office of Fair Trading ruled in August 2008 that Global would need to sell off BRMB, Beacon, Mercia, Wyvern and Heart's East Midlands station due to concerns over competition interests. The stations were bought in May 2009 by a consortium led by former Chrysalis Radio chief executive Phil Riley, trading as Orion Media. Heart East Midlands continued to operate under a franchise agreement with Global until January 2011, when the station was rebranded as Gem 106 and replaced most networked output with local programming from Nottingham.

It currently is held and exhibited at the National Museum of Capodimonte in Naples, Italy. Description The circular painting is encased in a square frame and depicts a black-robed, white-bearded elderly man clasping his hands before him. A smaller barefooted man behind him uses a knife to cut the strings to the elderly man's moneypouch. The elderly man appears so lost in thought that he notices neither the theft nor the caltrops that lie in his path. A transparent sphere with a cross at its peak encloses the thief A Flemish inscription at the bottom reads: > Om dat de werelt is soe ongetru / Daer om gha ic in den ru > (\\"Because the world is perfidious, I am going into mourning\\"). Interpretation The moral suggested by the painting is that such a relinquishment of the world is not possible: one must face up to the world's difficulties, not abandon responsibility for them. The hooded misanthrope is being robbed by the small figure in the glass ball who is holding his purse. That figure is a symbol of vanity.Cf. Pietro Allegretti, Brueghel, Skira (2003), The symbolism in the painting portrays how impossible it is for his actions to lead to giving up the world. The misanthrope also is walking unaware toward caltrops set for him by the world (cast in his path). He cannot renounce the world as he would wish and he is contrasted with the shepherd in the background, who guards his sheep and who is more virtuous than the misanthrope because of his simple, honourable performance of his duties and his sense of responsibility toward his charges.R-M.

POLST began in Oregon in 1991 and currently exists in 46 states; some of the 46 states have the program in development. The POLST document is a standardized, portable, brightly colored single page medical order that documents a conversation between a provider and an individual with a serious illness or frailty towards the end of life. A POLST form allows emergency medical services to provide treatment that the individual prefers before possibly transporting he or she to an emergency facility. The POLST form is a medical order which means that the POLST form is always signed by a medical professional and, depending upon the state, the person stated on the form can sign as well. A pragmatic rule for initiating a POLST can be if the clinician would not be surprised if the individual were to die within one year. One difference between a POLST form and an advance directive is that the POLST form is designed to be actionable throughout an entire community. It is immediately recognizable and can be used by doctors and first responders (including paramedics, fire departments, police, emergency rooms, hospitals and nursing homes). Comparing to documents like DNI (Do Not Intubate), DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) and advance directive, the POLST form provides more information on the types of end-of-life treatment or intervention that the severely ill wishes to receive. Organizations that have passed formal resolutions in support of POLST include the American Bar Association and the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine (AMDA). Other organizations that support POLST include the American Nurses Association (ANA); the Institute of Medicine; National Association of Social Workers (NASW); AARP; the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM); Pew Charitable Trusts; and the Catholic Health Association of the United States (CHA). POLST orders are also known by other names in some states: Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST), Medical Orders on Scope of Treatment (MOST), Physician's Orders on Scope of Treatment (POST) or Transportable Physician Orders for Patient Preferences (TPOPP).  What is POLST?  POLST represents a significant paradigm change in advance care policy by standardizing provider communications through a plan of care in a portable way, rather than focusing solely on standardizing individuals' communications via advance directives. The POLST paradigm requires people, their surrogates, and their providers to accomplish three core tasks: *First, POLST begins with a conversation between a health care professional and the individual (or the individual's authorized surrogate) about treatment options in light of the individual's current condition. *Second, the individual's preferences for treatments are incorporated into medical orders, which are recorded on a highly visible, standardized form that is kept at the front of the medical record or with the individual if they lives in the community. :POLST forms record several treatment decisions common to seriously ill individuals, for example: cardiopulmonary resuscitation; the level of medical intervention desired in the event of an emergency (comfort only, limited treatment, or full treatment); and the use of artificial nutrition and hydration. As technology and treatment options change, POLST forms will also continue to evolve. *Third, providers encourage that the POLST form travels with the individual whenever he or she moves from one setting to another, thereby promoting the continuity of care throughout a community. :The POLST form is designed to transfer across treatment settings, so it is readily available to medical personal, including EMTs, emergency physicians and nursing staff. The POLST program relies upon teamwork and coordinated systems to ensure preferences are honored throughout the health care system. Research suggests the POLST form accurately represents individual's treatment preferences the majority of the time and that the treatments provided at the end of life match the orders on the form. An established POLST program can help reduce unwanted hospitalizations and honor the person's end-of-life wishes. To determine whether a POLST form should be completed, clinicians should ask themselves, \\"Would I be surprised if this person died in the next year?\\" If the answer is that the patient's prognosis is one year or less, then a POLST form is appropriate. In a 2006 consensus report, the National Quality Form observed that \\"compared with other advance directive programs, POLST more accurately conveys end-of-life preferences and yields higher adherence by medical professionals.\\" The National Quality Forum and other experts have recommended nationwide implementation of the POLST paradigm Implementation of POLST was also recently recommended by the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine in its report, \\"Dying in America: Improving Quality and Honoring Individual Preferences Near the End of Life.\\" The report was released September 17, 2014.  What is on the POLST Form?  The POLST form is usually on brightly colored paper that contains options for the individual depending on their health status. The POLST form generally has sections for the individual to decide whether or not they would want cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the preferred level of medical interventions, or whether they would want artificially administered nutrition. Depending on the state, there could be another section on whether to provide antibiotics or not to the individual being treated. = Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) = The first section in most forms across the country is Section A indicating the option between performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or no CPR or do not attempt to resuscitate. The national form indicates mechanical ventilators, defibrillation and cardioversion under the CPR specifications. A study showed that there was a high rate of providers respecting the individual's decisions regarding CPR, which means that the providers respected their wishes according to the POLST forms. = Preferred Medical Interventions = The level of medical intervention is on section B on the POLST form with options of \\"comfort measures\\", \\"limited additional treatment\\", or \\"full treatment\\". This section only comes into play if the individual still has a pulse and/or if they are still breathing. The \\"comfort measures\\" allow for natural death and only helps the individual relieve any pain. By checking this box, the individual also prefers to not be transferred within the hospital. The \\"limited additional treatment\\" includes the comfort measures in addition to basic medical treatment. ‚ÄúFull treatment‚Äù authorizes the medical team to try their best to save the individual and increases their life expectancy with all methods. This option also allows people to choose whether they would like a trial period. A study on nursing home residents has shown the high rate that the medical teams respected peoples‚Äô wishes and gave the treatments according to the orders on section B. = Artificially Administered Nutrition = This section comes with options of ‚Äúno artificial nutrition by tube‚Äù, ‚Äúdefined trial period of artificial nutrition by tube‚Äù and ‚Äúlong-term artificial nutrition by tube‚Äù. If the person is able to chew and swallow, the food will be taken by mouth. Studies have found that orders to withhold artificial nutrition such as feeding tubes are usually executed by the providers. = Antibiotics = For most versions of POLST, orders on antibiotics have three aspects: antibiotic use to enhance comfort, the use of intravenous/intramuscular (IV/IM) antibiotics, and the use of antibiotics at time of disease or infection. Studies have found orders on the use of antibiotics for comfort measures tend to have high rates of execution. However, one study has shown that providers do not always obey the individual's wish to not use antibiotics. Because certain types of infection have other means to alleviate symptoms of infections, so physicians' use of antibiotics seem to be generally unaffected by POLST.  How is the Form Used?  Before executing the orders on the POLST form, the provider should talk with individuals with decision-making capacity to obtain the most updated wishes. This process or conversation could involve families and relevant care providers as well to ensure people are well-informed while making the decisions. If the individual has made changes to the POLST form, the provider is responsible for explaining how the updates will likely impact future treatment plans. However, if the individual is not able to make decisions because of his or her disease state, the clinicians have to follow orders on preexisting POLST forms.  Differences between an advance directive and a POLST Form  = Advance Directive = An advance directive is a legal document that allows individuals to share their wishes with their health care team during a future medical emergency. The document does so by designating a guardian that the user wants their medical team to work with (also known as a ‚Äúsurrogate‚Äù).\\"POLST Legislative Guide\\" (PDF) 2014 Competent individuals above 18 years of age can fill out an advance directive. An advance directive allows an individual to state what treatments he or she would want in a medical crisis, but it is not a medical order. Advance directives are not portable in a sense that it is not accessible across medical systems, so it is the individual's responsibility to have the form on them at all times. This can bring up challenges as it can be difficult to locate and may need to be interpreted when it is needed. Because advanced directives are filled out by healthy individuals, the form is considered to be a \\"living will\\". = POLST Form = Unlike advance directives, a POLST should only be used when the individual is at the end of life. Typically, if a provider believes that a person's condition will increasingly worsen and make it hard for the individual to survive another year, then a POLST Form is used. A POLST form turns a person's treatment wishes outlined in an advance directive into medical orders. The POLST Form provides explicit guidance to healthcare professionals under predictable future circumstances based on the individual's current medical condition. The POLST form is reviewed more frequently compared to an advance directive to make sure that the form complies with the individual's wishes in treatments as the disease progresses. Compared to the advanced directive, there is no designated surrogate when using a POLST Form. To designate a health care surrogate, people must use an advance directive. Once a surrogate is established and if the individual does not have the mental capacity to make decisions, the surrogate has the authority to make decisions on the POLST Form; the amount of authority for the surrogate, however, varies per state. An individual does not need to have an advance directive to have a POLST form although health care professionals recommend that all competent adults have advance directives in place; this will help healthcare providers shape a more concise medical decision that better reflects the individual's wishes. Lastly, the POLST form is very portable unlike the advance directive. It is the physicians' responsibility to make it accessible across different medical facilities.  POLST History  :*1991: Oregon POLST task force was created. The first prototype was known as the Medical Treatment Cover Sheet (MTC). This was created to have a standard to regulate medical orders for people with chronic illnesses. The list of treatments that were included on this form would include resuscitation, nutrition, intubation, antibiotics, and other preferred medical interventions. Focus groups and studies were executed to evaluate the use of this form and significant modifications were made. This later resulted in the renaming of the form. :*1993: The name \\"Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment or POLST was adopted. :*1995: First POLST form was used in Oregon. Many other states wanted to implement this in their own settings so there was a need for execution at a national level. :*2004: :**National POLST Paradigm Task Forced was developed. The task force included Oregon, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. The focus of the task force was to create an organized standard and help other states who wanted to develop a POLST program. :**Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Nevada, Utah, and Vermont were all under development for POLST by this time. :*2005: The National Task Force created a more clear description and outline of the program including the contents of the form and developments of endorsement for the program. This was established as the National POLST Paradigm. :*2006: West Virginia and Wisconsin adopt POLST. Iowa forms a focus group of health care providers to address the current fragmentation of end-of- life communication. :*2007: A formal in-person meeting was held for education on the POLST paradigm at the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization conference in New Orleans. :*2008: POLST becomes law in California and MOLST becomes law in New York. Iowa pilot project conducted (continues until 2011). :*2009: :**A second in-person formal meeting was held with the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine national conference in Austin, Texas. A major goal at this point was to have a structure similar in all states so it can be used and honored in all states and provide education about the program for efficient care. The program gives people the power to make the decision about their care and provides a guidance for decision-making about life-sustaining treatments. :**Massachusetts MOLST Demonstration Project was implemented in Massachusetts pursuant to a mandate in the Commonwealth Acts of 2008. MA MOLST form http://molst-ma.org/sites/molst- ma.org/files/MOLST%20Form%20and%20Instructions%208.10.13%20FINAL.pdf :**Oregon developed a was to allow electronic access of POLST statewide to steer away from paper forms and accessing medical records. :*2010: Illinois forms the POLST Taskforce with support from more than 60 health care organizations; the Catholic Health Association formally supports POLST. :*2011: POLST is signed into law in New Jersey after Governor Chris Christie conditionally vetoes S-2197 for provisions allowing doctors to override people's wishes. Vermont requires all out-of-hospital DNR/COLST orders to be documented on the Vermont DNR/COLST form. :*2012: :**First National POLST Conference held in San Diego, California. Iowa passes legislation to implement the current IPOST form; Illinois passes POLST legislation (Illinois introduces a POLST form in March 2013). :**Wisconsin Catholic bishops warn against POLST. :**Pro-Life groups react to Wisconsin bishops' statement. :**Pro-life leaders find parallels between POLST ramifications and similar political expedients in history. :**The Catholic Health Association specifies how the POLST form is consistent with the Catholic Directives. :* 2013: POLST becomes law in Indiana and Nevada; 20 states have POLST statutes. 27 states was under development for this program. Only 7 states at this point did not have POLST in some form of development. :* 2015: :** California allows a nurse practitioner or physician assistant under a supervision of a physician to sign a POLST form. :** 46 out of 50 states have the program established or under development.  Public Opinions  = Support = Supporters suggests that POLST protects individuals‚Äô right to make their own medical decisions and prevents the miscommunications among individuals, their family members and healthcare providers. Most healthcare providers have a positive attitude towards POLST, saying that the form presents peoples‚Äô wishes and they can provide better care at individual's end of life with the form as guidance. This also prevents undesirable interventions as well as unnecessary expense on hospice care in healthcare facilities. For example, the medical teams would not give resuscitation or other medical interventions unless individuals indicate on the form. According to Gundersen lutheran Health System, after they have adopted POLST, about $3000 to $6000 is reduced at the cost for each person because the hospital does not need to use medical devices or interventions to support their lives after they select ‚Äúcomfort measures‚Äù on the form. In addition, the formal document is a standard medical order signed by physicians and it is legal and effective in various healthcare settings and states. In other words, if individuals travel to another state with POLST, hospitals in that state may accept the form as a plan of care and fulfill their wishes at the end of life. POLST can be also an implement to examine any discrepancies between the actual treatments and individuals‚Äô preferences, and to make sure that healthcare providers would respect and obey their preferences, which avoids the situations that may go against their wills. POLST covers the limitations that advance directives and Do Not Resuscitate or Do Not Intubate orders (DNR/DNI) have. For example, illnesses are unsteady as the conditions may change in severity every day. Individuals that are 18 years old and above can fill out the form when they are healthy and competent, but they are not able to foresee what may happen and they may change their mind in treatments; however, advance directives does not take the changes into consideration. The form can be filled out by surrogates who may express individual‚Äôs preferences differently or mistakenly. Also, DNR/DNI only considers the situations that are related to CPR or intubation instead of recording individuals‚Äô preferences in various situations at the end of their lives. Some studies have shown that the providers were less likely to give aggressive treatments to individuals with DNR/DNI even if they are not critically ill. A study on nursing home residents has found that most residents with DNR order marked on POLST forms that they would like to have treatments, which indicates that DNR orders do not convey individual‚Äôs ideas and POLST is a better tool in communication. Therefore, advance directives and DNR/DNI may not be truly proposed to improve individuals care at the end of life. = Opposition = Conservative groups like the Media Research Center and the Catholic Medical Association argue that there will be unintended consequences or potential abuses fostered by POLST adoption. In some cases, this results from the way the enabling laws are written. Any document determining an individual's quality of care or life- ending choices carries moral and ethical dilemmas, and POLST instruments (or the protocols and circumstances through which they are explained to people) have been criticized for this by the Catholic Medical Association. The Catholic Health Association answered criticisms in a white paper entitled ‚ÄúThe POLST Paradigm and Form: Facts and Analysis.‚Äù POLST is viewed to be conflicted with Catholic ideas on ‚Äúrightful and wrongful refusal decisions‚Äù especially on the last section about nutrition and antibiotics, and the Catholic providers feel being forced to follow the order since it seems to violate their beliefs. Healthcare providers also mention some challenges that have met when introducing POLST to individual's and their families. They may not feel comfortable discussing the content of the form or they have trouble understanding it. People and their family members may also have different opinions when completing the form. In addition, the physicians may not support POLST and refuse to sign because they are worried that they may need to take the blame or have some responsibilities by signing it even if using the form is a part of standard care. Some people suggested that some of the questions on POLST forms do not apply to actual situations. For example, in the first section on the form is asking if individuals would like to have resuscitation when they do not have pulses. But some individuals may not be hospitalized or they may be living at home and cannot get access to the interventions mentioned on the form; and thus, the question is not suitable for their situations. Some people also doubt whether POLST truly delivers individuals‚Äô wills as they may change their minds in different contexts. Studies have shown that up to 45% of individuals were unsure of their choices when they first filled out the form and up to 70% of individuals had inconsistent answers when the questions were phrased differently.  POLST research  Several studies have supported the use of POLST as a tool to ensure people's wishes are complied with: :* In a 1998 study, charts of 180 residents at eight Oregon nursing facilities were evaluated over a one-year period. Where the POLST forms of residents included \\"do not resuscitate\\" and \\"comfort measures only\\" orders, none of the residents received unwanted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), intensive care, or ventilator support. :* In 2000, a study was done in the community setting showed that CPR use was 91% consistent with the use of POLST forms and about 45% of medical interventions were consistent with section B of the form. :* In 2004, a survey of selected sites revealed that the POLST program was widely used in Oregon nursing facilities. Care matched POLST instructions to a high degree regarding CPR (91%), antibiotics (86%), intravenous fluids (84%), and feeding tubes (94%). Level-of-care instructions (from comfort care to full medical intervention) were followed less often (46%). :* A 2004 survey of 572 EMTs in Oregon found that a large majority of EMTs felt that the POLST form provides clear instructions about people's preferences and is useful when deciding which treatments to provide. :* In 2009, researchers assessed the penetration of POLST in hospice programs in Oregon, Wisconsin, and West Virginia. A pilot study indicated that POLST was used widely in hospices in Oregon (100%) and West Virginia (85%) but only regionally in Wisconsin (6%). A majority of hospice staff believed POLST was useful in preventing unwanted resuscitation and initiating conversations about treatment preferences. :* In 2010, an observational retrospective cohort study compared the use of the POLST forms with the use of \\"traditional\\" orders in 1711 residents of nursing facility. The results of the study showed that individuals are much more likely to include end-of-life treatment preferences \\"beyond CPR status\\" when using the POLST form (98%) than \\"traditional practices or orders\\" (16%). :* In 2011, a survey with a sample size of 169 was done in the state of New York found that the about half of the providers and healthcare workers including physicians, nurses, social workers and nurse practitioners felt the need to have a conversation about the POLST form with the individual they are providing service to. The major reason for this preference is these healthcare workers believe the use of the POLST form can lead to better management of disease symptoms such as pain. :*In 2014, state death records containing cause and location of death were matched with POLST orders for people (sample size N = 58,000) with a POLST form in the state registry. Conclusion: The association with numbers of deaths in the hospital suggests that end-of-life preferences of people who wish to avoid hospitalization as documented in POLST orders are honored. :*In 2014, a chart review study with a sample size of 31,294 studied POLST forms in an electronic registry in the state of Oregon. The study found that POLST forms came in six different combinations: \\"DNR/Comfort Measures Only, DNR/Limited Interventions, DNR/Full Treatment, Attempt CPR/Comfort Measures Only, Attempt CPR/Limited Interventions, and Attempt CPR/Full Treatment.\\" The data showed that about 10% of the order combinations appeared confusing and did not make sense to providers because they seemed contradicting. The most popular combinations were \\"DNR/Comfort Measures and DNR/Limited Interventions.\\" :*In 2016, the study included comparison of two different state POLST programs having distinct demographics and different approaches to electronic registries. A key metric evaluated was the relationship of POLST medical intervention orders to in-hospital death, which was evaluated using POLST data linked with state death records. Conclusion: the study indicated similar patterns between the two states in which Comfort Only orders less often resulted in in-hospital deaths, compared to Full Treatment orders. = Limitations of POLST Research = Most of the studies done on the POLST research were done in Oregon where there is a less diverse demographic. The studies done on POLST were mainly done in nursing facilities. Therefore, there is limited data about POLST in other parts of the community. In addition, the training for the physicians for implementing POLST program may not be consistent throughout different healthcare facilities.

As the patriarch Joseph () had been deposed, Ezekiel () had been selected to replace him, much to the joy of the king Khusrow Anushirwan who loved him and held him in high esteem.Chronicle of Seert, ii. 100‚Äì101 A mighty plague devastated Mesopotamia with the Sassanian authorities unable to curb its spread and the dead littered the streets, in particular the imperial capital Seleucia-Ctesiphon () The metropolitans of Adiabene ( \\"·∏§dƒÅya·∏á\\", encompassing Arbil, Nineveh, Hakkari and Adhorbayjan) and Beth Garmai ( \\"Bƒì·πØ Garmai\\", encompassing Kirkuk and the surrounding region) called for services of prayer, fasting and penitence to be held in all the churches under their jurisdiction, as was believed to have been done by the Ninevites following the preaching of the prophet Jonah. Following its success, the tradition has been strictly adhered to every year by the members of the Church of the East. Patriarchs of the Church of the East and Chaldean Catholic Church also called for extra fasts in an effort to alleviate the suffering and affliction of those persecuted by ISIS in the region of Nineveh and the rest of the Middle East.

Main features =Cell-level security= Apache Accumulo extends the Bigtable data model, adding a new element to the key called Column Visibility. This element stores a logical combination of security labels that must be satisfied at query time in order for the key and value to be returned as part of a user request. This allows data of varying security requirements to be stored in the same table, and allows users to see only those keys and values for which they are authorized. =Server-side programming= In addition to Cell-Level Security, Apache Accumulo provides a server-side programming mechanism called Iterators that allows users to perform additional processing at the Tablet Server. The range of operations that can be applied is equivalent to those that can be implemented within a MapReduce Combiner function, which produces an aggregate value for several key-value pairs. =User key ordering= Apache Accumulo orders entries in order of user keys, and exposes an iterator over a key range. This allows locality of reference not available from some other distributed stores (including Cassandra and Voldemort that order by hash of the user key).

It won the 15 m span class at the World Gliding Championships of 1978 but its advances over the best, more conventional, opposition were not sufficient to lead to widespread imitation. Design and development The Akaflieg Braunschweig or Akademische Fliegergruppe Braunschweig () is one of some fourteen German student flying groups attached to and supported by their home Technical University. Several have designed and built aircraft, often technically advanced and leading the development of gliders in particular. The announcement, in 1975, of a new, unrestricted 15 m glider class led the Brunswick group to the design of the SB-11, a variable geometry aircraft. A long-standing challenge for the designers of competition sailplanes were the conflicting requirements posed by the need to gain in height in sometimes weak and narrow thermals, calling for high lift and low stalling speeds for small radius turns, and the need for rapid penetration of the cool, sinking air between thermals. In thermals, wings should ideally be of high camber and be lightly loaded; between them, low camber wings with high wing loading would fly faster. Large area, camber changing flaps were one solution but vortexes generated at their extremities added significantly to the drag, decreasing climb rates. Akaflieg Brunswick decided to follow the example of the disappointing British Sigma by providing the SB-11 with Wortmann flaps along the whole of the trailing edge of the wing, including the ailerons. This avoided the flap associated vortexes, though any increase in wing area, however implemented, will lower the aspect ratio and raise the induced drag caused by wingtip vortexes. The SB-11 is almost entirely built of weight saving CRP. In order to concentrate design effort on the wing, the Brunswick students blended together the front fuselage of the Schleicher ASW 20 with the rear fuselage and empennage of the Schempp-Hirth Janus. This gave the SB-11 a conventional fuselage, deeper forward of the shoulder wing, with a long, single piece, forward hinged canopy and a monowheel undercarriage under the wing. There is provision for water ballast. The rear fuselage is slender, with a T-tail with straight edged fin, rudder and swept, all moving tailplane. The wings of the SB-11 have 2.3¬∞ of dihedral and are unswept. The inner 60% of span has constant chord. The outer panels, carrying the ailerons, are straight tapered with a taper ratio of 0.4. Manually driven full span Fowler type Wortmann flaps emerge from the trailing edge between rollers, increasing the chord by 200 mm (7.9 in) over the untapered inner wing and by 80 mm (3.2 in) at the tip. Overall the flaps produce a 25% increase in wing area. Their trailing edges carry ailerons outboard and plain camber changing flaps inboard. Above wing, mid-chord Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are placed at about mid span. Operational history The SB-11 first flew in 1978. The flaps worked well, with low operating loads and deploying \\"at the flick of a lever\\". It was entered into the 16th World Gliding Championships held at Chateauroux in France in July 1978, piloted by Helmut Reichmann. He won the 15 m class, followed by an ASW-20 not far behind. The SB-11 provided a useful test of the advantages of variable geometry gliders. Thoroughly examined at the Competition and in later tests, it outperformed the other 15 m class gliders of its day in the climb but, crucially, not by much. Its stalling speeds and turn radius was smaller than that of the ASW 20, good for weak thermals, but was perhaps rather poorer than the ASW in the fast glide. Whilst Reichmann was pleased with the SB-11 at the meeting, saying it was the best aircraft there, he later noted that cross-country pilots had plenty to do already and that finding strong lift was more important than exploiting weak thermals. Experience with the SB-11 and with later variable geometry gliders from the Akafliegs of Munich, Darmstadt and Stuttgart (the M√º27, D-40 and FS-29 respectively) showed that, whilst there were performance gains, these were not enough to compensate for the extra expense, complexity and pilot workload that accompanied them; variable geometry did not, in the end, prove a useful way forward.

An innovative appeal was to health consciousness; the ads directed at the middle-class promised that \\"smoke not only checks disease but preserves the lungs.\\" A rugged heavy taste was pitched to working men, soldiers and sailors, while \\"delicately fragrant\\" was part of the appeal to the upper-class. The packaging was attractive, posters were omnipresent to show that smoking was a normal part of English life; lobbying was used to undercut the anti-tobacco lobby.A. V.

He previously played for the Detroit Tigers and Milwaukee Brewers. P√©rez was signed by the Tigers as a non-drafted free agent on July 2, 2007, and has seen time at every position on the field except for catcher. Early life P√©rez, was born in San Francisco de As√≠s, Aragua, Venezuela on March 26, 1991. Professional career =Minor Leagues= After P√©rez was signed by the Tigers, he was placed with the VSL Tigers of the Venezuelan Summer League In 2009, P√©rez was promoted to the GCL Tigers of the Gulf Coast League. He was soon promoted to the West Michigan Whitecaps of the Midwest League. Later that season, he was promoted to the Class A-Advanced Lakeland Flying Tigers of the Florida State League. At the start of 2010, P√©rez found himself back with the West Michigan Whitecaps for which he had spent the 2011 season. He was named a Mid-Season and Post-Season All-Star. =Detroit Tigers= P√©rez was called up to the Major Leagues by Detroit on June 9, 2012 after Jhonny Peralta went on paternity leave. P√©rez made his debut that day, and got his first hit a day later. He was subsequently sent back to Lakeland so Peralta could rejoin the Tigers. P√©rez started the 2013 season with the Double-A Erie SeaWolves. P√©rez was recalled to the Tigers on July 9, 2013, replacing Omar Infante who was placed on the disabled list. P√©rez was sent back to Double-A's Erie, on August 2, 2013, to make room for the newly acquired Jos√© Iglesias. However, P√©rez was recalled to the Tigers just three days later, after teammate Jhonny Peralta received a 50-game suspension due to his ties to the Biogenesis scandal. In 33 plate appearances for the Detroit Tigers during the 2015 season, P√©rez was batting only .061 with just two hits, one walk, and no RBIs. =Milwaukee Brewers= On June 2, 2015, P√©rez was claimed off waivers by the Milwaukee Brewers and activated the same day.

It is not recognised by the Russian federal nor local Murmansk Oblast governments. Establishment On 14 December 2008 the 1st Congress of the Russian S√°mi was held with the participation of the Kola S√°mi Association and the Association of S√°mi in Murmansk Oblast to establish a framework for creation of a Russian S√°mi Parliament. A suggestion to have the Russian Federation pick representatives to the new assembly was voted down by a clear majority. The Congress also chose a Council of Representatives tasked with working to establish a parliament and to otherwise represent Russian S√°mi. Two years later, the 2nd Congress of the Russian S√°mi convened in Murmansk on 12 December 12 2010, to elect members to the new Kola S√°mi Assembly. The aims of the assembly are to represent the S√°mi people and to work towards a recognised Russian S√°mi Parliament. According to one commentator, however, \\"in the ... Assembly, the Kola S√°mi have achieved their most unifying and representative structure to date;\\" the extent to which the Murmansk regional authorities are prepared to work with this body remains unclear. During preparation for the planned 3rd Congress of the Russian S√°mi in 2014, Russian authorities worked to establish a new gathering, the Congress of the Indigenous People of the Northern Kola ‚Äì S√°mi, with the goal of sideling the Kola S√°mi Assembly in favor of a new organization more aligned with local governmental officials. Predecessor In 1866, as part the reforms of Tsar Alexander II, the Kola peninsula was organized as a volost connected to Arkhangelsk uyezd. Two years later, on O.S. (N.S. 6 February 1868), the Kola Sobbar (–ö√≥–ª–∞–¥–∞–≥ —Å√≥–±–±–∞—Ä—å) was established as the first elected body to represent Russian S√°mi. Although there is no direct lineage between the Kola Sobbar and the Kola S√°mi Assembly, it is cited as an example of a prior Russian S√°mi elected assembly. By coincidence, the Kola Sobbar met on the same day as what would later be declared the annual S√°mi National Day across S√°pmi. Links with S√°mi parliaments in other countries Full participation for the Kola S√°mi Assembly in the Saami Council depends upon S√°mi parliaments in the other Nordic countries accepting the Kola S√°mi Assembly as a \\"Russian S√°mi Parliament\\". Since Russia does not recognize the assembly, the Kola S√°mi Association and Association of S√°mi in Murmansk Oblast are both seated as members of the Saami Council and have representation on the S√°mi Parliamentary Council. Initially, the Russian S√°mi were granted observer status in 2000, but three years later they were allowed to be participating observers. In 2012, members of the Kola S√°mi Assembly and other Russian S√°mi associations visited the S√°mi Parliament of Norway in K√°r√°≈°johka to learn more about its structure and operations as part of a competency building tour.

Pagefast Ltd, Lancaster OK, 2003. ISSN 1368-485X Design and development The Atos was originally designed as a competition rigid wing hang glider in 1998, with production commencing the following year. Since then the design has undergone almost continuous refinement and a succession of model numbers. It remained in production in 2012. The aircraft structure is made from carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer. The wing uses minimal cable bracing and incorporates both flaps and spoilers for roll control. The aspect ratio for most models is in the range of 11:1 or 12:1. Achieved glide ratios run as high as 20:1. Later models incorporate a horizontal tailplane for improved stability. The Atos gliders are designed for folding for ground transportation. The largest model, the Atos VX, for example, can be folded into 5.80 x 0.48 x 0.20m (19.0 x 1.57 x 0.66 feet) in 18 minutes and weighs . Later model Atos are compatible with the Swedish Aerosport Mosquito power pack. The wing was also later developed into an ultralight trike, the Ultralight Design Atos Trike. It can also be fitted to the Veleria Dedalo Strike-T trike.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 244. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015.

Based at the Aden Adde International Airport in the capital Mogadishu, it is under the aegis of the federal Ministry of Air and Land Transport. In 2012, the ministry along with the Somali Civil Aviation Steering Committee set a three-year window for reconstruction of the national civil aviation capacity. After a long period of management by the Civil Aviation Caretaker Authority for Somalia (CACAS), SCAMA in conjunction with the International Civil Aviation Organization also finalized a process in 2014 to transfer control of Somalia airspace to the new Air Space Management Centre in the capital. History =CACAS= Prior to collapse of the central government with the outbreak of the civil war in 1991, the Somali Civil Aviation Authority oversaw Somalia's airspace. The UN's Civil Aviation Caretaker Authority for Somalia (CACAS) since then collected over-flight revenues on behalf of the country, reinvesting the proceeds into air traffic control and airport maintenance. =Transitional period= In 2002, the newly formed Transitional National Government (TNG) briefly reassumed control of Somalia's airspace with the re-establishment of the Somali Civil Aviation Authority by the Ministry of Air and Land Transport. With the creation of the TNG's successor the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004, the reconstituted central government of Somalia resumed formal preparations in 2011 to transfer supervision of the country's airspace from the Nairobi-based CACAS to its aviation ministry. After reassuming control of the Somali capital Mogadishu in mid-2011, the TFG also on a contractual basis delegated airport maintenance and operation duties at the Aden Adde International Airport to the Dubai-based SKA Air and Logistics, a private firm specializing in conflict zones. In April 2012, former Somali Airlines pilots, Abikar Nur and Ahmed Elmi Gure, met with aviation officials at the Lufthansa Flight Training Center in Phoenix, United States, to discuss the possibility of resuming the historic working relationship between Somali Airlines and Lufthansa. The meeting ended with a pledge by the school's chairman, Captain Matthias Kippenberg, to assist the Somali aviation authorities in training prospective pilots. In July 2012, Mohammed Osman Ali (Dhagah-tur), the General Director of the Ministry of Aviation and Transport, announced that the Somali government had begun preparations to revive the national carrier, Somali Airlines. The Somali authorities along with the Somali Civil Aviation Steering Committee (SCASC) -- a joint commission composed of officials from Somalia's federal and regional governments as well as members of the CACAS, ICAO/TCB and UNDP‚Äîconvened with international aviation groups in Montreal to request support for the ongoing rehabilitation efforts. The SCASC set a three-year window for reconstruction of the national civil aviation capacity. It also requested the complete transfer of Somali civil aviation operations and assets from the CACAS caretaker body to the Somali authorities. Control of airspace After meeting with CACAS representatives, Abdullahi Elmoge Hersi, Somalia's then Minister of Information, Posts and Telecommunications, announced in May 2013 that the Somali federal government would reassume control of the country's airspace by December 31. In preparation for the transition, staff within Somalia were receiving training, with over 100 airspace personnel scheduled to be transferred to Mogadishu for management duties. In June 2014, Minister of Air Transportation and Civil Aviation Said Jama Qorshel announced that the decision to transfer management of Somalia's air space to the federal government had been finalized, following a meeting between himself and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) representatives in Montreal. He indicated that the officials had agreed to relocate all of the necessary equipment to the new Air Space Management Centre in Mogadishu, technology that ICAO had previously operated on the Somali Civil Aviation Authority's behalf. Additionally, Qorshel stated that the planning stage of the transfer process would soon conclude, and trained Somali technicians would thereafter assume their aviation duties in the capital. He also said that modern aviation equipment had already been imported from Italy, and that additional up-to-date technology earmarked for the Aden Adde International Airport in Mogadishu would be delivered. On 17 December 2014, Transport Minister Qorshel announced that the Somali government had regained control of its airspace after reaching an agreement with the International Civil Aviation Organization. The minister also indicated that Somalia's airspace would be managed from the capital Mogadishu, and additional professionals would be trained for the purpose.

It is among the most famous works of Islamic calligraphy, and has been called \\"one of the most extraordinary luxury manuscripts ever created.\\" Art historian Yasser Tabbaa wrote that the \\"evanescent effect\\" of the gold lettering on indigo \\"appears to affirm the Mu'tazili belief in the created and mysterious nature of the Word of God.\\" History The codex has also been dated as late as 1020 CE and placed in C√≥rdoba as well as Qairawan. According to some researchers, the Blue Qur'an is also one of the only extant Fatimid Qur'ans. However, at the moment, the comparison with the Latin Bible of Danila, preserved at Cava de' Tirreni (Italy) but produced in Spain, offers a number of material connections (the deep blue parchment, the ruling, and the use of gold ink) rather suggesting a Spanish origin. Even older Quranic manuscripts are the Sana'a manuscript, Samarkand Kufic Quran, and Topkapi manuscript. It is written in gold and decorated in silver (that has since oxidized) on vellum colored with indigo, a unique aspect of a Quranic manuscript, probably emulating the purple parchment used for Byzantine Imperial manuscripts. Red ink is also used. A Maghribi script Qur'an manuscript written in gold on blue paper has been dated to the 13th or 14th century, inviting comparison to the Blue Qur'an. The Maghribi manuscript's parchment is a lighter tone than the Blue Qur'an and is more heavily decorated, having a foliage motif throughout. Folio from the \\"Blue\\" Qur'an, 9th-10th century. Ink, opaque watercolor, silver (now oxidized) and gold on blue-dyed parchment, 11 3/16 x 15 in. (28.4 x 38.1 cm). Brooklyn Museum, 1995.51a-b The manuscript's approximately 600 pages were dispersed during the Ottoman period; today most of it is located in the National Institute of Art and Archaeology Bardo National Museum in Tunis, with detached folios in museums worldwide. These institutions include the Mus√©e de la Civilisation et des Arts Islamiques in Raqqada, which has 67 folios. The folios are differently sized: the folio held by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is 28.25 cm by 37.46 cm, but there are pages as large as 31 cm by 41 cm. Most of the folios remained in Qairawan until the 1950s, when they were further dispersed. In 2012 and 2013, folios from the Blue Qur'an were sold in major Islamic art auctions, carrying a price of hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece. Christie's of London sold folios in 2012. Sotheby's auctioned off one folio in 2010 for a reported ¬£529,250, a record-breaking sum and over double the low estimate for the lot. Form Each sura's verses are demarcated in groups of 20 with silver rosettes and the text itself is inked in gold; the precious metallic text and rich indigo might have been a way for the Fatimid dynasty, which controlled North Africa at the time, to display its wealth, power, and religion in the face of the Byzantine Empire, which controlled Anatolia, and used gold or silver ink on purple parchment for its most lavish manuscripts. The gold ink was created by grinding gold and suspending it in a solution. The surrounding decoration of the mihrab of the Great Mosque of Cordoba is similar to and might have been the model for the Blue Qur'an's design. Contemporaneous manuscripts were often written on dyed parchment, particularly saffron-colored parchment, a holdover from the pre- Islamic time. Though the method by which the Blue Qur'an was dyed remains unknown, Ibn Badis related the two contemporaneous methods of dying: dip-dying after the parchment was smoothed, or adding dye during the parchment production process. Given the brilliance of the color, it is likely that the parchment was dip-dyed before it was cured, impregnating it with the pigment. The Kufic script has sharp angles and is written in groups of 15 lines per page with no vowel markings, common characteristics in 9th- and 10th-century Islamic manuscripts. The comparatively large number of lines on each page deviates from the norm of other contemporaneous Qur'ans, such as the Amajur Qur'an, that dictated three lines per horizontal page. A column of letters is perceptible on the right side of each folio, created by the insertion of spaces called caesurae that put single letters at the beginnings of lines. Words with unconnected letters are occasionally split between lines in the manuscript, another common feature of Qur'ans from this period. The spacing of the letters has been described as \\"almost musical\\" and as \\"visual rhythm\\" by Robert Hillenbrand. Another unusual feature of this manuscript is visible mastara lines on some pages, used by the calligrapher to place the text.

He has been a member of the New York Bar since 1984. In 1985, he was admitted to the Bar in Hamburg, Germany, where he founded the law firm Prinz Neidhardt Engelschall. Prinz started a series of litigations against different European media that produced a collection of precedents at the highest German and European Courts over the next 20 years. The cases are known as the Princess-Caroline-decisions in German and European jurisprudence.http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Press/Multimedia/Webcasts+of+public+hearings/webcastEN_media?id=20101013-1‚ü®=en&flow;=high Prinz also represented leading German athletes, such as Boris Becker, and especially German soccer clubs of the premier league, their coaches and players, as well as the T-mobile biking team and the German national showjumping team.

In 2003, Prinz began to represent the Swedish Royal Family against invasion of privacy and defamatory articles in German media. Prinz used preliminary Court orders to force 23 German magazines to print replies, retractions and apologies on their front pages. Claims for damages and injunctions followed, which led to the decision of the Hamburg Court of Appeals to award ‚Ç¨400,000,00 (USD 538.180,00) damages to Princess Madeleine of Sweden. An appeal of the media company to the Federal Appellate Court was rejected in 2010.

Named for the Samar Island in the Philippines, it was the second U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Construction and final days of World War II Samar was laid down on 21 September 1944 by Bethlehem-Fairfield, Sparrow's Point, MD, under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 2683); launched on 19 October 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Elsie M. Alexander, delivered to the Navy on 31 October 1944, converted to an internal combustion engine repair ship (ARG) by the Bethlehem Steel Co., Key Highway Plant, Baltimore, MD and commissioned on 5 June 1945, Comdr. Andrew M. Harvey in command. Following shakedown, Samar sailed for the Panama Canal Zone, arriving at Coco Solo on 28 July. She transited the canal on the 29th and, while en route to Hawaii, received word of the Surrender of Japan. At Pearl Harbor on 16 August, the crew serviced ship for four days while awaiting orders. Underway 21 August, the repair ship sailed to Okinawa via Eniwetok and Saipan, arriving in Hagushi Bay on 22 September. Reporting for duty to Commander Service Division 101 and Task Unit (TU) 70.2.3, she proceeded to China six days later, stood up the Yangtze River on the 28th and moored to buoys in the Hwangpu River off Shanghai on 1 October. Within hours of her arrival, she had six small craft alongside for engine repairs. Samar remained at Shanghai for five months, racing against time as demobilization of sailors stripped her crew of trained repair technicians. At one point, 26 ships and boats were simultaneously assigned to Samar for repairs. Fate Assigned to Task Unit 70.2.2 (the North China Service Unit), Samar continued the grinding work of repair services on the China station until 5 May, when the repair ship got underway to return to the United States. Arriving at San Pedro on 27 May Samar later shifted to San Diego and decommissioned there on 24 July 1947. Berthed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet, she remained there until struck from the Navy list and officially transferred to the Maritime Administration's National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, CA, on 1 September 1962. Samar remained laid up in the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet until her sale and delivery to Zidell Explorations Corporation for scrapping on 25 January 1974.

Along with Edson F. Cady, he was a founder of Snohomish, which would become the county seat from 1862 until 1896. Over his life, Ferguson served as county commissioner, postmaster, a Washington state legislator, Speaker of the State House of Representatives, Snohomish City Council President, justice of the peace, and mayor of Snohomish, as well as realtor, saloon keeper, and store owner. He was involved in many early plans to make Snohomish prominent, including a ferry for military use across the Snohomish River and a trail through the Cascade Mountains to reach a gold rush, few of which were successful. Upon his death, Ferguson was eulogized as the \\"Father of Snohomish.\\"  Early life  Ferguson was born in Westchester County, New York on March 5, 1833. He was the fourth child of Samuel and Maria Ferguson. His father was a farmer and former paper maker of Scottish descent. The Ferguson family were among the first families to settle the region between the Connecticut border and the Hudson River. At age 16, Emory served an apprenticeship with a carpenter. In five years he completed his apprenticeship and began work as a journeyman. However, just one month after his 21st birthday, he left for California to join the California Gold Rush.  Searches for gold  Ferguson elected to travel to San Francisco via the Isthmus of Panama, a quick but harrowing route. He arrived on May 4, 1854, and initially searched for gold along with the majority of participants in the gold rush. However, by 1856 Ferguson was operating a general store located near the original Sutter strike. He soon left the business behind to run a sawmill located in Greenwood Valley, El Dorado County. He would soon leave this endeavor as well, leaving in 1858 for the Fraser River during the Fraser River gold rush. He took a steamer north to Puget Sound, followed by a stop in Whatcom to prepare for the final portion of his journey to British Columbia, departing Whatcom on July 12, 1858. This trip was ultimately fruitless, and Ferguson headed south to Seattle and then Steilacoom in search of employment.  Washington  In Steilacoom, Ferguson found employment in carpentry. While in Steilacoom, Ferguson along with Edson Cady, Egbert H. Tucker, and Hiel Barnes decided to head north and settle land around the Snohomish River with the goal of establishing a ferry and road for future military use. In March 1860 Ferguson arrived at Cadyville, the town having been established by and named after Edson Cady. He brought with him a home he built in Steilacoom and shipped north as well as goods to start a store. Ferguson made a homestead claim of 160 acres of land along the river. During a short-lived gold rush in Okanogan County, Ferguson sold subscriptions to establish a trail from Cadyville to the site. Construction started in May 1860, but the rush did last and the trail was abandoned after. Ferguson returned to the Snohomish. Ferguson's cottage, ca. 1902. Ferguson is seen seated, second from the left. In late 1860, Ferguson was instrumental in the creation of Snohomish County. The region was under the control of Island County, whose county seat lay on Whidbey Island. Communication with the county seat was difficult due to limited infrastructure in the region, and after a settler by the name of T. P. Carter was killed by local natives desire for closer governance ran high. A vote was taken. Seventeen ballots were cast, Ferguson's among them. The ballots were forwarded to the Island County seat of Coupeville. There is no record that these votes were ever received or counted, and ultimately nothing was done. Following the unsuccessful vote, a group of twenty citizens rallied under the leadership of Ferguson. Efforts were made to organize a petition to send to Olympia, but before it could even be assembled the territorial legislature moved to grant Snohomish County its independence. An act was passed on January 14, 1861 creating Snohomish County from Island County. The act also named Ferguson as one of three county commissioners. Ferguson personally stored county records in his small home. During the first meeting of county commissioners, on which Ferguson sat as chairman, Ferguson was named justice for the Snohomish precinct. A post office was soon established with Ferguson taking on the responsibility of being postmaster. His salary as postmaster, as well as the expense of carrying mail to its destination came out of the income of the office. He handled approximately three letters a month, so to save money Ferguson arranged a deal with the post office in Mukilteo. Whoever happened to be heading up the Snohomish River would bring Ferguson mail, and whoever happened to be heading downstream would deliver mail to the Mukilteo office and on to its destination. Because of this frugal if not timely practice, Ferguson achieved a surplus of 27 cents at the end of the quarter and remitted it to Washington, D.C. Thereafter the government decided to cover the expense of moving mail from Mukileo and Snohomish. In 1864 Ferguson opened the Blue Eagle saloon after being licensed to operate the establishment. Having little time to actively wait as bartender, so he simply put change in the register and prominently displayed the price list for drinks. Ferguson would later claim to have never lost a dime operating this way. In February 1871, he had completed the requirements of his homestead and filed to officially form Snohomish the following June. Over the next two decades, Ferguson would take on further responsibilities in addition to being postmaster, including state legislator, Speaker of the State House of Representatives, and Snohomish City Council President as well as mayor of Snohomish. His late years were devoted to private business. Ferguson died on October 7, 1911, and is buried in the Grand Army of the Republic Cemetery in Snohomish, Washington. Personal life Before meeting his future wife, Ferguson lived with an Indian woman who gave birth to a girl. While serving on the state legislature in Olympia, Washington, Ferguson met Lucretia Morgan. In 1868 they married. Following the marriage, Ferguson transferred the ownership of the Blue Eagle Saloon to his brother and assumed the life of a family man. With Lucretia, Ferguson would have four children named Ivie, Ethel, Sylvia, and Emory Cecil.

During Operation Enduring freedom, FOB Shank was one of the most heavily rocketed forward operating bases by the Taliban in Afghanistan. In 2014, the base was turned over to Afghan National Army, who established Camp Maiwand at the northern end of the FOB. American forces later returned and built a new installation, Camp Dahlke, near the southern portion of the FOB. History In 2008, International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) used the base to train the Afghan National Police (ANP). The Police Academy, led by a U.S. Police Mentoring Training team, cooperated daily with the Czech Provincial Reconstruction Team Logar, composed of 200 Czech Soldiers and about 10 civilians. These efforts were focused on training the Afghanistan National Auxiliary Police to become members of the ANP. As of 8 July 2008, Czech and Afghan instructors were teaching the fourth group of cadets at the Academy. Each group attended a three-week cycle which included first-aid treatment, tactics, patrolling, weapons training, vehicle-check-point procedures and many other police-related subjects. The practical part of the training also included scenarios where cadets were ambushed by simulated oppositional forces. During 2014 the base was downsized partly by 252 Engineer Company, 223rd Engineer Battalion and was turned over to the ANA. The ANA utilized the northern portion of the base only, which they renamed Camp Maiwand. The last few convoys containing equipment from FOB Shank back to Bagram Airbase were completed during October 2014 by the 730th Transportation Company, 419th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, 4th Resolute Support Sustainment Brigade. Following the shutdown of FOB Shank, a new American base was established nearby, called FOB Dahlke or Camp Dahlke West. Camp Dahlke was expanded in 2018 to support the deployment of the 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade. Camp Dahlke has facilities to house 800 soldiers.

He signed a professional contract with the club in October 1983 and made his first team debut the following month, starting York's 3‚Äì2 victory away at Hartlepool United on 26 November. Pearce scored his first goal one week later on 3 December with York's second goal in a 2‚Äì0 victory at home to Aldershot. He played a useful part in York's 1983‚Äì84 season, making 18 appearances and scoring five goals in all competitions, as the side won the Fourth Division title. In York's first season back in the Third Division, 1984‚Äì85, Pearce made 29 appearances in all competitions. Pearce's season was brought to a premature end after breaking a leg while playing for the reserve team in April 1985.

It takes place in late-Spring and early-Summer in Brisbane, Queensland at venues provided by Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University. The summer school is the only one of its kind in Australia as it features a faculty of both Australian and international coaches and teachers.Lisa Gasteen to shape Australian talent. Griffith University News, 17 November 2011 Endorsed by Lyndon Terracini, artistic director of Opera Australia, the school will take place annually, subject to fundraising.  Faculty and participants  The school launched in 2011 and musical faculty members included Lisa Gasteen AO, John Fisher, Giovanni Reggioli, Margaret Baker-Genovesi, Sharolyn Kimmorley AM and Jill Stoll. UK-based psychotherapist and expert on psychogenic dysphonia (voice problems due to emotional mismanagement) Phiroze Neemuchwala was amongst the members of the non-musical faculty. Faculty members have been associated with leading international and national opera companies such as the Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, Teatro alla Scala, Opera Australia, Teatro la Fenice, New York City Opera, Washington National Opera, Welsh National Opera, the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie, De Nederlandse Opera and Opera Queensland, as well as the Rossini Opera Festival, the Bergamo Donizetti Festival, Caramoor International Music Festival, Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, the Manhattan School of Music, Juilliard School, and both the Decca and Deutsche Grammophon classical recording labels. Participation in the Lisa Gasteen National Opera School is open to both domestic Australian and New Zealand students. Entry is by application and audition, and places are highly competitive and limited in number. Currently, twenty places are offered to participants of all voice-types, as well as four student repetiteur positions.Griffith University News, ibid.  Background and course of study  The school was founded in 2011 by recently retired dramatic soprano Lisa Gasteen, who wanted to use her influence as one of the world's leading Wagnerian sopranos to help music education in Australia. Gasteen's reasons for founding the opera school were manifold. She saw a need to provide an elite opera school for talented young Australian opera singers, whom she believes are increasingly looking to gain experience in Australia before moving overseas to study or work.Opera career cut short, Gasteen's next role is mentor. Sydney Morning Herald, 22 July 2010 The financial benefits of bringing experienced opera coaches to Australia to work with a group of students as opposed to sending one student overseas were also a motivation for founding the school. Lisa Gasteen came out of retirement to raise funds for the inaugural summer school, performing in a fundraising concert with renowned Australian-born international conductor Simone Young.Diva Lisa Gasteen returns for a grand dream. The Australian, 29 April 2011 In its inaugural year, the school ran from Monday 21 November to Sunday 11 December. The school provides a level of education comparable to that of the best schools in the US and Europe, and great attention is paid to suitability of repertoire, style and vocal technique.Griffith University News, ibid. Vocal and repetiteur participants undertake a variety of both individual and ensemble coaching sessions, singing lessons, group \\"life skills\\" sessions, Alexander technique workshops, public and private workshops, and public master classes and performances. In 2011, public master classes included a workshop lecture on the life and works of Claudio Monteverdi and a workshop on recitative and the use of the appoggiatura, both given by Margaret Baker-Genovesi, prominent adjudicator and teacher, and retired opera singer. Giovanni Reggioli, Italian- born freelance conductor and coach, led a masterclass on Italian song. Public performances included an Italian song concert compered by Maestro Reggioli and a gala concert of opera scenes prepared by John Fisher. Lisa Gasteen has discussed plans to develop the summer school into an autonomous opera school in the future, self-sustained by an endowment fund.Sydney Morning Herald, ibid. The Queensland Conservatorium is considered an ideal location for a national opera school due to the high quality of performance venues such as the Conservatorium Theatre and the Concert Hall, as well as the ease of professional collaboration with Opera Queensland, with which the Conservatorium shares premises.The Australian, ibid. In 2012, The Lisa Gasteen National Opera School saw the return of guest coaches John Fisher, Giovanni Reggioli and Sharolyn Kimmorley and the addition of Sigfried Jerusalem and Philip Mayers to the music-teaching staff. German opera agent and advisor Manuela Kursidem was also in attendance at the school to provide first-hand advise to students wishing to sing in Europe. In 2013, the returning faculty was joined by Australian operatic repetiteur and pianist Jennifer Marten- Smith. In 2014, the program expanded to include a fourth week of teaching. The faculty featured returning guest coaches John Fisher, Giovanni Reggioli, Sharolyn Kimmorley and Philip Mayers, now considered core staff of the school. They were joined by world-famous bass and former colleague of Ms Gasteen, Robert Lloyd and repetiteur Richard Hetherington, a member of the permanent music staff at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Hetherington will join the core staff again in 2015, which will include a final Gala Concert featuring the Queensland Symphony Orchestra.  Scholarships and prizes  The summer school provides a variety of scholarships, including four full-tuition scholarships for pianist repetiteurs, seven full and thirteen part-tuition scholarships for opera singers. In 2011 the Australian Singing Competition offered the Lisa Gasteen National Opera School Prize, a full-tuition scholarship, to one semi-finalist.IFAC Australian Singing Competition  Prizes & Opportunities In 2014 and 2015 the Australian Opera Awards Committee provided a full-tuition scholarship to one semi-finalst.

Its toxicity is said to be comparable to nickel tetracarbonyl. Due to its high toxicity, cyclopentadienyl nickel nitrosyl has very limited usage. It was patented as a fuel additive and anti- caking agent, but it was never used for these purposes due to the health hazards it posed. In the past, it was also studied for its spectroscopic qualities, and saw limited use as a catalyst in organic chemical reactions, but it has since been discounted in favor of less toxic compounds.

The Corps responds to nearly 5000 calls for service yearly in Hoboken and, as needed, in neighboring areas. History The Hoboken Volunteer Ambulance Corps was initially formed in the early 1970s to augment the existing emergency medical response, which involved a police officer picking up a doctor from then-St. Mary's Hospital and driving them to the location of the call. The Corps was incorporated in 1971 with fourteen members and an ambulance purchased from Avenel Volunteer First Aid Squad. In the first year, the Corps responded to 648 calls, in 2011, they responded to nearly 5000.Hoboken EMS =Hurricane Sandy= In late October 2012, when much of the Northeastern United States was devastated by Hurricane Sandy, the Corps engaged in a multiple-week-long operation to support the city of Hoboken in its state of emergency.

As with the previous albums, both Jim Matheos and Kevin Moore wrote and recorded alone and sent song ideas back and forth for further elaboration. The album was written and recorded throughout most of 2011. Returning as the band's session drummer was Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree, this time co- writing one of the tracks with the band. All other instruments and programming were performed by both Matheos and Moore, while vocals and lyrics were handled exclusively by Moore. Critical reception for Fire Make Thunder was generally positive while the album sold 1,900 copies in the United States in its first week of release and peaked at position No. 18 on the Top New Artist Albums chart. Background In May 2010 Metal Blade announced they had signed OSI and that guitarist Jim Matheos and keyboardist/vocalist Kevin Moore were currently working on the fourth album originally slated for a late 2010 release. It was not until January 2012 that the fourth album's track list, artwork and release date were revealed. Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree was reenlisted to take the role of session drummer with a co-writing credit for \\"Enemy Prayer\\", which was composed based on Harrison's drum contributions. Unlike previous albums the album marks the first not to feature any additional vocals beyond Moore. Matheos contributed this to the fact that there was ultimately enough material for an entire album and any additional vocals were unnecessary, but the decision to exclude additional vocalists was not necessarily intentional. Moore also stated that the album has a mood of consistency, better production and is more organic and unified than any previous release. Jimmy Ahlander directed a music video for the track \\"For Nothing\\". Music In a similar fashion to previous records, the album was recorded in each musician's respective home studio with much development occurring within exchanges of material between Matheos and Moore. Matheos describes this practice as both a choice and a necessity that allows both musicians \\"to take our time to explore different ideas to really experiment on our own before we present ideas to each other.\\" Moore regarded Fire Make Thunder as \\"'real instrument' sounding, low-fi kind of [album]\\" with an emphasis on \\"organic\\" sounds. Matheos said the album was \\"little less of the heavy guitar-driven things\\", noting that it is \\"heavy\\" in the sense of themes, lyrics and mood rather than in the typical \\"heavy-metal\\" sense explaining, \\"I think it was a consistent dark mood throughout the whole thing. And that's not to say that it's extremely mellow all the way through. It does have heavy guitar parts throughout.\\" Moore stated that he strived to form a sense of unity throughout the album based on this organic sound with a \\"lot of mellotron-ish and analog synth sounds and not so much digital pads or programming\\" as opposed to the \\"high-def brilliant sounds\\" of past efforts. Moore defines his lyrical methodology as similar to the way he approaches creating music. \\"I start to come up with melodies as soon as I can. So I might record melodies without words, sort of mumble them. I keep myself at low volume\\", admitting the ridiculousness of the sound. Moreover, he states that once he records a general melody he will begin to play back the material to develop accents and phrasing to match the music. He explains \\"It's sort of a subliminal thing that you are telling yourself what the song is about somehow, from there I try to make sense of lyrics and make something that does make sense, I don't want to make something that is sort of a stream on conscious sort of thing that has a theme that people can connect to ‚Äì I tried to make it so with every song, you know what it's about, not about a million things, just one thing.\\" Matheos reiterates that rather than typical songwriting \\"starting with a riff or a chord progression, [most songs] start with a sound.\\" Release and promotion Fire Make Thunder was released by Metal Blade Records on March 27, 2012. Once again Moore and Matheos have deliberated and expressed interest in a live performance. Moore said it was something \\"always on our minds\\" and discussed the idea of performing a live studio version before embarking on any larger scale tours. With no plans yet solidified with the label it remains a possibility. Reception Critical reception for Fire Make Thunder was generally favorable. Todd Lyons of About.com gave the album 4 out of 5 stars and described the album as \\"evocative progressive metal, with the emphasis on the progressive\\" saying it \\"melts together from one track to the next to give it an artsy yet satisfying integrity\\". Ken McGrath of Blistering gave the album 7 out of 10, stating that it \\"may require a little work initially from the listener\\", but called it a \\"real charmer of an album\\" consisting of \\"sepia-toned memory spiral\\", \\"big, fuzzy guitar chorus [riffs]\\" and \\"shimmering notes as if water dripping down glass\\". Bloody Disgusting's Jonathan Barkan defined the album as \\"a sonic journey where new and amazing tones and sounds assault you from all sides constantly\\" noting \\"something very industrial ‚Ä¶ not referring to the electronic subgenre\\" but a vision of \\"steel factories ‚Ä¶ grimy smokestacks rising up, a dark smog cloud hanging overhead ‚Ä¶ it sounds fantastic\\". Fire Make Thunder sold 1,900 copies in the United States in its first week of release. It peaked at No. 18 on Heatseekers Albums charts for the week of April 14, 2012 and on the Top Hard Music Albums Chart at No. 46. Internationally the album was featured on the Hard Music chart in Canada at No. 43 and No. 139 on the charts in Benelux.

The EHT project combines data from several very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) stations around Earth with angular resolution sufficient to observe objects the size of a supermassive black hole's event horizon. The project's observational targets include the two black holes with the largest angular diameter as observed from Earth: the black hole at the center of the supergiant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 (M87), and Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) at the center of the Milky Way. The Event Horizon Telescope project is an international collaboration launched in 2009 after a long period of theoretical and technical developments. On the theory side, work on the photon orbit and first simulations of what a black hole would look like progressed to predictions of VLBI imaging for the Galactic Center black hole, Sgr A*. Technical advances in radio observing moved from the first detection of Sgr A*, through VLBI at progressively shorter wavelengths, ultimately leading to detection of horizon scale structure in both Sgr A* and M87. The collaboration now comprises over 300 members, 60 institutions, working over 20 countries and regions. The first image of a black hole, at the center of galaxy Messier 87, was published by the EHT Collaboration on April 10, 2019, in a series of six scientific publications. The array made this observation at a wavelength of 1.3 mm and with a theoretical diffraction- limited resolution of . Future plans involve improving the array's resolution by adding new telescopes and by taking shorter-wavelength observations.  Telescope array  Soft X-ray image of Sagittarius A* (center) and two light echoes from a recent explosion (circled) A schematic diagram of the VLBI mechanism of EHT. Each antenna, spread out over vast distances, has an extremely precise atomic clock. Analogue signals collected by the antenna are converted to digital signals and stored on hard drives together with the time signals provided by the atomic clock. The hard drives are then shipped to a central location to be synchronized. An astronomical observation image is obtained by processing the data gathered from multiple locations. The EHT is composed of many radio observatories or radio telescope facilities around the world, working together to produce a high-sensitivity, high-angular-resolution telescope. Through the technique of very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI), many independent radio antennas separated by hundreds or thousands of kilometres can act as a phased array, a virtual telescope which can be pointed electronically, with an effective aperture which is the diameter of the entire planet, substantially improving its angular resolution. The effort includes development and deployment of submillimeter dual polarization receivers, highly stable frequency standards to enable very-long-baseline interferometry at 230‚Äì450 GHz, higher-bandwidth VLBI backends and recorders, as well as commissioning of new submillimeter VLBI sites. Each year since its first data capture in 2006, the EHT array has moved to add more observatories to its global network of radio telescopes. The first image of the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, was expected to be produced in April 2017, but because the South Pole Telescope is closed during winter (April to October), the data shipment delayed the processing to December 2017 when the shipment arrived. Data collected on hard drives are transported by commercial freight airplanes (a so-called sneakernet) from the various telescopes to the MIT Haystack Observatory and the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, where the data are cross-correlated and analyzed on a grid computer made from about 800 CPUs all connected through a network. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, weather patterns, and celestial mechanics, the 2020 observational campaign was postponed to March 2021.  Messier 87*  First image of the shadow of a black hole (M87*) captured by the Event Horizon Telescope The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration announced its first results in six simultaneous press conferences worldwide on April 10, 2019. The announcement featured the first direct image of a black hole, which showed the supermassive black hole at the center of Messier 87, designated M87*. The scientific results were presented in a series of six papers published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. The image provided a test for Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity under extreme conditions. Studies have previously tested general relativity by looking at the motions of stars and gas clouds near the edge of a black hole. However, an image of a black hole brings observations even closer to the event horizon. Relativity predicts a dark shadow-like region, caused by gravitational bending and capture of light, which matches the observed image. The published paper states: \\"Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a spinning Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity.\\" Paul T.P. Ho, EHT Board member, said: \\"Once we were sure we had imaged the shadow, we could compare our observations to extensive computer models that include the physics of warped space, superheated matter, and strong magnetic fields. Many of the features of the observed image match our theoretical understanding surprisingly well.\\" The image also provided new measurements for the mass and diameter of M87*. EHT measured the black hole's mass to be and measured the diameter of its event horizon to be approximately , roughly 2.5 times smaller than the shadow that it casts, seen at the center of the image. Previous observations of M87 showed that the large-scale jet is inclined at an angle of 17¬∞ relative to the observer's line of sight and oriented on the plane of the sky at a position angle of ‚àí72¬∞. From the enhanced brightness of the southern part of the ring due to relativistic beaming of approaching funnel wall jet emission, EHT concluded the black hole, which anchors the jet, spins clockwise, as seen from Earth. EHT simulations allow for both prograde and retrograde inner disk rotation with respect to the black hole, while excluding zero black hole spin using a conservative minimum jet power of 1042 erg/s via the Blandford-Znajek process.R. D. Blandford and R. L. Znajek, \\"Electromagnetic extraction of energy from Kerr black holes\\", Mon. Not. R. Astr. Soc. 179:433-456 (1977). Producing an image from data from an array of radio telescopes requires much mathematical work. Four independent teams created images to assess the reliability of the results. These methods included both an established algorithm in radio astronomy for image reconstruction known as CLEAN, invented by Jan H√∂gbom, as well as self- calibrating image processing methodsSAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS): Seitz, Schneider, and Bartelmann (1998) Entropy-regularized maximum-likelihood cluster mass reconstruction cites Narayan and Nityananda 1986. for astronomy such as the CHIRP algorithm created by Katherine Bouman and others.

In March 2020, astronomers proposed a way of better seeing more of the rings in the first black hole image.  3C 279  EHT image of the archetypal blazar 3C 279 showing a relativistic jet down to the AGN core surrounding the supermassive black hole. In April 2020, the EHT released the first 20 microarcsecond resolution images of the archetypal blazar 3C 279 it observed in April 2017. These images, generated from observations over 4 nights in April 2017, reveal bright components of a jet whose projection on the observer plane exhibit apparent superluminal motions with speeds up to 20 c. Such apparent superluminal motion from relativistic emitters such as an approaching jet is explained by emission originating closer to the observer (downstream along the jet) catching up with emission originating further from the observer (at the jet base) as the jet propagates close to the speed of light at small angles to the line of sight.

From 2005 IWRG has promoted a fall show, around the Mexican Day of the Death, under the name El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\") to distinguish it from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG Guerra del Golfo (\\"Gulf War\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\") or IWRG Prison Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The Castillo del Terror shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2006 Castillo del Terror show was the first that IWRG promoted a show under that name. =Storylines= The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension- building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

To date, she has released five full-length studio albums, toured with notable international artists, and embarked on an acting career which has garnered positive attention from critics and bloggers. Her first full-length film, I Used to Be Darker, premiered in January 2013. Biography =Music career= Originally from Florida, Taylor played instruments in school bands and sang in church as a child. She began performing professionally at age 18. \\"I have always done music in some fashion,\\" Taylor said. \\"I played piano as a kid and played flute in the marching band at Murray Middle School.\\" In 1996, she relocated to Cincinnati to pursue an English degree, and entered the local music scene of the city. After garnering positive word-of-mouth and promising reviews and radio play for her earliest releases, So Black, So Bright (2002) and Extended Play (2004), Kim began work on what would become I Feel Like a Fading Light (2006). She also self-released a live album, Live at the Miramar (2002), around the release of her debut \\"So Black, So Bright\\". I Feel Like A Fading Light was recorded in New York City alongside Jimi Zhivago, former guitarist for the Roots music purveyors Ollabelle. The music was performed almost entirely by Kim and Zhivago, except for drums (which were provided by Mars Volta's Blake Fleming, Devon Ashley of The Lemonheads and Those Young Lions, and local musician Josh Seurkamp).http://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/print- article-1544-print.html The album was released digitally, as well as on CD (however, they were only sold at shows). It was released on vinyl in December 2008. The album was at one point dubbed an \\"Album of the Week\\" on NPR's World Cafe (via WXPN/NPR Music). After touring in support of the record, Taylor began work on a set of songs that would become the EP, The Greatest Story (2008). She recorded the EP with producer Mike Deneen (known for his work with Fountains of Wayne, Howie Day, and Aimee Mann) \\"That project is part of a bigger picture that I'll finish and release as a full length.\\" Taylor told Paste magazine after being named \\"Best of What's Next\\" in 2009. She continued playing shows and festivals such as NYC's CMJ Music Marathon and returned to Austin's SXSW Music, this time promoting the EP. She toured extensively with Over the Rhine, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Ron Sexsmith, as well as with her friend, Lexington cellist Ben Sollee. Taylor and Sollee had done occasional shows together since 2007, but this tour found them playing both solo material, and accompanying one another during each other's sets. In 2010, Kim released Little Miracle. Written and recorded in just three days, it too was recorded with Jimi Zhivago. However, this time, all instruments were played by Taylor and Zhivago: \\"I always write on both piano and guitar. Piano was my first instrument. The new project is just me and my friend Jimi Zhivago (out of NYC and plays with the band Ollabelle.) We play everything on it: guitars, piano, organs, percussion, etc.\\" In 2013, Taylor worked again with Jimi Zhivago to release \\"Love's A Dog.\\" \\"Songs of Instruction\\"‚ÄîTaylor's 5th full-length record and first co-production‚Äîwas released on February 22, 2019. =Music in film and television= Taylor's songs have been included in such shows as Smallville, Justified, Eli Stone, One Tree Hill, Ghost Whisperer, Flashpoint, Army Wives, Hawthorne, The Unit, All My Children, and Days of Our Lives. Her songs \\"No More War\\" and \\"A Good Man\\" can also be found on the soundtrack for the 2005 film, My Brother's War. In 2009, she signed a nonexclusive licensing agreement with MTV so that the network can use her songs on some of their hit shows. Additionally, she struck a deal with Revlon in 2010, for her song \\"Little Miracle\\" to be used in an ad campaign. In 2019, \\"The Hard Way\\" from Taylor's \\"Songs of Instruction\\" was used in the Chinese thriller film Sheep Without A Shepherd directed by Sam Quah. = Film = Taylor starred in director Matthew Porterfield's independent film, I Used to Be Darker, about a pregnant Northern Irish runaway who seeks refuge with family in Baltimore, MD, only to find her aunt on the verge of divorce. Taylor plays the aunt (who like Taylor, is a singer-songwriter named Kim). The film premiered in January 2013, at the Sundance Film Festival. It then gave its international film premier at the Berlinale in Berlin, Germany in February 2013. To accompany the launch of the film, Taylor also performed at Sundance's ASCAP Cafe in January 2013. The film was funded by use of the pledge-platform Kickstarter and began filming in August 2011. The film was ranked as one of IndieWire's \\"Most Anticipated Indie Films of 2012\\" and is #27 on IONCINEMA's \\"Top 100 Most Anticipated Films of 2012\\" list. Post-premier, the film received positive reviews from such publications as The New Yorker and Time Out Chicago. =Personal life= Kim was born in Miami, Florida. Her father grew up in Alexandria, Virginia and her mother in Lakeland, Florida. Taylor's father was a PATCO air-traffic controller and is now president of the re- formed Union. Kim is an only child. She is married and has one son. For several years, she also owned a much-loved coffee shop, Pleasant Perk, in Cincinnati. \\"The shop serves a lot of purposes for me,\\" she says. \\"It quickly relieves the tension when I come back from playing music.

History The origins of the IOM date back to 1818, when the Russian Academy of Sciences learned that Louis-Jacques Rousseau (1780‚Äì1831), the French consul at Aleppo and Tripoli (then both part of the Ottoman Empire), was selling his extensive collection of manuscripts written in the Arabic script. In November of that year, the president of the RAS, Count Sergey Uvarov, wrote to the Board of the RAS requesting that a separate room be put aside in the Academy's cabinet of curiosities for storing this collection of manuscripts (which was eventually purchased by the RAS in two tranches, in 1819 and 1825), as well as other medals, manuscripts and books of oriental origin already in the Museum of the Imperial Academy of Science. The result was the establishment of the Asiatic Museum () of the RAS, in Saint Petersburg. The Asiatic Museum quickly established itself as the main institute for the collection and study of oriental manuscripts and books in Russia, as well as a major international centre for oriental studies, and by the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917, almost a hundred years after its foundation, it housed one of the most extensive collections of oriental manuscripts and printed books in the world. Following the Russian Revolution, the Asiatic Museum continued under the same name until May 1930, when the Institute of Oriental Studies (IOS) of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR was founded, and the Asiatic Museum was incorporated into this new institute. The IOS was originally located within the Library of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Leningrad (the name for Saint Petersburg during the Soviet era), but in 1949 it moved to its own premises in one wing of the New Michael Palace (the other wing was occupied by the Institute for the History of Material Culture). Then two years later, in 1951, the institute was relocated to its own premises in Moscow. However, for practical reasons the institute's main library and its collections of manuscripts and early printed books remained at the New Michael Palace in Leningrad as the Department of Oriental Manuscripts of the IOS. Five years after the move of the IOS to Moscow, in February 1956, the Department of Oriental Manuscripts in Leningrad was reconstituted as the Leningrad Branch of the IOS. Whereas the main Moscow branch of the IOS concentrated on modern studies, the Leningrad branch specialized in the study of ancient and medieval oriental history, literature and languages, as well as in the production of critical editions of texts in its collections. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, it continued as a branch of the IOS, albeit now renamed the Saint Petersburg Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, until 2007. In 2007 the Saint Petersburg branch separated from the IOS to become an independent institute under the RAS. The new institute, which assumed the title of Institute of Oriental Manuscripts in late 2009, continues to occupy one wing of the New Michael Palace.

The manuscript was acquired by Tsar Nicholas II in 1909, and transferred from the Russian Museum to the Asiatic Museum in 1921. The foundation for the manuscript collection at the Asiatic Museum were some 700 Arabic script manuscripts belonging to Jean-Baptiste Louis-Jacques Rousseau that were acquired in 1819 (500 manuscripts) and 1826 (200 manuscripts). The first director of the Asiatic Museum, Christian Martin Fr√§hn, augmented the museum's holdings in Arabic manuscripts, and by 1828 the museum housed some 851 Arabic, Persian and Turkic manuscripts. However, the collection of Arabic manuscripts did not grow substantially until the early 20th century. In 1915, Vladimir Alexeyevich Ivanov purchased some 1,057 manuscripts from Bukhara, and in 1916‚Äì1917, S. V. Ter-Avetisyan, curator of the Caucasian Museum in Tbilisi, sent a large number of manuscripts that he had collected to the Asiatic Museum, including more than a thousand Arabic manuscripts. =Tibetan collection= The IOM has one of the largest collections of Tibetan books and manuscripts in the world, comprising over 20,000 catalogued items, as well as many as yet uncatalogued items. The history of the collection dates back to the 1720s when Tibetan texts from a ruined monastery along the Irtysh River were brought back to Saint Petersburg. During the 18th and 19th centuries more Tibetan and Tibeto-Mongolian woodblock-printed books were collected from Buryat monasteries in Siberia. Other Tibetan and Mongolian books were sent back to Russia by members of the Russian Spiritual Mission in China during the 19th century. By the start of the 20th century the Asiatic Museum had the largest collection of Tibetan books and manuscripts in Europe, but it was still deficient in some areas. The remaining gaps in the collection were filled by Gombojab Tsybikov and B. Baradiyn (1878‚Äì1937) who visited Tibet in 1899‚Äì1902 and 1905‚Äì1907 respectively. =Manuscripts from Khara-khoto= The IOM holds the world's foremost collection of manuscripts written in the extinct Tangut language, which were collected by the explorer Pyotr Kozlov from the Western Xia fortress city of Khara-Khoto in Inner Mongolia during 1907‚Äì1909. The city had been abandoned in the late 14th century, and had been largely buried in sand for several hundred years. Kozlov unearthed thousands of manuscripts and woodblock prints, mostly written in the dead Tangut script, which had been preserved beneath the sands of Khara-Khoto. The manuscripts, books and archaeological artefacts that Kozlov brought back from Khara-Khoto were originally housed in the museum of Alexander III of Russia in Saint Petersburg, but the manuscripts and printed books were transferred to the Asiatic Museum in 1911. In addition to the several thousand Tangut texts, the Kozlov Collection includes about 660 manuscripts and printed books in Chinese, mostly Buddhist texts, as well as about 120 Tibetan texts. =Manuscripts from Turpan and Dunhuang= Sergey Oldenburg, director of the Asiatic Museum from 1916, made two expeditions to Central Asia (1909‚Äì1910 and 1914‚Äì1915). During the first expedition Oldenburg explored a number of sites around Turpan, including Shikchin, Yarkhoto and Kucha, and collected murals, paintings, terracottas, and about one hundred manuscripts, mostly fragments written in the Brahmi script. During his second expedition Oldenburg surveyed the Mogao Caves at Dunhuang, and revisited some of the sites in Turpan that he had visited during his first expedition. He found a large number of artefacts and manuscript fragments (nearly 20,000 fragments, some of them tiny) at Dunhuang, and also purchased about 300 scrolls from local people. The IOM holds the more than 19,000 manuscript fragments and 365 manuscript scrolls collected from Dunhuang by Oldenburg, as well as about thirty manuscripts collected by Sergey Malov during an expedition to Khotan during 1909‚Äì1910, and some 183 Uyghur manuscripts collected by N. N. Krotkov, the Russian Consul in Urumqi and Ghulja. =Individual manuscripts and printed books= * Nova N 176 ‚Äî the only known complete manuscript of the extinct Khitan language, written in the Khitan large script. * Pearl in the Palm ‚Äî 12th century woodblock printing of a bilingual Chinese‚ÄìTangut glossary See also * International Dunhuang Project References External links * Web site of the Institute of Oriental manuscripts Category:Asian studies ","title":"Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences"},{"id":"34573546","text":"Sorkh Dom-e Laki (, also Romanized as Sorkh Dom-e Lakƒ´; also known as Dom Sorkh Lakƒ´) is a village in Kuhdasht-e Shomali Rural District, in the Central District of Kuhdasht County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

The show featured the eponymous main event match; a nine-man Steel Cage Match where the last twp men in the cage were forced to wrestle each other and the loser would be forced to unmask under Luchas de Apuestas, or \\"Bet rules\\". For the 2006 event Ave F√©nix, Bacteria, Fabi√°n el Gitano, Fantasma de la √ìpera, El Felino, El Hijo del Diablo, Macho II, Nitro and Xibalva all wagered their masks on the outcome of the match. The match came down to Ave F√©nix and Macho II, with F√©nix pinning Macho II to force him to unmask afterwards. Production =Background= Starting as far back as at least 2002, the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. From 2005 IWRG has promoted a fall show, around the Mexican Day of the Death, under the name El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\") to distinguish it from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG Guerra del Golfo (\\"Gulf War\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\") or IWRG Prison Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The Castillo del Terror shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2006 Castillo del Terror show was the second year in a row that IWRG promoted a show under that name. =Storylines= The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Its dimensions were approximately 30*10*10 cm, or three CubeSat units long, making it three times larger than TechEdSat-1. TechEdSat-3p was launched to the International Space Station on 20 November 2013 from Tanegashima, Japan on the HTV-4 International Space Station cargo resupply mission and subsequently deployed into orbit by the JEM-Small Satellite Orbital Deployer. TechEdSat-3p was the first satellite of the TechEdSat series to include an exo-brake, a parachute-like drag device to demonstrate passive deorbit capability.TechEdSat 3 (accessed 12 Sept 2014) The deployment of an exo-brake increases the surface area of a satellite, increasing its coefficient of drag in the thin upper atmosphere and causing the satellite to deorbit faster than it otherwise would. This technology could be used to more quickly dispose of satellites in Low Earth Orbit that have completed their missions, decreasing the amount of potentially hazardous debris in space. The exo-brake is currently being developed for use as part of the Small Payload Quick Return concept, which would enable science materials to be returned to Earth from the International Space Station whenever is most convenient for scientists rather than just a few times per year aboard a returning cargo resupply vehicle. According to smallsat logistics company √ÖAC Microtech, a main power distribution board designed for TechEdSat-1 was reused on the TechEdSat-3p mission. NSSDCA ID: TECHEDS3P Deployment of the TechEdSat-3p satellite from the ISS  TechEdSat-4  TechEdSat-4 was a 3U CubeSat mission developed, integrated, and tested at NASA Ames in partnership with student interns from San Jose State University in California and the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho. The objective of the TechEdSat-4 mission was to demonstrate new technologies including satellite-to-satellite communications and an upgraded Exo-Brake device to demonstrate a passive deorbiting. TechEdSat-4 was launched as a secondary cargo payload on the Cygnus CRS Orb-2 ISS resupply mission. The launch vehicle was the Orbital Sciences Corporation Antares-120, launching from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on Wallops Island, VA on 13 July 2014.TechEdSat-4 (Technological and Educational Nanosatellite-4) (accessed 12 Sept 2014) TechEdSat-4 was deployed from the International Space Station via the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer on 4 March 2015.The Development of On-Demand Sample Return Capability (SPQR) (TechEdSat-4) - 05.24.17TechEdSat-4 (Technological and Educational Nanosatellite-4) On Feb. 27 2015, a series of CubeSats, small experimental satellites, were deployed via a special device mounted on the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS). Deployed satellites included twelve Dove sats, TechEdSat-4, GEARRSat, LambdaSat, and MicroMas.  TechEdSat-5  TechEdSat-5 was a 4 kg, 3.5U CubeSat that was launched on 9 December 2016 aboard the HTV-6 cargo resupply spacecraft, and was deployed from the International Space Station at 18:20 UTC on 6 March 2017. It was the first satellite in the TechEdSat program to include a modulated Exo-Brake that was could adjust the amount of atmospheric drag on the spacecraft, enabling a targeted re-entry. The TechEdSat-5 Exo-Brake was cross-shaped, made of mylar, and used a combination of mechanical struts and flexible cords. Its surface area was approximately 0.35 square metres. A ‚ÄòCricket‚Äô Wireless Sensor Module (WSM) was included with TechEdSat-5. The satellite reentered the atmosphere on July 29, 2017 after successfully operating for 144 days. none TechEdSat-6 TechEdSat-6 was a CubeSat that was launched at 12:19 UTC on 12 November 2017 aboard the Cygnus CRS-8 cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station. It was deployed from the NanoRacks Nanolauncher on 20 November 2017. In addition to the primary payload, it contained a CubeSat Identity Tag (CUBIT), a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag developed by DARPA and SRI International to assist in future identification of satellites. It successfully reentered the atmosphere on 14 May 2018. TechEdSat-6, seen here just after being deployed from the International Space Station, was a cubesat mission that tested technologies intended to make it easier to return science materials to Earth from space.  TechEdSat-7  TechEdSat-7 is a 2U CubeSat that is intended to test a High Packing Density Exo-Brake. It is planned to launch on Virgin Orbit's LauncherOne as part of NASA's ELaNa program. It will fly with a CubeSat Identity Tag (CUBIT), a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag developed by DARPA and SRI International to assist in future identification of satellites. Operators: SJSU, NASA Ames Research Center  TechEdSat-8  TechEdSat-8 was a 6 unit CubeSat that included an exo-brake designed for continued operation in high temperature environments. This technology, known as a \\"Hot Exo-Brake\\" could enable more precisely-targeted atmospheric reentries. An ablation device was also flying on the spacecraft. TechEdSat-8 was originally planned to launch with the Cygnus NG-10 cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station as part of the ELaNa program, but instead launched aboard the SpaceX CRS-16 ISS cargo resupply mission at 18:16 UTC on 5 December, arriving at the ISS on 8 December 2018. TechEdSat-8 was deployed into orbit by the JEM-Small Satellite Orbital Deployer at 16:45 UTC on 31 January 2019. The satellite established communication with controllers and, as of 20 February 2019, was reportedly performing well in advance of a targeted reentry. The satellite failed shortly after launch due to a loss of power from its solar panels, and re-entered Earth's atmosphere on 20 April 2020. An exploded view of TechEdSat-8, a satellite designed to test communication and precision deorbit technologies.  TechEdSat-10  TechEdSat-10 is a 6U (previously planned as 3U) CubeSat that was selected in 2018 to launch as part of the ELaNa program. On 15 February 2020, TechEdSat-10 was launched to the ISS aboard the Cygnus NG-13 cargo spacecraft. Deployed on 13 July 2020, TechEdSat-10 will test radio communication devices, precision deorbit technologies for NOAA and others, radiation tolerant electronics, and artificial intelligence hardware for future experiments.  Future TechEdSats  TechEdSat-9 and TechEdSat-11 are planned to fly at some point in the future. TechEdSat-9, like TechEdSat-10, is planned to test radio communication technologies for NOAA and others. TechEdSat-12 will test technologies for the tracking and identification of small satellites. It will carry a radio- frequency identificaition (RFID) tag, a radar reflector, and an L-band antenna. It was selected for launch in February 2020 by NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative, and will be delivered to orbit on a launch contracted through the ELaNa program.

The episode was written by Soo Hugh and was directed by Jennifer Getzinger. In the episode, the Larsens plan their daughter's funeral. Detectives Sarah Linden and Stephen Holder are drawn to Bennet Ahmed, Rosie's literature teacher, who has a questionable past and pregnant young wife. The episode's title is a quote from West with the Night by Beryl Markham, and the quote is found in a letter to Rosie. Plot Kris Echols (Gharrett Patrick Paon) fidgets in an interrogation room, while Detectives Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) and Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman) watch. Linden enters to question him, but Echols denies killing Rosie. She shows him a video of Rosie at the Halloween dance. He remains stoic. Holder ponders to Lieutenant Oakes (Garry Chalk) that Kris, desperate for meth, will soon crack. Oakes tells Holder that Holder looks worse than the suspect and to clean himself up. Linden sets up Kris so he sees Jasper (Richard Harmon) and his lawyer (Fred Henderson) entering an interrogation room across the hall. Holder hints to Kris that Jasper's lawyer is cutting a deal. Linden plays the cell-phone footage from The Cage for Jasper, who claims it's not what it appears to be. Across the hall, Kris explains that he would never hurt Rosie because she was nice to him. When shown the same cell-phone footage, Kris scoffs that the police don't know anything. Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell) is told that Mayor Adams has opened an eight-point lead. Gwen Eaton (Kristin Lehman) suggests that he asks Tom Drexler, a wealthy entrepreneur who loathes Adams, to finance a media package. Richmond declines. Mayor Adams (Tom Butler) meets Jamie Wright (Eric Ladin) at a bar and invites him to join his ‚Äúwinning team.‚Äù When longtime donors spurn Richmond, Gwen Eaton secretly calls her father, Senator Eaton (Alan Dale), asking him to arrange a meeting between Richmond and Drexler. He admires her creativity, but criticizes her for having sex with Richmond. At the high school, Sterling (Kacey Rohl) confesses that she's the girl in the cell-phone video. She explains that she was tired of never being noticed when Rosie was around and went to the Cage with Jasper, because she was drunk and he was nice to her, adding that she was wearing Rosie's costume because Rosie had left the dance. She also claims the blood found there was from one of her nosebleeds. Noting that Rosie sometimes boarded a bus after school, Sterling thinks that Rosie was secretly meeting someone. Holder says that he will follow up with the Larsens, but Linden says she will handle it, eliciting grumbles from Holder. Later, at the police station, she questions the Larsens about Rosie's possible affair. Mitch (Michelle Forbes) doesn't believe that has occurred. The Larsens then visit a priest (David Abbott) at a church to make arrangements for Rosie's funeral. Mitch fixates on the tortured Christ on the crucifix at the church. Mitch asks the priest where God was when her daughter needed Him. Gwen Eaton and Darren Richmond arrive at Drexler's penthouse for a party also attended by Adams. In private, Drexler (Patrick Gilmore) gives Richmond a $50,000 check, claiming that he wants the mayor to know that he helped him lose the election. Richmond then secretly meets with Jamie Wright, who provides Richmond with an update on Adams and asks him how he knew Wright wasn't the leak. Richmond jokes that Jamie would have found a smarter way to ruin him. Stan Larsen (Brent Sexton) drives his employee and friend, Belko Royce (Brendan Sexton III), to a suburban home. It was to be a surprise purchase for Mitch, but now he cannot afford it. Belko offers to take care of Richmond, referring to a contract killing. Stan replies that he doesn't do that anymore. He later enters a Polish restaurant to see Janek Kovarsky (Don Thompson), who scolds Stan about ignoring him for the past 17 years. After Stan explains his financial situation, Janek offers several thousand dollars, saying that family always comes first. Stan responds that they were never family, before taking the money. He later stashes the money in a drawer at his moving-company office. At their home above the business, Stan looks for a funeral dress in Rosie's closet. When Linden arrives to search the bedroom, she apologizes for their seeing crime-scene photographs earlier. Stan chastises her for not being honest with them. At school, a boy mocks Sterling by approaching her at her locker and groping her, while suggesting a trip down to the Cage. Shaken, she fends off this sexual harassment and moments later, Mitch arrives. She sees Sterling in the hallway. She hugs Sterling, telling her that she's not to blame for Rosie's death. Sterling tells Mitch that Rosie was happy on Friday night and that she doesn't know whom Rosie may have been seeing. Later, teacher Bennet Ahmed (Brandon Jay McLaren) discovers Mitch on a bench in the hallway. He tells her that her daughter was a smart and eager girl. He shows her a copy of Rosie's favorite book. Following Linden's orders, Holder rides the bus that Sterling had mentioned. He shows a picture of Rosie to the driver, but he doesn't remember every passenger's face. Holder is about to give up, when a new driver takes over. He shows this driver the picture and is told that she was an occasional passenger who rode to the end of the line. At the end of the bus line, Holder follows a student wearing a high school varsity jacket to the headquarters of the Seattle All-Stars after-school basketball program. He begins showing Rosie's photo around. He is directed to a photo of one of the teams, along with their coach, Bennet Ahmed. Meanwhile, Linden discovers several handwritten letters hidden in Rosie's room. She reads a lengthy one, which is signed \\"Bennet.\\" At the high school, Bennet offers Rosie's book as a keepsake to Mitch. Production In an interview with Mina Hochberg at AMCTV.com, Patrick Gilmore spoke about from whom he modeled his character, Tom Drexler: \\"The model they gave me was Mark Cuban. I don't think it's a direct impersonation, but it's definitely somewhere to start: a self- made millionaire, young, has the world at his hands and is able to manipulate the environment and the world around him. That's clearly something that Drexler has an ability to do.\\" Reception \\"A Soundless Echo\\" received favorable reviews. The A.V. Club's Meredith Blake rated this episode a B+, saying \\"In most other ways, the goal of this episode is establishing character and fleshing out backstory, rather [than] propelling the plot forward ‚Äî though, on a show like The Killing, these things are all related anyway.\\" Teresa L. of TV Fanatic gave the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated \\"It was good to get some idea of Linden's motivation, but future [episodes] might need to give us a little more excitement to keep things from getting a little stale.\\" The episode was watched by 2.51 million viewers, a slight decline from the previous episode . Note The letter discovered at the end of the episode is an excerpt from West with the Night by Beryl Markham. The letter states, \\"Dear Rosie, You're an old soul trapped in a young body. Go beyond the limits of what you know even if you're afraid. Try everything, feel everything, if only once. This passage made me think of you today.\\" > \\"There are all kinds of silences and each of them means a different thing. > There is the silence that comes with morning in a forest, and this is > different from the silence of a sleeping city. There is silence after a > rainstorm, and before a rainstorm, and these are not the same. There is the > silence of emptiness, the silence of fear, the silence of doubt. There is a > certain silence that can emanate from a lifeless object as from a chair > lately used, or from a piano with old dust upon its keys, or from anything > that has answered to the need of a man, for pleasure or for work.

She was the focus of a protest against the Tea Act in Charleston, South Carolina in 1774. In 1796 she transported convicts from Ireland to Australia. This voyage was noteworthy for her captain's cruelty, for which he was tried but not sanctioned. She then sailed to China to pick up a cargo for the East India Company. On the way she visited or saw four islands in the present-day Marshall Islands. She remained employed in the services of the East India Company (EIC) until 1799. She then traded with India for a number of years, twice taking cargoes back to England for the EIC. Between 1808 and 1809 she was a whaler in the South Seas Fishery. Voyages In November 1774, Britannia sailed from London to Charleston, South Carolina. In addition to passengers, she was carrying \\"seven chests of East Indian tea.\\" The Captain, Samuel Ball, Jr., said that the tea had been ordered \\"without his knowledge or consent.\\" Because of local objections to the British duty on tea, \\"on Thursday at Noon [November 3, 1774], an Oblation was made to Neptune.\\" This incident has been called \\"The Charleston Tea Party\\" because the tea was dumped over the side, in the same fashion as had occurred at the Boston Tea Party a year earlier. Captain Thomas Dennett (or Dennott) sailed Britannia from Calcutta on 28 November 1785 and Diamond Harbour on 4 January 1786. She reached the Cape on 2 March, and St Helena on 23 March.

She embarked 144 male and 44 female prisoners; ten male convicts and one female convict died during the course of the voyage.Bateson (1959), p.153.

The enquiry recommendations as to Demmett's \\"callous and brutal\\" treatment of the convicts was sent to England but the only repercussion was that Demmett never served on a convict ship again.Bateson (1959), pp.142-147. =Exploration= Britannia left Sydney on 2 August 1797 for China, where she would pick up a cargo of tea. She initially followed the route that Scarborough followed. Britannia sailed north and into the region of the Marshall Islands. On 19 September she sighted an island that Dennott named \\"Hunter Island\\" (Kili Island). Canoes brought out some islanders who wanted to trade breadfruit. The next day she sighted an island in the Ailinglaplap Atoll that Dennott named \\"Lamber Island\\". Natives again came out to trade but Britannia sailed on. Later that day Britannia did stop at an island in Namu Atoll that Dennott named \\"Ross Island\\". This time Britannia stopped and traded with the natives who came out. One native tore off a galley rail and took it away as a prize. On 21 September Britannia sighted \\"Princess Island\\" at ; this would appear to be Lib Island. Dennett arrived at Macao on 16 October 1797 and was at Whampoa on 2 December. For her return to Britain, Britannia was at Macao on 28 March 1798, False Bay on 25 July, the Cape on 8 September, and St Helena on 17 November. Britannia reached the Downs on 4 February 1799. She reached London on 7 February. Dennott left Britannia and apparently died around 1800. Lloyd's Register for 1800 records her owner as Lambert, and her master as \\"Palmer\\". London-India trade Captain Edward Hanoner Palmer received a letter of marque of Britannia on 1 May 1799. On 28 May Britannia sailed from London for Madras. On 24 September she left the Cape in company with the American armed ship Atlantic. The two planned on sailing together as far as \\"Achun Head\\" (Aceh). On 8 October a ship came into sight and appeared to be chasing them, but they separated and both escaped.Williams (2009), p.69. Palmer and Britannia left Madras on 16 April 1800, reached St Helena on 8 July, and arrived at The Downs on 23 September.British Library: Britannia (8). Britannia arrived back in London on 30 September. Lloyd's Register for 1801 repeats the names of owner and master from the prior volume, but indicates a change with the name of Britannias new owner as \\"Cleland Co.\\" and the name of her master as \\"J. Johnson\\". It also indicates that she carried two 9-pounder guns and ten short 9-pounders \\"on the New Construction\\". Britannia sailed from London on 21 January 1801 for Madeira and India. In Portsmouth her captain was relieved by Captain Stout. Benjamin Stout had received a letter of marque for Britannia two days earlier. Stout left Calcutta 28 October 1801. Homeward bound, Britannia was at Kedgeree on 4 January 1802, the Cape of Good Hope on 7 February, and St Helena on 26 March, arriving at The Downs on 29 May. She returned to London on 31 May2. In 1802 Captain J. Reddy replaced Stout, though her master had still been listed as J. Johnson.Lloyd's Register (1802). Captain James Reddy, of Britannia was reported to have died in Bengal on 29 August 1803.The Gentleman's magazine, 1804, Vol. 74, Part 1, p.181. Fate Contradictorily, another report has Britannia still under Reddy's command between 1808 and 1810, with Cleland & Co. employing her on the South Sea whale fishery.Clayton (2014), p.77. Supporting evidence is thin. A database of whaling voyages does not include Britannia. Jones, A.G. E.; Dale Chatwin; and Rhys Richards. BSWF Database ‚Äì voyages: Britannia. Lloyd's Register and the Register of Shipping for 1809 both still shows her trading on the India-London route, with Reddy as master. The 1810 Lloyd's Register shows Britannia, J. Reddy, master, and Cleland & Co., owners. Her trade is now London-South Seas.Lloyd's Register (1810), Seq. ‚ÑñB435. Britannia is no longer listed in the Register of Shipping after 1809, or in Lloyd's Register after 1810. Cultural depictions Britannias voyage as convict ship to New South Wales is depicted in the second episode of the Australian miniseries Against the Wind.

Major population centers include the city of Burlington and the villages of Mount Pleasant and Caledonia in Racine County, and the villages of Pleasant Prairie and Salem Lakes in Kenosha County. Boundaries As with all state senate and assembly seats, the boundaries of the 21st have moved over time during decennial redistricting. Senators of previous eras have represented different geographic areas. The district was created after the 1850 census and reapportionment and was drawn for Winnebago County, in central Wisconsin. The inaugural holder was Coles Bashford in the 6th session of the Wisconsin Legislature, 1853. In the 19th century, the district included at various times Marathon, Oconto, Shawano and Waupaca counties, and was located within the now-defunct 9th Congressional District For most of the 20th century, the district covered the city of Racine and Racine County, in southeastern Wisconsin, within the boundaries of the 1st Congressional District. In redistricting after the 2010 census, the city of Racine was mostly removed and rural and suburban portions of Kenosha County were added to the district, turning the 21st into a safe Republican seat. Recalls The 21st Senate district is unique in Wisconsin recall history. In 1996, it became the first district in which a Wisconsin state legislator was successfully removed from office via recall election, when Kimberly Plache defeated George Petak. With the recall of Van H. Wanggaard in 2012, it became the only Wisconsin district where there have been more than one successful recall elections. Current elected officials The district is currently represented by Republican Van H. Wanggaard. The area of the 21st Senate District contains three State Assembly Districts: * The 61st (represented by Samantha Kerkman) * The 62nd (represented by Robert Wittke) * The 63rd (represented by Robin Vos) The district is located within Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District, which is represented by U.S. Representative Bryan Steil. Past senators The 21st senate district has had several notable officeholders, including American Civil War General John Azor Kellogg and Wisconsin Governors Coles Bashford and Walter Samuel Goodland.

The 28 kilometre line is entirely single-track and non-electrified, but has been upgraded for the operation of tilting trains. Deutsche Bahn operates the line along with the T√ºbingen‚ÄìSigmaringen railway as the Zollernalbbahn (Zollernalb Railway). Historically, the line was often considered as part of the adjoining Allg√§u Railway, which opened at the same time. History Aulendorf station in 1900 Herbertingen station The Aulendorf‚ÄìBad Saulgau (then called Saulgau) section was opened on 25 July 1869 together with the adjacent Aulendorf‚ÄìWaldsee section of the Allg√§u Railway. The Saulgau‚ÄìHerbertingen section followed on 10 October 1869. Because Herbertingen station is poorly located for the town, Herbertingen Ort was opened closer to the town before the Second World War.

While making their way to Dracula's crypt, the group is ambushed by Dracula's vampires.Tomb of Dracula Vol. 4 #2 Following the vampire attack, Noah tells Blade that another part of Dracula's metamorphosis would have Dracula requiring a human woman so that there would be a new breed of daytime vampires.

In other media =Television= * Noah van Helsing appears in Marvel Anime: Blade voiced by Osamu Saka in the Japanese version and by Troy Baker in the English dub. In a flashback, it was shown that Noah van Helsing had his first encounter with Blade after he helped him save a girl from Baron Howard and his fellow vampires. The next day, Noah van Helsing discovered that Blade wasn't harmed by sunlight. Noah mentioned to Blade that he is a vampire hunter as Blade revealed that he has been having blood cravings. Blade mentioned that he has been looking for a vampire with four fangs. Noah van Helsing revealed a prototype of the Retro Virus made from the ashes of vampires which causes anyone in his experiments to turn to ashes. Noah decided to test the Retro Virus on Blade since his human DNA had found a way to co-exist with his vampire DNA. Noah stated that if it worked on Blade, he will have to decide what he would do with his second chance at life. The next day, it is shown that Blade had survived the Retro Virus with no blood cravings. Blade then asked for Noah van Helsing to train him how to fight vampires. In the present, Blade runs into Noah van Helsing and his dog Razor as Noah tells him that Deacon Frost is in the Philippines. They take a boat operated by Captain MacRae in order to get to the Philippines. When Makoto tries to attack Blade, Noah manages to knock down Makoto as Razor licks Makoto. Noah passes Makoto off as a boy. While on the ride to the Philippines, Noah gives Blade a medicine that would help with his condition. Later that night, Makoto tries to slay Blade in his sleep only for Blade to awaken and Noah to remove Makoto from the room. Noah explains to Makoto that Blade is a daywalker vampire and recaps his history with Blade. After Makoto learned of Blade's history, the boat is then attacked by a flock of Mandurugos led by Matthes. Although Blade fends of Matthes causing the Mandurugos to retreat, one of the Mandurugos snatches Noah at the last minute as Blade tells Captain MacRae to continue the course to the Philippines. Noah is then seen tied up in Matthes' mansion when Matthes gets word that Blade is at the slave ship docks. While Matthes leads the Mandurugos to go attack Blade, Makoto and Razor raid Matthes' mansion and rescues Noah. The next morning, Noah van Helsing thanks Blade for saving him and states that he is getting too old for vampire hunting. Noah tells Blade that he heard Matthes stating in a conversation that Deacon Frost has an underground hideout on a remote island. Noah tells Makoto to take Razor and help Blade fight Deacon Frost. In \\"Eternal Apocalypse,\\" it was revealed that Noah van Helsing was friends with a swordmaster named Tanba Yagyu who trained Blade and the mutant Kikyo Mikage in sword combat. In \\"Partner,\\" Noah van Helsing arrived in Cambodia to rescue Blade from the Existence facility that Blade is held in. When he finds that Makoto has been bitten by Deacon Frost, Noah stated that he didn't make it in time. After Makoto dies, Noah van Helsing accompanies Blade to the vampire city of Armarot (which is hidden deep within the Golden Triangle) in order to defeat Deacon Frost once and for all. During the battle, Noah van Helsing surveys the battlefield as he detonates the Existence's arsenal. Noah van Helsing and Razor then fight their way towards the blood source as he is targeted by the Mandurugos and the Manananggals until Razor saves him. Noah van Helsing then drops the water used by Agus into Armarot's blood supplies. Following the death of Deacon Frost and the destruction of Armarot, Noah van Helsing tells a truck driver that there is no sign of Blade. Razor barks at Blade's arrival as Noah van Helsing tells Blade that he knew Blade would come through. When Noah van Helsing asks Blade what he'll be doing now that Deacon Frost is gone, Blade vows to continue his quest of exterminating every vampire in the world.

Opened in 1970, it lost three anchors in the 2010s: Sears, JCPenney, and Macy's. It now features Ross Dress for Less and a Cinemark multiplex movie theater.Store Directory for Mall In October 2016 the Virginia Beach City Council rejected plans for an oceanfront arena. This vote triggered discussions for the Military Circle area to include the construction of a 20,000 seat multi purpose arena. However, rising city debt and other priorities appear to negate any near-term plans for a new arena to the area. History Military Circle Mall opened in 1970, developed by Harvey Lindsay Jr. Original tenants included J.B. Hunter (later Thalhimers), JCPenney, Smith & Welton, and Leggett (a division of Belk), a Sheraton hotel, and a 6-screen AMC Theatres multiplex. Thalhimer's became Hecht's in 1992, and Macy's in 2006. Smith & Welton closed in 1990. Renovations in 1996 included the addition of skylights in the concourses, new entrances and a 600-seat food court. AMC Theaters, located in the middle of the mall, closed in the mid-90s; a Cinemark multiplex opened a few years later in a different section of the mall. In 1998, Belk vacated the former Leggett building. A year later, then-owner Urban Retail began a renovation of the center, which included the addition of a Sears in the former Smith & Welton space, returning Sears to Norfolk after its previous store in the city closed in 1993. In 2000, an 18-screen Cinemark movie theater also opened on the site of the former Leggett/Belk. Thor Equities bought the mall in 2002 and renamed it The Gallery at Military Circle while continuing mall-wide renovation. Ross Dress for Less opened in 2004, taking space previously occupied by a McCrory dime store. A DoubleTree hotel, which had taken the former space of the Sheraton, closed about 2009 and has not reopened. KB Toys filed for bankruptcy and closed in 2009, followed soon by the closing of Suncoast, and Waldenbooks stores. Sears closed its Military Circle store in March 2012 as part of a nationwide series of closings. The JCPenney store at Military Circle was named as one of 33 stores JCPenney announced on January 15, 2014 would close later in the year. The Norfolk Economic Development Authority then bought the vacated anchor that December so the city would have a strategic say in the future of the mall property. The Macy's store closed in early 2016. On April 16, 2015; it was announced that the entire Gallery at Military Circle property was placed under foreclosure. On July 15, 2015, the entire mall property was put up for public auction in the Norfolk court. However, the mall did not change hands. On January 7, 2016; Macy's announced they were closing the Gallery at Military Circle location and many other locations as part of a massive restructuring; one of three in the Hampton Roads region and one of 40 overall closed in early 2016. Torchlight has hired The Woodmont Company to manage the mall with the intention of rehabilitating it and keeping it active. The mall at this time remains operational albeit with only the Cinemark theater as an active anchor. Current tenants In 2014, the City of Norfolk purchased the J.C.

Discovery and naming The holotype of Glaucidium kurochkini is LACM RLB K9630, a left tarsometatarsus. The paratypes are left and right tarsometatarsi, LACM(CIT) 155031 and LACM(CIT) 155032, respectively. All three specimens come from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California.

Kurochkin, ornithologist and paleornithologist from the Paleontological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, for his leading role in Russian ornithology and his many important contributions to the understanding of avian evolution. Distinguishing anatomical features G. kurochkini can be assigned to Glaucidium with certainty, because it shows the features distinguishing it from Aegolius, even if the two genera are almost identical. These features can distinguish G. kurochkini from all other Glaucidium species: a crista lateralis hypotarsi that is short, broad, robust, and projecting equally proximally and laterally; an eminentia intercotylaris that is long anteroposteriorly; the presence of a cotyla medialis with the rim, in anterior view, essentially even with side of shaft; a facies medialis that is wide proximally and lateral to the crista medialis hypotarsi; a sulcus extensorius that does not extend distally to the tuberositas medialis tibialis anticus; and a trochlea metatarsi II with an anterior medial edge relatively straight in anterior view.

Indigenous peoples of the Americas have used photography as a means of expressing their lives and communities from their own perspectives. Native photography stands in contrast to the ubiquitous photography of indigenous peoples by non-natives, which has often been criticized as being staged, exoticized, and romanticized. 1880s‚Äì1920s Benjamin Haldane (Tsimshian) with camera, Metlakatla, Alaska, ca. 1895‚Äì1905 Cherokee Female Seminary students stroll along boardwalk that led from school into Tahlequah, photograph by Jennie Ross Cobb (Cherokee), ca. 1902, collection of the Oklahoma Historical Society Curly (1859-1923), Crow survivor of the Battle of Little Big Horn, photo by Richard Throssel, ca 1907 Indigenous peoples of the Americas embraced photography in the 19th century.

Vargas (father of pin-up artist Alberto Vargas), was a successful Mestizo photographer in Arequipa, Peru, who taught photography to Mart√≠n Chambi (Quechua, 1891‚Äì1973), an Indigenous miner. Jennie Ross Cobb (1881‚Äì1959), Cherokee Nation of Park Hill, Oklahoma, began developing her own film as a young child and photographed her college classmates, family, neighbors, and students. The works of these early indigenous photographer stand in stark contrast to the romanticized images of non-native photographers. Recent scholarship by Mique‚Äôl Askren (Tsimshian- Tlingit) on the photographs of Benjamin A. Haldane has analyzed the functions that Haldane's photographs served for his community: as markers of success by having European-American-style formal portraits taken, and as markers of the continuity of potlaching and customary ceremonials by having photographs taken in ceremonial regalia. This second category is particularly significant because the use of the ceremonial regalia was against the law in Canada between 1885-1951. Native American boarding schools were important centers for photography at the turn of the century. John Leslie (Puyallup) learned photography at Carlisle Indian School. In 1895, Leslie published a book of his photography and exhibited his photographs at the 1895 Atlanta International ExpositionTurner, Laura. \\"John Nicholas Choate and the Production of Photography at the Carlisle Indian School.\\" Visualizing a Mission: Artifacts and Imagery of the Carlisle Indian School, 1879-1918.

The charges were later dropped, and he returned to Canada on 16 February 2012. Arrest and trials In 2011, al-Raas was working as an IT specialist in Kuwait. (al-Raas was born in Kuwait, but holds Canadian citizenship and lived from 1996 to 2000 in Ottawa.) In March, concerned by the growing unrest in Bahrain, al-Raas planned a three-week trip to visit his five sisters there and check on their safety. During his stay, he also attended an opposition rally, though he later stated in court that he had gone only to observe and had not participated. However, on 20 March 2011, while attempting to depart Bahrain via the Bahrain International Airport, he was seized by four plainclothes police officers. He later stated that he was taken to an underground cell in Al Qala Prison and tortured for a month by being made to stand for hours at a time and beaten with a rubber hose if he attempted to sleep. Police reportedly also staged a mock execution in which they blindfolded al-Raas and fired past him with rubber bullets. According to The Toronto Star, Doctors Without Borders later recorded medical evidence confirming al-Raas's reports that he was tortured while in custody. With his health steadily deteriorating, Al-Raas was released on 28 April 2011 to the hospital, after being forced to make a video confession that he was an Iranian spy. The police had confiscated his Canadian passport, and after leaving the hospital, al-Raas asked for its return. On 7 June 2011, he was asked to come to the police station to collect it, at which point he was arrested and allegedly beaten again. He was then charged with kidnapping and murdering a Bahraini police officer. The military National Safety Court found him not guilty of the charge on 4 October. However, al-Raas was then rearrested and named as a co-defendant in a separate case. He was tried alongside twelve other defendants for participation in the March rally, on charges of \\"inciting hatred towards the regime, participating in illegal gatherings and giving false information to the media\\". The thirteen were sentenced to five years' imprisonment apiece. Al-Raas was later critical of the Canadian government for observing his trial, but doing allegedly little to help him. Appeal and return to Canada On 24 January 2012, twelve of the thirteen defendants were acquitted by Bahrain's Third Superior Court. Al-Raas's sentence was the only one to be upheld. His fiancee, Zainab Ahmed, attributed to this to court sessions missed due to the declining health of al-Raas, who suffers from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and has previously had two open heart surgeries. On 25 January, al-Raas briefly went into hiding rather than turn himself over to authorities. He told an interviewer by phone that \\"My greatest fear is being tortured again ... I experienced it once before and it was like hell.\\" He was arrested on 1 February 2012 at a courthouse, after another hearing for his appeals case. He was then reportedly sent to Jaw Prison. All charges against al-Raas were formally dropped on 16 February 2012, and he returned to Canada. International response The Canadian government stated that it was \\"extremely disappointed\\" that al-Raas's appeal was denied, asking the Bahraini government to review the case to ensure \\"free political expression and protection from arbitrary detention\\". Amnesty International began a letter-writing campaign on al-Raas's behalf, calling for the charges against him to be dismissed and stating that the organization would designate him a prisoner of conscience if he were detained. Canadian activists also founded a grassroots organization, \\"Free Naser\\", on his behalf.

Lovelace covers her life from age 20 to 32. Directed by Oscar-winning duo Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, the film was written by Andy Bellin and stars Amanda Seyfried, Peter Sarsgaard, Sharon Stone, Adam Brody, James Franco, Chlo√´ Sevigny, and Juno Temple. Lovelace had its world premiere on January 22, 2013, at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and opened in a U.S. limited release on August 9, 2013. Plot In 1970, 20-year-old Linda Susan Boreman is living with her parents in Florida, having moved from New York. While out dancing one night with her best friend, Patsy, Linda attracts the attention of a man named Chuck Traynor and the two soon develop a relationship after a vulnerable Linda reveals to him that the relationship with her parents is strained. The strain was caused because Linda had earlier given birth to a son out-of-wedlock and her mother had tricked her into putting the baby up for adoption. Chuck, much older than Linda, begins teaching her how to perform sexual acts, which she is initially thrilled about. After breaking curfew one night, Linda is berated by her mother Dorothy; forcing Linda to move out so she can live with Chuck, later marrying him. During a party, Linda watches one of Chuck's homemade pornographic films for the first time and tells him that good girls never do things like that. Six months later, Linda bails Chuck out of jail for facilitating prostitution, although he claims to have had little knowledge of what went on in the parking lot behind his bar. Desperate for money, he persuades Linda to become a porn actress. By 1972, Linda begins working on a film, Deep Throat, in which she uses her new stage name \\"Linda Lovelace\\". The movie becomes a huge hit, making over $30,000 at the box office in its first week. After it becomes a worldwide phenomenon, Linda is interviewed by a variety of print and radio reporters, and becomes the subject of late night television humor. Her life is seen as exciting and glamorous, and Linda poses nude, and attends parties, weekly. During a private screening in Los Angeles, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner convinces Linda that she has the potential to be more than a porn actress. However, Chuck's violent and cruel nature is gradually exposed and Linda's life is revealed not to be as perfect as it seems. Chuck seemingly chokes Linda during sex, refusing to stop when she asks, and later forces her into prostitution at gunpoint. A battered Linda soon visits her parents seeking to move back in. Despite telling them of Chuck's dominating abuse towards her, Dorothy encourages Linda to embrace it. When learning that Linda has been discussing a new salary with the movie's director, Gerard Damiano, without telling him, an enraged Chuck punishes her by making Linda shower in freezing cold water. Years after Deep Throat's success, Chuck tries to persuade Linda to do another porn film. When Linda refuses, a now sadistic Chuck takes her to a party and forces Linda to participate in a gang bang. Her attempts to escape result in Chuck sleeping on top of Linda, almost suffocating her. The following day, Linda secretly meets with Anthony Romano, telling him she wants out of the porn business and also revealing the abuse she had inflicted on her by Chuck. Disgusted, Romano has her checked into a private hotel while he and his bodyguards attack Chuck for abusing Linda and for the $25,000 he owes. Six years later, Linda marries Larry Marchiano, moves to Long Island and has a young son. Linda later takes a polygraph test before publishing her autobiography Ordeal, which details years of Chuck's physical and sexual abuse, as well as his stealing all of her earnings. Linda appears on Donahue, and her distraught parents break down in tears while watching her. A few days later, the Marchianos travel to Florida for Linda to reconcile with her parents. Cast * Amanda Seyfried as Linda Lovelace * Peter Sarsgaard as Chuck Traynor * Sharon Stone as Dorothy Boreman * Robert Patrick as John Boreman * Juno Temple as Patsy * Chris Noth as Anthony Romano * Bobby Cannavale as Butchie Peraino * Hank Azaria as Gerry Damiano * Adam Brody as Harry Reems * Chlo√´ Sevigny as Feminist Journalist * James Franco as Hugh Hefner * Debi Mazar as Dolly * Wes Bentley as Thomas - Photographer * Eric Roberts as Nat Laurendi * David Gueriera as Larry Marchiano Production =Casting= In January 2011, pregnant Kate Hudson was offered the part of Linda Lovelace while James Franco was in talks to portray Lovelace's husband Chuck Traynor. The production of the film was planned to begin after the birth of Hudson's child and as of April 2011, the actress was still involved in the project. However, on November 1, 2011, Amanda Seyfried and Peter Sarsgaard were reported to be in discussions to play Lovelace and Traynor. Sharon Stone announced on November 16, 2011 that she would play Lovelace's mother. In December 2011, Juno Temple and Wes Bentley were cast as Lovelace's best friend and Larry Marchiano, her second husband. In December 2011, Franco received the part of Hugh Hefner. Robert Patrick, Hank Azaria, Chris Noth, and Bobby Cannavale landed the respective roles of John Boreman (Lovelace's father), Gerry Damiano, Anthony Romano and Butchie Peraino. On January 2, 2012, Adam Brody and Eric Roberts were cast as Harry Reems and Nat Laurendi, while Demi Moore agreed to a cameo appearance as Gloria Steinem. A few weeks later she dropped out of the film for personal issues and was replaced by Sarah Jessica Parker. However, Parker's cameo was ultimately deleted. Cory Hardrict and Debi Mazar play Frankie Crocker and Dolly Sharp. Chlo√´ Sevigny plays a feminist journalist. To prepare for the role, Seyfried read Lovelace's books and studied videos of her speaking. She also watched the film Deep Throat and underwent a New York accent training. Seyfried said of Lovelace: \\"She was such a different person than what we expect. It's a good story to tell, and I'm really, really excited about it.\\" Brody prepared for the role of Reems by watching his interviews. He told that \\"the arrest and indictment of Reems on federal charges of conspiracy to distribute obscenity across state lines\\" are not shown in the film. He described as \\"brotherly\\" the relationship Reems shares with Deep Throat co-star Lovelace, explaining that \\"he was the antithesis of her husband [Traynor]\\". =Filming= The Hollywood Reporter reported on January 13, 2012 that filming had already begun in Los Angeles. A few days later, photographs of Amanda Seyfried as Linda Lovelace on a film set were published. Scenes were shot in Glendale, California. Filming wrapped in February 2012. During the filming, the cooperation between Seyfried and Sarsgaard went so well that she called him with hindsight \\"the best actor I've ever worked with\\". =Post-production= Sarah Jessica Parker's scenes did not make it into the final version due to the time setting for the end of the film being changed from 1984 to 1980. As a result, the role of Gloria Steinem became unnecessary. Release The film premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2013. The film was released in the United States on August 9, 2013. Reception Lovelace was met with mixed reviews. According to Rotten Tomatoes, 53% of critics have given the film a positive review, based on 129 reviews with an average rating of 5.68/10. The website's critical consensus states: \\"Amanda Seyfried and Peter Sarsgaard do their best with the material, but Lovelace lacks enough depth and conviction to truly do its fascinating subject justice.\\" The film also has a Metacritic score of 51 out of 100, based on 37 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote the film was \\"smartly done\\". Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, commenting that it \\"never really feels triumphant or inspirational. It's very well-made and well-acted, but it's a reminder that the most famous porn star of the most famous porn movie ever made was a victim through and through.\\" On the other hand, Variety Rob Nelson complained the true story behind the film had been simplified to a \\"series of cartoonish vignettes\\". Amanda Mae Meyncke endorsed Seyfried's portrayal as \\"excellent\\" but considered the film all in all only \\"mediocre\\". Doubts were also raised as to the historical accuracy of the film's narrative.‚ÄúLovelace‚Äù ‚Äì by Gerard Damiano Jr., The Rialto Report, August 13, 2013 In particular, Gerard Damiano Jr., son of the director of Deep Throat, and Eric Danville, Linda Lovelace's biographer, spoke to The Rialto Report about how the film conflated spousal abuse with the treatment of actors in the adult film industry.Deep Throat: Damiano, Lovelace.. and ‚ÄúLovelace‚Äù, The Rialto Report, September 8, 2013 Music The soundtrack to Lovelace was released on September 9, 2013.

The group has toured Europe visiting cities like Berlin (playing at Lido), London (The Old Blue Last, The Dublin Castle), Manchester (Night & Day Cafe) and Paris (Le Motel). Sharing the stage with acts like Ghxst, Portugal. The Man and La Pegatina. The band has been featured in publications like The NME Magazine, Noiseloop, FIlter Magazine and Cuchara Sonica, where it was chosen as the best new underground band of 2010. On January 31, 2012, they were announced as part of the bill for the Festival Imperial alongside artists like Bj√∂rk, Manchester Orchestra and The Flaming Lips. They showcased at SXSW 2012 and 2014. In 2013 they played during Canadian Music Week and Filter Music's Culture Collide Festival in Los Angeles. In 2013 the released their third production, a 10-song LP titled In the Hour of the Wolf which was promoted during their second visit to SXSW in 2014. After several shows during that year they announced a hiatus, which lasted till late 2017 when they suddenly returned to the stage, now with Monserrat Vargas back in their lineup.  Biography  The initial lineup was formed in 2009 when Paola Rogue (vox, guitar) and Andrea San Gil (drums) decided to carry on after the split of their previous act, Lolita Pi√±ata. They were soon joined by Monserrat Vargas (bass), who had played with Paola in previous projects years back. After spending the first part of the year practicing and crafting songs, they started playing in several local venues such as El Cuartel, Latino Rock and El CENAC, amongst others. The group was joined by Jimena Torres as a second guitar in 2010. With their lineup finally complete, they set on to record and release their first EP titled Afterimages of Glowing Visions, a semi-conceptual work based on a post-apocalyptic dream that leads to the discovering of one's inner world. In November 2010, they revealed their second EP, Tiny Monsters, to the public. It is a 6-song album focused on topics such as claustrophobia, determinism and obsessiveness. After this release, the band has been featured in publications like The NME Magazine, Noiseloop and Cuchara Sonica, where it was chosen as the best new underground band of 2010. The band released a double single on April 15. The song is called ‚ÄúDark Horse‚Äù (parts 1 and 2) and it was also accompanied by a live video recorded by the production company S√ºrrealista at a show that took place in El Lobo Estepario. The single was available for download at their Bandcamp page. In September 2011 they embarked on their first European tour, which took them to countries such as France, Germany and the UK. During this tour they played along bands like Ghxst (USA), Portugal. The Man (USA) and La Pegatina (Spain), among others. Soon alter returning to Costa Rica, they participated in the compilation S√≠ San Jos√©, a project conceived by the North American producer Vito Petruzzelli (in collaboration with Daniel Ortu√±o and Adrian Poveda) which featured 9 bands of the Costa Rican indie scene. The compilation received acclaim both nationally and internationally. After completing the recording process for this project, Andrea San Gil left the band and was replaced by Alexandro Baviera, known for his work with bands like A Cry for Marie and Alphabetics. In December 2011, \\"Dark Horse\\" won the award for best song of 2011 given by renowned members of the Costa Rican press through the digital magazine 89decibeles. On that same month, they received an invitation to participate in North American festival SXSW, which took place during the month of March 2012. They showcased with bands like Cymbals Eat Guitars, A Classic Education and Ganglians. Their return home saw them play at the Imperial Festival along artists like Bj√∂rk, The Flaming Lips, Cage the Elephant, Manchester Orchestra and TV on the Radio among many others. The reviews of their performance were positive and the band started to gain a bigger following in Costa Rica. Sadly, they had to face the loss of founder and bassist, Monserrat Vargas, who decided to quit the band due to personal conflicts and her desire to focus on her other project, Las Robertas. The band quickly got back on their feet with substitute bassist, Gustavo Quiros, who helped them get through previous commitments and the recording of their first LP, In the Hour of the Wolf. This album was created with the help of Ronald Bustamante, Daniel Ortu√±o and Giancarlo Tassara of Mi√ºt Audio, San Jose. The tracks revolve around the theme of loss and recovery with a much heavier sound and an inclination towards bass and drum dynamics.

It is based on the US show of the same title and was originally hosted by Mike Meade from 1985 and 1990 and \\"co-hosted\\" by a robot named \\"Melvin\\" who was a Tomy Omnibot toy, and pitted individual children against each other. Melvin's uncle Morton (another Omnibot) had his own segment on the show entitled \\"Morton's Mouldy Movies\\", in which Morton would narrate stories in a grandfatherly voice accompanied by footage from silent film shorts. From 1991, the show was hosted by Sofie Formica, and ran as a week-long competition between two primary schools. The winning students in each episode would win individual prizes, and the overall winning school would win a larger prize, typically valued at around $2,000. In 1998, Becker Entertainment along with All American Fremantle International revived the show. Broadcast on the Nine Network, it was hosted by Scott MacRae and produced by Tony Ryan, with Bill Davidson as Executive Producer. In 2000 the show was replaced with another game show, titled Download, which was also hosted by McRae. Free games The host read a clue, and the answer was revealed one letter at a time, sometimes using one or more letters of the previous word. Letters were revealed until someone buzzed in and gave the correct answer and score or if only one letter was left in the word. Each subsequent word uses one or more letters of the previous word until that line is filled. The first player to guess five words correctly (seven in the 1998 revival) won the round and a prize package. Two line games are played and the winners of the line game play the Big Board round. Big Board The host read a question and the first player to buzz in guesses the line number. If correct he/she then gives the position number and the word. Players score based on the line number & position of the first letter. In the 1998 revival, points are doubled for the final 60 seconds of the game. The player with the most points when time runs out wins the game. Solo Round The solo round player needs to find seven words in 60 seconds with the help of the clues read by the host.

Bradford White Corporation is made up of Bradford White Water Heaters, Bradford White ‚Äì Canada, Laars Heating Systems, and Niles Steel Tank. Products The company produces various types of water heaters, including natural gas-, electric- (including high efficiency heat pump models), and propane models. The lineup includes some high-efficiency and Energy Star models. The company also offers a line of natural gas- and propane-powered tankless water heaters known as EverHot, as well as storage tanks for solar water heaters. In 2015, the EverHot series was replaced by the Infiniti series. Unlike the EverHot series which were rebranded Rinnai units, the Infiniti series was designed in-house by Bradford White and features an exclusive Scale Reduction Technology (SRT). Business model Bradford White has a longstanding business model where its water heaters are not sold directly to consumers; Bradford White water heaters are only sold to licensed plumbers at various supply houses. Bradford White claims this approach ensures proper and safe installation of its water heaters, and also prevents code violations. Awards In 2006, in a report by J.D.

The island is divided between two municipalities: R√∏d√∏y in the north and Lur√∏y in the south. The island of Nes√∏ya lies to the west, the island of Lur√∏ya lies to the south, and the mainland village of Tonnes lies to the east. The northern and eastern parts of the island are flat and marshy. The Arctic Circle crosses the northern part of the island. There are ferry connections to the surrounding islands and to the mainland at Jektvika. The tall mountain Hestmonkallen is located in the southwest. Name The name of the island has varied over time and not all have agreed on the name. In 2014, the appeal board for the Norwegian Language Council made a final decision on the name of the island. They decided that the main name of the island would be Storsels√∏ya and that name would also refer to the northern part of the island in R√∏d√∏y Municipality. Hestmona would be an official name that refers to the southern part of the island. The board also approved Sels√∏ya as an alternate name. A minority on the appeal board wanted Hestmann√∏y to refer to the southern part in Lur√∏y Municipality, but that was not approved. Historically, the island was known as Hestmona because of the main mountain on the island was known as Hestmonkallen.

Cases In 2011 he sat on the controversial case brought by ACS Law on behalf of MediaCAT, relating to file downloading on peer-to-peer filesharing networks. In 2012 he ruled on Temple Island v New English Teas, a case where a photograph of an AEC Routemaster London bus crossing Westminster Bridge was found sufficiently similar to another photograph of the subject to constitute copyright infringement. In July 2012, Birss, sitting in the High Court, ruled that Samsung did not infringe Apple's registered design right in the iPad designs. The judgment mirrored the decision made earlier in the US by a jury. In October 2012 the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment, including the publicity order imposed on Apple because it was necessary to clear up uncertainty in the market place after Apple took legal action in Germany against Samsung. The order required Apple to publicise that it had lost the case on its website and in the media. The Court of Appeal said, \\"because this case (and parallel cases in other countries) has generated much publicity, it will avoid confusion to say what this case is about and not about. It is not about whether Samsung copied Apple's iPad. Infringement of a registered design does not involve any question of whether there was copying: the issue is simply whether the accused design is too close to the registered design according to the test laid down in the law.\\" Personal life Sir Colin Birss lives with his wife and their three children at their family home in Hertfordshire.

He describes his starting style as influenced by the hip-hop underground scene. Between 2005 and 2006, he developed his style more commercially and over time his productions were increasingly based on a mix of tech house and dirty Dutch. Around the year 2008, his songs became slower and more commercial. In parallel, he experimented with elements from other genres. During that time, he came up already with build-ups, which were very similar to the big-room genre that had emerged years later. With the release of the single \\"Feel So High\\" in 2009, he published a tech-house song that corresponded to the classical progressive house, which was dying out, especially at the time. At the beginning of 2010, he joined the growing EDM genre and increased his talent in the area of production with singles like \\"Move It 2 the Drum\\" and \\"Asteroid\\". In 2011, his first successful singles in the field of electro house appeared with \\"Zero 76\\" and \\"Encoded\\". With \\"Spaceman\\", he co-founded the big-room scene in 2012 and established himself permanently in this subgenre.Tim Tabens: Top-10 der besten Big-Room-Tracks on \\"Dance-Charts\\" One year later, his singles \\"Apollo\\" and \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" gave him a place in the modern progressive house style. Hardwell in 2013 On his debut studio album, United We Are, he used trance music synths for the first time for his track \\"Echo\\" as well as deep house sounds for \\"Birds Fly\\". In addition, \\"Chameleon\\" is based on the jungle-terror genre, which was similar with the W&W; single \\"Get Down\\". For the first time since \\"Don't Stop the Madness\\", \\"Hollywood\\" embodies a track corresponded to the dirty-German-music. Starting from 2015, his syntheses were increasingly oriented on hardstyle samples. His Headhunterz collaboration \\"Nothing Can Hold Us Down\\" was created solely on hardstyle-based sounds. His solo productions \\"Run Wild\\" and \\"What We Need\\" contain features of this genre too. He also presented the song \\"Wake Up Call\\" at the Biggest Guestlist Festival in Mumbai, which was initially suspected as the collaboration with hardstyle producer Atmozfears, but later was confirmed by Hardwell as a solo production.Chameleon on \\"iaatm.de\\" His 2016 single \\"No Holding Back\\", represents his first movement into the UK garage. The track represents elements of deep and tech house scene as well for the first time since his Funkerman collaboration \\"Where Is Here Now\\".

Serine peptidase inhibitor, clade A member 2 belongs to the member of serine family of proteins which have a functional activity of inhibiting serine proteases.  Discovery  SERPINA2 was known as pseudogenes as it had a very similar structure and function to SERPINA1. During the cloning characterisation of alpha 1- antitrypsin like gene, it was discovered that SERPINA2 did not have any promoter but did contain substantial homology to SERPINA1 gene sequence.  Gene location  SERPINA2 is located at 14q32.13.  Gene expression and localisation  Extracellular predictions of SERPINs and common domain clades show that ER localisation of SERPINA2 are most likely be more, these common ER motifs indicates their localisation are most likely to be in the ER.  Structure  Population studies indicate that this gene is polymorphic. Deletions, frameshift mutations, and a critical start codon mutation (ATG to ATA) have been found in some populations, as well as an allele that can encode a functional protein. This gene may be an evolving pseudogene. The reference genome contains the start codon mutation and has a coding region deletion. A three-dimensional model of SERPINA2 was created using the non-deleted form of crystal structure, which is homologous with the SERPINA1 protein. The model was created using swissmodel in EXPASY, and has shown that SERPINA2 preserves a SERPIN reactive centre loop which is most compatible with protease inhibitory activity. The consensus sequence surrounding the reactive centre loop have diverged considerably so that now it contains tryptophan sarin motifs instead of the methionine serine motif.  Function  SERPINA2 was previously identified as pseudogene; however, recently there have been new evidence which specifies that SERPINA2 produces an active transcript that is responsible for encoding protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum. A detailed study of the SERPINA2 gene across multiple ethnic groups have relieved that with the addition of SERPINA2 gene therein a haplotype characterisation by partial deletion which has patterns suggesting positive selection of loss of function of SERPINA2 protein. SERPINA2 studies have shown different results regarding the extent of sequence degeneration it can undergo. Bao et al. (1988) describes in his studies that sequence with RNA splice sites are preserved in SERPINA2, and when expressed, it encodes a new secretory protein (SERPIN) with different substrate specificity. These studies with SERPINA2 in humans have concluded that recent positive selection is favoured by the loss of SERPINA2 function and pseudogenization. SERPINA2 genes are mostly expressed in leukocytes and testes which gives a residual expression in liver. SERPINA2 have been linked with on going adaptive process linked with advantages in the role of fertility and host pathogen interactions.  Mutations  A critical mutation present in the start codon and an 2kb deletion over exon IV and part of exon V. This deletion in the start codon occurs at a frequency of 30%. Studies with SERPINA2 in vitro and in vivo have shown that it expresses stable proteins with n-linked glycosylation with a molecular weight of 52kDa and compatible with regular SERPINs  Disease associated  SERPINA2 is a member of SERPIN family, which are known as protein coding genes. A disease associated with this gene is emphysema, due to aat protein deficiency. SERPINA2 has similar function to SERPINA1 and is related to the function of serine type peptidase inhibitor activity.
