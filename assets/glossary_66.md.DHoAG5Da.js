History and geography The railway line between Bologna and Florence (Direttissima) opened in 1934. Inside the railway there is a gallery which links the Apennines between Tuscany and Emilia Romagna, from Florence to Bologna, and it is situated between two train stations: Vernio-Montepiano-Cantagallo and San Benedetto Val di Sambro. The gallery is long. On January 12, 1920, the excavation for the construction of the great gallery at the entrance to the south began and on July 20, 1920 at the north entrance. The excavation was fast enough. The tunnel was completed on December 4, 1929. Working conditions The construction of the gallery involved workers from all over Italy and especially from Tuscan-Emilian countries where there was no work. The living conditions of the workers were very difficult: people went to work for the Bologna‚ÄìFlorence railway for necessity, but the work was very dangerous, tiring and not protected and the means of transport that brought to the work place did not exist. The work outside the tunnel consisted in working during the day and there was a break of one hour to eat. Inside the gallery, the workers had three continuous shifts of eight hours from morning to the evening. They worked on Sunday and had few holidays. The workers ate something quickly, sometimes in secret, between a job and the other. Team leaders were assigned the direct control of the work. The first teams were given the most dangerous phases: the temperature reached , the workers had to alternate every 5 minutes. The hard working conditions caused frequent incidents, the major causes were collapse and gas explosions or mine. In case of an incident, the workers were transported to the \\"ospedaletto\\" of Lagaro or to the Hospital \\"Mussolini\\" of Bologna. The conditions of the workers were not protected: the work was hard and it was easy to be fired, there was not a trade union to defend workers. The strike was not allowed. A positive aspect was that the workers had an insurance at work, and in case of illness, they had a minimum level of protection, but in case of serious injury, disability was recognized. Incidents During the construction of the tunnel, 99 men died while they were working on it. Many incidents were caused by gas release, the most abundant one occurred on August 3, 1928, and it caused a fire in a building site and the suspension of the excavations for almost six months. Some of these incidents were caused by violent penetration of water that could cause deadly damage: the most tragic of the water leakage occurred on 4 November 1927, work had to be suspended. The dead workers are remembered on two plaques affixed to the entrance of Prato station, so that they will not be forgotten.

Motown's owner, Berry Gordy was unhappy with the success of Ric-Tic and in 1968 paid $1 million for the signature of many of the label's artists. David Meikle interviewed Joanne in 2003 and established that the record label was named for the recently deceased son of label executive Bratton and her then husband Johnny Bratton, the boxer.

J. Barnes were re-released in the 1970s by Motown to coincide with the popularity of the Northern soul music scene in the UK. The group The Fantastic Four were also signed to the Ric-Tic, and became the label's best-selling act, outselling Edwin Starr in the United States.

It was written by Carl Carlton and Larry Campbell and recorded with contributions by nearly 50 musicians from all over the world. Amnesty International released \\"Toast to Freedom\\" on May 3, 2012.  History  Amnesty International concluded its 50th anniversary celebration with the release of \\"Toast to Freedom\\", an original commemorative song, performed by a selection of renowned artists. Written by guitarist/producers Carl Carlton (Robert Palmer, Eric Burdon, Keb Mo) and Larry Campbell (Levon Helm Band, Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello), \\"Toast to Freedom\\" is the brainchild of Carlton and longtime music industry executive, activist and entrepreneur Jochen Wilms. The two men worked in collaboration with Bill Shipsey, founder of Art for Amnesty, Amnesty's global project that engages musicians, actors and artists around the world to raise profile and funds for Amnesty International. The song's title is inspired by the story behind the 1961 founding of Amnesty International. British lawyer Peter Benenson claimed that his inspiration for Amnesty came while reading about two Portuguese students sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for raising their glasses in a toast to freedom at a Lisbon bar. In May 1961 Benenson launched the worldwide \\"Appeal for Amnesty 1961\\" campaign by publishing front-page article in the British newspaper The Observer. Reprinted in newspapers across the world, Benenson's call to action was the spark that ignited a fire of hope and inspiration in people around the world. It marked the beginning of what has become a global movement of more than 3 million supporters, members, and activists in more than 150 countries and territories worldwide.Richard Reoch (amnestyusa.org, February 26, 2005): \\"Peter Benenson Remembered: The man who decided it was time for a change\\"  Writing and recording process  Larry Campbell und Carl Carlton, January 2011 In the spring of 2011 Carlton and Campbell wrote the song within five days in a New York hotel. The basic tracks were recorded at the legendary Levon Helm Studios in Woodstock, N.Y, affectionately known as \\"the Barn\\". Internationally acclaimed musicians were assembled to record the song‚Äôs basic tracks. Additionally, the late Levon Helm corralled a number of his own friends, family members, and collaborators‚Äîincluding Steely Dan's Donald Fagen‚Äîwho were backed up by Carlton's band Carl Carlton & the Songdogs. Wilms also contacted producer/engineer Bob Clearmountain (The Who, Paul McCartney, Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen), who was impressed by the studio's sound and moved by the spirit and passion of the sessions. With the initial track completed, Wilms, Carlton and Campbell called together a diverse collection of voices from all corners of the globe, including Taj Mahal, Marianne Faithfull, Carly Simon, Kris Kristofferson and the actor Ewan McGregor to name but a few. The host of the recording sessions, The Band drummer Levon Helm, unfortunately did not experience the song's release. He died on April 19, 2012, after a longstanding illness. In a press release by Amnesty International on May 2, 2012, Wilms said about Helm: \\"Levon was one great soul. I am so grateful we got to work with him, his outstanding band and team in his barn in Woodstock. He was an inspiration and our muse. The song 'Toast To Freedom' is dedicated to Amnesty International, but in a certain way is now a 'Toast To Levon' and a celebration for him as well.\\" Bill Shipsey from Art for Amnesty said about Levon Helm: \\"On behalf of Amnesty International's millions of members around the world, I want to say how grateful we are to Levon Helm for his generous artistic contribution and support that will make a real difference to our life-saving work around the world. We in Amnesty owe him a huge debt. The best way to repay that debt to him is by continuing our work. Levon Helm created with 50 international musicians some musical magic for Amnesty. This happens when goodness and love combine with kindness and art to produce beauty and power leading to unarmed truth ‚Äì still the most powerful thing in the universe.\\"Scott Bernstein (Glidemagazine.com, 24. April 2012): \\"Love For Levon: Reactions to the Death of Levon Helm\\" Slated for release on Thursday, May 3, 2012 to coincide with World Press Freedom Day, \\"Toast to Freedom\\" is central to an innovative global campaign heralding the important human rights message behind Amnesty International. A dedicated \\"Toast to Freedom\\" website has been created, as well as social network pages on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube with links to the websites of Amnesty International and all contributing artists. \\"Toast to Freedom\\" is available for purchase via most online stores with proceeds benefiting Amnesty International. \\"Toast to Freedom\\" is available in a wide assortment of audio mixes, including Global Master Mixes for both the extended version and radio edit. It is scheduled to be available soon in regional specific remixes for South America, Africa, Australia, Asia, Europe and the USA.

Mai 2012): U2 News The song is also being played live in concert by musicians everywhere, including the song's co-writer, Carl Carlton, who has been performing it nightly while on tour with German rock icon Peter Maffay. Artists from all corners of the globe were on hand for \\"Electric Burma: A Concert for Aung San Suu Kyi\\", on Monday, June 18 at Dublin's Bord G√°is Energy Theatre.

The unique multi-artist rendition featured an all-star band led by the song‚Äôs writer and Electric Burma's Co-Musical-Director Carl Carlton, who said: \\"It will be a great honor perform 'Toast To Freedom' for Aung Saan Su Kyi. She stands for everything I believe in and fight and write for. She is not only a guiding light but a voice for every soul in this universe in the name of human rights.

Cover versions  Released May 3 to coincide with World Press Freedom Day, \\"Toast To Freedom\\" has since been reinterpreted by a remarkable range of artists. \\"I am surprised how many professional and semi-professional musicians have contacted me to see if they could produce cover versions to become part of this special initiative,\\" said Jochen Wilms. \\"Musicians from many different backgrounds are connecting with 'Toast To Freedom'.\\" Among them is Russian rap icon Basta, whose version of the song ‚Äì dubbed \\"Svoboda\\" (\\"Freedom\\" in Russian) ‚Äì is currently becoming widespread in his native country. The nom de hip hop of popular Russian singer/composer/poet Vasilii Vakulenko, Basta created \\"Svoboda\\" by melting potent new lyrics with samples from the original \\"Toast To Freedom\\" track. Joining Basta on the song is an array of famous Russian musicians, including rapper Smoky Mo, singer Tati, rapper Slovetsky, and singer/songwriter Billy Novik from Billy's Band. \\"Svoboda\\" was executive produced by renowned Russian music journalist Boris Barabanov in collaboration with Bill Shipsey, who noted: \\"There is a hunger for freedom and human rights in Russia that is palpable, more urgent and 'real' than anything we can know or feel.\\" An additional version of \\"Toast To Freedom\\" was recorded ‚Äì both audio and video formats ‚Äì by the vocal collective of Pavel Artemiev, Jenia Lubich, and Russia's top a capella beatbox group, The Jukebox Trio, the group, which initially broadcast a live version of the song on the Channel One late night show, Evening Urgant. Meanwhile, students at Germany's Hochschule Osnabrueck gathered on Wednesday, May 16, for a communal performance of \\"Toast To Freedom\\" by the many visitors to the city's annual Osnabrueck Maiwoche celebration. Inspired by Osnabrueck journalist Heinz Rebellius and organized by Institut f√ºr Musik director Martin Behrens, the event saw hundreds of voices ringing out in the Osnabr√ºck town center und were recorded by the students, who added the voice of the citizen of Osnabrueck to their own version of \\"Toast To Freedom\\", which they had recorded in the studio of Osnabrueck's Institute for Music. The students arranged their version of \\"Toast To Freedom\\" as a contemporary dance song with a faster disco beat, a sampled and looped guitar hookline and with a wide array of local musicians. More than 110 vocal tracks were recorded, and additional performances of well known Osnabrueck musicians like Toscho Todorovic (Blues Company), Heaven (Die Angefahrenen Schulkinder) and the Osnabrueck Symphony Orchestra pay tribute to the multi-artist rendition of the original version. \\"Toast To Osnabrueck ‚Äì The Freedom City Mix\\" was released worldwide on Humans Rights Day, December 10, 2012, including a video.\\"Toast To Freedom - the Freedom City Mix\\" Carl Carlton, composer and lyricist for the original version of the song, also expressed admiration for the \\"Freedom City Mix\\" of his song: \\"Many versions of this song are currently spreading the spirit of Amnesty International throughout the world, and this makes me indescribably happy as a songwriter. The fact that the entire city of Osnabrueck joined in creating this version is something very special. You can see the enthusiasm in the video: the stage performers and audience members practically melt together as one ‚Äì that's how it should be!\\" City mayor Boris Pistorius noted that the song fits in perfectly with the history of Osnabrueck, whose town hall famously hosted the \\"Peace of Westphalia\\" in 1648. Treaties signed here put an end to the bloody Thirty Years' War. Since then, Osnabrueck has been known as the \\"Freedom City (Die Friedensstadt)\\". Pistorius added, \\"I am convinced that 'Toast to Freedom ‚Äì The Freedom City Mix' embodies the power of freedom, and now many people around the world will have a chance to hear that.\\" Coinciding with the release of \\"Toast to Freedom\\" in May 2012, Amnesty sponsored a competition encouraging musicians all over the world to enter their own musical interpretations and arrangements of this tune. Of the many entries received, \\"Toast to Freedom ‚Äì The Berlin Mix\\" by the young Berlin artist Luca,Luca Homepage was unanimously chosen by the judges as the winner. Inspired by Berlin's own struggles against tyranny, Luca succeeded in creating a moving arrangement of the Amnesty anthem. Accompanied only by sister Maria on cello and by unadorned acoustic guitar and fragmentary bass, Luca's \\"Toast to Freedom ‚Äì The Berlin Mix\\" delivers equal parts reality and rapture. Luca‚Äôs version was also a clear winner for songwriter Carlton: \\"The message of the original, which is about each individual's right to freedom and the protection of human rights around the world, is in Lucas‚Äô version transformed into a very personal one. In the original, we used many musicians to create a powerful and colorful sound, and to do justice to a multicultural understanding of rights and freedoms. By contrast, Lucas' version is fragile, sensitive, but at the same time it delivers a very concrete message. This is a young voice coming forward to make the point that the fight for freedom and human rights takes place in our very own back yards every day.\\" Executive producer Jochen M. Wilms says, \\"Luca's Berlin Mix adds a new and very personal dimension to the artistic initiative. She recorded it independently in Berlin and, together with Berlin cameraman Daniel Devecioglu and co-director Tom Richter, also produced her own video\\"Toast To Freedom - the Berlin Mix\\", feat. Luca \\\\- a truly impressive and moving professional production!\\"  References   External links  *amnesty.org *ToastToFreedom.org *facebook.com/ToastToFreedom *twitter.com/TTF_official *youtube.com/ToastToFreedom Category:Amnesty International Category:Songs about freedom Category:Charity singles Category:2012 singles Category:2012 songs ","title":"Toast to Freedom"},{"id":"35705043","text":"James Fenton (born 1949) is a British poet (in English), journalist and literary critic.

The building, a rare example of Romanesque Revival architecture in Amsterdam, has rijksmonument status. \\"Nieuwe Waalse Kerk, Keizersgracht 676\\", Het Grachtenhuis (Dutch)  Description  The architect, A.N. Godefroy, was a proponent of eclecticism, something that is evident from his design for the Nieuwe Waalse Kerk. The building is a mixture of various styles: neoclassical architecture (the stone facade with a rusticated base) and Romanesque Revival architecture (the small round recessed windows and the Lombard band along the edge of the roof). Godefroy also mixed traditional styles with techniques and materials that at that time were considered new and innovative. For instance, he designed folding chairs for the church that had a faux wood texture, but were actually made of cast iron. Godefroy also used cast iron for the columns supporting the galleries. The symmetrical facade has a base and tall, Romanesque arched windows. The facade is topped by five small towers. The facade was segmented using horizontal water tables and vertical lesenes.\\"Nieuwe Waalse Kerk\\", Archipedia (Dutch) Facade design by A.N. Godefroy The church hall is a rectangular space lined on both sides by galleries supported by cast-iron columns. The walls are decorated with pilasters and arched alcoves.

History  In the 17th and 18th centuries, the number of Huguenots in Amsterdam grew rapidly. The original French Calvinist church, the Waalse Kerk (\\"Walloon Church\\") on Oudezijds Achterburgwal canal, could no longer accommodate all those who came to attend services, so in 1719 the French Calvinist community opened a second church, known as the Nieuwe Waalse Kerk (\\"New Walloon Church\\") or Petite Eglise (French for \\"Small Church\\"), in a disused bell foundry on Prinsengracht canal, at the corner with Molenpad. The original Waalse Kerk came to be known as the Oude Waalse Kerk (\\"Old Walloon Church\\") to distinguish it from the new church. In 1808, the new church (as well as many other Walloon churches in the Netherlands) was shut down by royal decree. \\"Geschiedenis\\", Waalse Kerk Amsterdam (Dutch) In 1841, the Huguenots purchased a building at Keizersgracht 676. The house, which dated to 1671 and was designed by Adriaan Dortsman, was to be demolished and replaced with a new church building. Construction of the church did not begin until 1854, however. In 1856, the first church services were held in this Nieuwe Waalse Kerk. The church was originally illuminated using gas chandeliers. The use of gas was at that time was an innovative new way to light all the lamps at once. In 1861, a fire broke out in the Nieuwe Waalse Kerk, causing the roof to collapse. Most of the interior was lost, although the cast-iron folding chairs survived the fire. The church was subsequently restored under the supervision of the original architect, Godefroy. The building was repurposed in 1989 as the arts centre Artemis. An additional storey was added to the building for dance and music studios. As of 2012, the building is in use as the offices of an advertising production agency. In 2001 the building attained rijksmonument status.

Partial differential equations are mathematical models of things like stresses in a car's body, air flow around a wing, the shock wave in front of a supersonic airplane, quantum mechanical model of an atom, ocean waves, socio-economic models, digital image processing etc. The computer takes the known quantities such as pressure, temperature, air velocity, stress, and then uses the laws of physics to figure out what the rest of the quantities should be like a puzzle being fit together. Then, for example, the stresses in various parts of a car can be determined when that car hits a bump at 70 miles per hour. The Kansa Method can be explained by an analogy to a basketball court with many light bulbs suspended all across the ceiling. If the brightness of each bulb can be individually adjusted, any desired light intensity pattern at every x, y point on the floor of the basketball court can be approximated. This light intensity pattern on the floor of the basketball court is the approximate solution to a partial differential equation. The Kansa Method is mathematically much easier to understand and program than the finite element method. It works very well when the number of variables exceed x,y,z, and time. E. J. Kansa in very early 1990s made the first attempt to extend radial basis function (RBF), which was then quite popular in scattered data processing and function approximation, to the solution of partial differential equations in the strong-form collocation formulation. His RBF collocation approach is inherently meshless, easy-to-program, and mathematically very simple to learn. Before long, this method is known as the Kansa method in academic community. Because the RBF uses the one-dimensional Euclidean distance variable irrespective of dimensionality, the Kansa method is independent of dimensionality and geometric complexity of problems of interest. The method is a domain-type numerical technique in the sense that the problem is discretized not only on the boundary to satisfy boundary conditions but also inside domain to satisfy governing equation. In contrast, there is another type of RBF numerical methods, called boundary-type RBF collocation method, such as the method of fundamental solution, boundary knot method, singular boundary method, boundary particle method, and regularized meshless method, in which the basis functions, also known as kernel function, satisfy the governing equation and are often fundamental solution or general solution of governing equation. Consequently, only boundary discretization is required. Since the RBF in the Kansa method does not necessarily satisfy the governing equation, one has more freedom to choose a RBF. The most popular RBF in the Kansa method is the multiquadric (MQ), which usually shows spectral accuracy if an appropriate shape parameter is chosen.  Description  The Kansa method, also called modified MQ scheme or MQ collocation method, originated from the well-known MQ interpolation. The efficiency and applicability of this method have been verified in a wide range of problems. Compared with the boundary-type RBF collocation methods, the Kansa method has wider applicability to problems whose fundamental and general solutions are not available, e.g., varying coefficient and nonlinear problems.  Formulation  Let d-dimensional physical domain \\\\Omega \\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^d and consider the following boundary value problem (BVP) : \\\\begin{align} Lu(X) & = f(X),\\\\quad X\\\\in \\\\Omega, & & (1) \\\\[4pt] u(X) & = g(X),\\\\quad X\\\\in\\\\partial\\\\Omega_D, & & (2) \\\\[4pt] \\\\frac{\\\\partial u(X)}{\\\\partial n} & = h(X),\\\\quad X\\\\in\\\\partial\\\\Omega_N, & & (3) \\\\end{align} where L represents a differential operator and d is the dimensionality of the problem, \\\\partial \\\\Omega_D,\\\\, \\\\partial \\\\Omega_N denote the Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries, respectively, and \\\\partial \\\\Omega_D \\\\cup \\\\partial \\\\Omega_N =\\\\partial \\\\Omega . The Kansa method approximates the desired function by a linear combination of the RBF in the form: : u(X)^{*} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\alpha_i\\\\varphi (r_i),\\\\qquad(4) where \\\\alpha_i is the coefficients to be determined, \\\\varphi(r_i) denotes the RBF such as the MQ. In order to guarantee the uniqueness of the solution, a polynomial term may be added as follows: : u(X)^{*} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\alpha_i\\\\varphi(r_i) + \\\\sum_{k=1}^M \\\\alpha_{k+N} \\\\gamma_k(X),\\\\qquad (5) where \\\\gamma_k(X) is the polynomial. The RBF interpolation (4) and (5) are both often used in practice. Mathematicians prefer the latter for its rigorous and solid theoretical foundation, while engineering users often employ the former since it is easier and simpler and produces the sound results in the majority of cases. Substituting Eq. (4) or (5) into Eqs. (1‚Äì3) yields the resulting algebraic equation system: : \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\alpha = b,\\\\qquad (6) where : \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} L(\\\\varphi) & L(\\\\gamma) \\\\[5pt] \\\\varphi & \\\\gamma \\\\[8pt] \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial n} & \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial\\\\gamma}{\\\\partial n}\\\\[8pt] \\\\gamma &0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right),\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{b}=\\\\left(\\\\begin{matrix} fgh0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right),\\\\quad \\\\varphi = \\\\varphi(x_i,x_j),\\\\quad \\\\gamma = \\\\gamma_k(X_i). \\\\qquad (7) After expansion coefficients \\\\alpha_i are evaluated, the desired function can be calculated from Eq. (4) or (5).  History and recent developments  Numerical solutions of PDEs are usually obtained through the finite difference method (FDM), the finite element method (FEM) or boundary element method (BEM). It is known that the FDM is difficult to model an irregular domain for the reason that it usually requires a rectangular grid system. Although the FEM can accommodate a more flexible framework, the meshing and remeshing are not trivial. The BEM is an alternative method in some engineering problems, such as inverse, unbounded domain, and thin-walled structure problems. However, its applications are largely limited by the availability of the fundamental solution of the governing equation. In the recent several decades, ‚Äúmeshless‚Äù or ‚Äúelement-free‚Äù methods attract great attention. The driving force behind the scene is that the mesh-based methods such as the standard FEM and BEM require prohibitively computational effort in handling high- dimensional, moving, and complex-shaped boundary problems. The Kansa method E. J. Kansa, \\"Multiquadrics‚ÄîA scattered data approximation scheme with applications to computational fluid-dynamics‚ÄîII solutions to parabolic, hyperbolic and elliptic partial differential equations,\\" Computers & Mathematics with Applications, vol. 19, pp. 147‚Äì161, 1990.J. Li, et al., \\"A comparison of efficiency and error convergence of multiquadric collocation method and finite element method,\\" Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements, vol. 27, pp. 251‚Äì257, 2003. directly collocates the RBFs, especially the MQ, at the nodes without the need of mesh or elements and therefore is an inherently truly meshless method. Despite great effort, the rigorous mathematical proof of the solvability of the Kansa method is still missing.Y. C. Hon and R. Schaback, \\"On unsymmetric collocation by radial basis functions,\\" Applied Mathematics and Computation, vol. 119, pp. 177‚Äì186, 2001. In addition, the mixed boundary conditions also destroy the symmetry of its interpolation matrix. Refs.C. Franke and R. Schaback, \\"Solving partial differential equations by collocation using radial basis functions,\\" Applied Mathematics and Computation, vol. 93, pp. 73‚Äì82, 1998.G. E. Fasshauer, \\"Solving Partial Differential Equations by Collocation,\\" 1996, p. 1. propose the symmetric Hermite RBF collocation scheme with sound mathematical analysis of solvability. One common issue in the Kansa method and symmetric Hermite method, however, is that the numerical solutions at nodes adjacent to boundary deteriorate by one to two orders of magnitude compared with those in central region. The PDE collocation on the boundary (PDECB) A. I. Fedoseyev, et al., \\"Improved multiquadric method for elliptic partial differential equations via PDE collocation on the boundary,\\" Computers & Mathematics with Applications, vol. 43, pp. 439‚Äì455, 2002. effectively remove this shortcoming. However, this strategy requires an additional set of nodes inside or outside of the domain adjacent to the boundary. The arbitrary placing of these additional nodes gives rise to troublesome issues in the simulation of complex and multiply- connected domain problems. The PDECB also lacks explicit theoretical endorsement. In fact, a similar strategy has also been proposed,X. Zhang, et al., \\"Meshless methods based on collocation with radial basis functions,\\" Computational Mechanics, vol. 26, pp. 333‚Äì343, 2000. which collocates both governing and boundary equations on the same boundary nodes. However, the method is unsymmetrical and still lacks explicit theoretical foundation. By using the Green second identity, the modified Kansa method W. Chen, \\"New RBF Collocation Methods and Kernel RBF with Applications: Meshfree Methods for Partial Differential Equations.\\" vol. 26, M. Griebel and M. A.

Tanaka, \\"New insights in boundary-only and domain-type RBF methods,\\" Arxiv preprint cs/0207017, 2002. is devised to remedy all weaknesses aforementioned. For the MQ, its shape parameter largely determines its interpolation error. There exist a number of mathematical theories concerning the family of multiquadric radial basis functions and providing some suggestions on the choice of the shape parameter.R. L. Hardy, \\"Multiquadric Equations of Topography and Other Irregular Surfaces,\\" J. Geophys. Res., vol. 76, pp. 1905‚Äì1915, 1971.R.

The Kansa method are widely been applied in computational sciences. In, the Kansa method is employed to address the parabolic, hyperbolic and elliptic partial differential equations.

He is known for his command of Spanish forces during the Battle of the Gebora. It is important to note that Mendiz√°bal rose through the ranks of the Spanish army, and was not of noble birth.  Military career  He began his military career as a sergeant major and saw his first action during the War of the Pyrenees. Throughout the war, Mendiz√°bal fought on both the Basque-Navarrese and Catalan fronts. In 1793, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel and was given command of a newly created regiment, the Voluntarios de Burgos posted in the north of Portugal. Due to the Spanish military disaster occurring at Ir√∫n at the end of the Battle of the Baztan Valley in 1794, he was transferred to western Gipuzkoa with the inferior rank of First Comandante by order of a military council.Censo Gu√≠a, The Spanish Secretary of State of Culture. On 2 December 1794, he commanded a joint √Ålavan, Gipuzkoan and Biscayan militia to achieve an unlikely victory in his own home town Bergara over French troops. In 1802, Mendiz√°bal was again promoted to the rank of Colonel, and was given the command of a regiment of volunteers from Navarre. On 23 September 1804, he entered the city of Bilbao at the head of his troops to put an end to a series of riots collectively known as the Zamacolada.biograf√≠a de Gabriel de Mendiz√°bal Iraeta MCN Biograf√≠as. In 1809, at the start of the Peninsular War, Mendiz√°bal was promoted to mariscal de campo, a rank equivalent to major general. Later that year, he was granted the noble title of a Count, officially \\"Conde de Cuadro de Alba de Tormes\\", for his military achievements against the French cavalry. In 1810, he continued his rise up the ladder and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General. He was named commander of the Army of the Left and suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of the Gebora after which he was kept from command. Utterly humiliated, Mendiz√°bal begged to serve as a simple rank and file soldier, a request that was granted. After distinguishing himself at the Battle of Albuera in May 1811, he was reinstated by the courts with the title of Commander of the Seventh Army or \\"S√©ptimo Ex√©rcito\\" which he took to the north of Spain in the territories that make up the Basque Provinces (Biscay), Navarre, La Rioja, Burgos, and Santander. He fought in this mountainous region using guerrilla tactics. On 16 December 1812, Mendiz√°bal was named political chief of the Seigneury of Biscay. He called the acting Council of Biscay, who in the wake of the approval of a new Constitution in C√°diz sent a task force to the city with a negotiation mandate. In the final phases of the war, on 31 August 1813, he controlled one of the divisions in the bloody but definitive Battle of San Marcial. For his actions, he was decorated with the highest military honors of the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand, and the Laureate of the Royal and Military Order of Saint Hermenegild.

They are the oldest rugby club in Denmark. History In 1947-48 after the Second World War a group of young Danes, who had served in the British Army learnt the rules of rugby. They met again in Copenhagen after their return and decided to start a rugby club that would take the name of ‚ÄúEx-Army‚Äù. Their rivals were mainly visiting teams from Great Britain and then the Police Rugby Club, formed in 1948‚Äì49 by Eigil Hemmert Lund, who also founded the DRU (Danish Rugby Union). During the first weeks 1949, the veteran soldiers did not meet as regularly as the previous years, however rugby garnered support from other locals who were interested in continuing playing, so all interested in continuing rugby in Denmark were invited to a meeting on 31 March 1949. A good mix of people were present that day, new players that wanted to become club members as well as a few of those former soldiers who wanted to keep on playing rugby.

It was opened in 1879 on the Main-Neckar Railway. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 4 station. History The station was opened in 1879 with the name of Buchschlag-Sprendlingen on the Main-Neckar Railway line. It opened up a forest district in the municipality of Mitteldick. In order to stimulate the development of the surrounding communities, it was decided on 1 April 1905 to build the Dreieich Railway (Dreieichbahn) between Buchschlag-Sprendlingen and Ober-Roden. Buchschlag-Sprendlingen station was renamed Dreieich-Buchschlag on 1 January 1977. Location  The station is located on the western edge of Buchschlag on Buchschlager Allee (continuing to the west as Wald am Mitteldicker Weg) on the Main-Neckar Railway, connecting Frankfurt and Heidelberg. Shortly south of the station, the Dreieich Railway branches off to R√∂dermark-Ober Roden. Connections  Today, the station is in the territory of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main Transport Association, RMV), with S-Bahn services operated by the Rhine-Main S-Bahn and regional services operated by Deutsche Bahn. In addition, it has two bus stops, a taxi stand and park and ride facility. Infrastructure  The entrance building of Dreieich- Buchschlag station has been sold off and now houses a restaurant. There is still a sign reading Buchschlag-Sprendlingen on the station building. Immediately next to the entrance building, there are 5 tracks passing over a level crossing over Buchschlager Allee. Since many trains pass over the crossing, the barriers sometimes remain closed for a long time. Public transport services =Rail= The station is served by the Rhine-Main S-Bahn and DB Regio services. S-Bahn lines S 3 and S 4 each stop at the station every half-hour on weekdays, which together provide services every 15-minute. On Sundays, both lines operate every hour, together providing a service every half-hour. The Regionalbahn RB 61 service (Dreieich Railway) runs from Monday to Friday three times in the morning from Dieburg to Frankfurt and three times in the afternoon from Frankfurt to Dieburg on the line, stopping in Dreieich- Buchschlag and Neu-Isenburg.Deutsche Bahn timetable =Bus = Some bus routes stop at the station, including city bus line OF-64.

The manga began serialization in the April 2008 issue of Kodansha's magazine Sh≈çnen Rival. Six tank≈çbon volumes have been released in Japan before the series was interrupted.  Plot  The world is infested with demons. They seek the perverse desires of man, take possession of things and people and eat their souls. Fighting them is the task entrusted to the Executive Committee of the Sacred White Lily; also known as the Apostles. Originally formed by Renga Takayama, Suou Kagayama, and Noshime Kinoshita, they are one day joined by mysterious new student Chitose Amakusa, who shares his body with a powerful demon with a black wing. In addition to driving out the demons in their region using the Holy Grail, the Apostles of the Committee must also protect the Holy Mother Moegi Takayama (younger sister of Renga and symbol of the descent of the Virgin Mary in the world) from their attacks. The goal of the demons is in fact eating the soul of the Holy Mother. Thich will allow them to open the Sin Place; the gate that connects the Earth to the Kingdom of the demons, so that they can come and go as they please from the human world. After defeating Sinclair, the Apostles must prevent the release of the Second Soul.  Characters  ; :The head of the Executive Committee of the Sacred White Lily, he's very protective of his younger sister Moegi and doesn't want anyone to touch her, especially Amakusa. When he thinks about her, his nose bleeds. His parents died ten years ago. To fight the demons, he uses the Takemikazuchi sword, which is broken during the final battle against Sinclair. With the help of Tou Inaba and Moegi, he reaches the Kingdom of the demons to free Amakusa from the control of the king of demons; here, during the battle, he discovers that his memories have been sealed when he was a kid: from what Renga partially remembers, he was one of Sinclair's student along with Amakusa and the two children opened the Sin Place using the Yohentenmoku. ; :The representative of the Executive Committee, on her back there's the stigma symbol of the descent of the Holy Mother. Her mother Asagi has filled that same role before her. Her blood is used to create the Holy Grail, which returns the demon in hell and saves the soul of the person possessed. She falls in love with Amakusa; she's naive and stubborn, but she always smiles. ; :A priest moved from Lourdes, his body is the home of a demon with a black wing, who eats the souls of demons rather than send them to hell. His teacher at Lourdes was Sinclair. He has a quiet nature, while the demon is strong, arrogant and quick. He made a pact with him: his enormous strength against the time he has to live. When it's not the demon in his body to fight other demons, he uses the \\"Stick with two wings\\": when idle, it takes the form of a little demon, connected to the soul of Amakusa, which reflects his emotions. Suddenly, the demon in his body takes over and reaches Sinclair: it turns out that the demon in the body of Amakusa is the king of demons, whose soul has been stolen and placed in Amakusa. Renga manages to get his friend back by inserting into his body the servant demon of the \\"Stick with the two wings\\", which contains a fragment of his soul. After his awakening, Amakusa stays in the kingdom of demons to fight Sinclair alone. ; :To fight demons he uses a flute. He's sarcastic; his older sister died five years ago after a demon ate her soul: for this reason, he nourished a deep hatred for them. ; :Fond of erotic games, she works with Suou and her job is sealing the demons with the Holy Grail. ; :Heir of the hospital complex Matsutouin and a doctor in the infirmary unit of the Institute, owned by her grandfather, she's the advisor of the Committee and report any orders from the top. ; :Apostle of the previous Holy Mother, is the ceramist who manufactured the Yohentenmoku. After the death of the former Holy Mother, he retired to live in the mountains of Kyoto with Kikyo and Fuji, his nieces. He spends his days getting drunk and playing pachinko. After meeting the Apostles, he decides to help them: with Renga and Moegi, he creates a temporary gate to the Kingdom of the demons to free Amakusa. ;Sanken of Fatima :She manages the Institute of the Sacred White Lily. Spokesman of the previous Holy Mother, she's the one who sealed the soul of the King of demons. Her name is just a pseudonym. Her soul is stolen to open the Sin Place, but she's then released by Amakusa. She reads the future in the Moon. ; :The teacher of Amakusa in Lourdes. Apostle of the previous Holy Mother, he sold his soul to the demons becoming an Apostle of the King of demons, and ten years before he tried to destroy God. Its goal is to get the seven souls needed to open the Sin Place, the gate of hell, in order to recover the body of the King of the demons and bring about its rebirth. He convinced Tou Inaba to forge the Yohentenmoku, a Holy Grail in the service of evil, built using the blood and the souls of seven Apostles. He can use any magical weapon without a contract. During the final battle, he's sealed by the Holy Grail. ; :Apostle of the King of demons, his job is to keep an eye on Tou Inaba. He uses the grasshoppers. After a bitter struggle, the Executive Committee, helped by Tou Inaba, manages to defeat him; however, he survives, but the King eats his soul.

They write and perform sketch and character comedy for stage and screen. History The group took their eponymous first show to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2006, only a month after their first live performance together at Dublin's Battle of the Axe comedy club. In 2007, they took \\"Diet of Worms on (Melted) Ice\\", a sketch comedy show performed in a swimming pool, to Edinburgh. They also began to release short mockumentary films online as part of a series entitled \\"Dublin Stories\\". The films were a collaboration with filmmakers Alex Gill and Michael Donnelly and were short portraits of odd Dublin characters, created and performed by one or more of the Worms at a time. This was later commissioned by RT√â to be developed into a half-hour pilot which RT√â aired in January 2009. Their 2008 live sketch show was entitled \\"Friends of the Puffincat\\". The show ran at the Gilded Balloon during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. It featured a character created by the group as part of \\"Adventures of the Puffincat\\", an online cartoon series they began producing in early 2008. The Puffincat is the apparent star of a faux- Russian children's propaganda cartoon. He is the result of the forced breeding of a puffin and a cat. In 2010, the group began releasing an online sitcom series called \\"The Taste of Home\\". It told the story of a Dublin family called the Walshes, through the lens of a primitive video camera operated by an unseen uncle. The series had five episodes and was set between 1987 and 1990. It was directed by Alex Gill and produced by Michael Donnelly. In 2010, the group moved from sketch to long form theatre. They presented the play \\"Strollinstown\\" at the Dublin Fringe Festival. The show was nominated for the Fishamble New Writing Award. In 2012, the story and characters were re-worked into a live radio production called \\"The Strollinstown Radio Hour\\" which was presented as part of the 10 Days in Dublin Festival. In 2011, they produced a play called \\"Cult\\" at the Lir Theatre in the Dublin Fringe Festival which the Irish Times called \\"sharp and self-aware\\". Irish Theatre Magazine called it \\"a highly amusing piece of theatre\\". In 2014 Diet of Worms produced a television series, The Walshes (based on their characters from Taste of Home) with Graham Linehan with BBC Television. It was broadcast on BBC Four and RT√â In 2016 the Diet of Worms wrote and performed a well-received television \\"playlet\\" called \\"Quints\\" for Sky Arts.

Maruthuvakudi's major attraction is the Ten Kurangaaduturai Temple, which is believed to be the place where Sugreeva worshiped Lord Shiva. This highly revered shivasthalam is one of two Kurangaaduturai temples in Aduthurai, located south of the Cauvery River. It is the sub urban region of business city of Kumbakonam. Origin of names Maruthuvakudi takes its name from the demon Maruthuvasura, who lived there according to legend. The name Aduthurai comes from the Tamil word ThenKurangaduthurai, which translates to \\"southern land where monkeys used to dance\\". The epic tales of Ramayana, in which monkeys play an important role, and especially the tales of Hanuman, may be linked to this name. Demographics As of the 2001 India census, Maruthuvakudi had a population of 11,455. Ten percent of the population was under six years of age. Males and females each constitute 50 percent of the population. Maruthuvakudi's literacy rate is 76 percent, considerably higher than the national average of 59.5 percent. Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute The Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute is located in Aduthurai. The research station was first established at Manganallur in 1912, and was shifted to Aduthurai in 1922. In 1962 it was renamed the Regional Research Institute. In 1981, after 19 years of successful operation, it changed its name again to Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute, or TRRI, and was elevated to Directorate of Rice Research Lead Centre in 1985. The institute occupies around 64 hectares and produces various high-quality breeds of rice and cane sugar. The institute's main focus is on promoting short-term cultivation. Some noteworthy breeds developed here are Aduthurai 32 (ADT-32) and Aduthurai 36 (ADT-36). Notable places near Aduthurai Many pilgrims visit the temples located near Aduthurai each year. Temples in the Aduthurai area include the Sooriyanaar Koil-sun, Thirumangalakudi-Mangambihai Oppliappan koil-Perumal, Swamimalai-Murugan, Thirunageswarar-Raghu, and Kanajanoor-sukran temples. The village name Viswanathapuram is named after Lord Viswanathar, one of the names of Shiva, and contains the Vishalatchi Amman temple. The connection by marriage between Viswanathar and Vishalatchi (another name for Shiva's consort Parvati) is treated as historical, and this site is locally considered parallel with the Kashi Vishwanath Temple and Vishalakshi Temple in Varanasi. A local saying expresses this: \\"Kaasiyin veesam viswanathapuram\\", that is, \\"One part of holy Varanasi is Viswanathapuram.\\" There are two rivers to the north of Aduthurai: the Veera Chozhan river and the Cauvery. The landscape of rivers, trees, and paddy fields around Viswanathapuram is typical of Thanjavur district.

The most famous and influential biography of Freud, the work was originally published in three volumes (first volume 1953, second volume 1955, third volume 1957) by Hogarth Press; a one-volume edition abridged by literary critics Lionel Trilling and Steven Marcus followed in 1961. When first published, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud was acclaimed, and sales exceeded expectations. Although the biography has retained its status as a classic, Jones has been criticized for presenting an overly favorable image of Freud. Jones has also been criticized for being biased in his treatment of rival psychoanalysts such as Otto Rank and S√°ndor Ferenczi. Summary Jones aims to \\"record the main facts of Freud's life\\" and \\"to try to relate his personality and the experiences of his life to the development of his ideas.\\" He criticizes previous biographies of Freud for their \\"distortions and untruths.\\" Subjects addressed include Freud's relationship with the physiologist Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow, and with the psychoanalysts S√°ndor Ferenczi and Otto Rank. Background and publication history According to the philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani, the events leading to the writing of The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud occurred as follows. Leon Shimkin, director of Simon & Schuster, contacted Jones in October 1946, to ask whether he was interested in writing a biography of Freud. Jones in turn contacted Sigmund Freud's daughter, the psychoanalyst Anna Freud. Jones had recently taken sides with the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein in her dispute with Anna Freud. Consequently, Anna Freud was unsure how much she could trust Jones, and suggested that he collaborate with her friend the psychologist Siegfried Bernfeld. However, Bernfeld was even more suspicious of Jones than Anna Freud was, and was working on his own biography of Freud. Nevertheless, Bernfeld was willing to work with Jones. After Jones displeased Anna Freud by writing a preface to Freud's The Question of Lay Analysis (1926) with which she disagreed, she asked the psychoanalyst Ernst Kris to inform Shimkin that she was considering withdrawing her agreement to Jones writing the book. Shimkin replied that Bernfeld should be entrusted with the task, with Anna Freud's assistance. Anna Freud did not wish to directly participate in writing the book, and therefore proposed instead that it should be written by Bernfeld and Kris. In September 1947, the publisher offered Jones a contract. Nothing followed from this until 1950, when Jones wrote to Bernfeld to ask for his collaboration, along the lines originally discussed. Bernfeld offered to place his research at Jones' disposal. He closely collaborated with Jones. Jones questioned Bernfeld on numerous matters, including Freud's date of birth, his essay on 'Screen memories', and his relations with the philosopher Franz Brentano and the psychiatrist Theodor Meynert. Bernfeld undertook research to help Jones and corrected the drafts of Jones' chapters. The psychoanalyst James Strachey also collaborated on the volume. Jones eventually gained the confidence of the Freud family, after showing the first chapters of the book to Anna Freud. In April 1952, the Freud family showed Jones the letters that Sigmund Freud and Martha Bernays wrote to each other during their engagement. Bernfeld, however, lost Anna Freud's support during this period, as she believed that his research tended towards sensationalism. She became so appalled at what she saw as Bernfeld's intrusions into private matters that she decided to stop replying to his requests for information. In discussing Freud's use of cocaine, Jones nevertheless relied on an article by Bernfeld. The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud was originally published in three volumes (first volume 1953, second volume 1955, third volume 1957) by Hogarth Press; a one-volume edition abridged by literary critics Lionel Trilling and Steven Marcus followed in 1961. Reception According to Borch-Jacobsen and Shamdasani, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud was acclaimed, and sales exceeded expectations, with 15,000 copies being sold in the first two weeks after publication in New York City alone. They state that the work was reviewed in periodicals such as the Manchester Guardian, which wrote that Jones had \\"drawn the portrait of a man who deserves to be acclaimed, by general consent, among the greatest of any age\\", while the psychologist Bruno Bettelheim adopted a more critical view of the work, accusing Jones of multiple \\"errors and omissions\\", and of lacking objectivity. Borch-Jacobsen and Shamdasani credit Bettelheim with being the first observer to point out that The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud relied on restricted documents and correspondence held by the Sigmund Freud Archives, making it impossible to determine its accuracy. Borch- Jacobsen and Shamdasani maintain that Jones provides a misleading account of Freud's experimentation with cocaine: according to them, Jones' statement that cocaine \\"had for some time helped\\" to control the symptoms of Fleischl- Marxow's withdrawal from morphine is \\"vague and misleading\\" and \\"aimed at explaining how Freud could have made false claims for success in his 1884 and 1885 articles.\\" They called the book \\"a brilliant dramatisation of the Freudian legend\\", writing that Jones \\"was past master in the art of utilising documents and accounts to which he alone had access to flesh out and confirm Freud's accounts whilst eliding the contradictions\\" and guilty of major omissions. Borch-Jacobsen and Shamdasani accused Jones of exaggerating the extent to which early reviews of Freud's works were negative, and of falsely portraying Freud as puritanical. Other critics of the book include the former psychoanalyst Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, the psychologist Hans Eysenck, the historian Roy Porter, the historian R. Andrew Paskauskas, and the author Richard Webster. Eysenck described the book as the \\"most famous\\" biography of Freud, but saw it as \\"more a mythology than a history\\", charging Jones with suppressing data which might reflect unfavourably on Freud. Porter described the work as \\"hagiographical and bowdlerized\\". Paskauskas criticized Jones for altering Freud's English in his use of his correspondence with Freud. He wrote that while Jones stated that he had not altered Freud's grammar, there are \\"many dissimilarities of spelling, grammar, and punctuation between the letters quoted in Jones's published biography and Freud's originals.\\" He accused Jones of errors in his citations of Freud's letters, such as mistakenly citing his letters to Freud as letters from Freud. Webster wrote that Jones was unreliable and replaced hostile accounts of Freud with an overly positive account. Mixed evaluations of the book include those of the psychologist Frank Sulloway, the historian of science Roger Smith, the psychologist Louis Breger, and the psychiatrist E. James Lieberman and the consultant Robert Kramer. Sulloway described the book as \\"monumental\\", writing that it had \\"deservedly remained the definitive and indispensable\\" biographical source about Freud. Nevertheless, he distanced himself from Jones' understanding of Freud, criticizing Jones for failing to admit that psychoanalysis owes its fundamental theoretical inspirations to biological sources. He also described the book as the \\"fullest expression of the Freud legend\\". Smith wrote that it is an \\"official biography, replaced in detail but still of interest\\". Breger considered the book biased due to its status as an official biography, as well as its author's active role in the psychoanalytic movement and hostility to other analysts, including Rank and Ferenczi. He nevertheless saw the book as valuable because of its \\"wealth of detailed, firsthand material\\". Lieberman and Kramer wrote that the book is the most influential biography of Freud. They also observed that Jones knew Freud for decades and had access to letters of Freud that were only published in full after 1990. However, they believed that Jones had a partisan view of his rivals Ferenczi and Rank. Positive evaluations of the book include those of the historian Peter Gay, the philosophers Jerome Neu and Richard Wollheim, and the sociologist Christopher Badcock. Gay described the book as \\"beautifully informed\\", and called it \\"the classic biography of Freud\\", adding that it \\"contains many astute judgments\\" despite Jones' poor style and tendency to \\"separate the man and the work.\\" Gay criticized the idea that Jones, motivated by jealousy, was scathing about rivals such as Ferenczi, maintaining that while exception has been taken to Jones' suggestion that in his last years Ferenczi was subject to psychotic episodes, it \\"echoes the opinion that Freud expressed in an unpublished letter to Jones.\\" Neu identified The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud and Gay's Freud: A Life for Our Time (1988) as the two most useful biographies of Freud. Wollheim called The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud a \\"great\\" biography, but observed that while Jones had the advantage of knowing Freud and his associates, he was able to write only what Anna Freud found acceptable. Wollheim observed that Jones alternated between discussion of Freud's life and discussion of his thought. In 1992, Badcock stated that despite the criticism it had received, the work \\"remains unrivalled and is the only biography to include summaries of all Freud's works known at the time of writing.\\" See also * Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire * Freud, Biologist of the Mind * Why Freud Was Wrong References =Bibliography= ;Books      * Category:1953 non-fiction books Category:1955 non-fiction books Category:1957 non-fiction books Category:1961 non-fiction books Category:Basic Books books Category:Books about Sigmund Freud Category:Books by Ernest Jones Category:English-language books ","title":"The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud"},{"id":"35705421","text":"Kaningi (Kaning'i) is a Bantu language spoken in Gabon.

In order to attain a safe river crossing, Hanuman worshipped a Shivalinga here, which he named as Dayanidheeswarar.

It is set in a miniature magical countryside and village area (Treetopolis) on the top of a part of a trunk of a big tree in a British-type woodland, where the trunk turns horizontal and then vertical again. Its characters are mostly anthropomorphised arthropods (which are not to size scale with each other as in reality). The programme is aimed at 2‚Äì6-year olds. 72 episodes were produced. In it, some species of insects are raised and controlled like cattle on a ranch: aphids, ladybirds, and a rhinoceros beetle. Premise In each episode, Tom comes out of his house, puts on a power belt, and runs across his lawn towards a crooked tree protected by a magic shield. Using the power belt, he performs some Tree Fu moves, jumps up, shrinks to insect size as he flies into the tree, and enters the world of Treetopolis. He is skilled in that world's magic, and often gets characters out of scrapes. Some of the characters are four of Tom's friends, Twigs, Squirmtum, Ariela, and Zigzoo. The tree's sap is shown as a glowing orange magic liquid. At least twice in each episode, Tom has to call on \\"the big world\\" for magical help: breaking the fourth wall, As a host, he asks his viewers to make magical moves and say magical words to assist him. The magical power is shown as an orange glow that appears offscreen and flies towards Tom, who uses it to complete the spell. The movements which the audience are called on to make are particularly beneficial for the development of children with developmental coordination disorder. The scenario includes magical hoverboards (called \\"leaf boards\\"), a sport called \\"Squizzle\\" and many sorts of cakes and snacks that the inhabitants of Treetopolis like to eat. At the end of each episode, Tom says goodbye to his friends and flies out of the tree's magic field. Back in the normal world, Tom flies up and says to his viewers as he gets back to the surface: \\"Thanks for helping me in Treetopolis. See you soon for another adventure! Bye, for now!\\" Tom runs out of the woods, across his back lawn, and in through his back door before the credits play. The series' two main voice actors each previously played major roles in Doctor Who: Sophie Aldred (who voices the animated Tom) as Seventh Doctor companion Ace and David Tennant (who voices Twigs) as the Tenth Doctor. The actor who plays Tom in the live action opening and closing sections of the show, Adam Henderson, is Sophie Aldred's son. The character of Twigs is currently given a voice by actor Mark Bonnar, who has also been in Doctor Who, playing Jimmy and his \\"ganger\\" duplicate in the two-parter The Rebel Flesh and The Almost People. Purpose The series was developed in conjunction with the Dyspraxia Foundation with the aim of promoting movement. Foundation specialists Sally Payne and Dr Lynda Foulder-Hughes worked with the series creators to develop the movements Tree Fu Tom uses to create magic. Five percent of children have developmental coordination disorder, and these movements are similar to those used by occupational therapists to help child development. It is also hoped that the spells will help get exercise into the lives of young children. Characters Tom (Thomas), the main character, and a host. He uses a magical belt to transport into Treetopolis and cast spells with help from the 'big world'. Though he is usually the best at spells, he is a modest character and often has to turn to his friends for advice when things go wrong. One of his catchphrases is \\"Tree Fu Go!\\" Thanks for your help!' where he shows his viewers how to do the 'big world' magic spell segment. He Is 8 years old. Voiced by Sophie Aldred, Lucien Dodge (US), live actor Adam Henderson, Vincent Tong and Elizabeth Waterworth-Santo.

Zigzoo, an eccentric tree frog who is the local inventor at Treetopolis, though not all of his inventions work out quite as well as he (or others) hope. Though it has never officially been confessed, certain episodes seem to suggest he may have a crush on Ariela. One of his catchphrases is \\"Oh Ribbety Roo\\" voiced by Tim Whitnall 2012‚Äì2015 David Holt 2016‚Äìxxxx. Squirmtum, a pill woodlouse who is a miner of sap in the caverns and general-purpose workman, and not the most intelligent of creatures. He can curl into a ball, and in that form he can roll fast.

Ariela, the alpha female character, a beautiful but feisty butterfly in charge of the Branch Ranch at Treetopolis, generally does not accept help from others, and likes to get her own way; but she is always there when her friends need her. She is highly competitive and rather impatient. She appears to have the closest relationship with Zigzoo ‚Äì who invents many gadgets for her ranch throughout the episodes. voiced by Samantha Dakin. Rickety McGlum, an elderly spider of Treetopolis; he used to be thought of as scary, but is now a close friend to Tom and his friends. He is also a Squizzle expert and trainer, and leader of the Tree Fu Rangers. He is also the grandfather of Racquette. Voiced by Tim Whitnall 2012‚Äì2015 Duncan Wisbey 2016‚Äìxxxx.

Sprites including Chezz, Bertie, Hazel, Lavender, Sweetpea and Goose throughout the first series, these were only background characters, but they began to make more frequent appearances in the latter series. Chezz In particular is a very arrogant, badge-obsessed conker sprite with rhoticism, who likes to show off. Despite having mild respect for Tom, Chezz is usually arguing or attempting to compete with Twigs ‚Äì often teasing him over his smaller size. Muru, enigmatic, Spanish, praying mantis introduced as part of the new 2016 cast, red magic teacher and friend of Tom. Has a magical stick that is able to rewind and fast forwards time. He uses an extension of tree fu magic (red magic) that allows the user to take on attributes of a big-world animal such as the speed of a cheetah or strength of an elephant. He uses a magic spell stone which has all the animal spells upon it. Voiced by David Holt. Racquette Troublesome female spiderling with a strong northern accent, and the granddaughter of Rickety. Although she loves and respects her granddad, she wishes he would allow her to adventure, believing him to be dull and overly cautious. She can be quite headstrong, though she usually realises when she makes a mistake. When bored or upset, she begins to spin webs in her hands. Spiders in this scenario appear to have a web spinning method similar to Spider-Man, where it comes from their wrists. Voiced by Sophie Aldred Rootle and Shade, shy brother and sister dark sprites that live in the deep root caverns. They were afraid that the light would turn them to jelly. Unlike the normal sprites, they lack wings and have snail shells on their heads. Their ears and eyes are much larger than those of the other sprites. Rootle has an odd impediment where he switches the first letters of characters names around (Twom and Tigs, Pink and Stuffy, though he does not do this with Shade).

Cambodia has an embassy in New Delhi, and India has an embassy in Phnom Penh. Relations between Cambodia and India goes back to ancient times. India's influence in Cambodia is visible from the Hindu-style temples of Angkor Wat to written Khmer, which is a derivative of the Pallava script from present-day southern India. Both nations are part of the Non-Aligned Movement. India established formal diplomatic relations with the Heng Samrin regime and opened its embassy in Phnom Penh in 1981 when Cambodia was internationally isolated. India had provided various personnel to conduct the UNTAC-sponsored elections in Cambodia in 1993. The Government of India agreed to preserve Angkor Wat temple when the Government of Cambodia appealed, between 1986 and 1993 and spent around 4 million dollars during this conservation. While Cambodia has historically aligned itself more with the People's Republic of China, India's greatest geopolitical rival, TheravƒÅda Buddhism is the official religion of Cambodia, practiced by around 95% of the Cambodian population, and its intrinsic Indian culture has considerably impacted Cambodian society and culture.

The former President of India, Pratibha Patil, visited Cambodia in 2010 on a state visit and asked the Indian diaspora in the country to, \\"be the bridge between the two countries to access knowledge, expertise, resources and markets for the development of the country of their origin\\".

The two countries signed four key agreement to enhance bilateral cooperation during the visit. The agreements include an MoU on the prevention of human trafficking, a mutual legal assistance treaty in criminal matters, a cultural exchange programme, and a $36.92 million line of credit from India to help develop the Stung Sva Hab water resource development project. India and Cambodia also agreed on facilitating exchanges between senior-level defence personnel and capacity- building projects, and also jointly endorsed the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).  Indian diaspora in Cambodia The first Indians in modern times to settle in Cambodia arrived in the 1960s and 1970s. Primarily coming from the northern province of Punjab, they worked as jewellers, moneylenders and traders around Central Market, but they left the country once the Khmer Rouge arrived. The Indians returned to Cambodia when Pol Pot‚Äôs regime collapsed. There is an Indian diaspora in Cambodia and they have established an Indian Association, Cambodia.http://www.iac- cambodia.org/cam_ind_relations.php References Further reading *Lokesh, Chandra, & International Academy of Indian Culture.

Code-switching with Sranan Tongo and Dutch was common among the younger generation in 1973, and about 70% of the tribe have moved to the urban areas. UNESCO considers the language endangered. In the 1970s, Jan English-Lueck collected a vocabulary of 500 words. Unlike the Ndyuka languages, the letter r is spoken in a similar way to Sranan Tongo and Dutch, although speakers without r have been discovered later. About three quarters of the words were cognate to Sranan Tongo, very few (circa 3%) were cognate to Matawai, and about 17% were not found in the other creoles and mainly originated from Dutch. The differences can be explained by education, because according to a 2011 study the population of Witagron had a good command of both Dutch and Sranan Tongo.

Henry Thorold describes the fine interior with its numerous altars, statues and lamps as \\"the kind of church that compels people to their knees\\". From its inception, the style and ethos reflects the Anglican Catholic tradition. The exterior of the church is also pleasing to the eye, with Virginia Creeper covering its walls and a well-kept and imaginative garden surrounding it.

It features the story of a mechanical draughtsman named Maurice Hilliard, who comes into some money, which enables him to live without working. As part of his resulting travels, he meets and falls in love with Eve Madeley, a book keeper. Eve's Ransom was published in a single-volume edition immediately after the conclusion of its serialisation, which was unusual at the time. The novel sold well, and a second edition soon followed, although critics were divided in their opinion of the work. Plot Maurice Hilliard is a mechanical draughtsman producing technical drawings on an annual income of ¬£100. He longs to be free from the monotony of his life and work, and is led by his feelings of hopelessness into drinking alcohol. While travelling by train one day, he meets Mr Dengate, a former debtor to his deceased father. As Dengate was bankrupt at the point of Hilliard's father's death, the debt was not repaid, but as they meet on the train, Hilliard shames Dengate into repaying the debt of ¬£436. Hilliard then commits to the plan of living without working, as a \\"free\\" human being, for as long as the money lasts. First travelling to London, and then to Paris, Hilliard eventually returns to his family home in Dudley, feeling lonely. He discovers a portrait of a young woman and decides to find her. Eventually, he succeeds in his plan. The woman, Eve Madeley, works as a book keeper, with an income of ¬£1 per week. Like Hilliard had previously done, she is despairing about her future. Eve tells Hilliard that they would not be able to marry, as his income is too small, but she does agree to travel to Paris with him. They are accompanied by Eve's friend Patty Ringrose. While in Paris, Hilliard falls in love with Eve. Background and publication Gissing wrote Eve's Ransom in a period of twenty-five days in 1894, finishing on 29 June. The work had been commissioned by C.K. Shorter to appear as a serial in the Illustrated London News, scheduled to begin in October 1894, although the actual publication was delayed due to difficulties in obtaining adequate illustrations. Shorter initially approached Fred Barnard, who had previously illustrated works by Charles Dickens, to illustrate the serial, but Gissing was not satisfied with the drawings Barnard produced. When Gissing went to discuss this with Barnard, he found that he was living in a state of drunkenness and poverty, unable to continue with the project. Another artist was chosen to replace Barnard, and the 13-part serial of Eve's Ransom eventually appeared in the Illustrated London News between January and March 1895. It was printed in a single volume by Lawrence and Bullen in April 1895. A second edition followed in the same month. It was unusual for serialised works to be published in their entirety immediately after their serialisation, and Gissing felt obliged to write a letter of apology to Shorter as a result. Reception Writing in the Saturday Review, H.G. Wells described Eve's Ransom as \\"remarkably well done\\". However, he criticised Gissing for not including \\"some flash of joy or humour\\" in the book and questioned whether, despite its apparent realism, it was \\"really representative of life\\". Wells suggested that this was a recurring issue with Gissing's novels, which reduced them \\"from the faithful representation of life to...the genre of nervous exhaustion\\". A reviewer in The Morning Post suggested that many readers would be \\"disappointed\\" by Eve's Ransom, due to its lack of human interest and its unsatisfying characters. The reviewer lamented the fact that Gissing had overlooked \\"elements of the human drama...and contented himself with writing merely a clever novel\\". The Manchester Guardian featured a more positive review, which suggested that, unlike Gissing's previous novels, it is \\"possessed of just that subtle power of arresting the attention and arousing the sympathies of the reader\\". The Bookman described it as a \\"strong and impressive story, and one that holds the attention of the reader to the end\\".

The street runs from Kottbusser Br√ºcke all the way to the Treptow Canal. Opposite it is the Maybach Ufer where the Turkish Market takes place on Tuesday, Friday and some Saturdays.  History  The street came into being with the creation of the Landwehr Canal, a parallel channel to the Spree river dug in 1845‚Äì1850. It was originally named Kottbusser Ufer until 1946 when it was named after Paul Lincke, the composer of operettas and songs such as \\"The Glow-Worm\\" and of the anthem of the city, \\"Berliner Luft\\". The street was part of the American Sector of West Berlin. It became part of the most important Turkish community in Berlin.

Notable people associated with the canal include Rosa Luxemburg, who was murdered and thrown into the canal. Notable buildings include at Paul-Linke-Ufer 20-22, a listed building from 1929, a former electricity substation designed by architect Hans Heinrich M√ºller.

It is located at a distance of approximately 297 light years from the Sun based on parallax. The system is drifting closer to the Sun with a radial velocity of ‚àí29 km/s, and in about three million years it is predicted to approach within . At that time, the star will become the brightest in the night sky, potentially reaching magnitude ‚àí0.88. The magnitude 5.66 primary component is an F-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of F2V. It is a Delta Scuti variable that varies by a few hundredths of a magnitude over roughly 16 hours. The star is an estimated 1.5 billion years old. It has a high rate of spin with a projected rotational velocity of 185 km/s, which is giving the star an equatorial bulge that is estimated to be 8% larger than the polar radius.

Life Esdaile began as a tutor in the family of James Christie of Durie. He then studied at the University of St Andrews. He was licensed by the presbytery of Kirkcaldy on 15 June 1803; and was ordained to Montrose, on 14 August 1805. He was admitted as minister in Perth in November 1810.Hew Scott, Donald Farquhar Macdonald, Fasti ecclesi√¶ scotican√¶; the succession of ministers in the Church of Scotland from the Reformation vol. 4 (1915) archive.org. Esdaile was awarded the degree of D.D. by the University of Edinburgh, 4 January 1838.A Catalogue of the Graduates in the Faculties of Arts, Divinity, and Law, Of the University of Edinburgh, Since Its Foundation (1858), p. 251; archive.org. He resigned his position 15 June 1844; and died 8 January 1854. Works Esdaile wrote the prominent article \\"Logic\\" in the Edinburgh Encyclop√¶dia, divided as Part I pneumatology, part II dialectics. Here \\"pneumatology\\" is what now would be called psychology, and was handled in line with the natural theology of the Enlightenment. It proved a source of controversy with Thomas Brown, whom Esdaile accused of plagiarism, based largely on the use of the term \\"Relationist\\".Remarks on Dr. Brown's Physiology of the Mind (1820) It also gave the author's opinion that Francis Bacon's influence on the advances of two centuries in natural philosophy was largely restricted to chemistry. Esdaile was considered a candidate for the Chair of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh in 1820, on Brown's death, at least in the eyes of some supporters of the Church of Scotland. In the event John Wilson was elected over the claims of Sir William Hamilton. Esdaile's theological works were: * Christian Theology: Or, A Connected View of the Scheme of Christianity (Edinburgh, 1823) * Apocrypha (Perthshire Bible Society, Perth, 1826); * Lectures on the Shorter Catechism (Perth, 1829). Two local controversies generated pamphlet wars: *A Letter to the Rev. W. A. Thomson: In Answer to His \\"Reply,\\" &c.;\\" (1826). Against William Aird Thomson (1773‚Äì1863) of the Middle Parish, Perth. **Dr. Thomson's two last letters to the editor of the Perthshire Courier, exposing the inconsistencies of Mr. Esdaile, and his doctrine of two standards of the Bible: with remarks on the conduct of the editor, and the notes of \\"a correspondent\\", respecting two standards of the pound weight and of the word of God (1829). *Debate with David Young of Perth, who was the junior minister in the North Church, in which Esdaile maintained the orthodox position in the Voluntary Controversy which ran in Scotland from 1829 to the Disruption of 1843: **Ecclesiastical establishments opposed alike to political equity and Christian law (1833, Young); **Civil and Religious Institutions necessarily and inseparably connected (Perth, 1833, Esdaile); **Reply to the Rev. James Esdaile's examination of the Rev. D. Young's pamphlet on ecclesiastical establishments (1833, Young); **The Voluntary Church Scheme without Foundation in Scripture, Reason, or Common Sense (Perth, 1834, Esdaile); **A vindication of scripture, reason and common sense in reply to the Rev. James Esdaile's second pamphlet on establishment (Young); **The Spirit, Principles, and Reasoning of the Voluntaries Exposed (Perth, 1834, Esdaile).

Antonio Papasso PAPIER froiss√© 1975-collection BNF folio n¬∞2-rhythm- of Re/spira (Breathe) 1982 etching in color-collection MoMA  Biography  Papasso was born in Florence in 1932, as the second son of Giovanni and Aldina Lollini and the brother of Giovanna. In 1939‚Äì1940, the family moved to Viareggio. After the war Papasso worked for an electric utility. In the second half of the 1950s, he set up an appliance store in Viareggio. His interest in painting started at the beginning of 1968. He then attended evening classes on art history and decided to become a painter. In 1970, he moved to Pisa and rented a farm-house, to work on action painting. He then met members of the new literary avant-garde Gruppo 63 and worked with Edoardo Sanguineti and . In 1971‚Äì1972, he decided to undergo a test inspired by the aphorism \\"I‚Äôve never seen colors fighting each other\\" by Picasso. He painted watercolors and figurative etchings, employing contrasting and harsh colors and signed them with the pseudonym of ANTIGONE. Some of these works are now in the collections of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France (BNF) ‚Äì Paris. Papasso became frustrated with his work and stopped painting after producing a collection of five etchings called Genealogia. In 1975, while he was printing Genealogia, he chanced on some crumpled paper (papier froiss√©). ...Papasso), starting from scratch, with a thin sheet of tissue paper crumpled repeatedly with the warmth of the hands, pursues a mode of germinal matter. He would like to add to his work the energy that erupts from its nature ... In 1978 the first papiers froiss√© were presented by Claudio Di Scalzo at Galleria 9 colonne in Trento. In 1979 they were exhibited and introduced by an essay by at Galleria Zarathustra in Milan and again in 1980 at the art gallery Greminger in Genoa. Alongside etchings and prints, Papasso continued to experience papiers froiss√©. In 1981 the historian Gillo Dorfles presented the last papiers froiss√©s in Milan at Galleria Zarathustra together with the collection of original prints entitled Sing, In the same year he moved to Anguillara Sabazia, on Lake Bracciano, in Rome's north area. In 1982 Papasso issued a collection of seven color etchings called Respira (Breath) (Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)) accompanied by a triple acrostic by Edoardo Sanguineti, with credits by Riccardo Barletta, Fausto Curi, Luigi Ferrarino and a letter by MoMA. In 1983 this work was acquired by MoMA. In 1983 the artist issued three color etchings called Storia (invecchiamento) written by Alfredo Giuliani. In the same year he produced six etchings Forma Naturae (Archetipi & C) with an essay by Giulio Carlo Argan. In 1986 he published the collection called Una \\"mina\\" nella memoria (A ‚Äúmine\\" in the memory) accompanied by the poem Videogramma volteggio (‚ÄúVideogram- vaulting\\") by Elio Filippo Accrocca. In 1989 he exhibited his works at the Charlton gallery in Rome with catalog presented for the second time by Gillo Dorfles. Later he exhibited his works of art at Toninelli-Arte-Moderna in Rome and in 1993 Foire Internationale d'art Contemporain (FIAC) held at the Grand Palais in Paris. In 1992 he published a collection of color etchings Promemoria-Pro/memoria accompanied by an essay by Edoardo Sanguineti. In 1999 he exhibited a retrospective entitled Il colore √® mio (The color is mine) in Bracciano. In 2004 Tommaso Lisa, member of the Italian Studies Department of the University of Florence, introduced Papasso in the book Pretesti Ecfrastici, collaborating with Sanguineti and other artists. In 2005 Papasso was invited to exhibit a retrospective of his works at the Museo d'Arte Contemporanea La Sapienza University of Rome. The exhibition was accompanied by an essay, Antonio Papasso ‚Äì il tutto e il niente (‚ÄúAntonio Papasso ‚Äì everything and nothing\\") edited by Claudio Di Scalzo. In 2006, Papasso was invited to exhibit all of his works from 1975 to 2006 at the Italian Air Force Museum (MUSAM ‚Äì Vigna di Valle) in Bracciano. The exhibition was accompanied by Papasso's essay, Elogio del leggero (In praise of lightness), together with an appendix and a movie directed by Riccardo Barletta.

The mausoleum is located in the centre of the middle yard of the Palace of the Shirvanshahs. Among local people it is known as the mausoleum of ‚Äúdervish‚Äù and was named after the philosopher and thinker Seyid Yahya Bakuvi who is buried in it. The mausoleum is not large. It has an octagonal prismatic form and is covered with a conic stone cupola. This form is odd for monuments of Baku and Absheron. Such kinds of constructions are met beyond Baku and partially in Shamakhi Rayon. The mausoleum is divided into two parts: overground and underground. The upper part of the mausoleum was used for accomplishment of cultic rites, but there was a burial vault. There are three small windows with stone shebeke-lattices in the southern, eastern and western facets of the mausoleum. The burial vault also has a window with shebeke- lattice. The whole mausoleum was revetted with narrow and wide rows of tightly urged to each other and finely nigged stones. Ancient ornaments in form of grid are saved within a cupola-shaped vault. Admixtures of wool fabrics strengthening the mausoleum were used in plastering of its walls. Light cuts (up to 3 mm) filled with colored mixture were made in plastering. The mausoleum was attached to an ancient mosque known as Key-Gubad Mosque. Seyid Yahya Bakuvi worked, prayed and taught namely in this mosque. The mosque was built during Shirvansah Key Gubad‚Äôs reign, in the 14th century, and was named after him. But in 1918, the mosque was burned down during a fire and only the remains of its foundation exist at present.

Biography The son of Esteben Malvicino, a railway employee, Horacio grew up in Concordia where, between and ages of 6 and 14, he was taught to play the guitar by Augustin Satalia. His teacher would only allow him to play classical music and in those days jazz was rarely heard in the city. However, he got to know the music of the jazz guitarists Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt and the jazz clarinetist Benny Goodman, by listening to a friend‚Äôs records of these musicians. He also listened to the tango music of √Åstor Piazzolla's Orquesta T√≠pica on Radio Splendid. Arriving in Buenos Aires in 1947, he studied medicine for five years until music took over his life and he became part of the bop generation centred on the Bop Club Argentino. This venue was frequented by the Argentine jazz tenor saxophonist Gato Barbieri, the Argentine pianist Lalo Schifrin and Rub√©n L√≥pez Furst. It was here that the first attempts to development modern jazz in Argentina were taking place in response to the great changes in the jazz world, initiated by the American jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker. By the time Piazzolla met Malvicino for the first time in 1954, improvising in the Bop Club, Malvicino had already played with several orquesta t√≠picas of the time including those of Fernando Roca, Eduardo Armani and Rene Cospito. In 1955 he joined Piazzolla‚Äôs Octeto Buenos Aires which would pioneer nuevo tango, a new approach to tango, until then dominated by the traditional orquesta t√≠picas of the 1930s and 1940s. This would mark a watershed in the history of tango and set Piazzolla on a collision course with the tango establishment. The jazz- like improvisations of Malvicino on electric guitar in, for example, Piazzolla's 1955 composition Marron y Azul, had never been heard before in tango. A long association with Piazzolla would see Malvicino join his first Quinteto in 1960, where he alternated with Oscar Lopez Ruiz, his Octeto Electronico in 1976, his second Quinteto in 1978 and his Sexteto Nuevo Tango in 1989. Malvicino travelled the world with Piazzolla and his ensembles and together they recorded 15 albums. Of the electric guitarists who played with Piazzolla, Malvicino was the one who he considered to best understood his music, and who was the most tanguero. From a young age, Malvicino has been an outstanding sight reader and arranger of music and has worked as musical director for the Argentine recording label, Disc Jockey, the international recording label RCA Records and for the Argentine television channel, Canal 11. During the 1960s he formed his own ensemble, the Horacio Malvicino Jazz Quintet. Over the years he has played various genres of music with many of the great names in the music world including Dizzy Gillespie, Gary Burton, Miles Davis, Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim, Joao Gilberto, Susana Rinaldi, Milva, Tanguito, Los Chalchaleros, Palito Ortega, and Pl√°cido Domingo. His has composed music for more than 90 Argentine films and theatrical works and in 1998 was awarded first prize by SADAIC for his film music. Nicknamed Malveta by his friends, he has worked under 15 pseudonyms including Alain Debray (Alain after the French actor Alain Delon and Debray after the French revolutionary R√©gis Debray) and Don Nadie (Don Nobody), typically when playing music outside the world of jazz. He married when he was 30 to Graciela and has two sons, Marcelo and Horacio. With a lifelong interest in horses inherited from his father, he runs his own stud farm, San Antonio, for the breeding race horses. Having never completed his medical studies as a young man he still maintains an interest in the subject and attends courses from time to time. In 2008 Malvicino published a book entitled El Tano y Yo, where he records stories of his musical career as electric guitarist in Piazzolla‚Äôs various ensembles, and is vice-president of the Argentine Interpreters Association.

He fought in the final wars against the Etruscans and later led armies in the Third Samnite War. He was appointed dictator in 263 BC with responsibility for overseeing the start of the Roman ship building effort in the First Punic War. Career A member of the plebeian, or lower class, gens Fulvia,Smith, p. 667 Centumalus is first mentioned in 302 BC as serving as a legate, an army commander, under the dictator Marcus Valerius Corvus in the war against the Etruscans.Broughton, p. 170 Elected consul in 298 BC, he and his colleague Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus were dispatched to deal with the Samnites following the outbreak of the Third Samnite War. The accounts of that year‚Äôs fighting, however, are contradictory. According to Livy,Livy, X:12 while Scipio was dispatched northward to battle the Etruscans, Fulvius was sent south to fight on the Samnite front. He defeated a Samnite army outside of Bovianum, after which he advanced to the town and captured it after a short siege. Centumalus followed this up with the capture of the town of Aufidena. Returning to Rome, the Senate awarded him a triumph.Arnold, p. 326 However, the Fasti Triumphales have him awarded triumphs for victories in both Samnium and Etruria, while Frontinus states he was fighting at Lucania. To complicate matters further, his colleague Scipio‚Äôs epitaph states that it was Scipio who won victories in Samnium, most likely during this year.Broughton, p. 174 According to the historian S. P. Oakley, Livy was probably confused about the theatre of war, and it was in fact Centumalus who won victories against the Sabines.Oakley, p. 32 In 295 BC, with the war still raging, Centumalus was one of a number of former consuls who were appointed propraetors, occupying the position as a privatus (a private citizen, or non-magistrate), and placed in charge of various armies.Oakley, p. 282 Centumalus and his legion were stationed on Faliscan territory, with orders to defend the passage along the Tiber River, and to keep communication lines open between the offensive armies and the capital.Oakley, p. 274Arnold, pp. 337‚Äì338 Problems in the field caused the consuls to issue orders to Centumalus to march with Lucius Postumius Megellus on Clusium as a tactic to force the Etruscans to withdraw their forces from Sentinum.Oakley, p. 292Broughton, p. 178 While Megellus was sent back to Rome, Centumalus invaded Etruria and proceeded to ravage the land. When the towns of Clusium and Perusia sent out an army to put a stop to his destructive tactics, he swiftly defeated their combined forces.Arnold, p. 345 After this, and a Roman victory at the decisive Battle of Sentinum, Centumalus was recalled to Rome where his army was disbanded.Arnold, p. 346 The final mention of Centumalus was his appointment in 263 BC as dictator. A dictator was given the full authority of the state for a limited period in order to deal with a military emergency or to undertake a specific duty. This was just after the outbreak of the First Punic War, and his task was to mobilise the resources of the state to bring about the creation of a navy, which the Romans would need to successfully take the war to Carthage.Broughton, p. 204Arnold, pp. 571‚Äì572 References and sources =References= =Ancient sources= * Livy, History of Rome =Modern sources= * Oakley, S.

The station is situated approximately north of Perth in the shire of Murchison. The property covers a total area of . The bulk of the land is Mulga scrub land and contains a -length of the Murchison river and the Roderick River as well as Lake Wooleen. It is bordered to the north by Meeberrie, to the east by Boolardy and to the south by Murgoo Station. Wooleen was first selected in 1887 and was owned by James Sharpe and David McWhinney in 1890, the station lost about 1,100 sheep as well as their shepherd from dehydration in the tremendous heat of February 1890 some west of the homestead. The shepherd's name was Templeton and he was found with a note describing his predicament. The district received good rains a few days later. Heavy rains fell in the area in 1921 with the local mail being stranded at Wooleen for some time as a result of washaways, nearby properties recorded falls of up to . A 12-stand shearing shed was built in 1922. Ben Sharpe who owned Wooleen Station also took up the lease at Mardie Station in 1923. Sharpe took delivery of a 15-hp Crossley, fitted with tray body to use as a station runabout, at Wooleen in 1924. Over 28,000 sheep were shorn at the station in 1924.

Educated primarily in England, where he lived from 1904 to 1920, Chanturia returned to his native Samegrelo to established the Dadiani Palaces Museum in Zugdidi.  Early life and education in England  Born in 1881, Chanturia attended a religious school in Senaki, a small town in Samegrelo. He could have entered the Tbilisi Theological Seminary, but instead decided to pursue his studies abroad. To achieve that goal, he moved to Batumi to work at the Rothschild factory, where he learned English and saved his pay to finance a trip to England. Chanturia moved to London in 1904, where he worked as a private teacher of Russian. At the same time he enrolled at university in the faculty of geology. He also studied archaeology, history, cartography, ethnography, museology, philology, art and folklore, and took part in scientific and artistic visits and excursions organised by the British Museum. Chanturia returned briefly to Georgia in 1912, where he collected a large amount of geological and paleontological material in Samegrelo. He used this material to complete his thesis, Geology of Georgia, published in 1919. Upon returning to England in 1913, he studied at King's College, where he received a Bachelor of Science, and at the Royal College of Art.  Return to Georgia  Chanturia returned to Georgia permanently in 1920, and settled in Senaki with his wife, an Englishwoman named Kate Walter Ball, whom he taught Georgian and Mingrelian. He often travelled to Tbilisi to work at the newly established Tbilisi State University, and at various museums and libraries. He declined an offer to work for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as his main goal was now the establishment of a museum in Samegrelo. This museum opened on 1 May 1921 in the Dadiani Palace in Zugdidi. Objects from the other mansions of the Dadiani family, and of the private collection of Prince Achille Murat-Dadiani, were transferred to the newly created museum. From 1937, Chanturia was persecuted by the Soviet authorities. In 1940, he was dismissed from the museum he had created. He died in Zugdidi on May 11, 1949.

The partnership was possible since both ARC-Aid and Elkem Solar are based in Kristiansand. ARC-Aid has also entered a partnership with Kvadraturen School(also in Kristiansand) which has an alternative energy department. Every year a teacher and some students from this department travel to Kenya to gain some practical experience on solar panel maintenance and installation. Elkem Solar later expanded its installation program and laid down solar panels in Kisumu Polytechnic a technical school located in Nyanza. The interaction of these four partners led to the identification of a need for a school specialising in Solar Energy Technology and Water Resources Management. Elkem Solar would provide technical assistance to the school, Kvadraturen and Kisumu Polytechnic would develop the curriculum for the school while ARC-Aid and ARC-Kenya would coordinate the efforts of the different organisations.

Unofficial minority languages such as Malagasy and Swahili are also present on the island with limited usage.

Anthropological Linguistics. 8 (9): 408-409. According to John Mugane, professor of African languages at Harvard University, there were extended time gaps ranging from 25 to 30 years throughout the 1900s, which lacked new academic information on the Comorian Languages. From the 1600s until the late 1990s, only two dozen publication have included the languages of the Comoros. Many academic publications have only been passing references in other language studies or the accounts of travelers. Historically and informally, Comorian was written using a variant of Arabic script, called the Ajami Script. When Comorian was first identified in the 1880s, there was much debate over whether Comorian was a variant of Swahili rather than a standalone language. But according to Martin Ottenheimer, a professor of anthropology at Kansas State University, grammatical and linguistic differences discovered by French linguists such as Charles Sacleux and Antoine Meillet, have affirmed the distinctiveness of Comorian as a separate language from Swahili. For example, although both languages share similar vocabularies, there is a consistent mutual unintelligibility between Swahili and Comorian. Upon independence from France in 1975, Comorian was sought as an official language, and a Latin-based orthography was demanded by the Comorian government. In particular, the both the government and the people of the Comoros sough for a writing system that was distinct from French, whilst resembling its nearby East African nations. Since the 1970s, attempts have been made by both the Comorian Government and the University of the Comoros Department of Modern Languages to standardize the Comorian Language and integrate Comorian into the education system alongside French and Arabic..The impact of language policy and practice on children‚Äôs learning: Evidence from Eastern and Southern Africa (PDF) (Report). UNICEF. p. 26. In 1976, two Latin-based orthographies were proposed by the country‚Äôs president, Ali Soilihi and the linguist Mohamed Ahmed-Chamang. In 1986, a Swahili-based orthography was proposed by Comorian linguist Moinaecha Cheikh. However, the past attempts to introduce a Comorian orthography has failed to gain popularity. Political, historical and ethnic tensions regarding the different dialects of Comorian have been responsible for the failed attempts to provide a written standard for Comorian.For example, the orthography proposed by Cheikh was widely unpopular as the writing system was more suited towards the Shingazidja dialect rather than the Shinzwani dialect. There has been significant debate over which variant of the Comorian language is considered as the national language. According to Martin- Luther University professor Iain Walker, this debate has been largely avoided in Comorian politics, which has contributed to an increasing sociolinguistic disunity between the speakers of each variant.A 1906 Comorian postage stamp in French. The Comoros was a colony of France at the time. = French = The French language is the second most spoken language in the Comoros. According to a 2018 report by the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, 216,174 people speak French in the Comoros or 25.97% of the population.Estimation des populations francophones dans le monde en 2018 (PDF) (in French). ODSEF. 2018. Retrieved 18 May 2020 The language emerged as a result of French colonisation in the Comoros, lasting from 1841 until independence in 1975. French is considered the language of government and commerce and is acquired through formal, non-Qur‚Äôanic education.After independence, the use of the French language was propagated during the administration of the pro-French president, Ahmed Abdallah. The Abdallah administration had reinforced the use of French in education and provided official, French names to the geopolitical areas of the Comoros.Internationally, the Comoros is recognised as a Francophone nation, and is a full member of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie. During the colonial period, French was the main language of instruction across society, including administration education and trade. Similar to Arabic, higher education is also dependent on French language ability with many Comorian students attending universities in France.Sellstr√∂m, Tor (2015-05-26). \\"Africa In the Indian Ocean. Islands Ebb and Flow\\". doi10.1163/9789004292499 . = Arabic = Although an official language, Arabic is a minority language in the Comoros Islands. Arabic functions as a liturgical language for the country‚Äôs dominant religion, Islam, with 95% of the population adhering to the Sunni Muslim faith. Despite being an official language, Arabic is not widely used in the Comoros and it is not reported as a first language (L1) amongst the population. Historically, Arabic was a language of commerce, used for trade in the Comoros for over fifteen hundred years. Arabic was first introduced as a result of increased Arabian maritime contact during the slave trade from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century. These influences had persisted with the spread of various Arabic publications such as Al Falaq in neighbouring Tanzania and the Comoros.This led to the emergence of Islam, and the creation of the Koranic School in the 16th Century which instructed children in the practices and beliefs of Islam and propagated the use of the Arabic language.Ottenheimer, M. (1971). Domoni: Formal Analysis And Ethnography Of A Comoro Island Community (Order No. 7120225). Available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. (302537456). From the 1970s, the use of Arabic gradually began to separate from religious purposes. The teaching of Arabic as a secular subject and at an advanced level started to gain popularity. Arabic languages skills came to be regarded as privilege in Comorian society. But, Arabic language use remains largely assigned to religious purposes. This is primarily due to the lasting importance of the Quranic School in the Comorian education system, existing in Comoros for more than four centuries. The Comoros participates in international delegations tied to promoting Arabic language use. Six Arabo-Islamic colleges and an Institute for Arabic Language were constructed with financial support from the World Islamic League and Kuwait. Similar to French, higher education in the Comoros is tied Arabic language usage, with many Comorian students receiving tertiary education in Arabic-speaking countries. The Comoros is also a member of the Arab League.  Minority Languages  = Malagasy = According to Ethnologue, Malagasy is a minority language spoken in the Comoros.Comoros at Ethnologue (22nd ed., 2019) A dialect of Malagasy called Shibushi is spoken by an estimated 39,000 people in the Comoros Islands. Traces of Malagasy speakers predominantly reside in the islands of Mayotte and Moheli manifesting as small populations of Malagasy-speaking villages The small Malagasy-speaking communities originated from the late 18th century to the early 19th century, with migrants from Madagascar settling in the Comoros. This was the result of the slave trades in Madagascar occurring at this time, as well as the periods of Malagasy rulers on the islands.The presence of the Malagasy language has also influenced the surrounding languages in the archipelago. For example, there is a variant of the Shimwali dialect in Moheli that heavily borrows Malagasy vocabulary. = Swahili = Historically, Swahili served as the lingua franca of the Comoros, used for trade with the Arabic Peninsula, the East African Coast. As a Bantu language, Swahili shares similarities with the Comorian language and is estimated to be spoken by 1% of the population.Waldburger, Daniela (2013). The Plurilingual Repertoire of the Comorian Community in Marseille: Remarks on Status and Function Based on Selected Sociolinguistic Biographies (PDF). pp. 262‚Äì263. Retrieved 25 May 2020. Much of the early history of the Comoros is written in Swahili, using the Arabic script. Many ancient Comorian poems and songs written in Swahili detail key historical events such as the slave trade, and the various battles between the Sultans who once ruled the Comoros. Swahili played a major role for the struggle for independence in the 1960s when Comorians living in Tanzania would support independence by broadcasting messages via radio in Comorian and Swahili to Comorians living in French-colonised Comoros. Kiunguja, a dialect of Swahili, is also spoken in the Comoros, particularly in Grande Comore Islands. This was the result of the migration to the Comoros from Zanzibar in Tanzania during the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution.  Uses  A tourist exit stamp of the Comoros in French In government and commerce, French is the most widely used language. Since colonisation, education in the Comoros largely modelled the French model where French was used as the language of instruction. A strict French monolingual policy was historically enforced for public schools. Arabic is largely confined to religious, Qur‚Äôanic Education and is introduced as early as the age of four or five In Comorian society, religious parents often insist on their children learning Arabic in Quranic Schools before learning French in the public school system.The national education policy has also reinforced the role of French and Arabic as languages of instruction from primary through tertiary education, while Comorian is permitted at the preschool level. French and Arabic are also featured on the Comorian Franc, the official currency of the Comoros. The language of media is predominantly French and Arabic. Newspapers are only published in two languages, as in the Arabic language Al Watany, and the independent, French language, l‚ÄôArchipel. On social media, French is the predominant language, with 100% of Comorians in 2014 reported to have used French as their language on Facebook\\"Citizen Engagement and Public Services in the Arab World: The Potential of Social Media\\" (PDF).

Retrieved 19 May 2020. alt= Historically, French colonial planters and government officials used French to write personal and place names. This has influenced the spelling of place names on maps in the Comoros, many streets using French signage. Each island also holds a French and a Comorian name. = The Language Situation = Outside of administration, education and commerce, French and Arabic are not widely spoken. Instead, Comorian is the most widely spoken language, confined largely to informal and oral purposes. This is because, during the French colonial period, Comorian language use was forbidden in schools as it was not considered a suitable medium of instruction. Under the French model of education, Comorian language use by students were often met with severe punishments. The use of Comorian is also restricted by the lack of stable writing form that has complicated Comorian language use in education. Despite the lack of written standard, Comorian is still used for administrative purposes to a limited extent. In October 1974, the French National Assembly passed a resolution, requiring that the referendum bill be published in both French and Comorian and the Arabic script was used for the Comorian documentation. Comorian is also becoming increasingly present in education, with many schools teaching grammar on the local Comorian dialects. In January 1978, the Comorian Government had reformed primary schools to cater to religious education in Arabic and nursery education in Comorian. Since 2009, there has been an ongoing debate in the Comorian Government for Comorian as a language of instruction alongside French and Arabic. Amongst the different variants of Comorian, the Shingazidja is considered the most commonly used dialect, due to the population of Grande Comore Island being the largest in the archipelago. Shingazidja was used for the 1974 French and Comorian language referendum bill. The preference towards Shingazidja however, has contributed to the growing language disunity amongst the Comorian variants.  Multilingualism  Multilingualism is prevalent in the Comoros with a diverse language repertoire.

The daily chapters, read by Andrew Sachs were also available as an audio download. The second and third series were published online, running from Monday 21 September 2009 and Monday 13 September 2010, respectively.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/corduroymansionsbyalexandermcca/ Episodic writing The concept for The Dog Who Came in from the Cold is based on Charles Dickens‚Äô episodic writing ‚Äì which were novels serialised through journals in weekly or monthly instalments, in the 1800s. Following a meeting with acclaimed San Francisco novelist Armistead Maupin, Alexander McCall Smith pursued this method of writing in 2004 with his novel 44 Scotland Street. The story was serialised in instalments every weekday through The Scotsman newspaper. As Corduroy Mansions and its successors was released online, readers had the opportunity to interact with each other and the author himself through online discussion boards. This was edited by the Daily Telegraph staff. The project is a collaboration between Telegraph Media Group, Little Brown and Polygon (the fiction imprint of Birlinn Ltd). Plot The story is set in a fictional housing unit in London nicknamed Corduroy Mansions, and details the lives of the inhabitants of the large Pimlico house and others. The main characters are Barbara Ragg, Basil Wickramsinghe, Berthea Snark, Caroline Jarvis, Dee Binder, Eddie French, Freddie de la Hay, Jenny Hedge, Jo Partlin, Marcia Light, Oedipus Snark, Terence Moongrove, and William French. The chapters for this book in The Telegraph ran from 21 Sept 2009 until 19 Dec 2009. Book three in the series, A Conspiracy of Friends, ran from 13 Sept 2010 until 17 Dec 2010.

In the described configuration, the system is designed according to the master slave principle and enables the operator to remotely control minimally invasive surgical instruments including force/torque feedback. The scenario is developed at the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics within the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The system consists of * Three to five MIRO robot arms at the operation table, * Minimally invasive instruments (MICA), * a HD Stereo endoscope, * surgical workstation with two force/torque reflecting input devices and stereo vision, and * a planning suite for the robotic setup. Besides the semi- autonomous motion compensation, the system exclusively is a telemanipulator at any time and the surgeon at the workstation has full control of the surgical instruments. To change instruments or to introduce the robot setup, and for safety reasons a surgical assistant is present in the operating room (OR).  MIRO robot arm  MIRO is a lightweight robot (mass: approx. 10 kg, i.e. 353 US oz) with an optimized design for surgical applications. * Payload approximately 3 kg * 7 degrees of freedom (DoF) * Joint-sided torque sensors * 3 kHz Cartesian control cycle In the minimally invasive setup MiroSurge, the MIRO arms are mounted directly to the side-rails of the operation table. As the robot has full 6 DoF motion capabilities, the trocar can be located almost arbitrary within the robot‚Äôs workspace. Due to the additional DoF (joint) of the robot, a nullspace (elbow) motion is possible during operation of the robot, which is utilized for collision avoidance.  MICA minimally invasive instrument  MICA (mass approx. 0,9 kg, i.e. 31.8 US oz) is a robotic instrument for minimally invasive surgery. * intra corporal universal joint (2DoF) * scissors, gripper, or a Maryland as a functional tip (1DoF) * Joint- sided 7DoF force/torque sensor for force feedback * 3 kHz position control cycle The instrument MICA is mounted directly to the hollow wrist of the robot MIRO, thus the lost 2DoF of motion due to the trocar in case of the minimally invasive setup MiroSurge are re-established, giving the surgeon full dexterity inside patient's body.  Surgical workstation  For manipulation, the surgeon sits in front of a user console, remotely located from the operation table. The console comprises * stereo vision of the site of operation on a HD- display and * two commercially available, fully actuated input devices Sigma.7 (master) with 7DoF of motion dedicated to the left and right hand of the surgeon. Thereby, the surgeon is able to guide e.g. two robotic instruments MICA (slave) by moving the hand-held input devices according to the desired motion. Visual and haptic feedback is provided to the surgeon by the HD- display in front of him and the force/torque reflecting input devices respectively.  Planning and registration  Concerning an optimized positioning of robotic components and patient in relation to workspace accessibility, research is done within the MiroSurge system concerning pre- operative planning as well as intra-operative registration.  Intended applications  MiroSurge as a system for minimally invasive surgery is intended to operate in the abdominal and thoracic region with two MIRO-robots carrying MICA-instruments and one robot for the stereo-endoscope. According to Tilo W√ºsthoff, the industrial designer at the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, one of the main purposes of this device is the robot-supported surgery on a beating heart.

Thereafter she spent her time sailing between France and the West Indies. In May 1791 she was under the command of sous-lieutenant de vaisseau d'Urvoy de Portzamparc, ferrying troops from Martinique back to Lorient.Fonds Marine, Vol. 1, p.28. From 4 February to 14 December 1792, Marsouin was under the command of lieutenant de port Guillaume-Marie Lemarant-Boissauveur.

It forms a range with the Duluth South Breakwater Inner Light to guide ships into the canal from Lake Superior. History The appropriation which paid for the initial construction of this light was made in 1870, with the intent to build a structure at the end of the Northern Pacific Railroad docks. Storm damage, however, delayed construction until 1872, by which point the canal had been dug. A wooden pyramidal tower was erected, initially equipped with a fifth- order Fresnel lens. An elevated walkway led back down the pier; a frame dwelling for the head keeper was constructed nearby, with the assistants required to look for lodging elsewhere in the city. This tower was first lit in 1874. The area is notoriously foggy, and an automated bell taken from the South Manitou Island Light‚Äîthe first in a long series of fog signals‚Äîwas installed in 1880. This was replaced by a pair of steam-powered whistles in 1885, housed in a newly constructed shelter on the breakwater. The noise from these whistles brought complaints from city residents, so a parabolic reflector mounted in a sawdust-filled box was installed in a successful effort to direct the sound out towards the lake. Fog signal operation, it may be noted, averaged 472 hours a year for the first ten years of operation; in 1895 the whistles blew for 1,048 hours, an average of over four hours a day over the eight-month season. In 1886 the lens was upgraded to a fourth-order Fresnel lens, and the characteristic changed from a red and white flash to a fixed red signal. The late 1890s reconstruction of the ship canal resulted in the replacement of this tower and the fog signal house with a single brick lighthouse containing both signals. This house, constructed of Cream City brick, was completed in 1901, and the new tower was first lit on September 1 of that year. This tower stood on the southeast corner of the rectangular building, and housed the lens retained from the old light; the fog whistles and their reflector were also moved from the old structure to the new. The latter were replaced in 1915 with locomotive whistles, and in 1921 with Type F diaphones, setting off another round of noise complaints, which led to the installation of a new sound reflector. The diaphones were replaced in 1968 with an electronic horn, but in 1976 a group styling itself TOOT (for \\"reTurn Our Old Tone\\") began a campaign to restore the fog signal. Horns from the Kewaunee Pierhead Light were obtained, and in 1995 the diaphones were put back in service, eliciting, of course, a new round of noise complaints, which led to restriction of the signal to daytime operation. The signal required a three-phase current supply for operation, and when this failed in 2005, the Coast Guard refused to pay for repairs; legal concerns led the city to refuse to pick up the tab, and the signal was dismantled the following year. The light, however, continues in service, displaying a fixed green light. The South Breakwater Outer Light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016 for its local significance in the themes of engineering, maritime history, and transportation. It was nominated for its association with federal efforts to establish nationwide navigational aids, and for being characteristic of early-20th-century harbor breakwater lights built around the Great Lakes.

In the first series, the author wrote a chapter a day, starting from 15 September 2008, and the series ran for 20 weeks, totalling 100 episodes. The daily chapters, read by Andrew Sachs, were also available as an audio download. The second and third series were published online, running from Monday 21 September 2009 and Monday 13 September 2010, respectively.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/corduroymansionsbyalexandermcca/ Episodic writing The concept for the Corduroy Mansions series is based on Charles Dickens‚Äô episodic writing, novels that were serialised through journals in weekly or monthly instalments, in the 1800s. Following a meeting with acclaimed San Francisco novelist Armistead Maupin, Alexander McCall Smith pursued this method of writing in 2004 with his novel 44 Scotland Street. The story was serialised in instalments every weekday through The Scotsman newspaper. As Corduroy Mansions and its successors was released online, readers had the opportunity to interact with each other and the author himself through online discussion boards. This was edited by the Daily Telegraph staff. The project is a collaboration between Telegraph Media Group, Little Brown and Polygon (the fiction imprint of Birlinn). Plot The story is set in a fictional housing unit in London nicknamed Corduroy Mansions, and details the lives of the inhabitants of the large Pimlico house and others. The main characters are Barbara Ragg, Basil Wickramsinghe, Berthea Snark, Caroline Jarvis, Dee Binder, Eddie French, Freddie de la Hay, Jenny Hedge, Jo Partlin, Marcia Light, Oedipus Snark, Terence Moongrove, and William French. The chapters for this book in The Telegraph ran from 13 September 2010 until 17 December 2010.

Arc publishes up to 16 new books of poetry every year.  Origins  Arc Publications began its life when Tony Ward took over the reins in 1969. Until then, it had been run by a writers' collective based in the Medway Towns and had little in terms of literary production. Tony Ward started then printing pamphlets and poetry collections by new poets writing in English, and in 1974 associated with the Arvon Foundation, moving to Todmorden. Arc left its Arvon base in Hebden Bridge and became independent not only in publishing but also printing its own titles as well as providing printing services for Anvil Press, Galloping Dog Press, Ferry Press, Spectacular Diseases and Trigram Press in the Lancashire/Yorkshire border town of Todmorden. The reasoning behind the choice of publications was to produce \\"what was important to poetry\\", despite personal choices or reception or their marketability. In 1993, Tony Ward built a new editorial board, reviving the press. The new co-editors were Michael Hulse and David Morley, who re-launched the press to include both a UK and an International series of poetry in English. In 1994, Angela Jarman joined the board, bringing with her the creation of Arc Music in 1998, with pre-press and marketing duties. In 1995, Jean Boase-Beier was appointed editor of the Translation series, publishing contemporary and past poetry from around the world in English translation, with sub-series including Visible Poets and Classics. In 1998, Michael Hulse left Arc, and John Kinsella replaced him in supervising the International series. In 2001, David Morley's duties were taken up by Jo Shapcott, who worked with Arc until 2006, when John W Clarke was appointed as editor of the UK series. Arc Publications today Arc currently publishes around 16 titles a year, with series including International, Music, Translation and UK & Ireland. The current team at Arc sees Tony Ward (General Editor), Angela Jarman (Director of Development), Jean Boase-Beier (Translations Editor), John W Clarke (UK and Ireland Editor) and John Kinsella (International Editor). They are aided by Sue Flynn (Administrative Assistant), who worked as a book finisher for Tony Ward when he was printing books for Arc and other independent presses, and Sarah Hymas (Marketing and Publicity) and a handful of interns, changing every year. Arc participated in the Poetry Parnassus project (part of the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad) with 19 of its poets in the UK to read. The launch event featured Simon Armitage, and three Arc poets - Kristiina Ehin, Zeyar Lynn and Alvin Pang.Poetry Parnassus Launch Event .Poetry Parnassus Official Site .

The title page of the issue gives the year as 1854 but it was published in 1855. The English ornithologist John Gould then included the silver-throated bushtit in his book The Birds of Asia and cited Moore's paper. Gould used Moore's specific name but a different genus to obtain the binomial name Mecistura glaucogularis. He specified the type locality as Shanghai. As Gould's work appeared in print in 1855 before the publication of the proceedings of the Zoological Society, under the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature Gould's publication has priority. The name glaucogularis combines the Latin glaucus \\"glaucous\\" and the New Latin gularis \\"throated\\".

Atmospheric tidal winds due to differential solar heating or due to gravitational lunar forcing move the ionospheric plasma against the geomagnetic field lines thus generating electric fields and currents just like a dynamo coil moving against magnetic field lines. That region is therefore called ionospheric dynamo region.Chapman , S.J. and J. Bartels, ‚ÄûGeomagnetism‚Äú , Clarendon Press, 1951 The magnetic manifestation of these electric currents on the ground can be observed during magnetospheric quiet conditions. They are called Sq-variations (S=solar; q=quiet) and L-variations (L=lunar) of the geomagnetic field. Additional electric currents are generated by the varying magnetospheric electric convection field. These are the DP1-currents (the auroral electrojets) and the polar DP2-currents. Akasofu, S.I., \\"Physics of Magnetospheric Substorms\\", Reidel, Dordrecht, 1977 Finally, a polar-ring current has been derived from the observations which depends on the polarity of the interplanetary magnetic field.Heppner, J.P., in Dyer, E.R. (ed), \\"Critical Problems of Magnetospheric Physics\\", Nat. Acad. Sci.,Washington, D.C., p. 107. 1972 These geomagnetic variations belong to the so-called external part of the geomagnetic field. Their amplitudes reach at most about 1% of the main internal geomagnetic field Bo. Atmospheric Electric Conductivity Radioactive material from the ground and galactic cosmic rays ionize a small fraction of the atmospheric gas within the lower and middle atmosphere and make the gas electrically conducting. Electrons quickly attach to neutral particles forming negative ions. The positive ions are mostly singly charged. The electric conductivity depends on the mobility of the ions . That mobility is proportional to the reciprocal air density. Thus, the electric conductivity increases almost exponentially with altitude. The ions move with the neutral gas making the conductivity isotropic.Viggiano, A.A., and F. Arnold, in Volland, H. (ed), \\"Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics\\", Vol. 1, p. 1, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1995 At heights between about 85 and 200 km however -the dynamo region-, solar X- and extreme ultraviolet radiation (XUV) is almost completely absorbed generating the ionospheric D-, E-, and F-layers. Here, the electrons are already bound to the geomagnetic field gyrating several times about these lines before they collide with the neutrals, while the positive ions still essentially move with the neutral gas. Thus, the electric conductivity becomes anisotropic. The conductivity parallel to an electric field E is called Pedersen conductivity. The conductivity orthogonal to E and the geomagnetic field Bo is the Hall conductivity. Ohmic losses and thus Joule heating occur when Pedersen currents flow. The component parallel to Bo still increases with altitude. Near the geomagnetic dip equator, a west-east directed electric field generates vertical Hall currents which cannot close. Therefore, a vertical polarization field builds up generating a horizontal Hall current which adds to the Pedersen current. Such enhancement is described by the Cowling conductivity. Pedersen and Hall conductivities reach maximum values near 120 to 140 km altitudes with numbers of about 1 mS/m during sunlit conditions. During the night, these numbers may decrease by a factor of ten or more. The values of these conductivities depend on local time, latitude, season and solar 11- year cycle. The height integrated conductivities become of the order of 50 S, or a total resistance of the dynamo region of about 1/50 = 0.02 Ohm during daytime conditions.Fejer, A.A., Rev. Geophys., 2, 275, 1964 In the auroral regions which lie between about 15¬∞ and 20¬∞ geomagnetic co-latitude and the corresponding latitudes in the southern hemisphere, precipitating high energy particles from the magnetosphere ionize the neutral gas, in particular at heights around 110 to 120 km, and increase the electric conductivity substantially. During magnetospheric disturbed conditions, this conductivity enhancement becomes much larger, and the auroral regions move equatorward. At heights above about 200 km, collisions between neutrals and plasma become rare so that both ions and electrons can only gyrate about the geomagnetic lines of force, or drift orthogonal to E and Bo. The parallel conductivity is so large that the geomagnetic lines of force become electric potential lines, and only electric fields orthogonal to Bo can exist (see magnetosphere). Atmospheric Tides Atmospheric tides are global-scale waves excited by regular solar differential heating (thermal tides) or by the gravitational tidal force of the moon (gravitational tides). The atmosphere behaves like a huge waveguide closed at the bottom (the Earth's surface) and open to space at the top. In such a waveguide an infinite number of atmospheric wave modes can be excited. Because the waveguide is imperfect, however, only modes of lowest degree with large horizontal and vertical scales can develop sufficiently well so that they can be filtered out from the meteorological noise. They are solutions of the Laplace equation Longuet-Higgins, M.S., \\"The eigenfunctions of Laplace's tidal equations over a sphere\\", Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.\\", London, A262, p. 511, 1968 and are called Hough functions. These can be approximated by a sum of spherical harmonics. Two kinds of wave modes exist: class 1 waves (sometimes called gravity waves), and class 2 waves (rotational waves). Class 2 waves owe their existence to the Coriolis effect and can only exist for periods larger than 12 hours. Tidal waves can be either internal (travelling waves) with positive eigenvalues (or equivalent depth) which have finite vertical wavelengths and can transport wave energy upward, or external (evanescent waves) with negative eigenvalues and infinitely large vertical wavelengths meaning that their phases remain constant with altitude. These external wave modes cannot transport wave energy, and their amplitudes decrease exponentially with height outside their source regions. Each mode is characterized by four numbers: the zonal wave number n, positive for class 1 waves and negative for class 2 waves (their meridional structures becoming increasingly complex with increasing number n), a meridional wave number m, the eigenvalue, and the period, in our case one solar or lunar day, respectively. The modes are labeled as (m, n). Even numbers of n correspond to waves symmetric with respect to the equator, and odd numbers corresponding to antisymmetric waves. At thermospheric heights, dissipation of atmospheric waves becomes significant so that at above about 150 km altitude, all wave modes gradually become external waves, and the Hough functions degenerate to spherical harmonics; e.g., mode (1, -2) develops to the spherical harmonic P11(Œ∏), mode (2, 2) becomes P22(Œ∏), with Œ∏ the co-latitude, etc.Volland, H., \\"Atmospheric Tidal and Planetary Waves\\", Kluwer Publ., Dordrecht, 1988 =Migrating Solar Tides= The fundamental solar diurnal tidal mode that optimally matches the solar heat input configuration and thus is most strongly excited is the (1, -2) - mode. It depends on local time and travels westward with the Sun. It is an external mode of class 2. Its maximum pressure amplitude on the ground is about 60 hPa.Chapman, S., and R.S. Lindzen, \\"Atmospheric Tides\\", Kluwer Dordrecht, 1970 Within the thermosphere, however, it becomes the predominant mode, reaching temperature amplitudes at the exosphere of at least 140 K and horizontal winds of the order of 100 m/s and more increasing with geomagnetic activity.Kohl, H. and J.W. King, J. Atm. Terr. Phys., 29,1045, 1967 The largest solar semidiurnal wave is mode (2, 2) with maximum pressure amplitudes near the ground of 120 hPa. It is an internal class 1 wave. Its amplitude increases with altitude. Although its solar excitation is half of that of mode (1, -2), its amplitude on the ground is larger by a factor of two. This indicates the effect of suppression of external waves, in this case by a factor of four. =Semidiurnal Lunar Tides= The dominant migrating lunar tide is the (2, 2) mode depending on lunar local time. Its maximum pressure amplitude near the ground is 6 Pa, which is far below the meteorological noise. Therefore, it is not simple to detect such a small signal. Because it is an internal waves, its amplitude increases with altitude, reaching values at 100 km height two orders of magnitude larger than on the ground. Electric Currents =Sq-Current= Morphology More than 100 geomagnetic observatories around the world measure regularly the variations of the earth's magnetic field. The daily variations during selected days of quiet geomagnetic activity are used to determine a monthly mean. From the horizontal component ŒîH of such data, one can derive a corresponding overhead equivalent electric sheet current system at dynamo layer heights of strength J = 2 ŒîH/Œº = 1.6 ŒîH with J (in milliAmpere/meter) the electric overhead sheet current, ŒîH (in nanoTesla) the observed horizontal component of the geomagnetic variation, and Œº the electric permeability of free space. One can determine the direction of the magnetic field with regard to the current by the simple rule of thumb: if the thumb of the right hand points into the direction of the current, the curved fingers give the direction of the associated magnetic field. One has to take into account that this relationship is not unique. In general, electric currents within ionosphere and magnetosphere are three-dimensional, and an infinite number of current configurations fits to the geomagnetic variations observed on the ground.Fukushima, N., Radio Sci., 6, 269, 1971 Magnetic measurement in space are necessary to obtain a realistic picture. Figure 1. Streamlines of equivalent ionospheric Sq current during equinox (1957 - 1969) at 12 UT separated into primary (a) and secondary (b) part. Between two streamlines flow 20 kA Malin, S.R.C., Phil Trans. R. Soc., London, Ser. A 274, 551,1973. Figure 1a shows current streamlines of an equivalent Sq current as seen from the sun at noon. This current configuration is fixed to the sun, while the earth rotates beneath it. A total current of about 140 kA flows within one daytime vortex. The rotating Sq current and the electrically conducting earth interior behave like a huge transformer with the dynamo region as the primary winding and the earth as the secondary winding. Since the Sq current varies with the basic period of one day, electric currents are induced within the earth's interior. The magnetic field of this secondary current is superimposed on the magnetic field of the primary Sq current. Methods to separate both components go back to Gauss. The amplitude of the secondary current is about 1/3 of that of the primary current and slightly shifted in phase. Figure 1b shows that secondary component. The ratio between sheet current and magnetic component given above has now simply the value one. The Sq current depends on season. The summer vortex is intensified compared with the winter vortex and reaches into the winter hemisphere. A longitudinal dependence of the Sq current exists which is related to the inclined dipole component of the internal magnetic field, but probably also to nonmigrating tidal waves from below.Forbes, J.M., at all., J. Geophys. Res., Space Physics, 113, 17, 2008 In the course of the 11-year solar cycle, the amplitude of Sq increases by a factor of more than two from sunspot minimum to sunspot maximum. Two thirds of this increase may result from the enhancement of the electric conductivity with solar activity. The rest is probably due to the increase of the wind speed caused by the temperature increase with increasing solar activity. During the night, the electron density of the ionospheric E-layer diminishes much more strongly than that of the F-layer. Therefore, the height center of the dynamo region shifts upward.Matsushita, S., and W.H. Campell, W.H. (eds.), \\"Physics of Geomagnetic Phenomena\\", Vol. I and II, Academic Press, New York,1967 The main driver of the Sq current is the external (1, -2) tidal wave mode. Due to its constant phase with altitude, is most efficient to drive coherent winds at dynamo layer height,Kato, S., J. Geophys. Res., 71, 3211, 1966 while the currents generated by the internal modes interfere destructively at various heights.Forbes, J.M., J. Geophys.Res. 87, 5222, 1988 A Fourier analysis shows a semidiurnal component with an amplitude of 1 /2 of that of the diurnal component, phase shifted by 180¬∞. This appears to be the result of nonlinear coupling between the product of the diurnally varying wind and the diurnally varying conductivity .Volland, H., \\"Atmospheric Electrodynamics\\", Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1984 The centers of the daytime vortices show a day to day variability. This can be attributed to the internal tidal modes which are sensitive to the varying meteorological conditions in the lower and in the middle atmosphere, in part also to solar activity. Near the dip equator (where the geomagnetic field lines are horizontal), a strong band of eastward flowing currents can be observed in a range of about 150 km from the equator . Such enhancement of the Sq current by a factor of about four is due to the Cowling conductivity. During a solar flare, bursts of solar radiation from the environment of an active sunspot reach the higher atmosphere, mainly at E- and D- layer heights, lasting at most for one hour. The electric conductivity increases, and the Sq current enhances on the daytime hemisphere. A small increase occurs, called geomagnetic solar flare effect or crochet.Richmond, A.DF., and S.V. Venkatesmaran, J. Geophys. Res., 81, 139,1971 During a solar eclipse, the electric conductivity decreases in the shadow region, and the Sq current and thus the Sq variation diminishes by a few nT in that area.Wagner, C.U., J. Atm. Terr. Phys., 25,529,1963 It is called a geomagnetic solar eclipse effect. Both events can be observed only during quiet geomagnetic activity. In the aftermath of strong magnetospheric disturbances, a current system develops into a quasi anti-Sq-current. It is generated by Joule heating in the polar thermosphere.Blanc, M., and A.D. Richmond, J. Geophys. Res., 85, 1669, 1980Zaka, K,.Z., et all., Ann. Geophys., 27, 3523, 2009 This current system is called Ddyn. Theory Figure 2. Blockdiagram illustrating coupling between the horizontal wind U and pressure p via the Ampere force jx Bo, and the Lorentz force Ux Bo. Here j is the electric current density, Bo the geomagnetic field, h the equivalent depth, œÉ the electric conductivity, and E the electric polarization field. In a self- consistent treatment of the coupled system, gate B must be closed. In conventional dynamo theories, gate B is open. In order to determine quantitatively the dynamo action of the neutral wind U, one starts with the horizontal momentum equation of the wind together with an equation for the divergence of the wind. The momentum equation balances the inertial force, the Coriolis force, and the horizontal gradient of pressure p. In addition, the Ampere force Jx Bo couples the electric current density j to the wind and pressure system. The equivalent depth h (the eigenvalue of the tidal mode) determines the divergence of the wind. The electric current must obey Ohm's law. An electric polarization field E is generated by charge separation to enforce the condition of no sources and sinks of the current. Feedback between wind and electric current occurs via the Lorentz force Ux B. Usually, the electric conductivity tensor œÉ is considered as a given data set, and a height integrated conductivity tensor Œ£ and a height integrated sheet current J are applied.Richmond, A.D., Geomagn. and Geoelectr. 31, 287,1979 In conventional models, the Ampere force is neglected. This means that gate B in Figure 2 is open. This is called a kinematic dynamo. Models with closed gate B are called hydromagnetic dynamos. The influence of the mutual coupling between wind and current can immediately be seen if one considers an infinitely large electric conductivity œÉ. In the kinematic model, the electric current would become infinitely large, while the wind amplitude remains constant. In the hydromagnetic model, the current reaches an upper limit, similar to a technical dynamo during short circuit, while the wind amplitude breaks down to a fraction of its original value. Charge separation acts like a self-impedance preventing the current to become infinitely large. =L-Current= Lunar (L) currents are weaker by a factor of about 20 than the Sq currents. The dominant wind component to drive these currents is the (2, 2) tidal mode. The L current is similar in shape as the Sq current, with the difference that four vortices instead of two exit. In each vortex a total current of about 4 kA flows. The seasonal variation of L is similar to that of Sq. During sunlit hours, L is strongly enhanced, while it approaches zero during the night. Thus, the L current exhibits, in addition, a modulation depending on the lunar phase. The geomagnetic effect of the L-current can best been seen near the dip equator where the Cowling conductivity strongly enhances that current. =DP1-Current= Interaction between solar wind plasma and the polar geomagnetic field produces a global-scale magnetospheric electric convection field directed from dawn to dusk with a potential difference of about 15 kV during quiet magnetospheric conditions, increasing substantially during disturbed conditions. Charge separation takes place at the magnetopause. This area is connected with the ionospheric dynamo region via the first open geomagnetic field lines with one footpoint within the auroral regions. Thus, electric discharging currents can flow via field-aligned currents as two small bands within the auroral zone dynamo layer, on the daytime as well as on the nighttime hemisphere. These currents are called DP1 current or auroral electrojets. Their magnitudes are of the order of Mega Amperes. Ohmic losses and thus Joule heating of these currents is comparable with that due to the solar XUV heat input within middle and lower latitudes during quiet conditions and much larger during disturbed conditions. Therefore, it dominates ionospheric and thermospheric dynamics and causes ionospheric and thermospheric storms Proelss, G.W., in Volland, H. (ed), \\"Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics\\", Vol. II, p.195, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1995Proelss, G. W., Surv. Geophys. 32, 101, 2011 =DP2-Current= The magnetospheric electric convection field drives a two cell current within the polar cup with their vortices situated on the morning and on the evening side. It is called DP2 current. That current exists already during quiet conditions (Sqp) and becomes enhances during disturbed conditions. It is mainly composed of electric Hall currents.Nishida, A., and S. Kokubun, Rev. Geophys. Space Sci., 9, 417,1971 =Polar-Ring Current= If the azimuthal component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is directed toward dusk, the magnetospheric plasma is slowed down in the northern polar cap and accelerated in the southern polar cap. If the azimuthal component of the IMF is directed toward dawn, the situation is reversed. This devitation from co-rotation disappears at lower latitudes. The magnetic effect on the ground within the polar regions corresponds to an ionospheric Hall current at about 10o polar distance encircling the magnetic poles in a clockwise direction as seen by an observer standing on the ground during interplanetatry sectors with fields pointing away from the sun, and in a counterclockwise direction during toward- sector polarity Svalgaard, L., J.

The village is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the dance-drama an Important Intangible Cultural Property, and a collection of thirteen (13) masks are a National Treasure. The ritual shares some of the major themes of Korean masked drama and Korean shamanism, namely satire and the ridicule of apostate Buddhist priests and the nobility. Ritual The annual village fertility rites known as dong-je include the reading of charms and prayers, but no masked drama. The special ritual of byeolsingut talnori or py≈èlsin kut-nori is performed irregularly at the end of December and early January in order to appease the deity Seonangsin. It has a five-hundred year history and has been designated an Important Intangible Cultural Property (No. 69, designated 1980). After a period of purification and confinement, there is a procession that is followed by the masked dance- drama, in eight main episodes (madang): :(1) Shaman episode (Mudong madang) :(2) Lion episode (Juji madang) :(3) Butcher's episode (Baekjeong madang) :(4) Old widow's episode (Halmi madang) :(5) Apostate monk‚Äôs episode (Pagyeseong madang) :(6) Nobleman and scholar‚Äôs episode (Yangban and Seonbi madang) :(7) Wedding ceremony episode (Holrye madang) :(8) Wedding night‚Äôs episode (Sinbang madang) The dance-drama, with musical accompaniment, exhibits considerable ribaldry, with the lions fighting and simulating intercourse; the butcher acting out the sacrifice of a bull before try to sell its heart and testicles; the old widow at the loom sadly singing of her solitary life; the lecherous, apostate monk stumbling upon Pune, a flirtatious young woman or dancing girl, while she micturates and, aroused, sniffing the ground before running off with her; the nobleman and scholar attempting to win Pune's favours by boasting of their good-breeding and learning, while she flirts with each in turn by killing his lice, before the proceedings are interrupted by a tax-collector; followed by the reenactment of a wedding ceremony and the ensuing wedding night that is so lifelike that minors and women are not allowed to watch. Masks Eleven masks (11) from Hahoe and two from the neighbouring village of Byeongsan have been designated a National Treasure (No. 121, designated 1964). While festival masks are typically made from a gourd or paper, and are often burned after the festivities are over, these masks are of painted alder wood, with movable jaws separately attached with a cord. The eleven surviving Hahoe masks ‚Äì others are believed lost, including that of the bachelor (Chonggak) ‚Äì include the two lions (Juji), butcher (Baekjeong), old widow (Halmi), the depraved monk (Chung), flirtatious young woman (Pune), nobleman (Yangban), scholar (Seonbi), bride (Gaksi), meddling low-class merchant (Choraengi), and fool (Imae).

Hon. George Charles, Baron de Dyhern (10 April 1710 ‚Äì 25 April 1759), was a Saxon general, war minister under the regency of Augustus III. of Saxony, king of Poland and a close friend of Field Marshal Count Frederick Augustus Rutowsky.  Family  Baron George Charles Dyhern (originally Georg Carl von Dyh(e)rn) was born in 1710 in G≈Çog√≥w as a member of the House of Dyhrn, an ancient prominent noble family from Silesia, who had distant relations to many European royals. His father was Baron Melchior Frederick de Dyhern, a wealthy Lord, who owned considerable land in Lubusz Voivodeship, and his mother was the Countess Helen de Nimptsch. His sister Marie Dyhern was the mother of the famous Marshal Fran√ßois Christophe de Kellermann, 1. duke of Valmy. Dyhern's grandniece, Baroness Caroline de Kottwitz, was the wife of the famous Prussian field marshal Count August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, who was a prominent figure in the German Campaign of 1813 and played an important role in the Battle of Waterloo under Bl√ºcher in 1815.  Life  Dyhern was a brilliant student. He studied theology, philosophy and mathematics and he completed his studies with highest distinction. In 1740 he married an Italian aristocrat in Prague, with whom he had two sons. Through his marriage Dyhern became a landowner in Bohemia. As a lieutenant, Dyhern took part in the battle of the Timok Valley in Hungary (today Serbia) in 1737 under the commandment of Count Frederick Augustus Rutowsky, who later become one of Dyhern's closest friends. During the War of the Austrian Succession, Dyhern fought as a major in Prague in 1741, as Marshal Maurice de Saxe made his unexpected night attack on the Bohemian capital. In 1745 he was a captain and in 1752 a generalmajor and also a general lieutenant of a Saxon regiment in service of the King Louis XV of France, with whom Dyhern was acquainted already since the middle of the 1730s, as he was studying and living in Versailles and Paris. As a general, Dyhern commanded the Saxonian army in Austria, France, Poland and Bohemia. He also became a war minister under the government of the Prime minister Count Heinrich von Br√ºhl and he was regularly corresponding with the Saxon Elector Augustus III, Prussian king Frederick the Great, the French king Louis XV. de Bourbon and others. In 1746 Dyhern wrote a book about wars, named Nachricht oder historische Erz√§hlung des Krieges-Handlungen, which was published in German in Hamburg and the same year translated in French and published as such in Cologne. In the Battle of Rossbach (1757) Dyhern fought as a commander of Saxon troops along with Prince Charles de Rohan, commander of the French army. France and Austria were defeated by Prussia. Two years later, on 13 April 1759, the Battle of Bergen in Hesse followed. Dyhern, as Saxon general along with Victor Fran√ßois de Broglie, Duke of Broglie, commander of the French army, fought against the armies of Great Britain, Hesse-Kassel, Brunswick and Hanover. Only a few weeks before the battle, Dyhern was still trying to make an agreement with the Prince de Isenburg, hessian commander, at their meeting in Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris, but unsuccessfully. In this battle, Dyhern, among many other men (also Prince Isenburg, who died on the same day as the battle took place) was seriously wounded, and brought to a hospital in Frankfurt. France and Saxony were then defeated. In Frankfurt he was tended by Dr. Fresenius, who later wrote a book about Dyhern and his great courageous personality. 12 days after he got the wound, Dyhern died at the age of 49. The Battle of Bergen made his reputation worldwide. The legendary Saxon general was even mentioned by Goethe in his literature -always as ‚Äúa brave general of liberal spirit‚Äù. General Dyhern's great personality and career was also mentioned in works of John Entick (in General History of the Late War), David Hume (in The History of England) and described in other scientific literature and newspapers all over Europe and America through the 18th and 19th century. General Dyhern was buried in Frankfurt, Hesse. At his funeral great generals as Count Rutowsky and Prince Francis Xavier of Saxony, with whom he was working with in the last years of his life, were in tears over the death of their great friend and colleague.

The Count Bishops had limited commercial success, but forged an important stylistic and chronological link between the root rhythm and blues band Dr. Feelgood and the proto punk sound of Eddie and the Hot Rods; together forming the foundation of the pub-rock scene, which influenced the emergence of punk rock. The group made history in England by releasing the first record from independent label Chiswick Records. They splintered following the death of guitarist Zenon DeFleur on 18 March 1979. History The Count Bishops formed in spring 1975 when members of the group Chrome joined the American vocalist Mike Spenser. In July of that year, Spenser (n√©e Scolnick) called fellow countryman Johnny Guitar from Paris for five days straight and finally convinced him (guitar) to pack up two Les Pauls and fly to the UK and join up with Spenser and Zenon DeFleur (so named by Johnny after seeing him passed out on the floor at their first recording session). They found Steve Lewins (bass) and Paul Balbi (drums) within a few weeks. The new line-up recorded the next month at Pathway Studios with Barry Farmer at the desk and of these 13 tracks, four became the Speedball EP, the first release of Chiswick Records. Shortly before the release (on Dutch label Dynamite) of the single \\"Taking it Easy\\" (released in the UK as \\"Train, Train\\"), Spenser left the band after an incident involving a glass door and his boot. Johnny and Zen handled lead vocals for the next year, including on the Dutch release \\"Good Gear\\" on the Dynamite label. After recording the backing tracks for their first LP on Chiswick, they decided to bring over Dave Tice (formerly of Australian band Buffalo). With this lineup, the group finished recording its debut UK album, and toured heavily making a name for themselves and bringing to a new level their traditional influences of the 1960s: beat music (the Beatles, the Rolling Stones) and garage rock (the Standells, the Strangeloves). For the rest of 1977, the Count Bishops toured continuously (including the support slot on the first Mot√∂rhead tour and John Cale's tour that year, as well as their own shows) and built a formidable army of fans - despite the fact that they did not fit the mold considered against the backdrop of old-fashioned punk movement. In the spring of 1978, they signed up for a live album with the participation of six groups of the Chiswick Records roster. The project was not fully realised, but the label released it as a mini-album called Live Bishops, reducing the band name to the Bishops. With this material (and a new bass player Pat McMullan, who replaced Steve Lewins) the Count Bishops toured extensively. In 1978, two singles (\\"I Take What I Want\\" and \\"I Want Candy\\") led the Count Bishops to an appearance on the TV show Top of the Pops. A few days after the release of their album Cross Cuts, which had been a year and a half in production, Zenon Hierowski crashed his Aston Martin and died on 17 March 1979, and instead of the anticipated \\"breakthrough\\" the Bishops were forced to retrench. They toured with Blitz Krieg (of Blast Furnace fame) deputising for Zen, and then Paul Balbi (drums) was deported back to Australia after returning from a Spanish festival. The band carried on with Charlie Morgan (Tom Robinson Band, Elton John) on drums and just Johnny on guitar for some months, including a tour of Australia with Balbi, but Zen's death had taken much of the impetus away and they split up.

In 2013, Amess signed on to play a lead in the musical parody Miserable Lesbians in New York and Edinburgh. The show was adapted from the Oscar-winning Les Mis√©rables and attracted global attention due to the issues of homosexual marriage and sex equality it raised. Amess reprised her role of Courgette (aka Cosette) from an earlier 2013 short-film version in support of homosexual rights of Miserable Lesbians for the \\"Toscars\\" at the famous Grauman's Chinese Theatre which saw the film sweep the boards, winning 8 out of 10 awards presented by Eric Roberts.

In Theoretical Computer Science, vol. 126, 183‚Äì235, pp. 194‚Äì1955 which makes this an interesting sub-class of hybrid automata. Extensions have been extensively studied, among them stopwatches, real-time tasks, cost functions, and timed games. There exists a variety of tools to input and analyse timed automata and extensions, including the model checkers UPPAAL, Kronos, and the schedulability analyser TIMES. These tools are becoming more and more mature, but are still all academic research tools.  Example  Before formally defining what a timed automaton is, some examples are given. Consider the language \\\\mathcal L of timed-words w over the unary alphabet \\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\} such that there is an a during the first time unit, and there is less than one time unit between two successive a. The timed automaton recognizing this language, pictured nearby, use a single clock x, which should never be equal to one. This clock counts the time since the start of the run if no a were emitted, or from the last a emitted otherwise. It means that each time an a is emitted, this clock is reset to zero. Timed automaton accepting the language a* such that a letter is emitted in each open interval of length one. Consider the language \\\\mathcal L of timed-words w over the binary alphabet \\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\} such that each a is followed by a b in the next time unit. The timed automaton recognizing this language, pictured nearby, recalls whether there was a a which was not followed by a b or not. If it is not the case, it accepts the run, otherwise it rejects it. Furthermore, when there is such a a, it has a clock x which recall the time elapsed since the first such a was emitted. In this case, a b can not be emitted if the clock is at least equal to one, and thus the run fails. A timed automaton accepting timed words over \\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\} where each occurrence of a is followed less than one time unit latter by an occurrence of b. Formal definition = Timed automaton = Formally, a timed automaton is a tuple \\\\mathcal A=\\\\langle \\\\Sigma,L,L_0,C,F,E\\\\rangle that consists of the following components: * \\\\Sigma is a finite set called the alphabet or actions of \\\\mathcal A. * L is a finite set. The elements of L are called the locations or states' of \\\\mathcal A. * C is a finite set called the clocks of \\\\mathcal A. * L_0\\\\subseteq L is the set of start locations. * F\\\\subseteq L is the set of accepting locations. * E\\\\subseteq L\\\\times \\\\Sigma\\\\times\\\\mathcal B(C)\\\\times\\\\mathcal P(C)\\\\times L is a set of edges, called transitions of \\\\mathcal A, where ** \\\\mathcal B(C) is the set of clock constraints involving clocks from C, and ** \\\\mathcal P(C) is the powerset of C. An edge (\\\\ell,\\\\sigma,g,r,\\\\ell') from E is a transition from locations \\\\ell to \\\\ell' with action \\\\sigma, guard g and clock resets r. = Extended state = A pair with a location \\\\ell and a clock valuation u is called either an extended state or a state. Note that the word state is thus ambiguous, since, depending on the author, it may mean either a pair or an element of L. For the sake of the clarity, this article will use the term location for element of L and the term extended location for pairs. Here lies one of the biggest difference between timed-automata and finite automata. In a finite automaton, at some point of the execution, the state is entirely described by the number of letter read and by a finite number of possible values, which are actually called \\"states\\". That means that, given a state and a suffix of the word to read, the remaining of the run is totally determined. Thus, the word \\"finite\\" in the name \\"finite automata\\". However, as it is explained in the section \\"run\\" below, in order to resume clocks are used to determine which transitions can be taken. Thus, in order to know the state of the automaton, you must both know in which location you are, and the clock valuation. = Run = Given a timed word w=(\\\\sigma_1,t_1),(\\\\sigma_2,t_2),\\\\dots, with \\\\sigma_i\\\\in\\\\Sigma, (t_i)_{i} an increasing sequence of non-negative number, and a timed-automaton \\\\mathcal A as above, a run is a sequence of the form (\\\\ell_0, u_0)\\\\xrightarrow[t_1]{\\\\sigma_1}(\\\\ell_1, u_1)\\\\dots satisfying the following constraint: * (initialization) \\\\ell_0\\\\in L_0 * (consecution), for all i\\\\ge1, there exists an edge in E of the form \\\\langle\\\\ell_{i-1},\\\\sigma_i,g_i,r_i,\\\\ell_i\\\\rangle such that: ** we assume that t_i-t_{i-1} time units passed, and at this time, the guard is satisfied. I.e. u_{i-1}+t_i-t_{i-1} satisfies g_i, ** the new clock valuation u_i corresponds to u_{i-1}, in which t_i-t_{i-1} time units passed and in which the clocks of r_i where reset. Formally, u_i=( u_{i-1}+t_i- t_{i-1})[r_i\\\\rightarrow 0]. The notion of accepting run is defined as in finite automata for finite words and as in B√ºchi automata for infinite words. That is, if w is finite of length n, then the run is accepting if \\\\ell_{n}\\\\in F. If the word is infinite, then the run is accepting if and only if there exists an infinite number of position i such that \\\\ell_i\\\\in F. = Deterministic timed automaton = As in the case of finite and B√ºchi automaton, a timed-automaton may be deterministic or non-deterministic. Intuitively, being deterministic has the same meaning in each of those case. It means that the set of start locations is a singleton, and that, given a state s, and a letter a, there is only one possible state which can be reached from s by reading a. However, in the case of timed-automaton the formal definition is slightly more complex. Formally, a timed-automaton is deterministic if: * L_0 is a singleton * for each pair of transitions (\\\\ell,\\\\sigma,g,r,\\\\ell') and (\\\\ell,\\\\sigma,g',r',\\\\ell), the set of clocks valuations satisfying g is disjoint from the set of clocks valuations satisfying g'.  Closure property  The class of languages recognized by non-deterministic timed automata is: * closed under union, indeed, the disjoint union of two timed automata recognize the union of the language recognized by those automata. * closed under intersection Modern Applications Of Automata, page 118. * not closed under complement.  Problems and their complexity  The computational complexity of some problems related to timed automata are now given. The emptiness problem for timed automaton can be solved by constructing a region automaton and checking whether it accepts the empty language. This problem is PSPACE-complete. The universality problem of non-deterministic timed automaton is undecidable, and more precisely Œ†. However, when the automaton contains a single clock, the property is decidable, however it is not primitive recursive. This problem consists in deciding whether every words are accepted by a timed-automaton.  See also  * Alternating timed automaton: an extension of timed automaton with universal transitions.

Murphy fails a professional assessment due to the murder of his young son by IRA terrorists, and is assigned to work in London. He is assigned a case investigating a North London funeral home, the proprietors of which are suspected diamond thieves. Development The novel was written when Bateman realised that the amount of material he had written for the TV series of the same name exceeded what would be produced. Bateman decided to change the name of the protagonist from \\"Tommy\\" to \\"Martin\\" as \\"I wanted to be able to control the character if ‚Äì as it turned out to be true ‚Äì I was no longer writing the series and someone else decided to take it in a different direction\\".

Denise Wels, for Reviewing The Evidence, stated \\"black humour abounds in a plot about funeral directors that fair begs for comic asides\\"; commenting that \\"Bateman has created some nasty villains\\", specifically Hatcher, who she found to be \\"totally immoral and sadistic finding entertainment in the troubles of others whilst displaying the most touching filial affection for his own deplorable parent\\".

Wharram Catamaran Designs Wharram designs are inspired by Polynesian double canoes and typically have an open deck, with small deckpod(s) for crew shelter. James Wharram combined boat building with studies of Polynesian culture. Most modern catamarans are built as a single rigid structure thereby sustaining greater forces and stresses in waves, whereas on Wharrams the separate hulls are connected to the crossbeams with (synthetic) rope lashings, in true Polynesian style. The flexibility of the Wharram system makes the boats suffer less stress in ocean waves.Harvey, Derek, Multihulls for Cruising and Racing, Adlard Coles, London 1990 p. 16, Wharram's designs have covered a range of sizes from the Hitia to the Pahi 63 Gaia.James Wharram Designs: Self Build Boats www.wharram.com, accessed 28 December 2019 The rig on Wharrams since the early 1980s is the 'Wharram Wingsail Rig',Wharram, James: Wharram Wingsail Rig an appropriate tech squareheaded rig with low turbulence pocket round the mast and a short adjustable gaff at the head.

Williams and McAlmon were able raise enough money to send the third issue, containing the only artwork to appear during the first run of Contact, to a professional printer, creating a noticeably superior production quality over the other issues in the first run. The fourth and fifth issues were printed on standard white paper. Although it published early work from such luminaries as Hilda Doolittle, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Williams, McAlmon, and Mina Loy, the magazine was never financially successful, and its circulation is estimated to have been around two hundred subscribers during the first run. Williams ended the first run in 1923 with a very brief fifth issue that contained a mere five poems. Williams revived Contact in 1932 under the name Contact: An American Quarterly Review. Although McAlmon was active in publishing works of Williams' circle through his own publishing company, Contact Publishing Company (a/k/a Contact Editions), he contributed some literary works to the revived magazine, and although he is listed as an associate editor on the masthead, McAlmon was no longer involved in the production of Contact during its second run. Instead, Williams chose Nathanael West to be his partner in running the magazine. Each of the three issues of Contact's second run is approximately 130 pages in length. Advertising, mostly for books by Contact's contributors or otherwise published by Contact Editions, appear at the beginning of the magazine, and notably the magazine contains one of the first large bibliographies of contemporary little magazines. This bibliography, compiled by David Moss, was too large to publish in a single edition of Contact and therefore ran over the course of all three of the 1932 issues. In addition, the second run of Contact contained chapters from West's novel Miss Lonelyhearts and four poems by E. E. Cummings.  Further reading  * Martin, Jay. Nathanael West: The Art of His Life.

It aired on Fox in the United States on May 6, 2012. Plot After a local restaurant closes following a bad review by a vicious food critic called the Moody Foodie (Patton Oswalt), one of Bob's friends and a fellow restaurant owner named Reggie warns Bob that his restaurant is next. Since the Moody Foodie always wears a disguise, Bob's family tries to work out which of their customers he could be until a man dressed as a Hasidic Jew comes in and wipes his hands with a blue handkerchief, his \\"tell.\\" Unfortunately, the family make fools of themselves, culminating in Bob forgetting what the Moody Foodie's order was, and Gene accidentally setting the grill on fire. The local paper publishes a harsh review, which Bob angrily obsesses over. After Tina suggests that he try a \\"redo\\", Bob heads to the Moody Foodie's house to make him another burger, but since he refuses to let him in, Bob and the kids force themselves in and tie him to a chair with duct tape. While Bob tries to feed him the \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fennel\\" Burger, Linda visits him with other restaurateurs who have been given bad reviews who now want their chance at a redo as well, and they force feed him their food and even one of his reviews, until a man delivering a package interrupts them. They tie him to a chair as well, and Louise opens the package to find a DVD of the movie Tin Cup, which Bob begins to mock as a bad movie. Everyone else says that it's not a bad movie, but Bob adamantly says it must be, until he realizes he hasn't seen it and only thinks that because of a bad review. This leads him to have an epiphany: the Moody Foodie's bad review was just him doing his job, and he should just let it go. After paying the deliveryman $48 plus the DVD edition of Tin Cup to forget about what happened, they set the Moody Foodie and the deliveryman free, but not until one of the restaurateurs gives the Moody Foodie a wet willy (in a parody of the ear-cutting scene from Reservoir Dogs). Business in Bob's Burgers returns to normal after he gives discounts to anyone bringing in a copy of the review. Bob wonders why the cops haven't come yet to arrest him yet. A flashback reveals that, after everyone left, the Moody Foodie actually intended to call the cops, but after he tried the burger, he enjoyed it so much he decided not to press charges. Reception The episode received a 1.8 rating and was watched by a total of 3.72 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating The Cleveland Show, but losing to American Dad!, The Simpsons and Family Guy with 5.64 million. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, saying \\"One of the reasons ‚ÄúMoody Foodie‚Äù works so well is that each of its situations allows the characters to behave in a different, amusing fashion. The nervousness of the Belcher family at the impending arrival of the critic puts Bob in the role of the straight man, with each of the other family members responding to the anxiety differently. Linda, usually one of the more difficult characters for the show to handle, may be best here, giving ‚Äúpep talks‚Äù which do the opposite of pepping. Louise, of course, is an all-star throughout the episode, scoring with this suggestion: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs bribe him. Dad, take out the lettuce and replace it with this $20 bill that I took out of your wallet.\\" References External links  Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Bob's Burgers (season 2) episodes ","title":"Moody Foodie"},{"id":"35707831","text":"St Luke's Church is in Lodge Road, Orrell, Wigan, Greater Manchester, England.

This conformational switch is proposed to play a role in RNA alternative splicing and may influence the production of M1 and M2 proteins produced by splicing of this pre-mRNA.  Overview  Figure 1. Diagram of the influenza segment 7 transcript showing the open reading frames for M1 and the spliced M2 proteins. Below left is the hairpin conformation while below right is the pseudoknot. The branch point is annotated in purple, the polypyrimidine tract in blue, the 3' splice site with a red arrow and the SF2/ASF exonic enhancer site in orange This structured region was first discovered in a bioinformatics survey of influenza A based on thermodynamic folding free energy and amino acid codon suppression. Initial models of the secondary structure were based on computational methods for Nucleic acid structure prediction. The hairpin conformation was predicted using RNAalifold, while the pseudoknot was predicted with DotKnot. Segment 7 encodes the M1 protein and the smaller M2 proton channel protein, which is produced by RNA splicing. M2 protein is critical to the virus: it forms the ion channels that allow for acidification of the virion that stimulates in un-coating. The 3' splice site region used to produce M2 was experimentally probed with structure-sensitive chemicals and enzymes and was found to adopt both the hairpin and pseudoknot conformations in solution. Each conformation places important splicing regulatory sites in different structural environments, which has implications for the modulation of splicing of the segment 7 transcript. For example, the splice site, polypyrimidine tract, branch point, and ASF/SF2 exonic enhancer binding sites are expected to be more accessible in the hairpin conformation and less accessible in the pseudoknot (Figure 1). By shifting the equilibrium between the pseudoknot and hairpin it may be possible to reduce or enhance M2 splicing, respectively. Potentially shared mechanism  This putative mechanism may also be one that is common to spliced influenza transcripts. A similarly placed, but structurally distinct, influenza virus pseudoknot/hairpin was also described in the 3' splice site of segment 8 transcripts, which encode the NP and, by splicing, NEP proteins. These structures form a family of structured RNAs shared between influenza A and influenza B  Host species specific structural stability  The 3' splice site structures in influenza A segment 7 show host-species specific trends in structural stability. The greatest number of structurally stabilizing mutations occur in avian specific strains, while the most structurally destabilizing mutations occurred in human strains: swine fell in between. This general trend in stability: avian, swine, human, roughly follows the temperatures at which the influenza virus reproduces within each host species. The temperatures of the avian gut and the swine and human lung are 42, 37, and 34 degrees Celsius, respectively. This observation is a local instance of a global trend in influenza A coding sequences, where avian, swine, and human strains show different stability. It may be the case that RNA structure is more stable in hosts where the replication temperature is high in order to preserve functional structures or important structural equilibria.

It is about a woman who finds an abandoned baby at a rest stop and decides to raise the child as her own. The book was published in August 2010 by St. Martin's Griffin. Plot The story focuses on Ruby Leander, a nineteen-year-old runaway, who finds a baby in the trash at an Oklahoma rest stop. She makes a split-second decision to take the child as her own, rescuing it from a life of abandonment like her own. Ten years later, she has built a life for herself and her daughter, Lark, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. She works as a manicurist and has a steady relationship with boyfriend of three years, Chaz, and is expecting his child. Ruby has told her daughter that her father died in an accident. However, she is forced to face her past when she reads an article in a magazine that shows her daughter as a missing child, thought to have been kidnapped by carjackers. She must decide whether to come clean about Lark's origins or continue to live the lie. She decides to tell Lark how she found her in a car seat dumped in a trash can, that she is not her biological mother, and that the childcare authorities were not involved in any way with her apparently illegitimate adoption. Development The inspiration for this book came from Bourret's work with child advocacy organizations. She often wrote about lost children from a young age and it is a recurring theme in her recent work. Bourret made a few half-hearted attempts at getting her manuscript published directly, before stowing it away. After encouragement from fellow members of a writing group, Bourret began once more trying to find an agent for her book. The manuscript was accepted by the first literary agent that read it; however, it took that agent so long to accept that Bourret had already sent the manuscript to 52 other agents, each of whom rejected it. Reception Library Journal responded positively with a \\"Starred Review\\", and stated that \\"Bourret nails the character development and pacing that make a good novel compelling.\\" Comparing Bourret to Jodi Picoult, reviewer Beth Gibbs said the novel was \\"perfect for summer reading\\".

Self-propelled modular transporters moving Hamilton, Ontario's Aberdeen Bridge span into place. Rapid bridge replacement or accelerated bridge construction (ABC) is a technique that allows bridges to be replaced with minimum disruption to traffic. The replacement bridge is constructed on a site near the bridge to be replaced. When it is completed, the old bridge is cut away and removed using self- propelled modular transporters (SPMTs). Then the SPMTs lift the new bridge, transfer it to the work site and put it in place. Often the highway or railroad carried by the bridge is closed for just one weekend. Conventional techniques typically replace half a bridge at a time, with all highway traffic redirected under the other bridge half, often for a year or more, while construction progresses. Accelerated Bridge Construction(ABC) alternatives consist of ABC components and ABC techniques. Components can be categorized into prefabricated bridge elements (e.g. beams, bridge decks, footings, columns, pier caps, abutments etc.) or prefabricated bridge systems (e.g. bridge modules with superstructures and/or substructures). ABC involves fabrication of these elements or systems off-site in a regulated environment, and transporting those to site for installation. Related processes such as lifting, placement, transportation, embankment construction are termed as ABC techniques. Notable rapid bridge replacement projects include Interstate 93 in Massachusetts, where 14 bridges were replaced over 10 weekends in 2011. Standards =NEXT Beam= The first NEXT Beam bridge in York, Maine The development of Northeast Extreme Tee Beam or NEXT Beam was started in 2006 by the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI) North East to update regional standard on accelerated bridge construction for northeastern states of the United States. The NEXT Beam design was inspired by double-tee designs that have been used to build railroad platform slabs. The use of double tees with wide flange allows to have less number of beams and to have them stay in place to form the deck, resulting in a shorter construction time. The first design was introduced in 2008 called \\"NEXT F\\" with flange thickness requires topping. This was used for the construction of the Maine State Route 103 bridge that crosses the York River. The seven-span long bridge was completed in 2010 as the first NEXT Beam bridge. The second design was introduced in 2010 for Sibley Pond Bridge at the border of Canaan and Pittsfield, Maine. The design was called \\"NEXT D\\" with flange thickness that does not require deck topping allowing the wearing surface can be applied directly on to the beams. The combination of F and D called \\"NEXT E\\" was introduced in 2016. As of 2018, thirteen US states that accept the NEXT Beam standard are Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia. New Brunswick, Canada also accepts the standard.

It follows a young Madurese boy as he searches for his mother through the International Physics Olympiad. Plot Muhammad Arief (Sayef Muhammad Billah), the son of poor family in Sumenep, Madura Island, greatly enjoys science, especially physics. His father, Muslat (Lukman Sardi), is a former salt farmer who became a driver after an economic downturn. His mother, Salmah (Helmalia Putri), has gone abroad in search of work; the family have not heard from her, and Arief misses her. Although it is difficult due to his economic situation, Arief studies physics diligently. Arief's physics teacher Tari Hayat (Revalina S. Temat), seeing potential in him after Arief retrieves a ball from a tree with a rocket, suggests that he participate in the International Physics Olympiad in Singapore. Arief agrees, but his main goal is to find his mother. After the selection process in Jakarta, Arief goes to the Olympiad with fellow would-be- physicists Muhammad Thamrin (Angga Putra) and Clara Annabela (Dinda Hauw). After arriving in Singapore, the Indonesian team wins several matches. However, just before the finals Arief discovers that his mother is to leave for Malaysia. Although at first he decides to rush to the port to stop her, he is convinced to stay with the Olympiad team, who win the competition. Arief then stops his mother from going to Malaysia, and the two return to Madura. Production Mestakung was directed by John de Rantau, best known for the Academy Award-submitted Denias Senandung Di Atas Awan (Denias, Singing on the Cloud; 2006) and Obama Anak Menteng (Obama, Child of Menteng(2009). It was written by Hendrawan Wahyudianto and de Rantau; production was handled by Mizan Production and Falcon Picture, with Putut Widjanarko serving as producer. Mestakung's title was derived the philosophy of physicist Yohanes Surya, who had trained Indonesia's International Physics Olympiad team; Surya taught that, when a person needed to succeed at his or her goals, the universe would work to support person. He called this , which means the universe supports. The events in the film are based on a true story, which occurred to the 2006 Indonesian Physics Olympiad team. Numerous Indonesian actors were chosen for roles, including Laura Basuki, who had won a Citra Award at the 2010 Indonesian Film Festival. Surya had a cameo in the film. Shooting took place over three weeks in Madura and Singapore. Mestakung's soundtrack was mostly handled by the Indonesian band Goliath. Initially asked to record a single song, the band recorded three within a month, which were accepted by the film's producers. However, a traditional Madurese song was included, as was the song \\"Indonesia\\", as sung by Powerslaves. Release and reception Mestakung, initially scheduled for an August release, premiered on 18 October 2011 at XXI Gandaria City, South Jakarta; wide release followed on 20 October. Triwik Kurniasari, writing for The Jakarta Post, wrote that the film had inspirational ideas but suffered due to poor acting by Billah.

(JCI) is based in Kolkata, is an agency of the government of India that assists jute cultivators in states where this crop is grown, providing minimum price support. An audit issued in February 2010 identified various deficiencies in the JCI operations that were severely handicapping its effectiveness. Background Traditionally the jute trade in India has been controlled by middlemen, with a large difference between what the mills pay and what the farmers receive. The jute industry suffers from wide fluctuations in price and supply due to rapid changes in the area cultivated and to the effects of the weather. High prices one year may lead to over-planting and a glut the next year. Both the growers and the mills that use the crop suffer from these fluctuations. International users have shifted to synthetic fibers in part due to the uncertain supply and in part to high export duties imposed by the Indian government. The government has had to take over the operations of mills that could not compete in this difficult market. The JCI was established in an attempt to stabilize prices, create a buffer stock for the mills and ensure that farmers received a fair return. Operations Since 1966/1967 the government has fixed the MSP for different types of jute and mesta based on recommendations from the Commission for Agricultural Cost and Prices. JCI was established in 1971. At first a small agency, it has steadily grown and now operates in the main jute-growing states of West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh. As of 2004 the JCI operated 171 departmental purchase centers and 69 state- level cooperative centers, and purchased from almost 250 village-level cooperatives. Each of the purchase centers was in hired premises and included an import shed, assortment shed, bale press shed, bale storage godown and office. The JCI had enough total storage for 215,000 bales each weighing . The company purchases jute at the defined minimum price when market prices drop to this level, and later sells the jute to jute mills. In times when demand is strong there may be no need to make purchases since the price remains above the MSP. However, the JCI continues commercial operations in these years. In the 1980s the JCI experienced difficulty in disposing of its stocks of raw jute purchased under the MSP. The Ministry of Textiles used the power vested in the Jute Commissioner under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 to fix the price of B.Twill bags and to require private jute mills to lift raw jute from the JCI. This practice has remained in force since then. As implementing agency of JTM Mini Mission-III, JCI is engaged in developing market infrastructure like Market Yards, Departmental Purchase Centers (DPCs) etc. and to develop market linkage for jute growers. In recent years JCI is engaged in promoting alternate jute retting technologies viz. jute decorticator, enzyme based retting. Issues The JCI has made a loss in almost every year of operation since it was founded in 1971/1972.But in recent years it has started making profits. The Government of India provides an annual subsidy to cover the MSP, even in years where there is no MSP outlay. In these years the subsidy is set aside for future use. For the 2011-2012 budget year the amount granted was ‚Çπ550 million. When there is a plentiful jute crop, as in 1979-1980 and 1985‚Äì1986, the JCI has purchased large quantities at the MSP but the price in many other jute markets has fallen below the MSP. In years with low production, prices have soared even though the JCI released what it could from its stocks. A review of operations up to 1978 found that the JCI had failed to meet its objective of stabilizing price and supply. It did not have the organization it needed for effective operations, was short of funding and was handicapped by interference in the way it operated from the Ministry. The recommendation from this review was to give the JCI a monopoly of jute purchases. A 2010 audit said the company still did not provide effective price support. In the years from 2003 to 2009 the company only bought between 0.99% and 10.4% of the available jute, and covered 43% of jute trading centers. At times the JCI stopped purchases due to lack of storage facilities, forcing farmers to sell at lower prices to middlemen. The 2010 audit recommended a number of improvements to procedures combined with scaled-up operations so as to provide more effective support to the jute growers. It took pressure from chief minister Mamata Banerjee of West Bengal to force JCI to purchase jute direct from farmers rather than from middlemen. In October 2011 farmers demonstrated against the low prices offered for their produce in Bechimari, Darrang, Assam, blocking off a road and then attacking vehicles. The police fired, killing four jute farmers. The farmers' complaint was that a cartel of buyers was keeping prices artificially low. In response the state authorities announced that the sales tax on raw jute would be dropped and a new jute mill would be established at Dalgaon. They could not, however, change the minimum price set by JCI.

This system, the Pioneer LaserActive, was a cross-platform video game console, Laserdisc player, and CD player. LD-ROMs owe their greater capacity to a design for constant linear velocity (CLV) playback.

Since Pioneer intended LD-ROMs primarily for computer software, they chose CLV technology to increase the file storage capacity. Specialized LD-ROM discs include the MEGA LD (for Sega Mega CD/Sega CD software), the LD-G (for karaoke data or digital photo albums; similar to CD+G), and the LD-ROM¬≤ (for PC-Engine CD-ROM¬≤ software).

It is currently in the permanent collection at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Description Tidying Up depicts a young contemporary (1930s or 1940s) working woman in an unguarded moment of checking herself in her hand mirror. Bishop's work generally focuses on young women caught during the idle moments away from their jobs. Her active brushwork served to reflect the upward social mobility experienced by working women of this period, while her color palette recalls works of the Italian Renaissance. Bishop's subject matter is quickly rendered, and lines are expressive and dynamic. Her quick brushstroke evokes the everyday activity and animation of the modern city. Historical information Educated at the New York School of Applied Design for Women, Bishop was part of the loosely organized Fourteenth Street School, who were influenced by the realism of the Ashcan School. They painted scenes of daily life that concentrated on middle-class and lower-class peoples. Bishop focused on female subjects, usually in work settings. She spent more than ten years painting the secretaries, sales clerks, and blue-collar workers who lived or worked in and around Union Square. Her favorite subject was women going about their everyday lives, eating, talking, putting on makeup, taking off their coats. These ordinary motions produced facial expressions that Bishop felt revealed the personality of the people she portrayed. =Acquisition= The Indianapolis Museum of Art purchased Tidying Up from Midtown Galleries in New York City in 1943.

Facilities include a large teaching hospital ‚Äì Bristol Royal Infirmary ‚Äì which offers nationally commissioned specialist cardiac, cancer and children's services from its city-centre campus to patients in the southwest of England and beyond. History From 1947 to 1974, NHS services in Bristol were managed by the South-Western Regional Hospital Board. In 1974 the boards were abolished and replaced by Regional Health Authorities, with Bristol coming under the South Western RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1996 and Bristol came under the South and West (Wessex and South Western) Regional Health Authority. Bristol from 1974 was under Avon Area Health Authority divided into three district health authorities: Bristol and Weston, Southmead and Frenchay. This continued until 1993 when the three authorities were combined into Avon DHA, and area health authorities were abolished. Two primary care trusts (PCT) were established covering the whole county in 2002, Bristol North PCT and Bristol South and West PCT. They were merged to form Bristol PCT in 2006. The PCTs were managed by the South West strategic health authority from 2002 until 2013, when services were transferred to the new Bristol clinical commissioning group (CCG). During the COVID-19 pandemic a temporary 300-bed NHS COVID-19 critical care hospital, one of seven NHS Nightingale Hospitals in England, was built at the Exhibition and Conference Centre of the University of the West of England. It would be ready for use from 25 April, but would only be used if needed during the peak of the outbreak. Commissioning Bristol CCG took on the responsibilities of the former PCT on 1 April 2013. In August 2017, it announced plans to merge with the CCGs in North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. They started sharing a chief executive in February 2017. The three CCGs merged in April 2018 to form the Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG. =Service restrictions= In September 2015, a survey by the Health Service Journal showed that 34 of 188 CCGs who responded to the survey had restricted access to some services. Restrictions were usually introduced by a number of CCGs acting together across an area. Gloucestershire and Bristol CCGs were proposing restricted access to acupuncture, adenoidectomy and post-operative physiotherapy. =Sustainability and transformation plans= Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire formed a sustainability and transformation plan area in March 2016, with Robert Woolley, Chief Executive of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, as its leader. The area faces a projected 2020/21 deficit of ¬£305.5million. The plan is to reduce the number of acute beds in the area by 30%. The commissioner deficit for 2017-18 was ¬£90M, one of the largest, proportionally, in England. Bristol City Council refused to support plans to cut ¬£305M from the Bristol area's NHS funding at its meeting in January 2017. In 2018, Julia Ross was appointed joint STP lead, alongside Robert Woolley. She said in April 2018 that they were setting up six \\"locality provider groups\\" across the region to join up services for a defined population. This will start with GP and community services, probably in Weston. NHS trusts and hospitals University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust manages hospitals in the centre and south of the city, and at Weston-super- Mare. *Bristol Royal Infirmary (has Accident & emergency (A&E;) **Bristol Heart Institute **Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre *South Bristol Community Hospital *Bristol Royal Hospital for Children (has A&E;) *St. Michael's Hospital *Bristol Eye Hospital (has A&E; daytime every day, eye only) *University of Bristol Dental Hospital North Bristol NHS Trust manages hospitals in the north of the Bristol and South Gloucestershire. *Southmead Hospital (has A&E;) *Cossham Memorial Hospital *Frenchay Hospital Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust manages mental health services in the city. *Blackberry Hill Hospital *Callington Road Hospital *Petherton Resource Centre *Brookland Hall From April to December 2014, Frenchay Hospital was progressively closed, with the majority of services moving to a new building at Southmead Hospital. A&E; was transferred on 19 May 2014. Some services relating to brain and head injuries have remained at the site since December 2014. NHS Blood and Transplant The Organ Donation and Transplantation Directorate of NHS Blood and Transplant is based in Stoke Gifford, Bristol. They also operate a permanent donor centre at Southmead Hospital. Private hospitals * Spire Bristol Hospital * Nuffield Health Bristol Hospital Primary care There are 55 general practitioner (GP) practices in the county. Out-of-hours services are provided by Brisdoc, who also took over Bishopston Medical Practice in February 2018 after the partners resigned. It also runs Broadmead Medical Centre, Northville Family Practice, the homeless healthcare service and the GP support unit at Bristol Royal Infirmary. Unity Sexual Health, a partnership between University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust and several organisations, provides sexual health and pregnancy advice services at local clinics and at the Central Health Clinic. A pilot scheme called the 'digital minor illness referral service' was launched in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire in July 2019. General practitioners are encouraged to refer patients with low-acuity symptoms to community pharmacies, which are paid ¬£14 for each consultation. Community care Until 2013, community health services were run by the Primary Care Trust. Since then these services have been contracted out with adult and children's services being tendered separately. Bristol Community Health, a community interest company, were the new provider of adult community health services, and North Bristol NHS Trust continued to provide children's community health services, having originally won the contract for this in 2009. Bristol Community Health remain the provider of adult community health services, however it was announced in August 2015 that North Bristol NHS Trust were not bidding to renew the contract for children's community health services because of the ‚Äúnon-core nature of the service‚Äù, a ‚Äúlack of management capacity‚Äù and ‚Äúfinancial pressure‚Äù. In October 2015, the new contract to provide these services in Bristol and South Gloucestershire was awarded to a partnership between Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust, Sirona Care & Health and Bristol Community Health. Julia Ross, the newly appointed chief executive of Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire CCG said in April 2018 that community services in her patch should be consolidated into a single service. Healthwatch Healthwatch Bristol is an organisation set up under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to act as a voice for patients. Mental health =Adult services= There was long-standing unhappiness with mental health services in Bristol delivered by Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust (AWP), which was accused of being \\"centralist, top-down, target driven, bureaucratic and controlling\\" instead of putting patients first. The CCG have recommissioned services under the Bristol Mental Health brand. Bristol Mental Health is a consortium led by Avon and Wiltshire, working in partnership with nine third sector providers: Second Step; Missing Link; Off the Record (charity) Bristol; the Nilaari Agency; Stand Against Racisim and Inequality; Knowle West Health Park; Wellspring Healthy Living Centre; Southmead Development Trust; and Brunelcare. There are seven service bundles. The CCG has a contract with each provider for each service bundle: *community mental health services; *community rehabilitation services; *dementia wellbeing service; *mental health employment service; *assertive engagement service for people living chaotic lives; *Bristol Sanctuary for people in severe emotional distress or early crisis; and *community access service for harder to reach communities. Bristol Mental Health commenced operation in October 2014. =Child services= Children‚Äôs community services are jointly commissioned by the CCGs and local authorities. Bristol City Council and South Gloucestershire jointly commission services for both areas, including community child health and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. The service is provided by the Community Children's Health Partnership, which is a partnership between Sirona Care & Health, Bristol Community Health, Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust and Barnardo's. The North Bristol NHS Trust, in partnership with the Barnardo's charity, had provided the service from March 2009 to 2016. In 2015 the North Bristol NHS Trust announced that it would not continue the contract beyond March 2016, in order to focus on \\"acute and hospital based care\\". =Major service locations for mental health in Bristol= * Callington Road Hospital * Blackberry Hill Hospital * Southmead Hospital * Petherton Resource Centre * Brookland Hall * Greenway Centre Closed hospitals On 7 January 2013, the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, founded in 1852 but with a history as a dispensary dating back to 1832, moved operations from its own building, Hampton House, to the South Bristol Community Hospital. In-patient services had been provided at Hampton House until 1986, when they were moved to the Bristol Eye Hospital, with out- patients continuing at Hampton House. Homeopathy services ceased at the South Bristol Community Hospital in October 2015, and in September 2018 CCGs in the area decided to cease funding homeopathy. Bristol General Hospital closed in early April 2012, with services moved to Bristol Royal Infirmary and the newly opened South Bristol Community Hospital. Until the changes brought in by the Care in the Community policy in the 1980s, the Bristol area had a number of hospitals for patients with a mental disorder or developmental disability, including Barrow Hospital, Brentry Hospital, Glenside Hospital, Hortham Hospital and Stoke Park Hospital. Manor Park Hospital was the major geriatric hospital in South West England. In 1993, it merged with the residual mental health activities from the closing of Glenside Hospital, forming Blackberry Hill Hospital. Geriatric services were closed here in 2005, mainly leaving AWP operated mental health services at Blackberry Hill Hospital. Brislington House (now known as Long Fox Manor) was built as a private lunatic asylum for the insane. When it opened in 1806, it was one of the first purpose built asylums in England. It is situated on the Bath Road in Brislington, although parts of the grounds cross the city boundary into the parish of Keynsham in Bath and North East Somerset. The Palladian fronted building was originally seven separate blocks into which patients were allocated depending on their class. The buildings, estate and therapeutic regime designed by Edward Long Fox was based on the principles of moral treatment which was fashionable at the time. Brislington House later influenced the design and construction of other asylums and influenced Acts of parliament. The house and ancillary structures are listed buildings which have now been converted into private residences. The original grounds are Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England and now include St. Brendan's Sixth Form College, sports pitches and some farmland. They are now included on the Heritage at Risk Register.

During the fight Bloodfang is wounded in the face by Blackheart, leaving him with permanent scars. Bloodfang flees, and becomes an outcast from the pack. Forced to fend for himself, the young tyrannosaur initially struggles to survive, and nearly starves. His first meal without his mother's assistance consists of carrion. However, when other dinosaurs (four sauroctoni) try to steal his meal from him, he cunningly bides his time until they have gorged themselves, and then attacks them when, sleepy and bloated, they are vulnerable, killing two and driving the others away. Over the next four years he grows to become six metres tall and weigh ten tonnes, by which time he has learned to be a ferocious fighter, stronger than most adults of his species. Bloodfang returns to his pack during mating season, and kills a rival male tyrannosaur to steal his harem of females. Bloodfang quickly establishes his status as one of the strongest of the pack, but backs down when challenged by Blackheart, who is still the leader. Eventually, during a final reckoning, Bloodfang kills Blackheart and usurps him as leader of the pack, while the rest of the pack feast on Blackheart's corpse. =Second series= In the second series (30 episodes, 90 pages) time-travellers from 2150, hunting dinosaurs for meat with which to feed the people of the 22nd century, attack Bloodfang's pack. Bloodfang fights back, but is eventually captured, brought to 2150 and kept in a zoo. Escaping, he goes on a rampage, killing many humans, until he returns to his own time. Carlos Cruz illustrated the first 22 episodes, and Vanyo the remaining eight. Reprint The first series was reprinted in the monthly comic Best of Eagle no. 6 (1988).

Pasupathi Nayanar was a learned Brahmin devotee who practised chanting of the Shri Rudram Chamakam, a Vedic hymn dedicated to Rudra (a form of Shiva). Therefore, he is known by the name Rudra Pasupathi Nayanar. Hagiography Rudra Pasupathi Nayanar was born in a pious Brahmin family in the small village of Thiruthalayur, now located in Nannilam taluk, Thiruvarur District (17 km south of Mayiladuthurai and on the Nedungadu-Karaikal route via Kollumaangudi).ConsecrationThe Hindu, Friday, 20 October 2006 At Thiruthalayur, there is an ancient Shiva temple called Sri Parvati Samedha Sri Baleswarar temple.

It was written by Mikl√≥s K√ºzmics (1737‚Äì1804), the dean of Prekmurje and the R√°ba Valley. The publication in 1780 was financed by J√°nos Szily, the first bishop of Szombathely. Szv√©ti evangy√©liomi had a significant role in the formation of standard Prekmurje Slovene. It was a standard for numerous works published in Prekmurje from 1780 until 1920. K√ºzmics began his work in 1763. However, he did not receive support from the bishop of Gy≈ër. When Istv√°n K√ºzmics's Protestant translation, Nouvi Z√°kon, was published, he was greatly disappointed. Slovene Catholics had to read Protestant books because they did not have their own. K√ºzmics called for bishops to take action against the \\"heretical\\" New Testament. For a long time it was thought that K√ºzmics had copied his text from Nouvi Z√°kon. However, despite some similarities, the texts are different. Mikl√≥s K√ºzmics translated the Kajkavian Szveti evangeliomi by Nikola Krajaƒçeviƒá, which was used in Prekmurje and the R√°ba Valley, Haloze, the Slovene Hills, and Prlekija. Istv√°n K√ºzmics also used Krajaƒçeviƒá's gospels as a source, but in his Nouvi Z√°kon Kajkavian elements are very strong. Anton Vratu≈°a concluded that Mikl√≥s tried to use more original Prekmurje dialect words. Nouvi Z√°kon was only a secondary source, from which he did not translate.

It is uniform in design and used on all ESPN networks. It displays current sports scores, stats, and headlines in a 'push-then-scroll' format. It also serves as a display for urgent information, such as breaking sports news, breaking significant national news from ESPN sister network ABC, updated scores, a rain delay notification, or the move of a game from one ESPN network to another. On special occasions, a customized version of the ticker may be used; some examples are Pi day, in which a Pi symbol is placed next to the ESPN logo, and the 4th of July, when an American flag surrounds the ESPN logo.  History  SportsCenter debuted a new graphics package on April 6, 2009, with the \\"rundown\\" graphic (shown during the daytime editions) moved to the left side of the screen. A new BottomLine was also released that day on ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN Classic, and ESPNU but it was quickly removed and reverted to the old BottomLine (which had been used since April 2003) because of major technical difficulties. The new BottomLine was functional during coverage of the 2009 NFL Draft and the 2009 NBA Draft, but the issues were fixed and the it eventually returned on July 8 of the same year. Yet another redesigned BottomLine was launched at 11 PM ET on June 22, 2014, to coincide with a dramatic redesign of the SportsCenter studio. On August 20, 2018, a refreshed BottomLine launched. The BottomLine switched to a \\"flipper\\" format, used two lines of text, and no longer showed the logos of teams during score updates. In addition, the rightmost third of the BottomLine was now used for promoting events on the channel, the ESPN+ subscription service, or giving information on delays or breaking news events.  Variants  = ESPN 2 = In 1995, ESPN2 debuted a sports news ticker, dubbed by Production Assistant Onnie Bose as the \\"BottomLine Update.\\" It is a persistent ticker which stayed at the bottom of the screen at all times during most programming, unlike ESPN, who only showed their own at the :18 (formerly :28) and :58 of each hour (accompanied by an audio cue, which has since been adapted as the alert tone for ESPN's mobile apps) and during select programming. The introductory audio cue was removed when the BottomLine graphics were updated in 2009. ESPN2's sports telecasts were also among the first to regularly use a scoring bug. In later years, ESPN2 would also participate in \\"Full Circle\\" telecasts, productions of a single game aired across multiple ESPN services to provide additional features and angles. = ESPNEWS = ESPNEWS's \\"bottom line\\" ‚Äî a small rectangular area at the bottom one-fifth of the screen flashing scores‚Äîis more in-depth than the one airing on ESPN's other networks. It contains not only scores but also statistics and brief news alerts about the day's happenings in sports. It also remains on screen during most commercial breaks. This particular BottomLine was re- designed as the network was re-launched on March 30, 2008. The change from a big BottomLine to the ESPN-shaped BottomLine, the decrease of ESPNEWS programming, and SportsCenter being shown on ESPNEWS has had some controversy among longtime ESPNEWS viewers. The network was changed over to a full-screen presentation on June 2010 with the network receiving the BottomLine used on all other ESPN networks in anticipation of the network's primetime programming being rebranded under the SportsCenter branding. = ESPN on ABC = For most of its history, ABC's BottomLine ticker used the same design as ESPN's with the only exceptions being formatted to the 4:3 aspect ratio, the ABC logo being located on top of the ticker rather than being docked on the ticker itself, and promotions for ABC network programs included. Beginning with the 2016 Little League World Series, ABC's BottomLine ticker was switched to 16:9 ratio used by the other ESPN networks as ABC later switched its programming to a 16:9 format the following month. During NBA broadcasts, the logo is moved to the far right corner of the screen to accommodate the expanded score bar intro in 2016. During X Games broadcasts, an X Games logo with the ABC logo over it is used in place of the normal ABC logo. This version is removed during commercial breaks, as the ads run on full screen. = Cold Pizza = Cold Pizza was notable for having its own version of ESPN's BottomLine, as their ticker not only gave sports scores but also news headlines and weather forecasts from sports cities and is shown in its own color scheme. It also functioned differently: it constantly scrolled, while other ESPN \\"BottomLines\\" usually \\"flip\\" through the different scores, scrolling only for long statistical lines (until August 20, 2018, when the bottomline was updated to flip even through long statistical lines, as a result of the bottomline now being two lines rather than one). This graphic was discontinued in the summer of 2006 when the \\"BottomLine\\" was changed to resemble those of other ESPN programs. = College Football Playoff Megacast = The Playoff Megacasts for 2017 introduced a new statistical ticker, which shows info about the current drive, and stats about plays made. Unlike the others, it just fades out stats, instead of flipping. For the 2018 semifinals, a newly redesigned version of the statistical ticker was unveiled. = Defunct Windows PC Ticker = From the Windows 98 era to the middle of the Windows XP era, a BottomLine ticker application using Macromedia Shockwave technology was available for personal use on a Windows personal computer (and was embeddedable with credit as a part of personal websites). Its last update (version 2.1) was in August 2004.

It is closely related to the species Crocodylus anthropophagus, which lived during the same time in Tanzania. C. thorbjarnarsoni could be the largest known true crocodile, with the largest skull found indicating a possible total length up to . It may have been a predator of early hominins. Crocodylus thorbjarnarsoni was named by Christopher Brochu and Glenn Storrs in 2012 in honor of John Thorbjarnarson, a conservationist who worked to protect endangered crocodilians. Description Crocodylus thorbjarnarsoni is distinguished from other crocodiles by its broad snout. It has small raised rims on the prefrontal bones in front of the eyes, a feature also seen in some Nile crocodile individuals. The squamosal bones form raised rims along the sides of the skull table, similar to the crests in C. anthropophagus but much smaller. Also like C. anthropophagus, it has nostrils that open slightly forward rather than directly upward. The largest C. thorbjarnarsoni skull found (KNM-ER 1682) measures from the tip of the snout to the back of the skull table, in comparison, the largest known extant Crocodylus skull is that of a saltwater crocodile, measuring . Based on regression analysis for Crocodylus, this corresponds to a total length of but such analysis have been shown to underestimate the size of very large individuals by as much as 20%, which means it could have been as long as . Paleoecology Crocodylus thorbjarnarsoni likely preyed on human ancestors like Paranthropus and early members of the genus Homo, both of which are known from the Turkana Basin. Direct evidence of crocodilian predation is known from bite marks on hominin bones from the Olduvai Gorge, and these marks were likely made by the closely related crocodile C. anthropophagus (anthropophagus means \\"human eater\\" in Greek). No hominin bones from the Turkana Basin bear crocodilian bite marks, so there is no direct evidence that C. thorbjarnarsoni preyed on hominins. However, modern Nile crocodiles are known to consume adult humans, and since C. thorbjarnarsoni was larger than any Nile crocodile, it easily could have eaten smaller-bodied human ancestors. Brochu and Storrs hypothesized that the lack of bite marks could have been due to hominin's awareness of crocodiles and ability to evade them, explaining that \\"this conflict‚Äîeat and drink, but maybe die‚Äîwas presumably foremost amongst the concerns our predecessors felt when approaching ancient waterways inhabited by Crocodylus thorbjarnarsoni.\\" Another explanation was that C. thorbjarnarsoni may have eaten hominins whole with little need for biting, since it was much larger. Specimens Crocodylus thorbjarnarsoni is known from nine skulls, all of which are housed in the National Museum of Kenya. The holotype is a nearly complete skull and lower jaw called KNM-ER 1683 and comes from the approximately 2-million-year-old Koobi Fora Formation on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana. The skulls KNM-ER 1681 and KNM-ER 1682 have also been found from the formation. Three other skulls are known from the Nachukui Formation, west of the holotype's locality. KNM-WT 38977 is from the 2.5- to 3.4-million-year- old Lower Lomekwi Member, KNM-LT 26305 is from the 3.9-million-year-old Kaiyumung Member, and KNM-LT 421 is from the 4.2- to 5.0-million-year-old Apak Member. Three additional skulls called KNM-KP 18338, KNM-KP 30604, and KNM-KP 30619 are known from the southern Turkana Basin in the Kanapoi Formation, dating between 4.07 and 4.12 million years. KNM-ER 1682, KNM-LT 421, KNM-LT 26305, and KNM-KP 30619 were previously assigned to Rimasuchus lloydi, and their reassignment to C. thorbjarnarsoni reduces the range of R. lloydi to Northern Africa.

It contains a single species, Elaltitan lilloi.  Etymology  Elaltitan was first described and named by Philip D. Mannion and Alejandro Otero in 2012 and the type species is Elaltitan lilloi. The generic name is derived from Elal (pronounced as \\"ee-lal\\") - the god of the Tehuelche people of Chubut Province and titan, giant in Greek mythology. The specific name, lilloi, honors Miguel Lillo, for his contribution and legacy to natural sciences in Tucum√°n.  Discovery  Elaltitan is known only from a single individual, represented by an associated partial postcranial skeleton. The holotype includes both PVL 4628 and MACN-CH 217 comprising three dorsal vertebrae, two caudal vertebrae, left scapula, left humerus, left radius, both ulnae, right pubis, proximal half of right femur, distal part of left tibia, distal two-thirds of left fibula, right astragalus and calcaneum. Elaltitan is the first titanosaur skeleton to preserve an associated calcaneum. Although all of the material was originally housed in the Colecci√≥n de Paleontolog√≠a de Vertebrados de la Fundaci√≥n Instituto Miguel Lillo in Tucum√°n, Argentina and accessioned as PVL 4628, the dorsal vertebrae and complete caudal vertebra were subsequently moved to the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales ‚ÄúBernardino Rivadavia‚Äù in Buenos Aires, where they were accessioned as MACN-CH 217\\\\. The holotype specimen was collected by an expedition of the Fundaci√≥n Miguel Lillo and the Universidad Nacional de Tucum√°n, led by Jos√© Fernando Bonaparte, from the right (southern) bank of the Senguerr River, in the area between the bend of this river and the Pampa de Mar√≠a Sant√≠sima, southeast of the southernmost part of the Sierra de San Bernardo, Chubut Province. It came from the lower member of the Bajo Barreal Formation, dating to the middle Cenomanian to the Turonian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, about 96.5-89.3 million years ago.  Description  The holotype of Elaltitan was originally attributed to Antarctosaurus sp. by Bonaparte & Gasparini (1979), and later tentatively referred to Argyrosaurus by Jaime Powell (1986, 2003). Philip D. Mannion and Alejandro Otero (2012), who named the genus, diagnosed Elaltitan by a unique combination of characters, as well as one autapomorphy. The autapomorphy (unique trait) is the presence of dorsoventrally tall neural arch restricted to anterior half of centrum (excluding condylar ball) in anterior-most caudal vertebrae. Other unusual characters include a spinopostzygapophyseal laminae in middle‚Äìposterior dorsal vertebrae bifurcate into medial and lateral branches, an astragalar ascending process that does not extend to the posterior margin of the astragalus and the presence of a calcaneum. Other potentially unusual features were also listed. These traits distinguish Elaltitan from all other titanosauriforms, including Antarctosaurus and Argyrosaurus, as well as other sauropods from the lower member of the Bajo Barreal Formation, such as Drusilasaura and Epachthosaurus. Based on comparisons with the morphologically similar femur of \\"Antarctosaurus\\" giganteus, which was measured as in length, the complete femur of Elaltitan would be approximately the same size. This makes it one of the largest known sauropods ever to have existed. Mannion & Otero (2012) also pointed out that there are currently 39 Cretaceous South American titanosauriform genera considered to be valid, the majority of which (31) are from Argentina. Its weight has been estimated at in 2014, and at in 2018. However, in 2020 Molina-Perez and Larramendi gave a smaller size of 20 meters (66 ft) and 23 tonnes (25.35 short tons).

It contains a single species, Albertonectes vanderveldei. Albertonectes is the longest elasmosaur, and more generally plesiosaur, known to date both in neck and total body length. Discovery Life restoration Albertonectes is known solely from the holotype TMP 2007.011.0001, a complete well preserved postcranial skeleton housed at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Alberta. Elements include all 132 vertebrae from the atlas-axis complex to fused tip of the tail vertebrae, complete pectoral and incomplete pelvic girdles, almost complete forelimbs and hindlimbs, disarticulated ribs, a gastralium, and at least 97 associated gastroliths. TMP 2007.011.0001 was discovered during mining for gem-quality ammonite shell called Ammolite by Korite International Ltd. about 150 meters south of the St. Mary River near Lethbridge in southern Alberta. The specimen was excavated in a nearly completely articulated state from dark gray claystone in a concretionary horizon about 15 m above the base of the Bearpaw Formation and about 2 m below an ash bed known by mine workers as the \\"10 inch bentonite\\". Collected from the lower part of Muddy Unit 1 of the St. Mary River Section, just below the lowest known local occurrence of Baculites compressus in the formation, the specimen is not younger than about 73.5 million years old and approximately of that age, thus dating to the middle of the upper Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous. The discovery of Albertonectes marks a new record in both neck and total body length among known elasmosaurs, at in postcranial body length ( with skull) and a 7-meter (23-foot) neck. Etymology Albertonectes was first described and named by Tai Kubo, Mark T. Mitchell and Donald M. Henderson in 2012 and the type species is Albertonectes vanderveldei. The generic name is derived from Alberta, in reference to the Canadian province where the holotype was found, and from Greek nectes, meaning \\"swimmer\\", a common suffix for genus names of plesiosaurians. The specific name honors the late Rene Vandervelde, the founder of Korite International, the gem-mining company that discovered the holotype. Description Size of Albertonectes vanderveldei relative to a human Albertonectes has the longest neck of any elasmosaur ever discovered, which reached up to . The holotype, missing the skull, measures at from the atlas-axis complex to the tip of the tail, suggesting a total body length of with the skull. Albertonectes is also unique among other elasmosaurids in having 76 neck vertebrae, a record number among elasmosaurids. Callawayasaurus with a similar count of 56 lacks the dumbbell-shaped articular faces that are present on the vertebrae of Vegasaurus. Additional traits rarely seen in other elasmosaurid include: a tapered front-side projection on the pubis that extends to the side beyond the acetabulum, a longitudinal ridge on the side of most neck vertebrae up to cervical 69, a clavicular arch that is wider than the adjacent front edge of the scapula, the lack of pectoral and pelvic bar, a tip of the tail that is made of seven fused tail vertebrae, and a slender humerus with a width-to- length ratio of 0.56, among other traits. Albertonectes is known from a mature individual, as suggested by the fused neural spines and most cervical ribs to their centra, and by the only partial connection between the trochanter and the capitulum (head) of the femur, seen in TMP 2007.011.0001. Other observation also support an adult age, e.g. rough and wrinkled vertebral surfaces as well as well-developed facets and articulations on its wrist and ankle bones. Phylogeny Kubo et al. (2012) tested the phylogenetic position of Albertonectes using a highly modified version of Sato (2002)'s data-set, however its position wasn't stable and many elasmosaurids formed rather large polytomies. This analysis was modified by O‚ÄôGorman et al. (2015), and the cladogram below follows their results, showing only the relationships within Elasmosauridae.

Situated in the middle of the city's central business district, it is a major pedestrian thoroughfare and commercial district. Retail shops, chic restaurants, lofts, office space, and theaters line Houston from the Alamo to Santa Rosa, giving the street its famously eclectic and fashionable reputation. History The history of Houston Street is often framed through its relationship with its sister thoroughfare two blocks south: Commerce Street. The two streets serve as part of the east-west backbone of the central business district, with Commerce oriented more towards vehicular traffic and Houston being among the most pedestrian-dense corridors in the city. =Early History (1718 to 1870)= The road now known as \\"Houston\\" was originally called \\"Rivas Street\\" east of the river and \\"El Paseo del Rio\\" west of it.

The Alameda was the city's most important thoroughfare, as it connected the two town squares: Alamo Plaza and Main Plaza. For the first century and a half of its existence, this road prospered as the city's main street and center of gravity. However, by the late 19th century, Commerce Street had become overburdened by grime, congestion, and the stench of mule and horse-drawn vehicles. =Growth and Prosperity (1871 to 1969)= The Maverick family ‚Äî one of the city's wealthiest and most well-connected political families ‚Äî owned a significant amount of property along Rivas Street. In 1871, the newly- modernized road was renamed \\"Houston Street\\", four years after the Alameda's transformation into \\"Commerce Street\\". Due in large part to less commercial and vehicular activity along the street, Houston was a much cleaner avenue than that of its southerly sister, a fact that the Maverick family was keen on advertising.

It is known from a single holotype incomplete, partially disarticulated skull and left lower jaw called PEFO 34034 from the Upper Lot's Wife beds, Sonsela Member of the Chinle Formation in Petrified Forest National Park. The skull was discovered in 2004 and described as a specimen of Smilosuchus adamanensis (then a species of Leptosuchus). It was placed in the new genus Protome in 2012. The genus name Protome is the Greek word for an animal's face. The specific name batalaria is the Latin word for battleship, which is a reference to Battleship NW, the locality within Petrified Forest where the skull was found. Description Protome has a long, narrow, tubular-shaped snout. It has a partial rostral crest at the back of the snout, a feature which it shares with phytosaurs like Smilosuchus adamanensis, Pravusuchus, and Leptosuchus, but which is not as prominent as it is in other Smilosuchus species and some Pseudopalatus species. It lacks the premaxillary crest along the midline of the snout that is present in Leptosuchus studeri and Mystriosuchus westphali. Many characteristics that associate Protome with other phytosaurs can be found in its squamosal bone, which makes up the cheek region and extends behind the main portion of the skull. Protome was named on the basis of several unique characteristics, or autapomorphies. The first autapomorphy is the flat shape of the basitubera, an area at the base of the skull in front of its attachment point with the neck. Another is that bony projections called exoccipital prongs at the back of the skull make up the top margin of the foramen magnum, the hole through which the spinal cord enters the skull. A third autapomorphy is a small depression or fossa surrounding the front tip of a hole in the lower jaw called the mandibular fenestra. These features were used to distinguish PEFO 34034 as a new genus and species, distinct from Leptosuchus adamanensis. Protome and Leptosuchus are similar in that both have broad squamosals and holes called supratemporal fenestrae that are located on top of the skull. When it was described in 2004, PEFO 34034 was thought to represent a small Leptosuchus individual, possibly a juvenile. The lack of a premaxillary crest has been used as evidence for it being a juvenile, although the absence of a crest has also been interpreted as a distinct characteristic of some species, and more recently as a possible characteristic of sexual dimorphism. Most juvenile phytosaurs are identified on the basis of incomplete fusion of different parts of each vertebra, but Protome is not known from any postcranial remains. Phylogeny When Protome was named in 2012, a phylogenetic analysis was conducted to determine its evolutionary relationships. The analysis placed PEFO 34034 outside the clades containing species of Leptosuchus and Smilosuchus, the two most likely genera to which the specimen could be referred. PEFO 34034's placement outside these groups justified the erection of a new genus and species. Protome was found to be a phytosaurid just outside the clade Leptosuchomorpha. As was the case in previous studies, species of Leptosuchus formed a paraphyletic grouping, meaning that they did not represent one coherent genus. Many isolated phytosaur skull fragments from Petrified Forest have been assigned to Leptosuchus because they had broad squamosals, but the presence of this type of squamosal in the distinct taxon Protome suggests that not all of these fragments can be assigned with confidence to Leptosuchus.

It is an organisms ability to overcome certain circumstances in order to develop normally. This can be either a physical or mental circumstance that interferes with either a physical or mental trait. Many species have a specific norm, where those who fit that norm prosper while those who don't are killed or find it difficult to thrive. It is important that the animal be able to interact with the other group members effectively. Animals must learn their species' norms early to live a normal, successful life for that species. Developmental homeostasis determines how a species adapts to live a normal life. Therefore, it has been the focus of many experiments. These experiments are geared and designed to test the threshold for certain species to overcome and prosper despite certain circumstances. Due to the fact that survival of the species is based on the ability to interact with their own in a normal manner, these experiments‚Äîwhich usually interfere with that‚Äîwalk a fine line for animal rights and what is acceptable. The rhesus monkey experiments show how the young monkey needs the physical contact with other monkeys to learn the social behaviors and interact with each other effectively. This is one of the ways mental developmental homeostasis has been researched. One way physical developmental homeostasis was tested was in the facial symmetry experiment where people were asked to rate which of the faces they saw as better looking. This experiment resulted in the pictures with more symmetrical faces being called better looking. This is not just found in humans but other experiments such as the brush-legged wolf spider and the barn swallow birds. Favored traits give the bearer an advantage in attracting high quality mates. In species that value developmental homeostasis, both physically and mentally, the ability of one to adapt to social norms seems to increase the likelihood of having a reproductive advantage being able to attract mates and leave offspring. Developmental homeostasis: isolation of monkeys Developmental homeostasis attributes to the way many animals develop. This contains the way they develop normally or abnormally despite faulty genes and an insufficient environment. This property of development reduces the variation around a mean value for a phenotype, and reflects the ability of developmental processes to suppress some outcomes in order to generate an adaptive phenotype more reliably. =Effects of social isolation in rhesus monkeys= The effects of developmental homeostasis were demonstrated in an experiment conducted four decades ago by Margaret and Harry Harlow. They wanted to test what the consequences of infant rhesus monkeys would be from being separated from their mothers and having little interaction with other monkeys. First, they were separated from their mothers for six to twelve hours after birth and placed with a human made mechanical substitute in which they called the \\"surrogate mother.\\" These surrogates were made of a wire cylinder structure and a terry cloth structure and were placed with the babies is a cage. The terry cloth structure was also placed with a nursing bottle. The monkeys preferred and clung to the cloth surrogate mother. In a short period of time the monkeys took on side effects of weight loss and not abnormal physical development. Once the monkeys reached an age where they could eat solid foods, they were separated from their cloth mothers for three days. When they were reunited with their mothers, they clung to them and did not wander off. Young rhesus monkeys in their natural habitat normally explore and venture off. Harlow concluded from this that the need for contact comfort was stronger than the need to explore. Being isolated from social interaction also caused negative outcomes later in their life. The surrogate-raised monkeys exhibited depression and aggressive behavior as they would clutch to themselves, rock constantly back and forth, and avoid interaction with others. Not only affecting their social behavior, it also impacted them interacting sexually. The monkeys underwent little if any sexual posturing or reproduction in their lifetime. To test how much social experience is necessary or needed in normal development the Harlows performed another experiment in that they isolated young rhesus monkeys by limiting the interaction time with other monkeys. They gave them fifteen minutes a day with three other monkeys to interact. In the beginning, the monkeys would attach to each other and begin to play. Normal behavior of these monkeys in their natural habitat is that after the age of one month they play with other monkeys of their own species and by six months are constantly interacting in groups. Results showed that over time the monkeys developed relatively normal behavior and that limiting their social interaction as babies did not affect them interacting sexually and socially. They also did not exhibit any abnormal aggression or depression when socializing with other monkeys. In 1960, Harry Harlow began studying partial and total isolation of infant monkeys by raising them in cages. Partial isolation involved raising monkeys in bare wire cages that allowed them to see, smell, and hear other monkeys, but did not give them the opportunity for physical contact. Total social isolation involved rearing monkeys in isolation chambers that took away any and all contact with other monkeys. The results showed that when the monkeys were placed in partial isolation they displayed various abnormal behaviors such as blank staring, circling in their cages numerous times, and self-mutilation. The cages were placed in several locations. A few of the monkeys remained being tested in solitary confinement for fifteen years. In the total isolation experiments the baby monkeys were left alone for three, six, twelve, or twenty-four months. The experiments resulted in the monkeys that were severely psychologically disturbed and abnormal development. When first removed from isolation, they usually went into emotional shock by clutching to themselves and rocking multiple times. One of six monkeys isolated for three months refused to eat after release and died five days later. The longer the time in isolation the more detrimental it was for the monkeys to act socially when placed with other monkeys. Harlow pointed out that no monkey had actually died during isolation. Harlow tried to reintegrate the monkeys who had been isolated for six months by placing them with monkeys who had been reared normally. He stated that it produced ‚Äúsevere deficits in virtually every aspect of social behavior‚Äù and that it ‚Äúachieved only limited recovery of simple social responses.‚Äù =Ethics= The ethics of pulling a baby primate away from their mother at young ages isn't morally right. Removing baby primates from their mothers can cause high psychological trauma in these young primates that can inhibit proper growth and social skills. In addition to lasting effects, these animals may live in small, cramped, dirty environments, which can cause health issues within baby primates. Health problems can also arise sooner and with more impact on a young primate that has just been removed from the comfort of their mother because their immune system is not fully active as it would be with an older primate. The psychological effects of the physiological suffering of these young primates last a lifetime.Judy Cameron‚Äôs maternal- deprivation and psychological- development experiments. (2012). ONPRC laboratories: A nightmare for monkeys. Retrieved from PETA website: http://www.peta.org/features/onprc-researchers.aspx Overall, questions arise about animal experimentation being morally right or wrong. Labs that abuse the ability to conduct animal experimentation are often shut down or lose federal funding, University of Pennsylvania's lab is a good example of this. Some statistics about animal experimentation: 20 million animals are experimented on and are killed annually, an estimated 8 million are experimented on painfully, and reports have shown that ten percent of those tested on do not receive pain killers to minimize the pain these animals are put through. Animal experimentation has become something that is debated about publicly. Those who do not believe in animal experimentation raise the questions about if it is wrong to cause pain to humans then isn't it wrong to cause pain to animals? Andre, C., & Velasquez, M. (2010).

Retrieved from Markkula Center for Applied Ethics website: http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/iie/v1n3/cures.html Some advocates of animal experimentation that say that these experiments allow scientific discovery to advance‚Äîbut some feel that those who support animal experimentation are selfish to inflict pain on other animals as a method to reduce or eliminate pain for humans. The question is not so much a comparison between the pain of humans versus the pain of animals as much as it is the amount of suffering for the animal subjects.DEWEY, J. (2012).

Retrieved from HE ATLANTIC MONTHLY GROUP website: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/ 1926/09/the-ethics-of-animal- experimentation/5429/2/ Developmental homeostasis in symmetry and asymmetry Developmental homeostasis plays a role in the development of symmetrical and asymmetrical bodies. This effect in species shows that individuals in species who have symmetrical features are more likely to obtain a mate over one who has asymmetrical features. =Symmetry in facial features= The symmetry in the facial features of humans could be found as appealing to men and women. This could be due to the ability to find prospective mates in responding positively to either body or facial symmetry. This could be because attributes announce the individual's capacity to overcome challenges to normal development. The human preference for symmetry can be explained by humans looking at mate choice, mainly because symmetry is a reliable indicator in the genetic quality mates look for. The cognitive mechanisms and adaptive significance of facial attractiveness have been an interest of psychologists. Men and women find traits such as averageness, symmetry, and masculinity (in male) or femininity (in female) in faces attractive. It is noted that humans find symmetrical faces more attractive than asymmetrical faces. Disruptions to development caused by mutations or by an inability to secure critical material resources early in life could generate asymmetries in appearance. If body asymmetry reflects sub-optimal development of the brain or other important organs, a preference for symmetrical traits could enable the selective individual to acquire a partner with \\"good genes\\" to transfer to their offspring. Disruptions to development could be caused by stress, illness, or genetic factors. =Symmetry vs. asymmetry= Symmetry of female and male faces. Those with high symmetry appear more attractive than low. In 1998 a study of facial symmetry and how beauty was experimented on by Gillian Rhodes called \\"Facial symmetry and the perception of beauty\\". In the experiment, images of human faces were digitally manipulated to show various amounts of symmetry. People were asked to rate the faces, and found that the faces with the most symmetry were the most attractive. =Reproductive advantages= Developmental homeostasis is present not only in humans, but in animals as well. The choosing of symmetrical features over asymmetrical features have been observed in birds, lizards, Araneae, and even insects. For example, barn swallow females have been reported to prefer males whose long outer feathers are the same length on each side. Symmetrical males gain a reproductive advantage because of the female mate choice. Another example is the behavior exhibited in the damselfly Lestes viridis, where males with more symmetrical hindwings were mated with more than their unmated rivals with asymmetrical hindwings. These examples show that individuals with high quality features are able to reproduce their large and symmetrical traits, while individuals who have lower quality features suffer costs to produce their asymmetrical traits. One species that chooses their mates based on body symmetry is the brush-legged wolf spider. Males who have larger tufts on one leg than the other (asymmetrical) tend to be smaller, and have poorer fitness than the males who have symmetrical tufts. During courtship, the males wave their hair foreleg tufts, and symmetrical males be chosen over asymmetrical males by the females.

It was released for Microsoft Windows and OS X in April 2014, with versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S planned. It is a part of the Elder Scrolls series. The game is set in the continent of Tamriel and features a storyline indirectly connected with the other games in the Elder Scrolls franchise. It had been in development for seven years before its release in 2014. It initially received mixed reviews, but these improved significantly with the re-release and rebranding as The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited, with critics praising the changes that were made. The Elder Scrolls Online originally used a mandatory monthly subscription model until it transitioned in March 2015 to a buy-to-play model with microtransactions and an optional subscription. The game was renamed The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited, and was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles in June 2015. The game sold more than 16 million copies by 2020, having around 2.5 million monthly active players. Gameplay Gameplay is mostly non-linear, with a mixture of quests, random events, and free-roaming exploration of the world. The game does not provide a mode for single-player offline play, although the developers stated that there would be \\"plenty of content\\" designed to accommodate players who prefer to play solo. The player is able to play as ten different races: * Humans: Nords, Redguards, Bretons, and Imperials * Elvish races: Dunmer (Dark Elves), Altmer (High Elves), Bosmer (Wood Elves), and Orsimer (Orcs) * Bestial races: Khajiit and Argonians Players must choose one of six classes when creating their character: Dragonknight, Sorcerer, Nightblade, Templar, Warden, or Necromancer. Each class gives the player various different attacks, spells, and passive effects. The game has other character choices beyond those of race and class, such as the player character also being able to become either a vampire or a werewolf, each of which grants its own skill tree. There are seven different crafting skill lines: Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Clothier, Enchanting, Woodworking, Provisioning, and Jewelry Crafting. Setting The game is set on the continent of Tamriel during the Second Era, but not all places in Tamriel are playable. The events of the game occur a millennium before those of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and around 800 years before The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Its structure is broadly similar to Skyrim, with two separate conflicts progressing at the same time, one with the fate of the world in the balance, and one where the prize is supreme power on Tamriel. In The Elder Scrolls Online, the first struggle is against the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, who is attempting to meld the plane of Mundus with his realm of Coldharbour, and the second is to capture the vacant imperial throne, contested by three alliances of the mortal races. The player character has been sacrificed to Molag Bal, and Molag Bal has stolen their soul, the recovery of which is the primary game objective. Many parts of the continent of Tamriel are available in the game, with most zones accessible regardless of faction or player level. Some zones are accessible with DLC-only from the Crown Store or by subscribing to ESO. Players have the opportunity to join any of the three factions warring over the Ruby Throne of the Emperor of Tamriel: the First Aldmeri Dominion (represented by an eagle) led by Queen Ayrenn, composed of the Altmer (High Elf), Bosmer (Wood Elf), and Khajiit races; the Daggerfall Covenant (represented by a lion) led by High King Emeric, composed of the Bretons, Redguard, and Orsimer (Orcs); and the Ebonheart Pact (represented by a dragon) led by Jorunn Skald-King, composed of the Nord, Dunmer (Dark Elf), and Argonian races. Players may also unlock the Imperial race by purchasing the Digital Imperial Edition Upgrade in the Crown Store, which may be a part of any of the three factions. The other major ruling faction of Tamriel is the Empire, led by Empress Regent Clivia Tharn, which has fallen into instability and disrepair and serves as a non-joinable faction. Pre-ordered copies of the game included the \\"Explorers' Pack\\" which allowed all races to be played in each of the factions, and this feature is also available in the Crown Store. The game begins in the Wailing Prison in Coldharbour, where the player character's soulless husk (known as a soul shriven) has been enslaved. This opening continues another Elder Scrolls tradition of beginning the game with the player as a prisoner. After escaping, the base of operations becomes the Harborage, a cave found at each of the starting cities where the Prophet opens portals to the locations of the main questline. Once the Amulet of Kings is retrieved, the headquarters shift to the Hollow City, a location in central Coldharbour blessed by Meridia. Civilians saved from Coldharbour's prisons arrive in the Hollow City, and it is from there that attacks are orchestrated on Molag Bal's controlled areas. Development The Elder Scrolls Online had been in development for seven years before its release in 2014. It is the first project for ZeniMax Online Studios, which was formed in 2007. Matt Firor, studio lead at ZeniMax Online, is the director of The Elder Scrolls Online.ZeniMax Online licensed the HeroEngine in November 2007. It was used as a whiteboard for the game in early development while the production engine was in development. The game was funded using funds from Providence Equity Partners, as well as the success of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion helped fund the game. While rumors of a massively multiplayer The Elder Scrolls game had been circulating for years, with the first being a domain registration by ZeniMax Media in November 2007 for ElderScrollsOnline.com. Information about the game and its imminent May 2012 announcement was not leaked until March 2012, to online publication Tom's Guide by an anonymous industry source. According to the leak, the game was scheduled to be shown at E3 2012 in June and QuakeCon 2012 in August. On November 8, 2012, Bethesda released a video on YouTube called \\"An Introduction to The Elder Scrolls Online\\", in which the game's developers talk about the game's content and development. Several actors were announced to voice the characters of The Elder Scrolls Online, among them John Cleese, Bill Nighy, Kate Beckinsale, Lynda Carter, Alfred Molina, Michael Gambon, Jennifer Hale, Malcolm McDowell, and Peter Stormare. Beta sign-ups for The Elder Scrolls Online began on January 21, 2013, and continued for seven rounds until February 26. In June 2013, Sony announced that The Elder Scrolls Online would be available on PlayStation 4 at their E3 press conference. It was later clarified by Bethesda that it would also be available on Xbox One. While players on Windows and Mac play together, those on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 play only with others on the same platform. In August 2013, at gamescom, it was announced that The Elder Scrolls Online would have a monthly subscription fee upon release for all platforms. Subscriptions could be purchased in 30-, 90-, and 180-day increments. While it was announced in January 2014 that the game would not require a PlayStation Plus subscription to play online, the Xbox One version would require an Xbox Live Gold subscription in addition to a The Elder Scrolls Online monthly subscription. On May 8, 2014, Bethesda spoke about development of the console editions, announcing that the release date for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game would be delayed until the end of 2014, though it was revealed in December 2014 that the game's console debut was once again delayed into the Spring of 2015. ZeniMax Online Studios announced that players who purchased The Elder Scrolls Online before the end of June 2014 would have the opportunity to transfer their characters from Microsoft Windows or Mac OS to either console platform and receive a free 30-day subscription.

The game was later ported over to Stadia on June 16, 2020. Shortly after the game's launch, it was reported that some players were unable to activate the 30-day complimentary game time included with their purchase until a subscription had been set up and‚Äîin \\"a strange state of affairs\\" and \\"most likely a mistake\\"‚Äîafter a full month had been paid for. A serious item duplication exploit was discovered that allowed players to gain huge fortunes, which was patched shortly after release. ZeniMax later announced that they had permanently banned thousands of accounts because of the exploit. =Tamriel Unlimited= A subscription is no longer needed to play the game since March 17, 2015. Aside from the initial game price, an optional subscription called \\"ESO Plus\\" grants access to all current and future downloadable content (DLC) and a monthly allotment of 1650 Crowns, one of the in-game currencies, as long as the player stays subscribed. The subscription also grants perks that allow players to progress 10% faster than a free player. =Gold Edition= On July 6, 2016, ZeniMax announced the release of a \\"Gold Edition\\" of The Elder Scrolls Online for September 9, 2016. The Gold Edition includes the base game and a certain vanity item, as well as the four major DLCs: Imperial City, Orsinium, Thieves Guild, and Dark Brotherhood.

Eurogamer Dan Whitehead reviewed the game, saying that \\"For fans eager for a new fix all these years on from Skyrim, that may well be enough. The ability to share the adventure, somewhat clumsily, with friends is both a selling point and a pitfall, but those who concentrate their efforts on the Alliance War will find the experience worthwhile.\\" =Sales and user base= The Elder Scrolls Online was the top-selling game in the United Kingdom for the week of April 5, 2014, for individual formats, and number two across all formats. When the game was released on consoles, the game once again became the top-selling game in the United Kingdom for the week of June 15, 2015, across all formats, becoming the year's second best-selling game at retail The game was ranked the best-selling digital PlayStation 4 game of June 2015 in the United States and Europe.

He was married to Evelina Danby, who is generally accepted to be the illegitimate daughter of J.M.W. Turner and his mistress Sarah Danby (1766‚Äì1861). Together, they had seven children: Son: name unknown (1819-c1819), Daughter: Evelina Sarah Margaritta Dupuis(1821-c1821?), Son: William Dupuis (1823-c1823?), Daughter: Rosalie Adelaide Dupuis (1825‚Äì1900), Son: Joseph Hutton Dupuis (1827‚Äì1903), Son: Hanmer Lewis Dupuis (1829‚Äì1911), Daughter: Evelina Louisa Dupuis (1832-after 1875). Joseph Dupuis was a man of the highest reputation among his peers. He devoted much of his life to freeing Christian slaves in North Africa, and was regarded as one of the leading experts of his time on Morocco and the Sahara.  Posting to Mogador  Part of the British Vice Consul's duties at Mogadore involved the redemption of British Nationals and other Christians (usually shipwrecked sailors) from slavery under the terms of an Anglo/Moroccan treaty. The British Consul at Mogador was well known for paying high prices to free Christian slaves in North Africa. Upon learning of a wreck involving Christian sailors, Dupuis would send a Moroccan staff member to attempt to locate the crew, who were usually enslaved shortly after reaching shore, as Christian slaves were sought after by Moors and Africans alike. This employee of the Consul would negotiate the terms of their redemption from their master, usually by paying for their freedom or trading for them. During his tenure as British Vice-Consul in Mogador, Dupuis secured the freedom of many Christian sailors from the hardships of slavery, and in many cases, death. This work was later carried out by his successor in the post. Dupuis partnered a successful mercantile establishment that was engaged in trading between Mogador and Great Britain with William Willshire. When Dupuis returned to Britain in August 1814 he recommended Willshire to take over as British Vice Consul in Mogador, a recommendation that was accepted by the Foreign Office in London.Riley, James; Evans, Gordon H (2001) Sufferings in Africa, Long Riders Guild Press, p.298, .  Involvement with Robert Adams  Not all Christians were ransomed shortly after their arrival in North Africa, and Dupuis is most remembered for his liberation of the American Robert Adams after Adams suffered for three years as a Barbary captive. Upon making note of Adams in his historical record on October 6, 1813, Dupuis wrote that \\"Like most other Christians after a long captivity and severe treatment among the Arabs, he appeared on his first arrival exceedingly stupid and insensible; and he scarcely spoke to anyone.\\" Adams remained with Dupuis in Mogador for seven months, during which time he was able to recover from the hardship of his life as a Barbary slave. Adams later ended up in London, where he told the full story of his experience as a Barbary slave in The Narrative of Robert Adams, published in 1816. Before Adams' Narrative was published, Dupuis fully corroborated all parts of the story where he was concerned. Dupuis was completely satisfied as to the veracity of Adams' Narrative and was one of Adams' strongest supporters when the book received criticism in Europe.  Later life  After subsequent postings in North Africa he left the Consular Service apparently under a cloud. Tradition says that he and his wife became involved in the marble trade in Greece. After the death of J.M.W. Turner they retired to England and Joseph applied unsuccessfully to be curator of Turner's gallery. They settled in Lambeth, where his brother's family lived. Earlier he had collaborated on a book on the Holy Places with his younger son. Both sons entered the Consular Service and had children.Whittingham, Selby, Of Geese, Mallard and Drakes: Some Notes on Turner's Family, 1993 and later editions; Whittingham, Selby, articles in The Catholic Ancestor Notes Category:1789 births Category:1874 deaths Category:British diplomats ","title":"Joseph Dupuis"},{"id":"35708725","text":"In mathematics, the analytic subgroup theorem is a significant result in modern transcendental number theory. It may be seen as a generalisation of Baker's theorem on linear forms in logarithms. Gisbert W√ºstholz proved it in the 1980s. It marked a breakthrough in the theory of transcendental numbers. Many longstanding open problems can be deduced as direct consequences. Statement If G is a commutative algebraic group defined over an algebraic number field and A is a Lie subgroup of G with Lie algebra defined over the number field then A does not contain any non-zero algebraic point of G unless A contains a proper algebraic subgroup. One of the central new ingredients of the proof was the theory of multiplicity estimates of group varieties developed by David Masser and Gisbert W√ºstholz in special cases and established by W√ºstholz in the general case which was necessary for the proof of the analytic subgroup theorem. Consequences One of the spectacular consequences of the analytic subgroup theorem was the Isogeny Theorem published by Masser and W√ºstholz. A direct consequence is the Tate conjecture for abelian varieties which Gerd Faltings had proved with totally different methods which has many applications in modern arithmetic geometry. Using the multiplicity estimates for group varieties W√ºstholz succeeded to get the final expected form for lower bound for linear forms in logarithms. This was put into an effective form in a joint work of him with Alan Baker which marks the current state of art. Besides the multiplicity estimates a further new ingredient was a very sophisticated use of geometry of numbers to obtain very sharp lower bounds.

The island of Cyprus was situated at a strategically important position along Eastern Mediterranean trade routes, and had been controlled by various imperial powers throughout the first millennium BC. including: the Assyrians, Egyptians, Macedonians, and eventually the Romans. Cyprus was annexed by the Romans in 58 BC, but turbulence and civil war in Roman politics did not establish firm rule in Cyprus until 31 BC when Roman political struggles ended by Battle of Actium, and after about a decade, Cyprus was assigned a status of senatorial province in 22 BC. From then on to the 7th century Cyprus was controlled by the Romans. Cyprus officially became part of the Eastern Roman Empire in 293 AD.Ancient History Encyclopedia - Antonios Loizides. Ancient.eu Under Roman rule, Cyprus was divided into four main districts, Salamis, Paphos, Amathus, and Lapethos. Paphos was the capital of the island throughout the Roman period until Salamis was re-founded as Constantia in 346 AD. The geographer Ptolemy recorded the following Roman cities: Paphos, Salamis, Amathous, Lapethos, Kition, Kourion, Arsinoe, Kyrenia, Chytri, Karpasia, Soli, and Tamassos, as well as some smaller cities scattered throughout the island.

Ptolemy X Alexander I bequeathed his kingdom, which at the time included Egypt and Cyprus, to the Roman Republic upon his death in 88 BC. However, the Roman Senate was reluctant to accept the kingdom as it was feared that whoever was sent to conquer the Ptolemaic Kingdom might become too powerful and threaten the democratic principles of the Republic. King Ptolemy, son of the King of Egypt Ptolemy IX Lathyros, reigned over Cyprus from 88 to 58 BC. After Ptolemy refused to put up ransom when Publius Clodius Pulcher was kidnapped by Cilician pirate, Pulcher accused the king of colluding with pirates. This accusation provided a pretext for the annexation of Cyprus by the Roman Republic. The Lex Clodia de Cyprus was passed by the Concilium Plebis in 58 BC and Cato was sent to conquer Cyprus and serve as its new proconsul. Cato sent envoys ahead to offer Ptolemy the distinctive position of the High Priest at the Sanctuary of Aphrodite in Paphos but Ptolemy refused and instead took his own life. Cyprus was abruptly annexed by Rome and Cyprus was added to the Roman province of Cilicia. Cato sold much of the royal possessions and brought back 7000 talents to Rome after taking his share of the profits. During this time Cyprus was exploited by the Roman rulers who saw positions in the provinces as stepping stone in Roman politics. In 51 BC Cicero was given the proconsulship in Cyprus and was more sympathetic to the Cypriot people. However, by the end of his proconsulship Rome was engulfed in Caesar's Civil War. In 47 BC, after coming to the aid of Cleopatra VII of Egypt in a civil war against her brother Ptolemy XIII, Julius Caesar agreed to return control of Cyprus to the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Caesar appointed Cleopatra's younger siblings Arsinoe IV and Ptolemy XIV as joint rulers of Cyprus. Marc Antony and Octavian, later Augustus, were struggling for power after Julius Caesar's death and in 40 BC Marc Antony reaffirmed that Cleopatra was ruler of Cyprus at the Donations of Alexandria. The Battle of Actium in 31 BC marked the end of last war of the Roman Republic, resulting in Octavian gaining control of all of Egypt and Cyprus. Cyprus was left under control of Octavian's legate until it could be further dealt with. In 22 BC Cyprus was separated from the Cilicia and became a senatorial province without a standing army.  Overview  Cyprus was divided into four regions with thirteen known cities with Nea Paphos becoming the capital. Cyprus was allowed a large amount of autonomy remaining mainly Greek in culture while adopting and adapting Roman customs. No Roman colonies were settled on the island. During this time period there are very few primary literary sources that mention Cyprus, let alone provide a detailed history. However, epigraphic and archaeological evidence indicates thriving economic, culture and civic life in Cyprus throughout the Roman period. In 45 AD Saint Paul and Saint Barnabas visited Cyprus as part of Paul's first missionary journey to convert the people to Christianity. St. Barnabas returned for a second visit in 49 AD but the spread of Christianity was slow, especially in the rural areas. After the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD by Vespasian, the Roman Emperor, and his son Titus there was a large influx of Jewish refugees into Cyprus. In 115-117 AD a widespread Jewish revolt (Kitos War) resulted in thousands of deaths in Cyprus and around the Eastern Empire and in the expulsion of Jews from Cyprus. In 269 AD there was a brief Gothic invasion (Battle of Naissus) throughout the eastern empire including Cyprus. In 293 AD Cyprus became part of the Eastern Empire as the Roman Empire was divided under the Diocletianic reforms. = Roman military on Cyprus = There was very little significant Roman military presence on Cyprus, with the exception of two notable incidents; a local council was barricaded into their own council house by an equestrian troop and the Jewish massacre at Salamis which required outside military intervention. The proconsul had a legatus subordinate, which points to at least a token military presence, but there is almost no evidence of there being anything larger than the praetorian bodyguards on the island. Every province of the Roman Empire was required to send men to fill the ranks of the Roman army as conscripts and Cyprus was no exception. The Cypriots contributed some 2000 men to the foreign auxilia at any one time, but there are no notable military figures from Cyprus. There are two cohorts of auxiliary troops that performed well enough to be given the honor of citizenship before their 25 years of service was up, but other than those there is no other known outstanding Cypriot units. = Roman administrative system = The Roman administrative system was also fairly light; it seems that only unfavored citizens were sent to govern the island. The basic structure consisted of a proconsul at the top representing the Roman Senate and the emperor with two assistants in the form of a legatus and a quaestor. The proconsul had several duties, including: *High court judicial duties; if the magistrate and the local council couldn't rule on it, it was brought to the proconsul *investing the high priest (of the Imperial cult) with his power as the representative for the emperor *consecrating Imperial statues and buildings in the name of the emperor *he promoted public and civic (construction) works such as aqueducts, roads, and centers of entertainment (such as theaters) *it was his responsibility to decide on funding for \\"extravagant projects\\" such as honorary equestrian statues or repaving sanctuaries *he was also responsible for the internal security of the island The Cypriots were essentially peaceful; there is no mention of outlaws needing to be dealt with or crimes severe enough to need police intervention, there was no real policing force on the island for the proconsul to oversee. The closest thing to a police force was a hipparch in office in Soli under Hadrian's rule, but this seems to have been a temporary situation. Under the proconsul and the legate were the local councils; these were led by archons who were elected annually from among the members of the council. There were several other positions associated with the councils, but they are all local officials and not directly part of the Roman administrative structure. The quaestor handled tax collection on the island; he had a board of ten Cypriots in each city to help him with his duties. In addition to this force, there were publicani who would bid for the right to collect taxes in each region. The terms of office for the proconsul and the legate were staggered with that of the quaestor, that is to say the proconsul and the legate would see the last six months of the old quaestor's term and the first six months of the new one's term. Economy and trade = Economy = The Roman period was one of the most prosperous in Cyprus' history. Evidence of luxury items acquired through trade, impressively large administrative buildings in cities like Salamis, and richly decorated mansion homes like those found in Paphos point to a thriving economy. The island was mostly self- sufficient and prospered through the utilization and trade of natural resources. After the Romans annexed Cyprus in 58 B.C., it entered into a period of production and widespread trade facilitated by the pax romana. This is shown in the archaeological evidence of the coastal cities flourishing, Cypriot markets in Syria and Palestine, and extensive coin circulation. The City was the basic economic unit of the Roman Empire; it could interact with its surrounding agricultural hinterland in one of two ways. In the first, a sort of symbiotic relationship, the city would act as a redistribution center and manufactured goods needed by the agricultural area supporting it. In the second, a more parasitic relationship, the city center would redistribute agricultural surplus while manufacturing goods to be sold or traded with other centers. The role of the city was determined by its proximity to an important trade route. The major coastal cities of Cyprus which showed this kind of economic growth were Paphos, Amathous, and Salamis. The Roman emphasis on the importance of cities was indicated by its dedication to constructing a network of roads. In Cyprus, roads were initially funded by the Emperor, but the island soon grew rich enough to finance its own construction in the period of Severan dynasty. The great wealth of Cyprus came from its vast system of trade. Cypriot trade economy was based on resources of the island: wine, oil, grain, copper, minerals, timber, glass, and shipbuilding. With the port cities acting as distribution centers, Cyprus had connections with other locations across the Mediterranean, and seafaring was an important aspect of Cypriot daily life and culture. The extent of trade can be proven archaeologically through the wide array of foreign items found on the island, particularly coins. Despite the destruction caused by six earthquakes that wracked the island in the Roman period, the Cypriot economy remained relatively steady. The role of the port cities in trade were crucial to the Roman administration; after an earthquake in AD 76 destroyed the city of Kourion, Imperial Rome sent immense amounts of funding to rebuild the city, as evidenced by a large influx of coins in the following year. = Roads = Ancient roads can be studied through literary, epigraphic (e.g. milestones), topographical, and archaeological evidence. The division of Cyprus into two, the buffer zone and military occupied areas make many parts of the island unavailable for study. It is estimated that 10% of the island is inaccessible for various reasons. Studying the Roman road system and its milestones helps in partially establishing the boundaries of territories in Cyprus. There are several sources that can be used to get information about Cyprus' ancient roads. The Geography of Strabo (23 AD) gives several distances and mentions the highway between Palaiaphos and Neo Paphos. Pliny the Elder, in Natural History (77-79 AD) talks about the size of Cyprus and lists fifteen cities, including three no longer extant. The Tabula Peutingeriana (Peutinger Table) is a 13th-century AD copy of an older map of Roman Cyprus. The exact date of the original Peutinger Table is unknown, but is estimated to be from the 2nd to 4th century BC. It is an illustrated version of an itinerary, which is a list of notable places with descriptions and the distances between each place. The map is distorted, north-south is compressed and east-west is stretched out. The roads on Cyprus are shown as an oval which is bisected by a diagonal section of the road. No other roads are depicted. The Geography of Claudius Ptolemy also talks about Cyprus but the accuracy of this information varies for different areas of Cyprus. For example, some distances are overestimated, underestimated, or come very close to reality. Ptolemy doesn't mention any roads. Another map is the Kitchener map (1885). It is useful because it helps to distinguish older roads from the twentieth century roads. There are also travellers' reports and local informants. Claude D. Cobham compiled travellers' reports and descriptions in Excepta Cypria (1918). There are also the works of Luigi de Palma Cesnola and D.G. Hogarth, both of whom used local informants. Their works are useful because it has information about Cyprus during its late Ottoman stage, before the British changed anything. Milestones are an important source because they give route information and they can be dated. Thirty Roman milestones have been found and recorded. Most of them were in mountainous regions and all are located in the coastal highway circling the island. In other areas of the island, where building materials were scarce, milestones were reused. Milestone inscriptions included the mileage and the names and titles of the rulers that contributed to the milestone placement. From these inscriptions other types of information can be inferred. For example, we know that the major road along the southern coast was a part of the Imperial network. Mitford uses the inscriptions to describe the Emperors' and other government involvement in the roads. He says that three phases of the Roman Cyprus road network emerges from the inscriptions. First, Augustus and Titus are the self-proclaimed creators of the road system. Second, in the Severan period the responsibility of road repairs was given to cities while the proconsul coordinated their activities. The third phase was a century and a half of stagnation and milestones were reused for Imperial propaganda or to express loyalty. In the Roman Empire, roads were open for everyone to travel. People traveled on foot, by two and four-wheeled vehicles, or by horse and donkey. In the ancient world, where very few people had maps, roads offered predictability and a guarantee that there were no natural obstacles ahead, which usually meant long detours. Traveling on a road also meant greater speed and the possibility of encountering inns, shrines, and springs. Before the Roman period Cyprus already had a system of main roads and during Roman rule secondary roads were added. The roads in Cyprus often did not meet Roman standards and preexisting roads were not changed to meet them. Although, milestone inscriptions indicate renovations in AD 198, at least in West Cyprus. During the Severan period road maintenance was a civic duty. Throughout the Roman period it is uncertain if the central government paid for the roads completely or shared the costs with nearby cities. Informal cross- country roads were used in addition to the formal roads. The roads converged on the main economic center, Salamis. Along with the main roads, minor roads radiated from a city. This layout shows the influence of economic forces in creating roads. These minor roads connected the surrounding areas to the urban market. There were also the benefits of ensuring the import of food into cities, thus reducing the risk of famine. = Coinage = Although the minting and circulation of Cypriot coins has not yet been exhaustively studied, there is sufficient evidence to show widespread trade routes and interaction with other cultures in the Roman world. There are two main types of evidence in coinage: coins minted in or for Cyprus, and all coins circulating within the province during Roman times. After 30 B.C. the nature of coinage became more \\"Romanized\\"; coin type and manufacture did not remain static over time, and styles and imagery of coins changed frequently. Provincial coins were minted at Paphos and Salamis, as well as \\"regal\\" coins specific to each reigning Emperor in his time. The Koinon was responsible for the coinage, as well as the emperor cult and organization of festivals. For a detailed compilation of each type of coin for each Emperor during this period. = Copper = Copper mining in Cyprus has an extensive history which flourished in the Bronze Age and continued into the Roman Period. The extent of copper mining in the Roman Period was scaled down significantly, and were under direct imperial control. The three important cities that continued copper mining in the classical period were Amathous, Tamassos, and Soli. The well-preserved mining site located near Soli was Skouriotissa, which contains chaclopyrite deposits that were extensively mined during Roman Period. Recent analysis and location of slag heaps from Roman mines suggests a shift in the social organization of mining in classical times. Some slag heaps were located almost 2 miles away from the mining location suggesting that the copper workers transported the copper ore away from the mines before they decided to smelt the copper out and work with it. This is a significant change from earlier mining settlements in which the copper was melted on site or very near the place where it was extracted. Religion and social history = Koinon = In order to maintain some degree of autonomy after control of the island shifted to the Roman Empire, the various cities of Cyprus maintained a collective administrative body that reflected Hellenistic values introduced by the Ptolemaic dynasty at the end of the 4th century. Under the Ptolemies, the cities of Cyprus were allowed a degree of autonomy that was unfamiliar and somewhat unexpected. In order to maintain solidarity throughout the kingdom, the cities formed parliamentary committees with each other. Though the resulting confederation of Cypriot cities does not have an exact date of origin, the term Koinon‚Äîmeaning \\"common\\"‚Äîbegan to appear on inscriptions around the middle of the 2nd century B.C. Little is known about the exact function of the Koinon, though it seems to have been grounded in religion due to its initial associations with religious festivals at the Temple of Aphrodite, which was located at Palaiaphos. The large number of people that gathered at the Temple likely realized a need for religious unity amongst all of them; thus, the Koinon was formed to coordinate pancyprian religious festivals. Soon, the meetings of the Koinon began to stray from strictly religious matters and focus more on the social and political aspects of the country, including unifying the various districts and cities in terms of political representation. These assumptions are based on inscriptions on statues and other dedicatory epigraphical evidence around the island that implies that the Koinon had a presence all over Cyprus, as well as the money and influence to affect many different cities. Thus, the purpose of the Koinon shifted from autonomous parliamentary committees during the Hellenistic period to a religiously motivated pancyprian political body. The administrative privileges of the Koinon, by the end of the Roman period, included minting its own coins, participating in political relations with Rome, and bestowing honorary distinctions upon notable individuals. Inscriptions on statues, as previously mentioned, attest to this final function and indicate the fact that the Koinon was most likely a funded organization which received its dues in the form of an annual contribution from each city. The Koinon therefore maintained a great deal of power because it essentially controlled all forms of religion on the entirety of Cyprus. This power is later utilized to deify some of the Roman emperors starting with Augustus and ending with the dynasty of Septimius Severus. Known evidence in the form of inscriptions and dedications indicates with certainty that the emperors Augustus, Caracalla, Titus, Tiberius, Trajan, Vespasian, Claudius, Nero, and Septimius Severus and his succeeding dynasty all formed imperial cults that were represented on Cyprus. These cults were mostly formed by the emperors in an attempt to solidify their right to rule and gain religious support as peers of the Roman pantheon of gods. = Religion and imperial cults = As far back in Cyprus' history as archaeological evidence exists, so too do examples of religion. Around the middle of the 4th century B.C., a new ruling dynasty‚Äîthe Ptolemies‚Äîgained power over Cyprus and established imperial cult over the existing religions on the island. This imperial cult put the king at the head of religious observance on the island, and dictated that he was on an equal footing with other gods. To the average citizen, the king was considered a direct representative or descendant of the gods. It is easy to see the extent to which politics and religion became intertwined not only with each other, but with society as well; the king maintained control over the Koinon, an administrative body founded by the various cities scattered across Cyprus for the purpose of coordinating religious activities and festivals. Imperial cult continued to exist throughout Roman occupation of Cyprus, and a number of unique cults emerged from this transition to the Roman period. After Augustus gained control of Rome‚Äîand Cyprus with it‚Äîthe island's inhabitants seemed perfectly willing to accept the divinity of the new emperor. Much of our information about Roman religion on the island comes from five sources: ancient literature, Cypriot numismatics, excavations and archaeological work, epigraphy, and burials. Through an analysis of these sources, where appropriate, scholars have been able to come up with an idea of how Roman involvement affected Cypriot religion. One example of epigraphy that illustrates the Roman Imperial cult is found on a white marble slab that originated from the Sanctuary of Aphrodite at Palaiaphos. Essentially, this text contains an oath of obedience that the priests at the temple would be forced to abide by. The oath invokes the names of the Roman gods in a manner that suggests that the ruler‚Äîin this case, the emperor Tiberius Augustus‚Äîis comparable or equal to the pantheon of other gods. Each god and goddess named represents a different region of Cyprus; thus, the tablet is basically confirming the entire island's allegiance to the Roman empire. The tablet leaves little doubt that future generations must continue to support the emperor and his family in all regards. Evidence of imperial cult through inscriptions can be found as far back as the earliest Ptolemaic rulers, and continue on until 391 A.D., when the Roman emperor Theodosius I outlawed all pagan worship in the empire. The pagan Temple of Aphrodite at Palaiaphos retained its religious importance to the island even after the founding of Paphos at the dawn of the Hellenistic period. Ancient literary sources tell us that men and women from all over the island would walk from Paphos to Palaiaphos as part of a religious ceremony honoring Aphrodite. It seems that the importance of this religious festival helped maintain the status of the city throughout the Roman period. The importance of the cult of Aphrodite is unquestionable, along with its wealth. For this reason, the high priest at Paphos was granted far more power than his involvement in mere religious functions; instead, the priesthood became more like a theocracy. Evidence from inscriptions suggests that the high priest may have had a hand in all religious matters across the entirety of the island. The temple at Palaiaphos was the leading center for the emperor cult. At the beginning of the 3rd century A.D., a statue of the Roman emperor Caracalla was consecrated at Paphos. In the year proceeding, a second statue of the emperor was erected, this time at Palaiaphos. Inscriptions at the old city suggest that aside from Aphrodite, only the Roman emperor was worshiped there. Even at the new city, worship was reserved to only a few gods and the emperor. These gods were most likely Zeus Polieus, Aphrodite, and Hera, while the emperor was worshiped down to the end of the Severan Dynasty--Septimius Severus‚Äîthe final emperor who enforced imperial cult. Beginning with Augustus in the early first century, Paphos welcomed the emperor as a living god, and inscriptions prove the promised fidelity of the inhabitants of not only Paphos, but all of Cyprus to the new emperor. Despite seeming reluctant to acquire the title, Augustus, the first Roman emperor, was treated as a god on Cyprus. Even the emperor's daughter, Julia, and his wife, Livia, became \\"the Goddess Augusta and the Goddess the New Aphrodite,\\" respectively. It seems that there was no shortage of priests and other religious figures more than willing to acknowledge the emperor's divinity in exchange for recognition from Rome. Titles began to be conferred between Rome and the priesthood to solidify each other's right to authority. As previously mentioned, the main method by which the imperial cult ordained its members was through an oath of allegiance to the emperor. Countless statues and other monuments were erected in nearly all of the cities of Cyprus; for instance, a statue of the emperor Vespasian was erected in Salamis by the gymnasiarchs there, but was consecrated by a religious figure. This monument to the emperor reinforces the idea that there was a strong connection between the activities of the state and the pagan cults. A number of other pagan cults are known to have existed across the island, centered primarily around the major cities of Cyprus. These cities usually had large temples that were dedicated to a specific patron god of the city: in Amathus as in Palaiaphos, Aphrodite had her own cult; in Salamis, Zeus Olympius; Paphos contained cults for the gods Asclepius, Hygieia, and Apollo; in Curium, Apollo Hylates. Though these are but a few examples of the many numerous cults, it is important to note that many gods had temples and dedications in many different locations, but not every god is represented. Because Aphrodite is said to have been born from the sea foam around Cyprus, she appears to be consistently worshiped across the island, as evidenced by recurring temples dedicated in her honor. For each of these cults, the method of worship was different; it is hard to say with certainty what each temple did specifically, but we do know from numismatic evidence and literary records that the cult of Aphrodite likely involved prostitution but not blood sacrifice of animals. It is assumed that a majority of these cults followed similar worship services to those found in the corresponding temples in Rome and other locations around the Empire. Despite this assumption, there does not seem to be much evidence to pinpoint specific details surrounding the cult procedures. While Roman imperial cult maintained significance up until the late 4th century, the ancient pantheon of gods slowly faded out of existence along the way. Following the emperor Caracalla's death in 217 A.D., inscriptions have nothing more to say about cults such as the Paphian Aphrodite, the Zeus of Salamis, or the Apollo of Hyle at Curium. Each of these cults had enjoyed a long and prosperous history on the island, and, like the imperial cult, seemed to disappear rather suddenly around the 3rd and 4th centuries‚Äîthe period of Severan rule. All across the island, both imperial cult and the traditional gods began to lack the necessary power to sustain religious faith; after the Roman period, the citizens of Cyprus began to turn to newer, more private gods that were easily accessible and suited to the needs of the individual. = Jewish Revolt = Under the reign of Ptolemy I, there was a large exodus of Jews from Palestine to other areas of the Mediterranean. Their increasing presence on Cyprus most likely occurred due to the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in 70 AD. A large representation of the Cypriot population, the Jews were also strongly involved in the copper industry. As noted by inscriptions on the construction of a local synagogue, the community of Jews were also possibly on the island to supply wine for the services at the Temple of Jerusalem. With years of building tension with the Romans, during the reign of Trajan in 116 AD, the Jews revolted at Salamis, as well as in Egypt and Cyrene. The most destruction however occurred at Salamis, where there were no stationed Roman garrisons or troops. Led by Artemion, it is estimated that over 240,000 perished in the revolt. Detailed by the writings of Cassius Dio, the Jews brutally massacred every non-Jew in the city. The revolt was quickly quelled by the Roman General Lusius Quietus. All Jews were expelled permanently from the island and even those that were driven there by storm were executed immediately. Although archaeological evidence suggests that in later centuries the Jewish community was re-established. = Introduction and spread of Christianity = In AD 45, St. Paul went on his first missionary journey to Cyprus with St. Barnabas, a native Cypriot Jew, and John Mark. Starting at Antioch, they traveled to the port of Seleucia and onwards to Salamis to preach Christianity. As noted in the Acts of the Apostles 13:1-14:27, on their journey to Paphos, Paul and Barnabas encountered the Roman Proconsul Sergius Paulus and a Jewish sorcerer, Elymas Bar-Jesus. Upon hearing Paul's words, Bar-Jesus was temporarily blinded, and this act convinced Sergius Paulus to convert to Christianity. He was the first Roman governor to do so. After a quarrel with Paul, Barnabas and John Mark traveled back to Cyprus on his second missionary journey. During his preaching at Salamis, Barnabas was murdered by a group of Jews. John Mark buried him with a copy of the gospel of St. Matthew, which Barnabas always carried with him. = Major basilicas and churches = The ancient village of Kopetra in the Vasilikos valley contains the remains of three churches dating to the Late Roman period. The first, a small basilica located at the site of Sirmata, dates to around the beginning of the 7th century. The basilica contains a crypt with two tombs. The construction styles of the tombs suggest the second was added later, around the middle of the 7th century. The central courtyard of the basilica was surrounded on three sides by rooms which may have served as domestic spaces for the religious community living there. A cistern had also been cut into one corner of the courtyard. The basilica was close to and yet separate from the nearby village, reflecting the spirit of monasticism in early Christianity. The second church, which was located to the south of Kopetra, was similar in design and proportions to the Sirmata basilica. The remains of a mosaic floor have been found in the sanctuary, although the original subject remains a mystery. The third and largest of the three churches lies to the northeast of Kopetra. The architectural style is similar to the other two Kopetra churches, yet also reflects many characteristics of churches built across the island during the 5th and 6th centuries. The dome covering the sanctuary once held a colorful glass mosaic. All three churches were likely maintained and used until they were abandoned some time in the 7th century. The basilica of Kourion was built over the remains of the buildings destroyed in the earthquake of A.D. 365. Although its proportions were a little longer than other examples, the basilica was internally similar in architecture to other 5th-century churches and basilicas. The ruined buildings provided all the limestone, granite, and marble needed to build the new church. Remains of a mosaic between the windows in the sanctuary have been found among the ruins. A well-preserved mosaic belonging to one of the previous buildings has been found beneath the floor of the diakonikon. A total of forty inscriptions have been found in and around the basilica, although most remain only in fragments and were only preserved by the reuse of materials after the basilica was abandoned. The earliest inscription dates from the 3rd century BCE, during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphos. The inscriptions dating to the Roman Period on Cyprus include one honoring the proconsul Julianus, and another which mentions the gymnasium of Kourion. The basilica was destroyed by an earthquake in the 7th century. Remains suggest that the building was not immediately abandoned, but was still used until the 8th century. The Late Roman site of Maroni Petrera is located along the south coast of Cyprus in the Maroni Valley near the modern village of Maroni. The remains of a church have been uncovered at this site as part of the Maroni Valley Archaeological Survey Project (MVASP) founded in 1990. The Petrera church was the religious center for the Maroni valley, yet archaeological evidence of a complex of rooms and courtyards separate from the church indicate that the site was also associated with storage and agricultural production. Recovered remains indicate that the decoration of the church was relatively plain; there is almost no evidence of mosaics, wall-paintings, or the use of marble. Otherwise, the Petrera church was architecturally similar to contemporary Christian buildings in Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean. = Roman Cypriot burials = Burial customs are typically slow to change, even during times of social transition and foreign influence. Burial customs on Cyprus during the Hellenistic period were largely retained during the Roman period. Nevertheless, the study of these customs can still provide a great deal of insight into who was living in Cyprus at the time and the extent of their influence. The tombs of Roman Cyprus typically were cave-like chambers with sloping dromos, the ends of which were sealed with earth and occasionally with stone. The number, size, and ornamentation of these chambers in differed according to wealth, ethnicity, and the dates of construction. Multiple burials, in which all members of a family shared a tomb, continued to be popular into the Roman period. The typical burial chamber was an elongated rectangle, with side niches or accompanying chambers. Loculi, or rectangular bed-like areas for the dead, were often attached to the chambers, radiating in a symmetrical fashion. Plaques next to loculi with inscriptions of the names of the dead or proverbs in honor of the dead were not uncommon. Epitaphs containing ethnic adjectives, or titles indicating rank or status, have proved helpful in determining the context of certain burials. Identification of the dead was also located on cippi, located directly above the tomb. Cippi are carved-stone altars comprising a base, a narrow shaft, and a cap. Inscriptions labeling the tombs were made on the shafts of the cippi, and other forms of ornamentation (such as foliage) were common. The living could honor their dead by placing flowers on the cippus or pouring libations on the cippus. Gifts continued to be incorporated into burial, as seen in early period of Cypriot history. Jewelry, imported Roman pottery, local imitation pottery, gold wreaths, and glass were common burial gifts. Mummy portraits, depicting the deceased wearing gold wreaths and busts or stelae of the dead, began to emerge as a result of Alexandrian influence. Lamps, cookware, and libation vessels have been excavated in these tombs, suggesting the continuation of funerary feasts of the living during the Roman period on Cyprus. Tomb structures that are unique or scarcely located are assumed to be those of the elite, or foreign. Uncommon burial practices that occurred during Roman Cyprus included cremation, tumulus tombs, sarcophagi, and peristyle tombs. A multitude of tombs in Nea Paphos, excavated by M. Markides in 1915, represent Peristyle tombs. Peristyle tombs typically had a long, stepped dromos, a long rectangular vaulted room with radiating loculi, and several minor chambers (one located directly behind the other). These are attributed to either Egyptian-born individuals, or Cypriot elite who wished to be buried in the Alexandrian fashion, because Nea Paphos was a significant site of contact with Egypt. Luigi palma di Cesnola and others extensively excavated the site of Kourion. The Roman tombs excavator here were elaborate and highly representative of Roman burial outside of Cyprus. Tomb 8, detailed my George McFadden had a stepped dromos with oblong ashars along the sides. The tomb had a saddled roof, and two large chambers with doorways. The doorways were accented by decorated posts and lintels. The interpretation of the complexity of this tomb is under debate. Another example of a tomb likely belonging to a foreign family is tomb 26 of the Swedish Cyprus excavation in the early 20th century at Amathus. The tomb is an unusual, large, flat tumulus tomb built upon a rock. The tomb has a circular shaft with a stone pithos in middle. Inside the pithos is an alabastron containing carefully washed, cremated bones. Other rare discoveries of Roman-period cremation remains have been found in cylindrical lead urns. Unfortunately, Cypro-Classical and Hellenistic tombs have been difficult for archaeologists to define because of haphazard excavation of tombs on Cyprus, as with other sites. Looting or treasure- seeking individuals often left tombs in unpreferable conditions, void of archaeological context, making modern research difficult, if not impossible. Additional prime examples of burials during the Roman period on Cyprus can be observed at the sites of Agioi Omologites - Nicosia, the necropolis at Marion, the necropolis near Skouriotissa, and tombs of Paphos, Curium, Kition, and Salamis. = Women in Cyprus = For women on Cyprus during the Roman period, life was restricted mainly to domestic activities. Based on the large amount of epigraphical material from Mesaoria and the southern coast of Cyprus, women did have a part in public life. One-third of these epitaphs are to women. Most of these women mentioned are married to men of status and wealth, or come from wealthy families. This was the most common way for a woman to have a public life. For example, a woman from Salamis, the wife of a Salaminian High Priest of the Augusti, was honored by the Koinon for her public spirit. In addition, a Claudia Appharion, the High Priestess of Demeter for the entire island, was distinguished publicly as well. A woman belonging to a Senatorial family, and a benefactress of Paphos were also honored for their public spirit. Women were mainly left to household duties, but those of particular wealth, or married to men of political or high social status could make a name for themselves. Religion was really the only other avenue left to women to create a public identity. Art and culture = Glass in Roman Cyprus = Before the invention of glass blowing in the mid first-century BC, glass had been a fairly rare and expensive luxury commodity, the use of which was mostly confined to containers for perfume and cosmetics. However, with the invention of glass blowing, glass became much more widely available and affordable and began to be produced on a much larger scale with factories dedicated to the production of glass being established throughout the Roman world, including Cyprus. Though it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between locally produced Cypriot glass and imported glass in Cyprus, it can be conclusively stated that glass was in fact being manufactured locally within the island. Evidence for this can be found in sites such as Salamis, Tamassos, Limassol and Amathus. A glass workshop was discovered at Tamassos by Ohnefalsch Richter though he was unfortunately unable to fully publish his findings. He does however mention the discovery of a glass furnace which points to glass being manufactured at the site. Although his discoveries were never dated precisely, many consider it likely that they dated to the 2nd to 3rd centuries AD. Blocks of glass were discovered at Salamis which seems to indicate that this was another glass production center though a furnace associated with this site has not yet been discovered. Cypriot glass is thought to have flourished in the Antonine and Severan periods, or from 140 AD to 240 AD and indeed most of the glass discovered is dated to this time. The fact that the economy in Cyprus was flourishing during this period further supports this conclusion. Olaf Vessberg studied the large quantities of glass found in the tombs of Limassol and Amathus and made several discoveries. First of these was that Cypriot glass is fairly homogeneous. Its function was for the most part limited to daily use, being employed either toward cosmetic purposes or as tableware. The principal shapes being produced by Cypriot glass blowers consisted predominantly of jars, beakers and unguentaria, or flasks that contained oil or perfume. Though it is often difficult to distinguish between beakers and jars, the word beaker is mostly used to describe drinking-vessels while jars are considered to be containers for salves and cosmetics. Distinguishing between the two can often be done through examination of the rim of the vessel which would often be unworked if it was not a drinking vessel. Furthermore, jars often had decorated lids that had a design enamelled on the side facing the interior. Among the unguentaria, there were bell-shaped, candlestick, and tubular. As stated before, many held oil or perfume but some think the tubular unguentaria, named tear-bottles by archeologists, may have contained the tears of relatives or the deceased. Glass was also being used in Cyprus to produce sack-shaped beakers. These are significant as they are only found in Cyprus. This, and the presence of several defective pieces in Cyprus gives further evidence of glass manufacturing in Cyprus. = Cypriot sculptures of the Roman period = Roman influence can be seen in the use and import of marble as a medium for sculptures, and the display of these sculptures within civic centers and private homes. This use of marble was limited to economically and politically powerful cities located near harbors such as Salamis and Paphos, where there was easier access to imported marble and means to afford and display these statues. It is unknown whether the marble was carved prior to shipment to Cyprus, or if the marble was shipped as blocks and carved on the island. Although marble was a key part of Roman period sculptures on Cyprus, limestone was still being used for sculptures. The use of limestone has been seen to reflect the easy access, and more likely cheaper material from which to carve from, but it has also been viewed as a reflection of Cypriot art style. Limestone may have been a deliberate choice made by the artist, or buyer, to have a Roman style sculpture carve in Cypriot limestone. This is assumed to reflect the idea of a Roman Cyprus, by combining the Roman art style with the Cypriot limestone. The sculptures discovered on the island do not cover the full Roman style, for example togate figures and busts have yet to be found. There are however many Roman-style portraits, statues, and a few reliefs found on the Island (Vessberg and Westholm, 1956). Inscribed bases attest to the existence of bronze sculptures during the Roman period. The one surviving statue is of the emperor Septimius Severus. Another key change to sculptures during the Roman period, was how the Cypriots displayed their work. Cypriots had reserved their sculptures generally to sanctuaries, and were not meant for large public displays. This changed with the Roman period, as Cypriots began to move their sculptures into the public eye, and into large urban areas. This allowed the island to show off the grandeur and splendor of Rome, and to honor the Roman emperors. With the transition to Christianity the older sculptures were modified to reflect Christian values, such as covering or destruction of nudity, or modification of old Greek gods into Christian figures. Presently, Salamis is the most important city for Roman period sculptures, but Paphos, Kourion, and Soli are also important archeological sites. Earthquakes Cyprus is located at the boundary between the African and Eurasian plate, an active margin in which the African plate is colliding with the Eurasian plate. This collision between two plates is the cause for the large magnitude and frequent earthquakes, especially seen in the southern portion of the Island where a portion of the African plate is thought to be subducting underneath Cyprus. Historically Cyprus has been affected by 16 destructive earthquakes, 7 or higher on the modified Mercalli scale, from 26 B.C. to 1900 A.D. Six earthquakes of note affected Cyprus during the Roman period. In 26 B.C. an earthquake with an intensity of 7 with an epicenter located southwest of Cyprus caused damage in the city of Paphos. In 15 B.C. many towns in Cyprus experienced a magnitude 8 earthquake, but at Paphos and Kourion it registered as a magnitude 9. Its epicenter was southwest of Paphos and it left the city in ruins. Paphos was subsequently rebuilt and renamed Augusta by the Romans. The earthquake of 76 A.D. was among the most destructive earthquakes, with a magnitude between 9 and 10, and it was reported to have created a tsunami. Its epicenter was located southeast of Cyprus. Salamis and Paphos took the brunt of this earthquake, and fell into ruin, with other cities such as Kition and Kourion have been assumed to share the same fate due to magnitude of the earthquake. The destructive nature of the earthquakes can also be recorded in the transfer of Roman mint to Cyprus, as a means to alleviate the island from this disaster. A magnitude 7 earthquake that left Salamis and Paphos in ruins occurred sometime between 332-333 A.D. Its epicenter was located east of the island. In 342 A.D. a magnitude 10 earthquake struck Paphos and Salamis, destroying the cities. It may also have changed the course of some small rivers, as well as causing a series of landslides and fault displacements. The final Roman-period earthquake, a magnitude 7 to 8, occurred in 365 A.D. The south coast of Cyprus was greatly affected by the quake, especially Akrotiri and Kourion. A series of earthquakes following upon the initial quake laid waste to Kourion, and marked the transition into Christianity. Cities = Nea Paphos (\\"New Paphos\\") = Nea Paphos officially became a city in 312 BC under Nikokles, the last king of the Pafian kingdom. It wasn't until the second century that the city grew in importance and became the capital of Roman Cyprus. The earliest account of Paphos as the capital of the island actually comes from \\"The Acts of the Apostles\\" in the New Testament, where Paul and Barnabas stayed to preach to Sergius Paulus, who then converted to Christianity. Roman Paphos reached its golden age under the Severan Dynasty (and it is attested that there was even an imperial cult to Septimius Severus). Nea Paphos is not to be confused with Palaiaphos (\\"Old Paphos\\"). However, it is difficult to separate the two, because they were considered to be the same city under Roman rule, and were connected by \\"a sacred way\\". Nea Paphos was the city center, whereas Palaiaphos, where the Temple of Aphrodite was, acted as a religious center. The temple of Aphrodite at Palaiaphos was one of the most important temples in all of Cyprus. It seems that the importance of this religious festival helped maintain the status of the city throughout the Roman period. It is even said that the emperor Titus visited the Temple of Aphrodite at Paphos on his way to Syria. Once there, Titus was awed by the lavishness of the sanctuary and inquired as to his future endeavors as emperor. The high priest and the goddess Aphrodite herself, supposedly, confirmed the ruler's favorable future and successful journey to Syria. The temple at Palaiaphos was the leading center for the emperor cult. At the beginning of the 3rd century A.D., a statue of the Roman emperor Caracalla was consecrated at Nea Paphos. In the year proceeding, a second statue of the emperor was erected, this time at Palaiaphos. Inscriptions at the old city suggest that aside from Aphrodite, only the Roman emperor was worshiped there. Even at the new city, worship was reserved to only a few gods and the emperor. These gods were most likely Zeus Polieus, Aphrodite, Apollo, and Hera. The Sanctuary to Apollo was to the southeast, right outside of the ancient city. It was composed of two underground chambers ‚Äì a front rectangular one and a back circular one with a dome. This Sanctuary might be contemporary with the foundation of the city. The emperor, on the other hand, was worshiped down to the end of the Severan Dynasty--Septimius Severus‚Äîthe final emperor who enforced imperial cults. Imperial cults were not the only way in which Paphos showed its devotion to the empire. In fact, Paphos created a calendar, called either the Imperial or Cypriot calendar, sometime between 21 and 12 BC. This was done to praise Augustus and the Imperial family. It is likely that the calendar was created in 15 BC when the emperor provided funds to rebuild the city after a large earthquake. Although it originated in Paphos, it quickly grew popular and dominated the western and northern areas of Cyprus, and perhaps the southern coast as well. However, it was not the only calendar used throughout the island. The other was the Egyptian calendar used in Salamis, a city who remained loyal to her Egyptian past rather than the empire. Paphos was also given several titles under various emperors. After it was damaged by an earthquake in 15 BC, it received financial aid from the Augustus and the title \\"Augusta.\\" The additional name of Flavia, which Paphos bore in Caracalla's reign (Paphos Augusta Claudia Flavia), was evidently added as a result of the rebuilding of the city under the Flavians after it suffered from another earthquake. It was at this time that the mint was transferred from Syrian Antioch to Paphos. These silver coins, however, were short lived. The city was given the title of \\"Claudia\\" in A.D. 66. Paphos was also the favorite city of Cicero, a prominent Roman orator and politician. The Koinon was a confederation of the various Cypriot cities that maintained political and religious power over Cyprus. Acting as a representative body for all of Cyprus' cities, the Koinon was likely founded at Palaiaphos because the Temple of Aphrodite located there hosted a number of religious festivities which attracted Cypriots from all corners of the island. By the end of the Roman period, the Koinon had gained the power to mint its own coins, bestow honorary titles on important individuals (including erecting statues), determine games and other religious events, and even control politics to a degree. It is unclear when the Koinon began to meet at Paphos, though it certainly occurred by the end of the 4th century B.C. Despite this shift in locations, the old city maintained importance as the center for religious activity on Cyprus for centuries after, up until the end of the 4th century A.D., when the Roman emperor Theodosius I outlawed all pagan religions. Paphos - Agora Nea Paphos was located on the western coast of Cyprus, where modern day Kato Paphos now stands. It was among the wealthiest, if not the wealthiest city in Roman Cyprus. The city had walled with towers disposed at regular intervals, and had a harbor (and although it was not of significant size, it was protected by two breakwaters and is still serviceable today). There was also an odeon and a theatre, and two large houses have been excavated. An agora has been found, but only the foundation exists today and excavations are still ongoing. What might have been an acropolis is now covered by a modern-day lighthouse. PanoOdeonPaphos The odeon, although damaged by the hands of quarrymen, has been partially restored. It was a semi-circle and consisted of an auditorium and a stage. It was built entirely out of stone and faced the agora; it was destroyed under the earthquakes of the fourth century. The theatre was built as a result of the urbanization of Paphos. It was located on the northeast corner of the town, built against the southern face of a low hill, and positioned so that the audience could look across the town and in the direction of the harbor. It held approximately 8000‚Äì8500 people and was one of the few times the entire community came together. The orchestra was in the flat area between the curve of the seating and the stage building. There is very little left of the stage and the stage building today. The use of the theatre ended in the later part of the fourth century, possibly around the earthquake in 365AD. It was excavated by the University of Sydney in 1995 and a series of exploratory trenches were opened by the University of Trier in 1987. The two houses that have been excavated, the House of Theseus and the House of Dionysus, are both large and luxurious houses, another sign that indicates that Paphos was a very wealthy city. The former of the two, the House of Theseus, was a public building that probably belonged to the Roman governor of Cyprus. It was named after a mosaic of Theseus killing a Minotaur that was found in the house and dates to the fourth century. The house is located a short distance from the northwest harbor. The main entrance is to the east and the principal room is in the south wing, along with the baths. Most of the mosaics have been badly damaged and excavations of the house are ongoing. Houses of Dionysos Mosaic, Paphos2 The House of Dionysus, on the other hand, was a private house, probably belonging to a very wealthy citizen. It was given the name because of the frequent appearance of the god on the mosaic floors and dates to the latter half of the second century. On top of the mosaics in the principle rooms, the walls were also decorated with beautiful designs. The bedroom and bathrooms lie in the east wing of the house, whereas the kitchen and workshops lie to the west. Facing the bedrooms to the south is a fish pond \\"equipped with niches around its bottom in order to serve as a refuge for the fish in hot weather.\\" Excavations of the house began in 1962. Hellenistic cemeteries for Palaiaphos are found at the south and southwest areas of the city; cemeteries of geometric, archaic, and classical periods found North, East, Southeast of Palaiaphos. The \\"Tombs of the Kings\\" can be found at the northernmost end of the northern necropolis of Paphos. The tombs themselves are not \\"royal\\" but \\"owe their name to their impressive character.\\" They date back to the third century BC, but some of the tombs were used in the Early Christian period. The city suffered severely from earthquakes in the fourth century AD. It was around this time, in 346, that the capital was transferred back to Salamis. Cyprus continued to grow and enjoy several prosperities in the 400s and 500s, but Paphos was already in ruins by this point. = Palaiaphos (\\"Old Paphos\\") = In Roman Cyprus, Palaiaphos was known primarily for the Sanctuary of Aphrodite Paphia. Palaiaphos is located on a limestone hill in southwestern Cyprus, at the mouth of the Diarrhizos river, about one mile inland from the coast. Myth claims that the goddess Aphrodite was born from the sea foam and rose on the rock at the coast called Petra tou Rhomiou. The sanctuary is located a few miles east of the modern Cypriote town of Kouklia, and surrounded, to the west and southwest, by Hellenistic and Roman cemeteries. This sanctuary has one of the longest traditions of cult worship on the island, lasting about 1600 years. Even after the foundation of Nea Paphos in the late 4th century BC, Palaiaphos did not lose its significance. It remained a central place of worship in the Mediterranean world and cult worship of Aphrodite continued at this site until the Christian Roman emperor Theodosius I outlawed all pagan worship in 391 AD. Modern construction in the town of Kouklia has unfortunately obliterated much of the remains at Palaiaphos. However, enough remains that Roman built temples can be identified apart from earlier constructions. These buildings are situated on an East/West orientation, and are located in the Northern part of the sanctuary complex. The two buildings, built sometime between the late first and early second century AD, keep to the traditional open court plan for the Paphian cult. It is thought that these were built after the earthquake in 76/77 AD that may have caused some destruction to the sanctuary complex. Reconstructions of the Roman sanctuary show the buildings to surround a rectangular open court, possibly left open on the West side, and enclosed by a South Stoa, an East wing, and a North Hall. The north and south halls are thought to have housed cultic banquets for the goddess. A shrine with an aniconic (non-human form) representation of the goddess Aphrodite was most likely moved from the Old Temple to the new Roman temple. During festivals and celebrations, this conical shaped stone that was a symbol of the fertility goddess was anointed with oils incense were offered. Other religious activities included a procession from the new city to the sanctuary and some form of religious prostitution. The sanctuary to Aphrodite was one of the primary religious centers on Cyprus. The site was famous and attracted visitors from all over the Mediterranean world. There were many Imperial patrons of the sanctuary and a few emperors even visited the temple, including Trajan and Titus. The importance of the sanctuary is what kept Palaiaphos on the map after Nea Paphos was founded. There was a paved road from Nea Paphos to Palaiaphos that Cypriots would travel in procession for festivals. = Salamis = Salamis, located by the modern city of Famagusta, was one of the most important cities on Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean during the reign of the Ptolemies. It represents a shift of center to the north, which coincided with the opening of the 'south harbor' at the southern end of the protecting reef‚Äîa harbor which was to remain in commission until the flooding of the entire coast-line, possibly in the 4th century. But Salamis, despite this new harbor, was supplanted by Paphos in the early 2nd century BC as the capital of this island; and this distinction, once lost, was not recovered until AD 346, when the city was re-founded as Constantia.Mitford, T.B. (1980). \\"Roman Cyprus\\". Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt (Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter) 7 (2): 1321‚Äì1323. An inscription of the middle Hellenistic date appears to attest to the existence of four gymnasia, which puts Salamis on par with Ephesus and Pergamum. The largest gymnasium, or panegyrikon, which has been excavated, was enlarged during the early Roman Empire by the addition of a bathing establishment and palaestra. Salamis also contained an amphitheatre, also excavated and partially restored, which had a capacity of no less than 15,000 spectators. The amphitheatre, as well as a Roman Bath House, are attributed to the Flavian Ser. Sulpicius Pancles Veranianus. Also discovered at Salamis was a massive temple to Zeus with a ramp constructed in the late Republican or Augustan times and a vast colonnaded agora, which was in use throughout the Roman Imperial period. Salamis, if not the political, remained the industrial capital of the Cyprus, and indeed the most important city on the island. In AD 22, the temple of Zeus Olympius was one of only three temples in all Cyprus to receive confirmation of its right of asylum. However, there are only eight references, Hellenistic and Roman, to Zeus Olympius, and, as compared with the popularity of the Pafian, the god of Salamis was not esteemed by the emperors and their families. Salamis, unlike Paphos, appears to have been ill at ease with Rome and used, down to the days of Epiphanius, the Egyptian rather than the Roman Imperial calendar. But inscriptions which honor Emperors are by no means uncommon. There are honors accorded to Augustus, to Livia and to his adopted sons; to Tiberius, Nero, Vespasian, Hadrian, Plotina, Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. There is particular enthusiasm for Hadrian, who came to the aid of Salamis, devastated in AD 116 by the Jewish insurrection of Artemion. Salamis shared in the Severan floruit, which is attested by numerous Severan inscriptions, one of which records the erection of a tethrippon to carry the statues of Septimius Severus, his wife and sons. Also during this time, the orchestra of the theatre was converted into a pool for aquatic games. To the west of the city vast cemeteries extended, but, as compared to Archaic and Classical burial, the Roman tombs are conspicuous for their poverty. The Imperial cult was prominent in Salamis, together with the very erratic incidence of Roman civitas. The city received her water under Nero from the famous spring at Chytri, some 24 miles distant, by rock-cut channel and aqueduct. Salamis was destroyed by repeated earthquakes in the middle of the 4th century AD, but was quickly rebuilt as a Christian city by the Emperor of Constantinople, Constantius II‚Äîhence its new name, Constantia. This was a much smaller city than it was previously, centered around the harbor and fortified by walls. Some of the pagan public buildings that lay outside the boundaries of the Christian city, such as the gymnasium and even the theatre, were partly rebuilt, the former as baths and the latter to stage mimic productions.Karageorghis, Vassos (1999). Excavating at Salamis in Cyprus. (Athens: The A.G. Leventis Foundation. = Kourion = Kourion, located on the Southern coast of Cyprus and protected by cliffs on the north and east, was a walled acropolis with a necropolis to the southeast, and a well-preserved stadium and the sanctuary of Apollo Hylates in the west. However, it is said to have made \\"no palpable impact upon the Roman world of its day\\". We know most about this city through the many inscriptions found on the site and through the excavations of two large residences, the House of Achilles Mosaic and the House of the Gladiators. Inscriptions found in Kourion have been an invaluable source to the study of Kourion. They are important as they tell us about the various building projects conducted in Kourion under the Romans and the involvement of various emperors. They even provide a record of several of the proconsuls in Kourion and their achievements. They give us insight into the Neronian restoration, repairs done to the Hellenistic theatre under Augustus, the remodeling of the theater into a hunting-theatre under Caracalla, and other important events in the city. Kourion has a fair number of inscriptions on statues of important figures during the Roman period, including Nero, Trajan, and various proconsuls. There are also a few plaques in honor of Caracalla, Septimius Severus, and other important figures. Inscriptions in and around the Sanctuary of Apollo detail the stages of construction and improvements made to the Sanctuary. Several defixiones, or curse tablets, have also been found at Kourion, often targeting other citizens over legal disputes and of a sufficient quantity to distinguish Kourion from other sites. Several funerary inscriptions left by relatives of the dead were also found although these were not particularly common in Kourion. The Sanctuary of Apollo, located approximately west of Kourion was a significant feature of the city, being described as the most impressive cult-centre in Cyprus. It is thought to have been built around 65 or 66 AD, during the reign of Nero and would have undoubtedly been destroyed by the massive earthquake of 365 AD. It was first discovered and excavated by Louis Cesnola, whose account of the site proved invaluable as it was later plundered and devastated by stone-seekers. Though Cesnola mentions the presence of columns in his account, none were found by later excavators. The temple would later be rediscovered by George McFadden, whose greatest impact regarding the study of the sanctuary of Apollo was his discovery that the temple had two phases, one Hellenistic and the other Roman. However, the most significant contributor to the study of this temple would have to be Robert Scranton who made many notable findings. It was he who suggested that the temple was never completely rebuilt but instead had its front remodeled, interior divided, and floor level raised under the Romans. Though there is still some debate regarding the exact dating of the temple, many believe it to have been constructed during the reign of Nero. This is supported by the fact that the Neronian period was a time of relative prosperity in Kourion as attested to by the fact that the Theater of Kourion was rebuilt around 64 or 65 AD, only a year or two before the construction of the temple. Overall, it seems that the temple was modernized under the Romans but no dramatic changes appear to have been made. Flowing water (provided to the temple and the city during the reign of Claudius) and a tighter organization of the space constitute two examples of Roman modernization of the temple. The temple also seems to have had strong Near Eastern connections, evidenced by coins, architecture, and pottery. Because of Kourion's association of Trajan as Apollo Caesar with Apollo Hylates, he contributed to the building of several structures including the Curium Gate, SE Building, the Bath House, S Building, and the NW Building, as indicated by inscriptions bearing his name. However, after his death worship of Apollo Caesar ended. The House of the Achilles Mosaic, with its open courtyard surrounded by rooms on both sides and colonnaded portico to the northeast, was dated to approximately the first half of the fourth century AD and is most notable for the large mosaic depicting the famous Greek myth in which Odysseus, by sounding a false alarm, was able to fool Achilles, then disguised as a woman, to reveal his true identity, thus bringing about his participation in the Trojan War which is famously described in Homer's Iliad. The building had mosaic floors, one of which, although damaged, seems to portray the Trojan prince Ganymede being abducted by Zeus. More is known about the other famous residence, the House of the Gladiators, which was located in close proximity to the city wall and several meters east of the House of Achilles, seems to have been the residence of a fairly affluent patrician. This house is dated to the second half of the third century AD, apparently having been built prior to the House of Achilles. It consisted of a central courtyard with corridors lining all four walls. The rooms open directly into these corridors. The floor was once covered with mosaics, with cisterns underground to collect rainwater. The house unfortunately did not escape the devastating earthquake of 365 AD unscathed. The walls, roof, and mosaics were all severely damaged. Located in the central courtyard is a mosaic, remarkably preserved, depicting a gladiatorial combat scene, This is significant as such scenes were extremely rare in Cyprus. Only two of the three panels depicting this scene survive unfortunately. The theater, which was built in the northern part of the acropolis and excavated by the Pennsylvania University Museum from 1949 to 1950, was renovated under Roman rule sometime around 100 AD and once more around 200 AD. Though the auditorium was originally a fully formed circle, under the Romans it was reduced to a half-circle. Around the second century AD it was enlarged to its current size and several buttresses were added to support it. Around 200 AD, it was remodeled to accommodate hunting and gladiatorial games, only to later be converted back into a traditional theater around 300 AD. It is thought to have accommodated somewhere around 3500 spectators. The theater appears to have been abandoned sometime during the fourth century. It still stands today but suffered much from stone-seekers. The stadium, also excavated by the Pennsylvania University Museum, was located in the northwestern region of Kourion with its U-shaped foundation and three entrance gates still standing today and remarkably preserved. It is thought to have been built around the 2nd century AD under the Antonine emperors and remained in use until around 400 AD. It likely accommodated around 6,000 spectators and consisted of a long oval race track for runners and chariot races. An account can be found of its last race and destruction, provided by a Cypriote writing a fictional account of the Life of St. Barnabas in the fifth century. The necropolis was excavated by Cesnola in 1876, and then more reliably under George McFadden who dug 95 pits and uncovered 9 tombs, only one of which he published. This tomb, named Tomb 8, was likely constructed in the third century BC and used up until the first century AD. The other unpublished tombs also seemed to have had similarly extended periods of use. The knowledge regarding Kourion's tombs is not at this point extensive. We only know that they were \\"extremely large and elaborate\\". However, they are certainly worth further study. Tombs are significant sources of information as they are crucial in determining burial practice and are often rich in pottery and other grave goods which can be fairly well preserved. The fall of Roman Kourion can be attributed to the massive earthquake that occurred on April 21, 365 AD. Based on the descriptions of the quake, it appears to have caused a tsunami and has been tentatively given the measurement of 11, other sources state a magnitude 10, on the Modified Mercalli scale of 0 to 12, with 12 indicating total destruction. This earthquake marks the end of antiquity and the start of the Middle Ages as well as the transition to Christianity. = Kition (Citium) = The ancient city of Kition is completely overlaid by the modern city of Larnaka, and is therefore largely unexcavated. It possessed an acropolis at Bamboula; to the southeast of the acropolis lay a large natural harbor, which has since silted in. It was very important in trade as a port city and the administration changed hands many times in its history, notably by the Phoenicians prior to the Roman administration. Even under the rule of the Romans, aspects of the old city life remained. For example, the cult of Eshmun continued into the Augustan age through a transition to the worship of Asclepius. Kition not specific about using its own name, and was often referred to as simple \\"the city\\". (\\"e polis\\" or \\"o demos\\"), which was reflective of its old Phoenician name. There is an abundance of inscriptions in Kition, especially funerary inscriptions, many of which show influences of other cultures, such as Semitic names that have been Hellenized. However, Imperial influence is still apparent in the finding of two statues to the emperor Nerva. Three small areas of the site have been excavated at the present; it was first excavated by the Swedish Cyprus expedition in 1929; second, by Vassos Karageorghis in 1976; and most recently by Marguerite Yon in 1985. = Arsinoe = Arsinoe (immediately north of the modern city of Polis) was founded in 270 B.C. and continued with varying levels of prosperity into the Roman times and so it is well recorded by the geographers of the Roman period as being an important regional city. Arsinoe's importance depended on its proximity to the south Anatolian coast and the Aegean for trade as well as being a major center of exportation for the Imperial copper mines at Limni through the natural harbor at the site. However, Arsinoe's civic importance in the Roman world is attested to the mile-markers found in the region, which were measured in distance from the city. A Roman theatre and a gymnasium from the Ptolemaic period are the only major ruins left at the site. However Strabo, the Greek geographer, tells about a sanctuary to Zeus and Aphrodite a short distance outside the Roman city. Although there are a few archaeological remains, there is a surprising lack of epigraphical evidence for a city that played such an important role in Roman Cyprus. In the past there have been no major excavations done at the site except for a survey in 1960 conducted by the Department of Antiquities. Recent excavations undertaken by Princeton University are still ongoing but a preliminary exhibition of the artifacts found at Arsinoe is available at the Princeton Art Museum. (http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/exhibitions/upcoming) = Minor cities = Amathus The ancient city of Amathus, near modern-day Limassol (village of Ag. Tychonas) was a city of importance before Roman rule. After Nea Paphos was established as the center of Roman administration on Cyprus, Amathus began to decline. Only the granting of asylum for the sanctuary of Aphrodite by the senate in 22 AD preserved its existence. The city remained unexcavated until 1975, when Pierre Aupert and the French School at Athens discovered remains on the acropolis, including the temple to Ahprodite, a Christian basilica, palace storerooms, and explored the port. The temple of Aphrodite was renovated in the first or second century AD to combine both Greek and Near Eastern architectural styles. The new structure included a pronaos, a cella, and an adyton. Systematic destruction of the building by later inhabitants makes any further detail for the interior of the structure unidentifiable. The excavator also cannot determine if there was a cult statue housed in the temple. One distinct feature is the style of capitals used on the columns. They are Nabataean style, which is thought to have originated in Egypt. Unlike the sanctuary to Aphrodite in Palaiaphos, pilgrims did not visit the temple in Amathus. In addition to the temple on the acropolis, remains of a typical Roman style bath house were found. A vast necropolis surrounds the city, the south being largely Hellenistic and Roman burials, and the east being strictly Imperial burials. Hundreds of cippi were found widespread throughout the city that suggest \\"a vigorous village life, seemingly less dependent on the polis then elsewhere in Cyprus.\\". Other structures that have been attested to, but not yet discovered, in Amathus are the temple to Hera and the temple to the mysterious Seven within the Stelae. Carpasia Carpasia, near modern Rizokarpasso, remains mostly unexcavated. The site itself consists of about 3 square kilometers on the Karpaz Peninsula next to a natural harbor. The remains of walls which surrounded the entirety of the city can still be seen. An aqueduct, built in Roman times, brought water to the city from natural springs. The remains of columns suggest the presence of a temple near the city's harbor. The chief deity of the Karpaz Peninsula was Aphrodite Acraea, whose temple was located at the tip of Cape Andreas, and farmlands near modern Rizokarpasso were dedicated to the goddess. Carpasia is mentioned by historians in the Classical era, and in inscriptions dating to the Julio- Claudian and Hadrianic eras. Ceryneia Ceryneia, now overlaid by modern-day Kyrenia, was a port city on the northern coast of Cyprus. There is much evidence for the ancient city but epigraphic and archaeological evidence from the Roman era is inconclusive. Although it remains unexcavated, the ancient harbor still stands and occasional finds are made and reported. Three inscription were found that dated the city to the Roman time period; an oath of allegiance to Tiberius the \\"Apollo of Ceryneia,\\" a dedication to the \\"demos of Ceryneia\\" on a statue, and one mentioning the construction of a water- system during Claudius' reign. Chytri Chytri (east of modern Kythrea) was one of only two inland cities on Roman Cyprus (the other was Tamassus). Chytri's most important topographical feature ‚Äî and the reason for its continued existence ‚Äî is its bounteous spring. The site has not been excavated, though an acropolis and extensive cemetery have been identified. Geographers and a single inscription attest to Chytri's independence during the Roman period. Inscriptions indicate a close relationship with Salamis, Chytri's most convenient access to the Mediterranean. Salamis, on the other hand, valued access to Chytri's springwater and under Nero a rock-cut channel and aqueduct was built to bring water to the coastal site. By the time of Caracalla, Chytri may have been subordinate to Salamis. Source: Mitford 1980, 1329‚Äì1330. Lapethus Lapethus was a harbor town located along the northern coast of Cyprus near modern-day Karavas. It was most famous for its copper and earthenware processing, though it was an important commercial site regardless. Copious springs nearby provided the city with a constant supply of freshwater. Remains of the harbor's breakwater and city walls are still visible today, though no other ancient structures can be identified. The city had long been Phoenician in culture, and maintained Semitic speech for a long period of time before Hellenization kicked in. Although the site still remains unexcavated (due to its location in the north), the few inscriptions that originated from this area indicate that the city was extremely important from an economical standpoint; so much so, in fact, that Ptolemy says that it is one of the four conventi that divided the island. Neither temples nor theatres can be found at the site, but it is obvious that the city was accepting of Roman influence because of inscriptions suggesting a gymnasium where the Actaean games were performed in honor of Augustus' victory. Other inscriptions suggest statues of Augustus, Tiberius, Trajan, and Hadrian within the city walls. It is also important to note that the consular of the island during the mid third century, Cl. Leontichus Illyrius, is the first example of Imperial distinction bestowed upon a family native to the island of Cyprus. Soli Soli was the most important city of North-Western Cyprus and the ruins cover a wide area with a low hill that supported the acropolis that is coved by a modern village. This city had great importance to agriculture on the Morphau plain the copper mines in Skouriotissa. The acropolis boasted a large cavea that can hold up to 3500 spectators. The most impressive feature of the site was the broad paved and colonnaded street that ran from east to west across the city. There was also an excavated temple to an unidentified deity as well as an attested gymnasium and temple of Zeus that was once at the site. Statues of important Roman figures such as Emperor Trajan and Marcus Aurelius were erected at the site as well as dedications to Nero, Augustus, and Trajan. The city had great economic importance in Roman Cyprus due to the attested presence of a curator civitatis and a public records office. Tamassos Tamassos (covered in part by modern Politiko) is an extensive and unexcavated site named in the 2nd century B.C. The major topographical features is an outline of the walls to the city, a probable acropolis, and necropolis. The evidence for civic status of the city is determined from geographers. Under Roman rule cities and villages located in the hinterland with no viable economic assets tended to decay, however the copper mine of Tamassos allowed the city to maintain itself, albeit only modestly as seen in only one valuable funerary inscription was found. The mine was Tamassos was the most important aspect of the city, with the copper transported to the port of Soli for trade.

Biography =Early years= Payne was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in 1941. In 1954, Payne moved with his mother to Hartford, Connecticut, where she remarried. According to DNA analysis, he was descended in part from people from Cameroon. The first member of his family to attend college, Payne graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1964 with a degree in English. He was interested in pursuing a career in journalism, but as an African American he found no opportunities in the mainstream press. Instead, Payne joined the army, where he eventually became a captain. He ended his army career with two years as an information officer, writing speeches for General William Westmoreland and running the army newspaper. =Career= Newsday hired Payne in 1969 as an investigative reporter. In 1973, he helped write \\"The Heroin Trail\\", a series of 33 articles that detailed how heroin originated in Turkish poppy fields and found its way to the streets of New York City. Newsday won the 1974 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for \\"The Heroin Trail\\". Next year, it was published as a book credited to the newspaper staff, The Heroin Trail (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1975).\\"The Heroin trail\\". Library of Congress Catalog Record (LCC). Retrieved October 26, 2013. In 1975, Payne and other African Americans working in the media established the National Association of Black Journalists. Payne served as the group's fourth president. Payne co-wrote a series of articles about the Symbionese Liberation Army and the kidnapping of Patty Hearst. These became the basis of his next book, The Life and Death of the SLA (Ballantine Books, 1976), credited to \\"Les Payne and Tim Findley, with Carolyn Craven\\".\\"The life and death of the SLA\\". LCC record. Retrieved October 26, 2013. Payne's reporting from South Africa during the 1976 Soweto Uprising was selected by the jury for a Pulitzer Prize in International Journalism, but the group's advisory board overruled their decision with no explanation. Despite being barred from the country, Payne returned to South Africa in 1985 to chronicle the changes that had taken place during the intervening years. Payne started writing a weekly column for Newsday in 1980. It was syndicated in 1985. In 2006, Newsdays editor said the column was \\"so strong, so provocative and generated so much hate mail that Newsday editors got to know the names of all the Suffolk County Police Department's bomb-sniffing dogs\\". Payne served as Newsdays national editor and assistant managing editor for foreign and national news; at different times, he was responsible for the newspaper's coverage of health and science, New York City, and investigations. He was responsible for New York Newsday, the newspaper's short-lived attempt to compete in the New York City market. His staff won many journalism awards, including six Pulitzer Prizes. After retiring from Newsday in February 2006, Payne continued to contribute his column to the paper until December 2008. In his retirement, he wrote a biography of Malcolm X, which was published in 2020 as The Dead Are Arising: The Life of Malcolm X. The book is framed by essays from Tamara Payne, Payne‚Äôs daughter and primary researcher, who completed the biography after her father‚Äôs death.

Playing career =Club= Guerini's playing career started at Brescia, playing as a regular in the Serie B division. In 1973, he was signed by Serie A club Fiorentina, where he emerged as a young but promising attacking midfielder and won the 1975 Coppa Italia thanks to a goal of his in the final against Milan. His career was however cut short in 1976 after suffering a severe car accident that almost left him impaired. =International= Despite his short playing career, Guerini also had the chance to play as a full international in 1974, when he was lined up by the coaching duo Fulvio Bernardini-Enzo Bearzot for a game against Bulgaria. Managerial career =Early years= Despite being only aged 22, Guerini immediately entered into a non-playing career and became youth coach at his last club Fiorentina, also winning a Campionato Nazionale Primavera title in 1983. On that same year, Serie B club Empoli offered him their head coaching position, the first in Guerini's career. In 1985, he was then hired by another Tuscan club, Pisa, thus having the chance to make his coaching debut in the Serie A league; despite winning a Mitropa Cup on that same year, Guerini however failed to save the team from relegation. His following experience, at Serie B's Bologna, then ended with a dismissal before the end of the season. He then served as head coach of Catanzaro, narrowly missing a top flight promotion, and successively Brescia. =Ancona and later career= In 1989 Guerini was appointed head coach of another Serie B club, Ancona. In what proved to be his most successful stint as a manager, Guerini led Ancona to a historical first promotion ever in the Serie A league (a stint that lasted only one season), then ending as 1993‚Äì94 Coppa Italia runners-up in his final season at the club. He was then hired by Napoli, but dismissed after only eight games (including a UEFA Cup elimination at the hands of Boavista). After that, Guerini had two short-lived coaching experiences in the minor leagues that turned out not to be particularly successful (SPAL, Reggina) until 1997, when he was hired by Piacenza and saved the then-Serie A club from relegation in what is his most successful placement in the top flight to date. Guerini then had a handful of unsuccessful experiences, all them as a replacement coach or with him not completing the season (Ternana, Catania, Siena, Greek side Panachaiki, Catania again, and a second stint at Catanzaro). In 2011, he was hired by former club Fiorentina as \\"club manager\\". On 2 May 2012, he was then appointed caretaker coach after the club decided to remove Delio Rossi from his managerial duties following a physical confrontation with the Serbian player Adem Ljajiƒá during the home league game against the Novara. In his first game in charge, he led Fiorentina to a 1‚Äì0 win at Lecce that mathematically guaranteed the club a place in the 2012‚Äì13 Serie A.

The term Trika was used by Abhinavagupta to represent the whole of Kashmir Shaivism, or to designate the Pratyabhijna system.Carl Olson, The Many Colors of Hinduism, Rutgers University Press, 2007, page 237 The name of the system is derived from its most famous work, ƒ™≈õvara-pratyabhij√±ƒÅ-kƒÅrikƒÅ by Utpaladeva. Etymologically, Pratyabhijna is formed from prati- (\\"re-\\") + abhi (preposition meaning \\"closely\\") + *j√±ƒÅ (\\"to know\\"), so the meaning is \\"direct knowledge of one's self,\\" \\"recognition.\\" The central thesis of this philosophy is that everything is ≈öiva, absolute consciousness, and it is possible to \\"re-cognize\\" this fundamental reality and be freed from limitations, identified with ≈öiva and immersed in bliss.The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 45 Thus, the slave (pa≈õu: the human condition) shakes off the fetters (pƒÅ≈õa) and becomes the master (pati: the divine condition). Masters and texts The Pratyabhijna system had a period of intense development between the ninth and the eleventh centuries, with a lineage of masters and disciples who wrote treatises and mystical poetry. The founder of the Pratyabhijna school was Somananda (875‚Äì925 CE);The Krama Tantricism of Kashmir ‚Äì N. Rastogi, p. 3 his work ≈öivad·πõ·π£·π≠i is the basis of the system. He was followed by his son and disciple, Utpaladeva (900‚Äì950 CE),The Trika Saivism of Kashmir ‚Äì M.L. Pandit, p. 27 who wrote the most important treatise of the system, ƒ™≈õvara pratyabhij√±ƒÅ kƒÅrikƒÅ, a philosophical treatise discussing the fundamental doctrine of the school and comparing it with various rival schools, analyzing the differences and refuting them in the style of Buddhist logic. The name of the school is derived from the title of this work; in the rest of India, the whole Kashmiri Shaivite philosophy was sometimes referred to by the name Pratyabhij√±ƒÅ ≈öƒÅstra. Another important master of this school is Abhinavagupta, who carried out a synthesis between various schools of Kashmir Shaivism in his magnum opus, TantrƒÅloka; Abhinavagupta also wrote two commentaries on ƒ™≈õvara-pratyabhij√±ƒÅ- kƒÅrikƒÅ.Siva Sutras ‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. The disciple of Abhinavagupta, Kshemaraja, wrote a digest of the Pratyabhijna philosophy called Pratyabhij√±ƒÅ- h·πõdaya , The Essence of Re-cognition, which is the most popular introduction to the system. Context =In relation to Advaita Vedanta= With regard to the problem of how the world comes by , Utpaladeva rejects the Advaita VedƒÅnta theory of eternal and independent ignorance (avidyƒÅ),Abhinavagupta and His Works ‚Äì V. Raghavan, p. 28 which affirms that brahman (the absolute consciousness) is being affected by avidyƒÅ (eternal ignorance) by superposition, with a resulting enslavement of the inactive, subject consciousness to worldly life. In Kashmir Shaivism, avidyƒÅ (ignorance) and its cosmic aspect, mƒÅyƒÅ (illusion), are nothing but ≈öakti, the power of ≈öiva; as ≈öakti, they are real for limited beings, but are simple manifestations of consciousness for ≈öiva. In Advaita VedƒÅnta, with regard to the limited being (jiva), all activity belongs to the intellect (buddhi); in Kashmir Shaivism, activity is also ascribed to ƒÅtman, who is not inert, but in possession of the five-fold actions of creation, maintenance, dissolution, occultation, and grace. A liberated jiva, in Advaita VedƒÅnta, is freed from the universe‚Äîbut here, the universe appears as the real I-consciousness, a mass of consciousness and bliss. In Advaita Vedanta, consciousness (cit) is only light (prakƒÅ≈õa), but in Pratyabhijna it is also activity, doer-ship. =Compared with other Kashmir Shaivism schools= In the context of Kashmiri Shaivism, Pratyabhijna is sometimes classified as ≈öambavopayaIntroduction to Kasmir Shaivism, p. 53 (the path of Shambhu, or ≈öiva), and at other times as Anupaya (the Non-path).Introduction to Kasmir Shaivism, p. 89 ≈öambavopaya and Anupaya are classes of practices related to consciousness directly; by contrast, the lower two classes of practice are ≈öaktopaya‚Äîthe path of ≈öakti, which relates to the mind‚Äîand Anavopaya‚Äîthe path of the limited being, which relates to the physical body. Thus, Pratyabhijna is considered to be the shortest, most direct path to liberation, an evolution based on consciousness alone. Even though it shares the same practices relating to the ascension of kundalini in the middle channel (sushumna nadi), Pratyabhijna claims instantaneous progression, while the Krama maintains there is gradual progression. With regard to the Spanda school, Pratyabhijna is more philosophical, putting the accent on instantaneous realization (recognition) of the Ultimate, while the Spanda school is more practical (as per its fundamental text, SpandakƒÅrikƒÅ), and puts its accent on the vibrating energy aspect of consciousness.The Trika Saivism of Kashmir ‚Äì M.L. Pandit, p. 25 =In relation to Buddhism= The most important difference between Pratyabhijna and Buddhism is related to the ontological ultimate: while Buddhism rejects the concepts of soul (atman) and god (ƒ´≈õvara), the Kashmiri Shaivites put them at the top of their world model. In his philosophical treatise ƒ™≈õvara-pratyabhij√±ƒÅ-kƒÅrikƒÅ, Utpaladeva also rejects the vasana theory (the dream model of the world) of the SautrƒÅntika school of Buddhist philosophy; he suggests another model for idealism: ≈öiva, who is pure consciousness, manifests all objects internally, by virtue of his free will, svatantrya, and the objects appear as real and external to limited beings. He appeals to the analogy of the famed materialization of objects by advanced yogins, purely by using their psychic powers.The Dreamer and the Yogin, On the relationship between Buddhist and Saiva idealisms ‚Äì Isabelle Ratie, p. Tenets = ƒÄbhƒÅsavƒÅda and SvƒÅtantryavƒÅda = ƒÄbhƒÅsa (ƒÅ- ‚Äì slight, bhƒÅsa ‚Äì manifestation) ‚Äì i.e. appearance in a limited way, or \\"slight manifestation of ≈öiva\\" The Pratyabhijna Philosophy ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 37 is the Pratyabhijna theory of manifestation.The Trika Saivism of Kashmir ‚Äì M.L. Pandit, p. 189 The supreme consciousness (samvit) is like a mirror and the universe is like a reflection appearing in it.Sakti the Power in Tantra ‚Äì P.R. Tigunait, p. 65 The mirror analogy is often used to explain abhƒÅsa because a mirror, like consciousness, can contain an infinity of different images without being itself affected. Pratyabhijna affirms that the universe appears as an ƒÅbhƒÅsa in the mirror of supreme consciousness, samvit, but unlike a physical mirror which needs an external object to form a reflection, the image in the mirror of samvit is projected by samvit itself ‚Äì this activity is called svƒÅtantrya, power of will. In other words, the universe appears inside samvit because ≈öiva so desires. Advaita Vedanta proposes a somewhat similar theory of universe as an illusion superimposed on consciousness. The difference in Pratyabhijna is that the cause of manifestation is not an eternal separate principle of ignorance (avidyƒÅ), but the will of ≈öiva, and the creation itself is ontologically real, not just an illusion.The Trika Saivism of Kashmir ‚Äì M.L. Pandit, p. 190 It is made of ƒÅbhƒÅsas, which are nothing but the ideation of ≈öiva appearing as empirical objects. Thus, all things are ƒÅbhƒÅsa: earth, water, fire, etc. All their qualities are ƒÅbhƒÅsa.Doctrine of Divine Recognition ‚Äì K.C. Pandey, p. 159 Complex ƒÅbhƒÅsas are compose from simpler ƒÅbhƒÅsas, culminating with the whole world.The Himalayan mysticism ‚Äì R. Nataraj, p. 186The Trika Saivism of Kashmir ‚Äì M.L. Pandit, p. 188 Paradoxically, even though ƒÅbhƒÅsas have the nature of consciousness, they also exist externally on account of being manifested through the occultation power (maya) by ≈öiva.Doctrine of Divine Recognition ‚Äì K.C. Pandey, p. 115 An advanced meditator is capable of seeing the world as ƒÅbhƒÅsa, a flash of consciousness (cit) and bliss (ƒÅnanda), identical with his own self (ƒÅtman) and non-differentiated (abheda). In other words, the light of consciousness shines from within the object of perception, as an intuition, a super-human direct kind of vision.The Isvarapratyabhijnakarika of Utpaladeva ‚Äì R. Torella, p. 136 If the universe is contemplated from the point of view of manifestation, it appears as ƒÅbhƒÅsa, but when contemplated from the point of view of the Ultimate Reality, it appears as svƒÅtantrya. SvƒÅtantrya is the complementary concept of ƒÅbhƒÅsa accounting for the initial impulse of manifestation. The theory of svƒÅtantrya affirms that ≈öiva, the fundamental Reality, appears as distinct subjects and objects, but this does not conceal his real nature. Thus, the free will of ≈öiva, which is absolute unity, is to manifest, to create multiplicity. This impulse to create is ≈öiva's playful nature (lilƒÅ). =The world= The ƒÅbhƒÅsa concept focuses on the essential nature of manifestation. In order to analyze in detail the nature of stuff (tattva - literally \\"that-ness\\") the Pratyabhijna system appropriated the 25 tattva ontology of Samkhya and improved on it by expanding the upper tattvas. Instead of Spirit (Purusha) and Nature (Prakriti), Kashmir Shaivism has five pure tattvas representing the Ultimate Reality and then six more representing the occultation process (mƒÅyƒÅa) which translates the non-dual pure Reality to time and space limited world and its subjects. =Soul= The soul (jivƒÅtman) is the projection of ≈öiva in manifestation. When taking on the five limitations (kancuka) the infinite spirit appears as integrated in space and time, with limited powers of action and knowledge and a sense of incompleteness. These five constrictions are the result of the action of an impurity called anava mala. Its function is to make the unlimited appear as limited and severed from the whole. This does not mean that jivatman is limited, it just appears so on account of ignorance.The Pratyabhijna Philosophy ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 32 Jivatman is not created or born, but rather has the same status as ≈öiva, performing on a small scale the same actions that ≈öiva performs on a universal scale ‚Äì creation, maintenance, dissolution, occultation and grace.The Pratyabhijna Philosophy ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 18 However, his powers are circumscribed by malas.Saivism Some Glimpses ‚Äì G. V. Tagare, p. 12 In order to open Jivatman towards external objects it is placed within the subtle body, also known as the mental apparatus or puryastaka ‚Äì the eight gated fortress of the soul. The eight gates are the five elements ‚Äì earth, water, fire, air, aether plus the sensorial mental (manas), ego (ahamkara) and intellect (buddhi).Saivism ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 13 Jivatman is further limited by two more impurities, in addition to the first one, anava mala ‚Äì the limitation of atomicity. Through the next impurity, mayiya mala, things appear as dual / differentiated. The limited subject, jivatman, is immersed in a world full of external objects, in a fundamental duality between self and non-self. Furthermore, through the third impurity ‚Äì karma mala ‚Äì the subject has the illusion that he is the doer, though, limited in power. Atman, by contrast, when acts, is identified with ≈öiva and acts as a part of ≈öiva. That is why the limited soul is described as enslaved (pasu) while ≈öiva is the master (pati). By purification of the three impurities the limited soul too can recognize (pratyabhijna) his real nature, becoming pati himself. =Impurity= The mƒÅla (meaning \\"dirt\\" or \\"impurity\\") Saivism ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 14 theory states that the infinite self, atman, is reduced and limited by three forces produced by ≈öiva. ≈öiva, by exercising his free will ‚Äì svƒÅtƒÅntrya, takes contraction upon himself and manifests as countless atoms of consciousness (cida·πáu ‚Äì consciousness quantas).The Philosophy of Sadana ‚Äì D.B. Sen Sharma, p. 107 Cida·πáu are enwrapped by material vestment.The Philosophy of Sadana ‚Äì D.B. Sen Sharma, p. 108 As discussed above, the three malas are ƒÅ·πáava mƒÅla ‚Äì the limitation of smallness, mƒÅyƒ´ya mƒÅla - the limitation of illusion and kƒÅrma mƒÅla ‚Äì limitation of doership.Meditation Revolution ‚Äì D.R. Brooks, p. 433 KƒÅrma mƒÅla exists in the physical body, mƒÅyƒ´ya mƒÅla in the subtle body and ƒÅ·πáava mƒÅla in the causal body.Meditation Revolution ‚Äì D.R. Brooks, p. 439 Anava mala affects the spirit and contracts the will, mayiya mala affects the mind and creates duality, karma mƒÅla affects the body and creates good and bad actions. They correspond to individuality, mind and body.The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 128 Of the three limitations, only the first one, ƒÅnava mala, which is the basis of the other two, is impossible to surpass through effort alone, without the help of divine grace (≈öaktipat).Meditation Revolution ‚Äì D.R. Brooks, p. 437 Anava mƒÅla is manifested as residual impressions existing in the causal body (subconscious mind).The Philosophy of Sadana ‚Äì D.B. Sen Sharma, p. 127 It is the combined effect of the five limitations (kancuka) taken together,The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 131 the gateway from limited towards the unlimited, from the pure-impure (bheda-abheda) world of the ego towards the pure reality of the first five tattvas, culminating with ≈öiva and ≈öakti. Mayiya mƒÅla manifests as the mind. In Pratyabhijna, the mind is seen as the root of illusion.Shiva Sutras ‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 18 The concept of mind here is different from Buddhism. In Buddhism, mind collates the aspect of awareness. Here, it is only related to the activity of thought forms, emotions, ego and the five senses. Thus, all cognitions being limited perceptions of the absolute, are illusions, on account of containing a sense of duality. KƒÅrma mƒÅla manifests the physical body. Its essence is limitation of the power of action and the illusion of individual agency, the effect of which is the accumulation of karma in the causal body. The maturity of malas of a person is related to the level of grace (≈õaktipƒÅt) he is able to receive. With dedicated practice, kƒÅrma mƒÅla and mƒÅyiya mƒÅla can be surpassed, but then the practitioner must put his fate in the hands of ≈öiva, as ≈öiva alone can bestow the grace of lifting anava mƒÅla and helping him recognize (pratyabhijnƒÅ) his essential nature. =Liberation= In Pratyabhijna, the concept of liberation (moksha) is the recognition (pratyabhijnƒÅ) of the original, innate awareness of self in which all this universe appears as ≈öiva-consciousness. That liberated being also attains what is called cidƒÅnanda (consciousness-bliss). In its highest form, this bliss is known as jagadƒÅnanda, literally meaning the bliss (ƒÅnanada) of the whole world (jagat). In jagadƒÅnanda the universe appears as the Self (ƒÅtman).Siva Sutras ‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 244 In a practical way the definition says that, when there is no need to sit in meditation for samƒÅdhi, that is jagadƒÅnanda,Mysticism In Shaivism And Christianity ‚Äî B. Baumer, p. 253 because then nothing except the supreme consciousness (samvit) is perceived. The mind rests in the unlimited consciousness the inside becomes outside and vice versa, and there is a sense of oneness and total immersion.Possession, Immersion, and the Intoxicated Madnesses of Devotion in Hindu Traditions ‚Äì Marcy Goldstein, p. 234 No matter what the liberated being is doing (eating, walking, even sleeping), he experiences bliss of the deepest level.Miracle of Witness Consciousness ‚Äì Prabhu, p. 124 Spiritual practices The purpose of Pratyabhijna is the recognition of the ≈öiva nature of the world (and oneself). In order to achieve that, it is necessary to induce a modified state of consciousness through the use of ≈öakti. ≈öakti, loosely translated as energy, is the dynamic aspect of ≈öiva, the link between finite (the human subject) and infinite (≈öiva). Thus comes about the fundamental principle: \\"Without the help of ≈öakti, Pratyabhijna is impossible\\".Mysticism In Shaivism And Christianity ‚Äì B. Baumer, p. 183 In order to awaken ≈öakti, the practice of \\"unfoldment of the middle\\" is prescribed. The middle has multiple meanings here: in its most basic form, it refers to the psychic channel passing through the spine (Sushumna Nadi) which is physically the central axis of the body. Unfoldment in the Sushumna Nadi is achieved by focusing the ascending breath (prana) and descending breath (apana) inside it. Thus, the two opposing tendencies being fused together a state of non-differentiation is achieved and the Kundalini energy ascends.The Stanzas on Vibration ‚Äì M.S.G. Dyczkowski, p. 207The Pratyabhijna Philosophy ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 125 Another meaning of the \\"middle\\" is that of void or emptiness, but it does not refer to a lack of cognition, rather, it is a lack of duality in cognition. There are three principal manifestations of the void in the body: the lower one ‚Äì void of the heart ‚Äì associated with heart chakra, the second one is the intermediary void associated with the channel Sushumna Nadi and the third void is called \\"supreme\\" and associated with the crown chakra. To unfold these three voids entails a number of practices of focusing and surrender of consciousness in those three places. A third meaning of \\"middle\\" is \\"the state which exists in- between cognitions, when one thought has ended and another one has not yet begun\\". These moments are considered essential for the revelation of the true nature of the mind. The usual practices are: dual thought destruction (vikalpa ksaya), withdrawing of the cognitive energies into the heart (≈õakti-sa·πÖkoca), expansion of non-dual awareness into the external perceptions (≈õakti-vikƒÅsa) and generating hiatus moments in thinking, when the pure awareness of the Self might be easier to apprehend (vaha-cheda). Let us review a few of the most important practices in more detail: =Panca-kritya ‚Äì meditation on the five actions= Panca-Kritya is a general practice which underlies all the other practices. An essential feature of Kashmir Shaivism is the concept of activity inside the ultimate consciousness. ≈öiva acts, and his most important actions are five in number: creation, maintenance, dissolution, occultation and grace. But the limited beings are identical to ≈öiva, as nothing but ≈öiva exists, so, they too have the same five actions, on a limited scale. These five actions are the object of meditation. They are associated with all the stages of cognition: creation is the initiation of a perception or thought, maintenance is dwelling on it, dissolution is returning of consciousness in its center. Then, the last two actions are associated with the movement towards duality and non-duality The purpose of the meditation on the five actions is their dissolution into the void. This process is described with such metaphors as \\"hathapaka\\" meaning violent digestion, devouring something whole, in one gulpThe Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 327 and \\"alamgrasa\\" ‚Äì complete consumption of the experience.The Awakening of Supreme Consciousness ‚Äì J.K. Kamal, p. 60 In practice, a state of non-duality (Turiya) is over- imposed over the normal cognitions of daily life.The Shiva Sutra Vimarsini of Ksemaraja ‚Äì P.T.S. Iyengar, p. 50 Pratyabhijna is not focused on formal practice, but rather it is a philosophy of life. All moments of life are good for pa√±ca-k·πõtya practice, as all cognitions can lead to the revelation of the Self. As experiences accumulate into the subject, they are to be burned into sameness.The Pratyabhijna Philosophy ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 90 Through this device the karmic element is eliminated from one's actions, or, in other words, duality is digested out of experiences.The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 147 This process is one of microscopic, moment by moment noticing of experience and reframing it into the perspective of the non-dual subject.The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 146 All experiences tend to leave subconscious traces, especially the negative ones. Such experiences are reduced to a \\"seed form\\", to spring forth again into existence, becoming memories or patterns of behavior.The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 145 Whenever blocks arise in life, one should know they are just inside his consciousness and perform hathapaka to dissolve them.The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 262 This is in no way an analytical or dry activity. As this practice advances, a feeling of spontaneous delight (camatkara), not unlike an artistic experience, consumes the object of the experience spontaneously, as it appears.The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 144 The body itself it charged with an intense state of bliss and consciousness is expanded beyond duality. In this state the aim of Pratyabhijna is realized inside the purified body and mind of the practitioner. =Vikalpa-kshaya ‚Äì dissolution of dualizing thought= The most direct application of Panca-kritya (the observation of the five actions of consciousness) is Vikalpa Kshaya, literally meaning \\"dissolution of thoughts\\".The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 305 It is an activity by which the dualizing content of cognitions is dissolved into Atman, which is nondual by excellence.The Pratyabhijna Philosophy ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 34 What remains is called avikalpa, that is, pure awareness.The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 173 A similar concept is citta-vrtti- nirodha The Secret of Self Realization ‚Äì I.K. Taimni, p. 63 ‚Äì the cessation of mental fluctuations. This verse is the famous definition of yoga from Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. There is also similarity with Vipasana,The Pratyabhijna Philosophy ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 124 the Zen and Dzogchen traditions.The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 174 By focusing on the pure awareness substrate of cognition instead of the external objects, the practitioner reaches illumination. Dualizing thought constructs must be eliminated and in their place the light and ecstasy of pure awareness shines as the real nature of cognition. Repeating the gesture of vikalpa-ksaya with all thoughts, as they appear, there is a gradual transformation at the subconscious level (causal body), leading towards identity with ≈öiva. Thus, the process resembles the pruning of the weeds in a garden. Vikalpa-ksaya is also the classical technique for calming the agitated mind. In order to capture the underlying consciousness on the surface of which vikalpas have their play, the yogi enters a state of surrender, or, in other words an \\"alert passivity\\", because the use of force in this case would only lead to more mental agitation. As vikalpas are being consumed in the light of consciousness, ananda also appears. An accumulation of repeated experiences of identification with Atman in a state of intoxication with bliss form the foundation for stable samadhi.The Pratyabhijna Philosophy ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 105 A number of practical suggestions are offered in the Pratyabhijina texts: to concentrate on dvadasanta (above the crown chakra),The Pratyabhijna Philosophy ‚Äî G.V. Tagare, p. 104 to enter the void that exists between the moment one thought ends and another appears,The Pratyabhijna Philosophy ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 104 or similarly, on the space existing between inhalation and exhalation and to concentrate on an intense artistic emotion. =Vaha-cheda ‚Äì cutting of the inner energy currents= Vaha-cheda (cutting the two vital currents, prana and apana) leads to illumination by resting the ascending and descending vayus in the heart.The Pratyabhijna Philosophy ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 103 By bringing a cessation to the dualizing activity of prana and apana, equilibrium is reached, and in this superior condition the true nature of the heart shines forth.Introduction to Kasmir Shaivism, p. 82 A cryptic indication is to mentally pronounce consonants such as \\"K\\" without the supporting vowel (\\"a\\"). This paradoxical concept acts as a mechanism to induce a moment of hiatus in the mental activity, when the tension and pain are cleared.The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 179 Such a technique belongs to the anavopaya (the lowest of the three categories of techniques in Kashmir Shaivism). =≈öakti-sankoca ‚Äì contraction of the sense energies in the heart= Sakti- sankocah is an illumination technique based on the activation of the heart (the locus of projection of Atman) by retraction of one's energies back into their source. After letting the sense-organs reach to external objects, by bringing them back into the heart, all the energies of the five senses are accumulated inside (pratyahara). Just like a scared tortoise brings its limbs back into the shell, so the yogi should retract his ≈öaktis (energies of the senses) into Atman.The Pratyabhijna Philosophy ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 102 This reversal of the sense organs is intended to awaken the recognition of the real nature of the heart.The Pratyabhijna Philosophy ‚Äì G.V. Tagare, p. 101 =≈öakti-vikasa ‚Äì recognition of the self into the sense objects= Sakti- vikasa is a method to dissolve duality (vikalpa ksaya) out of the stream of sensorial impressions. While being engaged in the sense activity, the yogi should remain centered in Atman (his heart), thus superposing the external perceptions onto the light of is revealed heart. This mental attitude is also called Bhairavi Mudra. Its effect is the realization of the nonduality of the external reality by recognizing the same essential nature (Atman, or ≈öiva) in all cognitions. Thus, the yogi attains stabilization of his nondual vision through systematic practice. Both ≈öakti-sankoca and ≈öakti-vikasa are considered shaktopaya techniques ‚Äì the intermediary category, of the mind. =Adyanta-koti-nibhalana ‚Äì meditation on the moment between breaths= There is a class of techniques which use two special moments in the breath cycle to achieve recognition of one's nature. If we consider the polarity of the upward moving current (prana) as positive, and the opposing current (apana) as negative, then the polarity of the inner energy currents reach zero ‚Äì equilibrium ‚Äì in the moments of rest between inhalation and exhalation. Those moments are targeted with the mental recitation of the two syllables of the ajapa mantra so'ham or ham-sah. The locus of attention should be in the regions of the heart (anƒÅhata) and above the crown (dvƒÅda≈õƒÅnta).The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism ‚Äì S.Shankarananda, p. 306 The continuous movement to and fro of awareness in-between these two centers, which are associated with two manifestations of the void ‚Äì the void of the heart and the supreme void, brings about the activation of the median channel (sushumna nadi) and a state of non-duality.

He ruled the County of Gorizia from 1454 until his death.  Life  John II was the eldest son of Count Henry VI of Gorizia (1376‚Äì1454) from his second marriage with Catherine, daughter of Nicholas II Garai (Mikl√≥s Garai), Palatine of Hungary. Under the long rule of his father, the County of Gorizia had suffered a steep decline. Henry had first married Elizabeth (d. 1436), a daughter of Count Hermann II of Celje, and after her early death remained a loyal ally of the Counts of Celje. He and Count Ulrich II of Celje signed an inheritance treaty in 1437, which brought him in conflict with his mighty neighbors, the Republic of Venice and the Habsburg duke Frederick V of Austria (later Emperor Frederick III), and even with his second wife. Henry agreed to betroth his son John to Elizabeth of Celje, the daughter of Count Ulrich II, a project that ulimatively was not realized. Elisabeth was betrothed to Matthias Corvinus, future king of Hungary, in a futile attempt to reconcile the houses of Celje and Hunyadi. Elisabeth died in her teens, and John remained unmarried. Young John was held hostage in Celje from 1444, together with his younger brother Leonhard. As future correspondence with Katarina Brankoviƒá, last countess of Celje, shows, the relation between the young G√∂rz princes and the Celje court were cordial. Their captivity can be seen as an attempt to keep the Counts of Gorizia within the Celje power orbit. Such alliance was strongly favored by the boys' father, but opposed by their mother, Catherine Garai, who despite being related to the Celjes, favored the Habsburgs. After his release upon his father's death in 1454, John took up government in Gorizia. In November 1456, he was part of the entourage of Ulrich II of Celje and Ladislaus the Posthumous that was supposed to take over Belgrade Fortress from Hunyadi troops that had just repelled an Ottoman siege. Ulrich was assassinated by the Hunyadis, and John went on to claim the extinct Ortenburg estates in the Duchy of Carinthia (around Millstatt and Spittal an der Drau), which were bordering the Gorizia palatine county in the upper Drava valley. However, his claim was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, he went on to occupy and plunder the Ortenburg lands, until he was finally defeated by the Habsburg forces of Emperor Frederick III in 1460, under the command of the Bohemian condottiere Jan Vitovec who had previously served the Counts of Celje. A peace treaty was signed at Feldsberg Castle, whereupon Count John was forced to renounce the Ortenburg estates and to cede twelve Gorizia fortresses as a reparation, including his Lienz residence at Bruck Castle. His brother, with the help of the advisor Virgil von Graben, was able to reclaim the latter after pledging alliegance to the Habsburgs. John II died in 1462 at his Lienz residence and was deeply mourned by his subjects, due to him having been very popular. He was succeeded by his younger brother Leonhard. With Leonhard's death in 1500, the House of Gorizia went extinct.

At the 1913 County Council elections they responded to Labour allowing the Progressives a free run in Bow & Bromley by fielding two of their own candidates instead. Though they polled well, the result of their intervention was to hand the seats to the Municipal Reform Party. The BSP adopted the same strategy for this by-election and chose Jack Jones to stand as their candidate. In the 1906 general election, Jones unsuccessfully stood for Camborne. In 1911, he became a trade union organiser, for the National Union of General Workers. Campaign The Unionist campaign was given a boost by the Conservative by- election victory in nearby Bethnal Green South West declared the day before polling day. Result Yeo Aftermath A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the autumn of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place. *Liberal:Alfred William Yeo *Unionist:} *endorsed candidate of the Coalition Government. References * Craig, F. W. S. (1974).

It was written by series creator Neil Jordan and directed by Simon Cellan Jones. It originally aired on April 10, 2011. The episode deals with Cardinal della Rovere's having fled to the Kingdom of Naples in fear for his life, and in search of support for his plot to depose the Pope. In Rome, the Pope attempts to find a suitable husband for Lucrezia, and takes in a Prince from Constantinople. Plot Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere (Colm Feore) arrives in Naples and is given an audience with King Ferrante (Joseph M. Kelly) and Prince Alfonso (Augustus Prew). When the Pope (Jeremy Irons) learns of his arrival in Naples, he asks his son Cesare (Fran√ßois Arnaud) if he knows of someone who could kill the Cardinal. della Rovere and Alfonso discuss deposing the Pope, with della Rovere offering to recognize the independence of Naples (from the claims of Spain and France), should he be elected Pope when Alexander is deposed. Alfonso is not convinced, as he believes Naples is already a proven free kingdom. He takes della Rovere to a dining room, where King Ferrante had his enemies stuffed and put on display, as a warning to anyone who would cross him. Meanwhile, in Rome, the Pope discusses the Vatican's financial woes with his sons Cesare and Juan (David Oakes). He suggests taking in the marranos, which have recently been exiled from Spain by Queen Isabella, at a high price. While emptying della Rovere's estate, Cesare meets with Micheletto (Sean Harris) and tells him to travel to Naples to assassinate the Cardinal. When Micheletto arrives in Naples, he hides in the dining room among King Ferrante's stuffed enemies until night falls, but before reaching della Rovere's room, he sees two guards posted outside and retreats. Reforming his plan, he attempts to kill della Rovere at a sulphur bath, but is discovered by the Cardinal, recognizing Micheletto's badly scarred back. In Rome, the Pope introduces his 13 new Cardinals in a ceremony at the Vatican. Micheletto barely escapes the baths, and della Rovere is expelled from Naples by Alfonso. The Pope consults Giulia Farnese (Lotte Verbeek) and Cesare on a request from the Sultan of Constantinople to house his half brother, Prince Cem (Elyes Gabel), for 40,000 ducats a year. In dire need of finances, they decide to accept Djem, even though he is a Muslim. When Cem arrives, he instantly develops a friendship with Lucrezia (Holliday Grainger) and Juan, whom he calls his \\"Christian brother\\". While Juan and Lucrezia entertain Djem, the Pope and Cesare begin the search for a husband for Lucrezia. While they have received offers from all over Christendom, the Pope and Cesare agree that to sustain the papacy, her husband must be Italian. While watching Cem and Juan practice swordplay, the Pope reveals to Cesare that the Sultan offered him 400,000 ducats if Djem were to die while in their care. The Pope meets with representatives for several suitors of Lucrezia, but during the meetings, he sees Lucrezia dancing with Djem. He decides that she will be married to Giovanni Sforza (Ronan Vibert), to secure a union with Milan, and to ensure that della Rovere is turned away from Milan on his road to France. Juan comes to Cesare, in search of Micheletto's services. Cesare quickly deduces that the Pope intends to kill Djem and use the money from the Sultan to pay Lucrezia's dowry. He refuses Juan's request, knowing that Lucrezia loves Djem and would miss him at her wedding. Juan, now unable to use Micheletto, plots with a cook to poison Djem's tea with cantarella. During a small gathering the following day, Cem drinks the poisoned tea, and quickly falls ill, but does not die as Juan expected. After consulting Micheletto, who tells them Cem will be in agony for weeks, Cesare makes Juan finish what he started. Juan enters Cem's room and smothers him with a pillow.

Reston Station is a transit-oriented, mixed-use, urban employment center in the community of Reston in Fairfax County, Virginia. It is being developed through a public- private partnership between Fairfax County and Comstock Partners LC. The development, which provides access to the Wiehle‚ÄìReston East Metro station, consists of a subterranean Metro parking facility beneath a public plaza surrounded by office and residential high-rise buildings. The Reston Station underground garage delivered as part of Phase 1 of the Silver Line in July 2014, on the same day that Metro's Silver Line began service. It is the only parking structure and transit-oriented development fully integrated with any of the Phase 1 expansion stations. After the opening of the Metro station, construction commenced on the buildings located on the plaza. Future development with residential, office, hotel, and retail uses is planned for the properties around the existing plaza and Metro station. Development Reston Station will integrate more than 1.3 million square feet of mixed-use development consisting of more than 500,000 square feet of Class A office space, approximately 100,000 square feet of restaurants, shops, and service- oriented retailers, a 200-plus room hotel, and approximately 900 luxury residences. The Reston Station Metro Facility includes a commuter kiss and ride facility, a 10-bay transit bus depot, 2,300 commuter parking spaces, and a large secure bike room. Vertical transportation through the garage and the bus level leads visitors to Reston Station Plaza, which connects directly to the pedestrian overpass via which passengers cross the westbound lanes of the Dulles Toll Road to enter the Metro station situated in the median. The Reston Station Metro garage facility construction project was one of the biggest of its type east of the Mississippi River. It required the excavation of over 500,000 cubic yards of dirt and over one million man hours to construct. Development of an additional 1.3 million square feet on 8.4 acres north of Reston Station Boulevard (\\"Reston Station Promenade\\") was approved April 10, 2018. Comstock plans to begin construction on this next phase in early 2020. Reston Metro Plaza The Reston Metro Plaza began development in June 2014 directly above the Reston Station Metro Facility and adjacent to the Silver Line Metro Station. Once completed, it will form the core of the greater Reston Station neighborhood; it includes multiple buildings connected by civic spaces dedicated to public activities throughout the year. Five buildings are planned, including office, residential, hotel and retail spaces. The first construction on the plaza was a high-rise apartment building. Comstock initially stated that construction of the office buildings would be phased and some or all would not begin without tenants signing leases (as a way to reduce risk and ensure costs are recouped). However, in 2015 Comstock began building the first of the three office buildings without any signed tenants, and ultimately signed leases on all three buildings in 2019. Reston Row In 2020, Comstock completed its acquisition of the property between Sunset Hills Road and Reston Station Boulevard, where it plans to develop a second phase, the \\"Reston Row District.\\" Planned buildings include a Marriott hotel, apartments, and two office buildings. The development will also feature parking, retail space and parks.

A reissue of the album was released on November 20, 2012 featuring two new songs. Critical reception The album received mostly positive reviews, but also mixed reviews from several critics. Zach Redrup from Dead Press! rated the album positively calling it: \\"For someone who is somewhat sceptical about the majority of metalcore that makes its way out of America these days, I would say that this is fairly good. It definitely packs all the better elements of the genre into a neat bundle that even your grandmother can get on with. It's well executed, a bit plain, but generally far from boring. Even if metalcore isn't your game you should give this a go. Who knows? You might be like me and discover a new band that you actually quite like.\\" KillYourStereo gave the album 30 out of 100 and said: \\"Like Moths To Flames have offered up a completely generic sounding record without a single attempt at originality, which these days, is just simply unacceptable.\\" New Transcendence gave the album a score 4/5 and saying: \\"The bottom line about this album is: If you thought you liked the band or even KNEW you liked the band when you first heard them, you will LOVE them now. The high-energy, aggressive in your face band they were in the beginning is completely revamped and recharged on this album.

Public health nurses (PHNs) or community health nurses \\"integrate community involvement and knowledge about the entire population with personal, clinical understandings of the health and illness experiences of individuals and families within the population.\\" Public health nursing in the United States traces back to a nurse named Lillian Wald who, in 1893, established the Henry Street Settlement in New York City and coined the expression \\"public health nurse\\". Public health nurses work within communities and focus on different areas to improve the overall health of the people within that community. Some areas of employment for public health nurses are school districts, county or state health departments, and departments of correction. The public health nurse looks for areas of concern within the community and assesses and plans ways through which the concerns can be resolved or minimized. Some health concerns a public health nurse may work on are infection control, health maintenance, health coaching, as well as home care visits for welfare and to provide care to certain members of the community who may need it.  Credentials  All public health nurses are registered nurses. Some jobs do not require any further training beyond taking public health nursing courses. Others do require the individual to obtain a certification in public health nursing. One option is the National Board of Public Health Examiners' Certification in Public Health (NBPHE). This certification requires a bachelor's degree and five years of public health work experience. Another option was the Advanced Public Health Nursing Certification (PHNA-BC) but it is now only offered for renewal. Background Public health nurses (PHNs) represent the single largest group of public health practitioners working in the U.S. state health departments (SHDs) and local health departments (LHDs). Public health nursing (PHN) is a specialty practice within public health and nursing. ‚ÄúIt promotes and protects the health of populations using knowledge from various fields including nursing, public health, and the social sciences.‚Äù It addresses multiple determinants of health with a focus on improving overall population health, removing health disparities, and establishing social justice. Nursing practice involves policy development, planning, and advocacy with an emphasis on primary prevention, health equity, and addressing the unique needs of vulnerable sub-populations. Additional practice guidelines are detailed by the American Nurses Association Public Health Nursing: Scope & Standards of Practice. Areas of interest include but are not limited to infection prevention, immunization, environmental health, and opioid crises response. PHNs are vital to the delivery of essential public health services for populations, and often possess diverse skills to carry out job tasks related to clinical diagnostics and treatment, epidemiology, statistics, health promotion, disease surveillance, community health assessment and policy development. In addition PHNs frequently provide direct patient care for the vulnerable and underserved populations. Public health nurses deliver planned activities that require to protect and promote health in patients that require care. Public health is fundamental to the UK's philosophy for health achievement and attainment over time. It is a central feature of the contemporary health strategy which sets to prepare the way for the population's health and wellbeing up to 2030 and is widely accepted to be everyone's business.Ezhova, I., Sayer, L., Newland, R., Davis, N., Mcletchie‚ÄêHolder, S., Burrows, P., . . .

Journal of Clinical Nursing, 29(13-14), 2150-2160. doi:10.1111/jocn.15267 There are three main objectives for public health nurses: to prevent illness in individuals and promote healthy lifestyle, protect individuals from disease by the use of immunizations and by monitoring the disease process, and by creating long-term changes in communities through education and health promoting activities. Obviously, correct implementation of the nursing care program is vital in the process of educating and providing guidance to vulnerable families and community groups in order to empower family self-care.Tantut, S., Syahroni, B., & Turwantoko, T.

They put an emphasis on preventative care and basic health education (Arkansas State University, 2017). Their goal is to reduce disease and improve the quantity and quality of life of the general public (Arkansas State University, 2017). Public health nurses work in a variety of settings such as public health agencies, non-profit groups, and educational organizations (Arkansas State University, 2017). They collaborate with health planners and policy makers to make changes and act as an advocate for a particular community (Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services, n.d). They analyze the issues and patterns within a community and assist in developing interventions or strategies for more effective outcomes (Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services, n.d). (apaulCSU) Apart from prevention of illness, public health nurses also focus on the promotion of health and maintenance of the health of certain populations (Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services, n.d). Their role is to keep the public safe and respond to community needs. They provide a linkage between epidemiological data and clinical understanding of health issues (Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services, n.d). Public health education has been essential throughout the years for preventing certain conditions. Promoting vaccinations and infection control techniques has assisted the public in reducing contagious disease transmission (Arkansas State University, 2017). Nurses are needed at every aspect of public work from education campaigns to implementation of hygiene and sanitation initiatives (Arkansas State University, 2017).

Taschir(Thasia) historic region of Greater Armenia The name of Tashir of Armenian origin, (known as Tashiri in neighboring Georgia) this word known since classical antiquity, referring to the plateau between the Debed and Pambak rivers. It was first mentioned by the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi in his 5th- century monumental work History of Armenia, as one of the cantons of the lords of Gugark, a former province of Greater Armenia, which had become part of the Kingdom of Caucasian Iberia in 5th century and again part of kingdom of Georgia in 1118. Tashir was a part of Greater Armenia since 6-th century BC to 5-th century AD. After this, both Armenian and Iberian lords already had pretension over the land of Tashir, and it passed hands following the political fortunes of each. Tashir historically was a territory with Armenian majority. In the following centuries, the area was ruled mostly by Armenian lords. When the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia fell apart in the 10th century, the region was the basis of the Kingdom of Lori, or Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget (978-1118). It was conquered at the beginning of the 12th century by David IV of Georgia. It was a part of Georgia until the Mongol invasions devastated it and weakened the Georgian state. From then on, the region suffered many other invasions, lost much of its population and importance. It belonged to the domains of the noble Armenian Orbelian and was part of the Persian Empire until the Russian conquest of the Caucasus. The name of Tashir declined in use, and was replaced by that of Lori. Between 1918 and 1921, the region was again disputed between the newly independent states of Georgia and Armenia. The town of Tashir (Armenia) is named after the historical region.

The earthquake was located near the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), to the south of Lake Albert. Some sources put the epicenter in Uganda while some put it in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.8 and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Tectonic setting The earthquake occurred in the Mt Rwenzori region, which lies within the Western Rift Valley of the East Africa Rift System, between Lake Edward and Lake Albert. The Mt. Ruwenzori region is the most seismically active region in Uganda and also one of the most seismically active zones in the East Africa Rift System and is bounded by steep active normal faults.\\"The seismicity and tectonics of Uganda\\" by N. Maasha The calculated focal mechanism for the earthquake was normal faulting in type, although the focal mechanisms of three of the aftershocks were dominantly strike-slip in type. Damage Extensive damage was reported in both Uganda and the DRC. The earthquake caused 157 deaths: 104 in Uganda, 1 in Tanzania and 52 in the DRC. Buildings collapsed in both Uganda and the DRC. In Bundibugyo, the Court Hall was damaged. Cracks and fissures were observed on the ground. This earthquake could be felt in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, and Kenya. Landslides triggered by the earthquake blocked roads, impeding relief efforts. According to press reports, a strong aftershock on May 18, 1966, caused 90 deaths in the DRC. This aftershock caused damage to buildings in both Uganda and the DRC. Earthquake The earthquake was associated with of surface faulting showing a downthrow of about to the southeast, consistent with one of the two possible fault planes from the focal mechanism. The earthquake was preceded by numerous foreshocks on March 18 and 19, 1966, and was followed by many aftershocks during the next two months, nine of them with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater. The energy release of the main shock was about 2√ó1017 Nm. The energy release associated with aftershocks after April 18 was also significant. The sum of energy release of the aftershocks up to 45 days after the main shock was also about 2√ó1017 Nm, i.e. roughly equal to that of the main shock.

The film series was directed by Robert Lemelson and produced by Robert Lemelson and Alessandra Pasquino. Synopsis Shadows and Illuminations paints a portrait of Nyoman Kereta, a rural Balinese man in his late sixties who, by psychiatric standards, suffers from a psychotic-like illness. He experiences auditory and visual hallucinations that are a source of great distress, prevent him from tilling his rice fields, and isolate him from his family and fellow villagers. Through the lens of local Balinese standards, he is seen as haunted by spirit visitations that villagers interpret within the frame of their culture and religion. Shadows and Illuminations explores how unusual mental events and behavior can be understood or interpreted in multiple ways outside the confines of western psychiatric diagnostics. It looks at Nyoman's history of trauma and loss during the politically inspired mass killings that swept through Indonesia in 1965‚Äì66, his prolonged sickness from pesticide poisoning, and his treatment by traditional healers. The film illustrates how his wife's love and support have ameliorated his pain and helped him find peace in life with what the west terms \\"mental illness.\\" Total Running Time 34:36 minutes Awards * 2011 Best Shorts Competition, Award of Merit, Winner * 2011 Indie Fest, Award of Merit, Winner * 2011 Cine Golden Eagle Award, Winner * 2010 International Documentary Association Awards, Best Limited Series, Nominee External links *Afflictions: Culture and Mental Illness in Indonesia (Official Website) *Elemental Productions (Production Company) *Shadows and Illuminations (DER - Educational Distributor) *Shadows and Illuminations (IMDB) Category:Documentary films about mental health Category:2010 films ","title":"Shadows and Illuminations"},{"id":"35710138","text":"Macrosemimimus is an extinct genus of semionotiform ray-finned fish from the Late Jurassic of Germany, England and France.

The interior of the church contains an early-Renaissance choir screen, a stone pulpit and a monumental organ. The church has 1,250 seats. It is a Reformed church.Official website (in Dutch). The Construction The construction of the church took place in several phases: * Construction of a Romanesque church (12th century) * Construction of Early Gothic church (last quarter of 13th century) * Church gets a basilica choir (last quarter of 14th century) * Plan for a basilica nave fails (early 15th century) * The construction is completed (second half 15th century)  Graves  A common practice for old historic churches was to bury the dead under the Church. The Bovenkerk is no exception to this practice, where famous Dutch persons originating from Kampen are buried. One of them is Hendrick Avercamp (1585-1634), one of the first landscape painters of the 17th-century Dutch school, specialized in painting the Netherlands in winter. Another is Jan Bantjes (1700-1779) and Jacomina Leussen (1707-1770) who were wealthy landowners, shipowners, financiers of Berbice plantations and privateers. Their eldest son Gerrit (Jan Geerts) Bantjes (1734-1782) who left for the Cape of Good Hope in Nov.1754 started a line of descendants who laid down prominent South African history such as the exploratory Kommissitrek of 1834 to Port Natal to find a new homeland for the Cape Boers, the Natal-land Report which started The Great Trek (1837‚Äì38) and the battles that followed, the Discovery of the Witwatersrand Gold Reef in 1884 and the founding of Johannesburg in 1886. This same Bantjes line gave South Africa's first two presidents their grounding education and were instrumental in influencing the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) setting Germany and Great Britain on a collision course. Back to the church, the transept contains a small ornament of red marble with a green marble urn in memory of Vice Admiral Jan Willem de Winter (1761-1812). The heart of Vice Admiral De Winter is enclosed in this urn, while his body is buried in the Panth√©on in Paris.

Andree Farias of AllMusic found this album \\"large on huge choruses and a spirit that's rarely heard from singers with pipes this serious\\", and this allows her to let \\"her hair down this time around, singing sunny pop anthems about identity, faith, and her walk with God, tempered with enough ballads to keep the disc balanced.\\" At CCM Magazine, Grace S. Aspinwall noted that \\"from the single, \\"Finally Home\\" to the Katy Perry-esque \\"Masterpiece,\\" it's clear that Kerrie Roberts has done nothing but grow in the time since her debut release. Her voice has increased in strength and tone it blends nicely with upbeat arrangements and simple ballads.\\" At Christian Music Zine, Joshua Andre praised \\"Kerrie‚Äôs angelic voice [that] carries the entire album- even if it was an acapella album or with minimal instruments, I‚Äôd still buy it! With the 10 tracks split down the middle between upbeat frenetic dance anthems and slower reflective ballads, there is something on Kerrie‚Äôs album for everyone- take a squiz, everyone, you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised at how much Kerrie has raised the bar!\\" In addition, Andre vowed that the album \\"is a masterpiece\\". Cross Rhythms' Lins Honeyman called this \\"yet another powerhouse piece of work that highlights the sheer talent of one of CCM's top notch.\\" Jonathan Andre of Indie Vision Music called it \\"the most enjoyable yet equally profound and moving songs ever written and recorded throughout her career.\\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Mark Rice told that \\"Time For The Show met, or exceeded, my expectations in almost every way\\", and affirmed that Roberts has \\"some serious potential, and I have a feeling that she is only starting to discover it.\\" Louder Than the Music's Jono Davies found \\"this follow up is by far superior\\" to her debut release. Kevin Davis of New Release Tuesday said that the album \\"addresses themes of empowerment, strength, encouragement and joy delivered on waves of vibrant and contagious music ranging from high-energy pop to signature ballads beautifully expressed through tender, undeniable piano/vocal performances.\\" Lastly, Davis called the album \\"musically and lyrically...brilliant\\" because the album contains her \\"voice wrapped around extremely hooky dub-step electronic dance musical arrangements\\", which her \\"vocals are so strong and pure\\" on the release.

Biography The Jesuits established their first missions in Canada in the early decades of the 1600s and were assisted in Huronia by a number of new believers, amongst whom were Joseph Chiwatenhwa and his wife Marie Aonnetta, in addition to his brother Joseph and other members of the family, all of whom \\"lived and witnessed to their faith in a heroic manner.\\"Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops 2010 Chiwatenhwa was deeply moved by the Christian teachings of the Jesuit missioners in 1636 when he first encountered them, despite the fact that others of his Huron tribe blamed these missionaries for the epidemics that had broken out in Huron lands. :Chiwatenhwa himself fell sick; after his recovery, however, he was baptized, on August 16, 1637, by Father Jean de Br√©beuf, and given the Christian name Joseph. His wife, Aonette, was baptized on March 19, 1638; her Christian name was Marie. Their marriage was blessed on the same day; this was the first Catholic wedding in Huronia. Joseph became the first lay administrator in the Catholic Church in Canada, in 1639. He helped the Jesuits translate hymns and prayers from French into Huron. He was impressed with the teachings of Saint Ignatius and the Spiritual Exercises. During his eight-day silent retreat, he composed a prayer that reveals his profound experience with Jesus: \\"You love us so deeply that all I can do in return is to offer myself to you. I chose you as my elder and chief. There is no one else.\\" In adopting his new faith, Joseph drew on many of the spiritual and cultural teachings of his people; he entered the Catholic Church as a Huron. This helped him spread the Good News to many members of his family and tribe. Joseph Chiwatenhwa sensed that he might eventually be killed for his faith and love for Jesus Christ. He was martyred on 2 August 1640, aged 38. Jesuit martyr of North America (Canada) Gabriel Lalemant considered Chiwatenhwa a great catechist amongst his own people, \\"their apostle\\". After Joseph's martyrdom his family continued in the service of Christ in collaboration with the Jesuits, and more members of the Huron nation were baptised into the Catholic Church. :Pope John Paul II said at Huronia that \\"the worthy traditions of the Indian tribes were strengthened and enriched by the Gospel message ‚Ä¶ not only is Christianity relevant to the Indian peoples, but Christ, in the members of his Body, is himself Indian.\\" Let us be inspired by the faith of Joseph Chiwatenhwa, his wife, Marie Aonette, and their families. They believed in their brother and Saviour Jesus when he spoke the words recorded by Saint John (20:29): \\"You believe because you can see me. Happy are those who have not seen and yet believe.\\" (CCCB 2010)*  See also  *Kateri Tekakwitha  References  Category:1640 deaths Category:17th-century Roman Catholic martyrs Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from pagan religions Category:Native American Roman Catholics Category:Religious figures of the indigenous peoples of North America ","title":"Joseph Chiwatenhwa"},{"id":"35710396","text":"Great Expectations is the debut album by British singer-songwriter Tasmin Archer.

(2012). \\"News\\"Nautical archaeology Society Newsletter (Winter 2012). Tentatively dated to between 785-481 cal BC, the vessel has a distinctive form of naval architecture that has not been fully documented elsewhere in the ancient Mediterranean. This involved the use of long tenons that were initially fitted into mortice holes that passed through the keel plank over which multiple lines of planking were added, pegged into place with wooden treenails. From the albeit limited excavations, there do not appear to be any frames and consequently the long tenons may have provided the structural stability of the vessel through a kind of ‚Äòinternal framework‚Äô. As the structural elements of the wreck were made from the locally-available wood Acacia Totilis/Radiana, the team believes that shipwreck 43. Ship 43 was Egyptian in origin and thus probably involves a shipbuilding tradition that developed in accordance with the availability of local supplies of timber and the realities of nautical life at the margins of the Nile Delta. =The Western Marmarica Coastal SurveyWestern Marmarica Coastal Survey= The OCMA supports the Western Marmarica Coastal Survey (WMCS) to investigate the engagement of the Roman and Byzantine countryside with coastal trade in eastern Libya.Hulin, L. et al.

Instead, he played 5 games for the reserves as an over-age player (at most 4 born 1991 players were allowed).

Nocerina 2‚Äì0. The team also rested a number of players in order to prepare for the next match against eighth placed Brescia. On the same day that the first team played against Brescia, Albertazzi started for the reserves against Fiorentina in the second round of the playoffs on 5 May 2012. Albertazzi returned to the first team again on 2 June, for the away match of the promotion playoffs.Verona-Varese: i convocati 1 June 2012 He was named in the reserve squad for the playoffs quarterfinals held in the Province of Perugia, but did not travel with the team. He remained in the first team squad (for the finals first leg onlySampdoria-Varese: i convocati 05/06/2012) after the reserves were eliminated by Roma, but Albertazzi failed to make the starting lineup or the bench. =Hellas Verona= Albertazzi returned to Milan at the beginning of the 2012‚Äì13 season, being also named in 23-man squad for the pre-season TIM Trophy. However, on 31 July 2012 he was loaned to Serie B club Hellas Verona. Albertazzi was injured in his left knee from January to February 2013. Half of his registration rights, however, were purchased on 12 July 2013, for ‚Ç¨250,000. On 20 June 2014, Albertazzi returned to Milan after his full rights were acquired by the club. On 30 July 2015, Albertazzi joined Hellas Verona on a free transfer. In the 2015‚Äì16 Serie A season he made 10 appearances for the club. In August 2016, he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury that was not diagnosed in a timely manner and eventually left him out of play for the two consecutive seasons.

Weisburd (born 1954), is an Israeli/American criminologist who is well known for his research on crime and place, policing and white collar crime. Weisburd was the 2010 recipient of the prestigious Stockholm Prize in Criminology, and was recently awarded the Israel Prize in Social Work and Criminological Research, considered the state's highest honor. Weisburd holds joint tenured appointments as Distinguished Professor of Criminology, Law and Society at George Mason University. and Walter E. Meyer Professor of Law and Criminal Justice in the Institute of Criminology of the Hebrew University Faculty of Law, At George Mason University Weisburd was founder of the Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy and is now its executive director. Weisburd also serves as Chief Science Advisor at the National Police Foundation in Washington, D.C., and chair of its Research Advisory Committee. Weisburd was the founding editor of the Journal of Experimental Criminology, and is now the general editor of the Journal of Quantitative Criminology.  Research  Weisburd is a prolific researcher, who by 2018 had received more than $15 million in competitive grant funding and published over 25 books, 125 journal articles and 75 book chapters. Weisburd is best known for his work in place- based criminology, experimental criminology, and white-collar crime. Weisburd's research on place-based criminology has demonstrated the importance of focusing on the role geographic microplaces, such as street blocks, play in explaining crime. For instance, in a 1995 study in Jersey City, New Jersey Weisburd found that between 15% and 20% of all crime was generated by 56 drug market hot spots. In a recent longitudinal study of crime concentrations in Seattle, Washington: Weisburd and his colleagues found that between 5% and 6% of street segments in the city generated over 50% of the crime incidents each year. Importantly, this research also showed that these crime concentrations remained stable across time and place over the 16-year study period. Weisburd has also replicated these findings in Tel Aviv, Israel, where almost the same levels of concentration were found as in his Seattle Study. In Weisburd's Sutherland Address to the American Society of Criminology in 2015 he argued that the consistency of crime concentrations across cities and across time was so great that it suggested a Law of Crime Concentration at Places. Weisburd's research has also repeatedly demonstrated the importance of these findings for crime prevention policy, particularly in the area of policing. With the focus on explaining crime through place-based factors, police and other crime prevention agencies have stable targets on which to focus their efforts. Beginning with a ground-breaking experimental study with Lawrence Sherman in 1995, Weisburd's research has repeatedly shown the efficacy of focusing police crime prevention resources on small hot spots of crime. Specifically, this body of research shows that crime and disorder is significantly reduced in targeted hot spots and that crime does not simply displace to nearby areas. In fact, Weisburd's research suggests that it is more likely that crime in nearby areas which received no extra police attention will also likely be reduced‚Äîa phenomenon that has been termed diffusion of crime control benefits. Weisburd's recent work has examined the impact of different types of police tactics in crime hot spots on people frequenting these targeted areas. One recent study examined the impact of police crackdowns on disorder on residents, while another focused on the New York Police department's usage of stop and frisks of suspicious persons. Related to this work, Weisburd has also advanced the importance of randomized controlled trials in evaluating crime and justice policies and programs. Randomized, experimental designs produce the most valid and reliable evidence on the impact of policies or interventions, and thus Weisburd argues the field has a moral imperative to use experimental designs whenever feasible. His work in this area has also shown that there is a paradox in experimental studies, in which increasing sample size often has the unintended consequence of reducing the observed statistical power of a study. Finally, Weisburd has also made significant contributions to our understanding of white-collar crime. In a large-scale empirical study of white-collar crime, he found that white-collar criminals were often from the middle classes, had multiple contacts with the criminal justice system, and that much white-collar crime was mundane and everyday in character.  Education  Weisburd started his college career at Shimer College, leaving in 1973 to attend Brandeis University. Weisburd graduated magna cum laude in 1976, with a B.A. in sociology from Brandeis University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Weisburd did his graduate studies at Yale University, where he received an M.A. in sociology in 1978, an M.Phil. in sociology in 1980 and a Ph.D. in sociology in 1985.  Academia  Weisburd is currently a distinguished professor of criminology, law and society at George Mason University and the Walter E. Meyer Professor of Law and Criminal Justice of the Hebrew University Faculty of Law, and Prior to these appointments at Hebrew University and George Mason University, Weisburd served as a member of the faculty at the University of Maryland, College Park from 2002 to 2008 and Rutgers University from 1985 to 1993. Weisburd has also had a number of visiting and honorary appointments. These include a visiting professorship appointment at the Key Centre for Ethics, Law, Justice and Governance at Griffiths University in Brisbane, Australia in 2004, visiting scholar at the University of Cambridge in 2007, and honorary professor at the Zehjiang Police College in Hangzhou, China in 2011. Weisburd has also held a number of research positions, in addition to his academic appointments. These included serving as a senior research associate at the Vera Institute in New York from 1984 to 1985, executive director of the Center for Crime Prevention Studies at Rutgers University from 1995 to 1996 (where Weisburd was also director from 1990 to 1995), senior research scientist at the Police Foundation in Washington, D.C. from 1997 to 2000 (where Weisburd is currently a senior fellow and chair of its research advisory committee), and visiting research fellow at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement in Leiden, the Netherlands from 2004 to 2006.  Awards and honors  Weisburd was awarded the Stockholm Prize in Criminology, the top honor in the field, in 2010. Weisburd has also been the recipient of numerous other awards and honors for his work in criminology and criminal justice. Most recently, he was awarded the Israel Prize in Social Work and Criminological Research, considered the state's highest honor. In 2014, Weisburd received the Edwin H.

She was constructed in Bombay Dockyard by Cursetjee Rustomjee to a design by Oliver Laing. Launched 21 April 1854, the ship took part in the bombardment of Bushire during the Anglo-Persian War before the amalgamation of the Indian navy with the Royal navy led to her being sold as surplus to requirements. She was purchased by shipping line owner Jock Willis who changed her name to The Tweed and converted her to entirely sail propulsion. On 18 July 1888 the ship was dismasted off Algoa Bay and was towed to shore, but a subsequent storm drove her aground and she was damaged beyond economic repair. Willis considered her to be a particularly fast ship. Although she was herself too large for the tea trade, he commissioned three clipper ships based on her hull design, Cutty Sark, Blackadder and Hallowe'en. Design and construction Punjaub was one of the last two frigates to be built for the Indian Navy, together with her sister ship, Assaye. Punjaub was slightly longer overall than Assaye and launched a month later. Design is credited to Oliver Laing, but is believed to originate from the lines of an old French frigate. Master builder at the yard was Cursetjee Rustomjee, who was the fifth generation of his family to run the yard, which had a reputation for building strong, fast ships.Lubbock p.211-213 The ships were constructed entirely of Malabar Teak. Each had two auxiliary engines driving a paddle wheel, one either side of the ship. Although giving the benefit of moving against the wind, the paddles had the disadvantage of reducing the ships' speed when under sail. At this period it was often necessary to reserve coal for occasional use because of cost and supply difficulties. Fitting out was delayed awaiting arrival of the engines from Britain. On 1 November Bombay was hit by a cyclone, which tore roofs off buildings, drove five square rigged ships, three steamers and 142 miscellaneous small ships aground. Assaye lost her bowsprit, broken against the castle walls. Indian History =In the Crimean War= The ship's first commander, John W. Young, took command 2 January 1855. At this point Britain was at war with Russia, and the ship was ordered to transport half of the 10th Hussars to the Crimea for use in the siege of Sebastapol. In six days the ship was equipped to house 250 horses for the journey. On 9 January she sailed for Suez together with the steam frigate Aukland, steam sloop Victoria and sailing transport Sultan, carrying the rest of the regiment. A second group of ships, Queen, Precursor, Earl of Claire, Earl Grey and Jessica carried part of the 12th Lancers also from Bombay while the rest of the regiment was brought from Mangalore by Assaye and Semiramis. Punjaub proved herself as a fast ship, having to reduce sail as well as not using steam, so the other ships could keep up. Commander Young and first officer Lieutenant Worsley were mentioned in dispatches for their effectiveness in the transport operation. =In the Anglo Persian War= On 11 May Commander Montriou was appointed commander, but as he was also Master Attendant of the dockyard, acting command fell to Lieutenant Alexander Foulerton. Punjaub became part of a squadron of nine warships under Rear Admiral Sir Henry Leeke on board Assaye, which was to land a force at Hallilah Bay as part of the Anglo-Persian War. Six steamers and 23 sailing ships also provided transport for 5,670 soldiers, 3750 non combatants, 1150 horses and 430 bullocks. The main force sailed from Bombay around 10 November, combined the whole force off Bunder Abbas on 24 November and landed troops on 6 December under cover of gunfire from the warships.Lubbock p.216-217 The expedition was hampered by a lack of landing craft for the artillery and animals but a beachhead was established in two days and the troops advanced northwards towards the village and fort of Reshire 4.5 miles away. Fighting proceeded house to house but the enemy were forced from the village on 9 November. The following morning an attack on Bushire began, with the ships getting in as close to shore as possible so as to bombard the town and stranding as the tide went out. The defenders artillery was generally less powerful, but damage was sustained by some of the closer ships. The British flag was raised over the residency at 5:30pm, the governor and important prisoners were taken on board Punjaub. Punjaub and assaye returned to Bombay.Lubbock p.218-219 During the journey news was brought of a Persian force of 3000 men assembling to attack the depot station on Kism island. The two ships diverted to bombard the gathered force, then transferring the prisoners to Assaye, Punjaub was left to continue the defence of Kism.Lubbock p.219 =the Indian uprising of 1857= During the Indian Revolt of 1857, Punjab moved troops to pacify a rebel colony. Part of the crew of the frigate involved themselves in ground missions, during 25 May-14 June in Calcutta to capture the last Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah; saving Dhaka from rebels on 22 November 1857. Reconstruction and renaming The Tweed In 1862, the Navy decided to replace both the Punjaub and the Assaye. On 8 February, Punjaub and on 31 March, Assaye set sail for England. Upon arrival, they were found surplus to requirements for the Royal Navy and sold off in 1863 to new owner John \\"Jock\\" Willis - a shipping tycoon and founder of John Willis & Sons of London, also called the Jock Willis Shipping Line. The Tweed moored in the Thames Jock Willis sold with profit Assaye, and converted the Punjaub, into a Clipper taking out her engines, changing her name to The Tweed after the river in his native county of Berwickshire in the Scottish borders with England. In addition, she was also fitted out with a new figurehead of Tam O'Shanter, a character from the Robert Burns poem. The new clipper, along with the Assaye and the Cospatrick, were hired in May 1864 by the British government for laying telegraph cables in the Persian Gulf. Jock Willis, then put The Tweed in the hands of his most capable officer, Captain William Stewart, who managed to squeeze the best out of her, and from 1863 to 1877, made numerous passages between London and the colonies, breaking records, and bringing great profits for the company.Lubbock, Basil.

He began his career with Walsall but struggled to break into the first team, joining West Bromwich Albion where he won promotion to the First Division in 1976. He later played for Leyton Orient, Cambridge United and Blackpool. Career Born in Tipton, Mayo never played football at school and only took up playing in his teens when he began playing local amateur football. He was spotted by Ken Hodgkisson who signed him for non- league side Dudley Town. However, Mayo \\"never really thought about\\" becoming a professional footballer and had begun working as a trainee accountant at Brookhouse Steel where he made copies of ledgers. While at Dudley, Mayo had an unsuccessful trial with Oxford United before being offered a trial with Walsall. He appeared for the club's reserve side in the Midland Intermediate League before being offered a professional contract in September 1972, at which time he left his accounting job. He made his professional debut for Walsall and appeared in seven league matches for the club but spent the majority of his time in the reserve side. During a reserve match against West Bromwich Albion, the club he supported, Mayo scored a hat-trick which convinced West Brom manager Don Howe to sign Mayo for ¬£17,000 in February 1973. He made his debut for the club in September 1973 as a substitute during a match against Hull City. He made over 90 appearances in all competitions for West Brom, helping the club achieve promotion to the First Division in the 1975‚Äì76 season. In March 1977, he joined Leyton Orient along with Allan Glover in a transfer deal that saw Laurie Cunningham move in the opposite direction. A year later, he was part of the Orient side that reached the semi-final of the FA Cup before losing to Arsenal. He joined Cambridge United in September 1981 for a fee of ¬£100,000 where he finished his professional career in 1983. Personal life Following his retirement from football, Mayo moved to North Wales and took ownership of the Plas Isa Hotel in Criccieth. He later worked in the tobacco industry. In 2015, Mayo appeared on series twelve of the reality television game show, Coach Trip, being named winner in the final.

Life He was a native of Edinburgh. The date of his birth is usually given as December 1782, but on the other hand the parochial register of Dollar, Clackmannanshire states that he died in 1829, aged 54. He received a classical education in the High School, Edinburgh, and in a private academy, and studied art under Alexander Nasmyth and in the Trustees' Academy, then taught by John Graham. From 1805 Gibson lived in Lambeth, exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1805, 1806, and 1807, and at the British Institution in 1811. In 1808 he was in Edinburgh, where he joined the Society of Associated Artists, to whose exhibitions he contributed till 1816, and he was represented in the modern exhibitions of the Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland in 1821 and 1822. In the earlier exhibition catalogues his name occasionally appears as \\"Peter\\" Gibson. In 1826 Gibson became a founder member of the Scottish Academy, to whose exhibitions he contributed (1827‚Äì9) landscape and architectural subjects, both Scottish and foreign. In 1824 he had been appointed professor of painting in Dollar Academy, and he died there on 23 August 1829. Works In his works in oil, Gibson founded his style on Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin. His water-colours were executed with washes of subdued pigments. He was also an etcher, and published in 1818 a series of six Etchings of Select Views in Edinburgh. Gibson contributed a comprehensive article on \\"Design\\" to the Encyclop√¶dia Edinensis; and articles on \\"Drawing\\", \\"Engraving\\", and \\"Miniature-painting\\" to the Edinburgh Encyclop√¶dia. His View of the Progress and Present State of the Arts of Design in Britain, in the Edinburgh Annual Register for 1816, noticed minor Scottish painters. He was author under the pseudonym of \\"Roger Roundrobin, Esq.\\", of a Letter to the Managers and Directors of the Royal Institution, Edinburgh in 1826. A treatise on Perspective, written shortly before his death, was printed but not published. Gibson also contributed to the daily press; and David Laing (Etchings of Wilkie and Geddes) attributed to Gibson a notice of Andrew Geddes's exhibition in the Edinburgh Evening Courant, 15 December 1821. Family In June 1818 Gibson married Isabella, daughter of William Scott, a teacher of elocution; and his wife is stated to have been a musician and the composer of the tune Comfort.

This came at the time when Imperial Germany had just begun to colonise the area and to establish German South-West Africa. When the Herero and Namaqua War of 1904‚Äì1907 broke out, Hoveka fought against the Germans. In 1905 he was interned at Otjihaenena concentration camp near Okatumba. After World War I Hoveka became engaged in early Pan-Africanism. He was one of the first Namibians to support and spread this idea and helped to set up the Windhoek office of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in 1922. In April 1946, the South African administration of South-West Africa held a referendum among the indigenous population to gather support for an incorporation of the area as its fifth province.

The referendum went in favour of the South Africans but was rejected by the UN General Assembly. Nikanor Hoveka and Hosea Kutako were the first to petition the United Nations about this issue.

History Emerging from associations with the hippy-orientated Here & Now, Nik Turner, Gong's Daevid Allen and Gilli Smyth, the Androids of Mu formed out of the Frestonia squatter community in Notting Hill Gate, West London, notable in its time for producing non-conformist music. The band's driving force was vocalist Suze da Blooze (11 February 1950 ‚Äì 19 August 2007). She shared lead vocals with Corrina, and wrote much of the band's material. They released one album, Blood Robots, recorded by F*** Off Records label-head Keith Dobson (Kif Kif le Batteur) in his Street Level studio. The Androids were well received by the music press of the day. Robbi Millar in Sounds described the album as \\"Android genius\\" and likened the band to The Slits, praising their \\"simple songs, played with limited but adventurous ability, sung with voices that scream and holler with the mispitched intensity of early Raincoats\\".Sounds, 4 October 1980, p. 39.

History The first alumni publication for BYU was the Alumni Announcer, which began publication in 1923. It was quickly replaced by another short-lived work in 1925, the Y Alumnus, which only survived until 1927. Nearly two decades later, in 1945, a new publication surfaced and was named the Brigham Young Alumnus. The new magazine achieved a circulation of 13,000 within its first year and, unlike is predecessors, continued being produced for many years. By 1968 the Brigham Young Alumnus was replaced by a tabloid newspaper named BYU Today. Following the tradition established by its immediate predecessor, BYU Today continued publication for well over two decades before becoming the Brigham Young Magazine in 1993. Immediately subsequent this name change, distribution of the magazine exceeded 130,000.

It was founded around 640, when Grandval already existed; Moutier grew up around the abbey. History The abbey was founded as a dependency of Luxeuil Abbey, on land granted by Gundoin, Duke of Alsace on the old route leading to the Pierre Pertuis Pass. The abbot of Luxeuil, Saint Waldebert, sent Saint Germanus of Granfelden, who served 35 years as the first abbot, with Saint Randoald of Grandval as his prior. Both were martyred in 675 by Adalrich, Duke of Alsace after they protested against his expulsion of the population of the Sorgenau valley. The abbey became, like some others, the secular ruler of a local territory, and by the 9th or 10th century had property and influence all the way to Lake Biel and into the Balsthal valley, but was regarded as a fief of the king. There was to be a long history of disputes over the property and privileges of the abbey, which later fell under the Dukes of Burgundy, who provided lay abbots, the priors or provosts being the senior monks. In 968 Conrad of Burgundy granted the abbey \\"in benefice\\" to Count Luitfrid, who then divided the property among his sons as though it had been granted in proprium, as property. After a court case it was returned to the king. In 999, Rudolph III of Burgundy presented the bishop of Basel with the abbey and its 540 square miles of lands,Wood, 285-286, 313 establishing the Prince-Bishopric of Basel as a secular territory; disputes with the Prince-bishops were to continue. According to legend, Bellelay Abbey was founded as a dependency in 1136, but as this belonged to the new Premonstratensian order the story seems unlikely. The abbey owned Corg√©mont, Tavannes and Perrefitte and other properties. From 1486 the abbey was also part of the Protectorate of Berne in the Old Swiss Confederacy, while remaining subject to Basel. From 1475 the Alsatian-born chronicler Johann Burchard, living in Rome, was provost. After the Swiss Reformation, the monks fled to Del√©mont, and between 1534-1792 the parish church there also served as their church. The arrival of French Revolutionary armies in 1792 ended both abbey and Prince-bishopric, and the buildings of the abbey have now disappeared, although some 12th century remains of buildings were discovered under the town in 2008.Local paper, in German However the small chapelle de Chali√®re, now serving as the cemetery chapel at Perrefitte, is a Carolingian building with faded 11th century wall-paintings that was built by the abbey.La chapelle de Chali√®re, Moutier municipal website, in French The major relics of the abbey were taken to Del√©mont at the Reformation, and the church there still has the bodies of Saints Germanus and Randoald, while the museum has Germanus's reputed cross (metal and enamel over wood, perhaps 9th century on older wood), sandals, and chalice (13th century, silver-gilt).Les Tr√©sors de Moutier-Grandval Moutier municipal website, in French = Moutier-Grandval Bible = Moutier-Grandval Bible, c. 840; the story of Adam and Eve from the Book of Genesis The Moutier-Grandval Bible is an illuminated manuscript bible of about 840, which was probably written in Tours, France, perhaps specially for the abbey. It was owned by them until the dissolution in the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was apparently forgotten and found in Del√©mont by children. It is now in the British Library (MS Addl. 10546). There are three full pages with miniatures, two showing scenes from the Book of Genesis: the story of Adam and Eve over several registers like a \\"strip cartoon\\", Moses receiving the Tablets of the Law and teaching them to the Israelites in two scenes, and an allegorical page with two scenes at the end of the book.Page from the British Library; All three pages with images; La Bible de Moutier- Granval (in French), Moutiers municipal website.

There is also a National Fish Health Center on the southwest side of Bozeman, near Montana State University, about away from the Fish Technology Center. Fish Technology Centers work with a wide variety of public and private partners to improve and conserve aquatic resources. Both the Fish Technology Center and the Fish Health Center are part of the National Fish Hatchery System, operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. There are seven Fish Technology Centers and nine Fish Health Centers in the United States. The Bozeman hatchery is the fourth oldest National Fish Hatchery. The hatchery was named to the National Register of Historic Places on January 6, 1983. The Bozeman National Fish Hatchery was authorized by an act of the United States Congress on August 5, 1892. The initial purchase of land for the hatchery was on May 20, 1893, and consisted of at the entrance to Bridger Canyon. Construction of facilities began April 1895 and was completed in late 1896. The first superintendent, Dr. James A. Henshall, began working there on January 11, 1897. The hatchery's original focus was on brook trout and rainbow trout (steelhead). The hatchery grew steadily and an additional were purchased in 1905. The fish hatchery focus ceased in 1966 when the hatchery became a Fish Cultural Development Center with a focus on improving Salmonidae culture. The focus changed again to cover a wider variety of fish species when it became a Fish Technology Center in 1983. Today, the center is more of a research and education center than a hatchery. Greenback cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki stomias) A significant accomplishment of the center was its instrumental role in getting the greenback cutthroat trout's rating under the Endangered Species Act changed from extinct to threatened. In August 2004 a new laboratory and administrative building known as the Robert G. Piper Building was opened, named in honor of a former director of the center. The Bozeman Fish Technology Center currently studies aquatic species culture, aquatic species nutrition, fishery evaluation, and aquatic species health in the states of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Utah, Colorado, and Kansas.

His ancestral name was Ying (Â¨¥), personal name Ying (ÁΩÉ), and Duke Kang was his posthumous title. History Duke Kang was one of the 40 sons of Duke Mu of Qin, and succeeded Duke Mu as ruler of Qin when he died in 621 BC. In the same year Duke Xiang of Jin also died, starting a succession crisis in Qin's neighbouring state Jin. Zhao Dun, the powerful minister of Jin, initially wanted to install Duke Xiang's younger brother Prince Yong on the Jin throne. Prince Yong was at the time exiled in Qin, and in 620 BC Qin sent an army to escort Yong back to Jin. However, Zhao Dun soon changed his mind and instead made Duke Xiang's young son Yigao the ruler, later known as Duke Ling of Jin. Jin then dispatched an army to stop Prince Yong, and defeated the Qin escort force at Linghu. The Jin succession dispute began a series of conflicts between Qin and Jin. A year after the battle at Linghu, Qin invaded Jin and took the city of Wucheng (Ê≠¶Âüé, in present-day Hua County, Shaanxi) in revenge. Two years later, in 617 BC Jin attacked Qin in return, taking Shaoliang (Â∞ëÊ¢Å, in present-day Hancheng, Shaanxi). Then in 615 BC Qin counterattacked again, taking Jima (ÁæàÈ¶¨). Jin dispatched an army to repel Qin, and the two forces met at nearby Hequ (Ê≤≥Êõ≤, present-day Fenglingdu, Ruicheng County), but both retreated without engaging in battle.

In 1908 he completed a PhD and then went to teach mathematics, machine industry and then mechanics at the University of Vienna. Fillunger pioneered the study of saturated ground and was made famous by an article published in 1913. He discovered the difference in behaviors of the effective and general stresses in samples of ground, opening the way for further research. He is considered to be a pioneer of the theory of liquid- saturated porous solids. Fillunger's theories put him in heated conflict with Karl von Terzaghi, who is often referred to as \\"father of soil mechanics\\", whom Fillunger was accused of slandering.

It is an adaptation of Boris Vian's 1947 novel Froth on the Daydream. The film received two nominations at the 4th Magritte Awards. It also received three nominations at the 39th C√©sar Awards, winning in one category. Plot Colin has a very pleasant life: he is rich, he loves the food his cook makes (Nicolas), he loves his pianocktail (portmanteau of piano and cocktail, a word invented by Vian) and his friend Chick. One day while having lunch with Chick, Chick tells him that he met a girl named Alise with whom he has a common passion: the writer Jean-Sol Partre (a spoonerism of Jean-Paul Sartre who was Boris Vian's friend). Colin meets Chloe at a party Chick invited him to. They fall in love, marry, but Chloe becomes ill during their honeymoon. As time passes, Chloe's condition deteriorates while the relationship between Chick and Alise turns sour. Frustrated with their own deteriorating relationships, Colin and Alise sleep with each other, although they both come to regret it shortly after. The aesthetic of the film changes from colorful and whimsical to monochromatic and tragic as the film progresses. These effects are observed most acutely in Colin's home, which decays supernaturally, and his mouse, who reluctantly tolerates the house until he abandons Colin. Colin spends his fortune on treating Chloe, which causes him to passionately fire his cook and sell his pianocktail, and he slips into poverty as Chloe passes away. His friend Chick spends both his and Colin's money on anything that has to do with Partre, and Chick loses his job due to a Partre-related incident and is later killed when resisting law-enforcement officers. Alise tracks down Partre himself and kills him. Afterwards, Alise disappears. Colin, Nicolas, and his fianc√©, Isis, hold a funeral for Chloe. Unable to bear the grief, Colin jumps into a river, sinking into the darkness.

The game follows a warrior named Crom, who lusts for revenge against the Celtic gods that betrayed his life of peace, making him slay his own family. Gameplay Bloodforge is a hack and slash game in which the player must use various weaponry to attack and defeat the enemy. To aid progress, the player is able to disorient their opponent (indicated by a specific icon appearing over the opponent's head), allowing Crom to perform a gruesome finishing move. Defeating opponents by using a finishing move will award the player more \\"Blood\\", which is used as in-game currency. Higher damage causes more Blood to be spilled, rewarding the player with the ability to upgrade their weapons and abilities. The four main weapons are the sword, war hammer, claws and a crossbow, each one allowing up to three upgrades. A green \\"Health\\" bar is displayed on the top left of the screen, above a red \\"Rage\\" bar. These bars are refilled by finding and using various Runes, usually found within breakable cairns Plot The game follows the story of Crom, a powerful and brutal Celtic warrior who leaves his life of violence behind in order to live in peace with his beautiful wife, Alena. Crom is at the end of a successful hunting trip. Resting, Crom dreams of a horrific encounter with Arawn, the king of the netherworld realm of Annwn. Crom awakens and rushes home to see his nightmare realised - his village aflame, ravaged by demons. Alena is nowhere to be seen. Crom lashes out at countless demons in search for his wife. He hears her cries and sees she is outside their home, surrounded. She calls out to him in fear as he rushes to her aid. Alena hurries inside the burning remains of their home. Consumed with fear and blinded by rage, Crom plunges his sword into the heart of yet another demon. Crom turns to face his previous foe in its true form: Alena. Disoriented and stricken with grief, Crom encounters the goddess Morrigan. She leads him to the shrine of his ancestors where he finds a mysterious gauntlet and is told that he must traverse the Bloodforge to gain vengeance. Crom accepts his fate, releasing his unrelenting fury on all those who oppose him. In order to discover the Bloodforge, Crom must massacre legions of demons, warriors, and monsters, butchering the very gods who betrayed him - including Aerten, the goddess of fate. Development Bloodforge was developed by Climax Studios who collaborated with Microsoft to work on the game to only be released on Xbox 360 for the Xbox Live Arcade. After the game was completed, Microsoft decided to publish the game themselves and complete it under Microsoft Studios. Bloodforge was released on April 25, 2012 on XBLA. An update on July 27 improved the camera, re-balanced difficulty and corrected issues with awards and achievements not unlocking. Reception Critical reception towards the game was generally unfavourable. Bloodforge received a low rating of only 42/100 at review aggregation website Metacritic.

Founded by lead guitarist Bob Hooker, the band‚Äôs music was influenced by other NWOBHM bands such as Iron Maiden and in particular, Judas Priest. Biography Various early line-ups existed but eventually Hooker recruited John Wiggins on guitar, Dave Orton bass, Rick Bruce drums, and Roger Marsden vocals. This line-up recorded some now much sought-after demo tapes including songs such as \\"Demon Preacher\\", \\"Asylum\\", \\"Witchild\\" and \\"Deep Machine\\". Dave Orton then left and was replaced by Andy Wrighton on bass. Despite developing somewhat of a cult following, and having an impressive reputation for their energetic live performances, Deep Machine were unable to secure a record deal. Eventually Bob Hooker left the band in 1981 and was replaced by Angel Witch guitarist and vocalist Kevin Heybourne. This line-up proved unstable with Heybourne, Marsden and Bruce parting company with the others to form a new line-up of Angel Witc]. Marsden later went on to join the E.F. Band. In 1981, guitarist Tony Harris of the new Deep Machine line-up, joined another band, Destroya, on stage as guest in London's Marquee Club at a one off gig featuring singer Andy Diamond, bassist Brian Genocide, guitarist Terry Lewis and hard hitting drummer Kevin Marx. The band supported Lone Wolf fronted by ex Iron Maiden singer Paul Di'Anno. Deep Machine drummer Steve Kingsley went on to join Rogue Male, and Andy Wrighton teamed up once again with John Wiggins. At this point another NWOBHM band, Gandalf Wizardry, split after two years on the same circuit and Andy Wrighton and John Wiggins approached Wizardry vocalist Andy M F Mawbey in an attempt to revive Deep Machine again, but this lasted only a couple of months until Wiggins announced his departure to join what was later to become Tokyo Blade. Aidan Fitzpatrick (ex Wizardry guitarist) came in for the recently departed Wiggins and auditions began to find a second guitarist to make up a five piece. This phase in Deep Machine history never left the rehearsal studios and finally ended when Andy Wrighton left to join Wiggins in Tokyo Blade. In 2009, Hooker, Wiggins, Marsden and Wrighton decided to play together for the first time in almost 30 years, together with Slam drummer Chas Towler. This eventually gave rise to a new line-up of Deep Machine, including Hooker and Towler with Lenny Baxter (vocals), John Riley (bass) and Nigel Martindale (guitar) which started to gig in 2010. In February 2012, Martindale was officially replaced by guitarist Nick ‚ÄòThe Beast‚Äô East. Deep Machine released their first album Rise of the Machine on 25 April 2014, which was received with overwhelming enthusiasm by Die Hard Machine fans in the UK and Europe. In October 2014, Deep Machine regretfully announced the departure of vocalist Lenny Baxter after four successful years with the band. However, shortly after his departure, Deep Machine announced that Andy M F Mawbey was to replace him as lead vocalist. Mawbey's first live gig with Deep Machine came 32 years after he first auditioned in 1982. John Riley then quit and Chas Towler was let go. The band continued on into 2015, recruiting ex-Kaine members Dan Mailer on bass guitar and Josh Moreton on drums, before officially calling it quits in October that year.

Stanley \\"Sandy\\" Proctor (born December 12, 1939) is an American painter and sculptor in Florida who makes bronze figures. He was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 2006. In 2004 he received the National Sculpture Society's American Artists Professional League Award for a traditional realistic depiction in sculpture. Biography Proctor was born on December 12, 1939 in Tallahassee, Florida. He attended Kate Sullivan Elementary School. Proctor's fifth grade teacher was an inspiration and motivation for his art work. He attended Leon High School in Tallahassee. After graduating from High School he attended Washington and Lee University in Virginia where he earned a bachelor's degree in history and worked three years in Washington, D.C. as a political aide. Proctor then worked in his family's fuel-oil business until 1981, when he then devoted full-time to his art career. Proctor developed a hobby as a painter while a child, which progressed to more advanced paintings as a young man. He loved the outdoors, so he painted subjects like birds, flowers, trees, landscapes and wild animals. Proctor's hobby eventually evolved into a career as people showed interest in his work. His paintings were selected for exhibition in many juried shows by a panel of peers. Among those were displays at the Leigh Yawkey Birds in Art, Southern Watercolor Society Show, and the Florida Watercolor Society Show. Proctor transitioned his art work into sculptures of clay. Later he progressed to working in alabaster and marble. His wife's and family's support helped ease his transition into three dimensional art work. He perfected the use of a Styrofoam armature and became proficient at depicting people and their unique traits, characteristics and personalities. Proctor's work lead to making bronze sculptures portraying moments in life, which he is best known for. His works are displayed at the Smithsonian Museum, the British Museum of Natural History, and the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. In 2004 Proctor's work Seychelles was selected as the American Artists Professional League Award recipient from the National Sculpture Society 71st Annual Awards Exhibition for work best depicting traditional realism. Public sculpture Proctor did a work for the Veteran's Memorial Park in Cupertino, California called The Guardians. One of the first sculptured memorials to those who served in the War in Afghanistan, and the only one directly pertaining to Operation Red Wings. it is a large sculpture of two Navy SEALs killed in the line of duty in Afghanistan in 2005. In November 2007, it was dedicated by Secretary of the Navy Donald Winter. The sculpture depicts Matthew Axelson and James Suh in full combat equipment. The event inspired the war movie Lone Survivor. Proctor offered his opinion to the Tallahassee Democrat that it is \\"my best work yet\\". Because of his scrupulous devotion to realistic depictions of humans, Proctor was the personal choice of Axelson's family for the project, and they made that recommendation to the committee. His work is diverse in subject and location and critically recognized, such as his sculpture titled \\"Sharing Sunshine\\" which is located at the Denver Health Medical Center. Additional sculptures of his are also in collections at the Boyds Collection in Pennsylvania, the Colorado National Jewish Center Hospital; the Living Desert Museum in California; depiction of children playing in the Florida Governor's Mansion Children's Park, cast from a clay work; Hackensack University Medical Center and the Leon County Courthouse. He has done pieces for Bank of America, the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum, the Florida Polk Museum of Art, and the Living Desert Museum in California. The Leigh Yawkey Woodson \\"Wildlife: The Artist's View\\" show and traveling exhibit of 1993 included Proctor's alabaster sculpture of the endangered manatee. A bronze manatee sculpture of his is in the atrium of the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. Proctor's works cost from several thousand dollars for small busts or birds to a $100,000 or more for larger pieces. The Governor of Florida Lawton Chiles presented President Bill Clinton a Proctor work entitled \\"Bandanna\\" in 1995, a work permanently displayed in the White House in the Roosevelt Room. Proctor has made a six- person life-size sculpture for the Florida Sheriff's Fallen Officer Memorial; a six-person Tug-of-War sculpture for Raymond James Financial Art Collection; a five-person sculpture for the University of South Alabama; a three-person sculpture for the Florida State Highway Patrol Memorial; and a two-person sculpture for the Florida Sheriff's Boys Ranch. A sculpture after one of his designs was cast and installed at a library in Clear Lake, Iowa. In about 2004 his Poppies, World War II Veterans Memorial was dedicated in Edmond, Oklahoma. The Tallahassee Democrat newspaper reported in their \\"Life & Arts\\" section of a 2006 Sunday edition that Proctor likely is the most viewed artist in Tallahassee because of the many life-size statues throughout the city. First Lady of the State of Florida commissioned Proctor's sculpture Follow the Leader to be displayed just outside the Florida governor's office window so that all future governors would see children playing, as a reminder that they are the future and the reason for a government. He has nearly a dozen public sculptures on display in and around Tallahassee, and his home town connection is a source of local pride. His citation for inclusion in the Florida Artists Hall of Fame said: \\"The remarkable vision and works of Sandy Proctor demonstrate a powerful lifelong commitment to Florida's rich heritage... Sandy Proctor has devoted his life and work towards creating a more pleasing and inspirational environment for the citizens of Florida.\\" Starting in the twenty-first century he is well known for creating sculptures of famous sports figures a variation of sports iconography including a nine-foot bronze sculpture of Florida State University's head football coach Bobby Bowden that was dedicated at Doak Campbell Stadium in 2004. Proctor also made a life-size statue of baseball player Eddie Stanky. He has also created larger-than-life sculptures of Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks football players Danny Wuerffel, Tim Tebow and Steve Spurrier. After some controversy as to their timing, they were installed and put into place at the University of Florida with a dedication at the Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on April 9, 2011. The commission for the three statues was $550,000. Proctor's sculpture \\"Integration: Books, Bats and Beauty\\" features a group of three nine-foot figures near Florida State University Student Union. It represents the university's first black students that laid a path for integration. In 2009 Pursuitfeaturing three over-sized soccer players that \\"epitomize the Gopher Sport mission statement\\"was dedicated at Owatonna, Minnesota. In 2014, \\"Double the Fun\\" was installed in the Craig R. Rasmussen Outdoor Activity Area of the Ludington Public Library, and the sculptor attended the dedication.
