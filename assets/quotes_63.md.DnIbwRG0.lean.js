Etymology  Linguistic experts disagree about the etymological meaning of the name \\"Schutter\\". The word \\"Schutter\\" is probably derived from the early Germanic form scutro, which means \\"fast flowing water\\". Scutro, which includes the Indo-Germanic root sceud, also allows interpretation in the sense of \\"enclosing\\" or \\"impoundment of water\\" and may refer to the plethora of embankments, dams and mills on the Schutter. In addition to the municipalities of Schuttertal and Schutterwald, Schutterzell, a district of Neuried also bear the name of the river in their place names. The name of the Schutterlindenberg hill in Lahr also comes from the name of the river.  Source, course and tributaries  Source pond of the Schutter The Schutter rises at H√ºnersedel in the Black Forest above Schweighausen at a height of 680 metres, but really begins in the village of Schweighausen at the confluence of two little brooks, the Geisbergbach and the Lohbach. Their source was enclosed in 1904 by the Lahr Branch of the Black Forest Club as called the Schutterquelle. The Schutter initially flows westwards, then, after an almost right-angled bend, northwards through the municipalities of Schuttertal and Seelbach. It then flows increasingly in an arc towards the west again and passes through the borough of Lahr. The Schutter then leaves the Black Forest and flows in a northerly direction parallel to the River Rhine through the Upper Rhine Plain. It crosses the parishes of Friesenheim, Neuried, Schutterwald, Kehl and Willst√§tt and empties into the Kinzig near Kehl, a few kilometres before the Kinzig joines the Rhine. At the end of the last ice age, the W√ºrm Glaciation), the Schutter flowed, like other Black Forest rivers, parallel to the Rhine in the still recognizable Kinzig-Murg Channel. The major tributaries of the Schutter are the Sulzbach and the Unditz.  Use  Passing through 19 towns and villages, the Schutter used to be an important source of energy for commercial traders for centuries. According to the 1925 Baden Hydropower Register (Badische Wasserkraftkataster), no less than 36 hydroelectric power stations operated on the Schutter with a total of 47 waterwheels, 12 electricity generator stations with 17 turbines, including house and farm mills, industrial mills, hammer forges, electricity works, oil mills, barley presses and sawmills. The water of the Schutter was also used to irrigate meadows (water meadows). Today still recognizable meadow-watering systems are found in the parish of Friesenheim-Oberschopfheim, in Hohberg- Niederschopfheim, Kehl-Goldscheuer, Willst√§tt-Eckartsweier (west of the village and in the Schutterwald meadows). So much water was impounded above mills (the Schutterzell mill, Dundenheim mill and Kittersburg mill) or in specially constructed weirs (Eckartsweier), that the surface of the water was higher than the surrounding land and was discharged into irrigation channels. The largest water meadows were the Unterwassermatten (today a nature reserve), which was irrigated for about a hundred years before being abandoned in 1935. In the 2000s, the irrigation of the meadows of Eckartsweier and Kittersburg was put back into operation for ecological reasons. In the Oberschopfheimer Allmend, meadow irrigation was also restarted in 2014.  Flooding and flood protection  The Schutter has flooded time and again, for example in 1958, 1970, 1978, 1980 and 1987, drowning arable land and destroying roads, bridges and houses. The Schutter valley, Lahr and Rhine Plain were equally affected by floods caused by the Schutter. In addition to the many reports of floods in the local town councils minutes, the Flood Cross (Hochwasserkreuz) in Schweighausen recalls a flood in 1895. On 6 June the farmer, Landolin Bauer, was carried away in the floodwaters together with his horse and cart. A cross was erected at the site of the accident above the farm of Stefisbauernhof;; in the Steig, in honor of the victim. In the years 1936 to 1938, the Schutter Relief Canal was built between Lahr-Dinglingen and Nonnenweier in order to protect the villages and towns alongside the Schutter in the Rhine Plain from flood permanently. In addition, two flood retention basins were built at Lahr- Kuhbach (built between 1983 and 1985) and Seelbach-Wittelbach (built between 1989 and 1991). In the 1980s, the relevant municipalities founded the Schutter Mouth Flood Protection Association (Zweckverband Hochwasserschutz Schutterm√ºndung), headquartered in Kehl, to be responsible for flood protection on the lowland section of the Schutter.Zweckverband Hochwasserschutz Between 1994 and 2007, 14 flood protection measures were carried out and some sections of the Schutter were re-naturalised.

It does this by obtaining good quality surplus food from the food industry that would otherwise have gone to waste, and sending it to almost 11,000 charity and community groups across the United Kingdom via the network partners. FareShare only redistributes food inside its use by date; in 2019/20 it obtained and redistributed over 24,000 tonnes of food which would have otherwise gone to waste or landfill. FareShare works with all sectors of the supply chain; producers, manufacturers and retailers. A number of the major UK food retailers have encouraged their suppliers to work with FareShare to minimise food waste. FareShare has also run successful customer food collections with both Sainsbury's and Tesco. In February 2018, the charity announced a three year ¬£20 million partnership with ASDA and The Trussell Trust with the aim of helping more than one million people out of food poverty over the next three years. FareShare redistributed food equivalent more than 57 million meals in 2019/20, reaching charities that serve over 934,000 vulnerable people a week. The food FareShare supplies enables the charity sector to avoid ¬£14 million in like for like food costs per year. This food is delivered to a broad range of frontline charities and community groups across the UK including homeless shelters, day centres, women‚Äôs refuge centres and children's breakfast clubs. During the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown in the UK starting on March 23rd, the FareShare network remained open and operational to continue to get food to vulnerable people. It increased its output from the equivalent of nearly 1 million meals per week to over 3.5 million meals per week. Much of this food was surplus that resulted from the overnight closure of the restaurant, pub, hotel and catering trades. A proportion of the food was donated by UK food retailers Tesco and Co-op, and this donation was matched by the UK government with a ¬£10.5m grant to buy food to redistribute to English charities during lockdown, which FareShare managed. The Scotland government and Welsh Assembly government granted ¬£2.1m and ¬£500,000 respectively to also buy food to redistribute. All of this government grant money went on buying food. thumb FareShare is partnered with Manchester United and England footballer Marcus Rashford. Awards In 2010 the charity won \\"Britain's Most Admired Charity\\" at the Third Sector awards. In 2017 the charity won \\"Charity of the Year\\" at both the Charity Times awards and Third Sector Awards, and was selected for the Telegraph's Christmas Charity Appeal. In 2019 the charity won the Food and Drink Federation's Campaign of the Year award for the Feed People First campaign, which helped to unlock ¬£15m of DEFRA funding to 'level the playing field' for the food industry of the cost to redistribute food to vulnerable people, vs sending it to landfill or anaerobic digestion.

The nearby hamlet of Bu≈Çawa (Buhlau), with a population of 120 inhabitants, is administered jointly with this village. History The village was first established in the Middle Ages. The name of the village was first recorded in 1285 as Villa Scriptoris, Latin for \\"Scribe's village\\". In 1383 its name was recorded by a traveller as Schreibersdorff in German and Pisarcowice in Polish. From 1428 the village belonged to the Cisterian monastery at Leubus. After a period of changing ownership, in 1646 it came under the control of the powerful Oppersdorff family of Oberglogau, who retained ownership of the village until the end of World War II. The parish church of St. Michael, originally known as the Church of St. Nicholas, was first built in the Middle Ages, and first mentioned in 1301. The church was enlarged around 1600, then renovated in 1784, 1858, and 1950. It has Renaissance and Silesian Baroque elements, and was built of brick and stone. The church has many historical objects of worship, including a 16th-century crucifix and a Baroque monstrance of the 17th century. In the church is the 1548 tombstone of local governor, Nicholas Lesoty, a work of Reinaissance design with a bas-relief stone knight. Around the church stretches a medieval stone wall. There is also a large manor house near the village, built in the mid-18th century in the late Baroque style for a local landowning family. It has a very impressive grand staircase and private chapel. It is currently private property. In the Upper Silesia plebiscite of 20 March 1921 419 villagers voted to remain with Germany and 76 voted to join the newly created state of Poland. In the Dobrau Gutsbezirk, the local municipal council, 80 people voted for Germany and six for Poland.Results of the Upper Silesia plebiscite (in German) As a result, Dobrau remained in Germany. In 1933 the village had 628 inhabitants, but by 1939 its population had decreased to 583 people. Before 1945 it belonged to the district of Landkreis Neustadt O.S.

It lies approximately west of Strzeleczki, west of Krapkowice, and south-west of the regional capital Opole. Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see Territorial changes of Poland after World War II). Since 2006 the village, like the entire commune, has been bilingual in German and Polish. The village has a population of 252 inhabitants. The nearby hamlet of Serwitut (Servitut), with a population of 69 people, is administered as part of this village. History Bell tower War memorial The village can trace its history back to 12 November 1663, when a large estate was granted to a nobleman which later became the center of the new town, attracting settlers from nearby villages. The village's name was first recorded as Dziedz√ºtzer Pechh√ºte, indicating it was a hamlet of Dziedzice (as was nearby Servitut). Its name derives from the pitch industry that occupied the villagers. The Polish name, Smolarnia, does not appear before the 19th century, and was first recorded in an official record from 1828. The parish church for Pechh√ºtte and Servitut was in Polnisch Rasselwitz. German documents of the early 19th century do not provide separate census data for Pechh√ºtte and Servitut, but in the 1830s there were counted between Pechh√ºtte, Servitut, and Sedsch√ºtz 44 households with 420 inhabitants. By the 1890s there were 25 families living in the village. However, there was very little arable land, as much of the area was taken up by the forest, an Easement property called the Oberglogauer Servitutwald because it was owned by the wealthy Oppersdorff family from Oberglogau. So, many of the villagers had to work in the forest and on nearby estates. In World War I several soldiers from the village died, but the village itself, like most of Germany, was untouched by physical damage. In 1915, Pechh√ºtte and Servitut had 1111 inhabitants. In the Upper Silesia plebiscite of 20 March 1921 541 villagers voted to remain with Germany and 321 voted to join the newly created state of Poland. As a result, Pechh√ºtte remained in Germany. Before 1945 it belonged to the district of Landkreis Neustadt O.S. Up until 1945 the forest around Pechh√ºtte, by then known as the Sedsch√ºtzer Servitutwald belonged to Count Klaus von Tiele-Winkler of Moschen. During the war, the town suffered minimal damage, with only the school burning down. In 1945 Silesia was given to Poland and the German population of Pechh√ºtte was largely expelled, dramatically reducing the town's population; it has not since reached its former size. The village was renamed Smolarnia and annexed to the newly created Silesian Voivodeship. In 1950 it was reassigned to Opole Voivodeship, and in 1999 reassigned from Prudnik County (formerly Neustadt O.S.) to Krapkowice County.

The village has a population of 1,598. The village has one of the highest concentrations of Germans in Poland, with 18 of 20 seats on the municipal council filled by Germans. History St. John of Nepomuk Church of Saint Nicholas This ancient market town was probably founded in the mid 13th century, around the year 1250; the first documentary mention dates to the year 1327. Its name, first recorded as Strelicz is thought to derive from a Slavic word for \\"archers\\". In 1531 the town's name was recorded in a Latin form as Parva Streletz, and in 1535 as Klein Streletz in German. This was to distinguish it from the nearby town of (Gro√ü) Strehlitz. The town received German town law in 1327; by this point the village was already quite large with a parish church, and since 1375 a school functioned in the village - one of the oldest in Upper Silesia. On March 13, 1428, the village was looted and burned by the Hussites. The city was again destroyed by Swedish forces during the 30 Years War in 1642. In 1742 Klein Strehlitz came under Prussian control. In 1750 the village lost its town rights. When the Archipresbyteriate of Oberglogau was divided, Klein Strehlitz was left with a dean, and until today there is a small deanery in the town. The inhabitants of Klein Strehlitz were always Catholic; in the census of 1861, there were 1370 Catholics, 13 Protestants, and 15 Jews. Before they died out in 1769 the town belonged to the counts of Proskau, passing then to the counts of Schelitz, and then in 1789 to the Prussian state. Until 1945 it belonged to the district of Landkreis Neustadt O.S. In the Upper Silesia plebiscite of 20 March 1921 1381 villagers voted to remain with Germany and 198 voted to join the newly created state of Poland.Results of the Upper Silesia plebiscite (in German) As a result, Klein Strehlitz remained in Germany.

On 17 May 2006 the entire commune of Strzelecki/Klein Strehlitz was declared bilingual in German and Polish, and on 24 November 2008 the old name German name Klein Strehlitz was also made official. The coat of arms of the town most likely comes from the Barons of Promnitz-Pless. The current emblem is based on a drawing made by Heraldic artist Otto Hupp in 1898. The film producer Lothar Stark was born in the village. There is a war memorial in the center of the town that commemorates the soldiers from Klein Strehlitz who died in World Wars I and II.

From 1916 to 1922, Fischer was a student at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt and the Stern Conservatory in Berlin. In 1926, he became a Berlin silent film organist and author of cinema music. He composed a number of piano solos in the then-popular idiom of novelty piano. He also was an arranger for the works of others, such as Carl Robrecht. In the 1930s, Fischer became a popular radio composer, whose concert pieces were played by many light orchestras. He became well-known to radio listeners from the 1930s to 1960s. Although he wrote numerous piano pieces, perhaps his most famous work is the orchestral suite S√ºdlich der Alpen (South of the Alps). He was also well known as the performer on the Grand Odeon organ; he performed under the name of Marcel Palotti between 1930 and 1937.

Headquartered in Beachwood, Ohio, the company develops, markets and sells ETAdirect, a web-based applications solution that provides advanced tools for companies with small, medium and large mobile workforces to automate and optimize planning, scheduling, appointment booking, as well as routing and job allocation and real-time management of any type of field service event. ETAdirect include applications for forecasting, capacity management, routing, real-time field management/dispatch and an advanced HTML 5-based mobility app for field employees. It also includes apps for collaboration, location-based information and customer communications. ETAdirect ETAdirect is powered by a patented algorithm that continuously learns mobile employees‚Äô work patterns, analyzes them statistically and uses pattern recognition to accurately predict an employee's time of arrival at a customer's location and the length that each job/appointment will take, thereby providing enhanced accuracy for planning and customer experience management. ETAdirect typically narrows the wait window to less than 60 minutes. Using time-based predictions, ETAdirect can communicate to consumers the exact time that a field service employee will arrive via voice/IVR, email, text/sms, Twitter and other communications channels, reducing customer frustration, wasted time and inquiry calls to service provider call centers. The software is delivered to businesses over the Internet using a software as a service/eSaaS model. ETAdirect is currently used by seven of the top ten cable television companies in North America, including Cox Communications,http://www.multichannel.com/article/133756-Cox_Tracks_Field_Techs_With_TOA_s_Software.php major broadband operators in Europe, such as Virgin Mediahttp://www.computing.co.uk/computing/news/2261834/virgin-media-woos- customers and ONO (Spain).,http://toatech.com/news/Press_Releases.html?top=9 global communications companies such as Telefonicahttp://www.billingworld.com/news/2013/04/telef-nica-toa- technologies-team-on-field-service.aspx and global utility companies like E.ON.http://www.smartmeters.com/eon-selects-toa-technologies-solution-for- smart-meter-deployment/ Company Information TOA Technologies was founded by Yuval Brisker and Irad Carmi in 2003.

Mohr commenced his formal artistic instruction in 1905 in Koblenz, Germany under the tutelage of German expressionist William Straube (1871‚Äì1954), who was a student of Henri Matisse. His formal training was interrupted by World War I where he served as a Cavalry Officer from 1914 to 1918 in the war's eastern front. The war behind him, in 1919 Mohr studied under expressionist Adolf Holzel (1853‚Äì1934) in Stuttgart and executed his works in the circle of the Rhenish Expressionists in D√ºsseldorf. In 1919, he illustrated a book for famed German expressionist writer Carl Maria Weber and later rendered avant-garde illustrations for other publications. Commencing in 1920 Mohr began a lifelong friendship with the French-German writer Joseph Breitbach (1903‚Äì1980). In 1922, Mohr participated in the First International Art Exhibition in D√ºsseldorf. Later that year Mohr transitioned to Berlin where he became a member of the expressionist November Group and developed an acquaintance with art-handlers Alfred Flechtheim and Wilhelm Uhde. From 1925 to 1931, Mohr both studied and worked in Paris with three one-man exhibitions in 1927, 1929 and 1930. Through his acquaintance with expressionist Max Jacob, Mohr gained access to Pablo Picasso, with further references from his author friend Joseph Breitbach. While in Paris, Mohr was comfortable and frequently seen with the bon vivant literary elite of Paris, including Jean Schlumberger, Andr√© Gide and Julien Green. Many believe that Mohr's finest expressionist paintings were executed during his Paris years and represented bucolic, mythological scenes influenced by the writings of Virgil, Horace and Ovid as the three canonical poets of Latin literature. On occasion during 1925 to 1930 Mohr journeyed to Hungary, Spain, Italy and Switzerland to advance his expressionist agenda. In Rhenish Expressionism1932, Mohr visited Greece where he met and married Elsa Kahn, who would remain his lifelong partner. (Elsa's uncle was investment banker Otto Kahn (1867‚Äì1934) who built a 127-room mansion on Long Island, the second largest private residence in the United States, after George Vanderbilt's Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina.) For the next decade, Mohr worked mostly in Germany, favoring his family homes in Trier and also Merzig, but also with frequent stays in Paris and Greece, inclusive of exhibitions in both Germany and Greece. His last one-man exhibition in Paris was in 1939 as the rumblings of World War II became louder. Mohr recognized the signs of conflict and opted to reside in Greece from 1942 to 1949. From the mid-1930s, Mohr's artistic style migrated from expressionism to a more abstract form of the German expressionist movement, albeit some characterize this period as a transition to cubism by Mohr. While both expressionism and cubism are forms of modern art, cubism is based much less on the expression of emotion than it is on an intellectual experiment with structure and few would argue that emotion is lacking in Mohr's works. His paintings exude expressive emotion and are executed with quintessential German exactitude. Mohr was a wizard in catching an expression as elusive as thought. A master of expressionist painting, Mohr latched on to the brash and angular. We can only imagine Mohr propped on his studio stool, well-groomed yet smug as he lays evanescent highlights onto the implastic background of the canvas of his early expressionistic work and on another occasion wondering if we will identify the blended nuances, all but hidden, in his later abstract expressionist works. From 1950 to 1953, Mohr once again migrated to Paris and worked from a studio provided by the Schlumberger family and remained in close contact with his friend Joseph Breitbach. Beginning in the mid-1950s, Mohr resumed his peripatetic travel rhythm and his lifelong expressionist painting passion became a more casual endeavor. On February 8, 1974, expressionist painter Alexander Mohr died after a short illness in Athens, Greece and was interred there. Several retrospective exhibitions of the work of Alexander Mohr were held in the following decades. His life is described in Alexander Mohr‚ÄìDer Maler mit den Fl√ºgelschuhen a 410-page illustrated monograph written by Christl Lehnert- Leven and published in 1996 in Germany.

History  Protestant church in Pok√≥j Aerial photograph of Pok√≥j in 1930. The Castle is located in the centre of the shot. It was established in 1748 as a hunting lodge by Duke Charles Christian Erdmann, a scion of the House of W√ºrttemberg, whose ancestors had been enfeoffed with the Silesian Duchy of Oels in 1649. The adjacent settlement erected from 1763 with its streets radiating out from the ducal palace was modelled on and named after the Baden residence of Karlsruhe. When the Oels fiefdom fell to the Dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in 1792, Charles Christian Erdmann's cousin Duke Eugen of W√ºrttemberg retained the town and palace of Carlsruhe as a fee tail. In the winter of 1806-07 he hosted the young composer Carl Maria von Weber, who wrote his two symphonies (J√§hns 50/51) here. In 1847 Carlsruhe received the status of a spa town (Bad). In 1871 Carlsruhe together with the Prussian Province of Silesia was incorporated into the German Empire. By the 1945 Potsdam Agreement the area fell to Poland (see Territorial changes of Poland after World War II). At the end of World War II the palace was destroyed in the course of the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive of the Red Army. The Baroque Sophia's Church finished in 1775 is preserved, as is the extended English garden laid out by the W√ºrttemberg dukes. An annual Carl Maria von Weber festival is held to commemorate the composer's stay.

The division continued through the Communist era of 1945‚Äì1990, and the border was not easily crossed until the two countries joined the Schengen Area in 2007.

The title refers to the search for La P√©rouse, who disappeared in the region in 1788, a popular, though unsuccessful, object of the mission. Many of the discoveries made by the scientists attached to the expedition were published in the two volumes. The author, Jacques Labillardi√®re, was a French botanist on the voyage, engaged to collect and describe the flora of the continent. The work includes some of the earliest descriptions of Australian flora and fauna, and an account of the indigenous peoples of Tasmania. The work also contains the second ever description of an Australian spider, the species Trichonephila edulis. Labillardi√®re also describes seeing a dog-sized animal, and discovering the remains of a carnivorous animal, what is considered to be the first European report of a thylacine. The author of the first description, George Harris, cites this work in an 1804 letter regarding rumours of such an animal. Labillardi√®re's work was published in two volumes, becoming very popular and translated into English in the same year; Voyage in search of La P√©rouse (four editions) was issued by John Stockdale with similar success. The contents include his description of the journey, an atlas, and illustrations of ethnographic and natural history subjects. The work is noted for its early botanical illustrations of Redout√©, birds by Jean-Baptiste Audebert, and engravings produced from the surviving illustrations of Piron. The first description of a West Australian eucalypt, Eucalyptus cornuta, and the widely cultivated Eucalyptus globulus are amongst the newly discovered species and genera of flora. Those discovered while anchored at Observatory Island, Esperance Bay, include Banksia nivea, Banksia repens, Anigozanthus rufus and Chorizema ilicifolia. The botanical descriptions were based on the extensive collections made by Labillardi√®re during the expedition's stop at Esperance Bay, and the two visits to Tasmania. The abbreviation Voy.Rech.Perouse is used to refer to this work in botanical literature. The book was published during a time of great interest in the flora of Australia. It was preceded by A specimen of the botany of New Holland (1793‚Äì1795), the first book devoted to the subject. The botanist Robert Brown took a copy of this work on his journey to Australia in 1801, enquiring in his letters home as to whether Labillardi√®re had published his flora. This anticipated work, Labillardi√®re's Novae Hollandiae plantarum specimen (1804‚Äì1806), was published before Brown's more comprehensive Prodromus. This work preceded Rossel's English publication of the d‚ÄôEntrecasteaux journal, Voyage de d‚ÄôEntrecasteaux envoyage √† la recherche de La P√©rouse, by nine years.

It runs from northwestern Tampa to Plant City, and parallels County Road 574 west of Mango. Route description Beginning at the intersection of U.S. Route 92 (US 92 or the Dale Mabry Highway) on the north side of Raymond James Stadium and the site of the former Tampa Stadium as Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard (formerly Buffalo Avenue), SR 574 is a six- lane divided highway until it passes the home office of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and narrows down to a four-lane divided highway. Instantly, the road is surrounded by the Tampa Branch of St. Joseph's Hospital. The road remains a four-lane divided highway until it reaches Armenia Avenue and becomes a four-lane undivided highway with occasional left-turn lanes. The road crosses the Hillsborough River over a high bridge built in 1960. Eastbound SR 574 as it crosses the Hillsborough River over the Paul H. Smith Bridge. The intersection of southbound US 41 Business (US 41 Bus.) moves from Highland Avenue to Tampa Avenue when it crosses SR 574, and the road gets a divider again. Northbound US BUS 41 stays consistently on Florida Avenue. The next two major crossings are a diamond interchange with Interstate 275 (I-275) and then State Road 45 (Nebraska Avenue). East of here, the road consists of residences, local businesses and churches, and most notably the headquarters of radio station WMNF 88.5 FM. The intersection of State Road 585 (22nd Street) includes the Cyrus Green Playground on the southwest corner and College Hill Memorial Park on the southeast corner. A railroad crossing exists between Short 30th Street and 30th Street, and another one two blocks west of US 41 (40th Street). East of US 41, the road narrows down to two lanes, and two blocks later at 42nd Street, the road runs between the Garden of Memories Cemetery and Myrtle Hill Cemetery. The southern boundaries of both cemeteries include East Lake Avenue, since SR 574 crosses that street before the intersection with SR 583 (50th Street). When SR 574 enters Grant Park, it widens back to four lanes in the vicinity of the diamond interchange with Interstate 4, and then widens to six-lanes. East of here, the Florida State Fairgrounds and a gas station can be found on the northwest corner of US 301 in Mango. After this, the road crosses over the Tampa Bypass Canal before reaching a third interchange and narrowing down to four lanes, this time with Interstate 75 as a diamond interchange southbound and a partial cloverleaf interchange northbound. After this, the road widens back to six lanes and encounters its Hillsborough County doppelganger at Broadway Avenue (CR 574) then Lemon Street and Mango Road, one of three disconnected roads in Hillsborough County that have been designated County Road 579. From there, the road narrows back down to two lanes. Before the road intersects Kingsway Road in Seffner, it moves slightly to the northeast, where it runs parallel to Amtrak's Silver Star line, as it also does in Dover. Throughout this section, there are scattered private railroad crossings that intersect with SR 574. In Plant City, SR 574 becomes Sammonds Road, then SR 574 moves onto West Reynolds Street at a sharp reverse curve However neither of these names appear on street-name signs until the route moves off of Sammonds Road. When SR 574 returns eastward it runs along the south side of the ground of the Florida Strawberry Festival. After crossing unmarked State Road 39A, the western truck route for State Road 39, SR 574 intersects with SR 566, which is part of an eastbound only segment of U.S. Route 92. Route 574 joins eastbound US 92 as a shared hidden route with SR 600, all of which enter part of the Downtown Plant City Historic Residential District at Carey Street, and leaves it at Franklin Street. Northbound State Road 39 begins at North Wheeler Street, while entering the Downtown Plant City Commercial District, as Southbound SR 39 joins eastbound US 92/SR 574 just before intersected at North Collins Street and turns south while eastbound US 92/SR 574 becomes East Reynolds Street. SR 574 finally terminates at the intersection of East Reynolds Street, East Baker Street, and North Gordon Street, where the eastbound and westbound(E. Baker St) segments of U.S. Route 92 reunite.

The museum's first director, Alejandro Rosa, had founded the Western Hemisphere Historic and Numismatic Society with Mitre in 1893, and following the classification of Mitre's extensive ethnolinguistic library, numismatic and other collections, the society was located in the museum from 1918 until 1971 (it was rechartered as the National Academy of History of Argentina in 1938). The museum was declared a National Historic Monument on May 21, 1942, and is maintained by the National Secretariat of Culture. The museum can be seen on some Argentine two peso bills.

On 20 August 2010 it was announced that the passenger service would end on 15 December 2010, although the freight-only service resumed shortly thereafter.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-11041554 The service was terminated in 2018 following a fire aboard one of the ships.https://www.scotsman.com/business/rosyth-to-zeebrugge-ferry-service- axed-1-4729040https://www.dfds.com/en-gb/freight-shipping/routes-and- schedules/rosyth-zeebrugge Route The route crossed the North Sea between Rosyth, Fife, Scotland and Zeebrugge, Flanders, Belgium. Near Rosyth, the ferry passes under the Forth Bridge. Superfast Ferries Blue Star 1 under the Forth Bridge in the Firth of Forth, Scotland Blue Star 1 in the port of Zeebrugge, Belgium, June 2007 Following a detailed consultation and tendering process by the Scottish Executive, the Greek shipping company Superfast Ferries (owned by the Attica Group) were confirmed as the operator of the route. Services commenced in May 2002 using two ships - MS Superfast IX and MS Superfast X - to provide an overnight service with a crossing time of 17 hours. Whilst car traffic, particularly in the summer months, proved relatively good, concern mounted that there were insufficient lorries and other freight traffic to make the service viable in the long term. The service was reduced to three times per week in 2005 and Superfast IX transferred to the Baltic Sea. In 2006, the sale of Superfast X was announced and the vessel was replaced with the smaller Blue Star I - of Superfast's sister company Blue Star Ferries (also owned by Attica). In 2008 it was announced that Superfast/Blue Star Ferries would discontinue the service in September. Norfolkline The decision to axe the route caused considerable political disquiet in Scotland. The Scottish Government sought to encourage a new operator to take over the route. In late 2008 Norfolkline announced that it would restart the route in May 2009, again using a thrice-weekly overnight service (but extended to 20 hours, rather than the previous 17 hours, to reduce fuel consumption).http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7789696.stm Like Superfast, the Norfolkline service offered a service for both vehicle and foot passengers.

He attended primary school in rural Furnes, but then moved to the nearby city Hamar to take apprenticeship as a typographer. By 1910 he dwelled as a tenant in √òstregate 55 in the neighborhood √òstbyen, nearby Hamar Station. He recalled having to adapt to the city culture, and shed some of his childhood dialect/sociolect. In 1917 he married taylor's daughter Aslaug Rustad (1892‚Äì1987). She hailed from Hamar and was the oldest girl of ten siblings. After her mother's death when she was fourteen, she had to abandon plans to become a hairdresser to help her father with tending to their family.Larssen, 1969: p. 49 Their daughter Randi (1924‚Äì2002) was a well-known journalist and writer. From April 1946 she was married to Prime Minister of Norway (1971‚Äì72 and 1973‚Äì76) Trygve Bratteli.

He had nearly completed his training when being hired as sub-editor in the Labour Party newspaper Demokraten in June 1913.Note that Egil Helle gives the date wrongly; 1 June 1913. Larssen was hired in mid-June. Hitherto, his experience with journalism had been limited to writing pieces in the youth wing's national newspaper Klassekampen from time to time, a task associated with his active political role. However, he had also involved himself in a debate on the editor of Demokraten, which incidentally was printed by . Larssen had recently become secretary in the board of the newly established county branch of NSU. He was later chosen as one of the secretaries at the NSU national convention in Hamar in 1914.Solbakken 1951: p. 111 On the tenure in Demokraten, Larsen wrote that \\"they were not relieved from the eternal financial torment\\".Larssen, 1969: p. 29 He resigned from the newspaper in 1916.

In 1940, when Norway became invaded and occupied by Germany, Larssen was the acting news editor of Arbeiderbladet before it was stopped by the Germans. He co-edited the illegal Bulletinen from 1940 to 1942, but for this he was imprisoned. He was held at M√∏llergata 19 from January to April 1942, then at Grini until February 1943, and thereafter in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp until the war ended.Giertsen, 1946: p. 102 From this period he wrote the section \\"Blant landsmenn i Sachsenhausen\\" ('Among fellow countrymen in Sachsenhausen') in the memoir book 3 fra Sachsenhausen (together with August Lange, Carl Johan Frederik Jakhelln and W.

In 1998 the Egmont Foundation granted economic support to complete the project. The Egmont Foundation grant (1998‚Äì2003) was primarily aimed at developing a special composed music programme targeted at improving the sound environment in intensive care and recovery wards at a number of hospitals in Denmark. This specially designed music was to be created by composer Niels Eje and according to the grant foundation, implemented and scientifically validated by a group of researchers affiliated to the project. The goal was to actively use specially designed music to improve patient wellbeing and satisfaction during hospitalisation, reduce anxiety and stress, and also improve the patients ability to recover. Since 2001 Musica Humana Research has carried out many activities, including publishing and drawing attention to the research results and how to improve the sound environment for patients in hospitals. The activities includes articles in medical journals, presentations at conferences and symposiums all over the world.

He was born in Vanylven as a son of farmer Knud Larsen Vidnes (1819‚Äì98) og Laurine Knudsdatter (1832‚Äì1910). In May 1929 he married hotelier's daughter Sigrid Birkeland (1900‚Äì1989), who after the death of Vidnes married Arne Ording. He graduated from Volda Teachers' College in 1896, moved to Oslo as subeditor of Arbeideren in 1898 and was hired in the Labour Party main newspaper Social-Demokraten in 1899. In 1900 he was a co-founder and first chairman of Kristiania socialdemokratiske Ungdomslag. He was then one of the founders of Norges Socialdemokratiske Ungdomsforbund in 1903. In 1909 he founded the trade union Norges Socialdemokratiske Presseforening, for all employees in the social democratic press. He was also a board member of the Norwegian Press Association. He had advanced to subeditor, and was from 1912 to 1918 the editor-in-chief of Social-Demokraten. He represented the Labour Party in Kristiania city council from 1914 to 1919, and was a member of its central board from 1912. From 1913 to 1918 he was also a member of the International Socialist Bureau. In 1918 the radical wing of the Labour Party assumed control of the party at the national convention. Vidnes stepped down from the central committee, and from the positions as chairman of Socialdemokratiske Presseforening and chief editor of Social-Demokraten. In a piece called Arbeiderpartiet gaar helt over til bolsjevismen published in the right-wing newspaper Tidens Tegn in May 1919 he denounced the \\"Bolshevism\\" in the Labour Party. In 1919 he was chosen by the Norwegian government as advisor at a League of Nations conference. The next year he was hired as head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs press office. After the German invasion of Norway in 1940, he fled together with the government and royal family to London. Here, he was appointed editor of Norsk Tidend, the organ of the Norwegian cabinet-in-exile. He died in October 1940, after supervising only two issues.

It was founded by the Sisters of Charity (Grey Nuns) of Montreal in 1871, and was the first hospital in Western Canada. The hospital was incorporated in 1960, and as of 2003 has 554 beds and 78 bassinets. St. Boniface Hospital is a tertiary health care facility, employing nearly 3,500 staff and 340 doctors with admitting privileges. The hospital buildings cover about . The St. Boniface Hospital & Research Foundation is the primary fundraising organization for the hospital. The general admissions program cares for 4,000 patients per year in-hospital, and about 40,000 as outpatients. Over 5,000 births per year occur at the hospital. St. Boniface is a regional centre for cardiac care, and is one of two specialized laboratory testing facilities. It also provides diagnostic imaging and hemodialysis for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority. Besides patient care, St. Boniface Hospital also carries out medical research and offers practicum positions for university students through its affiliation with the University of Manitoba. The hospital's primary research mandate is in cardiovascular studies, imaging (especially MRI), neurodegenerative disorders, and nutraceuticals. The hospital also participates in clinical trials of research discoveries. Location St. Boniface Hospital is located near the Red and Assiniboine Rivers in the St. Boniface neighbourhood of Winnipeg, which is home to a large proportion of Manitoba's Francophone population. It lies across the river from downtown and The Forks. The hospital has a parking structure and three parking lots. It also has an ambulance bay.  History  The original hospital building, c. 1871 St. Boniface Hospital was established by the Grey Nuns in 1871, the first hospital west of Quebec. At that time, it was a small facility with four beds. An operating room was added in 1894. The Grey Nuns opened a school of nursing in 1897 and used the hospital to teach patient care. By the early 1900s, the hospital was treating approximately 2,500 patients per year. An isolation hospital and nurse's residence was added in 1900. Due to overcrowding, a new addition was built in 1905, effectively doubling the patient capacity of the hospital. It was awarded provisional approval by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) in 1944, later becoming the office of the Manitoba Chapter of the ACS. As of 2003, the hospital has 554 beds and 78 bassinets. The hospital order was incorporated in 1960 under the name St. Boniface General Hospital, giving it the right to invest and borrow money, own property, and collect fees for services. St. Boniface Hospital, along with the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, opened the first hospice programs in Canada in 1975. The Hospital Research Centre opened in 1987, becoming the first Canadian free-standing medical research facility. During the 1997 Red River flood, the hospital had to be evacuated, and has since created a disaster plan to cope any future evacuations or closures. The Institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at St Boniface Hospital.  Funding  Basic medical care is a benefit provided to all Canadians through Canada's publicly funded health system. However, significant additional funding is required for medical research, improvements in patient services, and the clinical programs found at St. Boniface Hospital. The hospital ended the 2008 fiscal year with a C$900,000 deficit. The St. Boniface Hospital & Research Foundation, founded in 1971, is the primary fundraising organization for St. Boniface Hospital and the Research Centre. By the end of 2006, the Foundation had raised over C$100 million for patient care and research.  Research  The St. Boniface Hospital Research Centre is the hospital's main research facility. It comprises three separate units: the G. Campbell MacLean Building, the Dr. Andrei Sakharov MRI Centre, and the I. H. Asper Clinical Research Institute, which are operated with research grants, industry contracts, fundraising, and funding from the University of Manitoba. The centre opened in 1987. Its primary research mandate addresses three main areas: cardiovascular sciences, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy, and degenerative disorders associated with aging. In addition, the Centre undertakes research in anesthesia, epidemiology, family medicine, infectious diseases, nephrology, nursing, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, sleep disorders, and surgery.  Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences  St. Boniface Hospital's Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences researches heart disease at the cellular and molecular levels. It also hosts the Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology, the journal Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, the International Academy of Cardiovascular Sciences, and its journal Experimental & Clinical Cardiology. The Institute was created as the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences in 1987 by Dr. Naranjan Dhalla. Its researchers have been published in such academic journals as the New England Journal of Medicine and Cardiovascular Research.  Division of Neurodegenerative Disorders  The Division of Neurodegenerative Disorders (DND) was established in 1999. The DND is a neurodegenerative research team working to identify causes and treatments for disorders like Alzheimer‚Äôs, strokes, traumatic brain injury, and central nervous system degeneration, to study the effect of diabetes on neurodegeneration, and to conduct sleep studies. As of 2011, the principal investigators collectively have over 150 journal publications. Canadian Centre for Agri-Food Research in Health and Medicine The Canadian Centre for Agri-food Research in Health and Medicine (CCARM) investigates nutraceuticals and health food in partnership with Agriculture and Agri-food Canada. CCARM‚Äôs mandate is to research natural health products and give the results to the scientific community and the general public. The results of their research have been published in numerous academic journals, including the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition and the Journal of Biological Chemistry.  MRI centre  The Dr. Andrei Sakharov Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Facility, the first of its kind in Manitoba, has three MRI scanners. The facility allows radiologists to diagnose abnormalities of the brain, spinal cord, internal organs and joints. St. Boniface Hospital Research Centre is a recognized leader in the MRI field and has one of the largest MRI research facilities in Canada. An MRI was first installed at St. Boniface in 1990; this MRI was eventually replaced by a more modern version, which is primarily used for clinical purposes. The other two MRIs are research-oriented: they are an interventional scanner and a head-only functional unit. The clinical scanner enables the Centre to do echo-planar imaging, producing images at video rates; the interventional MRI gives physicians access to the patient during imaging, which supports research into robotics-guided laser surgery. Research carried out at the centre has been published in the Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging.  Clinical research  I. H. Asper Clinical Research Institute The I. H. Asper Clinical Research Institute facilitates clinical trials of the discoveries made at the Research Centre. The Institute is the third research facility in Canada to conduct tests on new drugs and medical devices. The I. H. Asper Clinical Research Institute was opened in 2004.  Education  St. Boniface Hospital is affiliated with the University of Manitoba's education and research branches, providing internship and practicum positions for students. The hospital works with multiple University of Manitoba faculties, including medicine, nursing, pharmacy, social work, respiratory therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, as well as with Red River College and Coll√®ge universitaire de Saint- Boniface. St. Boniface Hospital also hosts the Winnipeg Critical Care Nursing Education Program.  Services  St. Boniface is one of Manitoba's two tertiary care centres. Patients are referred to the hospital by their doctors or clinics for specialized care, though most are admitted through the emergency department.Understanding Emergency Department Wait Times: Access to Inpatient Beds and Patient Flow The Medicine Program is the adult general admissions program. This program admits around 4,000 patients per year, and treats around 40,000 through outpatient clinics. Services include: internal medicine, endocrinology, rheumatology, respiratory medicine, gastroenterology, hematology, oncology, pathology and neurology. The outreach program also includes at-home intravenous therapy and nutrition. The hospital has 14 operating rooms; there is also a surgical intensive care unit available for recovery. The surgical department treats over 14,000 patients per year. Emergency Department St. Boniface's emergency department provides acute care for an average of over 100 patients per day, and is the second busiest emergency department in Winnipeg. The emergency room had the third longest wait times in Canada as of 2016. Contributing factors at St Boniface include boarding of admitted patients in the emergency department, no hospital over- capacity protocol, unusually long consultant response times compared to the national average, poor access to around-the-clock diagnostic testing and social services, and having the physically smallest and oldest emergency department in the region.https://www.cihi.ca/sites/default/files/quickstats- static-table_nacrs_2014-15_en_0.xlsxhttp://mchp- appserv.cpe.umanitoba.ca/reference//ER2011_report_Web.pdf Patient visits are expected to rise dramatically in the next few years, as smaller emergency departments in Winnipeg are closed down as part of a region-wide restructuring effort; however there are currently no plans or funding for renovation or expansion.Manitoba government closes three of six emergency rooms in Winnipeg  CTV News St. Boniface Hospital's emergency department made national headlines in March 2017 when wait times to see an emergency physician reached over 18 hours.ER wait-time reaches 18 hours at St. Boniface Hospital  CTV News Family Medicine Program The Family Medicine Program is designed to encourage disease prevention and health maintenance. It also includes a palliative care unit, the first nationally accredited palliative residency program in Canada. The Rehabilitation Program provides inpatient and outpatient physiotherapy. The Mental Health program provides psychological and counselling services to adult and adolescent patients. It also maintains an inpatient program, and provides stress counselling to hospital staff.  Cardiac Sciences Program  The Cardiac Sciences Program (including the departments of Cardiac Surgery, Cardiology, Cardiac Anesthesiology and Critical Care) is an integrated heart health unit designed to treat cardiac problems. The Bergen Cardiac Care Centre provides access to tertiary cardiology care and hosts cardiac operations and diagnostics, the only hospital in Manitoba to offer certain specialized services. It includes three cardiac angiography rooms, one pacemaker and cardiac defibrillator room, one room for procedures in electrophysiology, 17 recovery beds, cardiology clinics, echocardiography rooms, and office space.  Diagnostic imaging  St. Boniface is one of eight hospitals in Winnipeg providing diagnostic imaging services, and is part of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's diagnostic imaging program. It provides: angiography, bone density imaging, CT scans, MRIs, mammography, nuclear medicine tests, ultrasounds and X-rays. St. Boniface was the home of Manitoba's first MRI scanner, and is one of the largest diagnostic MRI facilities in Western Canada.  Laboratories  The laboratories at the St. Boniface Hospital operate under the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's Laboratory Medicine Program; St. Boniface is one of the two main referral sites in the WRHA for specialty tests. They run tests in biochemistry, hematology, immunology, microbiology, cytology and pathology for patients and doctors in Manitoba. They also provide some specialized testing facilities for educational institutions.  Manitoba Renal Program  St. Boniface Hospital provides acute and chronic hemodialysis as part of the Manitoba Renal Program. It also has a renal health clinic to assess patients with kidney problems.  Woman & Child Program  The Woman & Child Program cares for 11,500 patients annually, providing gynecological and obstetrical services, outpatient pediatric care and women's services. Over 5,000 births per year occur at St. Boniface Hospital. The Labour and Delivery department includes services for high-risk deliveries. The family care unit includes fifteen beds for obstetrical patients. The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) cares for 600 premature or ill infants per year; 10% of the births at St. Boniface involve ill or premature babies. Assessment St. Boniface reports 80% patient satisfaction with its services, according to internal inpatient surveys. Mortality rates for inpatients stand at around 2.4%. Unlike the United Kingdom and the United States, Canada does not publish national ratings of individual hospitals. According to internal reviews, the hospital reduced average wait times for acute care surgical patients from 10 hours to 3 between October 2008 and February 2009. As of 2009, the hospital is trying to reduce wait times for emergency room patients. Wait times for scheduled diagnostic services range from 4 weeks for bone density tests to 20 weeks for a myocardial perfusion study. The median wait time for cardiac surgery is 26 days.

It lies approximately south of ChrzƒÖstowice (Chronstau) and east of the regional capital Opole. Since 2006 it has been officially bilingual in German and Polish Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see Territorial changes of Poland after World War II). History The town of Dombrowitz was first mentioned in 1297. In 1526 the area came under the control of the Habsburg Empire. In 1566 the name was recorded as Dumbrowicz. After the War of the Austrian Succession, Silesia was taken by the Kingdom of Prussia. After the unification of Germany, the village was located in the Upper Silesia Province. In the Upper Silesia plebiscite on March 20, 1921, 134 people voted to remain in Germany and 45 to join Poland. Consequently, Dombrowitz remained with Germany. In 1933 Dombrowitz had 233 inhabitants. Until 1945 it was located in the district of Landkreis Oppeln. From 1935 the Nazi government made a large-scale effort to rename places with Slavic-origin names. On 15 June 1936 the town was renamed Eichgrund O.S. In 1939 the town had 294 inhabitants. After 1945 the town was annexed to Poland and much of German population was expelled; it was renamed DƒÖbrowie to de- Germanize it, and later this name was changed to DƒÖbrowice. In 1950 the town was added to Opole Voivodeship and in 1999 Opole County (formerly Kreis Oppeln) was reconstituted. On 20 January 2006 the town was officially made bilingual in German and Polish, and in May its German name was made official alongside the Polish DƒÖbrowice. http://www.chrzastowice.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=107&Itemid;=77 References Category:Villages in Opole County ","title":"DƒÖbrowice, Opole Voivodeship"},{"id":"21523101","text":"Daniec () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina ChrzƒÖstowice, within Opole County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.

The village lies approximately south-east of Dobrze≈Ñ Wielki and north-west of the regional capital Opole. History The settlement of Charnovanz was first mentioned in a 1228 deed issued by the Piast duke Casimir I of Opole, when he relocated a Premonstratensian (Norbertine) nunnery from Rybnik to the site, centered on St Norbert Church. The monastery was vested with extended estates; it was devastated by Swedish troops during the Thirty Years' War in 1643 and the nuns fled to Boleslawiec in Greater Poland. After the war, the monastery was rebuilt in a Baroque style finished in 1682. St Anne Church From 1684 to 1688, a Baroque wooden church was erected south of the village at the site of a medieval chapel dedicated to Saint Anne. On 19 August 2005 the building burnt down completely, presumably by an arson attack, but has since been restored in its original condition. The monastery's estates were finally secularised by order of the Prussian government in 1810. The present-day convent was re-established in 1870 by the Breslau bishop Heinrich F√∂rster with the consent of Pope Pius IX. Part of the German Empire since 1871, the village remained with Germany upon the Upper Silesia plebiscite of 1921; it was renamed Klosterbr√ºck by the Nazi authorities in 1936. After World War II, the area became part of the re- established Republic of Poland (see Territorial changes of Poland after World War II).

It is the seat of the Gmina Dobrze≈Ñ Wielki (administrative district) and is situated in the central district of the Opole Voivodeship, lying approximately north-west of the regional capital Opole. It is bordered by the Popiel√≥w municipality to the west; the Pok√≥j municipality to the north, the Mur√≥w and ≈Åubniany districts to the east, in addition to Opole city and the DƒÖbrowa and Lewin Brzeskimunicipalities to the south. Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (see Territorial changes of Poland after World War II). The village has a population of 4,500. Geography The climate is characteristical for that of the country, with a temperature variation slightly below average. January sees temperatures between -1 and 9 degrees Celsius, in comparison to an average of 17.8 in July. The Odra River flows from the southeast to the northwest of the district, and is the area's main watercourse. This stretch is navigable and is frequently used for water transport. The river's water levels reach their highest state from February - March and July - August, whereas they are lowest from September - October. Several other waterways, such as the Mala Panew, ≈ªyd√≥wka, Brynica, Jemielnica, Swornica, and Brzeziczanka form a vast river network in the area, in addition to numerous streams. Several ponds, oxbow lakes, and a network of canals and drainage ditches are also situated in the town's vicinity. The Brynica and Odra rivers are characterized by relatively flat surrounds, thus the Dobrzen Wielki area is susceptible to flooding. One of the town's most catastrophic floods occurred in 1997, when water submerged land on both sides of the Odra river. History The town's first written mentions of the town, cited as Dobren, can be derived from a document dated 1228, concerning the transfer of the Norbertine Monastery from Rybnik to the nearby village of CzarnowƒÖs. A later document, however, dated 1279, provides the name of the town as Dobrze≈Ñ,Gmina tu siƒô nazywa Dobrze≈Ñ. and mentions that it is part of the province of Dobrze≈Ñ. The village itself was under the possession of Kazimierz, Duke of Opole, and in 1279, was granted Magdeburg rights. In 1658, the Church of St. Roch (Kosciol Sw. Rocha) was constructed, following the invasion of the Norbertine monastery by Protestant armies in 1643.

Founded in 1837 by James Stokes as the Albion Brewery, it was located beside the Swan River on a block bounded by Mounts Bay Road, Spring Street and Mount Street. The business changed hands -- and names -- several times, until its ultimate acquisition by competitor the Swan Brewery in 1927. Emu Brewery New brewery buildings were constructed over the years. The most notable of these was an imposing Art Deco building erected between 1936 and 1938. This building continued to be used to produce Emu-brand beer until the late 1970s, when production was shifted to a new factory in Canning Vale. Emu beer continues to be produced as a brand of Swan Brewery owner Lion Nathan.  Albion Brewery: 1837-1848  In the early 1830s, the Swan River Colony was in its infancy and did not have a substantial local beer industry.Spiller, p. 17 Preachers from the Temperance League lobbied against the drunkenness prevalent in the Colony, however the lack of locally produced beer meant that they focused their attention on spirits drinkers.Spiller, p. 18 Governor James Stirling believed that the construction of a local brewery may reduce the Colony's drunkenness problems by allowing the men to drink beer instead of spirits. Scotsman James Stokes had arrived in Western Australia in 1834 at the age of 24. He saw the opportunity in the market for a brewery, and investigated potential sites. Surveyor-General John Septimus Roe had set aside a small triangular lot for use as a brewery; this block was bounded by Spring Street, Mount Street and St Georges Terrace. Stokes preferred the much larger block across Spring Street, which extended almost all the way to the riverfront. The site was more suitable because it featured a natural spring, there was a sufficient different in elevation to enable the use of gravity in the brewing process without the need for a large tower. The proximity to the river also made river transport an attractive option. Stokes bought this land from George Leake, and was operating his brewery by 1837.Spiller, p. 19 Although the brewery was named the Albion Brewery after the ancient name for Great Britain, it was more popularly known as Stokes' Brewery. It was the colony's first major stand-alone brewery. At the time, darker beer varieties were popular in Britain, however Stokes believed that the pale ales that were being exported to India would become popular locally. Contrary to what Governor Stirling had hoped, Stokes began distilling spirits at the brewery in 1838. In 1839 Stokes mortgaged the brewery site back to the original owner, Leake, to fund the purchase of the adjacent block.Spiller, p. 20 There, he built himself a house; around this time he also bought the small portion of river frontage immediately in front of the brewery from the government for ¬£13/5s/-. In the same year, Stokes also formed a partnership in land and commission agents with Dubois Aggett, however in 1840 Aggett maimed himself while attempting suicide, and Stokes severed the partnership.Spiller, p. 21 1840 also saw the market for Albion Brewery's beer fall away due to a sluggish economy. It did not escape Stokes' attention that duties were levied on imported spirits, but not on those produced locally. Seizing upon the business opportunity, he imported a large still and expanded the brewery's distillery. The Government responded to this by imposing a tax on locally produced spirits as well, leading Stokes to stop Albion's distilling efforts.  Stanley Brewery: 1848-1908  Eventually the market situation improved for Stokes to the point that in 1848 he opened a new brewery on the site to replace the old Albion Brewery. The Stanley Brewery opened on 1 November 1848, selling what it described as a \\"nutritious body ale superior to any imported\\", costing ¬£4/- per hogshead.Spiller, p. 27 Along with other local businessmen, Stokes successfully lobbied for the transportation of convicts to Western Australia to help alleviate the chronic labour shortage.Spiller, p. 29 It has also been speculated that he saw it as a potential new market for his beers, believing that the convicts would have less discerning tastes. Stokes returned to England in 1857, where he married his cousin Julia.Spiller, pp. 29-30 He returned to the Swan River Colony with his pregnant wife, however she died after giving birth.Spiller, pp. 30-31 Stokes quickly lost his interest in brewing and died in 1861. The brewery continued to be operated by Henry Saw and William Meloy, who had worked in the business for many years and to whom Stokes had bequeathed interests in the business.Spiller, p. 31 Saw died in November 1870, and since Meloy did not want to remain in the operation, the lease over the brewery was advertised. John Maxwell Ferguson took over the lease, and in 1872 recruited the German expatriate brewer William Mumme.Spiller, p. 32 Over the following decades, the business changed hands several times.Spiller, pp. 33-34 In January 1875 the brewery was advertised for rent with the previous operators being J M Ferguson and William Mumme. In May 1875 George Hamersley applied for a licence to operate the Stanley Brewery and buy September 1875 it had been re-equipped and was open for business. The licence was then held by brothers George and Hugh Hamersley. On 1/4/1876 he formed a partnership to operate the brewery with his brother Hugh and D W Harwood who was a brewer. In November 1876 it was advertised that the licence was to be transferred from G & H Hamersley to the new partnership. In November 1877 it was advertised that the licence was to be transferred from G & H Hamersley to D W Harwood. In March 1882 the licence was transferred to John Jones and Robert Hall. In May 1882 there was a Supreme court case between Sir John Forrest who was the husband of George and Hugh's sister and D W Harwood concerning a breach of contract in the amount of 160 pounds relating to the lease of the Stanley Brewery which had expired in February 1882. In 1887, a new brewery building was constructed on the site. The brick structure was imposing, featuring blind brick arches, and was topped with a Mansard-roofed tower containing a tank. The brewery in the 1900s After the successful initial public offering of the rival Swan Brewery, the Stanley Brewery felt the pressure to follow the same path.Spiller, p. 75 In 1905 the business re-formed as the Stanley Co-operative Brewery Ltd, and had former politician Michael O'Connor as chairman of its board of directors. This new company was majority- owned by the Stanley Brewery Co Limited.Spiller, p. 77  Emu Brewery: 1908 onwards  The Stanley Brewery's most popular brand of beer was an ale sold under the \\"Emu\\" trademark.Spiller, p. 76 In order to ensure that drinkers knew from which brewery the Emu brand came, as well as to avoid confusion between the Stanley Co-operative Brewery Limited and its similarly named holding company, the company was renamed on 6 March 1908 to the Emu Co-operative Brewery Ltd. The Emu Brewery had been turning out beer of variable quality, and only managed a quarter of the output of the Swan Brewery.Spiller, p. 78 However, the recruitment of Ernest Terry in 1909 led to a turnaround in the fortunes of the newly renamed Emu Brewery Ltd. The brewery became profitable once more, and even won awards for its beers at the Royal Agricultural Show, which dismayed the traditional award winner, Swan. Emu continued to compete with Swan by introducing Emu Bitter, a bottom-fermentation beer to compete with the bitter beer Swan introduced in 1923.Spiller, p. 80  Acquisition by Swan Brewery and subsequent history  On 3 February 1927, the brewery's directors approached the Swan Brewery to sell Emu's assets.Spiller, p. 81 Swan proceeded with this acquisition of the Emu Brewery, and continued to operate it as a separate business from Swan's own operations.Spiller, p. 82 Arthur Jacoby was appointed as the general manager of both breweries. During the 1930s, a significant amount of land was reclaimed from the river, and the brewery lost its river frontage. Also, between 1936 and 1938, a new brewery building designed by Perth architectural firm Oldham, Boas and Ednie-Brown was constructed on the site. Constructed in the Art Deco style, this new building replaced the old Stanley Brewery building. An aerial view of the new complex in 1938 The building was built from reinforced concrete and steel, and was visibly divided into two halves: one with windows to allow in a maximum of daylight, and the other with no windows at all, to exclude daylight. A central tower housing a lift and staircases delineated the two areas. A border frieze at the top of three of the building's sides depicting different stages in the brewing process was designed by John Oldham and executed by sculptor Edward F. Kohler. An image of the 1938 building featured on Emu beer labels for over fifty years. The Emu Brewery continued manufacturing on the site until the late 1970s, when production of both the Swan and Emu brands was shifted to a factory in Canning Vale. After this, the Emu Brewery building was left derelict. In 1991, the Emu Brewery was the \\"last major industrial structure\\" in Perth's central business district. Despite having been placed on the Register of the National Estate, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. The Art Deco Society of Western AustraliaThe official website of the Art Deco Society of WA includes an architect's perspective drawing (thumbnail) of the Emu Brewery on its home page. was set up in 1987 to lobby for the protection of Perth's art deco heritage, including the Emu Brewery. After heritage minister Jim McGinty refused to place the building on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places, the building was demolished in late 1991. Subsequent plans to build high-rise offices or apartments on the site consistently fell through for almost a quarter of a century, leading to the site being labelled \\"seemingly jinxed\\". Eventually, in 2017 the first of three towers planned as part of a development called Mia Yellagonga was completed. Called Karlak, this tower has 32 levels and is the new headquarters for Woodside.
