In a career which lasted from August 1994 until September 1997, he ran sixteen times and won six races. He recorded his most important success when winning the Classic St. Leger Stakes as a three-year-old in 1995, the same year in which he won the Dante Stakes. In the following season he became the first Classic winner in fifty years to win the Ascot Gold Cup. Background Classic Cliche is a bay horse with a white star sired by the Prix de la For√™t winner Salse, whose progeny also included the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes winner Air Express and the Turf Classic Invitational Stakes winner Timboroa. Classic Cliche's dam Pato also produced the Yorkshire Oaks winner My Emma and was a member of the same Thoroughbred family which produced The Derby winners Blakeney and Morston. Classic Cliche was consigned by the Nidd Park Stud to the Tattersalls sales as a foal in November 1992 where he was sold for 13,500 guineas by N. Magill. In October 1993 the yearling was sent to the Goffs sales in Ireland and was bought for IR¬£85,000 by the Malaysian businessman Ivan Allan. Allan sent the colt into training with Henry Cecil at Warren Place stables at Newmarket. Racing career =1994: two-year-old season= Classic Cliche made his racecourse debut in a seven furlong maiden race at Newmarket on 26 August. Ridden by Pat Eddery he started 6/5 favourite and \\"held on well\\" in the closing stages to win by a head from Okavango. A month later, he started favourite for a minor stakes race at Ascot in which he was beaten a short head by Wijara, with the future multiple Group One winner Luso finishing fourth. At the end of the year, Classic Cliche was sold to Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation and transferred to the stable of Saeed bin Suroor. =1995: three-year-old season= Classic Cliche made his first appearance for Godolphin in the Dante Stakes at York, a recognised trial for The Derby. Ridden by Walter Swinburnhe took the lead two furlongs from the finish and stayed on gamely in the straight to win by half a length from Annus Mirabilis, with the favourite Presenting four lengths back in third. Classic Cliche ran next in the Prix du Jockey Club at Chantilly on 4 June. He stayed on in the closing stages to finish fourth behind Celtic Swing, Poliglote and Winged Love. Six days later Presenting was beaten less than two lengths by Lammtarra in the Epsom Derby. On 2 July Classic Cliche finished fifth behind Winged Love in the Irish Derby. After a break of two months, Classic Cliche reappeared in the St. Leger at Doncaster for which he started 100/30 favourite. Dettori tracked the leader, Jural, before moving into the lead four furlongs from the finish. Classic Cliche quickly went clear of the field and won by three and a half lengths from Minds Music. The win gave Dettori the 1,000th win of his career. =1996: four-year-old season= As a four-year- old, Classic Cliche was campaigned over extended distances. On his seasonal debut, he was pitted against the Irish St. Leger winner Strategic Choice and the Gran Premio del Jockey Club winner Court of Honour in the Yorkshire Cup at York. Ridden by Mick Kinane, Classic Cliche took the lead in the straight and stayed on strongly to beat Strategic Choice by one and a half lengths. Classic Cliche was then moved up in distance and class to contest the two and a half mile Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in June, a race which no Classic winner had won since Ocean Swell in 1945. The Godolphin colt started 3/1 second choice in the betting behind the 1/2 favourite Double Trigger. Mick Kinane restrained Classic Cliche for much of the race before moving him up to challenge in the straight. Classic Cliche took the lead in the closing stages and was driven out by Kinane to win from Double Trigger and Nononito. A month later, Classic Cliche returned to Ascot for Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles. He was always prominent and took the lead in the straight but was overtaken by Pentire and finished second, beaten one and three quarter lengths, a neck ahead of the Derby winner Shaamit. On his final appearance of the year, Classic Cliche was sent to Longchamp for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He made little impression, and was eased down by Frankie Dettori in the straight, finishing fifteenth of the sixteen runners behind Helissio. =1997: five- year-old season= On his five-year-old debut, Classic Cliche attempted to win the Yorkshire Cup for the second successive year, but ran unaccountably badly, finishing last of the nine runners behind Celeric. In the Ascot Gold Cup, Classic Cliche faced an exceptionally strong field which included Celeric, Double Trigger, Nononito, Moonax and Persian Punch. Ridden by Dettori, he was held up in the closing stages before moving up to take the lead in the straight. Inside the final furlong he was overtaken by Celeric and finished second, beaten three quarters of a length. In July, Classic Cliche started favourite for the Goodwood Cup, but was beaten one and a half lengths by Double Trigger. On 24 August, Classic Cliche was sent to France to contest the Prix Kergorlay at Deauville, in which he was ridden by John Reid. Starting the 7/10 favourite, he took the lead in the straight and won by two lengths from Orchestra Stall. Classic Cliche's final race was the Irish St. Leger at the Curragh in September. He started 2/1 joint favourite but was never a threat and finished tailed-off last of the seven runners behind Oscar Schindler. Stud career Classic Cliche stood at the Wood Farm stud in Shropshire before moving to the Kilbarry Lodge Stud in Ireland. His best flat racing performer was the filly Macadamia who won the Falmouth Stakes in 2003 He is currently marketed as a National Hunt sire.

It is implemented analogously to a \\"tournament\\" between elements to determine the \\"winner\\" (maximum or minimum element), with the certificates enforcing the winner of each \\"match\\" in the tournament. It supports the usual priority queue operations - insert, delete and find-max. They are often used as components of other kinetic data structures, such as kinetic closest pair.  Implementation  A kinetic tournament is organized in a binary tree-like structure, where the leaves contain the elements, and each internal node contains the larger (or smaller) of the elements in its child nodes. Thus, the root of the tree contains the maximum (or minimum) element at a given time. The validity of the structure is enforced by creating a certificate at each node, which asserts that the element in the node is the larger of the two children. When this certificate fails, the element at the node is changed (to be the element in the other child), and a new certificate representing the new invariant is created. If the element this node was a winner at its parent node, then the element and certificates at the parent must be recursively updated too.  Analysis  This is a O(n) space, responsive, local, compact and efficient data-structure. *Responsiveness: A certificate failure will cause the creation of a new certificate to replace the old one, which must be put into the event queue. It may also trigger changes to the O(logn) certificates at its parent nodes. Each certificate change requires a delete and insert operation in the priority queue of events. Each of these takes O(log n) time, so the responsiveness, the total time required to process an certificate failure, is O(\\\\lg^2 n). While this is considered responsive in general, it is less responsive than other kinetic priority queues such as kinetic heaps which respond to certificate failures with O(1) certificate changes. *Locality: Each element is involved in O(logn) certificates (for example, the maximal element is involved in a certificate at each of its parents all the way up to the root node). Again, while this is considered local, a kinetic heap is much more local. *Compactness: This is a very compact structure, containing O(n) certificates - exactly one for every edge in the tree. *Efficiency: Kinetic heaps are very efficient, with the number of internal events (certificate changes) being only a factor of O(log n) more than the number of external events. Specifically, for a collection of space-time trajectories where each pair intersects at most times, the kinetic tournament processes events in time, where is a Davenport-Schinzel sequence. Additionally, insertions and deletions cause O(logn) certificate changes each. Each certificate change takes O(logn) time, which is determined by the time required to execute the event queue update.

It is one of five large-scale studio interior paintings in a series. The series is either referred to as the Artist's Studio series or more colloquially as the Studios and sometimes is described as excluding the other 1973 painting, reducing the series to four. The series refers to a set of works by Henri Matisse, with this work specifically referring to L'Atelier Rouge. The work incorporates several other Lichtenstein works and gets its name from the large portion of Lichtenstein's Look Mickey that is included. Lichtenstein used a much more realistic representation of his own works than is standard for most artists. Elements of the work also refer to works from both Fernand L√©ger and Matisse. Background Artist's Studio‚ÄîLook Mickey was inspired by Henri Matisse's L'Atelier Rouge, 1911. Lichtenstein's studios reference what are known as Matisse's four Symphonic Interiors of 1911 (The Pink Studio, The Painter's Family, Interior with Eggplants, The Red Studio) and an earlier Matisse The Dance. Artist's Studio‚ÄîLook Mickey was part of a series that included The Artist's Studio - with Model, 1974, Artist's Studio, Foot Medication, 1974, Artist's Studio, the \\"Dance\\", 1974, Artist's Studio/A Still Life, 1973. Artist's Studio‚ÄîLook Mickey was the only one of the five to include a corner of the room, like The Red Studio. Many sources, including Lichtenstein himself only include four works in the series (excluding Artist's Studio/A Still Life, 1973). In a 1995 lecture in conjunction with the Kyoto Prize, he said \\"I did a series of four large, about 8' x10', paintings of interiors of artists' studios. They were inspired by Matisse's paintings...\\" Artist's Studio‚ÄîLook Mickey is regarded as the first of the four Artist's Studio works. From among the Artist's Studio series works, this depicts \\"the deepest, most plainly articulated interior space.\\"Rondeau and Wagstaff. p. 73. Description The work, which is in part a retrospective, \\"conflated early modernism with emergent postmodernism\\".Rondeau and Wagstaff. p. 50. Lichtenstein refers to some of his paintings, including Look Mickey in this work, which depicts his own studio as the ideal studio and implies that the public consensus ratifies his choice of popular culture subject matter. The series depicts individual Lichtenstein works as well as groups of works in closed room that is devoid of paint brushes or easels. The series served as a review of Lichtenstein's post 1961 work, with objects of his prior works decorating the room as furnishings. In Artist's Studio‚ÄîLook Mickey, the couch, door, wall frieze, telephone and fruit all are drawn from earlier works and serve this setting as interior decoration, while Look Mickey is almost presented undisturbed in its entirety. Less notable works include the mirror and the Trompe-l'≈ìil painting of the rear side of the canvas. Two other paintings were works in progress at the time of this work and one became a painting within a year after the completion of this work: the gull and the dune landscape. The speech balloon was never produced as a separate work. However, its juxtaposition to the speech balloon from Donald Duck is intriguing.Rondeau and Wagstaff. p. 76. He references his Entablatures works as ceiling molding. Lichtenstein's approach to presenting his own works within his works was non-traditional. The works were revisited as exact duplicates rather than the more standard distanced revisitation. This choice of exact duplication contrary to popular practice intrigued Lichtenstein. Lichtenstein liked this quality of his paintings within his paintings, saying \\"I like the combination of a very separate quality that each of my paintings has within the painting, and the fact that everything works as one painting too.\\" In fact, Lichtenstein commented on this as an attempt to eliminate any modulation: The Studio series was inspired by Matisse paintings, and Diane Waldman claims that this particular effort was modelled upon Matisse's L'Atelier Rouge (The Red Studio), although the Lichtenstein Foundation website credits two other Matisse works as inspiration as well as Fernand L√©ger's The Baluster, 1925, which is represented in the far right corner. L√©ger was one of Lichtenstein's closest friends. By incorporating Matisse in his own studio setting, Lichtenstein is perceived as presenting himself as Matisse's peer and in so doing repositions pop art as a historical style rather than a contemporary one. A sketch for this work demonstrates Lichtenstein's original intent to incorporate a \\"plant-in-vessel arrangement\\" as well as fruit on the table, but these Matisse references were instead depicted on the floor of the studio.Rondeau and Wagstaff. pp. 73-4. The table instead includes the telephone from Lichtenstein's own R-R-R-R-Ring!! with differences from the original that amount to puns. In the original, Lichtenstein depicted sound with motion lines that present a pronounced movement of the object. This contrasts with the same phone in the studio setting in \\"perfect stasis\\", which contributes to the pacific still life setting. Reception According to Janis Hendrickson, \\"For someone familiar with the artist's oeuvre, the Studios could become mental playgrounds.\\" Waldman notes that \\"Perhaps the most significant aspect of the work is its retrospective nature and the decision by the artist to reflect on his life, past and present.\\" The small portion of the original that was cropped out was the majority of Mickey Mouse, emphasizing Donald Duck, who Graham Bader sees as Lichtenstein's metaphorical representation.

First proposed in 1965 the idea gained interest since the early 2000s. Spectral radiance The usefulness of an x-ray beam for scientific experiments depends upon the beam's spectral radiance, which tells how much power of a given wavelength is concentrated on a spot. Most scientific literature on x-ray sources uses a closely related term called brilliance, which counts the rate of photons produced, rather than their power. The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to the photon's wavelength. Very high power is usually achieved by delivering the energy in short pulses, allowing the apparatus to work within reasonable power demands and cooling limits. Depending upon the pulse length and repetition rate, the average spectral radiance will be much lower than the peak spectral radiance. The peak spectral radiance and the average spectral radiance are both important properties of an x-ray beam. For some experiments, the peak value is most important, but for other experiments, the average value is most important. As a synchrotron light source, the performance of an energy recovery linac falls between a storage ring and a free-electron laser (FEL). Energy recovery linacs have high repetition rates and therefore high average spectral radiance, but lower peak spectral radiance than a FEL. Mechanism While using a recirculating charged particle beam with a magnet lattice resembling that of a storage ring, each particle travels through the recirculating arc before being decelerated in a linac structure. The same linac structure also accelerates new low-energy particles that are continuously injected into the linac. Thus, instead of recycling the particle beam continuously, while its emittance increases by synchrotron radiation emission, only its kinetic energy is recycled, enabling a low beam emittance while maintaining high repetition rates comparable to synchrotrons. #Charged particles (usually electrons) are injected into a linear accelerator (linac), where the particles are accelerated by a radio frequency (RF) field. #The beam of accelerated particles exits the linac, and passes through a series of magnets, that guides the beam back to the beginning of the linac. #The length of the beam path is such that the returning particles are about 180 degrees out of phase with particles being accelerated by the linac. #The phase difference causes the returning particles to be decelerated, while newly injected particles are accelerated. The kinetic energy of the decelerated particles increases the intensity of the RF field, which is used by the particles being accelerated.  Energy Recovery Linacs around the world  = Brookhaven National Laboratory = BNL-ERL is aimed at 500mA at 20MeV. It is now under commissioning at the Collider Accelerator Department at Brookhaven National Laboratory. One of the main feature of this ERL is a superconducting laser photocathode RF gun powered by a 1MW CW klystron and equipped with a load-lock system for the insertion of high quantum efficiency photocathodes. This ERF gun will provide high brightness electron beams at an unprecedented average power. The objective of this ERL is to serve as a platform for R&D; INTO HIGH CURRENT ERL. In particular issues of halo generation and control, Higher-order moder issues, coherent emissions for the beam and high brightness, high power beam generation and preservation. Following its completion we plan to use it for various applications, such as the generation of THz radiation and high power x rays through compton scattering of laser light off its electron beam. = Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory = = Cornell University = Cornell University, in partnership with Brookhaven National Laboratory, are in the process of constructing CBETA,G.

In an article about the origin of McDonald's golden arches, architectural historian Alan Hess wrote: \\"Nationwide success and proliferation have obscured the origins and creators of [the arches] in Southern California. Its architect, Stanley Clark Meston, has virtually never been credited with his contribution to American architecture.\\" Born in Oxnard, California, in 1910, Meston attended Los Angeles Polytechnic High School, taking basic courses in drafting and architectural history. After graduation, he apprenticed in architects' offices before becoming a licensed architect; while working in Earl Heitschmidt's office, Meston worked on the 1937 CBS building in Hollywood by Heitschmidt and William Lescaze. As did several more prominent Los Angeles architects during the Great Depression, he also worked for a time as a set designer, at Universal Pictures. Opening his own Fontana office, which ranged from two to eight employees, Meston's practice was primarily civic, including city office buildings, schools, and county facilities. Meston's experience during the 1930s had prepared him to design the building that was to become a major influence on the car-culture architecture of the 1950s. He had worked for Wayne McAllister, a Los Angeles restaurant and drive- in architect responsible for many of the trend-setting Streamline Moderne drive-ins of the decade, including Simon's, Herbert's, Robert's, and Van de Kamp's. \\"Nothing in the East compares with the best things of this sort in Los Angeles,\\" wrote Henry-Russell Hitchcock in 1940, praising in particular McAllister's Van de Kamp's design. Meston, having worked on several of these designs, was in an excellent position to reinterpret their car-oriented tradition for the generation and technology of the 1950s. When the McDonald brothers hired Meston, they offered him a choice of being paid a flat fee or a commission each time a new restaurant was built. He chose the fee. Meston's work has appeared in 28 countries and most of the world's principal cities, including Hong Kong, Tokyo, London, and Mexico City. In southern California and its vicinity, projects of his include the Verde Professional Building in Victorville, California; the San Bernardino County West End Courts Building; Wilbur Clark's Desert Inn in Las Vegas; and high schools in Visalia, Los Angeles, Gardena, Inglewood, Glendora, Palmdale, and several other southern California cities.

It has been operating since 2007 and contains several petabytes of recordings and subtitle data. It is notable for being the proof of concept for the Flash video streaming version of the BBC iPlayer. It is an internal research project developed for testing which acts as a giant video on demand or personal video recorder (PVR). It contains a complete digital archive, recording both television and radio twenty-four hours a day, of all of the BBC's national and also some regional broadcast output since mid-2007, and is automatically compiled without human input. The BBC stated that BBC Redux is one of its major contributions to the field of digital archiving and preservation. Some accounts for accessing the system on a temporary basis were made available at Mashed 08 and again at Culture Hack Day 2011, providing streaming-only access to BBC content broadcast during the weekend of the event. As well as streaming, the system enables high-quality downloads of television and radio content, and has had the option to download subtitles from programmes since 2008. BBC Redux had originally been developed at the BBC's Kingswood Warren campus, in only two months, and with the investment required being significantly less than the iPlayer. The saved content can be used for broadcast compliance checking and by BBC programme researchers. , BBC Redux is only available to employees, because existing legal contracts with content producers limit how material can be broadcast, distributed and made available to general consumers. The Readme file for associated API frameworks hosted on GitHub states: Technical details The system records over 100 megabits per second, continuously. , BBC Redux contained 300,000 hours of recorded audio and video. Not all regional variations are recorded; for BBC One, only London and Northern Ireland variants are recorded. A series of standard Digital Video Broadcasting terrestrial antennas and satellite dishes, coupled to DVB-T and DVB-S TV tuner cards are used to capture the incoming DVB multiplexes transmitted for over- the-air Freesat and Freeview terrestrial television. These raw MPEG transport streams are split into single-programme MPEG transport streams, encapsulated in RTP, and sent using UDP IP multicast within the IPv4 multicast address range \`233.122.227.0/24\` from \`AS31459\`. From the multicast streams individual television programmes can be extracted and saved, without requiring any transcoding or conversion of the contained MPEG-2 video data. , racks of Sun Fire T1000 and T2000 machines were used acquiring and storing the incoming programmes respectively; while commodity x86-64 computers were used for database operations and playback transcoding. The T2000 storage nodes are connected by 10 Gigabit Ethernet on the network side, and then by serial attached SCSI to RAID boxes containing high-capacity commodity Serial ATA hard disk drives. The \\"fsck-free\\" ZFS file system is used after experiments with Unix File System (UFS) proved it to be too slow. Sun Microsystems had to manually repair the filesystems on two occasions using Unix \`dd\`. The software is based on open source technologies,; and uses a combination of \`mod_perl\` and C running on OpenSolaris. A series of \\"lolcat\\" images are used for the system's HTTP 404 and error pages. Projects As part of the European Union (EU) \\"NoTube\\" project running between 2009‚Äì12, a recommendation research system using Lonclass categorisation and Tanimoto coefficient matching was tested by the BBC R&D; Audience Experience team and integrated with 23,000 recordings delivered from Redux. The matching dataset was gathered over a period of five months. For a BBC Digital Media Initiative (DMI) demonstration entitled \\"Million Minutes\\", files from the BBC's D-3 video tape archive were imported into the Redux system during 2009‚Äì2010. This also used commercial software from Artesia Digital Media Group and involved creating a representational state transfer (REST) interface onto the content stored within Redux. During 2010, Safari and Google Chrome browser extensions were developed to integrate Redux content with the main www.bbc.co.uk/programmes directory. In January 2012, the BBC's Multimedia Classification team announced they were hoping to test and add \\"mood-based navigation\\" to the existing BBC Redux interface, along with audience measurement and other rich metadata comprising work part-funded by the Technology Strategy Board. During 2010‚Äì2011 BBC Research and Development integrated content archived in BBC Redux with the BBC's existing internal BBC InFax system, allowing finding of metadata and archive content within the same browser window, covering news and subtitles from over the previous five years. During March 2012, the Atlas index changed the method of equivalence matching used for indexing against BBC Redux.

It is one of the biggest Black motorcycle clubs in the USA and the biggest African American motorcycle club in Chicago, with 140+ chapters as of 2019, with over 5000 members across the USA.Ebony, Oct 2007. P.106Buffalo Soldier MC, NAACP Today Show, 2010 History The first club chapter was founded by Ken Thomas, a Chicago police officer, in 1993 or 1994. The National Association of Buffalo Soldiers/Troopers Motorcycle Clubs (NABSTMC) was formed c. 1999. The organization was officially created at the 1999 National Round- Up. There a meeting was held, invited to that meeting were Presidents and Vice Presidents of most of the MC that at the time were using the name Buffalo Soldiers. There were 5 clubs loosely aligned but using the Chicago scholey(emblem worn on the uniform vest). Those clubs were Chicago, IL(Troopers), Florida, Delaware, Virginia, and New Jersey, and California. There also were representatives from Chicago, IL(Buffalo Soldier MC) , Grand Rapids, MI, Dallas TX, Kokomo, IN, St Louis MO, and Harrisburg, PA. Each of those clubs had their own individual scholey(emblem worn on the uniform vest). The meeting was organized by Carl Laury who several years earlier had taken the Chicago scholey to Florida and created the third chapter of what was to become organization. Laury had traveled across the US in 1999 visiting the above named MC to invite them to the meeting in an effort to unite the various factions under one banner. While the meeting failed to convince the reps from IL, MI, TX, IN, MO and PA of the need to organize the ByLaws that Laury presented to the entire group convinced the rest that it was time to move forward. Those initial ByLaws were ratified and set the principles in place that the organization still follows to this day.Carl Laury Activities Chapters participate in many charitable activities across the United States, including: providing \\"Soldiers' Thanksgiving\\" Thanksgiving turkeys, hams and other necessities for poor families in Tacoma, Washington; fundraising for victims of the 2010 Tennessee floods; highway adoption and adopting a nursing home for monthly visits in Clarksville, Tennessee and mentoring jail inmates in Alexandria, Virginia. They also have a historical educational program concerning the contributions made by their namesake Buffalo Soldiers of the U.S. Army. The group is enrolled as part of an official motorcycle safety mentorship program in cooperation with the United States Army. =Rallies= The group also is an organizer of the National Bikers Roundup, a national motorcycle rally that draws tens of thousands of participants who spend millions of dollars at the rally (estimated $10 million in 2004). The annual Buffalo Thunder Rally from Maryland suburbs to the African American Civil War Memorial in Washington D.C. started in 2002 or 2004. Some riders stay to participate in the subsequent Rolling Thunder Run motorcycle rally. About 1,500 riders participated in 2013. Membership and organization An academic paper on the organization and its context in African-American culture described it as a \\"unique recreational, service, and educational organization\\". The national headquarters official website states \\"we are not a 1% club and we claim no territory.\\" Membership requires possession of a 750 cc or greater displacement motorcycle from any manufacturer, a valid drivers license, and insurance. Membership includes African-American men and women, mostly active-duty and retired military, law enforcement and professionals. Identification as member of a particular race is not a membership requirement. The national organization is composed of several regional/geographic \\"frontiers\\" in the United States: Northeast; Southeast; Great Lakes; Central and Western. Within each frontier, there are local chapters; the first chapter in a state is designated the \\"mother chapter\\" with certain responsibilities for establishing new chapters. A member who relocates to an \\"open state\\", or certain other conditions, is a \\"member-at-large\\", who is affiliated with the national group but not any local chapter.

The crustacean was given its English nickname in 2010 by UK deep-sea scientists aboard the RRS James Cook, owing to resemblance between its dense covering of setae on the ventral surface of the exoskeleton and the hairy chest of the actor David Hasselhoff. The 2010 expedition to explore hydrothermal vents on the East Scotia Ridge was the second of three expeditions to the Southern Ocean by the UK led research consortium, ChEsSo (Chemosynthetic Ecosystems of the Southern Ocean). Distribution Location of E2 and E9 sites in the Scotia Sea showing the East Scotia Ridge (ESR) between the Scotia Plate (SCO) and South Sandwich Plate (SAN) This species ‚Äì the only member of its genus found outside the Pacific Ocean, is known from two sites adjacent to and on the chimney sides of hydrothermal vents in the East Scotia Ridge of the south Atlantic Ocean: from around depth at the E9 vent site and from around depth at the E2 site. Description Phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA gene and a range of other anomuran crustaceans, using Bayesian inference, places this species from the East Scotia Ridge as a sister taxon to Kiwa hirsuta, with a sequence divergence from this species of 6.45%, which is consistent for within-genus divergence in squat lobsters.  Ecology  Population of Kiwa around a hydrothermal vent Unlike Kiwa hirsuta and Kiwa puravida, which are notable for having a dense covering of setae on their elongated chelae, this species has shorter chelae, with most of the setae concentrated instead on the ventral surface of the crab. Filamentous bacteria were found on the setae and similar-looking sulfur-oxidising bacteria have been found amongst the setae of Kiwa hirsuta and Kiwa puravida. It has been hypothesised that these sulfur-oxidising bacteria, which fix carbon from the water by oxidising sulfides in the hydrothermal fluid, are a significant source of nutrition to the crabs. The Hoff crabs were found living adjacent to and on the sides of hydrothermal vent chimneys living in close proximity to fluid emanating from the chimneys at temperatures greater than of . At E9, densities of the crabs were observed in excess of 600 per square metre (56 per square foot). Small limpets (a new species of Lepetodrilus) are often found on the carapace apparently grazing on bacteria. Other marine fauna, such as sea anemones (family Actinostolidae), gastropods Gigantopelta chessoia, a species of stalked barnacle (most likely of the genus Vulcanolepas), a pycnogonid close to the genus Sericosura, and a predatory seven armed starfish can be found living together with this species.  Media  The \\"Hoff crab\\" nickname was widely reported in the media whilst the species still lacked a binomial name, and David Hasselhoff tweeted favourably in response to his \\"Hoff\\" moniker being used to describe a hydrothermal vent crab. The species was later given the binomial name Kiwa tyleri, after its discoverer, Paul Tyler of Southampton University. References This article incorporates CC-BY-2.5 text from Rogers et al. (2012).

The plot centers on a married couple who, frustrated by the lack of sex in their relationship, allow each other a one-night stand.  Synopsis  In Los Angeles, Annie and Darren are a married couple in a comfortable relationship that's lost its spark. They talk constantly, express affection verbally, start the day with high-end coffee, end the afternoon with gelato, shop at the farmer's market, prepare dinner as a team, do crossword puzzles, and talk in bed. Darren wonders if a one-night stand would help bring more sex to their marriage. Soon, the two of them are laying out the ground rules and talking through the mechanics of each finding a lover for one night. They agree to give each other no details about the experience. The night comes. Will this give their relationship a needed boost?  Plot  Darren (Dax Shepard) and Annie (Katie Aselton) have an enviable relationship built on love, trust and communication‚Äîthey still enjoy each other's company and laugh at each other's jokes. Unfortunately, they can't remember the last time they had sex. When a dinner party conversation leads to an honest discussion about the state of their love life, and when a sexy bikini photo shoot leads to crossword puzzles instead of sex, they begin to flirt with an idea for a way to spice things up. The deal: one night of freedom, no strings attached, no questions asked. Could a \\"freebie\\" be the cure for their ailing sex life? And will they go through with it?

Genesis The novel's origins lie in a commission by the Dutch foundation Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek, an organization that promotes Dutch literature. Reve had been asked to supply the 1981 Boekenweekgeschenk, a free book given to every buyer of a Dutch-language book during a one-week nationwide promotion known as Boekenweek (\\"Book Week\\"). Since Reve is homosexual and a Catholic convert, and often combines those themes in his work, the organization stipulated that no gay subject matter was to be touched upon. In the end, Reve did include a bit of gay sex in the book, enough for the foundation to refuse his offering as too controversial. The 1981 Boekenweekgeschenk was Henri Knap's De Ronde van '43, which was widely panned by critics. Reve published De vierde man with Elsevier/Manteau in 1981. Synopsis The novel is a frame narrative. A writer named Gerard recounts the events that happened years before to his friend, Ronald. The story is as follows: Gerard, after a speaking engagement in the town of V., in the southern Netherlands, has a brief affair with a woman named Christine, with whom he spends the night. After seeing a photograph of her boyfriend, Herman, he becomes infatuated with him. Later, he spends a weekend house-sitting for Christine (during this time he picks up a young man named Laurens and has sex with him in Christine's bed) and opens a little chest reminiscent of a coffin, with a key he recognizes from a dream he had earlier. The box contains documents proving that Christine is three times widowed, and another dream he had comes to mind, in which an old man sang a tune asking who would be the fourth man. He leaves the house in a panic; later he hears that Herman was horribly mutilated after an accident in Christine's car. Critical reception On the whole, Dutch critics were pleased with Reve's \\"in-between\\" novel, with the notable exception of Alfred Kossmann. One critic, Ivan Sitniakowsky, commented that this was Reve without chitchat, which many of his recent novels had been full of. That same critic considered De vierde man to be a true Dutch gothic novel. Film version Paul Verhoeven's adaptation makes some changes to the original: the horror effects are emphasized, and the gay affair with Laurens is scrapped. In addition, the film adds an encounter between Gerard (played by Jeroen Krabb√©) and Herman (Thom Hoffman), and a sex scene in a tomb between them. The tomb also contains urns with the ashes of the former husbands of Christine (Ren√©e Soutendijk). This film, seen as a revenge on the critics who criticized his Spetters (1980) as \\"filthy, violent, and even boring\\", was Verhoeven's last film in Dutch until Zwartboek (2006).

They founded the food company L√∏gismose, named after the family estate L√∏gismose Castle, as well as the gourmet restaurants Falsled Kro and Kong Hans K√¶lder. Biography Falsled Kro Sven Gr√∏nlykke began his career in sales of farming machines and later made a move into production of foam rubber for the furniture industry with factories in Germany, Sweden, Norway and Spain. In 1953 he married Lene (born Meyer Petersen), who was a journalist, and after making a fortune from the sale of their business empire the couple acquired the ASA Filmudlejning in Copenhagen in 1964 to pursue a career in film-making as well as L√∏gismose Castle on the island of Funen in 1965. Writing and directing the films in collaboration, they first made the children's film Thomas er fredl√∏s from 1967 and then experienced a breakthrough with The Ballad of Carl-Henning, inspired by the French New Wave and won the Danish Film Critics Award for Best Danish Film on 1969. Over the next few years Sven Gr√∏nlykke produced a number of films before they sold their film studio to the Danish state in 1972. The couple had plans to open a restaurant in the Basque Country but instead ended up buying the run down Falsled Kro, located not far from their Funen estate, turning it into a boutique hotel and French-style gourmet restaurant. They also began to produce cheese and chocolate on their L√∏gismose estate and to import French wines, naming their company L√∏gismose after the estate. In 1976 they opened the restaurant Kong Hans K√¶lder in Copenhagen together with the writer Klaus Rifbjerg and his wife Inge. In 1981 they released their third and last film, Thorvald og Linda, a drama set among railway workers in Jutland in 1912.

In PIMD, one uses the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation to separate the wavefunction into a nuclear part and an electronic part. The nuclei are treated quantum mechanically by mapping each quantum nucleus onto a classical system of several fictitious particles connected by springs (harmonic potentials) governed by an effective Hamiltonian, which is derived from Feynman's path integral. The resulting classical system, although complex, can be solved relatively quickly. There are now a number of commonly used condensed matter computer simulation techniques that make use of the path integral formulation including Centroid Molecular Dynamics (CMD), Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics (RPMD), and the Feynman-Kleinert Quasi-Classical Wigner (FK-QCW) method. The same techniques are also used in path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC).

Rep. 1a, 77 ER 377, reprinted in The Reports of Sir Edward Coke, In Thirteen Parts, A New Edition, vol. 4, p. 1 (London, Joseph Butterworth and Son 1826). was a 1608 English legal decision establishing that a child born in Scotland, after the Union of the Crowns under James VI and I in 1603, was considered under the common law to be an English subject and entitled to the benefits of English law. Calvin's Case was eventually adopted by courts in the United States, and the case played an important role in shaping the American rule of birthright citizenship via jus soli (\\"law of the soil\\", or citizenship by virtue of birth within the territory of a sovereign state). However, the case has also been cited as providing legal justification for the restriction of legal rights to Native Americans following their widespread conquest or confinement in reservations by the colonial forces of North America. Facts Under the feudal system, the allegiance owed to a king by his subjects‚Äîconnected as it was to the holding of interests in land‚Äîruled out the possibility of any given individual holding land in two different kingdoms. Robert Calvin, born in Scotland around 1606, inherited estates in England, but his rights thereto were challenged on the grounds that, as a Scot, he could not legally own English land.Price (1997), pp. 81‚Äì82. As it happened, the child \\"Robert Calvin\\" was actually named James Colville; he was the son of Robert Colville, Master of Culross, and grandson of the courtier James Colville, 1st Lord Colville of Culross. Judgment The Court of King's Bench ruled in Calvin's favour, finding that he was not an alien and did have the right to hold land in England.Sir Edward Coke, The Selected Writings and Speeches of Sir Edward Coke, ed. Steve Sheppard (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2003). Vol. 1. 31 March 2017. Although not directly relevant to the case, Edward Coke used the occasion to discuss the position of \\"Perpetual enemies\\", specifying \\"All Infidels are in Law perpetui inimici (perpetual enemies)\\" (166). Having accepted that a King who conquers a Christian Kingdom is constrained by the continuance of such laws as exist until new laws are put in place, he continues, however \\"if a Christian King should conquer a kingdom of an Infidel, and bring them under his subjection, there ipso facto the Laws of the Infidel are abrogated, for that they be not only against Christianity, but against the Law of God and of Nature.\\" (170). Robert A. Williams Jr. argues that Coke used this occasion to quietly provide a legal sanction for the London Virginia Company to dispense with affording Native Americans any rights as they settled in Virginia. The test case went to a panel of 14 judges drawn from different courts. Two of those dissented: Sir Thomas Foster (1548‚Äì1612) and Sir Thomas Walmsley. Significance =Postnati and antenati= James, King of Scots, inherited the throne of England in 1603, uniting both kingdoms under a single monarch. The decision in Calvin's Case hinged on Calvin's status as one of the postnati‚Äîsubjects born into the allegiance of the Scottish king James after he had become the king of England in 1603‚Äîand on the fact that the monarch into whose allegiance he was born (the same James, in his capacity as King of Scots) was also the English king at the time of Calvin's birth‚Äîmeaning that Robert Calvin, in the judgement of the court, was just as much a subject of the king of England as if he had been born in England instead of Scotland. The judges of the court cited existing statutes‚Äîincluding particularly a 1351 statute, De Natis Ultra Mare, which granted the benefits of subject status to foreign-born children of the king's subjects‚Äîas supporting the concept that allegiance was tied to the person of the king, rather than to the kingdom itself or to its laws.Price (1997), p. 101‚Äì102. Calvin's Case did not extend English subject status to the antenati (Scots born prior to 1603). They remained aliens in relation to England, on the theory that King James had not yet become the king of England at the time of their birth.Price (1997), p. 117. Attempts had been made in the English Parliament, prior to Calvin's Case, to naturalise all of James's Scottish subjects‚Äîboth those born after his English accession in 1603 (the postnati), and also those born before 1603 (the antenati)‚Äîbut these legislative efforts had been unsuccessful.Price (1997), p. 96. Concerns had been expressed that extending the privileges of English subjects to all Scots would cause England to be flooded by \\"an influx of 'hungry Scots'\\".Price (1997), p. 97. Objections were also raised that granting naturalisation to all the Scots would have encouraged the legal philosophy, espoused by James, of absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings.Price (1997), pp. 98‚Äì99. Even after Calvin's Case, the English Parliament could have enacted a naturalisation bill covering the antenati, but it never did so.Price (1997), p. 119. =Later influence= Calvin's Case contributed to the concept of the Rights of Englishmen.Hulsebosch, Daniel J., The Ancient Constitution and the Expanding Empire: Sir Edward Coke's British Jurisprudence.

In fact, one scholar asserts that the legal apologists for the American Revolution claimed they had \\"improved on the rights of Englishmen\\" by creating additional, purely American rights. Owing to its inclusion in the standard legal treatises of the nineteenth century (compiled by Edward Coke, William Blackstone, and James Kent), Calvin's Case was well known in the early judicial history of the United States. Consideration of the case by the United States Supreme Court and by state courts transformed it into a rule regarding American citizenship and solidified the concept of jus soli as the primary determining factor controlling the acquisition of citizenship by birth.Price (1997), p. 138‚Äì139.

The company was consistently productive between its founding in 1975 and 1999, but is still active, producing the occasional film and TV series project. It has produced more than 25 American primetime television series, mostly half-hour sitcoms. Witt/Thomas is perhaps best known for producing the popular sitcoms Soap, Benson, It's a Living, The Golden Girls (along with its sequel, The Golden Palace), Empty Nest, Blossom and Brotherly Love. Witt and Thomas have also produced many cinematic works, including the 1989 box office success Dead Poets Society. Numerous Witt/Thomas television series were created and co- executive produced by Susan Harris, the wife of Paul Junger Witt. The shows that had involvement from Harris were produced under the modified by Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions nameplate. History =Beginnings and work with Susan Harris= The partnership between Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas began in 1971, when the two were paired together as producers on the now- classic and influential ABC made-for-TV-movie Brian's Song. Following this, Witt and Thomas elected to continue working together on additional TV movies for all the major American broadcast networks. After having each built an extensive resume separately as TV producers, aside from their partnership (Witt had producing experience on TV series, including The Partridge Family and The Rookies, and Thomas was by now tenured in telefilms), the two formed Witt/Thomas Productions in 1975 upon selling their first TV pilot, the NBC comedy Fay. The sitcom, which premiered in the fall of 1975, was created by Susan Harris, who instantly became a key partner in the production company (and later entered into a relationship with Witt, which culminated in their 1983 marriage). Fay failed to find an audience, and was cancelled after a single, heavily interrupted season. However, shortly after picking up Fay for the fall 1975 schedule, NBC had bought a second pilot from Witt and Thomas, which was granted a midseason replacement slot for early the following year. Premiering in January 1976 was The Practice, a comedy set in a family-run doctor's office, the first series to be strictly a Witt/Thomas Production (sans Harris). The series was created for Witt/Thomas by Steve Gordon, who later became known for writing and directing the blockbuster film Arthur (1981). This was also the first of three TV series the company produced in which Thomas' father, Danny Thomas, was cast in the starring role. The Practice performed well enough to be awarded a second season, but the early ratings success was not sustained. NBC cancelled the series in January 1977, after exactly 12 months on the air. In the spring of 1977, CBS broadcast another of the companys efforts, the romantic comedy Loves Me, Loves Me Not, created by Harris and starring Susan Dey, but it lasted only six episodes. The series reunited Witt with Dey, who whom he had worked with on The Partridge Family; the show additionally featured two actors who would again work for Witt/Thomas, Kenneth Gilman (who later starred on Nurses) and Art Metrano (of the short-lived Tough Cookies). Witt, Thomas and Harris would soon find success with their next pilot, a sitcom parody of daytime soap operas entitled Soap. ABC picked up the series, which drew controversy over its tawdry and taboo storylines from the day it was announced on the network's schedule. Soap premiered in September 1977 to further controversy (several ABC affiliates chose to preempt the show during the 1977‚Äì78 season), but blockbuster ratings, and cemented Witt, Thomas and Harris as producers of breakthrough, socially relevant television. In the midst of Soap's success, the company would produce the spin-off series Benson, for Soap regular Robert Guillaume, which debuted in September 1979. By this time, Witt/Thomas (and Harris) were experiencing increased demand, primarily by ABC. In 1980, the producers sold the series I'm a Big Girl Now to ABC, which paired Danny Thomas with Soap star Diana Canova in the lead roles. Both Soap and I'm a Big Girl Now were cancelled in 1981, with Benson continuing until 1986, lasting longer than its parent show. 1980s Subsequent shows with a Witt/Thomas/Harris collaboration include It Takes Two (ABC, 1982‚Äì83), a single-season comedy starring Patty Duke Astin and Richard Crenna as a modern, dual-career couple; Hail to the Chief (ABC, 1985), another starring vehicle for Ms. Astin, in which she played the first female president of the United States; and The Golden Girls (NBC, 1985‚Äì1992), a comedy inspired by a segment of NBC's 1984 fall preview special, which featured comedic interplay between NBC stars Selma Diamond and Doris Roberts, who hosted the segment. Diamond spoke of a new series they were about to preview, about elderly women living in a Miami home, entitled \\"Miami Nice\\". Roberts corrected Diamond, stating that they were about to take a sneak peek at Miami Vice. The Golden Girls, which centered on four older women rooming together and enjoying their golden years, went on to become, arguably, the biggest success for Witt/Thomas/Harris, garnering several Emmy nominations (and wins for each of the show's four principal stars) and strong ratings. The series produced an equally successful spin-off in 1988, Empty Nest, which starred Richard Mulligan as eligible older bachelor Dr. Harry Weston, who lived and held medical practice in the same neighborhood as The Golden Girls. In 1987, Witt/Thomas/Harris had the new sitcom project Mama's Boy in development for NBC. It served as a starring vehicle for Bruce Weitz and Nancy Walker, in which the former played a successful journalist whose loving mother (Walker) moves into his New York apartment and interrupts his bachelor lifestyle. Susan Blakely and Dan Hedaya also starred. Mama's Boy was picked up by the network, but only retained the status of being a \\"special\\" throughout the 1987‚Äì88 season, due to its irregular scheduling. After a preview broadcast on September 19, 1987, it only aired five more times, over several months, between October 31 of that year and August 6, 1988. The seventh episode was never aired. 1990s In the 1990s, Harris created four more series for the company, beginning with the Empty Nest spin-off Nurses, which aired alongside its parent series and The Golden Girls on NBC's Saturday night lineup. With all three of the latter series taking place in the same section of Miami (with Nurses focusing on the nurses' station and upper levels of the same hospital that employed Dr. Harry Weston), Witt/Thomas/Harris was thus able to create the rarity of a single, unified storyline carrying through all three programs in the same night. This practice continued between Empty Nest and Nurses alone after The Golden Girls ended its run in 1992. When it was announced that The Golden Girls would conclude in its seventh season, in the wake of star Bea Arthur's decision to leave, Harris immediately transported the remaining three \\"girls\\" (Betty White, Rue McClanahan, Estelle Getty) into the sequel series The Golden Palace. NBC originally committed to airing the sequel, but CBS offered Witt, Thomas and Harris a better deal (24 episodes, versus NBC's agreement to 13). The Golden Palace premiered on CBS in September 1992, and nearly replicated the success of The Golden Girls in terms of ratings. However, at the end of its inaugural season, CBS decided to drop certain series with older demographics, and The Golden Palace fell victim to this plan. Estelle Getty would bring her long-running role of Sophia Petrillo back to NBC in the fall of 1993, when Witt/Thomas/Harris decided to move the character to Empty Nest. Getty continued on Empty Nest until the end of its run in 1995. Nurses, meanwhile, was cancelled by NBC at the end of its third season in 1994. Harris' other 1990s creations were short-lived: Good & Evil (ABC, 1991), a variation of her successful Soap formula, in which the struggle of two sisters, one evil and conniving (played by Teri Garr) and the other sweet and pure (played by Margaret Whitton) was chronicled. Good & Evil, which was placed in the unusual-for-a-sitcom 10:30/9:30c slot on Wednesdays, was poorly rated, and in addition, a blind psychologist character (played by Mark Blankfield) brought the series under fire by the National Federation of the Blind for negatively portraying blind people as clumsy and clueless (though, coincidentally, Blankfield would go on to play a blind man of questionable portrayal in Robin Hood: Men in Tights to little criticism). As a result, ABC cancelled the series after only six episodes. After this experience, Harris vowed in the press that she would never work with ABC ever again, feeling that the network had sabotaged Good & Evil from the beginning. Witt and Thomas were apparently in agreement with Harris; it would be five years before Witt and Thomas alone would enter into a new development deal with ABC (for Common Law). In 1998, Harris rekindled her relationship with ABC, and created what has been her last TV series to date, The Secret Lives of Men. A comedy centering on the camaraderie of three middle-aged bachelors, it received heavy promotion, but was another short-lived venture. The series was dropped by ABC in November 1998, after only two months on the air, hardly lasting longer than Good & Evil, the series that caused Harris to cut ties with the network in the first place. =Work with other creators and producers= During the 1980s and 1990s, Witt/Thomas continued their producing streak, with many of their shows still having involvement from Harris, and several in between that were serviced by other creators. From 1979 until 1983, John Rich (later known for co-producing MacGyver with Henry Winkler) was a top-tier producer with Witt and Thomas on Benson, and later on the company's short-lived Condo. In 1991, Rich briefly returned to the company as an executive producer on the short- lived NBC sitcom Walter & Emily. Witt/Thomas brought It's a Living to ABC's fall schedule in 1980, a comedy centered on four buxom waitresses who worked for a posh restaurant atop a Los Angeles hotel, and the fraternizing that went on between them. The series, created by Stu Silver, Dick Clair and Jenna McMahon, ran on ABC for two seasons, with the second season airing under the modified title Making a Living. Syndication reruns which aired a year after the series' cancellation (see below) brought the show a whole new audience; the series was revived under its original title for first-run syndication, and ran four additional seasons (1985‚Äì1989). Witt/Thomas also produced the short- lived 1983 ABC sitcom Condo, from creator Sheldon Bull. Although it had no involvement from Susan Harris, Condo featured elements of Soap, in which two families, related by marriage, were the focus, along with the in-fighting that went on between both sides. Other Witt/Thomas series during the mid-1980s that were created by people other than Susan Harris included the short-lived CBS sitcom Tough Cookies (1986), which starred Robby Benson as a young maverick detective, and One Big Family (1986‚Äì1987), a first-run syndication series which was the third (and final) Witt/Thomas comedy vehicle for Danny Thomas. The latter was the only series from the company in which one of the partners (Witt) had co-creation credit, in this case with David Pollock and Elias Davis. In 1990, Golden Girls writers/producers Tracy Gamble and Richard Vaczy were hired by Witt/Thomas to create a sitcom pilot, which was ultimately not picked up for series status. In June of that year, their summer pilot We'll Take Manhattan aired, in which Jack√©e and Corinne Bohrer starred as polar opposites‚Äîa sassy city girl and a naive Southern belle, respectively‚Äîwho both attempt to make it in New York City together. The cast also featured Joel Brooks, Fred Applegate and Edan Gross (who had recently starred with Bohrer on the ABC sitcom Free Spirit). We'll Take Manhattan was NBC's second attempt to place Jack√©e in her own headlined series after her departure from the network's 227, on which she found massive fame. Her first starring vehicle, the 227 spinoff Jack√©e, had not been picked up the previous year. Gamble and Vaczy had previously worked on 227 before their hiring by Witt/Thomas. In 1991, Witt/Thomas struck a development deal with the young Fox network, for a pilot created and written by Andy Guerdat and Steve Kreinberg, a pair who had first worked for Witt/Thomas as writers on It's a Living from 1985 to 1987, among their numerous other credits. The pilot was Herman's Head, an irreverent sitcom starring William Ragsdale as a young publishing company fact checker whose thought processes were explored through a \\"Greek chorus\\" of human emotions that lived in his head. The series developed a cult following on Fox upon its September 1991 premiere, and lasted three seasons. Paul Perlove, who had served as an executive producer during the first season of the Witt/Thomas series Blossom (see below), created his own series for the company, Walter & Emily, which had a brief run on NBC from November 1991 until February 1992. It starred Cloris Leachman and Brian Keith in the title roles, and focused on the generation gap they faced between their adult son and grandson. Witt/Thomas launched their second series for Fox in the fall of 1992, which perhaps had the most unusual premise of all of their shows: Woops!, a comedy taking place in a post-Apocalyptic US, in which six adult survivors of the mysterious nuclear blast found themselves congregating in an abandoned farm house and living together, depending on each other for survival. The series was created and co-executive produced by Gary Jacobs, following his producing work on the successful Empty Nest, and featured Evan Handler, Fred Applegate and Lane Davies (who had worked on Good & Evil in 1991) in the cast. The wild premise for Woops! was perceived as being somewhat limited in its development, due to the small Earth population in the storyline, but the series only had a few months to prove itself before getting axed in December 1992. In 1994, David Landsberg (a former producer of Blossom and Herman's Head), and Brenda Hampton (another Blossom producer), had a Witt/Thomas pilot of theirs, Daddy's Girls, be picked up by CBS. Dudley Moore headlined this comedy, in which his character, Dudley Walker, a flamboyant Englishman whose deceased wife leaves him a clothing empire, tries to balance his empire along with fussing over his three attractive young daughters (played by Stacy Galina, Meredith Scott Lynn and Keri Russell). Playing opposite Moore was Harvey Fierstein in a rare TV series role, as Dudley's prissy, overtly gay business partner. Critics lambasted Daddy's Girls even before its September 1994 debut, predicting it would not last until Christmas; CBS indeed only aired three episodes, before placing it on a hiatus it ended up never returning from. Later in the 1994‚Äì95 season, CBS picked up another Witt/Thomas pilot, The Office, created by veteran producer Susan Beavers (who had previously produced Nurses for Witt/Thomas) and Barbara Corday, co-creator of former CBS feminist-slanted police drama Cagney & Lacey. The comedy centered on the camaraderie of numerous executives and their secretaries at a packaging company, with the cast headed by Valerie Harper and Dakin Matthews. The series had a brief spring run during March and April 1995. It has no relation to the later British series The Office, or its American NBC counterpart (2005‚Äì2013). In 1996, the last Witt/Thomas development deal with Fox resulted in the short- lived sitcom Local Heroes. Created by Frank Mula, a writer and producer of The Simpsons, the comedy was described as a \\"blue-collar version of Friends\\", as it depicted the close-knit friendship of several young men and women who were just getting by in a small town. Local Heroes notably starred Jay Mohr, along with three actors from previous Witt/Thomas series‚ÄîJason Kristofer, from the short-lived Heartland (1989), Ken Hudson Campbell of Herman's Head and Kristin Dattilo of the previous year's The Office. Keeping with the tradition of elevating producers within the company to creators, Witt/Thomas gave Mitchell Hurwitz, who had numerous producing roles on many Witt/Thomas series throughout the 1990s, the chance to create his own project, Everything's Relative, which turned up as a spring replacement series on NBC in 1999. A family comedy about an eccentric, slightly immature couple (Jeffrey Tambor and Jill Clayburgh) and their adult, upscale-professional but equally immature sons (Kevin Rahm and Eric Schaeffer), it received positive reviews that likened the diverse, interlocking stories to that of Seinfeld. Nonetheless, NBC only aired the series four times in April 1999 before cancelling it. Hurwitz would later team up with Ron Howard and 20th Century Fox to create and produce the Fox sitcom Arrested Development, in which he would again cast Jeffrey Tambor as an eccentric patriarch of an equally quirky family. Although it was not immediately realized, the quick demise of Everything's Relative would soon mark the end of Witt/Thomas Productions' 24-year television series producing streak. The company, however, remained intact, producing the occasional made-for-TV movie thereafter. Witt and Thomas would come out of their TV series retirement in 2012, with the revival of their dramatic series Beauty & the Beast. Don Reo In 1987, screenwriter Don Reo began his involvement with Witt/Thomas, writing for their NBC project Mama's Boy. Reo soon went on to create several series for the company, in conjunction with his nameplate, Impact Zone Productions. His first creation was the CBS sitcom Heartland, which starred Brian Keith as a cantankerous Nebraska farmer who moves in with his daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren. The series had a brief run in the spring of 1989, but Reo had other projects for Witt/Thomas which would soon hit the air. During the 1990‚Äì91 season, two more Reo series from Witt/Thomas premiered: Lenny, a sitcom vehicle for comedian Lenny Clarke, which debuted on CBS in September 1990; and Blossom, an NBC series starring Mayim Bialik whose pilot was previewed on July 5, 1990, and whose series premiere occurred on January 3, 1991. Lenny was a ratings failure, and was cancelled by CBS in March 1991; Blossom was more successful, enjoying a strong following among teenage viewers on NBC's youth-oriented Monday night comedy block (alongside freshman hit The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air), and ultimately ran until 1995, lasting five seasons. Following up his Blossom success for NBC, Reo acquired John Larroquette for a project soon after the conclusion of his long-running sitcom Night Court. This resulted in The John Larroquette Show on NBC's fall 1993 schedule. Specializing in dark, seedy humor, The John Larroquette Show was often found to be more controversial of a Witt/Thomas series than any of the ones that Susan Harris had created. Despite critical acclaim, the series was nearly cancelled by NBC at the end of its first season. The network ended up renewing the show on the agreement that Reo and Witt/Thomas would lighten the show's tone, and introduce more upbeat stories. Larroquette went through two more renewal periods on NBC, until getting cancelled in October 1996, just five weeks into its fourth season. Reo would create one more series for Witt/Thomas, the Rhea Perlman vehicle Pearl, which ran on CBS during the 1996‚Äì97 season, in which Perlman herself joined Reo, Witt, Thomas and Gary S. Levine as an executive producer. Gary S. Levine Witt and Thomas would again take on a third partner in their production team, when they inducted Gary S. Levine as a top-tier producer in the company in 1994. Levine worked with Witt/Thomas for the next three years on five of their new shows, and was listed along with them on each show's top \\"executive producers\\" credit. His surname, however, was never added to the Witt/Thomas Productions names (similar to how former partner John Rich was never incorporated into the company name; Susan Harris, as Witt's wife, remains the only third partner to have her name included in the production marquee). Witt/Thomas and Levine's first project together provided yet another Blossom producer, Rob LaZebnik, the chance to create his own pilot. The project was greenlighted by the upstart WB Television Network in 1994. For The WB's launch in January 1995, the company produced the LaZebnik creation Muscle, yet another soap-opera spoof, this time taking on the youth-oriented dramas of the 1990s, primarily Melrose Place. The series, like Susan Harris creations Soap and Good & Evil before it, was critically acclaimed; The WB, however, cancelled it at the end of its first season (it was, in fact, the first series to be cancelled on the new network). A year later, Witt/Thomas and Levine produced a new LaZebnik series, Common Law, that premiered on ABC in September 1996. The series was lauded for featuring a lead character of Latino heritage (played by Greg Giraldo) in a prestigious profession, that of partner in his own law firm. Despite the praise, Common Law suffered from low ratings, airing Saturdays at 9:30/8:30c. ABC cancelled the series after only a month on the air (just a week before NBC abruptly dropped its Witt/Thomas sister series, The John Larroquette Show). In the fall of 1995, Witt/Thomas and Levine had two new youth-oriented comedies of theirs premiere on NBC's Sunday schedule, Brotherly Love and Minor Adjustments. When Blossom was concluding its run the previous spring, two of its producers, Jonathan Schmock and Jim Vallely, received a development deal with NBC and Witt/Thomas that would give Blossom star Joey Lawrence his own starring vehicle. The result was Brotherly Love, in which Lawrence played an entirely new character alongside real-life brothers Matthew and Andrew Lawrence. Following the series was Minor Adjustments, a comedy about a child psychologist and his relationships with his family and patients, starring stand-up comic Rondell Sheridan. The series was created by Sheridan, Ken Estin and Dwayne Johnson-Cochran, and certain episodes were directed by Soap and Empty Nest star Dinah Manoff. Minor Adjustments was cancelled by NBC in December 1995, but in a rather unusual move, the fledgling UPN network bought the show's rights, and returned it to the air only one month later, thus allowing the series to continue its freshman season. By the spring of 1996, UPN had cancelled Minor Adjustments as well, and Brotherly Love was dropped by NBC, only to get a second (and final) season on The WB. Levine also partnered with Witt and Thomas during the 1996‚Äì97 season to co-executive produce the company's CBS sitcom, Pearl. =Beauty and the Beast= Witt/Thomas, while primarily known for comedies, ventured into the production of a dramatic series in 1987, with the CBS fantasy drama Beauty and the Beast. Creator Ron Koslow and parent studio Tri- Star Television hired Witt and Thomas as executive producers on the series when the two wished to diversify their TV series producing resume (Koslow had first worked with Witt/Thomas on their 1984 theatrical film Firstborn). The early success of Beauty and the Beast made Witt and Thomas one of the most prolific showrunners on American network TV in the late 1980s, between their working for two different studios simultaneously (Touchstone and Tri-Star) and the ratings success of their series. Witt and Thomas served as executive producers for all three seasons of Beauty and the Beast, and for the majority of their career, it remained the only hour-long dramatic series produced by Witt/Thomas Productions. In 2012, it was announced that Koslow, Witt and Thomas had pitched a new version of Beauty & the Beast to The CW network. In May of that year, the series was picked up for The CW's 2012‚Äì13 fall schedule, and had its premiere on October 11, 2012. An entirely new cast is featured in the revival, in many of the same roles that appeared in the CBS version. Although Koslow is involved in the new series as an executive producer, the format for the revival was created by Sherri Cooper and Jennifer Levin. Witt and Thomas will again serve as executive producers as well, marking the first time in thirteen years that the two have produced a weekly primetime series together. The series concluded in 2016. =Lean years and return to TV series producing= In 2014, after having been back into TV series producing for two years with The CW's Beauty & the Beast, Witt/Thomas announced that they had screened a sitcom pilot written by Sally Robinson (best known for penning Lifetime's 2012 remake of Steel Magnolias) under the working title Feed Me. Witt and Thomas agreed to produce it, and soon shopped it to NBC, which put it in the running for fall 2014 comedy pilots. While the network had it under consideration, Witt and Thomas were lauded by the press for making a much heralded-return to sitcom producing, the last of which had been 15 years prior, and for resuming a relationship with NBC, which had been home to their classic hits The Golden Girls, Empty Nest, and many other Witt/Thomas shows. Feed Me was described as centering on \\"..a dysfunctional family bound by love and the restaurant they run together.\\" The series was slated to star Mary- Louise Parker (a headlining role in response to her success on Showtime's Weeds), along with Andrea Parker, Ed Quinn and Toks Olagundoye. In May 2014, however, NBC passed on greenlighting the pilot. =Distribution and parent studios= Throughout its history, Witt/Thomas Productions has housed its shows at a number of different parent studios. With their first two series in the 1975‚Äì1976 season, Fay and The Practice, Witt/Thomas worked in association with Universal and MGM respectively. Their 1977 CBS sitcom, Loves Me, Loves Me Not, remains to date the only series from the company to be produced at 20th Century Fox Television. Beginning with Soap, and encompassing all of their ABC series that aired between 1977 and 1986, Witt/Thomas started the practice of completely financing their shows themselves, without the presence of a parent studio. On most of the shows from this era, \\"A Witt/Thomas/Harris Production\\" would be featured at the end of their closing credit sequences, with copyright notice going to Witt/Thomas/Harris in lieu of a major studio. However, during the 1982‚Äì83 season, the short-lived It Takes Two and Condo had their copyright notices go to a dummy company that would be named after the respective program (i.e. \\"It Takes Two Productions\\" and \\"Condo Productions\\", respectively). With the latter shows, the Witt/Thomas/Harris or Witt/Thomas bylines would still appear before the \\"dummy\\" copyright. When Soap and Benson both went into off- network reruns during the early 1980s, their syndication rights were sold to Columbia Pictures Television. For the 1983‚Äì84 season, Witt/Thomas also chose to off-network syndicate reruns of their recent short-lived series, namely It's a Living and It Takes Two. Distribution of these shows were handled by Golden West Television, who provided the production facilities for most Witt/Thomas shows. It's a Living and It Takes Two were the rare instances of series going into rerun syndication when they each lasted far shorter than four seasons, or 100 episodes, the normal minimum for syndication. However, Living would later surpass the syndication minimum, with its original 1985‚Äì1989 episodes in first-run syndication being added several years later. With the launch of The Golden Girls in 1985, Witt/Thomas would move their series to Touchstone Television, who would go on to produce several more of their shows afterward. During the 1985‚Äì86 season, Benson remained independent of a major studio during what turned out to be its final season, while the first season of the It's a Living first-run syndication revival had Golden West as its parent studio. Golden West was acquired by Lorimar-Telepictures in 1986, with certain Witt/Thomas series being divested to Buena Vista Television for syndication distribution at that time. However, both the reruns and current original episodes of It's a Living, as well as the first-run syndicated One Big Family, had distribution handled by Lorimar-Telepictures from September 1986 onward. Witt/Thomas also worked with Republic Pictures from 1987 until 1990, for CBS' Beauty and the Beast. In 1993, while continuing to work with Touchstone, Witt/Thomas began to house several of their new series at Warner Bros. Television. The John Larroquette Show was the first of these projects to be produced under Warner Bros. For the next three years, the producers continued their series at both studios, although after the premiere of Brotherly Love in 1995, all new Witt/Thomas series were exclusively launched under Warner Bros. The company's Touchstone association ended in 1996, when production of Brotherly Love was moved to Walt Disney Television for its second and last year, which also coincided with the series' move from NBC to The WB. After the 1996‚Äì97 season, Witt/Thomas was only working with Warner Bros. for the remaining two series it launched after that point, The Secret Lives of Men and Everything's Relative.

Gameplay  In the game, the player can select between seven \\"operatives\\", which are the characters controlled throughout the playthrough. The skills vary depending on the character chosen to play. If the character dies, another operative can be selected with a different set of skills. When all characters had died, the game finishes. The player is also able to rescue operatives lost in the field, unlocking them for future playthroughs of the game or, alternatively, rescue a fallen agent who's just been killed. The character moves across large environments, sometimes with multiple paths, and destroys the environment and large amounts of monsters. The character is able to fire in any direction, jump, swap weapons, and activate a special mode.

He was National Secretary of the Young People's Socialist League from 1946 to 1947, and then from 1947 to 1948 he worked in the automotive industry in Flint, Michigan. Returning to Yale, he earned a master's degree in American studies in 1949 and a doctorate in 1955. Bone taught at Yale and at the University of California, Los Angeles, before joining the faculty at Teachers College, Columbia, where he taught from 1965 to 1990.. Works Bone's book The Negro Novel in America, his Yale dissertation, was published in two editions in 1958 and 1965, and translated into Japanese. Reviewer August Meier places it within the New Criticism movement, and calls it a \\"brilliant and provocative study\\".. In it, Bone identifies four periods of African-American literature: a period of assimilation into the white middle class from 1890 to 1920, the pluralism of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s, a period of naturalism and protest during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and a \\"revolt against protest\\" in the 1940s. He discusses in detail many novels from each period, reserving particular praise for Richard Wright's Native Son (1940) and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man (1952). Bone also wrote Down Home: A History of Afro-American Short Fiction from its Beginnings to the End of the Harlem Renaissance (Putnam, 1975) and a short book on Native Son author Richard Wright. A manuscript left unfinished at Bone's death was completed by Richard A. Courage and published as The Muse in Bronzeville: African American Creative Expression in Chicago, 1932-1950 (Rutgers University Press, 2011).

Early years Ines Donati was the daughter of David Donati, a shoemaker, and Ludmilla Bertolli, a clockmaker. She was described as a short girl with dark hair. She was a nationalist supporter from a young age, during the World War I years, and became known as \\"La Capitana\\" (the Captain) and \\"La Patriottica\\" (the Patriot). At age 18, Donati moved to Rome to pursue her education. She attended a convent school in Trastevere, where she studied Fine Arts. In Trastevere, she became involved in popular youth organizations such as Corpo Nazionale Giovani Esploratori ed Esploratrici Italiani (CNGEI, National Corps of Young Italian Scouts and Guides), similar to the Scouting and Girl Guides organizations in the English- speaking countries. She also joined the Italian Nationalist Association, and the Gruppo Giovanile Ruggero Fauro (Ruggero Fauro Youth Group) established by the Italian nationalist and irredentist Ruggero Timeus. She was the only female member of the Rome Italian nationalist group \\"Sempre Pronti\\" (Always Ready). She attended the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma with Piera Gatteschi Fondelli, both later enrolled in the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento on the same day.‚ÄúStoria di Piera e delle altre squadriste‚Äù During a 1920 labour strike by garbage collectors in Rome, Donati was one of two women (the other being Maria Rygier) who engaged in street cleaning. She also worked as a mail carrier and electrician during this period. The following year, during the 1921 Italian General Election, Donati participated in the civil voluntary service and created propaganda for the Fascist national candidates. On February 18, 1921, at the Caff√® Aragno in Rome, near the Montecitorio Palace, the Deputy of the Italian Socialist Party, Alceste Della Seta, was beaten, the second attack that he suffered. The first planned target of the attack was Nicola Bombacci, one of the founders of the Communist Party of Italy. She was arrested and spent one month in jail in connection with the attack. On July 31 she was attacked by the anti-Fascist group Arditi del Popolo in Trastevere, who spent 20 days in hospital as a result. In 1921 she received what Fascists would later call her \\"battesimo del fuoco\\" (baptism by fire) at Ravenna, the location of a nationalist congress; Luigi Federzoni described her as \\"fearless, standing between the whistle of bullets\\". Squadrismo and death In 1922, Donati was diagnosed with tuberculosis, which was difficult to treat at the time and usually resulted in death. Mussolini's March on Rome that year, viewed as a power grab, instigated the Italian General Strike by opponents of Fascism. The strike was organized by Alleanza del Lavoro (a 1922 labour group coalition) as well as Ancona. It had a disruptive effect on rail service. On August 2, a train derailed at Osimo. This resulted in the death of the firefighter Attilio Forlani, who was a veteran and a Fascist supporter, and many passengers were injured. Donati, although ill, took part in violent actions against strikers on August 5. With a paramilitary group, the squadrismo, nationalists, many coming from Central Italy, succeeded in occupying the city. Two strikers were killed, Amilcare Biancheria and Giuseppe Morelli. On September 28, Donati took part in rescue operations after a gunpowder explosion destroyed several homes in Pitelli. Donati was one of only several women who joined the Fascist March on Rome; After reaching Ancona, and possessing two pistols, she took a train to the capitol, and personally met Mussolini. In 1923 she applied to join the paramilitary Blackshirts (Voluntary Militia for National Security), created that year; on March 4, Mussolini responded: \\"I have known of her fame for a long time and know that she is a fierce Italian, an indomitable fascist\\". In 1924, her health deteriorated. She died of tuberculosis on November 3, in Matelica, at the age of 24 years, and was proclaimed a martyr by the Fascists. Some historians believe her last words were, \\"I wanted to be strong like a man, but forgot that I am a frail woman\\". The Fascist establishment in fact opposed Donati's assertive behaviour in support of their causes, a disinhibition that could \\"damage the movement in public opinion\\" The Fascists, according to their mentality, believed that woman should submit to man, in subjection and inferiority, and prohibited any political activity by women. Her reputation was used in propaganda by the Fascists however, and on the request of Achille Starace, Donati's body was exumed on March 23, 1933, and reburied at the Chapel of Heroes at the Verano cemetery in Rome. She was made into an icon of youth. In 1926, a health clinic in Matelica was dedicated to her. On October 17, 1937, a bronze statue of Donati was dedicated, designed by Rutilio Ceccolini and sculptor Luigi Gabrielli, in the vicinity of the square San Severino Marche. The presentation speech was delivered by Wanda Bruschi, wife of Raphael Gorjux and an important provincial fascist. The work was removed by the partisans in 1944, and rebuilt into a memorial to victims of all wars.

All metals have a shiny appearance (at least when freshly polished); are good conductors of heat and electricity; form alloys with other metals; and have at least one basic oxide. Metalloids are metallic-looking brittle solids that are either semiconductors or exist in semiconducting forms, and have amphoteric or weakly acidic oxides. Typical nonmetals have a dull, coloured or colourless appearance; are brittle when solid; are poor conductors of heat and electricity; and have acidic oxides. Most or some elements in each category share a range of other properties; a few elements have properties that are either anomalous given their category, or otherwise extraordinary. Properties =Metals= Pure (99.97%+) iron chips, electrolytically refined, accompanied by a high purity (99.9999% = 6N) 1 cm3 cube Metals appear lustrous (beneath any patina); form mixtures (alloys) when combined with other metals; tend to lose or share electrons when they react with other substances; and each forms at least one predominantly basic oxide. Most metals are silvery looking, high density, relatively soft and easily deformed solids with good electrical and thermal conductivity, closely packed structures, low ionisation energies and electronegativities, and are found naturally in combined states. Some metals appear coloured (Cu, Cs, Au), have low densities (e.g. Be, Al) or very high melting points (e.g. W, Nb), are liquids at or near room temperature (e.g. Hg, Ga), are brittle (e.g. Os, Bi), not easily machined (e.g. Ti, Re), or are noble (hard to oxidise, e.g. Au, Pt) or have nonmetallic structures (Mn and Ga are structurally analogous to, respectively, white P and I). Metals comprise the large majority of the elements, and can be subdivided into several different categories. From left to right in the periodic table, these categories include the highly reactive alkali metals; the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and radioactive actinides; the archetypal transition metals, and the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. Specialized subcategories such as the refractory metals and the noble metals also exist. =Metalloids= alt=A shiny silver-white medallion with a striated surface, irregular around the outside, with a square spiral-like pattern in the middle. Metalloids are metallic looking brittle solids; tend to share electrons when they react with other substances; have weakly acidic or amphoteric oxides; and are usually found naturally in combined states. Most are semiconductors, and moderate thermal conductors, and have structures that are more open than those of most metals. Some metalloids (As, Sb) conduct electricity like metals. The metalloids, as the smallest major category of elements, are not subdivided further). =Nonmetals= 25 ml of bromine, a dark red-brown liquid at room temperature Nonmetals have open structures (unless solidified from gaseous or liquid forms); tend to gain or share electrons when they react with other substances; and do not form distinctly basic oxides. Most are gases at room temperature; have relatively low densities; are poor electrical and thermal conductors; have relatively high ionisation energies and electronegativities; form acidic oxides; and are found naturally in uncombined states in large amounts. Some nonmetals (C, black P, S and Se) are brittle solids at room temperature (although each of these also have malleable, pliable or ductile allotropes). From left to right in the periodic table, the nonmetals can be subdivided into the reactive nonmetals which, being nearest to the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character, and the monatomic noble gases, which are almost completely inert. Comparison of properties =Overview= properties of metals and nonmetals are quite distinct, as shown in the table below. Metalloids, straddling the metal-nonmetal border, are mostly distinct from either, but in a few properties resemble one or the other, as shown in the shading of the metalloid column below and summarized in the small table at the top of this section. Authors differ in where they divide metals from nonmetals and in whether they recognize an intermediate metalloid category. Some authors count metalloids as nonmetals with weakly nonmetallic properties. Others count some of the metalloids as post-transition metals. =Details= Anomalous properties Within each category, elements can be found with one or two properties very different from the expected norm, or that are otherwise notable. =Metals= Sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, barium, platinum, gold :*The common notions that \\"alkali metal ions (group 1A) always have a +1 charge\\"Brown et al. 2009, p. 137 and that \\"transition elements do not form anions\\"Bresica et al. 1975, p. 137 are textbook errors. The synthesis of a crystalline salt of the sodium anion Na‚àí was reported in 1974. Since then further compounds (\\"alkalides\\") containing anions of all other alkali metals except Li and Fr, as well as that of Ba, have been prepared. In 1943, Sommer reported the preparation of the yellow transparent compound CsAu. This was subsequently shown to consist of caesium cations (Cs+) and auride anions (Au‚àí) although it was some years before this conclusion was accepted. Several other aurides (KAu, RbAu) have since been synthesized, as well as the red transparent compound Cs2Pt which was found to contain Cs+ and Pt2‚àí ions.Jansen 2005 Manganese :*Well-behaved metals have crystal structures featuring unit cells with up to four atoms. Manganese has a complex crystal structure with a 58-atom unit cell, effectively four different atomic radii, and four different coordination numbers (10, 11, 12 and 16). It has been described as resembling \\"a quaternary intermetallic compound with four Mn atom types bonding as if they were different elements.\\"Russell & Lee 2005, p. 246 The half-filled 3d shell of manganese appears to be the cause of the complexity. This confers a large magnetic moment on each atom. Below 727 ¬∞C, a unit cell of 58 spatially diverse atoms represents the energetically lowest way of achieving a zero net magnetic moment.Russell & Lee 2005, p. 244‚Äì5 The crystal structure of manganese makes it a hard and brittle metal, with low electrical and thermal conductivity. At higher temperatures \\"greater lattice vibrations nullify magnetic effects\\" and manganese adopts less complex structures.Donohoe 1982, pp. 191‚Äì196; Russell & Lee 2005, pp. 244‚Äì247 Iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium :*The only elements strongly attracted to magnets are iron, cobalt, and nickel at room temperature, gadolinium just below, and terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, and thulium at ultra cold temperatures (below ‚àí54 ¬∞C, ‚àí185 ¬∞C, ‚àí254 ¬∞C, ‚àí254 ¬∞C, and ‚àí241 ¬∞C respectively).Jackson 2000 Iridium :*The only element encountered with an oxidation state of +9 is iridium, in the [IrO4]+ cation. Other than this, the highest known oxidation state is +8, in Ru, Xe, Os, Ir, and Hs.Stoye 2014 Gold :*The malleability of gold is extraordinary: a fist sized lump can be hammered and separated into one million paper back sized sheets, each 10 nm thick, 1600 times thinner than regular kitchen aluminium foil (0.016 mm thick). Mercury #Bricks and bowling balls will float on the surface of mercury thanks to it having a density 13.5 times that of water. Equally, a solid mercury bowling ball would weigh around 50 pounds and, if it could be kept cold enough, would float on the surface of liquid gold. #The only metal having an ionisation energy higher than some nonmetals (sulfur and selenium) is mercury. #Mercury and its compounds have a reputation for toxicity but on a scale of 1 to 10, dimethylmercury ((CH3)2Hg) (abbr. DMM), a volatile colourless liquid, has been described as a 15. It is so dangerous that scientists have been encouraged to use less toxic mercury compounds wherever possible. In 1997, Karen Wetterhahn, a professor of chemistry specialising in toxic metal exposure, died of mercury poisoning ten months after a few drops of DMM landed on her \\"protective\\" latex gloves. Although Wetterhahn had been following the then published procedures for handling this compound, it passed through her gloves and skin within seconds. It is now known that DMM is exceptionally permeable to (ordinary) gloves, skin and tissues. And its toxicity is such that less than one-tenth of a ml applied to the skin will be seriously toxic.Witt 1991; Endicott 1998 Lead :*The expression, to \\"go down like a lead balloon\\" is anchored in the common view of lead as a dense, heavy metal‚Äîbeing nearly as dense as mercury. However, it is possible to construct a balloon made of lead foil, filled with a helium and air mixture, which will float and be buoyant enough to carry a small load. Bismuth :*Bismuth has the longest half-life of any naturally occurring element; its only primordial isotope, bismuth-209, was found in 2003 to be slightly radioactive, decaying via alpha decay with a half-life more than a billion times the estimated age of the universe. Prior to this discovery, bismuth-209 was thought to be the heaviest naturally occurring stable isotope;Dum√© 2003 this distinction now belongs to lead-208. Uranium :*The only element with a naturally occurring isotope capable of undergoing nuclear fission is uranium.Benedict et al. 1946, p. 19 The capacity of uranium-235 to undergo fission was first suggested (and ignored) in 1934, and subsequently discovered in 1938. Plutonium :*It is a commonly held belief that metals reduce their electrical conductivity when heated. Plutonium increases its electrical conductivity when heated in the temperature range of around ‚Äì175 to +125 ¬∞C. =Metalloids= Boron :*Boron is the only element with a partially disordered structure in its most thermodynamically stable crystalline form.Dalhouse University 2015; White et al. 2015 Boron, antimony :*These elements are record holders within the field of superacid chemistry. For seven decades, fluorosulfonic acid HSO3F and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid CF3SO3H were the strongest known acids that could be isolated as single compounds. Both are about a thousand times more acidic than pure sulfuric acid. In 2004, a boron compound broke this record by a thousand fold with the synthesis of carborane acid H(CHB11Cl11). Another metalloid, antimony, features in the strongest known acid, a mixture 10 billion times stronger than carborane acid. This is fluoroantimonic acid H2F[SbF6], a mixture of antimony pentafluoride SbF5 and hydrofluoric acid HF. Silicon #The thermal conductivity of silicon is better than that of most metals. #A sponge-like porous form of silicon (p-Si) is typically prepared by the electrochemical etching of silicon wafers in a hydrofluoric acid solution.DuPlessis 2007, p. 133 Flakes of p-Si sometimes appear red;G√∂sele & Lehmann 1994, p. 19 it has a band gap of 1.97‚Äì2.1 eV.Chen, Lee & Bosman 1994 The many tiny pores in porous silicon give it an enormous internal surface area, up to 1,000 m2/cm3.Kovalev et al. 2001, p. 068301-1 When exposed to an oxidant,Mikulec, Kirtland & Sailor 2002 especially a liquid oxidant, the high surface-area to volume ratio of p-Si creates a very efficient burn, accompanied by nano-explosions, and sometimes by ball-lightning-like plasmoids with, for example, a diameter of 0.1‚Äì0.8 m, a velocity of up to 0.5 m/s and a lifetime of up to 1s.Bychkov 2012, pp. 20‚Äì21; see also Lazaruk et al. 2007 The first ever spectrographic analysis of a ball lightning event (in 2012) revealed the presence of silicon, iron and calcium, these elements also being present in the soil.Slezak 2014 Arsenic :*Metals are said to be fusible, resulting in some confusion in old chemistry as to whether arsenic was a true metal, or a nonmetal, or something in between. It sublimes rather than melts at standard atmospheric pressure, like the nonmetals carbon and red phosphorus. Antimony :*A high-energy explosive form of antimony was first obtained in 1858. It is prepared by the electrolysis of any of the heavier antimony trihalides (SbCl3, SbBr3, SbI3) in a hydrochloric acid solution at low temperature. It comprises amorphous antimony with some occluded antimony trihalide (7‚Äì20% in the case of the trichloride). When scratched, struck, powdered or heated quickly to 200 ¬∞C, it \\"flares up, emits sparks and is converted explosively into the lower-energy, crystalline grey antimony.\\"Wiberg 2001, p. 758; see also Fraden 1951 =Nonmetals= Hydrogen #Water (H2O), a well known oxide of hydrogen, is a spectacular anomaly.Sacks 2001, p. 204 Extrapolating from the heavier hydrogen chalcogenides, namely hydrogen sulfide H2S, hydrogen selenide H2Se, and hydrogen telluride H2Te, water should be \\"a foul-smelling, poisonous, inflammable gas‚Ä¶condensing to a nasty liquid [at] around ‚Äì100¬∞ C\\". Instead, due to hydrogen bonding, water is \\"stable, potable, odorless, benign, and‚Ä¶indispensable to life\\".Sacks 2001, pp. 204‚Äì205 #Less well known of the oxides of hydrogen is the trioxide, H2O3. Berthelot proposed the existence of this oxide in 1880 but his suggestion was soon forgotten as there was no way of testing it using the technology of the time.Cerkovnik & Plesniƒçar 2013, p. 7930 Hydrogen trioxide was prepared in 1994 by replacing the oxygen used in the industrial process for making hydrogen peroxide, with ozone. The yield is about 40 per cent, at ‚Äì78 ¬∞C; above around ‚Äì40 ¬∞C it decomposes into water and oxygen.Emsley 1994, p. 1910 Derivatives of hydrogen trioxide, such as (\\"bis(trifluoromethyl) trioxide\\") are known; these are metastable at room temperature. Mendeleev went a step further, in 1895, and proposed the existence of hydrogen tetroxide as a transient intermediate in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide; this was prepared and characterised in 1974, using a matrix isolation technique. Alkali metal ozonide salts of the unknown hydrogen ozonide (HO3) are also known; these have the formula MO3.Wiberg 2001, p. 497 Helium #At temperatures below 0.3 and 0.8 K respectively, helium-3 and helium-4 each have a negative enthalpy of fusion. This means that, at the appropriate constant pressures, these substances freeze with the addition of heat. #Until 1999 helium was thought to be too small to form a cage clathrate‚Äîa compound in which a guest atom or molecule is encapsulated in a cage formed by a host molecule‚Äîat atmospheric pressure. In that year the synthesis of microgram quantities of He@C20H20 represented the first such helium clathrate and (what was described as) the world's smallest helium balloon.Cross, Saunders & Prinzbach; Chemistry Views 2015 Carbon #Graphite is the most electrically conductive nonmetal, better than some metals. #Diamond is the best natural conductor of heat; it even feels cold to the touch. Its thermal conductivity (2,200 W/m‚Ä¢K) is five times greater than the most conductive metal (Ag at 429); 300 times higher than the least conductive metal (Pu at 6.74); and nearly 4,000 times that of water (0.58) and 100,000 times that of air (0.0224). This high thermal conductivity is used by jewelers and gemologists to separate diamonds from imitations. #Graphene aerogel, produced in 2012 by freeze-drying a solution of carbon nanotubes and graphite oxide sheets and chemically removing oxygen, is seven times lighter than air, and ten per cent lighter than helium. It is the lightest solid known (0.16 mg/cm3), conductive and elastic.Sun, Xu & Gao 2013; Anthony 2013 Phosphorus :*The least stable and most reactive form of phosphorus is the white allotrope. It is a hazardous, highly flammable and toxic substance, spontaneously igniting in air and producing phosphoric acid residue. It is therefore normally stored under water. White phosphorus is also the most common, industrially important, and easily reproducible allotrope, and for these reasons is regarded as the standard state of phosphorus. The most stable form is the black allotrope, which is a metallic looking, brittle and relatively non-reactive semiconductor (unlike the white allotrope, which has a white or yellowish appearance, is pliable, highly reactive and a semiconductor). When assessing periodicity in the physical properties of the elements it needs to be borne in mind that the quoted properties of phosphorus tend to be those of its least stable form rather than, as is the case with all other elements, the most stable form. Iodine :*The mildest of the halogens, iodine is the active ingredient in tincture of iodine, a disinfectant. This can be found in household medicine cabinets or emergency survival kits. Tincture of iodine will rapidly dissolve gold,Nakao 1992 a task ordinarily requiring the use of aqua regia (a highly corrosive mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids).

FRS, MRIA, (1771 in York, England ‚Äì 27 August 1847 in Margate, England) was an English antiquary and librarian. In 1806, he became a candidate for the office of Secretary to the Society of Antiquaries, which he obtained the following year. In 1812, he became an Assistant Librarian of the Royal Library; he went on to accompany that collection to the British Museum, which he attended two days each week. He wrote several topographical dictionaries of England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland. He also wrote an historical account of Charitable Commissioners, and of Foreign Orders of Knighthood. Carlisle traced his descent from John Carlisle (d. 1670), of Witton-le-Wear. He was the son of Thomas Carlisle. His father married, first, Elizabeth Hutchinson; they had at least one child, a son, the surgeon, Anthony Carlisle. Thomas married secondly Susanna Skottowe, who was Nicholas' mother. Nicholas was born in York, where he was baptized in the St Mary Bishophill Junior, York on 8 February 1771. He received his education from the Rev. James Lawson at West Witton. Carlisle entered the naval service of the East India Company, attaining the post of purser. He also went into private business and made a large sum of money. He was appointed Doctor of Civil Law.

The leaves are dark green on the upper side and paler on the underside, ovate to rounded or oblong, long, wide and have a petiole about long. The leaves are arranged alternately, simple, smooth or with sparse hairs, stipules narrow to egg-shaped, long. The stems are flattened toward the apex and either smooth or with short flattened or spreading hairs. The flowers are single or in pairs, long, have orange-yellow standards, that are pinkish brown on the back, and purple-brown keels. The pedicels long, bracts long. The seed pods are oblong in shape and between long. Flowering occurs between September and November in its native range. It is similar to the species Bossiaea buxifolia, but may be distinguished by its longer leaves, petioles and pedicels and more distant leaf spacing. Taxonomy and naming Bossiaea prostrata was first formally described in 1812 by botanist Robert Brown and the description was published in Hortus Kewensis.

She was at times in her life an anarchist propagandist, a revolutionary syndicalist, an anti-militarist, an ardent pro- war militant, an early supporter of the fascist movement in Italy, an anti- fascist, and a monarchist. Biography Rygier was a follower of Arturo Labriola and the socialist avant-garde in Italy. In 1907 she became editor of the newspaper Lotta di classe, a socialist revolutionary publon. With Filippo Corridoni, she also founded the anti-militarist broadsheet Rompete le file. She voiced the opinion that women should oppose militarism, as they gave birth to the soldiers killed in war on behalf of the state. In 1908, she was sentenced to prison for publishing an article endorsing regicide in Rompete le file. In 1909, she began to support anarchism in Italy. She became active in contributing to La Demolizione of the syndicalist Ottavio Dinale from 1907 to 1911. She was sentenced to prison again in 1912 for writing an article in defense of an anarchist soldier, Auguste Masetti, who had shot an officer during the Italian invasion of Libya in 1911. The article appeared in the anarchist journal she co-edited in Bologna, L'Agitatore. As fervent of an anti-militarist she had been even in 1912, two years later she was just as fervent of a World War I interventionist in 1914, she became an editor at the newspaper founded by Benito Mussolini, Il Popolo d'Italia. The fascist daily founded by Mussolini was devoted to supporting the campaign for intervention by Italy in the War. As a syndicalist and union supporter, she was jailed for a period in 1914. Her status as a political prisoner fighting for syndicalism became known to Italian-American syndicalists during the period. Anarchist Leda Rafanelli urged Italian workers to follow the example of Rygier. After a brief nationalist period, she fled to France in 1926, by then in open opposition to Fascism. While in France, Rygier published a pamphlet highly critical of Mussolini. The 16-page pamphlet was originally written in French. The pamphlet was translated and published worldwide in 1928, revealing how Rygier became disillusioned with Mussolini, accusing him of being an informer, engaging in blackmail, and of using tactics harmful to Italy's national interests yet beneficial to its future allies. She further accused Mussolini of political opportunism to further his personal interests, such as taking a lucrative newspaper job that required switching political orientation: Little is known of Rygier's activities after the publication of her anti-Fascist pamphlet in France and the end of World War II. She returned to Italy after the end of World War II. In 1946, she wrote a polemic book on the exiled anti- Fascists (Rivelazioni sul fuoruscitismo italiano in Francia, Rome, 1946). She eventually became a supporter of the monarchy of Italy. She died in Rome in 1953. References  Bibliography  * Sulla soglia di un'epoca.

The Finnish philosopher Jaakko Hintikka calls the work a monumental study and a classic in its field, but notes that it is now antiquated.Hintikka 2005. p. 303. Summary In the book, Westermarck defined marriage as \\"a more or less durable connection between male and female lasting beyond the mere act of propagation till after the birth of the offspring.\\" Westermarck argues that marriage is a social institution that rests on a biological foundation, and developed through a process in which human males came to live together with human females for sexual gratification, companionship, mutual economic aid, procreation, and the joint rearing of offspring.Blankenhorn 2007. p. 37. Besides other observations and propositions, Westermarck also proposes that people who live in close domestic proximity during the first few years of their lives become desensitized to sexual attraction, and as one explanation for the incest taboo. This hypothesis has come to be known as the Westermarck effect, named after him, or as reverse sexual imprinting. Scholarly reception David Blankenhorn calls the book one of the best histories of human marriage, and considers it deservedly famous. He comments, however, that it leaves out a great deal of material while \\"skimming too quickly over too much.\\" Blankenhorn believes, however, that scholarship subsequent to Westermarck's has tended to support his conclusions.

The highway is maintained by Rijkswaterstaat.  Route description  * in Amsterdam * in Diemen * in Muiderberg * near Hilversum * in Amersfoort  History  The route that E 231 follows was originally called E 35 in 1950 in the Declaration on the Construction of Main International Traffic Arteries. That route started in Amsterdam, passed by Amersfoort, E 231's current eastern terminus, Groningen and Bremen, and ended in Hamburg. In the 1950 version of that declaration, there were no routes numbered E 230 and E 231 yet. In 1975, E 230, a new route in the system, was defined and proposed as a road between Amsterdam and Amersfoort, the same route as it follows today. The 1975 version of E 231 followed today's E 232's route from Amersfoort to Groningen. E 35 was also laid down on a new course, running from Hoek van Holland, passing by Rotterdam, Utrecht, Oberhausen, Cologne, and Basel, to Rome. These plans were put into force on 15 March 1983. In 1987, E 230, defined in 1975, was renumbered to E 231. E 231 was renumbered to E 232. E 35 was also rerouted again, now starting in Amsterdam, but following the same route once arrived in Utrecht. In 1950, when E 35 was proposed, much of the underlying road wasn't constructed yet. The first part of the motorway to be completed was the Merwedebrug in 1933, now replaced with the Muiderbrug, with only one lane in each direction. Before 1942, construction started on embankments from Baarn to Amersfoort, but construction was discontinued due to World War II. In 1948 planning was continued and in 1952 Rijksweg 1, now also known as A1, was opened between Baarn and E 231's current eastern terminus Hoevelaken, which was merely a roundabout back then, compared to the cloverleaf interchange that is located there now. That part of the road had one lane in each direction and at grade intersections, but was already upgraded to have grade separated intersections in 1953.

Summary Westermarck, in the preface to The Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas, describes the background to his work. Having concluded that there is a close connection between moral opinions and religious beliefs, he decided to acquire first-hand knowledge of the folklore of a non-European people, and to that end spent four years in Morocco collecting anthropological data, familiarizing himself with the native way of thinking, and gaining an understanding of local customs. He was also indebted to British science and thought.Westermarck 1906. p. v. In his introduction, Westermarck asks why different cultures have different moral views.Westermarck 1906. p. 1. Throughout the book, he attacks the idea that moral principles express objective value. Reception Wainwright Churchill criticizes Westermarck's claim that the Greeks of the Homeric era were unaware of or repudiated pederasty, citing the contrary view of classical scholar Hans Licht.Churchill 1967. p. 126.

Halperin writes in One Hundred Years of Homosexuality (1990) that Westermarck's book formed part of a trend to interpret Greek sexual conventions in an anthropological and ethological context, an approach that contrasts with earlier scholarly studies that proceeded from the assumption that classical Greek society was virtually unique in its acceptance of pederasty.Halperin 1990. pp. 54, 158, 170.

The work is hosted at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. The source of the subject matter is Jerry Grandenetti's panels from \\"Wingmate of Doom,\\" in All American Men of War, no. 90 (March‚ÄìApril 1962), DC Comics. Detail The source for As I Opened Fire was All American Men of War#90 (b) (March‚ÄìApril 1962). Measuring 170 cm √ó 430 cm (68 in √ó 168 in), As I Opened Fire is a triptych with verbal and temporal continuity. In 1972, it was regarded as \\"...perhaps Lichtenstein's most ambitious exercise in strangely uniting, visually (as well as figuratively) warring elements.\\" Depicting a short few seconds during an aircraft battle, the painting is based on three panels of the original narrative which Lichtenstein has altered to improve its formal coherence. This piece represents his affinity toward the high school \\"...highly emotional content, yet detached impersonal handling...\\" As I Opened Fire exhibits Lichtenstein's \\"formal imagination\\". We see successive tighter views of the gun muzzles in action accompanied by an onomatopoeia, which provides cinematic flow despite the varying skies. As I Opened Fire is regarded as a \\"very uncompromising military triptych\\". Lichtenstein desired his paintings to look as mechanical as possible despite being painted by hand. He chose as his subjects teen and action comics because he valued the impersonal quality of their artwork, the products of teams of illustrators. The similarities to the original source are extensive: narrative text and general message of the gunfire. However, he made the joint image more coherent by repositioning the second and third panels for better alignment. Along with Whaam! (the other of his monumental war paintings), this is regarded as the culmination of the dramatic war-comic works of Lichtenstein. Compared with Whaam!, As I Opened Fire is more abstract. Lichtenstein commented on his war imagery: \\"A minor purpose of my war paintings is to put military aggressiveness in an absurd light. My personal opinion is that much of our foreign policy has been unbelievably terrifying, but this is not what my work is about and I don't want to capitalize on this popular position. My work is more about our American definition of images and visual communication.\\" Lichtenstein's alterations from the original source change the uniform perspective of the images, causing it to flow \\"like a series of movie clips\\". The work is considered relatively lacking in unity of its narrative progression. The narrative of the first frame seems unrelated to its graphics and the other frames are equally confusing: It is not clear which frames represent an enemy or an ally, or whether the speaker is the enemy, an ally or the viewer. In general the work is misleading in \\"spatial, temporal and psychological viewpoint\\".

It is a quotation of Erle Loran's diagram of one of Paul C√©zanne's 27 portraits of his wife Marie-Hortense Fiquet, now in the Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia. It was one of the works exhibited at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition in Los Angeles. The work became controversial in that it led to a reconsideration of what constitutes art. Lichtenstein and Loran sparred in the press, and art critics were intrigued by the viewpoints of the two. Loran's view was that Lichtenstein had plagiarized his work, and at one point filed suit. Lichtenstein felt that he was making a statement with his painting on the ridiculous attempt by Loran to explain C√©zanne by diagram. The press frequently used the word transformation when crediting Lichtenstein's work, but Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with that word. Background Portrait of Madame C√©zanne was exhibited along with works such as Man with Folded Arms at Lichtentein's first Pop exhibition in Los Angeles. The linear twice-removed black-and-white (along with Man with Folded Arms) is regarded as a quotation of Erle Loran's outline diagram of C√©zanne's compositional methods published in a diagram book called C√©zanne's Composition. The book was popular in the academic community. Loran's representation in a \\"harsh black outline\\" depicted the axes of the composition without representing the \\"texture and expressiveness of C√©zanne's original.\\" In fact, Loran stated that \\"this diagrammatic approach may seem coldly analytical to those who like vagueness and poetry in art criticism.\\" Loran's diagrammatic techniques were standard at the time; redrawn outlines of the figure were illustrated with alphabetized arrows to identify areas and directions. The diagram highlighted body part positioning without studying the painted surface. According to John Coplans's Roy Lichtenstein, the artist was fascinated by the drawings: \\"isolating the woman out of the context of the painting seemed to Lichtenstein to be such an oversimplification of a complex issue as to be ironical in itself\\"; the oversimplification referred to was Loran's representing C√©zanne's work with nothing more than black lines. The work marked the first of Lichtenstein's \\"artistic appropriations of the canonical works of Modernism\\" that resulted from his realization of the interrelation \\"between avant-garde and kitsch\\". Description Lichtenstein in 1967 The two images garnered attention among critics by highlighting the nuances between copying and creating art, between real and fake art. As Andy Warhol challenged the status quo by \\"humanizing mass-produced product\\", Lichtenstein dehumanized masterpieces. This demonstrates \\"that the quotation of popular culture was not the sign of intelligence suspended but rather the shape of thought.\\" The publication of this work was considered by some observers as more sacrilegious than Duchamp's revisions to the Mona Lisa. Loran wrote two hot-tempered letters in response. In September 1963 issues of ARTnews and Artforum, His articles were written after Lichtenstein's first Pop exhibition in Los Angeles, which featured the two life-sized works depicting Loran's images. Loran, whose text was by this time over twenty years old, even attempted to sue Lichtenstein. According to David Deitcher, \\"The angrier of the two tracts appeared in Art News, where Loran openly expressed his contempt for Lichtenstein's work and hinted at his desire to sue.\\": One critic noted that although Loran was making instructive points with his diagram, Lichtenstein's was an artistic statement. However, Loran was joined by Brian O'Doherty, a critic with The New York Times, in ridiculing the defense of Pop art as transformative rather than appropriationist art. In 1963, O'Doherty wrote his belief that Lichtenstein's work was not art in The New York Times saying, he was \\"one of the worst artists in America\\" who \\"briskly went about making a sow's ear out of a sow's ear.\\" Loran felt Pop art paled in comparison to the aesthetics of Abstract Expressionism. Lichtenstein did not accept the transformation defense. Other critics got involved in the matter, with Gene Swenson querying Lichtenstein \\"about the charges of antagonistic critics 'that Pop Art does not transform its models.\\" Lichtenstein responded that art forms but does not transform. Max Kozloff opined that Loran was being mocked and that while Lichtenstein's product had didactic content, its purpose and need was questionable. Kozloff worried in The Nation that Lichtenstein's work may lead to the values that modern art held being rejected moving forward. The painting is regarded as \\"another of his comments on the way in which we view art.\\" The work, along with his Femme au Chapeau from 1962 mark the beginnings of Lichtenstein's presentations of art about art because it was among his first paintings that drew upon a predecessor artist. Lichtenstein noted his objection to the attempt to reduce art diagrammatically: \\"I wasn't trying to berate Erle Loran ... but it is such an oversimplification trying to explain a painting by A, B, C.\\" He also noted that \\"The C√©zanne is such a complex painting. Taking an outline and calling it Madame C√©zanne is in itself humorous, particularly the idea of diagramming a C√©zanne when C√©zanne said, '... the outline escaped me.'\\"Waldman, p. 37. Lichtenstein obtained legal validation that his work was original when Loran's lawsuit was dismissed, clearing the way for artists to elaborate on images produced by others.

It is part of the Brushstrokes series of artworks that includes several paintings and sculptures. It is located at the Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt, Germany. As with all of his Brushstrokes works, it is in part a satirical response to the gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism. It is in the collection of the Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst.. Background The source for the entire Brushstrokes series was Charlton Comics' Strange Suspense Stories \\"The Painting\\" #72 (October 1964) by Dick Giordano. Yellow and Green Brushstrokes is located at the Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt, Germany. The museum acquired the work from the collection of Karl Str√∂her in 1981. The source for the entire Brushstrokes series was Charlton Comics' Strange Suspense Stories 72 (October 1964) by Dick Giordano. According to the Lichtenstein Foundation, Lichtenstein produced two distinct 1966 oil and Magna on canvases by the title Yellow and Green Brushstrokes. The second one is smaller at 36 x 68 inches (91.4 x 172.7 cm). It involved much straighter brushstrokes. The painting depicts two brushstrokes magnified to cover the entire vast canvas. This is one of several such Brushstrokes series representations that seem \\"absurd\\". Details Measuring 213.4 cm √ó 457.2 cm (84 in √ó 180 in), Yellow and Green Brushstrokes is regarded as quite notable for its ability to imply perceptible movement although his works is limited to a single image on a canvas with finite space. The movement is considered similar to the explosive actions evident in earlier works such as Whaam! and As I Opened Fire. He uses overlapping forms rather than a single form or distinct adjacent forms, which seems to create a more dynamic feel to the shallow space. However, since Lichtenstein does not use shading or contrast, the monochromatic strokes with just bold black outlines are void of certain elements of depth. Big Painting No. 6 and Yellow and Green Brushstrokes go one step further in terms of canvas size and dynamic activity that was presented earlier in Little Big Painting. At wide, the magnitude of the work is exceptional for Lichtenstein. Edward F. Fry described the work in the October 1969 ARTnews as \\"The heroic brushstroke of Abstract-Expressionism mocked by objective treatment in comic-strip idiom\\". This work is regarded as a rare example of Lichtenstein performing as a \\"virtuoso painter\\" and using \\"bravura technique\\".

The story's protagonist is a man named Rice, who works for a company that obtains natural resources and valuable artifacts from alternate timelines created in the past (whenever one engages in time travel, a new timeline forms, making it impossible to alter the original history). The story centers around hostility from the people in the 18th-century timeline, who are angry about their exploitation and the effective robbery of their resources, land, and artwork; these alternate versions of our ancestors ultimately force the company to evacuate the timeline. Setting The story is set in an alternate version of 1775 CE. =Politics and geography= The American Revolution has occurred, but it was carried out with the support of the company, which used it as an opportunity to establish a puppet government in North America. The French Revolution also occurred, prematurely, but was considerably \\"less messy\\": most aristocrats were either made to live normal lives or put to slave labor rather than guillotined, and parts of the monarchy's family were allowed to remain in the Palace of Versailles. (Louis XVI has happily become a full-time locksmith.) Due to the activities of the company (possibly global warming caused by their drilling for and use of fossil fuels), large portions of Florida have become submerged by the ocean. Salzburg, Austria, is the site of a large oil refinery and the main portal between this timeline and \\"Realtime\\". =Culture= Society has been heavily influenced by modern music, morals, and culture. Although individuals from alternate timelines are not generally allowed to immigrate to Realtime (this requires a \\"Green Card\\", which is granted very rarely), the inhabitants want anything that they can get that is modern. Various pieces of technology, and its products, such as electric automobiles, electric guitars, radios, drugs, et cetera have found their way into the alternate timeline, but they are not widely available. Groups of \\"gate people\\" form outside of company complexes begging for technology and medicine from the future. Rock music is broadcast for those with radios by the company's propaganda officer, and a 19-year-old Wolfgang Mozart begins a successful career as a rock star. \\"Quiche-to-go\\" stores have been opened in France, and Napoleon Bonaparte is mentioned \\"chewing Dubble Bubble in Corsica\\". Plot The story is told in third person limited, with a man named Rice as the protagonist. After several years of work establishing the infrastructure to obtain oil and other resources for use in Realtime, he decides to leave the Realtime compounds and tour Salzburg. He quickly encounters a teenaged Mozart, whom he befriends and provides with advice and a job. Mozart invites Rice to a rock concert which he is giving, and Rice attends. After the concert is over, they begin discussing various topics, and Marie Antoinette is mentioned. After Rice tells him that she was decapitated in the original timeline by French revolutionaries, Mozart suggests that Rice go meet her, since he saved her life. At this point, Parker, the propaganda officer, arrives, along with a number of former ladies who are all hoping to seduce him to get a chance to \\"sleep in [his] clean sheets and raid his medicine cabinet\\" although Parker is \\"short, fat, and repulsive\\". Rice decides to meet Marie Antoinette. The narration jumps forward a week, and resumes with them in bed together in Versailles palace after a week of \\"obsessive carnality\\". When she asks him about a leather bikini in an issue of Vogue, he pats her on the rear and tells her that she is with him now and can get what she wants. Rice reveals that he was supposed to have been back to work days ago. When \\"Toinette\\" asks whether he loves her, Rice answers: \\"Baby, I love the very idea of you.\\" At this point, Mozart, who has mysteriously obtained a communications job, calls Rice. He explains that there is serious trouble with native uprisings and that Rice is needed back. Rice and Marie begin to drive back towards Salzburg, and they have an argument because Rice is unable to obtain a Green Card for her. As a result, she lures him into a trap, and several Freemasons (who are coordinating much of the resistance) capture him and take him hostage. After Rice is held captive for several hours in an isolated house, Jebe Noyon, a former Mongol warrior and member of the Grey Card Army (a Grey Card allows one to move between different branches of alternate history, but not enter Realtime), arrives. He uses modern weapons to quickly kill the Masons and rescue Rice. He conveys Rice back to the company's compound, where a battle is taking place between Grey Card soldiers and local troops; the casualty ratio strongly favors the company soldiers, but they are severely outnumbered and have received orders to abandon the timeline. At this point, Marie Antoinette arrives, shouting angrily at Mozart, who had promised that if she led Rice into the trap, he would obtain a Green Card for her. Jebe punches her in the face and knocks her down. From this, Jebe realizes that Mozart had incited the Masons and given them information, and threatens to kill Mozart. Parker, the propaganda officer, casually kills Jebe, explaining that he could not risk anything happening to Mozart, whose music has reached number five on the Billboard charts. Rice becomes angry and shouts at Mozart that he can not use people like that, and that Realtime will punish him when they find out what he did. Parker considers this amusing, saying \\"We're talking Top of the Pops, here. Not some penny-ante refinery.\\" Rice, stunned, grabs \\"Toinette\\" and follows Parker and Mozart through the time portal, abandoning that timeline.The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century.

History Established on July 1, 2012 with a grant of $60 million from the Simons Foundation, the Institute is housed in Calvin Lab, a dedicated building on the Berkeley campus. The Simons Institute brings together the leading researchers in theoretical computer science and related fields, as well as the next generation of outstanding young scholars, to explore deep unsolved problems about the nature and limits of computation. Richard M. Karp was Founding Director of the Institute, and fellow Turing Award winner Shafi Goldwasser took over as Director on January 1, 2018. = Mission = The Institute aims to promote fundamental research on the foundations of computer science, as well as to expand the horizons of the field by exploring other scientific disciplines through a computational lens. This second and distinctive goal is motivated by the fact that natural phenomena in many scientific fields (including mathematics, statistics, physics, astronomy, biology and economics), or the models those fields have developed for these phenomena, are intrinsically computational in nature‚Äîfrom chemical processes in living cells to the self-organizing behavior of complex systems of interacting particles, to mechanisms governing human evolution and the collective behavior of competing agents in an economy. The insights gained from such explorations often reflect back to the theory of computation, opening new directions and advancing our understanding of fundamental issues in complexity theory and algorithms. = Activities = The Institute's core activities revolve around a rotating sequence of programs; a program typically runs for one semester, and there will usually be two concurrent programs each semester. Run by a small group of organizers, a program typically includes 60-70 long-term participants (a mix of senior and junior researchers), with additional short-term visitors attending workshops during the semester. Junior participants are supported by the Fellowships program. Program topics are intended to span all areas of theoretical computer science, as well as its connections to other scientific disciplines; the Institute particularly aims to identify programs that can potentially lead to substantial advances in the field, rather than promoting \\"business as usual\\". Proposals for programs are solicited from the worldwide theoretical computer science community and may be submitted at any time. Proposals are reviewed by the Institute's Scientific Advisory Board, which meets twice a year. Proposal selection normally occurs approximately 2 years in advance of the start of a program.

It was there that he described first reading newspaper accounts of the Galapagos Islands and the disappearance of Colonel Percy Fawcett, the British explorer, in the jungles of Brazil. \\"The Sunday supplements had stories about whether or not he had become a white god there,\\" McIntyre remembered in 1991, then in his 70s.http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19911015&slug;=1311092 McIntyre attended Seattle's Cleveland High School, and later graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied Latin American culture. After his studies McIntyre joined the Merchant Marine, and when World War II broke out, he served for four years with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific theater. During his Merchant Marine and Naval careers, McIntyre circumnavigated the globe, visiting countries such as Japan, China, Manchuria, Singapore, India and Brazil. After the war, McIntyre was assigned to the Peruvian Navy as a gunnery adviser, retiring with the rank of Captain. McIntyre attended the Universidad San Marcos in Lima, Peru, where he studied ethnology and became fluent in both Spanish and Portuguese. Photojournalism In the late 1950s and 1960s, while working for the US AID program in Peru and Bolivia, McIntyre began photographing his travels. His first article as a freelance photographer and writer was \\"Flamboyant Is the Word for Bolivia,\\" published in National Geographic in 1966.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go2043/is_5_55/ai_n9194501/ The article featured 47 of McIntyre's photos.

Discoverer of the furthermost source of the Amazon River In 1971 the National Geographic Society sent a three-man expedition, headed by McIntyre, to locate the precise headwaters of the Amazon river. It was the brook named Carhuasanta located in the Apur√≠mac Region of Peru, fed by the winter snows of the mountain Mismi (5,597 m), some 6,400 kilometers from the Atlantic Ocean. Of all the possible river sources in the Amazon Basin, it is the snow melt of the Carhuasanta that has been calculated by cartographers to be the furthermost water source from the mouth of the Amazon. The expedition traveled from the mining town of Cailloma by four-wheel drive, then climbed the Apachita Trail and traversed onto Mismi, taking in Kiwicha and Puma Chiri. This is, as McIntyre describes it in his 1972 National Geographic article, \\"a semicircle rampart of the continental divide. All that trickles from the inner rim joins to form the Apurimac.\\"MacIntyre, L. \\"Amazon: The River Sea,\\" National Geographic Magazine, October 1972 > \\"On October 15, 1971, we reached an ice-edged ridge above Carhuasanta, > longest of the five head-water brooks.

However, the source changes continuously over time because of shifts of the weather and its impact on the countless micro-climates of the region. In the wet season the mountains and altiplano are covered in snow; in the dry season it resembles a desert. Personal life McIntyre lived with his wife Sue for many years in South America, primarily Peru. Together they raised two sons, Scott and Lance. At the end of his life, he lived in Arlington, Virginia and worked primarily in Brazil. He died in Arlington in 2003. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and two grandchildren. https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/plus/lost-and-found/amazon- encounter-explorer-photographer/ https://medicine.llu.edu/chdmm/about/faculty/zaida-cordero-macintyre-phd Bibliography * The Incredible Incas and Their Timeless Land (1975) * Exploring South America (1990) * Amazonia (1991) * Die Amerikanische Reise (2000) References Category:American male journalists Category:20th-century American journalists Category:American male writers Category:American non- fiction writers Category:20th-century American photographers Category:United States Merchant Mariners Category:Military personnel from Seattle Category:Writers from Seattle Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:1917 births Category:2003 deaths \\\\--------------------------------------------------------------------- https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/plus/lost-and-found/amazon- encounter-explorer-photographer/ \\\\-------------------------------------------------------------------- ","title":"Loren McIntyre"},{"id":"35803617","text":"Solivomer arenidens is a species of blackchin only known from the waters around the Philippines where they are known from around .

Founded in 1884 by William W. Nolen (Harvard, Class of 1884) as Nolen's Tutoring School, the original mission of the school was to tutor Harvard undergraduates to prepare them for mid-term and final examinations. The curriculum expanded in the 1930s to include preparing students for Harvard's entrance exam. Manter Hall eventually evolved into an unorthodox prep school that prepared students who were unable to fit into traditional high schools and prep schools. Manter Hall's most famous alumni were Joseph P. Kennedy II (Class of 1971), a former Congressman, and Tenley Albright ('58), the first American female skater to win an Olympic gold medal. Tutoring Harvard undergrads Tutoring Harvard undergrads was the school's primary mission for fifty years. Located in a building owned by Harvard, the school provided four- and eight-hour cram courses before midterms and final exams. Nolen died in 1924 and the school moved to Manter Hall, changing its name to Manter Hall School, Inc. By 1932, the school was tutoring secondary school students who had failed the Harvard entrance exam. The school also enabled Harvard applicants who were shy a few credits to make up those credits in order to qualify for entrance. During World War II, the school focused on helping aviation cadets pass Harvard's entrance exam. After the war, enrollment swelled to over 250 students, but class size had settled back to 60 by the 1950s. In that decade, it became a standard prep school offering instruction for grades nine through 12 and focused on special needs students. Ownership The school was managed by Robert G. Hall, who eventually became its owner, from 1936 until his death in 1996, after which the school was disbanded. Because of Hall's interest in dyslexia, the school implemented a diagnostic reading test in the 1950s. He created Educator's Publishing Services, which published and distributed academic books. Before his death, Hall came to understand the unique educational opportunities Harvard Student Agencies (HSA) afforded to Harvard undergraduates and decided to sell the property to HSA in the spring of 1996. The building was dedicated as Burke- McCoy Hall on February 5, 1997, and became the permanent home for HSA the Let's Go travel guide series. Student body By 1975, the student body was down to 50. The school had a tradition for graduates by celebrating graduation at the Newton estate of an old classmate of Mr Hall. The celebration ended with the traditional valedictorian speech. Class sizes were from \\"four or five to a maximum of ten or twelve,\\" according to owner Hall in a 1975 Harvard Crimson interview, which enabled teachers to give students special attention. The building‚Äôs ground floor was leased to retail businesses, most notably Elsie‚Äôs delicatessen. Hall said approximately 50% of the student body were remedial students. A good portion of the student body was derived from Cambridge with the rest of the students from surrounding towns. The school had an international presence as well. The school did not advertise but relied on word of mouth. The school was traditionally run but had much focus on the individual children as they moved through the grades. The school did not have the capacity to offer sports or extracurricular activities but was smack in the middle of Harvard Square which provided its own sort of sport. Tenley Albright became the first girl at the school. The school enabled her to take classes scheduled around her training schedule. She went on to become a surgeon and her two daughters attended the school. By 1993, there were only 19 students. The last four seniors graduated in 1996.

Summary Phaedon is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul. It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue Phaedo, in which Socrates argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists. Reception Materialistic views were at the time rampant and fashionable, and faith in immortality was at a low ebb. At this favourable juncture appeared Ph√§don oder √ºber die Unsterblichkeit der Seele (Phaedo or On the Immortality of Souls; 1767). Modelled on Plato's dialogue of the same name, Mendelssohn's work possessed some of the charm of its Greek exemplar and impressed the German world with its beauty and lucidity of style. The Phaedon was an immediate success, and besides being one of the most widely read books of its time in German it was speedily translated into several European languages, including English. The author was hailed as the \\"German Plato,\\" or the \\"German Socrates\\"; royal and other aristocratic friends showered attentions on him, and it was said that \\"no stranger who came to Berlin failed to pay his personal respects to the German Socrates.\\" Immanuel Kant criticized Mendelssohn's argument for immortality in the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787), at B413‚Äì15. Commentators disagree over whether Kant's criticism is successful. Mendelssohn's arguments have been largely overlooked by contemporary analytic philosophers, but philosophers including Bertrand Russell and E.J. Lowe have offered arguments for the simplicity of the soul.

He spent the years 1927‚Äì1932 in Paris creating a social realism, art-deco and primitivism sculptural style. When he returned to the United States, Warneke undertook multiple commissions for the Works Progress Administration. He shared his skills with young art students by teaching sculpture at various institutions. From 1943 to 1968, Warneke taught in Washington, D.C. at the George Washington University and the Corcoran School of Art. Warneke died in Connecticut in 1983.

It involves the preparation and drinking of sencha green tea, especially the high grade gyokuro type.  History  Towards the end of the 17th century in the Edo period, Chinese merchants visiting Nagasaki showed how brewed tea should be drunk, as practised in the Ming dynasty court. This practise of the Chinese tea culture spread in the 18th century until the beginning of the Meiji era, particularly among literati merchants, in the form of friends meeting in a less formal atmosphere than the chanoyu. Appreciation of painting and literacy objects then took on particular importance. These meetings, often followed by genuine meals, were the opportunity to admire the host's collections, most often composed of objects imported from China or made in Japan in Chinese style called karamono. In difference to the preparation of matcha tea, which is powdered, sencha is prepared using small leaf tea. Similarly to the Chinese Gongfu tea ceremony, senchad≈ç has a codified form of preparation, presentation and enjoyment of tea. In spring 2020 the Aichi Prefectural Ceramic Museum in cooperation with Meiji-mura held a large sencha exhibition about Kimura Teizo, an outstanding art collector born in Nagoya. He was already collecting works by at the age of 25 and became patron of the arts. His collection of 3,307 items was donated to the Aichi Prefectural Museum of Art, including modern and contemporary art, Edo period paintings, tea pottery, Buddhist art and archaeological relics.  Utensils  Senchad≈ç uses utensils which are necessary to perform tea. Some of them are used in macha tea as well.

The thick disk is shown in light yellow. The thick disk is one of the structural components of about 2/3 of all disk galaxies, including the Milky Way. It was discovered first in external edge-on galaxies. Soon after, it was proposed as a unique galactic structure in the Milky Way, different from the thin disk and the halo in the 1983 article by Gilmore & Reid. It is supposed to dominate the stellar number density between above the galactic plane and, in the solar neighborhood, is composed almost exclusively of older stars. Its stellar chemistry and stellar kinematics (composition and motion of it stars) are also said to set it apart from the thin disk. Compared to the thin disk, thick disk stars typically have significantly lower levels of metals‚Äîthat is, the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium. The thick disk is a source of early kinematic and chemical evidence for a galaxy's composition and thus is regarded as a very significant component for understanding galaxy formation. With the availability of observations at larger distances away from the Sun, more recently it has become apparent that the Milky Way thick disk does not have the same chemical and age composition at all galactic radii. It was found instead that it is metal poor inside the solar radius, but becomes more metal rich outside it. Additionally, recent observations have revealed that the average stellar age of thick disk stars quickly decreases as one moves from the inner to the outer disk. Origin It was shown that there is a diversity of thick disc formation scenarios . In general, various scenarios for the formation of this structure have been proposed, including: * Thick disks come from the heating of the thin disk * It is a result of a merger event between the Milky Way and a massive dwarf galaxy * More energetic stars migrate outwards from the inner galaxy to form a thick disk at larger radii * The disk forms thick at high redshift with the thin disk forming later * Disk flaring combined with inside-out disk formation Dispute Although the thick disk is mentioned as a bona fide galactic structure in numerous scientific studies and it's even thought to be a common component of disk galaxies in general, its nature is still under dispute. The view of the thick disk as a single separate component has been questioned by a series of papers that describe the galactic disk with a continuous spectrum of components with different thicknesses.

A member organisation of the Organization of Military Museums of Canada, the communications museum was established at the base in 1961 and moved to its current purpose-built building in 1996. Described by Lonely Planet as \\"a comprehensive and well- designed museum offering chronological displays on communications technology and sundry military gadgets\\", the museum traces the development of military communications from 1903 onward, through World War I and II, the Korean War and various NATO and United Nations peacekeeping missions to the modern era of communications satellites.  Exhibits  Canadian soldiers are represented by mannequins in military uniform of the appropriate eras manning fixed communications posts, heavily sandbagged underground dugouts and military vehicles while operating military communications equipment. The history of Canadian electronic military signals dates from 1903, when the militia-based Canadian Signal Corps was established as the first of its kind in the Commonwealth. Exhibits are arranged chronologically from the World War I era to the recent International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan. Artefacts of the Great War include a cable wagon restored by local signallers, a switchboard from the first deployments of telephone communications in directing artillery, Morse code equipment and gas masks which signallers would have had to keep at the ready in the event of chemical attack. The use of encryption, signals intelligence and counterintelligence is also documented, particularly in the World War II era where a break in the Enigma machine cipher by Allied forces would prove to be of decisive strategic value., see also same title and author here. Two of the radar antennas from CFS Ramore were donated to the Military Communications and Electronics Museum in Kingston upon Ramore‚Äôs closure. The museum also displays a complete, working radioamateur station as a gateway in the Canadian Forces Affiliate Radio System (CFARS); the station's callsigns are CIW64 (CFARS), CIW964 (CFARS gateway) and VE3RCS (radioamateur service). A war memorial \\"Canada mourning her fallen sons\\" is part of the museum and incorporates three plaster models created by sculptor Walter Allward during the design of the Vimy Memorial in France.

In addition to Hannibal, the Courier-Post covers several other communities in Marion, Pike, and Ralls Counties, including the cities of Bowling Green, Center, Louisiana, Monroe City, New London, Palmyra, Perry, Saverton, and Vandalia.  History  The newspaper claims to be the oldest daily newspaper in Missouri, having printed daily since 1853 and tracing its lineage back to several weekly newspapers in and around Hannibal: the Commercial Advertiser (1837), later called the Pacific Monitor (1840), Hannibal Journal (1841) and Hannibal Journal and Western Union (1850); the Hannibal Gazette (1846); the Hannibal Messenger (1851); and a Palmyra weekly, the Missouri Courier, founded in 1832 and consolidated with the Gazette in 1848. The Journal converted to a daily March 16, 1853, the Messenger in 1858. The Messenger combined with the Courier in 1863, adopting the name North Missouri Courier. The daily Courier in 1891 merged with the Daily Post, marking the debut of the name Hannibal Courier- Post. The Morning Journal was acquired in 1918. Individual owners had published the Courier-Post and its predecessors since the 1850s, including Thomas B. Morse, who had founded the Daily Post in 1886 and remained publisher of the merged newspaper until 1907. Morse sold the paper that year to Lee Enterprises, which invested heavily in its new acquisition, with a new printing press, Associated Press wire, and a new building. Lee sold the paper to Stauffer Communications in 1969. Morris Communications acquired Stauffer in 1995.Morris Communications buys Stauffer Communications GateHouse Media, purchased the Courier-Post in 2007. Quincy Media, owners of the Quincy Herald- Whig, announced their purchase of the Courier-Post in 2019. =Mark Twain= As the hometown daily newspapers of Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens), the predecessors of the Hannibal Courier-Post were an important part of the future literary star's youth. It was an advertisement in the Commercial Advertiser weekly, from February 27, 1839, that lured Twain's father John Marshall Clemens to Hannibal. Twain himself worked on the Missouri Courier, as a \\"printer's devil\\" in 1849, as he recalled in a 1908 letter to the Courier editors: Twain's older brother, Orion Clemens, briefly owned the Hannibal Journal and Western Union, 1850-1853, employing Twain as a typesetter and contributor of articles and humorous sketches.

It serves the Kirksville and Adair County, Missouri area including the communities of Brashear and Novinger. It is owned by Gannett. History While newspapers in Adair County date back as early as 1856, the Kirksville Daily Express had its beginnings in 1901 when the Kirksville Evening Express was started by N. A. Matlick and J. Orton Rice. In 1906, under the new ownership of C. C. Howard, the name was changed to the Kirksville Daily Express. In November, 1909 Howard sold it to a trio of businessmen led by E. E. Swain. Swain soon bought out his two partners and the newspaper would remain in the Swain family for the next eight decades. Edward Everett Swain, a native of Ewing, Illinois had considerable newspaper experience before coming to Kirksville. He previously worked for major publications in Rochester, New York as well as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, St. Louis Globe-Democrat and the Associated Press. Longtime publisher E.E. Swain Early notable events in the newspapers' history include joining the United Press Association in 1915 and the coming of news via teletypewriter in 1928. After working out of a number of rented building spaces for the first several years, in 1930 E. E. Swain constructed an art deco style building in downtown Kirksville. It, along with an addition constructed in 1964 to house an offset printer, continues to serve as the Express offices. Following Swain's death in 1972 ownership and operation of the newspaper passed to his son E. E. Swain, Jr. In 1990 the Daily Express was sold to American Publishing Company, although a Swain, E. E.'s grandson Tony, still remained as pressroom supervisor. Gatehouse Media (formerly Liberty Media Group) assumed operation of the newspaper in 1998. Faced with an aging offset press needing upgrade and growing consolidation in the newspaper industry, the decision was made in December, 2010 to shift printing of the Kirksville Daily Express to a sister Gatehouse Media operation in Hannibal, Missouri. Other than printing however all operations remain in Kirksville. References * A Book of Adair County History.

Dinah shows up minutes later, having heard that Jani intends to marry his new assistant, Irene (Trudy Marshall). Dinah has come to make sure she gets her half of the loot. In a scuffle, she grazes Jani's right hand with a gunshot before fleeing. Blackie arranges to impersonate Jani, while the magician hides in Blackie's absent friend's apartment. That night, Blackie is awoken by sounds in Jani's apartment. When he investigates, a woman runs out of the unlit room. Blackie eventually locates the money in Jani's safety deposit box and takes it, still disguised as Jani. Outside, Dinah forces him at gunpoint to give her the envelope containing the loot, but when she opens it, it is empty. Blackie had taken the precaution of pocketing the money. In the meantime, Blackie's friend returns home from a trip early and finds Jani's body in the closet. Farraday corners and arrests Blackie and his sidekick, \\"the Runt\\" (George E. Stone), for murder. Blackie easily escapes from his cell. Returning to the theatre where Jani performed, he finds an armed Irene over Dinah's lifeless body. She admits she herself was after the money all along. She makes Blackie hand it over, before calling the police. When Farraday and his dimwitted assistant, Sergeant Matthews (Frank Sully), arrive, Blackie tells them he recorded Irene's confession when he turned on the radio for some music. When he plays it for them, Irene tries to run, but is caught and taken away. Blackie then informs Farraday that there was no recording; he merely used ventriloquism to reenact his part of the prior conversation to fool Irene.

It is the levorotatory enantiomer of fenfluramine, the racemic form of the compound, whereas the dextrorotatory enantiomer is dexfenfluramine. Both fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine are anorectic agents that have been used clinically in the treatment of obesity (and hence, levofenfluramine has been as well since it is a component of fenfluramine). However, they have since been discontinued due to reports of causing cardiovascular conditions such as valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension, adverse effects that are likely to be caused by excessive stimulation of 5-HT2B receptors expressed on heart valves. Dexfenfluramine is believed to be solely responsible for the appetite suppressant properties of fenfluramine, of which it has been demonstrated to mediate predominantly via activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors through a combination of indirect serotonin releasing agent and direct serotonin receptor agonist activities (the latter of which are mediated fully by its active metabolite dexnorfenfluramine). Contrarily, levofenfluramine is thought to contribute only to unwanted side effects. Paradoxically, however, it has been shown that levofenfluramine too acts as a relatively potent releaser of serotonin, though with approximately 1/3rd of the efficacy of dexfenfluramine, As such, it would be expected to possess some degree of appetite suppressant properties as well, yet it does not. A potential explanation as to why levofenfluramine is not similarly an effective anorectic is that it has also been found to behave as a dopamine receptor antagonist, which, as dopamine antagonists like atypical antipsychotics are associated with causing increased appetite and weight gain‚Äîeffects that their actions on dopamine receptors have been implicated in playing a role in the development of, is an action that could in theory cancel out the hypothetical serotonergically-mediated appetite suppressant effects of the compound. However, this is speculation and has not been proven. Levonorfenfluramine, an active metabolite of levofenfluramine, is also a fairly potent serotonin releasing agent (with a potency of approximately 1/2 that of norfenfluramine and 1/6th that of dexfenfluramine) and, similarly to dexnorfenfluramine, is a 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor agonist, as well as a somewhat less potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (about 1/2 that of its efficacy as a serotonin releaser). As such, likely contributes significantly to the biological activity‚Äîthough not necessarily appetite suppressant effects‚Äîof not only levofenfluramine but of racemic fenfluramine as well. In contrast to levonorfenfluramine, levofenfluramine is virtually inactive as a reuptake inhibitor or releaser of norepinephrine, and neither compound has any effect on dopamine reuptake or release.

It is one of several vintage movie theatres in Montreal whose fa√ßade and interior have retained their original appearance. It is mostly used for musical performances and live events. History The theatre was built in 1912 for silent film. Originally known as the Family Theatre, it was designed by architects Joseph-Cajetan Dufort and Louis-Joseph-Th√©ophile D√©cary for the Duchess Amusement Company; which owned the theatre until 1923, when it was sold to the United Amusements Corporation. With the sale, the theatre acquired the current name, and was modified by architect Daniel John Crighton and theatre decorator Emmanuel Briffa. The original glass and metal marquee were also replaced by a cast-iron design by Crighton in 1938. It was acquired by the city of Montreal in 1967 and then rented to the Noiseux Plumbing Supply Co., which used the hall as storage. In the 1980s it was a filming location for films by Andr√© Forcier and Jean Beaudin. It was re-opened briefly in the summer of 1987 by Les Petites Filles aux Allumettes for performances of hybrid theatre and visual arts. It was acquired by the nonprofit \\"Institut des arts de la sc√®ne\\" in October 1997 and was renovated and reopened in 1998. Its facade was restored in 2004. The interior of the theatre suffered C$50,000 of damage following an electrical fire in March 2007. In December 2012, the theatre was acquired by Virgin Mobile in partnership with Evenko, and the latter is now the property manager.

Sagoff endorsed Sandel's \\"criticism of contemporary utilitarian and Kantian conceptions of the good\\". He expressed agreement with Sandel's views of liberalism and the nature of the self. He also agreed with Sandel's criticisms of Rawls's view of the origins of the principles of justice and of \\"the idea of a social contract dependent on possessive individualism.\\" He compared Sandel's views to those of the philosophers F. H. Bradley, Thomas Hill Green, and Bernard Bosanquet, but believed that his work was open to criticism in that it did not advance sufficiently beyond them and left some questions unresolved. The philosopher Sheldon Wolin called the book \\"the best political critique of Rawls from a communitarian and participatory perspective.\\" The philosopher Richard Rorty described the book as \\"clear and forceful\\". He credited Sandel with providing \\"very elegant and cogent arguments against the attempt to use a certain conception of the self, a certain metaphysical view of what human beings are like, to legitimize liberal politics.\\" The philosopher Jonathan Wolff wrote that Sandel provides the fullest development of the argument that Rawls bases his political philosophy on an untenable metaphysics of the self. The philosopher Will Kymlicka wrote that Liberalism and the Limits of Justice is Sandel's best-known book, and helped start the liberalism-communitarianism debate that dominated Anglo-American political philosophy in the 1980s.

In May 2008, ESA and NASA established a coordination group involving all three agencies, with the intent of exploring a joint mission merging the ongoing XEUS and Constellation-X projects. This proposed the start of a joint study for IXO. NASA was forced to cancel the observatory due to budget constrains in fiscal year 2012. ESA however decided to reboot the mission on its own developing Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics as a part of Cosmic Vision program.  Science with IXO  X-ray observations are crucial for understanding the structure and evolution of the stars, galaxies, and the Universe as a whole. X-ray images reveal hot spots in the Universe‚Äîregions where particles have been energized or raised to very high temperatures by strong magnetic fields, violent explosions, and intense gravitational forces. X-ray sources in the sky are also associated with the different phases of stellar evolution such as the supernova remnants, neutron stars, and black holes. IXO will explore X-ray Universe and address the following fundamental and timely questions in astrophysics: * What happens close to a black hole? * How did supermassive black holes grow? * How do large scale structures form? * What is the connection between these processes? To address these science questions, IXO will trace orbits close to the event horizon of black holes, measure black hole spin for several hundred active galactic nuclei (AGN), use spectroscopy to characterize outflows and the environment of AGN during their peak activity, search for supermassive black holes out to redshift z = 10, map bulk motions and turbulence in galaxy clusters, find the missing baryons in the cosmic web using background quasars, and observe the process of cosmic feedback where black holes inject energy on galactic and intergalactic scales.\\"Stellar-Mass Black Holes and Their Progenitors\\", J. Miller et al.\\"The Evolution of Galaxy Clusters Across Cosmic Time\\", M. Arnaud et al.\\"The Missing Baryons in the Milky Way and Local Group\\", Joel N. Bregman et al.\\"Cosmic Feedback from Supermassive Black Holes\\", Andrew C. Fabian et al. This will allow astronomers to understand better the history and evolution of matter and energy, visible and dark, as well as their interplay during the formation of the largest structures. Closer to home, IXO observations will constrain the equation of state in neutron stars, black holes spin demographics, when and how elements were created and dispersed into the intergalactic medium, and much more.\\"The Behavior of Matter Under Extreme Conditions\\", F. Paerels et al. \\"Spin and Relativistic Phenomena Around Black Holes\\", L. Brenneman et al.\\"Formation of the Elements\\", John P. Hughes et al. To achieve these science goals, IXO requires extremely large collecting area combined with good angular resolution in order to offer unmatched sensitivities for the study of the high-z Universe and for high-precision spectroscopy of bright X-ray sources. The large collecting area required because, in astronomy, telescopes gather light and produce images by hunting and counting photons. The number of photons collected puts the limit to our knowledge about the size, energy, or mass of an object detected. More photons collected means better images and better spectra, and therefore offers better possibilities for understanding of cosmic processes. IXO configuration The heart of IXO mission is a single large X-ray mirror with up to 3 square meters of collecting area and 5 arcsec angular resolution, which is achieved with an extendable optical bench with a 20 m focal length. Optics IXO - cutaway view. X-ray beams reaching detectors, which will provide complementary spectroscopy, imaging, timing, and polarimetry data on cosmic X-ray sources. A key feature of the IXO mirror design is a single mirror assembly (Flight Mirror Assembly, FMA), which is optimized to minimize mass while maximizing the collecting area, and an extendible optical bench. Unlike visible light, X-rays cannot be focused at normal incidence, since the X-ray beams would be absorbed in the mirror. Instead, IXO's mirrors, like all prior X-ray telescopes, will use grazing incidences, scattering at a very shallow angle. As a result, X-ray telescopes consist of nested cylindrical shells, with their inner surface being the reflecting surface. However, as the goal is to collect as many photons as possible, IXO will have a bigger than 3m diameter mirror. As the grazing angle is a function inversely proportional to photon energy, the higher-energy X-rays require smaller (less than 2 degrees) grazing angles to be focused. This implies longer focal lengths as the photon energy increases, thus making X-ray telescopes difficult to build if focusing of photons with energies higher than a few keV is desired. For that reason IXO features an extendible optical bench that offers a focal length of 20 m. A focal length of 20 meters was selected for IXO as a reasonable balance between scientific needs for advanced photon collecting capability at the higher energy ranges and engineering constraints. Since no payload fairing is large enough to fit a 20-meter long observatory, thus IXO has a deployable metering structure between the spacecraft bus and the instrument module. Instruments NASA conception of IXO, mirror view, artist's impression. IXO scientific goals require gathering many pieces of information using different techniques such as spectroscopy, timing, imaging, and polarimetry. Therefore, IXO will carry a range of detectors, which will provide complementary spectroscopy, imaging, timing, and polarimetry data on cosmic X-ray sources to help disentangle the physical processes occurring in them. Two high-resolution spectrometers, a microcalorimeter (XMS or cryogenic imaging spectrograph (CIS)) and a set of dispersive gratings (XGS) will provide high-quality spectra over the 0.1‚Äì10 keV bandpass where most astrophysically abundant ions have X-ray lines.\\"Uniform high spectral resolution demonstrated in arrays of TES x-ray microcalorimeters\\", Caroline Kilbourne et al., SPIE 2007 The detailed spectroscopy from these instruments will enable high-energy astronomers to learn about the temperature, composition, and velocity of plasmas in the Universe. Moreover, the study of specific X-ray spectral features probes the conditions of matter in extreme gravity field, such as around supermassive black holes. Flux variability adds a further dimension by linking the emission to the size of the emitting region and its evolution over time; the high timing resolution spectrometer (HTRS) on IXO will allow these types of studies in a broad energy range and with high sensitivity.\\"Science with the XEUS High Time Resolution Spectrometer\\", D. Barret, 2008, Proc. SPIE Vol. 7011, 70110E To extend our view of the high-energy Universe to the hard X-rays and find the most obscured black holes, the wide field imaging & hard X-ray imaging detectors (WFI/HXI) together will image the sky up to 18 arcmin field of view (FOV) with a moderate resolution (<150 eV up to 6 keV and <1 keV (FWHM) at 40 keV).Treis, J., et al., 2008, Proc. SPIE Vol. 7021, 70210Z IXO's imaging X-ray polarimeter will be a powerful tool to explore sources such as neutron stars and black holes, measuring their properties and how they impact their surroundings.\\"XPOL: a photoelectric polarimeter onboard XEUS\\", Enrico Costa et al., Proceedings of SPIE Astronomical Instrumentation 2008 Conference, 23‚Äì28 June 2008 Marseille, France, Vol. 7011‚Äì15 The detectors will be located on two instrument platforms‚Äîthe Moveable Instrument Platform (MIP) and the Fixed Instrument Platform (FIP). The Moveable Instrument Platform is needed because an X-ray telescopes cannot be folded as it can be done with visible-spectrum telescopes. Therefore, IXO will use the MIP that holds the following detectors‚Äîa wide field imaging & hard X-ray imaging detector, a high-spectral- resolution imaging spectrometer, a high timing resolution spectrometer, and a polarimeter‚Äîand rotates them into the focus in turn. The X-ray Grating Spectrometer will be located on the Fixed Instrument Platform. This is a wavelength-dispersive spectrometer that will provide high spectral resolution in the soft X-ray band. It can be used to determine the properties of the warm-hot-intergalactic medium, outflows from active galactic nuclei, and plasma emissions from stellar coronae.\\"Development of a critical-angle transmission grating spectrometer for the International X-Ray Observatory\\", Ralf K. Heilmann et al., Proc. SPIE Vol. 7437 74370G-8, 2009 A fraction of the beam from the mirror will be dispersed to a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, which will operate simultaneously with the observing MIP instrument and collect instrumental background data, which can occur when an instrument is not in the focal position. To avoid interfering the very faint astronomical signals with radiation from the telescope, the telescope itself and all its instruments must be kept cold. Therefore, the IXO Instrument Platform features a large shield that blocks the light from the Sun, Earth, and Moon, which otherwise would heat up the telescope, and interfere with the observations. IXO optics and instrumentation will provide up to 100-fold increase in effective area for high resolution spectroscopy, deep spectral, and microsecond spectroscopic timing with high count rate capability. The improvement of IXO relative to current X-ray missions is equivalent to a transition from the 200 inch Palomar telescope to a 22 m telescope while at the same time shifting from spectral band imaging to an integral field spectrograph. Launch The planned launch date for IXO was 2021, going into an orbit on either the Ariane V or Atlas V. Science operations IXO was designed to operate for a minimum of 5 years, with a goal of 10 years, so IXO science operations were anticipated to last from 2021 to 2030.

She was a member of the Parliament of Jamaica for Saint Ann North Eastern. She served briefly as the Transport and Works Minister from late November 2011 to January 2012.  Early life and education  Robinson was of Lebanese descent. She was born and raised in Claremont, Saint Ann Parish, where her parents Peter and Kathleen and grandparents all lived. She graduated from Immaculate Conception High School in Jamaica and went on to Miami Dade College, where she earned an associate degree in marketing and a diploma in public relations. She lived in the U.S. intermittently from 1978 to 2001. Career Before entering politics, Robinson worked in the banking and tourism sectors. She had been involved at the margins of politics for almost two decades as a JLP supporter, and was tapped by then-Leader of the Opposition Edward Seaga to do more work during Michael Belnavis' leave of absence. She was first elected to Parliament after the resignation of People's National Party MP Danny Melville in 2001, defeating the PNP's Carol Jackson in the resulting by-election. She was naturalised as a U.S. citizen in 2006, while sitting in Parliament. However, the following year, she renounced her citizenship at an Immigration and Naturalization Service office in Key Biscayne, Florida in advance of the 2007 Jamaican general election. She went on to defeat PNP candidate Oswest Senior- Smith in that election by 2,022 votes. After the 2007 election, former legislator Manley Bowen of the PNP, who was registered as a voter in Robinson's constituency, sought a declaration from the Supreme Court that she was not qualified to be elected due to her alleged dual citizenship. Robinson continued to hold her parliamentary seat until a court removed her in 2010 and ordered her to pay legal costs of J$15.3 million to Bowen. She went through with the formal renunciation procedure, and obtained a Certificate of Loss of Nationality in December 2010. She then won back her old seat in a by-election that month, defeating PNP challenger Devon Evans, and was sworn back in as an MP in January 2011. In November 2011, Robinson filed a challenge to the costs order in the Supreme Court on the grounds that it was excessive; she particularly objected to the J$5 million paid to professor David P. Rowe for a legal opinion about her citizenship, arguing that the information could have been obtained at much lower cost from U.S. government sources. Later that month, PM Andrew Holness named her Transport and Works Minister, succeeding Mike Henry; the move was a surprise even to Robinson herself. However, in December 2012, Bowen filed a notice of bankruptcy against Robinson in an attempt to compel her to pay the costs he had been awarded. If adjudged bankrupt, Robinson would be disqualified to sit in Parliament. In April 2013, on the day before Supreme Court Justice Lennox Campbell was scheduled to issue his ruling on the costs order appeal, Robinson came to a settlement with Bowen whereby she would pay JM$4 million, or slightly more than a quarter of his original claim.  Death  Robinson died of lung cancer on 29 May 2020. She was 66. A private funeral service is to be held at the St Matthews Anglican Church in Claremont Saint Ann on July 17 2020.

A series of chapels was planned to document the life of the saint, forming a Sacro Monte for religious meditation and veneration. Only three were eventually built. The statue was designed by Giovan Battista Crespi, (known as Il Cerano), and erected by Siro Zanella of Pavia and Bernardo Falconi of Lugano.

In 2015, Murray reached world number #1 in the Modern Pentathlon World Rankings after taking Gold at the USA World Cup followed by a 5th place at the Berlin World Championships. Murray finished in 8th Place at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, Brazil. Early life Murray was born on born 25 September 1989 in Preston, Lancashire. Murray grew up in Clitheroe and attended Brookside Primary School, and then Bowland High School in Grindleton. Murray joined Clitheroe Dolphins Swimming Club at the age of 7, and began competing in local galas. It was through the swimming club that she was asked to try a local Biathlon. Although she wasn't keen on swimming, she instantly took to running and decided to pursue running at higher level. She started training for athletics at the age of 11, joining Hyndburn Athletics Club, and went on to win the Lancashire County Championships for Cross Country and 1500 metres in her first season as an Under 13 in 2001. She continued running for Lancashire and competed at English Schools and Inter Counties throughout her teen years. She moved to Blackburn Harriers Athletes Club in 2006, after a period of difficulty with her running career. Her hero was British middle distance runner Kelly Holmes, and she was inspired by her success at the 2004 Summer Olympics. From birth, Murray was around horses as her grandparents have a small farm in Longton, Lancashire. She spent weekends and school holidays with the horses and competed from an early age at Longton Riding Club. She rode for the club at Riding Club events. Murray joined Ribble Valley Modern Pentathlon Team and began pistol shooting. She then was taken to a fencing club in Bolton and enjoyed the sport. By doing this she was able to compete in her first Modern Pentathlon. It was here where she saw a poster of Steph Cook winning the Gold Medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Murray was inspired by the poster and knew that she wanted an Olympic Medal. She had a childhood dream of competing at the Olympics. Murray went on to become National Youth Champion in Modern Pentathlon for consecutive years. She won a host of international competitions as a Junior including the Olympic Hopes Competition. Murray had a period of time out sport whilst studying for her A-Levels. at CRGS sixth form. Career She competed at the Junior World Championships and Junior European Championships in 2010, where the British team won gold in both events. Individually, she finished 8th in the World competition and 15th overall in the European event. The team of Murray, Katy Burke, Freyja Prentice and Heather Fell also competed in the 2010 World Modern Pentathlon Championships, where they placed overall in second place, winning the silver medal.

It is administratively part of Commander, Naval Surface Forces Atlantic. , the following destroyers are assigned to this squadron: , , , , , , and . Destroyer Squadron 2 is assigned to Carrier Strike Group 12. Interwar period Following the end of World War I, the U.S. Navy possessed an unprecedented number of destroyers, increased dramatically with the war emergency program ships of the and es ‚Äì known collectively as \\"flush-deckers\\" that differed from previous destroyer types that had been distinguished by raised forecastle decks. Destroyer Squadron Two first appeared in the U.S. Fleet organization in the spring of 1919, assigned to the Atlantic Fleet with the cruiser as its flagship. It comprised three destroyer flotillas, each composed of three six-ship divisions. The U.S. Pacific Fleet organization of 1 August 1919 lists Destroyer Squadron Two as a reserve force, the squadron flag in the light cruiser . It consisted of Flotilla Ten, comprising Division 29 (six ships), Division 30 (three ships), and Division 31 (six ships), and Flotilla Eleven, comprising six six-ship divisions (22, 23, 35, 32, 33 and 34), nine of the latter's ships apparently under construction, with names not yet assigned, in that they are listed only by number; some did not have commanding officers ordered to them. The ships were in caretaker status, an arrangement that continued into the summer of 1920. By September 1920, when the term \\"squadron\\" came into its present usage, Squadron Two returned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet's Destroyer Force as part of Flotilla Three, and comprised three divisions (27, 40, and 41) of reserve destroyers. By New Year's Day 1921, Division 27 was assigned to operate in European waters, as were two ships from Division 40 (the rest remaining in reserve but with one ship‚Äî- actually assigned to Division 27), and three from Division 41 (the rest in reserve). A month later, however (1 February 1921), the assignment table still carries Squadron Two under Flotilla Three, but with only one division of five ships assigned (and one of them‚Äî- still building) and based at Charleston, South Carolina. Only three of the ships in that division, however, which was carried as being in reserve had been in that unit the previous month. The table of assignment of U.S. ships for 1 September 1922 carries only four active destroyer squadrons ‚Äì Nine and Fourteen in the Atlantic Fleet and Eleven and Twelve in the Pacific‚Äîeach squadron consisting of three six-ship divisions, with a flagship for each squadron. During 1922, DesRon 2's three divisions operated with 50-percent crews as a result of post-World War I budget reductions. At that same juncture, a second table of that date [1 September 1922], set forth the \\"general plan for the organization of the United States Fleet when the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets are united for combined operations,\\" including \\"the assignment of certain vessels not now in commission\\" lists Squadron Two as under Destroyer Squadrons, Scouting Force. Squadron Two in that [hypothetical] organization comprised Divisions Four, Five, and Six, each consisting of six ships, with a squadron leader. The unit was not homogenous, however, consisting of a mix of older destroyers such as and the flush-deckers of the War Emergency Program. The Table of Organization for the United States Fleet for 1 April 1931 reflected the reappearance of Destroyer Squadron Two as part of Destroyer Flotilla Two, Destroyers, Battle Force, as part of the organization mandated in General Order No. 211 of 10 December 1930. It also marks the appearance of four-ship, vice the six-ship, divisions that had existed through 1930. Squadron Two, the flag in , at that point consisted of three divisions of flush-deckers: Division Four, consisting of , , and ; Five: , , , and ; and Six: , , , and . On 1 August 1932, Division Six's four ships were placed in Rotating Reserve Squadron 20, the Battle Force's first rotating reserve commission pool at Mare Island, Vallejo, California, replaced by , , and . By the following spring, the old Division Six that had been in rotating reserve became the new Division Four, while the rest of the squadron composition remained unchanged. became the new squadron flagship by 1 July 1933, relieved by the beginning of 1934 by while Squadron Two's three divisions went through Rotating Reserve Squadron 20 into the spring of 1935, with essentially sixteen ships rotating through the squadron during that time. Between 1933 and 1935, each of DesRon 2's divisions took a turn spending six months pierside with a caretaker crew. With fiscal constraints, the rotating reserve system permitted the Fleet to conserve scarce manpower while keeping its destroyers as prepared as possible. By October 1935, DesRon 2 gained another four-ship division, Division 19. Ships of DesRon 2 participated in training exercises in 1936, with Decatur and Roper joining the Battle Fleet on the west coast to participate in Fleet Landing Exercise (FLEX) No. 3 ‚Äì part of a series of such evolutions carried out to develop amphibious warfare tactics. Destroyer Squadron Two was decommissioned at San Diego at the start of 1937 (with Roper and Decatur going to Squadron Ten), to be re-equipped with new s. By that point, DesRon 2's new ships represented the pinnacle of American destroyer design. Unlike previous destroyer organization, where the squadron flagship was a sister ship to those that made up the squadron, the new squadron flagship would be a different class of ship from those that made up the divisions. Under the reorganization of the fleet announced by Secretary of the Navy Claude A. Swanson on 26 May 1937, effective 14 June 1937, Squadron Two, under Destroyer Flotilla One, Destroyers, Scouting Force, U.S. Fleet, would consist of Division Three and Division Four, each consisting of four Mahan-class destroyers‚ÄîDesDiv 3: , , , and ; and DesDiv 4: , , , and , with , leader of the new class of \\"destroyer leaders,\\" serving as squadron flagship. Soon thereafter, ships of the newly reconstituted Squadron Two participated in the intensive search for the famed aviator Amelia Earhart [Putnam], her navigator Frederick J. Noonan, and their twin-engine Lockheed 10-E Electra that had disappeared en route to Howland Island. On 4 July 1937, Lamson and Drayton from DesDiv 3 and Cushing from DesDiv 4 (severe vibrations in her port high-pressure turbine compelled Perkins to return to San Diego for a tender availability) joined the aircraft carrier , with Captain Jonathan S. Dowell, ComDesRon 2, assuming command of the search group. Despite six days of efforts, however, often hindered by heavy squalls, 143,242 miles flown by the carrier's scout planes, and 151,556 square miles searched, the group turned up nothing. As Captain Dowell summarized the search: \\"No sign nor any evidence of the Earhart plane was discovered.\\" As the Fleet expanded as the world drifted toward war, inevitable changes occurred in fleet organization and employment while training proceeded during 1938 and 1939. At the start of 1940, Squadron Two still consisted of the flagship Porter and two divisions of four Mahan-class ships that had equipped the squadron since it had been reconstituted in early 1937. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt retained the U.S. Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in the spring of 1940, following the conclusion of Fleet Problem XXI, Squadron Two's destroyers began operations from that base. Troubled world conditions led to a cancellation of the Fleet Problem (XXII) scheduled for 1941. Squadron composition again became homogenous during 1941 with nine s: (flagship), , , , and formed DesDiv 3, while , , and formed DesDiv 4. Originally operating in the Pacific, the Sims-class ships that comprised Squadron Two were transferred to the Atlantic (the movements highly secret, with the ships' prominent black-shadowed white hull numbers, as well as the names in black letters at their sterns being painted out) beginning in the spring of 1941, basing upon Argentia, Newfoundland; Iceland; Narragansett Bay; Casco Bay, Maine; and Boston, Massachusetts. Initially, Squadron Two was assigned to Task Force 4 (1 April 1941), then to Task Force 1 (1 July 1941). That autumn, Squadron Two's ships escorted convoys in the North Atlantic, depth-charging suspected German U-boat contacts. Second World War Soon after war engulfed the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, however, Squadron Two's ships returned to the Pacific in December 1941 with the first carrier deployed to the Pacific, , and operated with \\"The Mighty Y\\" in the Early Pacific Raids (February‚ÄìMarch 1942), the Battle of the Coral Sea (4‚Äì8 May 1942) (where Sims was lost), and the Battle of Midway (4‚Äì6 June 1942) (where Hammann was lost while screening salvage operations of Yorktown). O'Brien succumbed to torpedo damage in the wake of the torpedoing of in September, while Walke was lost in November at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. The first year of combat in the Pacific had thinned Squadron Two down to five ships ‚Äì Morris, Anderson, Hughes, Mustin and Russell. Since before World War II, the first two ships of the ten-ship Benham class had operated in the Pacific, attached to DesRon 6. Of those, was lost in the same action as Walke. after a west coast overhaul in late 1943, joined DesRon 2 on her return to the war zone, bringing its strength back to six ships. Meanwhile, DesDiv 15‚ÄîBenham- class destroyers , , and ‚Äîhad operated in the Atlantic and Mediterranean with Wasp and, in June 1942, escorted her to the Pacific. Wilson fought at the Battle of Savo Island in August 1942 and Sterett participated in the Battle of Guadalcanal in November, where she earned a Presidential Unit Citation. In the summer of 1943, while DesRon 2 was dispersed with Hughes, Mustin and Morris operating in the Aleutian Islands, DesDiv 15‚Äîless Wilson‚Äîunder Commodore Rodger W. Simpson, formed Support Division A-2 in Commodore Frederick Moosbrugger's victory at the Battle of Vella Gulf. Ellet, Lang, Stack, Sterett and Wilson joined DesRon 2 later in the war. In 1944, the five Sims-class veterans were combined into DesDiv 3 of DesRon 2 while the veteran DesDiv 15 was reassigned as DesDiv 4. In 1943 and 1944 respectively, and were also transferred to the squadron from the Mediterranean where they, like (the 12th and last ship of the Sims class, lost in the Mediterranean), had served as squadron flagships. Although assigned to DesRon 2 in 1945, those two ships never operated with it as a unit. Beginning in late 1943, DesRon 2 participated in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, where Anderson was hit by shore battery fire. Invasions of the Marianas, western New Guinea, Palau and the Philippines followed. In 1945, the Okinawa campaign saw Anderson, Hughes, Morris, Sterett and Wilson suffering kamikaze damage, with the squadron's historical files being lost in flagship Morris when she was hit by a kamikaze. The combined record of the ships of DesRon 2 included 145 battle stars (some earned while attached to other units) including ten or more stars for all ships that survived the war. More than 450 of the squadron's men had died, however, and 175 had been wounded. Scrapping disposed of Lang, Sterett, Russell, Morris and Roe while Stack, Wilson, Hughes, Anderson, Mustin and Wainwright served as targets during Operation Crossroads, the Bikini atomic tests. There, while Anderson was sunk in Test Able on 1 July 1946, Stack, Wilson, Mustin, Hughes and Wainwright survived both Tests Able and Baker. Scientists monitored the contaminated ships until 1948, when they were scuttled by gunfire‚ÄîStack, Wilson, Mustin and Wainwright off Kwajalein in April and July, and Hughes, the last surviving member of the squadron, near California's Farallon Islands in October. Immediate postwar period The post-World War II period was analogous to the post-World War I time, when the U.S. Navy's destroyer forces consisted of large numbers of wartime construction-program ships, at a time of demobilization. The Wickes and Clemson classes were to the 1917‚Äì1920 destroyer force what the Allen M. Sumner and Gearing classes were to the destroyer force of 1944‚Äì1946. In January 1946, DesRon 66 included (flagship), , , , , in Division 131; and the , , and , in Division 132. DesRon 66 was then redesignated as DesRon 2, composed of DesDivs 21 and 22, and ordered to the Atlantic, where it came under Destroyers, Second Fleet. DesRon 2's complement of 2,200-tonners remained constant through the summer of 1946, when was reassigned from the Pacific Fleet, replacing Strong in DesDiv 21. DesRon 2 conducted a cold weather cruise toward the end of that year (29 October-9 November 1946), departing NS Argentia and steaming up the east coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, and then returning by way of the Strait of Belle Isle, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Cabot Strait. The operation, as Capt. Walter C. Ford, ComDesRon 2 (additionally ComDesDiv 21), noted later, \\"enabled the officers and men to become acquainted with a waterway which will be of great importance in any future war, both defensively and for convoy routing‚Ä¶\\" The ships encountered two severe storms, however, one with winds gusting up to 50 knots for 36 hours, the second with wind velocities of 56 knots that caused 60 degree rolls. Flagship Putnam incurred damage to the gunshield of Mt. 51. The ships assigned to DesRon 2 remained constant through the autumn of 1949, after which DesDiv 21 does not appear in the Atlantic Fleet Destroyer Force, while DesDiv 22 remained intact at the start of 1950. Soon thereafter, however, DesRon 2 received a new group of ships, 2,425 tonners: six of the nine being classified as \\"destroyer escorts\\" (DDE). The new DesDiv 21 consisted of , , , and ; DesDiv 22 consisted of , , and . By 1 October 1950, Harwood was reassigned to DesDiv 22. Early in 1951, however, the composition of DesRon 2 changed again (to 2,200 tonners) with DesDiv 21 becoming a six-ship division that included four destroyers and two radar picket destroyers (DDR) by 1 February: , , , Strong (back for a second tour in DesRon 2) , and . DesDiv 22 was composed of , , and . Further changes, however, occurred in the summer of 1951. While DesDiv 21 remained largely unchanged, with Charles P. Cecil shifted to that unit but temporarily assigned to DesDiv 221 effective \\"about 20 August‚Ä¶\\", DesDiv 22 was reconstituted with , , and (the last-named ship carrying on the distinguished tradition of a former DesRon 2 flagship from the 1930s) Korean War With the onset of hostilities in Korea in 1950, Atlantic Fleet destroyers were deployed to the Far East to augment the Pacific Fleet's destroyer forces. DesRon 2's DesDiv 22 served between October 1950 and May 1951; DesDiv 21 between June and September 1952; only USS Charles P. Cecil did not deploy to the war zone, being temporarily assigned to DesDiv 22 from 21 when it deployed to Korea. DesRon 2's ships served with distinction both as a part of Task Forces (TF) 77 and 95, supporting shore bombardment, search and rescue, anti-submarine screening (Hunter/Killer Groups), picket duty, and air-control missions. Its ships also provided anti-submarine screening for the carriers of TF 77 conducting raids against North Korean hydroelectric power stations on the Yalu River. Aircraft from the carriers , , , and took part in these massive raids in concert with U.S. Air Force planes. At the end of August 1952, Barton joined DesDiv 21 in a hunter-killer antisubmarine training exercise off the east coast of Japan before rejoining TF 77 on 15 September. The tour proved brief, however, for, on the evening of the 16th, the destroyer struck a floating mine, the explosion tearing a 15-foot by 25-foot hole in the starboard side, completely flooding the forward fireroom and killing five men and wounding seven of those on watch there. Fast and effective action by the repair parties kept Barton afloat and enabled her to reach Sasebo on 20 September where she made temporary repairs. Charles P. Cecil, meanwhile, was returned to DesDiv 21 in the spring of 1953, but by the summer had been reassigned out of DesRon 2 entirely. DesRon 2's composition remained unchanged during 1954, with DesDiv 21 ‚Äì Barton (flag), Soley, and Strong, joined by the radar picket destroyer , visiting Durban, Natal, Union of South Africa (3‚Äì8 July), then Cape Town (10‚Äì12 July) before heading for South America, after a deployment with the 7th Fleet. The same four ships visited Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (22‚Äì25 July), then Recife (28‚Äì29 July) after which they proceeded to Port of Spain, Trinidad. Training exercises and Atlantic Fleet maneuvers out of Norfolk, generally operating in the Virginia capes area and the West Indies, followed as the composition of DesRon 2 remained constant during 1955 and into 1956. Hunter- killer antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training prepared the ships to return to the Mediterranean. The ships participated in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Exercise Whipsaw, after which Barton and Soley steamed to Port Said, Egypt, to transit the Suez Canal and proceed into the Persian Gulf for a routine six-week patrol with the Middle East Force. On 29 October 1956, Barton and Soley started south from the vicinity of Abadan, Iran, to leave the gulf, circumnavigate the Arabian Peninsula, and retransit the Suez Canal. Hostilities broke out that same day between Israel and Egypt, however, over Egypt's nationalization of the canal - the Suez Crisis. The war closed the waterway, and subsequent international military action prompted Egypt to block it with sunken ships. Meanwhile, Barton and Soley anchored in Sitrah Harbor, Bahrain, and stood by in case a need arose to evacuate Americans from the region. Operating from Bahrain, Barton spent the next two months anchored at night and conducting tactical and gunnery drills by day. Finally, on 12 December, the destroyer received orders directing her around the Cape of Good Hope to Norfolk, where she tied up on 5 February 1957. DesRon 2 continued to operate with the same ships into 1958. Following a period of upkeep, Barton prepared to put to sea on 14 March, and soon thereafter she, along with USS William M. Wood received orders to escort the guided missile heavy cruiser as she carried President Dwight D. Eisenhower to Bermuda to confer with British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. Barton carried members of the press to the ceremony and stood guard with William M. Wood at the entrance to the harbor. The destroyer then conducted ASW patrol and spent time in Norfolk in upkeep before going into drydock in Newport News for hull repairs. Barton exited Chesapeake Bay on 1 July and set out for yet another Mediterranean cruise. After several weeks of training operations with NATO forces and other units of the 6th Fleet, Barton anchored in Port Said on the night of 20 September. The following day, she and Soley transited the Suez Canal together once again and then headed to the Persian Gulf for a month of operations with the Iranian Navy. In November 1958, Barton (DesRon 2 flagship), along with Soley and John R. Pierce, visited the Mediterranean, mooring briefly at Gibraltar as well as at Taranto, Italy, where, while entering port, the oiler , accompanying DesRon 2 and the attack carrier , rescued an Italian fisherman from his boat suffering from a cerebral hemorrhage. La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, Bari's provincial newspaper, published a laudatory article concerning the rescue. As the new year 1959 began, DesRon 2 was still operating under the operational control of Commander, 6th Fleet, with John R. Pierce and Soley having worked round-the-clock through Christmas of 1958 and New Year's Day of 1959, endeavoring to prevent the sinking of the Panamanian-flag tanker Mirador following an onboard explosion and fire at Iskenderun Bay, Turkey; DC2 John L. King, from Soleys damage control party, perished in the battle with the flames, but the destroyermen managed to quell the fires. A second outbreak of fire on board Mirador in mid-January, however, caused another explosion that eventually claimed the ship, and in the process set afire the Turkish salvage vessel Imroz, that Soley saved when her firefighters made quick work of the flames. In February 1959, after a strong storm with 70 miles-per-hour winds suddenly arose off the Arabian coast, sinking several small fishing craft, Strong sped to the scene and searched those waters for over 24 hours, eventually rescuing 13 local fishermen. With all eight ships in the squadron in one place for the first time since the 1958‚Äì1959 Mediterranean deployment began, DesRon 2 gathered at Gibraltar on 28 March 1959 to begin the homeward voyage. Returning to the United States on 8 April 1959, the squadron lost Strong to DesRon 32, and received no replacement, making DesRon 2 a seven-ship squadron. From that point through June, DesRon 2's ships underwent needed maintenance, with an interim yard availability assigned concurrently with a tender availability. The first squadron to \\"feel the full effect of the change in policy lengthening the overhaul cycle to three years,\\" with \\"budget slashes, antiquity, rapid turnover of key [people] and reduced manning levels\\" magnifying maintenance problems. \\"Keeping our ships in fighting trim and ready for all commitments,\\" one observer noted, \\"now, more than ever before, requires all-out effort and cooperation from all hands at all times.\\" Soon thereafter, ships from DesRon 2 were assigned to the operational control of Commander Antisubmarine Defense Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, which conducted Hunter-Killer (HUK) operations with the antisubmarine warfare support carrier . In those exercises, DesRon 2 destroyers acted as the coordinating unit of a team that included fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, to test new attack and screening methods against conventional and nuclear-powered submarines. \\"Tomorrow,\\" one observer wrote, \\"in the event of an all-out war, we must fight with the weapons we have today, not those on the drafting boards.\\" While destroyermen admitted that \\"the nuclear-powered submarine has the edge in the contest, our assignment is to dull this edge and eventually gain the upper hand.\\" After spending 1960 operating with Task Group ALFA, DesRon 2 undertook training both at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Norfolk, Virginia, where ships also underwent overhaul in 1961, and operated in support of Project Mercury space shot operations. In addition, Soley proceeded to the waters off the Dominican Republic, in readiness to evacuate Americans if unrest should arise in the wake of the assassination of Rafael Trujillo, as did Borie and Wallace L. Lind, after which the latter two ships \\"chased [Project] Mercury shots‚Ä¶and a myriad of other assignments.\\" On 9 September 1961, the Norfolk, Va., based Barton, Soley, John R. Pierce, English, and Hank proceeded to the Mediterranean to operate with the Sixth Fleet, leaving Borie and Wallace L. Lind in Norfolk, where they began Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) II conversions on 21 November and 22 December, respectively. The Mediterranean deployment involved fleet exercises as well as visits to liberty ports including Suda Bay, Crete; Piraeus, Greece; Naples and Genoa, Italy, and Monte Carlo, Monaco. Following her refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, the Fletcher-class , assigned to the squadron on 1 October 1961, joined the squadron for its Mediterranean deployment in January 1962, and returned to Norfolk with the squadron on 31 March 1962; she would remain assigned to DesRon 2 until 9 July, when she sailed to enter the Reserve Fleet at Galveston, Texas. Remaining briefly in port, the squadron ‚Äì minus Borie and Wallace L. Lind ‚Äì took part in an amphibious demonstration for President John F. Kennedy at Onslow Beach, North Carolina. Resuming Mercury shot recovery operations, John R. Pierce recovered the Aurora 7 capsule after a helicopter from had retrieved astronaut Lt. Comdr. M. Scott Carpenter, on 24 May 1962 off Puerto Rico. Cuban Missile Crisis to 1990s With the onset of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the autumn of 1962, DesRon 2, commanded by Capt. George R. Reinhart, departed Norfolk for the Caribbean along with much of the Atlantic Fleet. There, the squadron performed myriad tasks that included support for carrier operations, ASW support for Service Forces, Atlantic and Amphibious Forces, Atlantic units, escort duty for ships evacuating Americans from Guantanamo Bay, and filling the quarantine line. John R. Pierce, along with sistership , boarded and inspected the Lebanese-flagged freighter Marucla, contracted by the Soviet Union to carry cargo to Cuba, the first vessel boarded after imposition of the quarantine, on 26 October 1962. When the crisis abated, English and Hank returned to Norfolk on 27 November and the rest of DesRon 2 during the first week of December. From 1963 to 1966, DesRon 2 carried out Operation Springboard training as part of Anti-Submarine Warfare Forces, Atlantic Fleet. DesRon 2 also deployed to the Mediterranean during these years. Organizationally, joined DesDiv 21, Borie was reassigned to DesDiv 21, while USS John R. Pierce was reassigned to DesDiv 22 on 1 January 1963. Soon thereafter, in March 1963, Barton, John R. Pierce, Soley, English, and Hank operated under the Commander Mid East Force while serving in the Red and Arabian Seas as well and the Indian Ocean. In April, Wallace L. Lind participated in the unsuccessful search for the submarine , then on 13 June broke the flag of Admiral Harold Page Smith, Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, as he observed the firing of a Polaris missile from the fleet ballistic missile submarine . At the end of a Mediterranean deployment in August 1963, Barton and Borie made a goodwill tour of the Baltic Sea to support Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson's Scandinavian tour. The destroyers held \\"open ship\\" for general visiting at Copenhagen, Denmark, and Helsinki, Finland, before heading home on 10 September, proceeding via the Kiel Canal, Portsmouth, England, and the Azores. Meanwhile, Furse joined the squadron upon completion of her FRAM I conversion (15 September); Hank and English were transferred to the Reserve Fleet on 1 October; and Richard E. Kraus, upon completion of her FRAM I conversion that had begun on 30 June at Boston, rejoined on 15 October. During 1964, , , and were assigned to DesRon 2, enlarging its complement to ten ships, each division composed of five ships: DesDiv 21 with Blandy, Borie, Barton, and Steinaker; DesDiv 22 with Furse, Murray, Wallace L. Lind, John R. Pierce and Robert A. Owens. On 26 May 1965, the squadron sailed to participate in the Project Gemini GT-4 Recovery Mission, after which it stopped in Lisbon, Portugal. Aside from cruises, the squadron continued training operations, including exercise Straight Laced, a NATO ASW/Strike exercise. Most of DesRon 2's resources were devoted to training ships in anti-submarine warfare in 1967. During the January Mediterranean transit, Steinaker surfaced a Soviet Foxtrot-class submarine. With six of nine squadron ships deployed to the Mediterranean, ComDesRon 2 functioned as a part of the Gold Group of Task Force 60, the fast carrier attack force of the Sixth Fleet. The squadron engaged in training with four other navies, but led the second annual Spanish-American bilateral exercise, dubbed SpanEx 1‚Äì67. Returning home afforded opportunities to conduct low flyer recognition and satellite reconnaissance training. The next year, 1968, saw DesRon 2's temporary transfer to the Western Pacific (WestPac), when the squadron ‚Äì Blandy, Rich, Borie and Steinaker ‚Äî was ordered to Vietnam to operate with the Seventh Fleet. Its first division arrived at Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines, on 6 May and the second division on 20 May. On 11 May, Blandy with Capt. Frank C. Dunham embarked, cleared Subic Bay, and arrived off the I Corps area, Vietnam. There Capt. Dunham assumed command of all naval gunfire support operations by allied forces for the entire coast of South Vietnam. In addition, ships of DesRon 2 took part in Operation Sea Dragon, providing suppression fire against North Vietnamese coastal defense gun sites. DesRon 2 concluded combat responsibilities associated with its WestPac deployment on October 1. After leaving Subic Bay, the integrity of each of DesRon 2's divisions was disrupted, and the squadron failed to reunite until its return to Norfolk in November. While in Vietnam, DesRon 2 tallied over 350 killed of the enemy, over 2,300 military structures damaged or destroyed, and over sixty major caliber enemy weapons silenced. Rich exemplified the other aspect of the work of the ships of DesRon 2, when she steamed to Yankee Station, where, from 13 May to 20 July 1968 she provided escort and plane guard services for four successive attack aircraft carriers: , , , and in Tonkin Gulf. The squadron was restructured in July 1969 as part of a reordering within the Cruiser-Destroyer Force. All ships, except Robert A. Owens were transferred from DesRon 2 to other squadrons, and the new squadron's DesDiv 21 comprised guided missile frigate , , and that spent the rest of the year in Norfolk for leave, upkeep, and availabilities. The following year, 1970, DesRon 2 participated in extensive training, first, in the Caribbean for RIMEX IV-70, and later in the Mediterranean where, as part of TF 60, it conducted Exercise National Week in the Ionian Sea. While in the Mediterranean, the squadron distinguished itself in responding to the Fedayeen hijacking of four airliners to Jordan that endangered American citizens in Jordan, and received the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its action on that contingency mission. After ComDesRon 2 planned with the ComPhibLant and Hellenic Destroyer Squadron staffs for the NATO Exercise Deep Express/Deep South, the squadron returned to Norfolk on 17 November. It passed most of 1971 training either in Norfolk or in the Caribbean, the latter engaged in Springboard operations, before embarking on another Mediterranean deployment on 1 December. Under the flagship, guided missile cruiser , DesRon 2 began 1972 by sailing from Valencia, Spain, to intercept, follow, and gather intelligence on Soviet warships in the Western Mediterranean as part of Bystander Operations. The squadron participated in National Week Operations in February, and when a special operation was cancelled, moored at Athens for Administrative and Material Inspection. After visiting Italy and Monte Carlo, the squadron returned to Norfolk on 29 June 1972, and commenced a standdown. In 1973, Richard E. Byrd resumed Springboard operations in the Puerto Rico operating areas before sailing for extended operations with the Sixth Fleet to the Mediterranean, where she remained until 1 December due to the tensions incident to the Yom Kippur War. Other ships engaged in training exercises or remained at Norfolk. The squadron's actions through 1973 were of a similar variety, including Atlantic Fleet Readiness exercises in the Puerto Rico operating area as well as a deployment to the Mediterranean in November for duty with the Sixth Fleet. In November, ComDesRon 2 participated in Operation Quick Draw with Italian Navy units, and the next month, took part in National Week XVI, before spending the holidays in Barcelona, Spain and returning to Norfolk on 15 May 1975. The squadron passed the summer of 1975 in Norfolk, before it conducted SXTEX 2‚Äì76 and COMPTUEX 2‚Äì76 exercises in September in Norfolk and off the Virginia capes, and following a successful MISSILEX operation, remained in Norfolk until the end of the year. As it entered 1976, ComDesRon 2 embarked in McCandless, shifted his pennant to Mitscher, and assisted with the major NATO exercise, Safe Pass'76 (6‚Äì24 March). In May, DesRon 2 participated in the Joint U.S. exercise, Solid Shield, and in July, proceeded to Rota, Spain for duty with Commander Carrier Group 2 and Commander Sixth Fleet. While deployed, DesRon 2 took part in ASW Week exercises as well as National Week XXI (23 August-24 September). Participating in further ASW exercises and visiting ports in Italy, France, and Spain, it remained in the Mediterranean for the remainder of the year, and, on 30 December, set out to conduct surveillance operations in the Gulf of Sollum off the United Arab Republic and Libyan littorals. After completion of that work and brief port visits in Spain, DesRon 2 returned to Norfolk for upkeep, but returned to Europe in June for a month-long tour, labeled Exercise Silver Jubilee, the multinational exercise coinciding with celebrations for Queen Elizabeth's 25-year reign. In April 1978, DesRon 2 became one of six non-deploying readiness squadrons. At the start of the year, DesRon 2 consisted of six guided missile destroyers, three frigates, three Spruance-class destroyers and . A reorganization of the Atlantic Fleet Destroyer squadrons on 4 April gave DesRon 2 an administrative disparate complement of 16 ships, a number lessened by one with the decommissioning of on 1 June. By year's end, the squadron included: guided missile destroyers , , , , , USS Richard E. Byrd, , , , , the frigates and , destroyers Dupont and Blandy and guided missile frigate . ComDesRon 2 provided support for the ships under his administrative control as immediate unit commander, and served as chief inspector for nuclear weapons acceptance inspections, Navy technical proficiency inspections, embarked in various ships to observe operational propulsion plant inspections, visited assigned ships undergoing overhauls in remote locations to monitor progress of the work, and carried out at-sea operational readiness inspections of various units. In June 1982, ComDesRon 2 Anti-Air Warfare Tactics Board was established to serve as a forum for tactical dialogue. The following year the squadron introduced the Personnel Training Initiatives Program in order to provide its ships with additional means for training key people. Focusing on three areas, these training initiatives sent undesignated seamen and firemen to Class \\"A\\" schools on returnable quotas, transferred Second Class Petty Officers and those of higher rank for temporary additional duty with Fleet Training Group at Guantanamo Bay for four to six weeks, and cross-decked E-5's and above to ships undergoing refresher training. The training program met with encouraging results. Continuing its training efforts over the next three years, ComDesRon 2 served as Chief Inspector for Nuclear Weapons Acceptance Inspections, Navy Technical Proficiency Inspections, Type Commander 3M and Supply Management Inspections, and increased the number of Command Inspections it conducted overall. ComDesRon 2 retained its role as CINTEX Coordinator for the Norfolk waterfront. In order to enhance training, new initiatives were implemented, including the integration of MUTTS (Multi-Units Tactical Training System), ULQ-13 Countermeasures Signal Stimulator Vans, and U.S. Air Force AWACS assets into formal CINTEX Training scenarios. The next year, NTISA DET, FLETCCORGRU 2, and NAVSECGRU were included. Furthermore, efforts to integrate inter-service participation within CINTEX were introduced. These included participation by the AWACS assets and Coast Guard ships, as well as foreign warship participation during Norfolk port visits. And for her work in 1984, Preble earned the Arleigh Burke Award Trophy for displaying the greatest improvement in Battle Efficiency within the Atlantic Fleet. The CMS QuickLooks program, which provided for one-day notice CMS quicklooks on board squadron units was continued, and, on 10 December 1986, CinCLantFlt Inspector General's office conducted a surprise command security inspection of CDS-2 Staff and attached ships, of which ComDesRon 2 had the best seen security program to date. In 1989, ComDesRon 2 was assigned as OTC for Type Commander's Core Training Exercise, and was home-ported in Charleston, South Carolina. In September, the squadron's training in the Puerto Rican Operating area ended abruptly as Hurricane Hugo thrashed St. Thomas, St. John, and Puerto Rico. ComDesRon 2 assumed on scene commander for relief efforts, for which the squadron was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal in February 1991. The unit also assumed waterfront in-port training responsibilities for all Cruiser- Destroyer Group 8 units. CINTEX exercises also occurred with an emphasis on Basic Command and Control. Over the next two years, DesRon 2 provided material, administrative, and operational support to the ships under its direct administrative control including units temporarily assigned from Cruiser-Destroyer Group 8. As a training agent for Commander, Cruiser- Destroyer Group 8, ComDesRon 2 conducted weekly waterfront in-port training in Radio/Combat Information Center and Visual Communication. In addition, specific ASW, convoy, amphibious warfare, and Anti-Surface Warfare exercises occupied the unit's time. Besides participating in these and other training exercises, ComDesRon 2 acted as Regional Training Conference Board Chairman for team trainers managed by ComTraLant. Post Cold War DesRon 2 experienced dramatic changes in 1992. As a result of the Navy's reorganization and downsizing plans, Destroyer Squadron 10 was decommissioned on 1 September, and DesRon 2 absorbed its Spruance and Kidd-class destroyers and Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers, raising the number of classes maintained and trained by DesRon 2 to five. As part of that realignment, ComDesRon 2 also assumed the title of Commander, Naval Surface Group Norfolk (ComNavSurfGru). With that added responsibility, DesRon 2 provided the oversight for the manning, material, and readiness for all cruisers and destroyers home-ported in Norfolk. As training agent for ships based there, ComDesRon 2 led bi-weekly waterfront in-port training in both Radio/Combat Information Center and Visual Communications, coordinated mutual training exercises between surface and subsurface units with bi-weekly mutual training meetings, and served as Training Conference Board Chairman for team trainers managed by ComTraLant. Throughout 1993 and 1994, with the arrival of three new Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, DesRon 2 expanded to include 18 ships. In the Commander Naval Surface Group capacity, the command swelled to a total of 32 ships as a result of the commissioning of new ships as well as homeport shifts in accordance with the Base Realignment and Closure decisions. In addition to its 1994 routine deployments to the Mediterranean, Caribbean, and North Atlantic, the squadron assisted in Haiti as a part of Operation Support Democracy and conducted Cuban migrant rescues during Operation Able Vigil. Other missions that year included a deployment to the Adriatic where the unit conducted both surface and air surveillance against the former republic of Yugoslavia in compliance with United Nations Sanctions, Maritime Interdiction Operations to enforce United Nations Sanctions against Iraq in the Northern Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and UNITAS XXXV with South American allies. In June 1995, as part of the Navy's new \\"Forward‚Ä¶from the Sea\\" missions, the Atlantic Fleet's surface combatant ships were reorganized into six core battle groups, nine destroyer squadrons and a new Western Hemisphere Group. The squadrons were assigned to the battle groups on a rotational basis, depending on where they are in their maintenance and deployment cycles. DesRon 2, formerly a non- deploying readiness squadron, was disestablished, and converted to a Sea Duty command with a new staff and four permanently assigned ships: , destroyers and , and the guided missile frigate . Those restructurings raised the squadron's ship tally to 29 and caused NavSurfGru Norfolk's ranks to number 43 ships. DesRon 2 began its 1996 training in May, when the squadron cruised to the Puerto Rican Operations area for INDEX 96-2 and Naval Gunfire Support qualification. After successful training exercises, deployed in July for a two-and-a-half month UNITAS 37‚Äì96 missions, in which an American task group circumnavigates South America while conducting joint exercises with host- nation navies along the route. Following its UNITAS deployment, DesRon 2 spent the rest of 1996 at Norfolk. While preparing to deploy to the Mediterranean, Commodore, Capt. Jimmie R. Jackson was relieved by Capt. Samuel J. Locklear III. At that time, the squadron's focus shifted from administrative oversight of four ships to tactical operations and preparations for the Mediterranean deployment. Assigned the role of Sea Combat Commander (SCC) for the Battle Group at the Warfare Commanders Conference, DesRon 2's responsibilities included Undersea Warfare, Surface Warfare, Maritime Interception Operations, and Screen Commander. In December, joined DesRon 2, while the following year, 1998, saw the loss of Kauffman and the gain of and . Capping a successful year of preparation for deployment, Kauffman won the Battle \\"E\\" award. In June 1998, DesRon 2 departed Norfolk, ComDesRon 2 embarked in Dwight D. Eisenhower as the Sea Combat Commander as part of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Battle Group, and participated in seven bi-lateral and multi-lateral exercises, as well as supporting NATO in enforcing NATO Security Council Resolutions during the Kosovo crisis. DesRon 2 ‚Äì with guided missile destroyers Arleigh Burke, Mitscher, and Porter, destroyers Stump and Deyo, and guided missile frigate Carr permanently assigned ‚Äì began the year 2000 at Norfolk, then participated in a group sail with the Battle Group, ComDesRon 2 in Porter (31 January-10 February). DesRon 2 participated in a second group sail in the spring (3‚Äì17 May), with the squadron commander on board Stump, after which time the squadron carried out training off the Virginia capes (19‚Äì24 June), with ComDesRon 2 again in Stump. Further training followed, including exercise Unified Spirit with Harry S. Truman (11‚Äì26 October), as the squadron prepared to deploy to the Mediterranean. That scheduled movement as part of the Harry S. Truman Battle Group began on 28 November, ComDesRon 2 in Porter. DesRon 2 visited M√°laga, Spain, beginning on 11 December, then conducted exercises at sea (18 December), and began a port visit to Barcelona three days before Christmas of 2000. Following a port visit to Dubrovnik, Croatia (5‚Äì9 January 2001), ComDesRon 2 in Porter, serving as Commander Task Force 60 with the departure of Harry S. Truman deploying to the Persian Gulf, got underway for the eastern Mediterranean to conduct Reliant Mermaid, after which the ships paused briefly at Souda Bay, Crete (2‚Äì5 February). Proceeding thence to Haifa, Israel, for exercise Juniper Cobra I, ComDesRon 2 logged a succession of Mediterranean locations: Souda Bay, Crete; Capo Teulada, Sardinia; and Split, Croatia; Naples, Palma, and Gaeta, and La Maddalena, Italy; Toulon, France; Aksaz, Turkey; before replenishing at Souda Bay (18 April). Punctuating the remainder of the deployment with exercises Babylon Express (19 April) and SHAREM 137 (21 April), and visits to Antalya, Turkey and a return call to Gaeta, and M√°laga, ComDesRon 2 embarked in Stump for the return crossing on 11 May, and reached Norfolk on the 24th, concluding the deployment of the Harry S. Truman Battle Group DesRon 2 began the year 2002 with five permanently assigned ships, Arleigh Burke, Porter, Stump, (that had been assigned to DesRon 2 on 1 December 2001), and Carr, with ComDesRon 2 inport at Norfolk. ComDesRon 2 embarked in Porter on 15 January in preparation for a joint tactical forces exercise with the Battle Group, and the latter sailed on 18 January to conduct those evolutions, returning to port on 26 January, with ComDesRon 2 serving as Opposition Force, Officer Controlling Exercise during that evolution. During the summer of 2002, Porter and Stump, as well as guided missile frigate , destroyer and guided missile destroyer , participated in Midshipmen Core Training '02, providing instruction to 130 NROTC midshipmen (17‚Äì21 June). Two major antisubmarine warfare exercises followed during the summer. The first was Smart Search '02 (12‚Äì19 July) during which a ready destroyer squadron deployed on short notice in the event of the proximity of a forward-deployed submarine, using Arleigh Burke, Carr, and Porter, in addition to organic LAMPS helicopters and other assets. The second was Keflavik Tactical Exercise '02/SHAREM 143 that took place between 26 August and 23 September. A number of group sails brought the training cycle for the year to a close for several of the ships attached to DesRon 2. On 14 December, ComDesRon 2 embarked in the carrier . In January 2003, ComDesRon 2 departed Norfolk in Theodore Roosevelt and surge-deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During that period, ComDesRon 2 served as the SCC for the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group operating in the Eastern Mediterranean as part of Task Force 60. As the SCC, ComDesRon 2 was responsible for numerous mission areas, including surface warfare, force defense, LAMPS element coordinator and Maritime Interception Operations (MIO) commander. The strike group's ships and aircraft conducted tactical air and TLAM strikes into Iraqi during combat operations from the Eastern Mediterranean. As MIO commander, ComDesRon 2 planned and executed a number of critical boardings of suspect vessels. Further, during Operation Iraqi Freedom the SCC managed the daily scheme of maneuver of all CTF 60 forces, including two aircraft carriers and up to 14 surface combatants. Despite deploying four months earlier than scheduled, the ships and staff of DesRon 2 successfully executed a number of critical missions in support of combat operations. In 2004, DesRon 2 was assigned to Commander Carrier Strike Group 12. Cole and McFaul shifted squadrons and Stump was decommissioned. During October and November, DesRon 2 participated in a major multi-national exercise, United Kingdom Joint Conference (JMC 04-3). Working with the Royal Navy's Commander Amphibious Task Group Staff, commanded by Commodore C.J. Parry, RN, ComDesRon 2 embarked in , Arleigh Burke, Winston S. Churchill, and Porter participated in that exercise that stressed naval and marine coalition coordination in a littoral environment. ComDesRon 2 commenced 2005 with all ships in the Unit Level Training Phase and Intermediate Training Phase. In May, ComDesRon 2 embarked in Porter for Submarine Commander's Course (SCC) Operation 05‚Äì2 with Arleigh Burke, Carr, and . Effective August 25, 2005, ISIC/TACON functions of guided missile frigate were transferred to ComDesRon 2 and ComCarStrikeGru 12. During the winter months of 2004 and into the New Year 2005 ComDesRon 2 focused on the upcoming deployment as Sea Combat Commander for the Strike Group. Multiple Groupsails, Maritime Group Inport Training (MGIT), COMPTUEX, and JTFEX flexed the staff in a number of missions within the Surface, Strike, and Anti-Submarine/Undersea Warfare areas including Maritime Security, Show-of-Force, Mine Countermeasure, Anti-Piracy, MIO/VBSS, and TLAM Operations. The squadron deployed with Enterprise Strike Group in 2006. DesRon 2 again accomplished a myriad of diverse missions across Second, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Fleets. As of June 2010, the squadron comprised USS Arleigh Burke, , Stout, , , , and . ComDesRon 2 will deploy with the Enterprise Strike Group. In May 2019, 3 of these ships escort the : , and .

Acheson, 344 U.S. 133 (1952), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a person born in the United States, with both U.S. citizenship and a foreign citizenship obtained via an alien parent or parents, does not need to live in or return to the United States as an adult in order to retain U.S. citizenship. The citizenship status of Joseph Mandoli, a man born in the U.S. to Italian parents who took him as a baby to live with them in Italy, was challenged on several grounds, including primarily the fact that he had remained in Italy as an adult and had not returned to live in the United States upon reaching adulthood. Lower courts had rejected Mandoli's claim to U.S. citizenship on the basis of a 1939 Supreme Court case, Perkins v. Elg, which had suggested that a person born in the U.S. with both U.S. and foreign citizenship needed to affirmatively choose U.S. citizenship (by returning to and establishing residence in the U.S.) as an adult, but the Court rejected this interpretation in the Mandoli case. Mandoli's claim to U.S. citizenship was originally also challenged because he had served in the Italian armed forces and sworn an oath of allegiance to the Italian king while living in Italy. However, the government dropped these reasons on appeal, apparently because it was considered likely that Mandoli had not performed these actions voluntarily, as the conscription laws under the Benito Mussolini government in Italy would have made it effectively impossible for Mandoli to avoid military service.

She has won a series of medals at European and World Championships, but was not selected for the 2008 Summer Olympics by the British team due to the limited number of places available. After considering retiring in 2009, she returned to the sport and in 2012 she won gold medals in both the individual and the team events at the 2012 World Championships, and qualified to be chosen for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Early life Mhairi Spence was born in Inverness, Scotland, on 31 August 1985. She was a member of the Pony Club at an early age, competing in Tetrathlon from the age of ten. She was inspired to change disciplines by the British athletes competing in women's Modern Pentathlon when it made its d√©but at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. She graduated from the University of Bath with a degree in Coach Education and Sports Development. Career After seeing the 2000 Summer Olympics, she began training in fencing so that she could switch disciplines to Modern Pentathlon. After four weeks in the new sport, she won her class at the British Youth Championships. She competed at the 2006 Commonwealth Fencing Championships for Scotland, where she won the bronze medal. Women's Modern Pentathlon features five events, first fencing, then swimming, showjumping, and finally a discipline combining running and pistol shooting. She considers fencing to be her favourite discipline of Modern Pentathlon. To qualify for an Olympic Games in Modern Pentathlon, athletes must reach a minimum standard. Prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics, Spence met the standard required to qualify for the Games, but as there are only two spots in each team for the sport she wasn't selected for the British team, Heather Fell and Katy Livingston were chosen instead. In 2009, she contemplated retiring from the sport, and returned to the family home in Scotland but following an early morning run in sub-zero temperatures, she decided she still had the passion to compete. She finished 3rd (or Bronze) at the 2011 World Modern Pentathlon World Cup. She finished in eight place at the 2011 World Modern Pentathlon Championships. At the first World Cup event of 2012, held in Charlotte, North Carolina, she took the silver medal in second place. She was leading going into the final event, the run/shoot discipline, but was overtaken by Lena Schoneborn, the reigning Olympic champion. She entered the 2012 World Modern Pentathlon Championships ranked in 5th place in the world rankings. She achieved the gold medal position coming from 37 seconds behind the leader in the final discipline, becoming the first British woman to win the individual gold at the Pentathlon World Championships since Steph Cook in 2001. That result, combined with the bronze medal won by Samantha Murray and a 15th-place finish by Heather Fell resulted in the three athletes also winning the women's team gold medal as well. Following her gold medal at the 2012 World Championships, she was considered one of the favourites to be chosen for one of the two spots for the women's Pentathlon in the British team for the 2012 Summer Olympics along with Samantha Murray. Due to her placing at the Championships, she was deemed to have met the minimum standard required to compete at the Games, along with Murray and Freyja Prentice who qualified at the 2011 European Championships. She has described qualifying for an Olympic Games as a lifelong dream, saying \\"When I think about it I get goosebumps. I feel quite emotional about the idea of hopefully standing on that start line.\\" Prior to the 2012 Summer Olympics, she is ranked 4th in the world, the highest-ranked British athlete. Her selection as part of the British team at the 2012 Games was announced on 8 June. Personal life She has an ambition to be the host of the BBC One sports quiz show A Question of Sport.

Though initially studied as a potential treatment for a variety of different medical conditions, Sanofi-Aventis eventually narrowed down the therapeutic indications of the compound to just appetite suppression. Drinabant reached phase IIb clinical trials for this purpose in the treatment of obesity but was shortly thereafter discontinued, likely due to the observation of severe psychiatric side effects including anxiety, depression, and thoughts of suicide in patients treated with the now- withdrawn rimonabant, another CB1 antagonist that was also under development by Sanofi-Aventis. In late 2018, the drug was licensed by Opiant Pharmaceuticals, which intends to develop it for the treatment of acute cannabinoid overdose (ACO) as an injectable for administration in an emergency department setting. Opiant claims that ACO is most frequently linked to the ingestion of edibles containing large quantities THC and synthetic cannabinoids that are more potent and less expensive than marijuana. Edibles, sold as brownies, cookies and candies, pose particular risks for children, who often consume these by accident. There are currently no approved treatments for ACO.

He advocated a life course approach to understanding human experience and subjectivity, drawing on insights from psychoanalysis, developmental psychology, personology, psychological anthropology, narrative studies, and the interdisciplinary field of human development.Bertaux, D., and M. Kohli (1984) The Life Story Approach: A Continental View. Annual Review of Sociology, 10: 215-237. Cohler authored or co-authored over 200 articles and books. He contributed to numerous scholarly fields, including the study of adversity, resilience and coping; mental illness and treatment; family and social relations in normal development and mental illness; and the study of personal narrative in social and historical context. He made particular contributions to the study of sexual identity over the life course,van Eeden- Moorefield, Brad (2010) Review of The story of sexual identity: Narrative perspectives on the gay and lesbian life course.

Other than his graduate study at Harvard, Cohler spent his career at the University of Chicago and affiliated institutions, where he was repeatedly recognized as an educator and a builder of bridges across disciplines. He was treated for esophageal cancer in 2011, but became ill from a related pneumonia and died on 9 May 2012 not far from his home in Hyde Park, Chicago. Early life and education Bertram \\"Bert\\" Joseph Cohler was born in Chicago on 3 December 1938 to Theresa Belle \\"Betty\\" Cohler (n√©e Cahn) and Jonas Robert Cohler.Obituary: Bertram Joseph Cohler, from Tributes.com His siblings were Jonas Robert Cohler Jr., and Betsy Cohler.Obituary: Jonas Robert Cohler, Jr., from the Chicago Tribune, 2011 From the age of 10 to 17 years old, he was a student at the Orthogenic School, a residential treatment center for children with emotional disturbances run by Bruno Bettelheim; Bert Cohler lived in the Pirates Dormitory with 7 other boys. Dean Robert Hess Koff PhD of Washington University in St. Louis was in the Pirates dorm when Bert arrived. Sandy Lewis, aka Salim Bonnor Lewis, founding managing partner of S B Lewis & Company in Wall Street, now of Lewis Family Farm, Essex, New York, was in the Pirates dorm for one month as Cohler matriculated. Koff and Lewis and numerous other Orthogenic students worked for Bettelheim at The Orthogenic School after graduating. Koff and Lewis were asked by Bettelheim to run The School. Years apart, Lewis and Cohler attended U-High, The Laboratory School of The University of Chicago, while living at The Orthogenic School. Lewis was present and visited with Cohler at The Orthogenic School in the last week of Cohler's tenure as director. Lewis was a donor in support of Bettelheim and in support of the director that followed Cohler, Jacqueline Seevak Sanders PhD. Sanders was a counselor at The School in 1952 when Cohler, Koff and Lewis were enrolled. Barbara A. Lisco was co-counselor with Jacqui Seevak in 1956-7. In 1960 Lisco married Lewis. In 1963-4 Lewis became Seevak's co-counselor. Cohler became The School's director as Bettelheim retired the first time, and was celebrated as one of its most successful graduates.The Strange Case of Dr. B, from the New York Review of Books, 27 Feb 2003 Cohler received his A.B. in Human Development from the University of Chicago in 1961. He then studied at Harvard University in the Department of Social Relations, an interdisciplinary collaboration among the departments of psychology, sociology, and anthropology. As a graduate student he assisted with coding and analysis of data from the Six Cultures Study under John and Beatrice Whiting. In 1964-5 he served as a teaching fellow with Gordon Allport for the course, Theories of Personality, and in 1967-9 was a lecturer in clinical psychology and shared responsibility for instruction of psychiatric residents in social psychiatry with Elliot G. Mishler. Among his major influences at Harvard, Cohler counted personality psychologists Gordon Allport and Henry A. Murray, and narrative psychologist Elliott Mishler. He received his Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard in 1967. His dissertation was titled \\"Character, Psychopathology, and Child Rearing Attitudes in Hospitalized and Non-Hospitalized Mothers of Young Children\\" (committee members: Justin L. Weiss, chair; Arthur S. Couch, Beatrice B. Whiting). Cohler returned to Chicago in 1969, where he trained in child and adult psychoanalysis at the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. Educator, clinician, administrator In 1969, Cohler became an Assistant Professor at the University of Chicago and began working at the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School. While Bruno Bettelheim was on leave in the early 1970s, Cohler served as director for several months.Solving The Puzzle That Was Bruno Bettelheim, from the Chicago Tribune, 1990 In 1974, Cohler was promoted to Associate Professor at the University of Chicago, and in 1981 he was made full Professor. He was named William Rainey Harper Professor in Comparative Human Development and the College, with affiliations in the Department of Comparative Human Development, the Department of Psychology, and the Department of Psychiatry. He remained at the University of Chicago for the rest of his career. During the course of his prolific teaching career Cohler taught in the departments of Human Development, Psychology, Psychiatry and Education, in the Graham School, and in the undergraduate College. Cohler was a strong advocate of undergraduate education at the University. For most of his career he taught in and served as chairman of the year-long Social Sciences core sequence of courses, Self, Culture and Society, in the College. He famously stated \\"I like all my students to call me by my first name, because we're in seminar together and I want to emphasize that we're all equal before the texts.\\" Cohler won multiple teaching awards, including the Quantrell AwardMacAloon, John J., Ed. (1992) General education in the social sciences: Centennial reflections on the college of the University of Chicago. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Pp: 143-146. for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 1972 and 1999 and the Norman Maclean Faculty Award for enriching student life in 2006.Obituary: Bertram Cohler, from the University of Chicago Maroon, 2012 Cohler was a practicing clinical psychologist and certified in psychoanalysis by the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. He provided pro bono psychotherapy in private practice and through the Center on Halsted. His clinical work with patients of all ages informed his scholarly work on the life course, psychoanalysis, and identity work of LGBT individuals.Cohler, B. J. and R. M. Galatzer-Levy (2000). The course of gay and lesbian lives: social and psychoanalytic perspectives. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. ; .Cohler, B. J. (2007). Writing desire: sixty years of gay autobiography. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press. ; . Cohler served on the first steering committee of Division 39 (the Division of Psychoanalysis) of the American Psychological Association.Chicago Center for Psychoanalysis: History The APA awarded him the Henry A. Murray Award in personality psychology in 2007 http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/sage/call-for- nominations-for-the-henry-a-murray-award-5DUsrUVvf8 Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin and the Theodore Sarbin Award in recognition of distinguished contributions to theoretical and philosophical psychology in 2011. Cohler was on the faculty of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis from 1991 until his death and taught in the Core Psychoanalytic Education Program, the Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy Program and in the Teacher Education Program. He also lectured at The Institute for Clinical Social Work in Chicago from 1997 until his death. Scholarly work In his research, Cohler attended to the evolution of identity and experience of self over the life span, with insights from psychoanalysis, particularly Heinz Kohut, and the psychological study of development including the work of Lev Vygotsky.Galatzer-Levy, R. M. and B. J. Cohler (1994). The essential other: a developmental psychology of the self. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press. Cohler made significant contributions across social science disciplines, bringing together ideas from life-course perspectives on human development (influenced especially by the work of Bernice Neugarten and Glen Elder) with psychoanalytic theory and narrative psychology and the personological study of lives. Cohler is credited as one of the early advocates of a narrative approach to the study of lives, with his widely cited article \\"Personal narrative and the life course.\\"Cohler, B. J. (1982). Personal narrative and the life course. In P. Baltes & O.G. Brim (Eds.), Life span development and behavior (Vol. 4, pp. 205-241). New York: Academic Press. In his later work, he turned his attention to ways in which people \\"make meanings of misfortune\\". He worked extensively on narrative analysis, informed by psychoanalytic insights, of the memoirs of men and women who were internees in the extermination camps of the Third Reich, and written at some point in the post- war period. He looked at the manner in which history and social change influenced how these life writers portrayed their experiences before, during, and following the terrible experiences in Auschwitz and other death camps.

Formulas Two very similar expressions for are in wide use in hydrology. Both have the form 1000\\\\frac{s-a}a ‚Ä∞ (‚Ä∞ = permil or parts per thousand) where s and a are the relative abundances of 15N in respectively the sample and the atmosphere. The difference is whether the relative abundance is with respect to all the nitrogen, i.e. 14N plus 15N, or just to 14N. Since the atmosphere is 99.6337% 14N and 0.3663% 15N, a is 0.003663 in the former case and 0.003663/0.996337 = 0.003676 in the latter. However s varies similarly; for example if in the sample 15N is 0.385% and 14N is 99.615%, s is 0.003850 in the former case and 0.00385/0.99615 = 0.003865 in the latter. The value of 1000\\\\frac{s-a}a is then 51.05‚Ä∞ in the former case and 51.38‚Ä∞ in the latter, an insignificant difference in practice given the typical range of -20 to 80 for . Applications One use of 15N is as a tracer to determine the path taken by fertilizers applied to anything from pots to landscapes. Fertilizer enriched in 15N to an extent significantly different from that prevailing in the soil (which may be different from the atmospheric standard a) is applied at a point and other points are then monitored for variations in . Another application is the assessment of human waste water discharge into bodies of water. The abundance of 15N is greater in human waste water than in natural water sources. Hence in benthic sediment gives an indication of the contribution of human waste to the total nitrogen in the sediment. Sediment cores analyzed for yield an historical record of such waste, with older samples at greater depths.

It can be found in shallow water in temperate parts of the west Pacific Ocean and is cultivated in China, Japan, and Korea for human consumption. It is known as maohan in China and mogai in Japan. Description Anadara subcrenata has a white or cream coloured, thick, oval shell and superficially resembles a cockle. The left valve is slightly more concave than the right one, and there are 31 to 35 deeply indented ribs. The thin brown periostracum layer that covers the shell flakes off in strands. When harvested for human consumption, the length of Anadara subcrenata is usually in the range . Distribution and habitat Anadara subcrenata is found around the coasts of Japan and South Korea, buried in soft sediments in the subtidal zone. It favours mud or muddy sand. Some authorities maintain that the larvae, known as spats, need some hard materials such as stones and shells on which to attach themselves by their byssal threads. Other authorities claim that the larvae do not need hard substrates on which to settle. Anadara subcrenata is tolerant of low salinities and favours waters in the range 29‚Äì32 ppt. While the larvae are planktonic, they have a preference for even lower salinities of between 24.6 and 30 ppt and tend to congregate in estuarine waters with this degree of salinity. The clam thrives in waters varying in temperature between 5 ¬∞C and 28 ¬∞C. It also tolerates the low dissolved oxygen levels of tidal waters sweeping in over mud flats. It may be aided in this by the haemoglobin and erythrocytes found in its blood. Biology Anadara subcrenata becomes mature at a length of about . Individual clams are either male or female and spawning takes place between June and September. Fertilisation is external and the larvae form part of the zooplankton, drifting with the currents. Anadara species do not have long siphons but normally lie in the sediment with their posterior end level with the surface or in a slight depression in the mud. The feeding habits of Anadara subcrenata have not been researched but are likely to be similar to those of the closely related Anadara granosa. That clam is thought to filter particles out of the water with its gills but also to feed on detritus and microorganisms in the sediment. This ability to live and feed in muddy substrates enables members of the genus Anadara to exploit a niche habitat that other bivalves tend to avoid. Predators that feed on Anadara subcrenata include the mallard, (Anas platyrhynchos), the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula), blue crabs (Portunus pelagicus), predatory snails and the common octopus. The newly settled larvae are preyed upon by the Japanese sea bass (Lateolabrax japonicus), eels and other fish as well as starfish, drills and blue crabs. Aquaculture Anadara subcrenata is a fast-growing species, attaining a length of about in one year and in two. It is cultured in shallow areas of water in South Korea Regional seafarming: Anadara subcrenata FAO. Retrieved 2012-05-13. and in Japan. The main spat collection centre in Japan is a very shallow lagoon with a muddy bottom, Nakanoume, in Shimane Prefecture. Specially designed, long collecting devices are made of wire and palm fibre and the spat settles on these over an attachment period of 3 to 4 days. The collectors, each of which may have nearly 100,000 spats settled on it, are transported to nursery beds where they are laid on bamboo poles. Here the spats continue to grow, relatively free from seabed predators. The large number of spats that fall off during transport are seeded on the substrate at the rate of 15,000 to 30,000 per square metre. Predation and other causes of mortality reduce these to 5,500 to 6,000 per square metre in 6 months. When the juveniles have grown to about long they are moved to beds reserved for adults, from whence they are harvested a year later. Consumption The clam, known as maohan () in Chinese, is considered a delicacy in China, especially the Shanghai region, where it is commonly eaten nearly raw after being boiled for a very short time. In 1988, an outbreak of hepatitis A in Shanghai was associated with the consumption of inadequately cooked Anadara subcrenata. 290,000 people were affected and there were 9 deaths. The Shanghai municipal government banned the sale of the clams after the outbreak.

Hate Media as a Crime against Humanity While the hate speech promoted by these type of media can be prosecuted differently under the national laws of several countries, because of its proven ability to contribute to and incite genocide the use of hate media in order to foment the cleansing of a particular national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part can be prosecuted under international law for incitement to genocide. Incitement to Genocide was declared a crime against humanity under the Nuremberg Trials.‚ÄúIncitement to Genocide in International Law‚Äù.

The Media and the Rwandan Genocide. Ed. Allan Thompson. New York, NY: Pluto Press, 2007. After the crimes committed in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda this definition was modified and a new definition was provided for the Rwandan tribunals. According to this definition hate media propaganda considered to be a crime against humanity must be involved in the direct and indirect incitement of genocide which \\"must be defined as directly provoking the perpetrator(s) to commit genocide, whether through speeches shouting or threats uttered in public spaces or at public gatherings or through the sale or dissemination of ... written material or printed matter ... or through the public display of placards or posters, or through another means of audiovisual communication\\".  Radio Televizija Srbije (RTS1) and War in Yugoslavia  During the Yugoslav Wars, propaganda was widely used in the medias of all sides, including Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, to a lesser extent, Croatia. In the ICTY, one of the indictments against late Serbian leader Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, was his use of the Serbian state-run mass-media to create an atmosphere of fear and hatred among Yugoslavia's Orthodox Serbs by spreading \\"exaggerated and false messages of ethnically based attacks by Bosnian Muslims and Catholic Croats against the Serb people...\\" = Propaganda as part of the indictment against Milo≈°eviƒá = Two members of the Federal Security Service (KOG) testified for the Prosecution in Milosevic's trial about their involvement in Milo≈°eviƒá's propaganda campaign. Slobodan Lazareviƒá revealed alleged KOG clandestine activities designed to undermine the peace process, including mining a soccer field, a water tower and the reopened railway between Zagreb and Belgrade. These actions were blamed on Croats. Mustafa Candiƒá, one of four assistant chiefs of KOG, described the use of technology to fabricate conversations, making it sound as if Croat authorities were telling Croats in Serbia to leave for an ethnically pure Croatia. The conversation was broadcast following a Serb attack on Croatians living in Serbia, forcing them to flee. He testified to another instance of disinformation involving a television broadcast of corpses, described as Serb civilians killed by Croats. Candiƒá testified that he believed they were in fact the bodies of Croats killed by Serbs, though this statement has not been verified. He also corroborated the existence of Operations Opera and Labrador.EXPERT REPORT OF RENAUD DE LA BROSSE \\"Political Propaganda and the Plan to Create 'A State For All Serbs:' Consequences of using media for ultra-nationalist ends\\" in five parts 1 2 3 4 5Yugoslav Army's Central Intelligence Unit: Clandestine Operations Foment War = Propaganda as a war crime in the ≈†e≈°elj's case = Propaganda as a war crime (incitement to genocide) is the subject in the recent indictment of Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj, the head of the Serbian Radical Party and an active player throughout the wars in the former Yugoslavia.

He is best known for episodes of violence culminating in his death in a duel at the hands of the playwright Ben Jonson. Acting career Spenser appears in a number of documents as an actor associated with two of the major theatre companies of the day. Spenser first appears in records working for Francis Langley, in the Earl of Pembroke's Men, though he may have already been working for the Lord Chamberlain's Men.Alan Palmer, Veronica Palmer, Who's Who in Shakespeare, Palgrave Macmillan, 1999, p. 238. The stage direction \\"enter Gabriel\\" in the First Folio version of Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3 has often been thought to refer to Spenser's role in the play ‚Äî that of a messenger.Scott McMillin, \\"Casting for Pembroke's Men: The Henry VI Quartos and The Taming of A Shrew\\", Shakespeare Quarterly, Vol. 23, No. 2, Spring, 1972, pp. 141-159. The names of actors are sometimes accidentally substituted for roles in published versions of plays. It has also been suggested that Spenser was the actor responsible for the so-called bad quarto of Romeo and Juliet published in 1597, if it was a memorial reconstruction.A Shakespeare Encyclopaedia, Taylor & Francis, p. 818. In July 1597 Spenser was imprisoned after performing in The Isle of Dogs, an allegedly seditious play co-written by Ben Jonson and Thomas Nashe. It is not known why only Spenser and one other actor, Robert Shaw, were imprisoned, along with Jonson (Nashe fled London). The report of their arrest says that \\"the rest of the players or actors in that matter shall be apprehended\\", but no one else ever was. He was released after eight weeks. In November of that year Spenser left the Earl of Pembroke's Men to join Philip Henslowe's company the Admiral's Men. Spenser joined as a shareholder, entitling him to a portion of the daily takings. Langley sued Spenser for breach of contract. In March 1598 Spenser appears in a document as a witness to a contract drawn up between Henslowe and Thomas Heywood.H. Baldwin, Historical account of the English stage. Emendations and additions, 1790, p. 311. Killing of Feake Ben Jonson, Spenser's killer. In December 1596, while still a member of Langley's company, Spenser got into an argument with James Feake, the son of a goldsmith, at the house of a Shoreditch barber. It culminated with Spenser stabbing Feake with his sword, mortally wounding him. According to the inquest, the argument had escalated to the point that Feake attempted to throw a copper candelabrum at Spenser, who responded by attacking him with his still-sheathed sword, which penetrated his eye and entered his brain. Feake languished for three days before he died. There is no record of any punishment meted out to Spenser, who may have successfully argued self-defence.C.C. Stopes, Burbage and Shakespeare's Stage, Ardent, 2010, p. 71-73. Death On 22 September 1598, Spenser fought a duel with Ben Jonson on Hoxton fields. The cause of the duel is not known. According to Jonson's account, related many years later, Spenser had initiated the duel and had the advantage of a much longer sword. Spenser wounded Jonson in the arm, but Jonson managed to strike back, killing him. The inquest says he died from a six-inch deep stab wound in his right side.Helen Ostovich, Holger Schott Syme, Andrew Griffin, Locating the Queen's Men, 1583-1603: Material Practices and Conditions of Playing, Ashgate Publishing, 2009, p. 91. Jonson confessed to the killing, but escaped capital punishment by pleading benefit of clergy. He was sentenced to be branded on the thumb.From the time of Henry VII, branding was inflicted for all offences which received Benefit of clergy. Branding of the thumbs was used to ensure that the accused who had successfully exercised this privilege could not use it more than once. During his imprisonment he converted to Roman Catholicism. Henslowe appears to have been very angry with Jonson and refused to produce his next play. It has been suggested that Jonson's many enemies never subsequently taunted him as the murderer of Spenser because the latter was widely believed to have deserved his fate. However, Heywood appears to praise Spenser in his Apology for Actors, listing him with other deceased actors whose \\"deserts yet live in the remembrance of many\\".Herbert Berry, English Professional Theatre, 1530-1660, Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 176-7. Spenser was buried in St Leonard's, Shoreditch, which is also the resting place of several other Elizabethan actors. A memorial plaque was put up in 1913 by the London Shakespeare League to commemorate him and the others who rest there.Andrew Davies, Literary London, Macmillan, 1988, p. 198.

History The settlement at Plymouth Meeting was founded by a group of Devonshire Quakers who arrived in Pennsylvania in 1686. The Maulsby family, who later attained prominence, arrived in Pennsylvania in 1698, and came to Whitemarsh Township in 1705.Ella K. Barnard, Early Maltby, with Some Roades History, and That of the Maulsby Family in America (Baltimore: Ella K. Barnard, 1909). =Maulsby= 1767 deed and groundplan Maulsby Barn (built c.1795) Plymouth Meeting General Store and Post Office (built c.1826-27). Merchant Maulsby Jr. (1737-1772) was a millwright, who married Hannah Davis (1743-1807) in 1766. On June 20, 1767, he purchased a 100-acre farm with frontage on the \\"Whitemarsh great road\\" (Germantown Pike) and the \\"Plymouth line\\" (Butler Pike), for ¬£651. The purchase did not include the 8.25-acre plot at the northeast corner of Germantown and Butler Pikes, which the 1767 deed described as \\"Elizabeth and Catherine Ellis's Land.\\" He and his wife built a 2-story stone house on the property. They had two children - Samuel (1768-1838)Maulsby-Albertson Family Papers, from Swarthmore College. and Elizabeth (married John Freese). In 1769, Merchant Jr. was taxed ¬£10 on 100 acres, one horse and one cow.Pennsylvania Archives Tax Lists - 1769, quoted in Barnard, p. 145. He died in February 1772 at age 34. In the early morning of May 20, 1778, 10-year-old Samuel Maulsby watched as British troops marched down Butler Pike to the meetinghouse, part of their unsuccessful attempt to surround the Marquis de Lafayette and 2,100 Continental troops at the Battle of Barren Hill. Maulsby's recollections were recorded by John Fanning Watson in his Annals of Philadelphia (1830), including his description of Redcoats looting his widowed mother's house.John Fanning Watson, Annals of Philadelphia, Volume 2 (Philadelphia: 1830), pp. 61-62. Widow Hannah Davis Maulsby married David Marple in 1781, and was soon widowed again.Cora M. Payne, Genealogy of the Maulsby Family for Five Generations (Des Moines, IA: George A. Miller Press, 1902). She married Richard Corson in 1784, with whom she had two children, Richard and Hannah. The Corsons occupied her 2-story stone house for a time, but settled in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Samuel Dean was farming the Maulsby property in 1781; Enoch Marple was farming it in 1783; and seventeen-year-old Samuel Maulsby and his former schoolmate Joseph Corson, a nephew of Richard Corson, were farming it in 1785. Joseph Corson married Hannah Dickinson in 1786, and the young couple rented the 2-story stone house until 1789. Like Samuel Maulsby, they became abolitionists, and decades later one of their sons would marry one of his daughters. On 3 February 1794, Samuel Maulsby purchased the 8.25-acre plot at the northeast corner of Germantown and Butler Pikes, for ¬£137.Norristown Deed Book #9, page 180, transcription in Barnard, p. 146. The sellers were John Fontiles and his wife Elizabeth, who had bought the corner plot from Joseph and Mary Potts on February 2, 1789. The 1794 deed mentioned \\"a messuage\\" (house) on the property, but did not describe it. Maulsby later purchased adjacent plots at the north end of the farm, which expanded it to 128 acres (51.8 hectares) and extended it to Flourtown Road. > Samuel Maulsby was the owner of a large and fertile farm at Plymouth > Meeting... It included the whole north east corner of the two roads, the > Germantown turnpike, its south boundary, and the Plymouth and Broad Axe > turnpike, along which it extended for half a mile, its western boundary. > [I]n addition to the farming operations the burning of lime was extensively > carried on by him. About 1795, he built a 3-story, 14-room, Federal-style dwelling on the corner, diagonally opposite the meetinghouse. An earlier stone house seems to have been incorporated into his new house. Maulsby built the stone barn, perhaps around the same time,Hovenden House, Barn and Abolition Hall, from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. and is presumed to have built the carriage shed. In 1799, he married Susanna Thomas (1780-1818), and they had seven children.Ellwood Roberts, Plymouth Meeting: Its Establishment, and The Settlement Of The Township, (Norristown, PA: Roberts Publishing Company, 1900). Maulsby built or altered the Cater Corner House (1802), at the southeast corner of Butler Pike and Flourtown Road, possibly as housing for Thomas Davis, a free-black limeburner recorded as living on his property. Note: This includes At 3-5 Germantown Pike, just east of his house, Maulsby built the Plymouth Meeting General Store and Post Office (1826-27). His son Jonathan (1801-1845) ran the store and served as Plymouth Meeting's first postmaster.Maulsby-Albertson Family Papers, 1763-1884, RG 5/099, Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. In 1832, Maulsby's daughter Martha (1807-1870) married George Corson (1803-1860), a son of Joseph and Hannah Corson, and a former clerk in the general store.Hiram Corson, M.D. \\"George Corson,\\" The Corson Family: A History of the Descendants of Benjamin Corson, Son of Cornelius Corssen of Staten Island, New York.

George and Martha Maulsby Corson purchased the farm from his estate on April 6, 1839.Norristown Deeds Book 66, page 341.

Away back > before 1820 they had been stirred by the scathing denunciations of slavery, > and the horrors of the slave trade, made by Granville Sharp, William > Wilberforce and Thomas Fouell Buxton, before the Parliament of Great > Britain, to an intense hatred of slavery and the slave trade, and the > abominations of slavery in our own country. Maulsby and the Corsons co-founded the Plymouth Meeting Anti-Slavery Society in 1831, which initially had seven members and met at the Plymouth Friends Meeting House. They also co-founded the Montgomery County Anti-Slavery Society in 1837, which initially had about twenty members and met at various locations in Norristown.Hiram Corson, M.D., \\"The Norristown Group,\\" The Abolitionists of Montgomery County, (Norristown, PA: Historical Society of Montgomery County, 1900), pp. 29-36. Frederick Douglass, former-slave and abolitionist, was the keynote speaker at an August 1847 anti-slavery convention held at the First Baptist Church of Norristown. His lecture was disrupted by about sixty ruffians standing outside and pelting the church's windows with rocks. A plot to abduct and lynch Douglass was thwarted.Charles Waddell Chesnutt, Frederick Douglass, (Boston: Small, Maynard & Company, 1899), p. 18. Both George Corson's and Martha Maulsby's parents had sheltered escaped slaves. But it was the couple's close friendship with Benjamin Lundy - publisher of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society's weekly newspaper, The National Enquirer (1836‚Äì38) - that inspired them to fully engage in the cause. They turned their property into a major station on the Underground Railroad, providing food and shelter to hundreds of escaped slaves.Thomas Hovenden: American Painter of Hearth and Homeland, Woodmere Art Museum, Philadelphia, 1995. .

The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 increased the penalties for giving assistance to an escaped slave to six months in prison and a $1,000 fine. It allowed slavecatchers to pursue a fugitive across state lines into every U.S. state and territory. Corson was involved in hiding Jane Johnson, whose escape exposed a loophole in the federal law.Phil Lapsansky, \\"The Liberation of Jane Johnson,\\" The Library Company of Philadelphia, 2003. Jane Johnson left left William Still On the morning of July 18, 1855, Jane Johnson (1822-1872) and her two young sons, Daniel and Isaiah, arrived in Philadelphia by train with their master, North Carolina slaveholder John H. Wheeler, and his wife and three children.Jane Johnson, from American National Biography. Wheeler was U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua, and they were en route from Washington, D.C. to New York City, from which they would board a ship to return to Central America. At Philadelphia, they had to switch to a ferry to cross the Delaware River. Wheeler locked Johnson and her sons in a hotel room while he and his family took the afternoon to tour the city. Pennsylvania had begun an abolition of slavery in 1780, completed in 1847, and did not recognize the property rights of any slaveholder. Johnson sought help from a hotel porter in escaping to freedom. The porter contacted abolitionist William Still, the son of former slaves, and Still and lawyer Passmore Williamson rushed to the docks as the 5:00 pm ferry was about to depart for Camden, New Jersey. They found Johnson and her sons with their master on the ferry's upper deck. Williamson approached her and explained that Pennsylvania law guaranteed her freedom, if she chose it: As Still led Johnson and her sons away, five black dockhands prevented Wheeler from stopping them. Williamson remained to explain to authorities that this had been a lawful act, not a kidnapping. Williamson, the only white man involved, was arrested and charged with violating the Fugitive Slave Act. Federal Judge John Kintzing Kane presided over his trial, and refused to believe that Williamson did not know where Johnson was being hidden. Kane found him in contempt of court, and jailed him for more than three months, which attracted national attention. Williamson's successful defense was that Johnson's master had brought her into Pennsylvania, a free state, therefore she was not a fugitive _across state lines_ , and state law rather than federal law applied.Narrative of the Facts of the Case of Passmore Williamson (1855), from Library Company of Philadelphia. Still and the five dockhands were charged with forcible abduction, rioting, disorderly conduct, and assault. On August 29, 1855, Johnson appeared as a surprise witness at their trial, and testified that she had voluntarily walked away from Wheeler. The most serious charges against the men were dismissed, although the two who had restrained Wheeler were convicted of assault and spent a week in jail. Johnson was escorted out of the courthouse by Lucretia Mott, Rev. James Miller McKim and George Corson.William Still, The Underground Rail Road (Philadelphia: Porter & Coates, 1872). She was hidden at Corson's house in Plymouth Meeting to prevent pro-slavery activists from abducting her and returning her to slavery. At the end of her stay, Corson's 13-year-old son, Ellwood, drove Johnson in a carriage by night to Mahlon Linton's house in Newtown, Pennsylvania. From there she was smuggled to Boston, Massachusetts and reunited with her sons. Abolition Hall Abolition Hall (built 1856), left, and Maulsby Barn, right, c.1906. The Jane Johnson affair caused a national controversy--largely cheered in the North, viciously condemned in the South. The Plymouth Friends Meeting had permitted the anti-slavery society to use its meeting house for more than two decades, but, following the suspicious burning of a church that had hosted abolitionist speakers, in 1856 permission was denied for the first time.Anne Gregory Terhune et al., Thomas Hovenden, His Life and Art, (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2013), p. 101. George Corson's reaction was to built a lecture hall above his carriage shed to provide a space for abolitionist meetings. > He determined to build a hall, over which he could have control. He made > quite a large one and furnished it well with seats, warmed and lighted at > his own expense. And now we can see how convenient it was for the lecturers > to make his house their temporary home. As time wore on more and more > neighbors and friends were attracted to the meetings to hear the eloquent > and earnest men and women who pictured the atrocities of slavery.Theodore > Weber Bean, \\"The Corson Family,\\" History of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, > Volume 2, (Unigraphic, 1884), pp. 1036-37. Abolition Hall could hold up to 200 people, and provided a meeting hall for the Plymouth Meeting Anti-Slavery Society and for lectures by prominent abolitionists, including Frederick Douglass,Melia Bowie, \\"Historical marker for a carriage shed called Abolition Hall,\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer, December 10, 2000. Harriet Beecher Stowe, William Lloyd Garrison and Lucretia Mott. Corson died in November 1860. William Still eulogized Corson in his 1872 history of the Underground Railroad: > There were perhaps few more devoted men than George Corson to the interests > of the oppressed everywhere. The slave, fleeing from his master, ever found > a home with him, and felt while there that no slave-hunter would get him > away until every means of protection should fail. He was ever ready to send > his horse and carriage to convey them on the road to Canada, or elsewhere > toward freedom. His home was always open to entertain the anti-slavery > advocates, and being warmly supported in the cause by his excellent wife, > everything which they could do to make their guests comfortable was done. It > is to be regretted that he died before the emancipation of the slaves, which > he had so long labored for, arrived.William Still, The Underground Rail Road > (Philadelphia: Porter & Coates, 1872), p. 721. =Artist's studio= The Last Moments of John Brown (1882‚Äì84) by Thomas Hovenden, Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Corsons' daughter Helen (1846-1935), trained as an artist at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. She further studied in Paris, and exhibited at the Paris Salon, 1876, 1879 and 1880.\\"Helen Corson Hovenden,\\" from Art Price. She met Irish-born painter Thomas Hovenden (1840-1895) in France, and they were married at the Plymouth Friends Meeting House on June 9, 1881. They moved into her late parents' house, and raised two children, Thomas Jr. and Martha. Hovenden succeeded Thomas Eakins as Professor of Painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1886.\\"Thomas Hovenden, 1840 - 1895,\\" from National Academy of Design. He specialized in genre scenes of rural life, using his neighbors, often African Americans, as models. He converted Abolition Hall into a studio, and the moral causes that had been championed there inspired some of his works.Lee M. Edwards, \\"Noble Domesticity: The Paintings of Thomas Hovenden,\\" American Art Journal:19 (1987): 5-38. His most famous painting - The Last Moments of John Brown (1882‚Äì84), Metropolitan Museum of Art - depicts the radical abolitionist John Brown kissing a baby as he is led to the gallows. Hovenden was elected a member of the National Academy of Design in 1881, and an academician in 1882. \\"Thomas Hovenden lost his life on an unguarded grade crossing of the Pennsylvania Railroad near his home, August 14, 1895, in an attempt to save the life of a little girl who was crossing in front of an approaching engine. Both were killed.\\"Helen Corson Hovenden, \\"Thomas Hovenden,\\" Historical Sketches: A collection of papers prepared for the Historical Society of Montgomery County, Volume 4, (Norristown, PA: Historical Society of Montgomery County, ), p. 5. The accident occurred about three miles from his house, near the south end of what is now Chemical Road. Helen Corson Hovenden's advocacy pressured the Pennsylvania Railroad into elevating the tracks of its high- speed Trenton Cutoff, separating them from the grade level tracks of trolleys. Rev. William Henry Furness gave the eulogy at Thomas Hovenden's funeral, and Eakins and sculptor Samuel Murray were among the pall bearers.Ernest Pfattiecher, \\"Thomas Hovenden,\\" The Book News Monthly, vol. 5, no. 25 (January 1907), p. 305. Helen Corson Hovenden was noted for her portraits of children and pets.Martha Hovenden and Her Dog (1888), from Woodmere Art Museum. The couple's daughter, Martha Maulsby Hovenden (1884-1941), a sculptor who trained at PAFA under Charles Grafly and at the Art Students League of New York under Hermon Atkins MacNeil,American Numismatic Society, \\"Martha M. Hovenden,\\" Catalogue of the International Exhibition of Contemporary Medals (De Vinne Press, 1911), p. 140. later used Abolition Hall as her studio. Examples of her work can be seen at the Washington Memorial Chapel in Valley Forge. In 1939, she designed a bookplate, which is still in use by the Friends of the William Jeanes Memorial Library. In October 2016, the Friends of the Library donated the original etched copper printing plate to the Woodmere Art Museum in nearby Chestnut Hill. Nancy Corson (1920-2012), a great-granddaughter of George Corson and granddaughter of Dr. Ellwood M. Corson (the teenager who had assisted Jane Johnson in 1855), made the Maulsby stone barn her residence from 1946 until her death in 2012. Plymouth Meeting Historic District thumb The village of Plymouth Meeting was designated a Pennsylvania historic district in 1961, by a joint resolution of Plymouth and Whitemarsh Townships. The district encompassed 66 historic structures. In 1971, the village of Plymouth Meeting became Pennsylvania's first National Register District. At the time, the Maulsby/Corson/Hovenden homestead was threatened by a plan to split Butler Pike into two one-way highways that would straddle the buildings on the property. The northbound bypass would have run alongside the east wall of the barn, and required the demolition of Abolition Hall. Nancy Corson authored a separate NRHP nomination specifically for the Hovenden House, Barn and Abolition Hall as a unit, which was also approved in 1971. Plans for the bypass were abandoned. =Historical marker= Nancy Corson and Charles L. Blockson, an authority on the history of the Underground Railroad, co-wrote the nomination for a Pennsylvania state historical marker to commemorate Abolition Hall. The marker was approved, and dedicated at 4006 Butler Pike (in front of the barn) on November 18, 2000:\\"Abolition Hall (Thomas Hovenden) Historical Marker,\\" from Explore PA History. NOTE: The article gets some of the dates wrong, and mistakes the barn for the carriage house.

The plan included the re-routing of Butler Pike between the Hovenden House and the Barn/Abolition Hall.Sydelle Zove, \\"Underground Railroad site threatened,\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer, April 20, 2016.

Following vocal opposition, the Whitemarsh Township Board of Supervisors unanimously voted to deny the request for a zoning variance. In response, the developer requested a continuance of a scheduled April 25, 2016 zoning hearing.Michael Bixler, \\"Historic estate and Underground Railroad station under threat in Plymouth Meeting,\\" Hidden City Philadelphia, April 20, 2016. In late August 2016, K. Hovnanian Builders submitted a revised Zoning Plan to Whitemarsh Township, asserting that this plan met the requirements for shared parking and access (with an adjacent property). In early November 2016, the Zoning Officer issued his Preliminary Opinion, concurring with the developer's assertion that the current Zoning Plan met the requirements of the code. With the second publication of this opinion, a 30-day period begins during which any \\"aggrieved\\" party can file an appeal. Absent such appeal, the Zoning Officer's opinion becomes binding.http://dced.pa.gov/download/pennsylvania-municipalities-planning-code- act-247-of-1968/#.WBQJvy0rKpo (See Section 916.2--Preliminary Opinion of the Zoning Officer). On December 21, 2016, seven concerned Whitemarsh Township residents, represented by counsel, filed an appeal, challenging the Zoning Officer's Preliminary Opinion. On January 31, that appeal was heard before the Whitemarsh Township Zoning Hearing Board, but after three hours of testimony and questions, the hearing was continued to March 16, 2017. On February 15, the attorney for the appellants submitted a legal brief, further supporting the challenge to the Preliminary Opinion. =Advocacy= Friends of Abolition Hall Rally, 29 January 2017.

Its distinctive feature is the arrangement of the lower stretcher between the legs as a double-ended Y-shape. The shape of each end, and their joinery, was based on traditional English craft woodworking and the construction of wooden hay rakes. The stretcher is not merely a simple Y shape, but its junction is braced by a T-shaped joint, as was needed for the work of a rake. Some modern reproductions simplify this to a plain Y, abandoning the design's original roots. These tables are best known as the work of Ernest Gimson and his associates the Barnsley brothers and Peter Waals at their Daneway workshops in Sapperton, Gloucestershire. Other Arts and Crafts designers of the period also produced them, particularly those in the Cotswolds such as Gordon Russell Timber used in their construction was, as for other Arts and Crafts work, locally grown English hardwoods. Most were produced in oak although some, like the original hay rakes, were made in ash. The design varies between makers, mostly in its details. Gimson's tables are considered the finest and the canonical example of the design. Their edges are heavily chamfered, a typically Gimson feature, which is derived from the finishing of the original agricultural tools. This chamfer also has the practical benefit for a table stretcher of reduced wear from feet on an otherwise sharp edge. Gimson's distinctive use of gentle stopped chamfers evokes the framing of Gloucestershire wagons. Gimson's tables also have their edges finished with bands of chip carving or sometimes with inlaid bands of light holly and dark bog oak. Peter Waals produced the tables for some time after the death of Gimson and, as with many of his pieces, updated their Arts and Crafts detailing to follow the post-war fashions of Modernism and Art Deco. Although less well-known than some other iconic Arts and Crafts pieces, the hayrake table remains a popular design to this day. They are produced both commercially and as plans for hobbyists.

The school was instituted in 1792, with the aim of maintaining the daughters of indigent Freemasons, unable through death, illness, or incapacitation to support their families. History In 1788 Bartholomew Ruspini and nine fellow Freemasons met in London to discuss plans for establishing a charitable institution for the daughters of Masons who had fallen on hard times or whose death had meant hardship for their families. In 1790 several Irish Brethren met together and made themselves responsible for the school fees for girls. In 1792, a small house, affording accommodation for twenty girls, was taken in Dublin where the pupils were boarded. clothed and educated until such time as they could earn their own living. The children had to be between the ages of six and ten and retained until they reached the age of fifteen and had to be the daughters of freemasons. At the end of their school life, girls were either returned to their family or supporters (known as Friends) or apprenticed and supported until they could establish themselves.Encyclopedia of Freemasonry Masonic orphans school bazaar in Dublin, 1882 In 1852, after several removals, Burlington House in Burlington Place, Ballsbridge, was opened.

The temple also has many other deities. History One Mr. Kunjukrishnan cleared a small piece of land at 832, Sembawang Road in 1962, placed several shrines / deities and started praying. Taxi drivers congregated in the area for relaxation. After the death of Mr. Kunjukrishnan, Mr. Velayutham further cleared the area and brought in more deities. As the time passed by, the Temple was named ‚ÄúSri Siva-Krishna Temple‚Äù. With more and more devotees and revenue coming to the Temple, it was suggested that the surroundings of the Temple be kept clean so as to give the Temple a dignified look. In 1982, the Temple was shifted to the present site at Marsiling Rise. The land area is about 25000 Square feet. Various committees took care of the temple from 1982 to 1987. In 1987, a new committee took charge of the temple and immediately performed the ground breaking ceremony.

Dewart Lake is a 551-acre (223 ha) natural lake, located three miles (4.8 km) south of Syracuse and three miles (4.8 km) east of Indiana State Road 15. 41 degrees 22' 03.31\\" North Latitude x 85 degrees 46' 18.22\\" West Longitude, above Sea Level. is the maximum depth with an average depth of . It lies within the Elkhart River watershed and drains . Two small inlets enter on the east side and the outlet, Hammond Ditch, leaves the west side and flows to Waubee Lake. Large areas on the north and south sides of the lake are less than deep. Hydraulic retention time is 601 days. Farming is the main watershed use, although woodlots and wetlands are present. Nearly all of the shoreline is residentially developed. Areas of natural shoreline and wetlands are present along the south shore and in the northeast corner adjacent to a private camp. A state-owned boat ramp is available in the northwest corner on CR 300E. Dewart Lake is moderately fertile. Its trophic index is 36. Enough oxygen is present for fish 20 deep but levels drop too low below 20 feet (less than 4 ppm.). Water clarity varies from 6 through 13 1/2 feet. The bottom is mostly sand and muck, but boulders and gravel are also present. Eurasian Water Millfol is the dominant submerged aquatic plant. (The lake was treated for this non-indeginoous plant in 2006.) Cattails, spatterdock and water lilies are the major emergent plants. In recent years, an extensive cattail stand along the south shore has been replaced with lilies. Some past management at Dewart Lake has been directed at maintaining the native fishery and creating walleye fishing opportunities. A Short History of the Name of Dewart Lake =Originally Wa-We-As-See= Surveyor‚Äôs field notes dated February 21, 1835 describe our beautiful lake as ‚Äútwo square miles located in the southeast corner of Van Buren township known by the Indian name of Wa-we-as-see (pronounced Wawasee)‚Äù. =Then Lingle Lake= The land in northern Indiana was opened for settlement on March 20, 1837. Shortly thereafter, President Martin Van Buren granted a land patent of 77.53 acres that contained our lake to Thomas Lingle and his wife Matelene. Soon after this the lake was renamed Lingle Lake. Lingle‚Äôs land was located in the northwest corner of the lake in the vicinity of what is now road 300 E. Five years later the Lingles left Van Buren township and the state of Indiana to move further west to Iowa. Thomas Lingle and his wife signed a deed granting the land to Mr. Henry S. Goben in the presence of an Abner Andsmith, Justice of the Peace of Johnson County, Iowa for a sales price of $500. Seven months later Henry Goben sold the land to Edward and Susan Goben of Northumberland County, Pennsylvania for $750 thereby making a tidy profit of $250. =Finally Dewart Lake= Less than two years later Edward and Susan sold the acreage including our lake to another Northumberland County, Pennsylvania couple named Samuel and Margaret Dewart. The Dewarts purchased the land for $1200 on May 8, 1844. The Dewarts were 41 years old when they moved from Pennsylvania to Lingle Lake. The 1850 census lists eight children living in the Dewart household and all were born in Pennsylvania. The children listed were: Lewis, age 23; Amos, age 22; Simon, age 19; Samuel, age 15;William, age 13; John, age 11; Rueben, age 9; and Jessimen, age 8. Samuel Dewart only lived to enjoy his lake for nine years. He died September 8, 1853 at the young age of 50. His wife Margaret lived until September 22, 1877 and died at the age of 74. The gravestones of Samuel and Margaret Muir Dewart are located in Salem Cemetery at the northeast corner of 200 E and 900 N. The name Lingle Lake continued on some legal documents well into the early 1900s. Finally the Dewart name won out by an overwhelming majority and our lake became officially known as Dewart Lake.

The Parliament of India passed the 'Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Bill, 2011' regarding child sexual abuse on 22 May 2012 into an Act.The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 Kerala Medico-legal Society website The rules formulated by the government in accordance with the law have also been notified on the November 2012 and the law has become ready for implementation.Law for Protecting Children from Sexual Offences There have been many calls for more stringent laws. India has one of the largest population of children in the world - Census data from 2011 shows that India has a population of 472 million children below the age of eighteen. Protection of children by the state is guaranteed to Indian citizens by an expansive reading of Article 21 of the Indian constitution, and also mandated given India's status as signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Law Before the 2012 legislation was passed Goa Children's Act, 2003, was the only specific piece of child abuse legislation before the 2012 Act. Child sexual abuse was prosecuted under the following sections of Indian Penal Code: * I.P.C. (1860) 375- Rape * I.P.C. (1860) 354- Outraging the modesty of a woman * I.P.C. (1860) 377- Unnatural offences However, the IPC could not effectively protect the child due to various loopholes like: * IPC 375 doesn't protect male victims or anyone from sexual acts of penetration other than \\"traditional\\" peno-vaginal intercourse. * IPC 354 lacks a statutory definition of \\"modesty\\". It carries a weak penalty and is a compoundable offence. Further, it does not protect the \\"modesty\\" of a male child. * In IPC 377, the term \\"unnatural offences\\" is not defined. It only applies to victims penetrated by their attacker's sex act, and is not designed to criminalise sexual abuse of children. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act  = Offences under the Act = The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 was enacted to provide a robust legal framework for the protection of children from offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography, while safeguarding the interest of the child at every stage of the judicial process. The framing of the Act seeks to put children first by making it easy to use by including mechanisms for child-friendly reporting, recording of evidence, investigation and speedy trial of offences through designated Special Courts. The new ActThe Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 pdf provides for a variety of offences under which an accused can be punished. It recognises forms of penetration other than penile- vaginal penetrationThe Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 Chapter 2 and criminalises acts of immodesty against children too. Offences under the act include: * Penetrative Sexual Assault: Insertion of penis/object/another body part in child's vagina/urethra/anus/mouth, or asking the child to do so with them or some other person * Sexual Assault: When a person touches the child, or makes the child touch them or someone else * Sexual Harassment: passing sexually coloured remark, sexual gesture/noise, repeatedly following, flashing, etc. * Child Pornography * Aggravated Penetrative Sexual Assault/ Aggravated Sexual Assault The act is gender- neutral for both children and for the accused. With respect to pornography, the Act criminalises even watching or collection of pornographic content involving children.The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 Chapter 3 The Act makes abetment of child sexual abuse an offence.The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 Chapter 4 = Child- friendly process = It also provides for various procedural reforms,The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 Chapter 5The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 Chapter 6The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 Chapter 7The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 Chapter 8 making the tiring process of trial in India considerably easier for children. The Act has been criticised as its provisions seem to criminalise consensual sexual intercourse between two people below the age of 18. The 2001 version of the Bill did not punish consensual sexual activity if one or both partners were above 16 years. = Child Welfare Committee = A sexually abused child is considered as \\"child in need of care and protection\\" under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. http://cara.nic.in/PDF/JJ%20act%202015.pdf, Section 2(14) Police officer should therefore inform the Child Welfare Committee about every case under the Act within 24 hours. Section 19 CWC can appoint a support person for the child who will be responsible for psycho-social well- being of the child. This support person will also liaise with the police, and keep the child and child's family informed about progress in the case. Reporting can be done through toll free number 1098. http://ncpcr.gov.in/showfile.php?lang=1&level;=1&&sublinkid;=284&lid;=722 Rule 4(7) = Contention around implementation of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act =  Definition of child  The Act defines a child as a person under the age of 18 years. However, this definition is a purely biological one, and doesn't take into account people who live with intellectual and psycho-social disability. A recent case in SC has been filed where a women of biological age 38yrs but mental age 6yrs was raped. The victim's advocate argues that \\"failure to consider the mental age will be an attack on the very purpose of act.\\" SC held that the Parliament has felt it appropriate that the definition of the term ‚Äúage‚Äù by chronological age or biological age to be the safest yardstick than referring to a person having mental retardation. The court said while awarding maximum compensation to a rape victim of who is 38 years old with a mental maturity of 6 to 8 years but rejecting the plea that the victim's age should be taken not just in physical terms, but also take into account her mental age as well. The victim suffers from cerebral palsy.  Contradiction with the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971  The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act was passed to strengthen legal provisions for the protection of children below 18 years of age from sexual abuse and exploitation. Under this Act, if any girl under 18 is seeking abortion the service provider is compelled to register a complaint of sexual assault with the police. However, under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, it is not mandatory to report the identity of the person seeking an abortion. Consequently, service providers are hesitant to provide abortion services to girls under 18.  Mandatory Reporting  According to the Act, every crime of child sexual abuse should be reported. If a person who has information of any abuse fails to report, they may face imprisonment up to six months or may be fined or both. Section 20 Many child rights and women rights organisation has criticised this provision. According to experts, this provision takes away agency of choice from children. There may be many survivors who do not want to go through the trauma of criminal justice system, but this provision does not differentiate. Furthermore, mandatory reporting may also hinder access to medical aid, and psycho-social intervention. It contradicts the right to confidentiality for access to medical, and psychological care.  Legal Aid  Section 40 of the Act allows victims to access legal aid. However, that is subject to Code of Criminal Procedure. In other words, the lawyer representing a child can only assist the Public Prosecutor, and file written final arguments if the judge permits. Thus, the interest of the victim often go unrepresented.  Consent  The law presumes all sexual act with children under the age of 18 is sexual offence. Therefore, two adolescent who engage in consensual sexual act will also be punished under this law. This is especially a concern where adolescent is in relationship with someone from different caste, or religion.

Some cultures attach special symbolism to a threshold. It is called a door saddle in British English and in New England. Etymology Various popular false etymologies of this word exist, some of which were even recorded by dictionaries in the past and even created by early linguists before linguistics became a strictly scientific field. Some of these false etymologies date from the time of Old English or even earlier. Many different forms of this word are attested in Old English, which shows that the original meaning of this word and especially of its latter half was already obscure at the time and that most or all of the different Old English spellings were the result of folk etymologies. Although modern dictionaries do not yet record the results of the latest etymological research on this word, they do record the results of older research that shows that the second half is not related to the modern word hold. According to the linguist Anatoly Liberman, the most likely etymology is that the term referred to a threshing area that was originally not part of the doorway but was later associated with it: Cultural symbolism In many cultures it has a special symbolism: for instance, in Poland, Ukraine and Russia it is considered bad luck to shake hands or kiss across the threshold when meeting somebody.

Ms. Seomo, an AIDS patient (28 years old at the time), became aware that she contracted AIDS, but had sexual relations with someone else. Seomo, was a housewife from Haenam-gun, and worked at an adult entertainment establishment, and became infected with AIDS. She worked at an adult entertainment establishment in Jindo County, and had sexual relations with other people. However, their identities were revealed, and there were only four individuals who received a medical examination. All four hid this fact, and went to clinics in other areas, including Gwangju and Mokpo-si. Since these facts were not revealed, an AIDS scare spread. Seomo was originally a housewife, but ran away from home. However, she went to Jindo County because of a job placement agency. The circumstances of human trafficking came to light during the investigation, where Mr. K (35 years old) received an introduction fee of ten million won, and sold Ms. Seo to a tea room, and he became wanted on suspicion of violating the Punishment of Violence Act. The investigation revealed that Ms. Seo had sexual relations with four individuals, including Mr. S (31 years old) of the same neighborhood, without using a contraceptive. In addition to this, in mid April, Ms. Seo was lured by Mr. K who said \\"let's go on a trip to Mokpo\\" and was sold by way of a Mokpo job placement agency to Wando Tea Room, and worked for three days. After being diagnosed with AIDS, she divorced her husband, and in the process of the investigation, the fact that she ran away in the interim was also revealed. The majority of the men who had sexual relations with Seomo did not cooperate with the investigation, and instead tried to cover it up and conceal the facts. This scandal was called the Jindo AIDS scandal, as well as the 2002 Jindo sex scandal.  Overview  = Cause = On June 12, 2002, Ms. Seomo (28 years old), was booked and investigated by the Jindo Police Agency on suspicion of having sexual relations with four men (violation of the Prevention of AIDS Act), while hiding the fact that she had contracted AIDS. Mr. K (35 years old) received an introduction fee of ten million won, and sold Ms. Seo to a tea room, and he became wanted on suspicion of violating the Punishment of Violence Act. Initially, it was revealed that Seomo had went to a team room to engage in prostitution, however, it became known that she had been placed there by a job placement agency. However, the exact place where Seomo contracted AIDS was not revealed. This incident occurred back to back with the 2001 Yeosu AIDS scandal. Seomo is originally from Haenam-gun, Jeollanam-do, and moved to Jindo County around the end of 2001. Jindo County Clinic said that Ms. Seomo moved her residence from Haenam to Jindo at the end of last year, and was managed throughout that time, however, the Clinic could not have known the fact that she had sexual relations. Police investigated and revealed the acts of the illegal job placement introduction related with the employment, and there is evidence that management of the AIDS patient was not done properly. Fortunately, Seomi experience realized some odd symptoms, and went to the hospital for treatment in April 2001, where she was diagnosed with AIDS. Once she was confirmed as an AIDS patient in May 2001, her husband divorced her, and she went to go live with her family in her hometown, Jindo. She was designated as a target of special infection disease management, and went to get and take drugs once a month from health authorities. After getting divorced, she went to a team room in Jindo County at the introduction of a job placement agency, and tried to escape. The investigation revealed that Ms. Seo had sexual relations with four individuals, including Mr. S (31 years old) of the same neighborhood, without using a contraceptive, from January 2002. In addition to this, in mid April, Ms. Seo was lured by Mr. K who said \\"let's go on a trip to Mokpo\\" and was sold by way of a Mokpo job placement agency to Wando Tea Room, and worked for three days. The four individuals, including Mr. S., whom had sexual relations with Ms. Seo, were examined for AIDS infection at the Jindo County Clinic, and it was revealed that the test results for all four came back negative. =Investigation= On June 12, 2002, Ms. Seomo (28 years old), was booked and investigated by the Jindo Police Agency on suspicion of having sexual relations with four men (violation of the Prevention of AIDS Act), while hiding the fact that she had contracted AIDS. Police suspected that Ms. Seo knew that she had contracted the AIDS virus in April, but did not take preventive measures, and had sexual relations with three men on nine occasions. Victims were tracked down after seeking facts about the sexual relations with men from Seomo. However, the majority of men that were identified denied the suspicions. =Response of Health Authorities= The AIDS scare from this incident did not blow over easily.

It was armed with two American light-barrel Browning .50-calibre AN/M2 heavy machine guns ‚Äî the standard American defensive weapon used in turreted and flexible mounts in the B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator. Development of the turret began in 1943 as part of a program to improve the Lancaster's defensive armament but it did not enter production until late 1944. The Royal Air Force (RAF) ordered 600 Rose turrets in June 1944 and 400 were completed by the end of the Second World War in Europe. The turret was generally regarded as an improvement over previous designs, although its guns had a high rate of stoppage during combat. Development When introduced to service, all three of the Avro Lancaster's gun turrets were fitted with Browning medium machine guns firing the .303 British round. The front and mid-upper turret were each fitted with two .303 guns, and the rear turret had four. A small number of early Lancasters were also equipped with a ventral turret on the bottom of the fuselage fitted with two .303s, but this turret was phased out from 1942.McKinstry (2009), pp. 130‚Äì131 The .303 guns were soon regarded as being inadequate, however, and in 1942 the Air Staff identified a requirement to fit the Lancasters with a turret armed with more powerful 0.50 inch (12.7 mm) heavy machine guns \\"as soon as possible\\"; this view was supported by Air Marshal Arthur Harris, the commanding officer of Bomber Command.McKinstry (2009), p. 429 A conference was held at the Air Ministry on 11 January 1943 to discuss the optimal armament for the Lancaster. The consensus view of the participants was that the aircraft should be fitted with two 20 mm cannon in its mid-upper turret, two .303 inch guns in the forward turret and two .50 inch guns in the rear turret. At the conclusion of the conference, Air Vice Marshal Ralph Sorley, who was responsible for the RAF's technical requirements, stated that \\"every effort should be made to introduce the mid- upper and redesigned tail turrets in a year's time\\" and that the Lancaster's armament would be obsolete if this deadline was not met.McKinstry (2009), pp. 429‚Äì430 Despite Sorley's views, development of an upgraded rear turret for the Lancaster proceeded slowly. Harris became frustrated with the slow progress of the project, and did not believe that the Air Ministry would be able to produce the turret in time. As a result, he decided to go outside the official channels and personally asked the small Gainsborough firm of Rose Brothers to develop a turret for the Lancaster; this company had previously developed an improved gun mounting for the Handley Page Hampden bomber in 1940 upon a request from Harris.McKinstry (2009), pp. 430‚Äì431 The Ministry of Aircraft Production subsequently offered to provide draughtsmen to help Rose Brothers develop the turret, but the head of the company turned down this offer and relied upon Air Vice Marshal Edward Rice for technical advice. Rice was one of the senior Bomber Command station commanders, and had travelled with Harris to visit Rose Brothers at the start of the project. He subsequently led No. 1 Group RAF.McKinstry (2009), p. 431 Harris obtained Sorley's agreement to support the development of what was by then known as the Rose turret in June 1943. However, Nash & Thompson, which produced the Lancaster's .303 turrets, was also commissioned to develop a .50 inch armed turret as the Air Ministry and Ministry of Aircraft production did not want to rely upon Rose Brothers alone. Nash & Thompson's design was known as the FN82.McKinstry (2009), pp. 431‚Äì432 Development of the two new turret designs continued throughout 1943, but neither was ready by early 1944. The Rose turret shook severely during its early firing trials; this was eventually attributed to poor workmanship of the turret's base ring. In June 1944, the RAF placed an order for 600 Rose turrets after the problems with the design had been resolved. The turrets were built by hand at Rose Brothers' factory at Gainsborough, and were eventually produced at the rate of one per day; this rate was considered to be slow by the Air Staff. Production of the Rose turret ceased at the end of the war ‚Äì by this time 400 had been completed.McKinstry (2009), pp. 433‚Äì436 The FN82 took even longer to develop, and the first production model was completed in January 1945.McKinstry (2009), p. 434 None of Bomber Command's Lancasters had been fitted with an FN82 by the end of the war. Characteristics Rear view of the Rose turret at RAF Museum London showing the design's two M2 Browning heavy machine guns The Rose turret was a roomy design equipped with two M2 Browning heavy machine guns. The turret was driven by hydraulics, and the hydraulic system was easier to use than that in previous designs. The considerable internal space meant that the turret could be fitted with two seats: a layout in which one man operated the guns and the other fed targeting data into the gunsight computer was developed, but not used in practice.Bowyer (1979), p. 51 An unusual feature of the Rose design was that the turret was not fully enclosed. Previous designs had perspex around the gun position, but in the Rose turret there was no protective shielding immediately in front of the gunner. This feature reflected operational experience: many Lancaster gunners had cut away parts of their turret perspex in order to obtain a better view, a practice that had originated at RAF Gransden Lodge, and which was subsequently known as the \\"Gransden Lodge modification\\". Testing of the Rose turret found that the open design reduced the temperature in the turret ‚Äì which was typically very low ‚Äì by only four degrees Celsius compared with a closed design.Bowyer (1979), pp. 51‚Äì52 As well as improving the gunner's view, this feature also made it easier for him to bail out of the aircraft in an emergency.McKinstry (2009), p. 435 Operational service Rose turrets began to be used operationally from late 1944.Bowyer (1979), p. 52 The turrets were mainly fitted to aircraft in No. 1 Group, though some were allocated to No. 5 Group.Falconer (1998), p. 94 Most Lancaster rear gunners regarded the turret as an improvement because of its heavier firepower. However, the turrets proved to be less reliable than the older design, and research conducted by the Ministry of Air found that 60 percent of Rose turrets experienced gun stoppages during combat compared with 23 percent of the .303-equipped turrets. On the positive side, aircraft fitted with the Rose turret were found to be half as likely to be attacked by fighters as other Lancasters ‚Äì the researchers suggested that \\"this may be accounted by the increased field of view from the turret which would assist evasion from attacks\\". By the end of the war, 180 Rose turrets had been fitted to Lancasters.Harris (1995), p. 108 In his Despatch on War Operations, Harris stated that the turret was the only improvement made to the defensive armament of the RAF's heavy bombers after 1942, and argued that \\"those responsible for turret design and production displayed an extraordinary disregard\\" for Bomber Command's requirements.Harris (1995), p. 111 References ;Citations ;Bibliography  * Category:British inventions Category:Aircraft weapons ","title":"Rose turret"},{"id":"35806870","text":"Flint mining is the process of extracting flint from underground.

He is the first commercially successful TV channel owner in the Middle East. In 2018, the government of Saudi Arabia arranged to acquire 60 percent of MBC, leaving the remaining 40 per cent of the company in Al Ibrahim‚Äôs hands. MBC Group said in a statement that Al Ibrahim would retain his stake and had, in his capacity as chairman, reviewed growth plans during a held in the United Arab Emirates on 29 May 2018. Early life and education Waleed Al Ibrahim was born in 1962 and raised in Saudi Arabia. He has eight brothers. Two of his elder brothers, Abdulaziz and Khalid, are businessmen investing in real estate in the U.S.. His sister, Al Jawhara Al Ibrahim, was one of the wives of the late King Fahd. Another, Maha Al Ibrahim, married to former deputy minister of defence and aviation, Prince Abdul Rahman. His third sister, Mohdi Al Ibrahim, is married to former Saudi minister of higher education, Khaled Al Angari. Al Ibrahim received education in Oregon, USA, during the 1980s and completed his higher education there. Business activities =ARAvision= After completing his university education, al Ibrahim founded ARA Productions and Television Studios (ARAvision) in Saudi Arabia. It was his first enterprise in media. Later, it was called ARA Group International, becoming a media conglomerate that is made up of several radio and television companies airing the whole Arab world. His company, ARAvision, was registered in Riyadh in 1995. The company was provided with an exclusive licence to deliver a wireless cable service to major cities in the Kingdom. Therefore, it was able to screen the satellite channels' content before being broadcast. =Middle East Broadcasting Company (MBC)= Al Ibrahim founded MBC in London in 1991 with another entrepreneur, Saleh Kamal, launching the first independent Arabic satellite TV station. In fact, the channel was directly linked to King Fahd himself through him. Waleed al Ibrahim was still in his twenties when he founded MBC. MBC is part of ARAvision. MBC acquired United Press International that was bankrupt at that time for $3.95 million in 1992 to bolster its news- gathering scope. Subsequently, the station introduced several movie and Arabic TV series channels including MBC 2, MBC 3 and MBC 4. Later, two more channels were launched. One of them is MBC Persia, broadcasting Hollywood films with Persian subtitles, and the other one is MBC Action, airing action movies. MBC Bollywood was launched in 2013. Al Ibrahim also launched Al Arabiya in February 2003 with the aim of providing an alternative to Al Jazeera. He stated his goal for Al Arabiya was to position it as the CNN to Al Jazeera's Fox News. Through this position, Al Arabiya was thought to be a TV channel that is calm, cool, professional, providing objective reporting rather than for extremely emphasized opinions. Although Al Ibrahim is widely known as the owner of the MBC, it is reported that fifty percent of the MBC profits are owned by late King Fahd's youngest son and his nephew, Abdulaziz bin Fahd. It is further reported that Prince Abdulaziz deals with both the profits and ideology of MBC Channels, including Al Arabiya. =Others= In the 1990s Al Ibrahim was shareholder and board member of the United Press International (UPI). He served as the chairman of the UPI board until the early 1999. =Family investments= In 1990, the wealth of his brothers, Abdulaziz Al Ibrahim and Khalid Al Ibrahim, was reported to have been US$1.0 billion. It was argued that they made their wealth through being Boeing and Rolls-Royce representatives in Saudi deals. Their wealth was reported to have been US$1.2 billion in 1991. They had real estate investments in the US, including Marina del Rey in Los Angeles, a property near Disney World, and a hotel next to the Mayo Clinic. They also invested in Orlando real estate. Arrest On 4 November 2017, Al Ibrahim was detained in Saudi Arabia in a corruption crackdown conducted by a new royal anti-corruption committee. Al Ibrahim was held at Riyadh‚Äôs Ritz-Carlton hotel. Over the weekend of 26‚Äì27 January 2018, Al Ibrahim was released along with at least half a dozen other prominent Saudi businessmen detained in the probe, after being found innocent of any wrongdoing. In May 2018, Saudi Arabian authorities allowed Al Ibrahim to leave the Kingdom for the first time since November 2017 to chair a strategy meeting at the headquarters of MBC Group in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Al Ibrahim had been required to remain inside the Kingdom as the government finalised arrangements to take a controlling 60 percent stake in MBC. Following the meeting, MBC Group released a statement, with Al Ibrahim quoted as saying: ‚ÄúThe coming stage shall witness MBC Group‚Äôs entry into new markets and sectors, in various fields, with the group shifting a greater focus towards Saudi Arabia and neighbouring regions, in line with the current transformational positive changes occurring in the Kingdom.‚Äù Wealth Al Ibrahim was the 27th richest Arab in the Middle East with the wealth of US$2.9 billion in 2009. His net worth is of more than 6 billion dollars. Awards Al Ibrahim has been awarded for his contributions in the field of Arab media. He was among top 20 prominent Gulf businessmen according to Amwal magazine in 2005. He was chosen to be the 27th most influential Arab among 100 Arab personalities by Arabian Business in 2007. He was named the 'Media Man of the Year' at the 4th MENA Cristal Awards held in Lebanon in 2008. He also received other awards, including the \\"Knight\\" award from the Arab League in 2006 and \\"Innovator of the Year\\" award from Arabian Business. He was chosen as the first among top 50 figures in MENA‚Äôs media, marketing and advertising industry in 2011. He was named as the world's 66th most influential Arab personality by Gulf News in 2012, citing his prominent position in the Arab media.

It is celebrated as Guernsey and Jersey's national day. History Re-enacting the raising of flags on Liberation Day 2011 On 9 May 1945, HMS Bulldog arrived in St Peter Port, Guernsey, and the German forces surrendered unconditionally aboard the vessel at dawn. British forces landed in St Peter Port shortly afterwards, greeted by crowds of joyous but malnourished islanders singing, amongst other patriotic songs, \\"Sarnia- Cherie\\". The same day, , which had set out from Plymouth, arrived in Jersey to accept the surrender of the occupying forces there. Two naval officers, Surgeon Lieutenant Ronald McDonald and Sub Lieutenant R Milne, were met by the Harbour Master, who escorted them to his office where they together hoisted the Union Flag, before also raising it on the flagstaff of the Pomme D'Or Hotel. This has been re-enacted every year on Liberation Day since 1995. From 2003 to 2011 former Harbour Master and Jerseyman Captain Howard Le Cornu performed this annually. His father, John E. Le Cornu, and uncle, David M. Le Cornu, had been in the crowds and had witnessed the occasion on 9 May 1945. Sark was liberated on 10 May 1945, and the German troops in Alderney surrendered on 16 May 1945. Official status The Public Holidays and Bank Holidays (Jersey) Act 1952 established Liberation Day as a public holiday if it fell on a weekday. The Public Holidays and Bank Holidays (Jersey) Act 2010 further laid down that Liberation was also to be a public holiday if it falls on a Saturday. It is not a public holiday, and no day off in lieu is provided, if it falls on a Sunday. Ceremonies Bailiff, Lieutenant-Governor and other officials in procession on Liberation Day 2012 Since the 50th anniversary of Liberation in 1995, a pattern of official ceremonies has developed based in and around Liberation Square in Saint Helier where the events at the Harbour Master's Office and Pomme D'Or Hotel occurred in 1945. Following a special sitting of the States of Jersey in the morning, States Members, clergy, the Bailiff of Jersey, the Lieutenant-Governor, Jurats, Crown Officers and other officials process from the Royal Square to Liberation Square accompanied by the Royal Mace and the Bailiff's Seal. An open air ecumenical service takes place in Liberation Square followed by the singing of \\"Man Bieau P'tit J√®rri\\"/\\"Beautiful Jersey\\" (in J√®rriais and English) and a re-enactment of the raising of flags (including that at Fort Regent). A parade of vintage and military vehicles, bands and service organisations is reviewed by the official party. The afternoon community celebrations are of an informal character, including a programme of entertainments and stalls in Saint Helier. An official ceremony also takes place at the Crematorium where there is a memorial to victims and slave workers of various nationalities. Representatives of affected nationalities take part in the commemoration. In 1995, artist Eric Snellhttp://ericsnell.co.uk/commissioned-work/liberation- monument designed the Liberation Monument in St Peter Port to commemorate Liberation day. The States of Guernsey commissioned the design for a new Liberation Monument to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Liberation from the German occupying forces in 1945. The result is a truly amazing fusion of art and science. On the 9th May each year the shadow from the needle-like monument falls across a bench recording the events of that day at the exact same time they occurred. On the 9th May 1995, at 1.40 pm, His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, unveiled the Monument, to the accompaniment of a fly-past of military helicopters. The Monument continues to serve both its commemorative function and its utilitarian one, a popular spot for people to sit and enjoy the sunshine, and occasionally the shadow.https://guernseydonkey.com/guernseys-liberation-monument-a-fusion-of- art-and-science/ See also * Liberation Day * Victory in Europe Day References External links * Category:May observances Category:National days Category:Jersey culture Category:Annual events in Jersey Category:Events in Guernsey Category:Spring (season) events in Jersey ","title":"Liberation Day (Channel Islands)"},{"id":"35807118","text":"Onward is the twenty seventh studio album and a double-album by British space rock band Hawkwind.

Mets√§ Group's core businesses are tissue and cooking papers (Mets√§ Tissue), board (Mets√§ Board), pulp (Mets√§ Fibre), wood products (Mets√§ Wood) as well as wood trade and forestry services (Mets√§ Forest). Mets√§ Group's sales totalled EUR 5.0 billion in 2012, and it employs approximately 11,500 people. Mets√§liitto Cooperative, the parent company of Mets√§ Group, is owned by its 100,000 Finnish forest owning members. History Mets√§liitto Cooperative, the parent company of Mets√§ Group, can trace its origins back to the cooperative movement which started to establish itself in Finland at around the beginning of the 20th century. Operations started with shared sales, and Mets√§liitto Oy, established in 1934, continued this at first with timber exports. Mets√§liitto, which became a cooperative in 1947, started its industrial operations through its own sawmill business, expanding to the chemical forest industry in the 1950s. The Finnish forest industry grew and internationalised at a brisk pace from the 1960s, becoming one of the pillars of Finnish well-being and prosperity. Mets√§liitto's operations also expanded. Important milestones for Mets√§liitto included the founding of Mets√§-Serla as a result of the combination merger of G. A. Serlachius Oy and Mets√§liiton Teollisuus Oy in 1987; and the many growth and development steps in the pulp industry within Mets√§-Botnia Oy. During the strong growth period at the beginning of the 1990s, Mets√§liitto continued to make major investments in Finland, but, like many other companies, also aimed at foreign markets. At the beginning of the 2000s, Mets√§liitto was an international forest industry group with more than 25,000 employees in dozens of different countries. As a result of strong structural changes during the past few years, the Group is now a more compact entity aiming for growth in selected business operations. However, the basis for its operations still lies in the cooperative concept and acting in the best interests of Finnish forest owners.

Around 1890, it was probably the largest producer of watches in the world. The company produced watches in Langendorf, Switzerland for exactly a century, from 1873 to 1973. The most famous brand of the company was Lanco (an abbreviation of Langendorf Watch Company) that was launched as a brand name in the late 1950s. The brand was discontinued in the late 1960s, and revived again from 1971 to around 1980. History = Foundation = Colonel Johann Viktor Kottmann (1822‚Äì1881) founded Uhrenfabrik Langendorf SA in 1873. The factory remained in the hands of his family until 1964. The factory was located in the village Langendorf, canton of Solothurn, district of Lebern, Switzerland. Johann Viktor Kottmann was from nearby Solothurn and had been involved in industrial production of chicory and tobacco products since the 1850s. The factory in Langendorf had been producing chicory since 1851, but was rebuilt in 1873 to produce ebauches (parts of movements for watches) for other watch producing companies. At its founding, the company had been employing between 70 and 80 workers, but the number of workers was drastically reduced when the company almost suffered an economic collapse in 1880 ‚Äì allegedly due to severe problems with alcoholism and absenteeism among employees. Perhaps for those reasons, the factory began organizing housing and training of their workers, and it gained a reputation for being socially responsible. It built schools, a hydrant system and financed the installation of electric lights in Langendorf. The Kottmann family also founded a society for community work that is still active. = Growth of the company = In the middle of 1880 ‚Äì just before the company otherwise would have been liquidated ‚Äì Johann's son Karl Kottmann (1844‚Äì1890) took over. Karl was able to attract specialists from western Switzerland who helped turn the company around. Orders began flowing in, and production was expanded strongly. In 1881, some 200 workers were employed at the factory. Production continued to soar under the leadership of Karl Kottmann, who was admired for implementing a rational and mechanized production line. He was also the architect behind the socially responsible initiatives taken by the company. From 1887 and onwards, production was deepened, and the company became largely independent of suppliers. Karl Kottmann died in 1890, and the technical director, Lucien Tieche, took over the company and changed its name to Langendorf Watch Company. All major watch producing companies from the Neuch√¢tel area were ordering parts and ebauches from Langendorf Watch Company whose workforce grew to around 1.000 by 1890. During that era, the factory was probably the largest watch producer in the world. An advertisement from 1916 showing picture of the factory claimed that it employed 1.500 workers and produced 3.000 time-pieces daily. By 1920 the company was also producing alarm clocks. In 1924, a branch was established at Lommiswil, and the following year also an agency in La Chaux-de-Fonds. A 1959 advert boasted that a large new factory would be completed that year and produce Lanco watches. = Final years of the Kottmann family and the end of independency = When the old factory building was modernized in 2008, an old concrete logo from the Langendorf Watch Company was uncovered. In 1902, Ernst Kottmann (1874‚Äì1944) became manager of the company which he led until 1942 when he had to resign due to health reasons. Among other initiatives, Ernst made the change from steam-powered production to electricity. His brother Rudolf Kottmann held the position until 1964. Hans Kottmann took over in 1964, but died the same year in an accident. The company was then led by Guido Kottmann and a committee of family members, but due to challenging business conditions ‚Äì and perhaps problems of mismanagement ‚Äì the company decided to join a conglomerate of watch makers called \\"Schweizerischen Gesellschaft f√ºr Uhrenindustrie AG\\" (SGU) in 1964. Soon after, in 1965, the Langendorf Watch Company was bought by \\"Soci√©t√© Suisse pour l'Industrie Horlog√®re SA\\" (SSIH) which was itself the result of a 1930 merger between Omega and Tissot. Along with the Langendorf Watch Company, SSIH acquired more than fifty of its competitors, fueled by its newfound commercial success. The Langendorf Watch Company was attractive for the Lanco brand and its highly sophisticated and semi-automated production line with modern manufacturing equipment. With the acquisition, SSIH managed to broaden its product range and got the machinery needed to produce quality products at a lower cost than before. In 1973, production was ceased at the Langendorf production facilities, and the Lanco brand was relegated to the Aetos Watch Company, another sub-branch of SSIH. Since 1977, the old factory building in Langendorf has been a shopping centre. Although SSIH was Switzerland's largest and the world's third largest producer of watches, the company suffered due to heavy competition. It went on to merge with ASUAG into SSIH/ASUAG Holding Company in 1983 ‚Äì which was renamed SMH in 1986 and in 1988 became The Swatch Group. Products = Watches = From 1890, the main brand of the Langendorf Watch Company was \\"Langendorf\\", but the company produced watches and parts that were sold under many other brand names such as Aliada, Barracuda, Carex, Cavalier, Lancet, Stratford, Valogene and the most rare Piquette with AMKO branded movements. Many of the watches were produced for export, and in order to avoid paying duties, many were cased inside the importing country, including the USA where Langendorf watches were imported by American Swiss Watch Company from the beginning of the 20th century. The latter was reported out of business as of 1915. During World War I and World War II, the Langendorf Watch Company was renowned for producing military and pilot watches of good quality for servicemen. There's an early wrist watch developed for World War I infantry officers to use in trenches. The 9XX movements from the 1930s and 1940s were very smooth running and were also used in army watches. Many movements from the 1950s and 1960s have 12 or 13 lined movements, the \\"qualit√© exceptionelle\\" in chronometer standards. Lanco pocket watches are also of very good quality, and some include an alarm function. = Lanco = thumb Watches bearing the \\"Lanco\\" brand were being manufactured and sold in the middle 1950s. The illustration to the right is of a Lanco ladies' watch given as a retirement present, engraved on the rear of its case with the date November 1956. The brand soon became successful and known for fine craftsmanship and attention to detail. Lanco watches are still considered to be of very high quality, and they are traded today as vintage watches. A number of Lanco watches are famous, such as the \\"Flying Saucer\\" or the \\"Lanco- Fon\\", a manual-wound watch with an alarm function that was released in the 1960s. When Lanco was revived in the 1970s, more variety was added to the product line. It became a brand with room for innovation and experimentation, including into digital watches. Many of the 1970s watches were relatively large sized for their time and this makes them sought-after today. Watches from the 1970s such as \\"Club 77\\" and \\"Jump Hour\\" are also still quite popular. After 1973, a number of movements from other suppliers were used for Lanco chronographs, the most famous calibers stemming from Valjoux and Angelus. A Lanco watch with the futuristic Tissot Astrolon movement (caliber 2250) was also produced in the 1970s. During SSIH's financial problems in 1981, the Lanco brand name was sold. As of 1998, new Lanco watches are being sold in South Africa by S. Bacher & Company, under license from The Swatch Group.

The line ran in a roughly north-northwesterly direction, beginning in Gare de Mont√©rolier-Buchy (which is located in the commune of Mont√©rolier and is a part of the Amiens‚ÄìRouen railway) and terminating in the small town of Saint- Sa√´ns. The line passed through the town of Saint-Martin-Osmonville and over the Pont-du-Thil. It was administered on behalf of the d√©partement by the Compagnie des chemins de fer du Nord.Andr√© Dubuc, \\"La ligne de chemin de fer de Rouen √† Amiens\\" in Les transports de 1610 √† nos jours, Actes du 104e congr√®s national des soci√©t√©s savantes (Bordeaux, 1979), Paris, Biblioth√®que Nationale, 1980, p. 287 The line is a cul-de-sac. History =Planning= When the Amiens-Rouen railway was commissioned on April 8, 1867 by the Compagnie des chemins de fer du Nord, the town of Saint-Sa√´ns was excluded from its route. It was a distance of some to the nearest station, the Gare de Mont√©rolier-Buchy, and a lack of local public transport made it difficult for residents of the municipality to access the railway.Herv√© Bertin, Petits Trains et Tramways haut-normands, p. 39 This lack of access affected the local economy, particularly in the manufacturing sector, with the industries of cotton spinning and leather tanning suffering from import and export of both raw materials and produce.Jos√© Banaudo, Trains oubli√©s, vol.4 : L'√âtat, le Nord, les Ceintures, p. 158. =Construction= The town station, built with grant funds After the survey for the planning of the route was completed on April 16, 1896, the town council made a decision on the route of the proposed branch line, and opted for the most direct route, bypassing the intervening communes of Mont√©rolier, Neufbosc, Mathonville, and Bradiancourt.Herv√© Bertin, Petits Trains et Tramways haut-normands, p. 40. This route, which extended further east to meet the demands of the town council, met with the opposition of the railway company operating the Amiens-Roun line. However, a deal was agreed upon and the company agreed to begin work on the construction of the line. The town of Saint-Sa√´ns, wishing to hasten the construction and associate itself with the building of the line, decided on May 18, 1897 to provide the sum of 60,000 francs towards the construction of the line. However, the sum was only enough for the construction of a station. The work was carried out expeditiously, although there were two fatalities in December 1899. The line was commissioned on schedule and opened on October 14, 1900.Encyclop√©die g√©n√©rale des transports ‚Äì Chemins de fer, tome 12, 76.2. =Closure= After World War II, the line was no longer profitable, and it closed on January 1, 1953.

Although the city has mostly dispensed with the appendage of \\"Taunus\\" in its name the station still officially retains it, although signs on the newest platform and Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund maps do not include it. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 4 station. History In 1895, construction began on the Usingen Railway (), now the Taunus Railway (Taunusbahn), to connect Friedrichsdorf and the Taunus communities with Frankfurt in order \\"to bring the backwardness of the region to an end.\\" It ran a single track from the Usinger Bahnhof (‚ÄúUsingen station‚Äù) in Bad Homburg via Seulberg to Friedrichsdorf and continued via K√∂ppern into the Taunus. During its construction, Friedrichsdorf station was planned as a through station. Already plans had been developed for another rail connection between Friedrichsdorf and the Main‚ÄìWeser Railway. The Friedberg‚ÄìFriedrichsdorf railway was not opened until 1901. Its construction lead to the upgrading of the whole line from Frankfurt via Friedrichsdorf to Friedberg in order to increase its capacity, at the personal request of Emperor Wilhelm II, including its duplication from 1907 until 1910. Initially there were two passenger tracks and a freight track at the station. To the south towards Seulberg, a wooden bridge was built across the tracks. The station building is west of the tracks. It consists of a central building with two floors and two lateral extensions and is very similar to Usingen station. The line was soon carrying freight. Especially in freight operations, excess demand often caused delays. Later, direct sidings were built to local firms. R√ºhl AG & Co. and the Tettauer glass works both had a siding. The main operation of the glass works was established in Friedrichsdorf in 1945, as the rail connection to its original plant in Tettau was cut by the establishment of the inner-German border (even though it was in Bavaria). On 27 September 1970, electric services began running on the line to Friedrichsdorf. In addition, seven years later a relay interlocking was built in Bad Homburg, controlling the area from Wei√ükirchen and extended to Friedrichsdorf in 1978. The trains on the lines from Gr√§venwiesbach (the Taunus Railway) and Friedberg (the Friedberg‚ÄìFriedrichsdorf railway) now mainly ended in Friedrichsdorf. In 1974, operations of an S-Bahn-like service as line R 5 began on the line between Frankfurt Central Station and Friedrichsdorf with its inclusion in the Frankfurter Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund (Frankfurt Transport Association, the forerunner of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund between 1974 and 1995, FVV). This evolved in 1978 into the current line S 5 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn. In 1992, the line of the Usingen Railway from Friedrichsdorf to Gr√§venwiesbach was reactivated in 1993 as the ‚ÄúT-Bahn‚Äù and supported by the FVV. The trains now continued to Bad Homburg. Since the take-over of operations by the Rhein-Main- Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main Transport Association, RMV), no Taunus Railway services now terminate in Friedrichsdorf. Infrastructure Friedrichsdorf station is now served by three lines, with two of them terminating there: the line to Friedberg (RMV line 16) and S-Bahn line S5, as the electrification of the line ends there. The other service on the Taunus Railway (RMV line 15) continues to Bad Homburg, or‚Äîin the peak hour‚ÄîFrankfurt Central Station. New LCD information displays went into service in February 2008. =Buildings and facilities = Entrance building with the home platform (track 2) in the summer of 2007 Restored underpass There was still a ticket office in the entrance building until 2005. The entrance building is privately owned but has not been used for some years and there are continuing negotiations over restoring it to use. A vending machine was placed in a converted shipping container on the platform as a replacement for the ticket counter in the entrance building. In this Deutsche Bahn Servicepavillon tickets were sold along with drinks, snacks and magazines. At the beginning of 2008, it was closed without notice, but shortly afterwards it was re-opened by another operator. In 2009, Taunus Real acquired the entrance building and renovated it. The services operated from the kiosk have been moved back into the building and it is intended that the container on the platform will be removed. The area of the entrance building that was formerly operated as a pub and the upper storey are still unused. Since December 2007, the town of Friedrichsdorf has attempted to have the condition of the platforms and, especially, the subway resolved. The municipality has organised the restoration of the subway, partly using volunteer labour. =Tracks= S-Bahn and Taunusbahn services meeting at the station Friedrichsdorf station has four platform tracks. In the past there were 8 tracks, which were controlled by the local signal box. All platforms have a height of 76 cm. Services In front of the entrance building there is a small bus station, from which municipal buses operate to the local area and to Bad Homburg as well as line 59 to Gr√§venwiesbach and line FB-16 to Friedberg.

However, with the coming of the British Rule the elders of that time realised that fluency in English was the key to better employment opportunities. Which may also explain why Matharpacady's Portuguese heritage is rather downplayed compared to Goa's despite having some of the best preserved Portuguese style architecture. \\"On the way to and from Church my aunts would speak in Portuguese but they strictly forbade us from speaking in anything but English\\" so related the late Sheila Gonsalves to her son.

The episode is written by Nathaniel Halpern and directed by showrunner Veena Sud. In the episode, Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) frantically searches for a missing Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman), Stan Larsen (Brent Sexton) meets with several people regarding his reward to find his daughter's killer. and Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell) returns to work. Plot \\"Off the Reservation\\" picks up right where \\"Keylela\\" ended. Linden calls a police dispatcher to order a search team for Holder and takes Jack (Liam James) to Holder's apartment. Jack wants her to stay and let the cops look for Holder. She receives a call to learn Lt. Carlson (Mark Moses) denied the search team. At the station, she storms into Carlson's office and warns him that if Internal Affairs finds out he did nothing while a cop died in the field, it will come back to haunt him. He tells her his officers are too busy checking out sources for the $12,000 reward Stan Larsen offered at the press conference. Linden drives to the Indian reservation and is stopped by a road block. Casino security chief Roberta Drays (Patti Kim) appears and threatens her with a gun. Linden tells her if Linden and Holder don't make it off the reservation, the case will fall under federal jurisdiction, which trumps tribal sovereignty. Almost immediately thereafter, Carlson arrives with a search team, telling Linden they have until dawn before the tribe's lawyers show up. Officers sweep the grounds and find Holder's Pez dispenser. While searching a nearby dump in the morning light, Linden notices a young girl, who points towards the woods (in the opposite direction from where the Pez dispenser was found). The search team is redirected, and the K-9 units pick up a scent as Wapi tribal chief Nicole Jackson (Claudia Ferri) and her lawyers meet Carlson at his car. In the woods, Holder's unconscious, battered body is found slumped against a tree. Outside Holder's hospital room, a doctor tells Linden that Holder has several contusions and broken ribs, and is suffering from hypothermia. Linden calls her son to tell him Holder is okay. Holder's sister Liz (Marin Ireland) gives Linden a matchbook from the B.B. Hair Emporium ‚Äî the matchbook that casino maid Mary gave to Holder. Liz tells her that Holder insisted on giving it to Linden, who notes the \\"Tomorrow 11 a.m.\\" written on the matchbook and checks her watch. At the Larsen house, Stan answers a phone inquiry about the reward. Tad Marek (Tim Henry) arrives to look after the Larsen boys while Stan takes care of incoming tips. He tells Stan that attention generated by the reward may not be good for the family, but Stan ignores him. Outside the hospital, Richmond (Billy Campbell) tells the press he is relieved to be going home but ignores a reporter's question about his activities on the night of Rosie's murder. At the campaign office, Jamie (Eric Ladin) insists that Richmond tell voters where he was on that night; Richmond refuses. At the City Council chambers later, Mayor Adams (Tom Butler) reveals that he is working a deal with Jackson to obtain the waterfront property from her tribe. Richmond arrives to tell him that he knows about the doctored photo that implicated him in the murder and leaves. Visibly shaken, Adams orders Benjamin Abani (Colin Lawrence) to find out who leaked the information. At the barber shop, Mary (Q'orianka Kilcher) tells Linden that she saw Rosie boarding the casino's elevator on the night of her murder, even though she was not scheduled to work as a maid nor hostess that night. She adds that everyone's tenth-floor keys were taken away after that. When Linden notices Mary's chapped red hands, Mary explains that Jackson insists on using cheap cleaning chemicals ‚Äî the same chemicals found on Rosie's hands. Mary says Jackson controls everything on the reservation. At the station, Stan gives Linden a notebook filled with tips, but she waves them off, adding that if he pursues the reward aspect, people will only take advantage of him. She arrives at her office to find her belongings being packed into boxes, including the evidence bag containing Rosie's keys. Carlson asks for her badge and gun, blaming her for putting them in a political mess by disobeying orders and nearly getting her partner killed, which has led to every officer's wanting retribution. She goes to Holder's apartment but is ordered out by police officers. Asking about Jack, she learns that he was gone before the cops arrived. She later finds Jack alone at Regi's vacant dock. He tells his mother that he ran when the cops pulled up, assuming they were going to take him away. While brainstorming new campaign strategies with Jamie, Gwen (Kristin Lehman) suggests they attack the foundation of Adams' campaign, the waterfront development project, by ensuring the tribe does not give him the land. She later tells Richmond that she scheduled a meeting between him and Jackson for the next morning. He chastises her for not consulting him, and when she says they have no time he yells at her, saying that he has to face the results of his staff's bad decisions. He then blames her for telling the police about his disappearance on the night of Rosie's murder. At the hospital, Holder wakes up to find his nephew Davie (Arien Boey) alone in the room with him. He gives Davie a gold coin to replace the one he took from him in his junkie days. Holder's phone rings repeatedly, and he finally picks up. At the airport, Linden sees Jack off on a flight to Chicago to go stay with his father. She praises his inner strength and promises to see him again soon. As she looks out the airport window, Holder arrives to say Jack called him. Holder attempts to console her. Stan meets Naomi (Nancy Sivak), who says Rosie told her all about him and his daughter loved him. Stan is visibly moved, but Naomi reveals herself to be a medium who offers to contact Rosie for a fee. He later arrives home and ignores the messages on his answering machine. In her car, Linden tells Holder that Rosie's key will get them onto the casino's tenth floor. \\"We need to get that key,\\" she tells him. Holder does not respond as they head back to Seattle. Reception =Critical reception= \\"Off the Reservation\\" received positive reviews. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic rated the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars, stating: \\"The ending was by far more quiet than last week, but it returned Holder to the stage and had the two [detectives] ready to figure out what the mysterious tenth floor is all about. Even with their differences, eccentricities, and problems, Linden and Holder make a great pair and I'm glad they are back together. And sure, even if Jackson and her crew come off as cliche bad guys, I'm glad that we've been able to add a little menace to the series. Whether or not they are truly involved in Rosie's murder is another thing, but I like the direction the show has decided to take.\\" The A.V. Club's Brandon Nowalk rated this episode a B+, saying: \\"It feels like only yesterday I was prattling on about The Killings lack of momentum, but 'Off The Reservation' opens with one of the best, most propulsive 12-minute passages of the entire series, a pulpy race through the black of early morning to find a fallen officer.\\" Adam Vitcavage of Paste magazine gave the episode a 7.3 rating, commenting: \\"We're officially past the halfway point for the second season and The Killing has done a better job of feeding us pieces of information this time around than when they forced red- herring twists into the last five minutes of every episode.\\" CraveOnline's William Bibbiani stated that, throughout the second season, the series \\"has done a less than stellar job of integrating its various storylines\\". He added, \\"'Off the Reservation' doesn't quite jump the shark for AMC's series, but it seems abundantly clear that The Killing has been hovering over the selachimorpha for some time now, unclear what side it wants to fall on.\\" =Ratings= The episode was seen by 1.61 million viewers and obtained an adult 18-49 rating of 0.5, a considerable increase from the previous episode and a return to the seasonal ratings average.

The treaty entered into force on 1 January 2013. Background The convention is a renegotiated version of the Food Aid Convention, as of 2012 the only legally binding international treaty on food aid. The Food Aid Convention is however only focused on a limited number of food items (expressed in wheat equivalent tons), whereas the Food Assistance Convention is focused on \\"nutritious food\\" in general and leaves it up to parties to the convention to state commitments in wheat equivalents or in monetary terms. Negotiations The negotiations have taken place in the framework of the present participants of the food aid convention, and there has been criticism that recipient countries and civil society have been left out. Signature and entry into force The convention was opened for signature on 11 June until 31 December 2012 for 34 states as well as the European Union. From 2013, it was opened to accession to all states and \\"customs territories\\" that did not sign the convention. The convention entered into force on 1 January 2013, as it had been ratified by at least five signatories at that time. As of September 2018, Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, European Union, Finland, France, Japan, Luxembourg, the State of Palestine, Russia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States have become parties to the treaty.

At the age of 103, he was the oldest surviving former County player, and had been widely attributed for being the oldest surviving former professional footballer, although Arthur Smith was one month older at the time of Haigh's death. Career Haigh's career started at Manchester City in 1931, as a junior. He played in the reserves alongside Frank Swift, but when Swift was promoted to the senior side, Haigh stayed where he was. During his time at City, he also worked in a dying and bleaching factory. In 1936, he joined Stockport County, where he played at all levels for County, from the A team right up to the first team. Haigh had the misfortune to score an own goal on his debut for County, and made a second league appearance before the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1940, he enlisted in the Royal Air Force, serving as a physical training instructor and was stationed at RAF Morecambe and RAF Wilmslow, where he trained new recruits and parachutists. He reached the rank of flight sergeant before being commissioned an acting pilot officer (on probation) on 20 June 1941, and was regraded as a pilot officer (on probation) on 20 August. Whilst at Morecambe, he played for the services team as well as the town's football team, and in 1942, joined Rochdale. Rochdale often played Blackpool, and Haigh was usually tasked to mark Stanley Matthews. During wartime, he also made guest appearances for Walsall and Burnley. On 20 June 1942, Haigh was confirmed in the rank of pilot officer, and was promoted to flying officer (war-substantive) on 20 August. He was promoted to flight lieutenant (war- substantive) on 11 September 1944, and was mentioned in despatches in 1945, ending his service with the rank of squadron leader. In 1945, he was offered the player-manager position at Arbroath, but Haigh decided to join Lancaster City as they had offered him a trade as a metal spinner, as well as the captaincy of the team. Coincidentally, the club already had a player who owned an engineering firm, so Haigh was able to train during the week and play for the club on the weekends. The following year, Haigh was later discharged as a sergeant. In 1948, he was appointed as player-manager for Rossendale United. Haigh had been vocal about his time at Rossendale, as he was constantly undermined by the board of directors over prospective new players, so he resigned in 1952, effectively ending his career in football. In 1998, County's club historians got back in touch with Haigh (and even then, he was considered one of the oldest surviving former professional footballers). He maintained regular contact with the club, appearing as a guest of honour in 2008. In 2010, he was one of the first recipients of a Stockport County Appearance Number certificate. He continued to watch County home and away up until after his 100th birthday, but made special appearances after that, notably in November 2018 when he unveiled a plaque at Edgley Park commemorating former players who died in World War I. Haigh suffered from age-related macular degeneration and, until at least 2015, received support from Blind Veterans UK, the national charity for blind and vision-impaired ex-Service men and women.

Coity is part of the community of Coity Higher and is notable for being home to Coity Castle, one of the best preserved castles in Glamorgan. Other buildings of note in the village include St Mary, a 14th-century church, and Ty Mawr, a fine 16th-century house. History The oldest monument in Coity is a burial chamber near Coed Parc Garw woodland. It consists of a large megalith, tilted upwards and supported by other smaller stones. The oldest remaining building in Coity is Coity Castle. Now ruinous, but according to John Newman, \\"(after Caerphilly) ... the most impressive ruined medieval castle in Glamorgan\\", Coity Castle was built c. 1100 by Payn Turberville. Turberville was one of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan, and the construction of Coity Castle was part of Robert Fitzhamon's strategy to subjugate the region. The castle remained in the hands of the Tuberville family before passing to Sir Lawrence Berkerolles by 1380. In 1404 Sir Lawrence found himself under siege at Coity by the forces of Owain Glynd≈µr, and again in 1405. A few years later ownership of the castle was successfully challenged by William Gamage through a court action. The castle remained in the Gamage family who lived at Coity, and in 1584 Barbara Gamage married Robert Sidney, who took ownership. Sidney did not live at the castle, but family members continued to live there until the 18th century. By the time the castle passed to the Earl of Dunraven in 1833, it was ruinous and was placed into state guardianship in 1929. The castle is listed as a grade 1 building, as it is an example of medieval defensive architecture in Wales.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-11254-coity-castle-coity- higher#.WKRXUm-LTIU In the 14th century, a church was founded at Coity and dedicated to Saint Mary. The church also underwent 16th Century alterations and was again restored in 1860 by John Prichard and John Pollard Seddon. The church is listed as a grade 1 building as it retains its 14th Century form and character due to 19th Century restorations.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-11255-church-of-st- mary-coity-higher The church stands to this day and has several key important features, including an Easter Sepulchre (c. 1500). There is also a war memorial located outside St. Marys church, which commemorates the residents of Coity were either killed or missing during both the first sand second world wars the memorial contains 13 names from the first world war and 8 names from the second world war.http://en.tracesofwar.com/article/18526/War-Memorial- Coity.htm Other places of worship included Gilead Welsh Independent Chapel, which saw rebuilding in 1890. Another historical building in Coity is T≈∑ Mawr. A late 16th Century building, with lower wings added in the 19th Century. The building also underwent mid 20th Century alterations. It is a grade 2 listed building due to it being a great example of 16th Century Glamorgan architecture.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-11253-ty-mawr-coity- higher#.WKRaCW-LTIU Bridgend & Coity Golf Club (now defunct) first appeared in 1928.

It was owned and operated by Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (the Greater Stockholm Local Transit Company), and shows the development of public transportation in the Stockholm area from the 1650s until today. The Museum's mission also covers contemporary and future public transport in the Stockholm region, and water transportation in the area. The museum also houses a library, an archive and a caf√©. In 2005 the Leksaksmuseet (Toy Museum) was added to the premises. The museum closed to the public in September 2017 and will reopen in early 2020 in a former gasworks building in the Hjorthagen neighbourhood. History Tramway manager Ernst Hjortzberg began collecting items around the turn of the 19th Century, when horse trams still ran on Stockholm's streets. A small private museum was at the company headquarters on Tegn√©rgatan. Among the first vehicles to be preserved was horsecar number 12, one of the first trams in Sweden. In 1944 the museum was opened to the public on Tulegatan, near an old tram depot. In 1964 the museum was moved to Odenplan metro station where horsecar 12 was displayed on the platform, but the space available was limited and it was not possible to have many exhibits. In 1990 the Sp√•rv√§gsmuseum relocated to a more suitable location at Tegelviksgatan 22, the ground floor of the S√∂derdep√•n tram and bus dep√¥t in S√∂dermalm. Much more of the collection was accessible to the public, and attractions included a mini-metro for children to ride. On September 10, 2017 the S√∂dermalm site closed as the S√∂derdep√•n dep√¥t was slated for demolition and redevelopment. Its new location, slated to open in 2020, is in Building 9 of the former V√§rtagasverket gasworks. The 1893 structure was designed by Ferdinand Boberg and was the scrubbing plant. Exhibits The museum owns approximately 60 trams, buses, trolleybuses, suburban rail and metro cars, most of which were located on site. Others are on the Liding√∂banan, Roslagsbanan, Saltsj√∂banan and in the metro, where they operate during special events, and on the Djurg√•rd line. The museum's collections also include an extensive drawing archive, photo collection and reference library. The permanent exhibit of vehicles and objects illustrated the history of public transport. The oldest vehicle in the collection is a horse omnibus, the so-called Wurst, probably built sometime in the 1840s. It is likely the oldest preserved public transit vehicle in Sweden.

The complex plot mixes terrorism, politics, corruption and sex in the convoluted politic environment during the Spanish transition to democracy. The film is notable for its lesbian subplot. It was classified S as pornographic for a nude scene in a sauna.Bentley, A Companion to Spanish Cinema, p. 235 Plot Rafael, a young man from the provinces, works as a waiter in a resort and helps himself economically having sex for money with rich older women. During a bomb threat, he is discovered in bed with one of the guest, Leonor Marchioness of Montenegro, and he is fired as a consequence. The Marchioness of Montenegro is an aging aristocrat, ruined economically, but still with wealthy and influential friends. She helps Rafael finds a new job in Madrid as the gardener in the mansion of Antonio Fern√°ndez Herrador, Minister of economy in the new democratic Spanish government. Rafael quickly adapts in his job as a gardener and befriends Chema, the son of Angelina the mansion's housekeeper. Chema explains to Rafael that Martha, the minister's secretary, is the most powerful person in the household. Rafael is brought to the notice of his employers when he suffers a mild injury during a botched attempt to the life of the minister. Immersed in his political career, the minister neglects his beautiful young wife, Teresa. Their marriage is going through a rough patch. Teresa, sexually frustrated with her husband's impotence, begins to pay attention to the attractive young gardener. Martha, a lesbian who actually lust after Teresa, has sex with Manuel before the young man becomes Teresa's lover under the watchful eyes of both Martha and the Marchioness of Montenegro. The Marchioness, who truly cares about Rafael, wants to take advantage of the situation. She offers her help to the lovers and her house becomes the retreat for Teresa and Rafael's intimate encounters. Soon after, the Marchioness presses the Minister Fern√°ndez Herrador to help her obtain a large bank loan necessary to save her from total economic ruin. The situation become murkier when a leftist terrorist group contact Rafael. They need the gardener's help in order to know the whereabouts of the Minister since they are planning his kidnapping. Rafael does not want to get involve and, afraid, tries to escape to his hometown, but the terrorist threaten him. Desperate, Rafael asks for help to the Marchioness since she still has powerful friends in the security forces loyal to the old regime. However, before she can do something, the terrorist, who have been following Rafael's every move, kill the Marchioness. Her assassination is considered political motivated since she was a well-known activist in right wing causes. Teresa becomes pregnant by her lover and wants to have the baby. She gives the news to Rafael who tells her about the terrorist and his certainty that they killed the Marchioness. Rafael and Teresa talk about it with Martha, who advises them to confess all to the Minister. The minister is outrage. He would like his wife to have an abortion, but she is determined to have the child. Confronted with his wife threats of divorce, the minister reluctantly accepts the situation since otherwise a scandal would ruin his political ambitions. The minister confines these problems to Lara, a member of the security forces. Lara assigns the investigation of the terrorist kidnapping threats to Romero, a hard-boiled detective linked with the security forces of the government. Romero interrogates Rafael, who identifies the terrorist through photographs. Soon after, the terrorist are killed by secret security agents of the government. Romero tells Rafael that the terrorist were killed in a settling of accounts among themselves. Lara and Romero meet to talk about the investigation, but during a brief absence by Romero, Lara is killed by a gunman. The plan to kidnap the minister is actually a hoax in which Fern√°ndez Herrador has been involved all along with Martha's complicity. The minister has accepted a three thousand million bribery deal from an international corporation interested in building five nuclear plants. Fern√°ndez Herrador's idea is to run away with the money to South America under the cover of a new identity. To all, he would have been killed by his kidnappers. Romero discovers the minister's plans and confronts him, but Fern√°ndez Herrador persuades Romero to accept money in exchange for his silence. Martha's motivation has been to have Teresa only for herself once the minister has escaped. She wants to kill Rafael, but Chema sees her threatening Rafael at gun point and Romero stops her. Perplexed at her husband's plan, Teresa tells all to Rafael, who has been an unwilling participant in the minister's plan. She encourages her lover to flee. The next day, Rafael hears the news on T.V that the Minister Fern√°ndez Herrador has been kidnapped. Rafael wants to buy a ticket to travel outside Madrid, but he is stopped by Romero. Romero says he has a job to offer him.

The Lost body Hypothesis tries to explain the empty tomb of Jesus by a naturally occurring event, not by resurrection, fraud, theft or coma. Only the Gospel of Matthew (28:2) mentions a ‚Äògreat earthquake‚Äô on resurrection day. The preceding crucifixion quake was accompanied by darkness, splitting of the rock and opening of graves (Matth. 27:51). In this way a crack in the rock can explain the empty tomb on resurrection day. The body of Jesus has fallen into a crevice produced by the earthquake and the crack closed again because of the aftershocks.Dale C. Allison, Resurrecting Jesus: The Earliest Christian Tradition And Its Interpreters (2005), p.204 Matthew might be hinting at the earthquake events in verse 12:40: the Son of Man descending for three days in the heart of the earth, like Jonah was in the whale‚Äôs belly. The Gospels of Mark and Luke do not mention a quake, but only darkness at noon, splitting of the temple veil and the tombstone rolled away. John in his Gospel (12:24) and Paul in his Letters (1 Cor.15:36) used the image of a grain of wheat falling in the earth for the event of death and resurrection of Jesus. 18th century According to the radical German rationalist and spiritualist Joh. Chr. Edelmann in his Confession of Faith (1746) the Matthean earthquake had buried the body and therefore it was lost. Edelmann combined his lost body hypothesis with a spiritual view on Jesus‚Äô resurrection. :‚ÄúAs to the last circumstance, which only Matthew mentions, I admit that the body of Lord Jesus in his grave could have been buried in such a way, that it could not have been found anywhere.‚ÄùJoh. Chr. Edelmann, ‚ÄúAbgen√∂thigtes, jedoch Andern nicht wieder aufgen√∂thigtes Glaubens-Bekenntni√ü‚Äù, (1746), p.196, translation of the German text 20th century The Austrian spiritualist, R.J.L. Steiner, in his article, The Fifth Gospel (1913), described what his \\"clairvoyant consciousness\\" saw as an earthquake that hid the body of Jesus: :‚ÄúThat earthquake shook the tomb in which Jesus' body lay ‚Äì and the stone which had been placed before the tomb was ripped away and a crevice opened in the ground and the body fell onto the crevice. Further vibrations caused the ground to close over the crevice. And when the people came in the morning the tomb was empty, for the earth had received Jesus' body; the stone, however, remained apart from the tomb.‚ÄùR. Steiner, The Fifth Gospel (Das F√ºnfte Evangelium, 1913) In 1925 the German theologist R. Seeberg seems to have entertained a lost body hypothesis as a possibility in his Christliche Dogmatik (Allison). Historicity of the Matthean earthquake The church father Origen has interpreted the Matthean earthquake as a historical but local, Judean phenomenon.Dale C. Allison, ‚ÄúStudies in Matthew: Interpretation Past And Present‚Äù, (2005), p. 89 A widespread 6.3 magnitude earthquake has been confirmed to have taken place between 26-36 AD in the time of Jesus.Jefferson Williams, Markus Schwab and A.

Biography Rosenberg grew up in Long Beach, New York, the son of a Holocaust survivor. His exposure to Jewish culture in New York played an influential role in his musical development. Throughout his career he would go on to incorporate elements of Jewish music into many of his projects. He moved to Boston to attend the Berklee College of Music, where he completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in film scoring in 1987. Early in his career, Rosenberg worked with the Boston Ballet as a rehearsal pianist. During his time in Boston, he also worked with musical groups Border Patrol and the Shirim Klezmer Orchestra.

A second bridge nearby, opened 1984, is referred to as Levensau Motorway Bridge (German: Levensauer Schnellstra√üenbr√ºcke).  Previous history  The lower section of the small river Levensau was extended between 1777 and 1784 to become part of the Eider Canal. Between 1887 and 1895 the Eider Canal was further extended and straightened to become part of the Kiel Canal (then Kaiser-Wilhelm-Kanal). The extended canal necessitated a fixed link for the Kiel‚ÄìFlensburg railway as well as the principal road from Kiel to Eckernf√∂rde. Design and construction Construction of the bridge took 1¬Ω years. Work on the abutments was started in June 1893 and bricklaying lasted until end of that year. On top of the abutments the bridge featured four towers by architect Hermann Muthesius. The scaffolding that supported the steel elements during construction was erected from November 1893 and assembly of the steel construction started in May 1894. The bridge was inaugurated by Emperor Wilhelm II in December 1894. Originally the carriageway was designed in such a way that it could not be used by road and rail traffic simultaneously - if a train approached, the bridge was closed for cars and lorries. In the course of a first modification a barrier between road and railway was installed, however this limited the width of the road to so that lorries were unable to pass each other on the bridge. Furthermore, the pedestrian way was only wide. In 1954, the bridge was extensively reworked to allow for independent use by road, rail and pedestrians. The towers were torn down and the carriageway was enlarged. Replacement In 1984 a four lane road bridge was opened for road traffic, taking over the role as main canal crossing for the Kiel‚ÄìSchleswig road (route 76). The current bridge is still used for the railway and local road traffic including bicycles. Its span is too narrow for the canal expansion to a width of .

They were introduced in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1843, three years after the first stamp was issued. They became common throughout the nineteenth century but very few remained in use until the twentieth century. The practice of cancelling a stamp on a letter with a device to prevent reuse and applying alongside, or on the reverse of the article, a dated stamp including the post office name, began in 1840 when postage stamps were introduced in the United Kingdom. Soon, in many countries, various systems developed where the obliterator had a code identifying the post office of origin. Most such codes were enclosed within a design of dots, rays, bars or concentric circles or ovals to ensure the effective cancellation of the stamp. Similar designs without an enclosed code are known as dumb or mute obliterators. Later the duplex canceller with the datestamp on the left and the obliterator on the right came into common use. Coded obliterators were used throughout the nineteenth century but few persisted to the twentieth century. Coded obliterations are collected by philatelists and rare examples can command high prices. Postal administrations which used coded obliterators include: United Kingdom and colonies Penny Red with a numeral \\"70\\" postmark of Boyle within the diamond shaped cancel as used in Ireland The first coded obliterators were numerals within a Maltese cross design used at the London mail centre from 1843. From 1844 distinctive and different barred designs were introduced for England, Scotland and Ireland. England and Wales numerals were within a circle of bars, while Scotland used a rectangular form and Irish codes within a barred diamond. Codes corresponding to London postal districts e.g. W21 were also used. =British Post Offices abroad= British stamps with a \\"C28\\" postmark of Montevideo, Uruguay Coded obliterators were used at many British post offices operating in foreign countries (mainly in Central and South America and the Ottoman Empire) using British stamps.

This cancel is only found on British stamps and the initial printing of Malta's first stamp, the Halfpenny Yellow. *The \\"A25\\" cancel was introduced in 1859 and it remained in use until 1904.

Some duplex obliterators were used. They were all withdrawn in 1873. France The obliterator was as a diamond or trapezoidal shaped grid of dots, measuring about 20 millimeters (0.75 inches) on each side, with a set of numbers at its center. The number consisted of anywhere between one and four digits, and was unique to the post office that used it. For this reason, such numbers are sometimes referred to by philatelists as \\"town numbers.\\" Two main types of the losange were used, the \\"losange √† petits chiffres\\" (small numbers) from 1852 to 1862, and the \\"losange √† gros chiffres\\" (large numbers) from 1862 to 1876. Distinguishing the two is based largely on the size of the numbers and the size of the dots in the cancel. The dots are noticeably smaller in the \\"losange √† petits chiffres\\" and its numbers measured approximately 4 millimeters high. Town numbers between 1 and 4494 are documented. Town numbers from 3704 to 4018 and 4222 indicate use at a French Post office abroad. The \\"losange √† gros chiffres\\" obliterator had numbers twice as big being nearly 8 millimeters tall. Since the overall size of the cancel remained the same, a larger portion of a large number obliterator consisted of the town number. The list of numbers used increased as the number of new post offices opened, with numbers known up to 6449. Town numbers 2387 and from 5079 to 5156 were those assigned to French post offices outside continental France. German states Bavarian stamp with a \\"269\\" postmark of Landshut Prior to unification, various German states had numeral obliterators: *Baden used numerals to 177. *Bavaria used numerals to 920. *Brunswick used numerals to 50. *Prussia used numerals to 1987. *Saxony used numerals to 220. *Schleswig used numerals to 42. *Thurn and Taxis used numerals to 424. Greece Large hermes head, Athens print (1862) cancelled with dotted rhombic obliteration. 1913 stamp of Greece cancelled with rural postman's rhombic obliteration. The Hellenic Post Office introduced numerically coded postal obliterations in October 1861, with the introduction of the first postage stamps. They were of rhombic (diamond) shape with the number of the post office at the center. In philatelic publications they are describes as Type I Classic Postmarks. A total of 150 different numbers can be found. The Type I obliterations were withdrawn in January 1881, so they are found only on Large Hermes definitives and on the first two issues of postage due stamps (1875/1876) of the period. After the founding of the rural postal service (1909), the rural postmen were initially equiped with diamond undated obliterators with the number of the service. These were later replaced with dated postmarks with the number of the service and a small postal horn at the bottom. The original coded obliterations were used until at least 1939. = Crete = Stamp of Crete (1900) cancelled with dotted rhombic obliteration \\"58\\". The post office of the Cretan State supplied every rural postman with a numerically coded obliteration. There were of diamond shape and were used from 1900 to 1907 to cancel the stamps on letters collected by the postman. Philatelic literature distinguishes four types of postmarks based on the number of dots per side (11, 12, 13 or 18). Guatemala Iceland Italy Mexico Netherlands and colonies Netherlands and its colonies Cura√ßao, Suriname and Dutch East Indies used a numeral series. Nicaragua Norway Portugal Russia Spain United States Uruguay Venezuela Venezuela used a series of barred numerals.

He competed at the 1968 and 1972 summer Olympics in the javelin and won a gold medal in the 1967 World Student Games and the 1970 Commonwealth Games. He was an international athlete from 1965 to 1978 and the British record holder for 4 years. Early life and school sport He was born in Strawberry Hill, south west London, in 1945 and lived for the first eleven years in East Twickenham, subsequently moving to Hinchley Wood near Esher. He attended Hampton Grammar School from 1957 to 1964 where his talent for sport was nurtured. He excelled at school athletics in a variety of events, making his debut at the English Schools Championships in 1960, placing second in the under 15 shot. Two titles in the javelin were achieved in 1963 and 1964, whilst also figuring in the winning sprint relay team for Middlesex Schools in 1962. His club career for Surrey Athletic Club included a British under 19 record of 70.70m in 1964. He left secondary school with national status in three disciplines: javelin, decathlon and rugby. Education and career He went on to study at Loughborough College from 1965 to 1968, gaining a Teaching Qualification and a First Class Diploma. From 1968 to 1990 he forged a career as a PE teacher and Pastoral Head, before going on to a sport development career which culminated in becoming Director of Sport in Education for Bristol City Council. In 1999 this work was recognised with a national Sportsmatch Award. Sport (javelin/decathlon) Following a successful schools athletic career, he made his senior international debut in the javelin in 1965 and was selected for the Empire Games in Jamaica in 1966. A year later in 1967 he won the World Student Games title in Tokyo and made the Olympic team in 1968 in Mexico City. He was coached at the time by Colin Smith, hitherto Britain‚Äôs most successful javelin thrower at international level. The main event in 1969 was the European Championships in Athens. Although placing only 9th, the best result yet for Britain in this event, it could have been much better with a throw ruled flat by the judges which would have won a bronze medal. 1970 was to prove his best year, setting a UK record of 82.22m in July, winning the Commonwealth Games title by almost 3 metres, and scoring a significant victory in the European Cup beating Janis Lusis, the Olympic champion and world record holder from Russia, with a British Record throw of 83.44 m. He maintained his domestic dominance through the early 70s - winning 7 AAA javelin titles from 1965 to 1974 - and gained a silver medal at the 1974 Commonwealth Games in New Zealand. Although regularly exceeding 80 metres in competition, his personal best remained the same despite qualifying 2nd in the European Championships in Rome with a throw of 82.38 m. He proved to be one of the most consistent UK javelin throwers recording 21 throws over 80m between 1969 and 1974. His decathlon career started in 1964 with a British junior record, and in 1965 he made his international senior debut setting a short lived UK record mark. In 1968 he attempted to qualify for both the javelin and decathlon for the Olympic Games in Mexico City but fell just short with a new personal best of 7,067 points. At the end of that season he left the decathlon behind to concentrate on the javelin. Sport (rugby union/weightlifting) He combined rugby with athletics at school and reached the top representative level. In 1963/4 he was selected for English Schools in matches against Wales (twice) and France as a wing three quarter, and in the selection trials he was selected ahead of David Duckham, who later went on to be a major figure in the English senior team. He represented Loughborough Colleges in 1965 playing outside the legendary Welsh player Gerald Davis but he halted his career that year to concentrate on athletics. A brief return to the game for the 1970/71 season for Richmond proved to be his last first class appearance, although later in life he represented Barker Butts RFC in the Warwickshire Cup Final at the age of 38. Alongside his athletics training, he developed an expertise in Olympic Weightlifting for the Twickenham and Sunbury clubs. This resulted in Middlesex and South East England titles with personal bests of 105 kg for the snatch and 135 kg for the clean and jerk. Sport (coaching) As his throwing days came to an end, he became involved in coaching with a group of throwers in Birmingham including Dave Ottley and John Trower, which led to a brief spell as National Event Coach. His guidance helped Dave Ottley to a silver medal at the 1984 Olympic Games and launched John Trower as a high level coach who would go on to assist Steve Backley and Mick Hill to international titles.

Life He was born in Usk, the son of Thomas Prothero, a lawyer who was involved also in local politics in Usk and the Beaufort estate. The supposition that he was illegitimate, based on his birthplace in the 1851 census for Malpas being entered simply as \\"Monmouthshire\\", is doubtful, given that the enumerator completed all entries in the same way. =Law and local politics= The younger Thomas Prothero began life in the same directions as his father. He set up in business in Newport, Monmouthshire; and he became town clerk of Newport in 1807. He was later joined in his law firm by Thomas Phillips, who became another influential local figure; they were in partnership from 1824 to 1840. Prothero and his law firm were drawn into the electoral politics of the two local constituencies, Monmouthshire and Monmouth Boroughs. =Land and political agent= He worked as agent for Sir Charles Morgan, 2nd Baronet M.P., both in politics and in management of the Tredegar Estate. The two were related: a local comment was that the antipathy Morgan's son Charles Morgan Robinson Morgan felt for Prothero was unjustified, because the younger Morgan was intending to stand for Parliament at Brecon, and Prothero's rent-gathering tactics in Monmouthshire would not matter there.historyofparliamentonline.org, Morgan, Charles Morgan Robinson (1792‚Äì1875), of Ruperra, Glam. and Tredegar, Mon.

As this conflict progressed, Prothero became an opponent of further reforms, and an opponent of Chartism. In the end he was an alarmist. His view that some Chartists in 1839 were intent on destroying the local gentry was, however, based on evidence of what some extremists were urging. The roots of the conflict were in a family quarrel, and the consequences of the will of William Foster; Frost was left with a debt to pay, in his view unfairly.http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-FROS- JOH-1784.htmlhttp://www.cleo.newport.gov.uk/PN/NewportNotes/Part1-TheTrialFrost&Prothero;/PartOnetrialFrostProthero.html Legal action for libel against Prothero led to Frost spending time in jail from 1822. Subsequently, both Sir Charles Morgan and Prothero were attacked in pamphlets by Frost.historyofparliamentonline.org, Monmouth 1820‚Äì1832. As part of his campaign, Frost also petitioned Parliament at the time of the 1826 Newport Improvement Bill; it passed against Frost's attacks, with the Morgan and Beaufort influence behind it. The feud flared up again after Frost became mayor of Newport in 1837. He accused Prothero of appropriating harbour dues; and again attacked Sir Charles Morgan. His stepson William Foster Geach was dragged into the conflict, accused by Prothero and Phillips of professional misconduct.G. D. H. Cole, Chartist Portraits (1841), p. 136.

By 1830 Prothero was announcing the use of a steam locomotive on the tramway run by the Monmouthshire Canal Company; there was a newspaper report of the delivery of a locomotive for Blancyffin Isha Colliery in June of that year.BackTrack Volume 19 (2005). It was the Speedwell, built by Neath Abbey Foundry.Abertillery and District Museum, Monthly Newsletter, February 2010. With Thomas Powell, Powell leased the coal under Plas Bedwellty in 1823, from John Hodder Moggridge.

One of the most decorated track and field athletes in Canada, Olsen still holds numerous provincial and national records in the javelin. Born in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Olsen's career began in 1970 while he attended Woodlands Secondary School. His meteoric rise started in 1973 with a gold medal performance at the Canada Summer Games in Burnaby, British Columbia. Olsen broke a world junior record and was named the most outstanding athlete of the Canada Games. That same year, Olsen also won the prestigious Viscount Alexander Award for being the outstanding junior athlete in Canada. In 1974 as a grade 11 student, Olsen won the BC high school javelin gold medal with a record throw that still stands today. Upon graduation from Nanaimo District Secondary School, Olsen was recruited by the University of Tennessee ‚Äî one of the elite track and field programs in the United States. During his brilliant four-year career at university, Olsen was a four-time All South Eastern Conference performer and four-time All-American. His college highlight was his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) gold medal championship performance in 1976. Olsen represented Canada on the international stage while attending Tennessee. As 11 times Canadian champion, Olsen represented Canada at many international events. At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Olsen's preliminary and qualifying throw of over 89 meters put him in the top three of the 37 competitors. He placed 11th in the finals the following day but at the age of 19 much more was to come. Following his senior season at Tennessee, Olsen represented Canada at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Alberta. His gold performance solidified his stature as one of the world's best javelin throwers. Queen Elizabeth presented Olsen with his gold medal. Only the boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Russia, stopped Olsen from possibly winning an Olympic medal. As the number three-ranked javelin thrower in the world at that time, Olsen had a legitimate chance of winning an Olympic medal. Olsen would go on to compete at the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, Australia, placing fourth. Only an injury to his right shoulder prevented him from competing at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California. He officially retired from the sport he loved in August 1985. In 1994 a panel of Canadian sports writers named Olsen the greatest javelin thrower in Canadian history. In 2008, Olsen joined Gerald Kazanowski and Brenda Taylor--among others--as inaugural inductees into his home town's Sports Hall of Fame. Olsen was NCAA champion and four-time All-American at the University of Tennessee. Olsen died 15 March 2020 in Nanaimo from a heart attack.

Though neither of these proposals were carried out, it had a siding that crossed Wading River-Manor Road toward a coal bunker, and was extended to the site of an LIRR Demonstration farm from 1905 to 1928. The other demonstration farm was east of Medford station on the Main Line. The station was originally a one-story structure that was converted to a two-story structure in 1906. Besides the previously mentioned coal bunker extension, it also had a siding on the south side of the tracks, for an engine house, smaller coal bunker and water tank.

Humberside was one of 35 probation trusts within England and Wales that were part of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and a department of the Ministry of Justice. Humberside Probation Trust employed 450 members of staff, and managed over 7,500 offenders each year. The caseload total at anyone time was approximately 4,500 offenders, and the trust wrote over 3,900 pre-sentence reports each year for the court. Vision and values The statement of purpose for Humberside Probation Trust was: ‚ÄúTo make the diverse communities safer by working with others to reduce re-offending, protect the public and support the victims of crime‚Äù. It was responsible for the delivery of reports about offenders to the courts and the supervision of offenders in the community. It also delivered programmes and interventions to rehabilitate offenders and reduce the chance of them committing crime in the future. In the community Humberside Probation Trust provided the following services to offenders based in the community: * Community Payback * Integrated Offender Management * Interventions * Offender Management * Programmes * Women Offender Services In courts Humberside Probation Trust staff worked in each of the Magistrates' Courts and Crown Courts. The trust provided a range of services both for the sentencers (Magistrates and Judges) and the offenders who appeared before the courts. When an offender pleads guilty, the Sentencer had the option to order a report from the probation trust. This was a formal report that included details on why the offence occurred, the circumstances, the offender's personal background and an assessment of the risk of harm and risk of reoffending they may have posed to the public. The Sentencer would then consider the report and the proposals made within it when making their sentencing decision. The report assisted the court to determine the most suitable way of dealing with the offender. Humberside Probation Trust staff were available within the Courts to handle enquiries and give advice to sentencers, including providing further verbal information to complement a written report. In prisons Humberside Probation Trust had some of its staff based in public and private sector prisons. These staff delivered a number of services and interventions which varied from prison to prison to suit the differing needs of the prison inmates. The work of Probation staff in each establishment was specified in a written agreement between the Governor and the chief executive officer. Prisons used the skills of Probation staff in working with offenders, particularly around risk assessment, risk management and the delivery of offending behaviour programmes. Prisoners were assessed for interventions according to their sentence plan and, if there was evidence of risk to the public being reduced, would in most cases transfer to category 'C' training prisons before release where they would receive resettlement support to help them return to the community without reoffending. As part of preparing for release, prisoners would learn new skills, complete educational courses, and complete offending behaviour programmes. Prisoners which are serving Life sentences may not ever be released. Public protection MAPPA is the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements ‚Äì a set of arrangements to manage the risk posed by the most serious sexual and violent offenders. A statutory requirement, they bring together the Police, Probation and Prison Services in Humberside into what is known as the MAPPA responsible authority. A number of agencies are under a duty to co-operate with the responsible authority. These include: Local Authority social services, Primary Care Trusts and strategic health authorities, Youth Offending Teams, local housing authorities, registered social landlords, local education authorities, Jobcentre Plus, and electronic monitoring providers. Following the closure of the Trust, Humberside, Lincolnshire & North Yorkshire Community Rehabilitation Company Ltd and the new National Probation Service continue to cooperate with MAPPA. The purposes of MAPPA are: * To ensure more comprehensive risk assessments, taking advantage of co-ordinated information sharing across the agencies, * and to direct the available resources to best protect the public. Closure Following the \\"Transforming Rehabilitation\\" criminal justice reform programme set out by the Ministry of Justice, Humberside Probation Trust dissolved on the 1 June 2014. In keeping with the reform programme, the Trust was divided between the Humberside, Lincolnshire and North Yorkshire Community Rehabilitation Company Ltd (HLNY CRC) and the new National Probation Service. Provision of probation services in Humberside is now provided by the collaborative efforts of these organisations.

Ordination In 1924, inspired by the sermons of Tibetan Buddhist monk Kyangtse Lama who was then visiting Kathmandu, Prem Bahadur followed him to Kyirong, Tibet where he was ordained as a Tibetan monk along with two other Newars. He was given the name Mahapragya. He returned to Kathmandu with one of the novices, and they lived on Nagarjuna hill with a lama named Tsering Norbu. Three of Mahapragya's friends joined them and also became monks. Into exile The people of Kathmandu were inspired by the sight of the men in ochre robes as they made their alms round. The Ranas didn‚Äôt like Mahapragya, born a Hindu, becoming a Tibetan monk, or the monks going around the city begging. In 1926, the five monks and Tsering Norbu were expelled to India.Studies in Nepali history and society, Volume 7, Issue 2 (2002). Kathmandu: Mandala Book Point. Page 230. The six went to Bodh Gaya where they became Theravada monks under a Burmese teacher. They then moved to Kolkata, and Mahapragya decided to travel to Tibet with Tsering Norbu to learn Buddhism. In Lhasa, Mahapragya met Kul Man Singh Tuladhar whom he convinced to become a Tibetan monk. Mahapragya and Kul Man Singh, now known as Karmasheel, wandered around Tibet and then went to Kushinagar, India in 1928 where they were reordained as Theravada monks. Karmasheel (who would later become known as Pragyananda Mahasthavir) returned to Kathmandu in 1930 as the first Theravada monk in Nepal since the 14th century. But Mahapragya, still under an expulsion order, could not enter the country. However, in March 1930 during the Maha Shivaratri festival, he slipped into Kathmandu disguised as a woman and blending with the throngs of Indian pilgrims. He returned to Kushinagar shortly for fear of detection. He then traveled to Burma where he lived in the jungle and varied monasteries before moving to Kalimpong, India in 1934.Mahapragya (2013).

Paraplegic Fundraiser Claire Lomas awarded MBE (born 28 April 1980) is a British campaigner, fundraiser and former event rider. She became a paraplegic as a result of a riding accident in 2007. In 2012, she finished the 32nd Virgin London Marathon in 17 days using the ReWalk robotic suit. Background Before 2007, Lomas worked as an event rider, producing and competing horses in Eye Kettleby, near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, UK. She competed at Advanced level in British Eventing.British Eventing investigates serious accidents http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/eventing/british-eventing-investigates-serious- accidents-121496 While competing at Osberton Horse Trials in Nottinghamshire on May 2007 she had an accident, colliding with a tree, which resulted in broken ribs puncturing her lungs and causing pneumonia; multiple fractures on her neck; and a spinal cord injury causing paralysis from the chest down. After a speedy recovery at the Sheffield Northern General Hospital's Spinal Injuries Unit, due to the spinal cord injury on T4 thoracic vertebrae Lomas was left without the use of her legs and lack of general sensation in lower part of her body. Despite the injuries that left her with paraplegia, her condition has improved rapidly due to medical rehabilitation treatments and being active in sports (gym exercising, horse riding, skiing and swimming). Lomas also credits the high level of support and understanding she receives from her husband Dan and becoming a mother as she gave birth to her daughter Maisie in February 2011. This progress and support stimulated Lomas not to become depressed but instead to run various campaigns and fundraising events publicly during 2008‚Äì2012 in order to acquire equipment for her rehabilitation and raise funds for research into spinal cord repair for the British charity Spinal Research, for which Lomas is an Ambassador for their Saddle Up Campaign for horse riders. After intensive and continuous rehabilitative exercising and therapy, Lomas reported she gained improvements in core strength. However, her lower body motoric abilities are still impaired and she has to use a wheelchair to stay mobile in everyday life. Achievements Lomas ran a fundraising campaign to raise ¬£50,000 for the charity Spinal Research to find a repair for spinal cord injury. This campaign promoted as Claire's Walk focuses around her participation in the 32nd Virgin London Marathon of 22nd April2012. She finished the Marathon in 17 days using the ReWalk robotic suit that helps people with paraplegia walk standing in upright position, on 8 May. On August 2011, Lomas announced launching a semi-nude photography calendar starring renowned event riders from Britain as a method of fundraising for purchasing the ¬£43,000 ReWalk suit.

Banerjea or K.C. Banurji, a Bengali convert to Anglican Church, was the founder of Calcutta Christo Samaj, a Christian parallel to Brahmo Samaj. K.C. Banerji was also one of the pioneers of Indian Christian movement, founder of the movement for emancipation, and was the finest orator in the whole assembly of Congress sessions. Biography He was born at Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh state where his father lived, and moved to Calcutta(present Kolkata) for education and made that city as his home for rest of his life. K.C. Banerjee was a lawyer by profession from Bengal, and was both a devout Christian and a prominent member of Congress in its early years. He taught reading and writing as a teacher to Brahmabandhab Upadhyay aka Bhabani[Bhawani] Charan Banerjee, a Roman Catholic; Hindu Sadhu(Sanyasi); and Bengali Catholic nationalist, related to K.C. Banerji, who happens to be the uncle of Upadhyay‚Äîhe laid the foundation for a Vedanta-based Christian theology, Vedantic Thomism - Upadhyay came to know Jesus Christ from his uncle Reverend Kalicharan Banerji and Keshub Chunder Sen, Brahmo Samaj and Naba Bidhan leader - he died prematurely as a prisoner, charged with sedition by Colonial government of Calcutta. =Congress leader= He being a fine orator and representative of Bengali Christian community, he joined the Indian National Congress(Congress) in 1885, and regularly addressed the Congress annual sessions in moulding the policy of national movement. Rev. Kalicharan Banerji along with G.C. Nath from Lahore, and Peter Paul Pillai from Madras(present Chennai), represented Indian Christians at the four sessions of the Congress between 1888 and 1891, and became a prominent leader in the Congress in the early years of formation. With regular participation in the annual sessions of Congress, he was able to influence and succeed in putting a number of proposals before the Colonial British government of Calcutta for administrative reforms. In 1889 Congress session, he was responsible for resolution demanding improvement in the educational systems, particularly University education‚Äîhigher education. He also presided over the grand meeting that discussed the advantages of the municipal elective system, of the Indian League‚ÄîThis seems, attracted Richard Temple, then-Lieutenant governor of Bengal - Temple then called Babu Shishir Kumar Ghose and discussed about his willingness to introduce elective system in municipal bodies. In 1889, he was instrumental in protesting against the prohibition of teachers participating in political movements, imposed by the Colonial British Raj in Calcutta. =Indian Christian leader= He strongly advocated for and defended the Indian Christian nationality in 1870. At the age of 25, he started a newspaper called The Bengal Christian Herald, later changed its name to The Indian Christian Herald. In his own words as reported in The Bengal Christian Herald: He was one of the active member of Bengal Christian Association, the first Christian organisation for promotion of Christian Truth and Godliness, founded in 1876 by a group of Christians in Calcutta with an intention of creating a national and independent Indian church. Krishna Mohan Banerjee was its first president. In 1877, he along with J.G. Shome created a forum by organizing the Bengali Christian conference to present their programme. They criticized the missionaries of denationalizing the Indian Christians and making them into compound converts: A group of Christians under the leadership of K.C. Banerjee and J.G. Shome left their churches and founded Calcutta Christo Samaj in competition to Brahmo Samaj at Calcutta in 1887 that has no clergy, but affirmed only the apostles creed. Their purpose was to propagate the Christian truth and promote Christian union. They intended to garner all Indian churches together and thereby eliminate denominationalism. He being a Protestant Christian, a group of nationalist leaders who associated themselves with the Indian National Congress perceived that \\"Christianity in India was full of stagnant Western waters and could be cleansed only through Indian Christian literature.\\"‚Äîthe attempts of Protestant Christians to indigenize Christianity created rift between Protestants and Catholics leading to establishment of non- denominational missionary organizations; consequently, in 1887, he along with Shome founded the Calcutta Christo Samaj. K.C. Banerjee later changed his attire to wearing the clothes of Sannyasin, and moved closer to Scottish missionaries in Bengal; his association with Scottish missionaries in Bengal brought closer and impressed Scottish missionaries in Madras too, especially Madras Christian College‚Äîthen-epicenter of the \\"Re-thinking Christianity in India Group\\". The Re-thinking Group of Madras, asserted that the missionary emphasis on institutions like Church in India was not wise and reiterated that Christianity must understand the spiritual genius of India, forms of worship, and categories of thought so as to take root in the Indian soil; as a result, development of spirituality through Bhakti tradition, and inculturation of the Christian faith through the avatar entered into their religious affairs. Kalicharan Banurji along with Shome representing Bengali Christians participated in a decennial missionary conference at Calcutta in 1882, and in Re-thinkers assemblage at Bombay(present Mumbai) in 1892 strongly advocating for united and single Indian church‚Äîone, not divided, native, not foreign. In the Bombay conference, he presented a paper entitled \\"The Native Church - Its Organization and Self Support\\"‚Äîan excerpt of that paper: Kalicharan Banerjee and Tamilians like Parani Andi(known also as Pulney Andy), V.S Azariah, P. Chenchiah, and K. T. Paul were credited for being the pioneers in reformulating \\"Rethinking Movement in Indian Christianity\\"‚Äîindigenous mission reflecting the cultural heritage of India and stand aloof from Western cultural domination‚ÄîRe-thinking in the context of developing Indian expressions of Biblical life and faith against the traditional patterns implanted by Western minds. As a result, The National Church of Madras in 1886, The Christo Samaj of Calcutta in 1887, The Marthoma Evangelical Association of Kerala in 1888, and The Hindu Church of the Lord Jesus in Tinnevelly in 1903 were seen as the first attempts to create indigenous missions by Indian Christian community in India. In spite of Church organisation becoming a Rethinking group in 1877 and then into a new Church movement in 1887, Calcutta Christo Samaj survived only for few years since \\"non-denominational Indian church\\" failed to overtake the already well- established missionary churches with solid foundation and adequate local resources, long before. According to B.R. Barber, biographer of K.C. Banurji: Gandhi Vs Kalicharan Banerji Gandhi, having told his Christian friends in South Africa that he would meet the Christian Indians and acquaint himself with their condition; accordingly, Gandhi while taking shelter at Gokhale's residence, decided to visit Babu Kalicharan Banerji, whom Gandhi held high regard as he took a prominent part in Congress in spite of isolating himself from Hindus and Mussalmans. When Gandhi went to Kalicharan's home, Mrs. Kalicharan was on her death-bed, and in his own words: Gandhi, having grasped the concept of Hinduism and also the traditions he was following, he seems to have pulled by the attractiveness of the example of Jesus; accordingly, in 1901, he made one determined effort to see if Christianity was the path he should follow. In 1925, when presenting to Christian missionaries, he described this step, which involved going to see Indian converted Christian Kali Charan Banerjee: See also * Niralamba Swami * Nabo Bidhan or New Dispensation References * External links * Autobiography Pandit Ramabai - Woman of the Millennium * Indian Christian, Kali Charan Banerjee (1847-1902) Category:1847 births Category:1902 deaths Category:Indian Christian theologians Category:Bengali people Category:Indian National Congress politicians from West Bengal Category:People in Christian ecumenism Category:Anglicanism in India Category:Politicians from Kolkata Category:19th- century Indian politicians Category:Christian clergy from Kolkata ","title":"Kali Charan Banerjee"},{"id":"35808789","text":"Saint Gregory the Theologian The Liturgy of Saint Gregory the Theologian (or Anaphora of Saint Gregory) is one of the three Anaphoras retained by the Coptic Church. The text is named after Saint Gregory of Nazianzus, one of the Cappadocian Fathers. The anaphora or Eucharistic Prayer that is part of this liturgy is distinct as it is entirely addressed to Christ and not to the Father as anaphoras usually are. Use This liturgy can be used at present by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, as well as by the Coptic Catholic Church, in the solemnities of the Coptic calendar. This text doesn't cover the whole Divine Liturgy, but it extends only from the pre-anaphorical rites to the Fraction, so including the anaphora in the strict sense of the word. Along with this section the Liturgy of Saint Gregory includes also other additional prayers which can be used in place of the ones of the Coptic Liturgy of Saint Basil. History This liturgical text derives from the West Syriac Rite, being imported in Egypt after the 6th-century from Syriac monks who settled in Wadi El Natrun. The authorship of the core of this anaphora by Gregory of Nazianzus himself cannot be excluded. The text however was adapted to the Egyptian use, and it was one of the three anaphoras which use was permitted by the canons of Patriarch Gabriel II in the 12th century. The oldest manuscripts of this liturgy date the High Middle Ages: the oldest is a 10th-century Sahidic incomplete manuscripts from the euchologion of the White Monastery, while the earlier Bohairic texts are 12th or 13th manuscripts from the Monastery of Saint Macarius. Also a Byzantine Greek recension exists. Structure of the anaphora The Anaphora of Saint Gregory the Theologian follows the Antiochene (or \\"West Syriac\\") structure, which can be so summarized: *Pre-anaphoric rites: **the Prayer of the Veil **the Prayer of Reconciliation *Anaphora: **the Opening Dialogue **the Preface, glorifying Christ and giving thanks to him for the creation. **the Pre-Sanctus, introducing the Sanctus, first asking to unite with the heavenly Angelic liturgy, and later glorifying Christ with the choir of angels, **the Sanctus, conducted with the Benedictus, **the Post-Sanctus, recalling the whole history of Salvation, from the Original Sin to the Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection of Christ, **the Oblation, offering to the Lord the Eucharistic bread and wine, **Institution narrative, **the Anamnesis, referring to the Passion, Resurrection and Second Coming of Christ, **the Epiclesis, asking Christ to convert the Eucharistic bread and wine with his voice, and also to send the Holy Spirit on them in order to purify them and to make them the Body and Blood of Christ, **the Intercessions, praying for the Church, for the livings (including the diptychs for current pope, bishop and other members of the Church), *the Fraction, **introduction **the prayer of submission to the Son **the absolution of the Son Notes External links *Online text of the Liturgy of St. Gregory as used at present by the Coptic Church * Category:Eastern Christian liturgies Category:Anaphoras (liturgy) Category:Coptic Orthodox Church ","title":"Anaphora of Saint Gregory"},{"id":"35808821","text":"Michael Gaismair, (1490, Sterzing, County of Tyrol ‚Äì 15 April 1532, Padua, Republic of Venice) was a leader of the German Peasants' War (1524-1525) in Tyrol and the Salzburg region.  Life  Michael Gaismair was the son of a mining entrepreneur,Aldo Stella, Il Bauernf√ºhrer, Michael Gaismair e l'utopia di un repubblicanesimo popolare, il Mulino, 1999 () who became secretary of the powerful bishop of Brixen. In 1525 he came in contact with the ideas of the Anabaptists Felix Manz and J√∂rg Blaurock, who worked in the Eisacktal and Graub√ºnden and soon afterwards, in May, he received news of the German Peasants' War in Germany, and the activities in Saxony of the radical preacher Thomas M√ºntzer, who shared some ideas with the Anabaptists. Shortly hereafter Tyrol which was under Habsburg rule became a powder keg of popular uprisings, especially in the Eisacktal and Puster Valley. These peasant revolts were captained by a certain Peter Passler and Gaismair: Brixen and Neustift were occupied and looted. The rebels, reinforced by local miners and survivors of the Battle of Frankenhausen, resisted the Habsburg army counterattacks. Gaismair dreamed of founding a democratic republic in the area, he envisaged the abolition of the Catholic Church and its rituals, replaced by a faith based on a direct contact with God, through the personal interpretation of Scripture. He also envisioned a utopian elimination of titles of nobility, the nationalization of land and mines, the establishment of schools, hospitals, old people‚Äôs homes etc. To overcome the differences the leaders of the revolt were invited to the regional diet of Innsbruck (June 1525) by Crown Prince Ferdinand of Habsburg (b. 1503, Emperor 1558‚Äì1564). Gaismair also went there, but in August he was jailed for treason. After two months, he managed to escape, travelling to Graub√ºnden, Switzerland. Gaismair established contact with the Swiss reformer Ulrich Zwingli, with the plan of a new democratic order in Tyrol and Salzburg by the example of Grisons and Venice. Among other things, by the disappointing experience of the parliamentary debates Gaismair evolved from reformer (Summer 1525) to revolutionary social rebel (1526). In his draft of a new order of Tyrol in May 1526 Gaismair designed an egalitarian, democratic, Christian state. Gaismair again gained followers, and in the spring of 1526 assisted the revolt of the peasants in Salzburg. Despite the victories on the field, Gaismair and his army were forced to retreat through the territory of the Republic of Venice, then at war with the Habsburgs. The Bauernf√ºhrer (head of the farmers), as Gaismair was called, then turned to the Doge Andrea Gritti (1523‚Äì1538) to convince him to support a military revolt in Tyrol, but he failed in his intent. He died in 1532 in Padua, in Prato della Valle (where there is a plaque in his memory) murdered at the hands of two soldiers who wanted to collect the bounty placed on his head by Ferdinand I. The movement of Gaismair was then done, but not the religious turmoil of Tyrol, which in the same years saw the development of Anabaptist preaching by Jakob Hutter. Historiography Because of his struggle against Church and Monarchy, Gaismair was ignored by historians of his time. In the twentieth century, his figure got more purchasing reputation, coming in first by the Communist (Community dell'afflato by inspiring his statutes, and that was pointed out by none other than Friedrich Engels), and by the Nazis (which emphasized his fight against the Earl of Salamanca, a Jewish adviser to Ferdinand). It is only since the second half of the twentieth century that scholars have tried to evaluate the story of Michael Gaismair from a nonideological perspective, especially promoted by the Michael Gaismair Gesellschaft (Society Michael Gaismair), founded in 1976. Plays inspired by the figure of Michael Gaismair In 1899 Franz Kranewitter, a Tyrolean author of patriotic dramas, wrote a play dedicated to the figure of the rebel, named Michel Gaissmayr. In the summer of 2001, at the theatre festival Tiroler Volksschauspiele, a drama was staged dedicated to the rise and fall of Gaismair by the Austrian author Felix Mitterer.

It was heard in the Appellate Division on 19 March 1976, with judgment handed down on 27 September. The judges were Wessels JA, Jansen JA, Corbett JA, Kotz√© JA and Viljoen AJA. The case is especially important in the law of delict, dealing with the problems relating to causation and the conditio sine qua non or \\"but-for\\" test. Where there was a negligent delay in furnishing medical aid and treatment to the deceased, whose widow established, on a balance of probabilities, that he would not have died \\"but for\\" such delay, the court held that she was entitled to damages.  Facts  In the Transvaal Provincial Division, Skosana had successfully claimed damages on behalf of herself and her minor children resulting from the death of her husband, \\"T,\\" in the following circumstances. T, whilst heavily under the influence of intoxicating liquor, had driven his motor car off the road and landed in a ditch, as a result whereof he, together with Skosana and two other passengers, had been injured. The passengers had been removed in an ambulance, but \\"T\\" had been removed in a police van to the charge office and from there to the consulting rooms of the district surgeon, who had performed a clinical examination and taken a blood sample. At that stage, \\"T\\" had only complained of a pain in the chest. Although he had been examined thoroughly, no sign of internal injury could be detected. When the cells were opened next morning, at 7.45 am, he complained of quite a severe pain over the abdomen and requested to be taken to a doctor. At 9.45 am, he walked with the constable to the district surgeon's consulting rooms where he was immediately examined. The district surgeon wrote a note for the hospital and instructed the constable to arrange for his being taken there. There was a further delay of two hours before the ambulance arrived. At the hospital, \\"T\\" was found to be in a very serious condition. An attempt was made to resuscitate him for operation, but his condition remained poor. When it was found impossible to resuscitate him further, a laparotomy was performed. The viscus was found to be ruptured with severe generalised peritonitis. The ruptured small bowel was sutured and a drain inserted. Although he had only been lightly anaesthetized, he failed to \\"wake up\\" and died shortly after leaving the theatre.  Principles  Causation in the law of delict gives rise to two distinct problems. The first is a factual one, relating to the question of whether or not the negligent act or omission in question caused or materially contributed to the harm which gave rise to the claim. If it did not, no legal liability can arise and cadit quaestio; if it did, the second problem becomes relevant: whether the negligent act or omission is linked to the harm sufficiently closely or directly for legal liability to ensue, or whether, as it is said, the harm is too remote. This is basically a juridical problem in which considerations of legal policy may play a part. The test, otherwise known as that of causa (conditio) sine qua non, is whether or not, but for the negligent act or omission of the defendant, the event giving rise to the harm would have occurred. Generally speaking, the Appellate Division found, no act or condition or omission may be regarded as a cause in fact unless it passes this test.  Judgment  The court a quo held that the constables concerned, acting within the course of their duty and within the score of their employment, had been negligent * in not immediately summoning the district surgeon; and * in not causing him to be taken to hospital immediately thereafter. The court awarded damages in an agreed amount. In an appeal, it was accepted that the prime cause of death was the occurrence in which \\"T\\" sustained his bowel injury, which in turn resulted in peritonitis. The Appellate Division held that Skosana, the respondent, had established negligent delay in furnishing the deceased with medical aid and treatment in the aforesaid respects, and held further that the respondent had established, as a matter of probability, that the deceased would have survived if the operation had been performed nearly five hours earlier, as it would have been, regard being had to a shorter period of resuscitation being necessary, but for the negligence of the constables. (Jansen JA and Viljoen AJA dissented here.) The decision in the Transvaal Provincial Division, in Skosana v Minister of Police, was thus confirmed.

They like to play, making this breed very active and curious. They are good hunters, quick and agile. Cats that are allowed to go outdoors will easily catch prey and bring it back home. These cats easily jump and jump high. Outdoor cats like to walk around their territory and their house; Arabian Mau are a very territorial breed. Males always guard their territory from other male cats.  Health  The Arabian Mau breed has good health generally, as it is a natural breed. Kittens are born strong and healthy, as the cats have a good immune system. Both pedigree cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature.

He set a PawSox record with 24 home runs in a season that year. On May 13, 2012, G√≥mez was called up to the Red Sox when Darnell McDonald went on the disabled list, and after Jacoby Ellsbury was moved to the 60-day disabled list. G√≥mez made his Major League debut that afternoon as a defensive substitution at first base for Adri√°n Gonz√°lez and struck out in his only plate appearance. He was optioned to Pawtucket on May 20 after making two pinch-hit appearances.

He was released on November 14 without playing a game in the Washington organization. He was released to sign with Japan, by his request. =Hanshin Tigers= G√≥mez signed with the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball on November 18, 2013 and was assigned the jersey no. 5. Due to unfortunate circumstances however, he had a somewhat delayed introduction to Japan. He was scheduled miss to the first few days of spring camp in order to be with his family for the birth of his daughter. His arrival was further delayed when his child fell ill and was in the hospital a few days. He made his NPB debut on the March 28 opening night, going 2-for-4, with two RBIs. Gomez put to rest any concerns on whether he could make a smooth transition by hitting .327 with four homers and 33 RBIs in his first month. He then went on to reach base at least once in each of the first 27 games of the season, breaking the franchise record of 24 that had been held by Yutaka Wada, the Tigers‚Äô current manager, since 1997. He hit a brief slump during mid- season, but returned to his slugging ways in August, leading the Tigers with 25 doubles, 19 home runs, 83 RBIs and a .506 slugging percentage. Together with Matt Murton, the Hanshin's clean-up duo started growing beards in June reviving memories of famously bearded Hanshin legend Randy Bass, who led the team to its only Japan Series title in 1985. He said once he has hit 20 home runs, perhaps he‚Äôll shave off the beard. In the September 20 game against Chunichi, he scored 2 singles and a solo homer, and became the first foreign player in franchise history to record over 100 RBI in their first year in the NPB. He is 17th foreign player in NPB history to record 100 or more RBI in his first year in the NPB, first since Tony Blanco notched 110 in 2009. He joined Randy Bass (134 in 1985, 109 in 1986), George Arias (107 in 2003), and Craig Brazell (117 in 2010) as the only foreign Hanshin players to notch 100 or more RBI in a season. He finished the season with 109 runs including 26 homers, and won the RBI title and Best Nine Award in his first NPB season. Gomez played a key role as the Tiger's clean-up hitter during the postseason Climax Series against their archrivals Yomiuri Giants. Out of the 22 runs scored during the series, he drove in 8 - including a 2-run homer in his first at-bat at Tokyo Dome, and set a new Central League record for Climax Series RBIs. He helped secure the Tigers a spot in the Japan Series, their first participation since 2005. His performances were worse in the following two seasons, and in November 2016 he was released by the club. In January 2017 he had contract negotiations for the Korean Samsung Lions, but the club refused to close the deal after Gomez failed his medical test with problems regarding his knees.

Initially it was announced by Rovio's CEO Mikael Hed on Yle's breakfast television. The game was based on Casey's Contraptions, a game created by Noel Llopis (Snappy Touch) and Miguel √Ångel Friginal (Mystery Coconut), whose rights were acquired by Rovio. The game featured educational elements and revolved around Alex, described as a curious boy with interest in building things. The goal of the game was to make various Rube Goldberg-type chain reaction machines work. The game was very similar to The Incredible Machine, originally released in 1993. On April 13, 2015, the game was removed from the App Store and Google Play. Gameplay The general premise of the game is for the player to get the ball to the goal (Usually a basket) by placing objects such as pipes, buckets, spring loaded boxing gloves, seesaws etc. into the playing area.

He competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics in the 100 m, but failed to reach the final. In 1960 he finished in fourth place in the long jump, setting his personal best at 8.00 m. Shortly before the Olympics, in July 1960 he jumped 8.14 m, 1 cm above the 1935 record by Jesse Owens, but this jump was discounted because of lacking wind measurement. He set another, officially recognized world record in August 1958, by running the 4√ó100 m relay in 39.5 seconds together with Martin Lauer, Heinz F√ºtterer and Manfred Germar. Steinbach was born and raised in East Germany, but in April 1958 fled to West Germany, following his parents who did so in 1953. After that his coach was accused of complicity and imprisoned. In 1959 Steinbach graduated from a medical school in G√∂ttingen. Two years later he became a professor of sports medicine in Mainz. In 1967 he ended his sports career and worked at the Summer Universiade in Tokyo as the German team doctor. From 1973 to 1993 he served on the board of the German Athletics Federation, and between 1965 and 1970 headed the Institute of Sports Medicine of the University of Mainz. In 1970 he moved to Wiesbaden, where until 1977 he served as Assistant Secretary at the Ministry of Social Affairs. From 1977 to 6 October 1993 he was head of the pharmacy and drugs department at the Ministry of Health. He had to resign after a scandal, in which ministry officials concealed hundreds of HIV cases resulted from transfusion of contaminated blood. Later, between 1999 and 2008 he was president of the Deutscher Heilb√§derverband (German Spa Association) and subsequently its honorary president. He also continued to be a professor of sports medicine and first aid at the University of Darmstadt.
