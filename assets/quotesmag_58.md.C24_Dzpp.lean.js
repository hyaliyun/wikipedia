Content The song speaks of holding on to a relationship despite all the disappointments it brings. The speaker, who understands that the relationship is falling apart but doesn't want to end it just yet, tries to brush off the negative emotions he/she is experiencing. However, he/she is still incapable of \\"letting it slide\\". Music video Music Director - The Malloys The music video of the song features comedian Patton Oswalt as Carl where he wears a corn dog costume. The video starts where the band is seen performing in a warehouse and then Carl is seen waking up after a bad day, goes to get the newspaper but the paperboy throws the newspaper at his face and when he looks at it, the headlining news says that \\"Corn Dog Hut Fires Carl\\". With a sad face full of regrets he remembers the days when everyone respects him in the hut. He did commercials for them and was treated as VIP. He got the girls and he seemed to be rich. But he goes way over headed with things and starts getting drunk at the pool, annoys other people and swim's in the pool in the costume and the security throws him out. He ends up near the garbage where a street dog wakes him up as the dog starts licking his face. He seems more frustrated and goes crazy. In the ending he sees his postures being replaced and the winery hut guy (in a pizza costume) with his girlfriend sees Carl around their place and they make a laugh at his life and drive away. The video ends but it shows in lines that Carl recently got married and gave birth to a Jumbo Dog. His career had never fully recovered but he was slated to star in an episode of VIP that fall.

The Brighton Belle was a named train which was operated by the Southern Railway and subsequently by British Rail from Victoria Station in London to Brighton, on the Sussex coast. Commissioned as the flagship of the Southern Railway's mass electrification project, which commenced in January 1931, the world's only electric all-Pullman service ran daily between London Victoria and Brighton from 1 January 1933 until 30 April 1972. History The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) began using Pullman cars in its express trains in 1875, and in December 1881 they introduced the first all-Pullman train in the UK. Known as the Pullman Limited, this ran between London Victoria and Brighton via Horsham and subsequently ordinary rolling stock was added to the service. In 1888 a second all-Pullman service was instituted, using cars lit by electricity and designed by William Stroudley.Owen, Nicholas, The Brighton Belle, Southern Electric Group: Preserved Pullmans , Southern Electric Group (1972), p9 The LB&SCR; was the origin of the British umber and cream Pullman livery. In 1903 R. J. Billinton changed the colour of the ordinary LB&SCR; coaches to umber brown with white or cream upper panels, and in 1906 this colour scheme was also adopted by the Pullman Car Co., with the name of the car in large gilt letters on the lower panel and flanked on each side by a coloured transfer of the Pullman Company's crest. Another all-Pullman service was introduced in 1908 under the name of the Southern Belle. Contemporary advertising by the LB&SCR; claimed that this was \\"... the most luxurious train in the world...\\". In 1908 this could be experienced for a special London Victoria to Brighton day return fare of 12 shillings, a premium rate at a time when average earnings were around ¬£1 a week (or 20 shillings). The Southern Belle was steam hauled until 1 January 1933, when electric units were introduced. Trial trains had commenced running between London and Brighton on 2 November 1932, using an experimental five-coach unit (No. 2001) and examples of the new rolling stock were exhibited at London Victoria and Brighton stations from 29 December 1932.Ford, Antony, \\"Pullman Profile No. 4 - The Brighton Belle & Southern Electric Pullmans\\" Noodle Books (2013) With the arrival of the mid-day Victoria to Brighton service at Brighton Station on 29 June 1934, the Mayor of Brighton, Margaret Hardy, renamed the train the Brighton Belle, and it retained this title until withdrawal. The service was scheduled to take 60 minutes for the 51-mile express journey. Three five-car all-Pullman electric multiple units designated 5-BEL were commissioned by the Southern Railway as the flagship of the world's then-largest electrification project, which covered over 160 track miles. The 15 cars ‚Äì built in 1932 by Metropolitan-Cammell at its Saltley works in Birmingham ‚Äì were operated in trains comprising two units, the remaining unit normally held in reserve. The 'spare' multiple unit set was used for a Sunday Pullman service from Eastbourne, known as the Eastbourne Pullman for much of the 1950s, but this service was discontinued in 1957. During the Second World War the service was suspended after Unit 3052 was badly damaged by aerial bombing at London Victoria; all cars were placed in safe storage at Crystal Palace (High Level) station, but the service was progressively reinstated in 1946. In the early 1950s the train was used by the BBC for filming London to Brighton in Four Minutes, a speeded up version of the journey. The trains were refurbished and overhauled in 1955, but by 1972 the stock was old and rode poorly by contemporary standards. Despite protests,Dunstone, Denis, For the Love of Trains, Ian Allan, (2007) the decision was taken to not replace the rolling stock and the service was withdrawn on 30 April 1972. Every car was preserved, in most cases to meet the ambitions of major breweries to 'bolt on' Pullman restaurants to pubs and hotels, although most were removed relatively quickly because of the high cost of maintenance and refurbishment.\\"Farewell to the Belle\\".

A campaignCoupe News (Journal of Pullman Car Services) No. 66, pp 24‚Äì25 to return the Brighton Belle to mainline service was launched by the 5-BEL Trust in 2009. The trustees had been concerned for some time about the worrying state of electric train preservation in Britain and wanted to raise the profile of the issue and to deal with the issues of financial support and covered accommodation. The project was launched at the National Railway Museum following the acquisition of two of the surviving 14 cars; by early 2009 four out of the five cars needed to form a complete unit had been acquired and the trust had set in place agreements to cover refurbishment of the cars, which began at Pullman restoration specialists Rampart Engineering at the Barrow Hill Engine Shed in February 2009. When the 5-BEL project is completed, it will be returned to mainline service. Despite the high cost of the restoration (approaching ¬£6 million) the programme is seen as an investment for future generations. Progress with the restoration of the Brighton Belle to mainline use will depend in part on the level of public donations. This is the first time that a complete train will have been restored in Britain.5BEL Trust Newsletter, March 2014 A short train of three cars will undergo mainline proving trials in the near future, with mainline excursions with a four car unit commencing upon testing success.[Heritage Railway magazine April 2015] The latest expectation is for testing on the rails in spring 2020 so that charter and public runs might commence a few months after. Train unit completed Brighton Belle Car 88 on display in Brighton for the first time in 40 years to celebrate the acquisition of the fifth car needed to form a complete Belle unit. Pullman First Class Car 'Hazel' had been continuously used as a restaurant attached to the 'Black Bull' at Moulton, Yorks, since 1972. It took two enormous mobile cranes to perform the delicate removal operation on 10 August 2012. During February 2011, Driving Car 88 was displayed on the Brighton seafront to celebrate the acquisition of the Trust's fifth car.Railway Herald The fifth 5BEL car required was Pullman First Doris, then based at the Bluebell Railway for the Bluebell's pullman rake, and thus a swap was arranged. The 5-BEL Trust had purchased Golden Arrow Pullman Kitchen Car Carina and supplied this to the Bluebell railway in exchange for Doris, allowing the Bluebell Railway to complete a five-car all-Pullman Golden Arrow rake. Carina is of considerable heritage importance, having formed part of Winston Churchill's funeral train which carried the principal mourners from London to Bladon on 30 January 1965. The 5-BEL Trust said at the time that acquiring Doris as the trust's fifth car was not only the right move from a heritage standpoint but also it demonstrated the benefits of like-minded organisations working together. The following year, on 6 September 2012, the 5BEL Trust announced that, following two years of complex negotiations with the owners of the Black Bull at Moulton, near Richmond, it had purchased Pullman first 'Hazel' (no. 279) the previous month and had removed the car by road to the Brighton Belle shed at Barrow Hill. The car had been in continuous use as a highly praised restaurant since 1972 and her removal was an extremely delicate operation, involving the use of two of the largest mobile cranes in Britain. The acquisition of a second first class car, originally considered as an impossible outcome, permits the correct unit configuration of two motor brakes, two trailer kitchen firsts and a trailer parlour third, with a trailer held in reserve.

A Salvation Army brass band is a brass band affiliated with a Corps, Division or Territory of the Salvation Army. In society, a Salvation Army band playing in public places during Christian events in the calendar such as Christmas has become a part of seasonal customs, particularly in the UK. Purpose of Salvation Army bands today The primary purpose of all Salvation Army bands is to serve as an instrument to proclaim the Christian gospel. All other activities and functions of the band are only considered proper when this ultimate goal is observed. Within the framework of the primary purpose, a brass band can be a powerful evangelistic tool. The judicious choice of music for a worship service can set the mood and enhance the message, preparing a congregation for the desired experience. Music is also a means to attract and hold members to the movement. Many individuals were originally introduced to The Salvation Army through the music programs. Others would have strayed from the cause if not for their interest in brass bands. Service provided by musicians often far exceeds just playing an instrument - most band members also serve in other roles in the corps. The brass band is also an excellent means of drawing attention for fund-raising and publicity. Participation in public and civic events raises awareness of The Salvation Army and its mission in many communities. The brass band also provides a source of fellowship for the players. In some cases, the primary purpose of a group is stated as fellowship, which is considered important part of worship for many believers. History The early Salvationists, as today, took their Gospel message to the people in their own environments, largely in the streets and markets of the towns. In 1878 Charles Fry and his three sons formed a brass quartet which played during outdoor meetings. The Army's founder, William Booth, came to hear of them, and started to use them in his own campaign. Over time the Fry ensemble was augmented with other instruments, not exclusively brass, and became famous under names such as \\"The Hallelujah Minstrels\\" and \\"The Happy Band\\". The Fry family themselves very soon gave up their family business and joined the Salvation Army full-time. The first ever Salvation Army Corps Band was formed in December 1879 in Consett, County Durham, a former steelworking town, another followed later in Northwich, Cheshire in 1880. It was not long before the Army fully adopted the use of music in its work, and the Salvation Army Headquarters eventually established the International Staff Band, its flagship ensemble, in 1891. Gradually the bands developed into the same basic format as the traditional amateur brass band and a rich repertoire of music was adapted, arranged and composed for the Salvation Army specifically. Many of the leading brass band composers and players of the 20th century had roots in or close links with the Salvation Army. Influences on secular brass bands The Salvation Army kept itself apart from the secular brass band world. They did not enter contests or play music other than their own - which had been specifically written or arranged for them. Secular tunes were used, but arranged to reflect the spiritual work they supported. Around the same time that the Salvation Army bands were forming the temperance movement was also using brass bands to promote its message. These, however, were integrated with the other amateur brass bands - and the vestiges of their influence can still be seen in the names of some of the bands today. The Salvationist movement in recent years has opened up its doors to its colleagues in the secular brass band world, thereby making a rich resource of music available for other bands to play. Instrumentation Brass bands in the British tradition are limited to cornets, flugelhorns, tenor horns (known as alto horns in U.S.A), baritones, trombones, euphoniums, tubas (known as basses in brass bands), and percussion; but not trumpets or French horns, since they are orchestral and concert band instruments. With the exception of the bass trombone and percussion, all parts are transposing and written in the treble clef, which means that for every instrument, the fingering for the written notes is the same. This system, which is unique to UK-style brass bands, ensures most parts can be covered when there is less than a full complement of players. The orchestration in Salvation Army banding is almost identical to that of secular banding except for a minor difference in the cornet section whereby the repiano is dropped and the remainder of the row is made up of parts designated 1st and 2nd (two players each) rather than 2nd and 3rd; and that some major pieces have a split first trombone part, the lower part usually cued elsewhere in the band. Corps bands The corps (church) band, for example the Parramatta Citadel Band, is the basic unit of Salvation Army banding. These are the local bands, supporting worship services each Sunday and other special events as needed by the corps. Corps bands range in size from a quartet to 40 or more players. Primarily the bands play from the Salvation Army Tune Book, for some smaller bands the playing of these simple hymn tunes is their primary function, some usually smaller bands are limited to this, however many extend to more complex pieces such as marches. Elite bands of the Salvation Army are comparable to professional level secular competition bands, capable of playing almost anything. The primary function of a corps band is to support the Sunday worship services of the corps. Unlike a band which is primarily doing concerts, a corps band usually does not develop a standing repertoire. The typical corps band plays one or two pieces each Sunday morning, plus accompaniment for congregational singing. The corps bandmaster must have a ready list of items that can be played without rehearsal, in case key players are missing on a particular week. Corps bands also support a variety of other corps activities, either as a complete unit or in ensembles. Members of a corps band are usually soldiers of the corps. The corps officer, as the commander of the unit, functions as the executive officer. Except in the larger corps, there are generally holes in the instrumentation Regional bands Regional bands are usually sponsored by an area command or a divisional headquarters. Some regional bands are formed because there are no large corps bands in the area. The regional band, drawing on several corps, can complete the instrumentation and play more complex music. Some regional bands serve as elite groups, with the better players in an area in the group. The staff band can be thought of as the extreme case of a regional band. Many youth bands are regional in character. Regional bands are more concert-oriented than corps bands, although many regional bands serve as duty bands for large meetings and events. Many regional bands rehearse less frequently than once a week, especially those covering a large geographic area. Also, some regional bands operate on a seasonal basis, for example, not operating during the summer months. Most regional bands have a more formal structure than the typical corps band. Usually, a ranking officer from the sponsoring command serves as executive officer. There is usually an official band board. Board positions such as band sergeant, secretary, quartermaster, and librarian are often filled. Many regional groups have strict admission or audition standards. Membership in a corps band in the region is almost always required. Youth bands One of the major reasons why the Salvation Army has had a thriving brass band movement for over 100 years is the youth band and associated music education programs. Beginning at the corps level, many young Salvationists are taught to play and sing, starting sometimes as early as seven years of age. These are normally called young people's (\\"YP\\") bands. Some small regions, known in the Salvation Army as divisions, will have a Divisional Youth Band drawn from people aged 13‚Äì30 who live within the area covered by the division. One such example is Sydney Youth Band. Bigger areas are known in the Salvation Army as Territories: e.g. the United Kingdom with the Republic of Ireland territory hosts what is known as the Territorial Youth Band (TYB) for youth aged 12‚Äì18. Fellowship bands In recent years, the fellowship band has become an increasingly popular form of Salvation Army ensemble. These groups take a variety of forms, including bands made up mostly of players who have retired from other bands, which is one of the most common. One such group is Vintage Brass, sponsored by the Long Beach Citadel corps in California. Because most fellowship bands have a less formal structure and less demanding schedule than regular Salvation Army bands, they are sometimes seen as casual or lesser ensembles. However, many fellowship groups are excellent musically and rival some of the top standing ensembles in the quality of their performance. One example of this in the UK is the South London Fellowship Band, which meets for rehearsal on a fortnightly basis throughout the year and provides concerts and musical programmes on invitation from a variety of sources - Corps' in the South East of England and further afield, as well as Churches and charities. Staff bands The staff bands are the top level of Salvation Army banding. A staff band is sponsored by a territorial headquarters. The staff bands were originally made up of staff members from the headquarters. Although most staff bands still have many Salvation Army officer and employee members, non-staff players are more common in the modern staff band. The staff bands are among the most formal Salvation Army groups. Most have long histories, and travel and record on a regular basis. There are twelve staff bands that are generally recognized as major staff bands. The International Staff Band is considered to be the premier band of the Army: *Amsterdam (Netherlands) *Canadian (Canada and Bermuda) *Chicago (USA Central) *German (Germany) *Hong Kong (Hong Kong and Macau) *International (United Kingdom) *Japan (Japan) *Kinshasa (Democratic Republic of Congo - 2014) *Melbourne (Australia South) *New York (USA East) *Southern Territorial Band (USA South) *USA West (USA Western) Bandsmen/bandswomen Salvation Army musicians have some common characteristics - almost all Salvation Army bands have standards such as those listed below. *The musician must be a member, in good standing, of a corps. In most cases, the individual must be enrolled as a soldier. Youth bands usually require that members attend a corps regularly and be of the proper age. *Most bands have some standards of musicianship. For example, a corps band may require that anyone wishing to join the band be able to play selected tunes from the Band Tune Book. Larger bands such as regional groups often have audition and/or invitation policies. *Salvationist musicians are volunteers. No monetary compensation is given for service in a band. Even composers and arrangers whose work is published in the various Salvation Army music publications are not generally compensated except for nominal amounts. Some bands will have band reservists who are elderly players that have retired from the band. Reservists may play from time to time if needed. Band board A band board is a committee that oversees the operations of a band. Most corps bands do not have full, formal boards. The definitions below are generic; each band may have its own variation on the scope and composition of the band board. In larger bands some positions may hold secondary positions for example Deputy Bandmaster or Assistant Secretary. *Executive Officer All Salvation Army bands are sponsored by some level of the command structure. The executive officer is the official representative of the sponsoring organization. This person serves as the chairman of the band board. In some cases, the executive officer is not a player in the band. For a corps band, the corps officer is the de facto executive officer. * Bandmaster The bandmaster is the musical director and conductor of the band. This person has the primary responsibility for selecting music, developing performance programs, and setting the musical standards for the group. In a corps setting, the bandmaster is a senior local officer, with an automatic seat on the corps council. Regional and staff bandmasters are usually appointed by the commander of the sponsoring unit. * Deputy Bandmaster The Deputy Bandmaster is the second in command as far as leadership of the group is concerned. If the Bandmaster is away, for whatever reason, the Deputy Bandmaster assumes control of the group. This is also true of situations where the Bandmaster is playing with the group as a soloist, or if the group splits in two, as many larger bands do while on tour. This person is also responsible to help the Bandmaster in any of his own duties. In a corps setting, the Deputy Bandmaster is also a senior local officer, and is generally a member of the corps council. While not an essential position, many bands have a Deputy Bandmaster. * Secretary The duties of the band secretary include recording the minutes and decisions of the band board, communication between the board and the players, and logistical details for engagements. When a band travels, the secretary is responsible for making the transportation and accommodation arrangements. If dues are collected, the secretary handles them unless a treasurer is designated. The band secretary is usually a player. * Sergeant Salvation Army bands have a spiritual purpose. The band sergeant is the band's chaplain. The sergeant also handles discipline and attendance problems. The band sergeant is usually a player. * Quartermaster The quartermaster is responsible for the band's uniforms and equipment, including any instruments owned by the band. The quartermaster is usually a player. * Librarian The band librarian is responsible for the music library, and the distribution of parts to the appropriate players. The librarian is usually a player.

Located at 1850 North Hermitage Avenue in Chicago's Bucktown neighborhood, it is an example of the Polish Cathedral style of churches. Along with St. Stanislaus Kostka, St. Hyacinth Basilica, St. Hedwig, St. Wenceslaus, and Holy Trinity it is one of the monumental Polish churches visible from the Kennedy Expressway. From 1899 until 1990, the parish was administered by priests of the Congregation of the Resurrection. Since January 1991, it has been administered by the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross. The church regularly makes appearances in The Dresden Files series of books by Jim Butcher. Architecture Nave Like a number of other Polish churches in the so-called Polish Cathedral style such as St. Josaphat's Basilica in Milwaukee or Immaculate Heart of Mary in Pittsburgh, the architectural firm of Worthmann and Steinbach modeled the church's design on St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It has been acclaimed as one of the finest specimens of Roman Renaissance architecture in the United States. The imposing brick edifice with its twin bell towers and magnificent dome was constructed at a cost of $400,000‚Äîa testament to the zeal of Father Gordon and to the generosity of parishioners. In 1948, in preparation for the parish's Golden Jubilee, John A. Mallin decorated the interior of the church with ornate designs and paintings. The W. W. Kimball pipe organ was installed in 1923 at a cost of $23,750.\\"History of the Parish\\", St. Mary of the Angels Diamond Jubilee (1899‚Äì1974), p. 22, November 1974. Retrieved 27 November 2014. It contains four manuals and 57 ranks that include theater stops which make it a rarity in the Archdiocese of Chicago. The cost of overhauling the organ in 1962 amounted to $15,000. In 1973, extensive repairs were made on the exterior of the dome of St. Mary of the Angels Church and the Holy Name Society donated the blue \\"Guiding Light\\", which is visible in the cupola for a significant distance‚Äîespecially from the nearby Kennedy Expressway.Since 1987, the \\"Guiding Light\\" has been turned off due to budget cuts. History=Beginnings and the building of the parish plant= St. Mary of the Angels parish was organized in 1899 by Rev. Vincent Barzynski, CR, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka, Chicago's oldest Polish parish. The parish was founded to serve the large number of Poles who had settled in Bucktown, which was a part of Chicago's Polish Downtown. The archdiocese purchased two city blocks totaling 96 lots at the corner of Hermitage and Cortland (formerly Clybourn Place) for $60,000. One block was subdivided for residences while the other became the site of the parish. The first pastor, Rev. Francis Gordon CR laid the cornerstone of the first building at 1810 North Hermitage Avenue, now used as the school, on July 2, 1899. The three story brick building was designed in the Renaissance style by Henry J. Schlacks and completed at the cost of $65,000. The basement housed meeting rooms, a gymnasium, and an auditorium. The main floor contained twelve classrooms and convent quarters while the second floor held the sanctuary with living quarters for the priests in the attic. The Archbishop led the dedication ceremony and Mayor Carter Harrison Jr. was among the crowd of 20,000 witnesses. Rev. Francis Gordon C.R. (1860-1931) - Founder of St. Mary of the Angels Parish On February 15, 1900, four Sisters of the Congregation of the Resurrection opened St. Mary of the Angels School with an enrollment of 425 students. In 1905, the new building at 1849 North Hermitage became the home of the novitiate for the sisters order. In 1909, Fr. Gordon began planning a new church building at the corner of Hermitage and Cortland. Although work commenced on September 28, 1911, the cornerstone of the church was not laid until August 2, 1914. Due to the numerous delays caused by strikes, World War I, and the critical shortage of building materials, construction continued over a period of eight years and eight months. In the meantime, the present rectory at 1825 North Wood Street was completed in July 1912. Finally, Archbishop George Mundelein dedicated the new St. Mary of the Angels sanctuary May 30, 1920. In 1899, only one parish committee and three societies existed, by the 1920s, the parish had grown to encompass a parish committee, two building and loan associations, 28 confraternities, sodalities, fraternal societies, and clubs. According to the September 21, 1912 edition of The New World, the parish had \\"grown so rapidly that it is now one of the largest parishes in the Archdiocese\\" with a membership of approximately 1,200 families. In nearby Annunciation parish membership continued to decline as Irish families moved away from the neighborhood. Once a flourishing Irish parish, by 1916 Annunciation parish numbered only 150 families. In 1915, the novitiate of the Sisters of the Resurrection was transferred to Norwood Park and plans were made to open a Day Nursery for children in the building at 1849 North Hermitage Avenue. Beginning February 21, 1917, children of working mothers were cared for by the Sisters of the Resurrection. By 1925, the school had an enrollment of 1,099 students who were under the direction of 22 Sisters of the Resurrection. From 1918 to 1924, Father Gordon served as regional superior of the Resurrectionists in the United States. In recognition of his many accomplishments on behalf of Polish Catholics in Chicago, he was awarded a papal medal in 1924. Father Gordon continued to serve the people of St. Mary of the Angels until his death on February 13, 1931. When the Archdiocese of Chicago organized a branch of Archbishop Weber High School in September 1952 in quarters at Division Street and Haddon Avenue it named the new facility Gordon Technical High School in honor of the first pastor of the parish. (In the summer of 2014, the school was renamed DePaul College Prep and its campus was named the Father Gordon Campus.) Rev. Leonard Long, CR served as pastor March to October 1931 and was succeeded by Rev. Thaddeus Ligman, CR, who remained as pastor for one year. In 1932, Rev. Edward Brzezinski, CR began a long pastorate of 19-years at St. Mary of the Angels. Not only had he grown up in the parish, but he had served as an assistant for three years. Under Father Brzezinski's leadership, the $250,000 parish debt was liquidated. Over the years, additions, alterations, and improvements have been made to the parish campus. In the 1930s, the auditorium became known as the Polish Aragon, a reference to the popular Aragon Ballroom that still exists in the city's Uptown neighborhood. The auditorium became a popular meeting place for the young people of the neighborhood and they turned out by the hundreds to attend the weekly dances sponsored by the parish. Rev. John Grabowski, CR, succeeded Father Brzezinski as pastor in 1951. He directed the construction of the present convent building at 1800 North Hermitage Avenue. Completed at a cost of $450,000, Cardinal Samuel Stritch dedicated it August 16, 1953. In 1954, Rev. Chester Brzegowy, CR, became pastor and was succeeded in 1957 by Rev. Anthony Rybarczyk, CR. =Decline and renewal= At its founding, St. Mary of the Angels parish numbered about 300 families. During the peak years of the 1920s, more than 1,600 families belonged to the parish with nearly 1,200 children enrolled in the parish school. Construction of the Kennedy Expressway significantly impacted the parish. Many homes in the neighborhood were razed to make way for the highway, which cut through the heart of Chicago Polonia. When the segment of the expressway which extends from Lake Street to Foster Avenue opened to traffic November 5, 1960, the parish had lost a sizable number of families and school enrollment had declined by one-third. Rev. Joseph Polinski, CR, served as pastor from 1964 until 1967, followed by Rev. Stanley Majkut, CR. Rev. Edward Karlowicz, CR, became pastor March 13, 1974. He grew up in nearby St. Stanislaus Kostka parish, was ordained in 1948 and from 1954 to 1960, served as principal of Weber High School. The church was renovated in preparation for the diamond jubilee of the founding of St. Mary of the Angels parish. Auxiliary Bishop Alfred Leo Abramowicz presided at the special jubilee Mass October 13, 1974. The year of festivities concluded with a parish dinner on December 8, 1974 at the House of the White Eagle. Since formation of the parish, 20 young men have been ordained, nine of them as Resurrectionists. Of the 36 young women from the parish who entered religious orders, 27 joined the Sisters of the Congregation of the Resurrection. In 1975, a Parish Council was organized. With the approval and cooperation of Father Karlowicz, a Concerned Citizens Group-composed mainly of parishioners sponsored meetings and talks for the benefit and welfare of all in the neighborhood. In 1978, the Archdiocese announced that the territorial parish of Annunciation would be consolidated. Spanish speaking families who had belonged to the parish were invited to join St. Mary of the Angels Church, St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, St. Hedwig Church, or St. Aloysius Church-all of which had Spanish speaking parishioners. Following the last Mass in Annunciation Church on June 25, 1978, the parish records were transferred to St. Mary of the Angels and later to the Archdiocese of Chicago Offices. Father Karlowicz was transferred out of St. Mary's in the spring of 1984. He served as associate pastor at St Hyacinth's & St. John Cantius before passing away on September 5, 2002 at the age of 80.\\"Obituary: Rev. Edwin Karlowicz C.R.\\", Chicago Tribune, 07 September 2002. Retrieved 28 November 2014. The church was closed and slated for demolition in 1988 due to unsafe conditions. Citizens and historians rallied to save the historic structure but feared the cause was already lost. Three years later in 1991, Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, then Archbishop of Chicago, entrusted the administration of the parish and school to the priests of Opus Dei. The Rev. John Twist, the first Pastor under this new administration, and his successor the Rev. Hilary Mahaney helped the parish grow once again. They launched several restoration campaigns leading to various private donations which helped bring the church structure to life once again with major repairs of the dome, the roofs and the stained-glass windows. Repairs continued in 1997 with the church interior. By the 100th anniversary of the parish in 1999, the church's interior decoration had been fully restored, new lighting, doors and a new sound system were installed. The 26 roof angels, fully rebuilt, were restored and continue to gleam cheerfully from Saint Mary's roof tops. In 2002, the parish constructed a chapel dedicated to St. Josemar√≠a Escriv√° de Balaguer, the Founder of Opus Dei, in the newly remodeled lower level. In April 2014, Francis Cardinal George appointed Rev. John R. Waiss as Pastor effective May 1, 2014 with the retirement of Rev. Hilary Mahaney. Mahaney remains as Pastor Emeritus. St. Mary of the Angels today Located in the heart of Bucktown and open from dawn to dusk, seven days a week, Sunday Masses are celebrated in English, Polish and Spanish. Every week, hundreds of area residents come to worship, attend classes and events. The priests of Opus Dei continue to oversee the parish. The area around the church is often referred to as 'Marianowo' by Poles. In recent years, the ethnic character of St. Mary of the Angels parish has undergone a gradual change from an exclusively Polish parish to one that is multicultural and multiracial, as the neighborhood first witnessed an influx of Hispanic immigrants in the early 1970s and then urban professionals in the 1990s as the area began to gentrify. =Mass Schedule= Sundays - English: 8:00 a.m.; 10:00 a.m.; 7:15 p.m. Spanish: 12:00 p.m. Saturdays - English: 8:00 a.m.*; 5:00 p.m. (Mass of Anticipation); Polish: 6:30 p.m. (Mass of Anticipation) Weekdays - English: 7:00 a.m.*; 5:30 p.m.* (*in St. Josemar√≠a Chapel located in lower level) Chronology of Pastors Who Served at St. Mary of the Angels * Rev.

Torchitorio IIIAlso spelled Torgodorio, Dorgodorio, Torcotore, or Torxitori. The rulers of Cagliari had the habit of alternating their regnal names between Salusio and Torchitorio. (died after 1188), born Peter, was the Judge of Cagliari from October 1163 to his deposition and arrest in 1188, after which he was never heard of again. Peter was a younger son of Gonario II of Logudoro. In 1147, he received the curatoria of Ottana. He married the eldest daughter of Constantine II of Cagliari, whose name is unknown, sometime before 1163. Following Constantine's death without surviving sons in October 1163, Peter \\"inherited\\" the giudicato jure uxoris. In fact, he was proclaimed with strong Pisan support. However, Barisone II of Arborea, as a direct descendant of Constantine II laid claim to Cagliari. He invaded the giudicato and forced Peter to flee to the court of his elder brother Barisone II of Logudoro at Porto Torres. In March 1164, the Barisone and Peter, united with the Pisans of the island, retook the city of Cagliari and then invaded Arborea in April. The judge of Arborea took refuge in the castle of Cabras. In 1166, Peter and his brother travelled to Pisa to try to explain the bloody reprisals of their citizens against the Pisans in Ottana. Returning to Sardinia, the two made a pact with the Republic of Genoa, ally of the Arboreans. In 1168, a treaty was negotiated by the Genoese diplomat Nuvolone Alberici between Genoa and Arborea on one side and Pisa, Logudoro, and Cagliari on the other. It patched up the differences which had led to the last war and restored some lost land to Arborea. In 1180, Barisone of Arborea made war on Cagliari. He had initial successes, but was captured and forced to come to terms. In 1183, Pisa reoccupied Cagliari. By 1186, Barisone of Logudoro had gone back over to the Pisan side, while Peter remained with Genoa. He tried to expel the Pisans from Cagliari and he made war on Peter I of Arborea. In 1187, open conflict raged over the whole island of Sardinia between the Genoese and their factions and the Pisans and theirs. The Pisans mercilessly assaulted Genoese merchants in Cagliari and despoiled their landed possessions, evicting them from the giudicato. They encouraged Obert, Margrave of Massa, and his son, William, to invade Cagliari and establish Pisan authority. Obert was the husband and William the son of Giorgia, the younger sister of Peter's wife. On this basis, William laid claim to the giudicato. In 1188, he captured Peter and imprisoned him. He probably took control of the giudicato, though the next few years are extremely obscure. Peter never resurfaced and probably died in prison or was killed. Peter had two daughters. One died in infancy. The other married Eldizio Visconti and became the mother of Lamberto and Ubaldo I Visconti. NotesSources *Caravale, Mario (ed).

It was designed to enable a machine gun (in practice, a Lewis Gun) to fire over, rather than through the arc of the spinning propeller. It took several forms when applied to different aircraft types, but all shared the feature of a quadrant shaped I-beam rail on which the gun could slide back and down in one movement. The primary purpose was to facilitate the changing of spent ammunition drums, but some pilots also found that the mounting permitted the gun to be fired directly upward or at an angle, permitting a fighter aircraft to attack an opponent from beneath. Background Before the ready availability of a reliable synchronization gear, several methods were tried to mount a machine gun in a position from which it would be able to fire past rather than through the arc of the propeller.Cheesman 1960, p. 176. Even after reasonably reliable synchronization was available for closed bolt weapons such as the Vickers gun there were reasons for avoiding synchronization. Even the best synchronization gears were liable to failure, and there were special hazards in firing incendiary and explosive ammunition through the propeller arc. Some weapons, such as the Lewis gun, were not easy to synchronize at all. An alternative was to fire over the propeller, especially in the case of a biplane aircraft, where the structure of the upper wing formed a convenient base. A drawback was that such a mount was less robust than a mounting on the forward fuselage, and the accuracy of the gun, especially at long range, was affected by vibration. The main difficulty, however, was the need for the pilot or gunner to have access to the breech of the gun, to change drums or belts as well as to clear jams. One of several arrangements used to mount an \\"over-wing\\" Lewis gun on a Nieuport fighter in French service The earliest mountings for a Lewis gun on the top wing of a light scout aircraft were fixed, and either the inaccessibility of the breech was accepted, or drums were changed by the pilot standing up (in some cases having to stand on his seat) to reach the gun.Cheesman 1960, p. 48. A hinged arrangement, permitting the breech to be swung back and down into a position where the pilot could change drums while in his seat was preferable, and several versions of such mountings enabled the Lewis (or Hotchkiss) guns of the French Nieuport 11 fighters to tackle the German Fokker Eindeckers in early 1916. Typically, two hinges were fitted to a pillar type support for the breech of the gun. With the gun hinged back, the empty drum could be removed by being pulled back, rather than having to be lifted off the gun, while the second hinge brought the Lewis gun breech down into the cockpit. Various arrangements of metal springs or bungee cord assisted the pilot to return the gun to its firing position.Woodman 1989, p. 79. Wing mounted Lewis guns were a stop-gap in French squadrons, to be replaced as soon as possible with synchronised Vickers guns. British airmen, on the other hand, had various reasons for retaining the wing-mounted Lewis guns of their Nieuports. On Nieuport fighters \\"Billy\\" Bishop demonstrates use of Foster Mounting to fire upwards. The \\"quadrant\\" of the mounting is visible immediately below the gun barrel. In early 1916 Sergeant Foster of 11 Squadron RFC improved the French hinged mounting for the upper wing Lewis gun on a Nieuport 11 or 16, by replacing the awkward double hinge of the French mount with a quadrant shaped I-beam rail. This rail became the feature of all later \\"Foster\\" mountings, and enabled the breech of the gun to slide back and down in one movement, bringing the breech conveniently in front of the pilot, and making it much easier to change ammunition drums or to clear stoppages.Bowyer 1977, p. 69. The mounting also permitted the Lewis gun to be fired obliquely forwards and upwards, to attack an enemy aircraft from behind and below: a favourite tactic of several \\"ace\\" pilots, including Albert Ball. The Schr√§ge Musik fitting used by German night fighter pilots in the Second World War used the same basic principle.Bowyer 1977, p. 76. When fired forwards, the trigger of the Lewis gun was controlled by a Bowden cable (see illustration at the top of the article); when fired upwards, the pistol grip was held to steady the weapon and it was fired with the trigger (as illustrated here). Diagram of the \\"Nieuport\\" version of the Foster Mounting from a contemporary maintenance manual Some pilots complained of quadrants twisting or breaking when subject to the forceful and clumsy handling inevitable in aerial combat, and some used elastic cord to replace or supplement the original clock-type spring fitted to assist returning the gun to its forward firing position. In general, however, the mounting was highly successful: and for the RFC Nieuport squadrons at least much to be preferred to the unreliable early mechanical synchronisation gears. It remained in use by the British in the later Nieuport 17 and Nieuport 24, although some strengthening of the quadrant is evident in photographs. On the S.E.5 Albert Ball demonstrates the Foster mount in an early S.E.5 with original windscreen and seating position. Due to the different disposition of the wings and fuselage, adaptation of the mounting to the S.E.5a was not straightforward. The \\"S.E.5\\" version of the mount required a much longer and more robust quadrant rail. When the S.E. was fitted with a geared engine, raising the thrustline and the top of the propeller arc, it was necessary to raise the mounting by the same amount, to ensure the line of fire cleared the propeller.Hare 2013, p. 61. While Albert Ball continued to use the upward firing technique for some of his last victories, other pilots remarked on the great skill and marksmanship needed to achieve success with this manoeuvre in an S.E.5.Bowyer 1977, pp. 109-110. Several pilots remarked on the gymnastics required to change drums in a hurry, especially in the middle of a dogfight.McCudden, 1918, p. 168. Diagram of the \\"S.E.5\\" version of the Foster mounting from a contemporary maintenance manual Rather than being fitted instead of a synchronised weapon, the Foster-mounted Lewis in the S.E.5 was fitted in addition. The two guns were normally used together, both being aimed through an Aldis sight, implying a degree of harmonization; but in some respects this arrangement was less than ideal. Replacement of the\\"hybrid\\" S.E.5 armament with twin guns (either two Vickers or two Foster mounted Lewis guns) was considered, but it was calculated that the centre section of the upper wing would have required reinforcement to cope with the recoil and vibration of two Lewis guns firing simultaneously.Hare 2013, p. 69. Twin-gun versions of the hydraulic C.C. synchronisation gear were not available until late 1917, and the early examples were required to replace the inferior Sopwith-Kauper gears used in early Camels, so that the armament of the S.E.5a remained the same throughout its production life.King 1980, p. 155. On S.E.5s that were used by advanced training units in 1918 the Foster mounting proved amenable for the Hythe camera gun, one of the first of its kind. Reflections from the spinning propeller that may have interfered with pictures taken by a cowl mounted \\"gun\\" were avoided.Hare 2013, pp. 88-89. Twin Foster mountings on a specially modified Sopwith Camel (\\"Sopwith Comic\\"). On the Sopwith Camel The 2F.1 (the shipboard variant of the Camel), carried an over-wing Lewis gun, mainly as an anti-airship weapon. As the adaptation of either type of Foster mounting to a normal Camel was not feasible, a special mounting, officially termed the \\"Admiralty upper-plane mounting\\", became standard for the 2F.1.Bruce 1968, p. 157. To eliminate the muzzle-flash from cowling mounted guns that could blind a pilot at night, some of the F.1 Camels used as night fighters were modified to take Foster mountings. The positions of the pilot's seat and the main fuel tank were swapped, moving the pilot well aft of the upper wing. Twin Foster mountings were fitted, and the quadrant rails were either attached to a special \\"goal post\\" bracket, or braced by a simple cross brace between them.Cheesman 1960, p. 183. The starboard Lewis gun in our illustration has been demounted from its rail and fixed to fire upwards without having to be held and fired by hand, although it can not be raised to fire forward from this position. Other types and experimental fittings The unofficial \\"Sopwith Comic\\" name was also applied to a field modified Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter used by some home defence squadrons. The cockpit was moved back behind the wings, and one or two Lewis guns, either mounted on Foster mountings or fixed to fire upwards, outside the arc of the propeller, replaced the synchronised Vickers. Attempt to adapt a Foster mounting to a Bristol F.2b Fighter The night fighter version of the Avro 504K was also armed with a \\"modified S.E 5a\\" type Foster mounted Lewis gun (see illustration at the head of this article). This aircraft had a much larger gap between the top of the fuselage and the upper wing than most types fitted with this mounting and must have proved very awkward to use. On the B.E.12b, intended as a night fighter, over-wing Lewis guns relied on makeshift mountings, including one that resembled the original double hinged mounting on early French Nieuports. Attempts to add one or two Foster mounted Lewis guns to the Bristol Fighter were not successful. Among other problems, the mounting caused interference with the pilot's compass, which was mounted on the trailing edge of the upper wing, a difficulty which persisted even when the mounting was offset to starboard.Bruce 1988, pp. 43‚Äì45.

Originally part of the Town of Jasper Place, West Jasper Place became a part of Edmonton when Edmonton and Jasper Place amalgamated on August 17, 1964. While most of the neighbourhood is residential, there is some commercial development, with most of this adjacent to Stony Plain Road at the neighbourhood's north end. This development includes the Jasper Gates shopping centre. Note that, during the 1980s and 1990s, Edmonton Transit System buses travelling out to locations west of 170 Street showed a destination of West Jasper Place. This meant a bus route with a destination west of the old Jasper Place townsite, rather than a bus route with the neighbourhood of West Jasper Place as the destination. Bus routes terminating in the old townsite area usually showed a destination of Jasper Place. The neighbourhood is bounded by 149 Street on the east, 95 Avenue on the south, 156 Street on the west, and Stony Plain Road on the North. The community is represented by the West Jasper/Sherwood Community League. Which maintains a community hall, outdoor rink and tennis courts located at 152 Street and 96 Avenue. The West Jasper Place Community League operated as a separate entity from 1950 until 1985 when it merged with the Sherwood Community League.  Demographics  In the City of Edmonton's 2012 municipal census, West Jasper Place had a population of living in dwellings, a -2.9% change from its 2009 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of people/km2 in 2012. According to the 2005 municipal census, one in five (17.9%) of the population moved into the neighbourhood within the previous 12 months. Another one in four (23.9%) had moved within the previous one to three years. Only two out of every five (42.7%) had lived at the same address for five years or more. This is similar to the city at large. Just over half (51%) were male and just under half (49%) were female.  Residential development  According to the 2001 federal census, just under one third (29.4%) of the residential dwellings in the neighbourhood were built prior to the 1964 amalgamation of Jasper Place and Edmonton, with a significant number of those being built prior to the 1945 end of World War II. Approximately half (48.2%) of the residences were built between 1960 and 1980. The remaining 22.4% were built after 1980, with a particular spike in residential construction occurring in a short span during the early 1990s, when one in ten (11.7%) of residences were constructed.http://censusdocs.edmonton.ca/DD23/FEDERAL%202001/Neighbourhood/WEST%20JASPER%20PLACE.pdf In 2005, three out of every five residences (59.3%) were rented apartments, including a small number of apartment style condominiums. Most of these are in low rise buildings with fewer than five stories. Another third of the residences (35.5%) were single detached houses. A small number (5%) were duplexes. Approximately two out of every three (68%) of all residences are rented.  Schools  There is a single school at the southern edge of the neighbourhood, Sherwood Elementary School, operated by the Edmonton Public School System.

Fa√ßade engineering is the art and science of resolving aesthetic, environmental and structural issues to achieve the effective enclosure of buildings. Specialist companies are dedicated to this niche sector of the building industry and engineers operate within technical divisions of fa√ßade manufacturing companies. Generally, fa√ßade engineers are specifically qualified in the discipline of fa√ßade engineering and consultants work with the design team on construction projects for architects, building owners, construction managers and product manufacturers. Fa√ßade engineers must consider aspects such as the design, certification, fabrication and installation of the building fa√ßades with regards to the performance of materials, aesthetic appearance, structural behaviour, weathertightness, safety and serviceability, security, maintenance and build ability. The skill set will include matters such as computational fluid dynamics, heat transfer through two- and three-dimensional constructions, the behaviour of materials, manufacturing methodologies, structural engineering and logistics. Over time, the specialist skills necessary in this niche sector have surpassed the capabilities of architects, structural and mechanical engineers as buildings are designed with more complexity and with the introduction of Building Information Modelling (BIM). Building fa√ßades are considered to be one of the most expensive and potentially the highest risk element of any major project. Historically building facades have the greatest level of failure of any part of a building fabric and the pressure for change and adaptation due to environmental and energy performance needs is greater than any other element of a building. As a consequence fa√ßade engineering has become a science in its own right. In the United Kingdom, a professional body associated with the industry is the Society of Fa√ßade Engineering. Qualifications in fa√ßade engineering recognised by the Society of Fa√ßade Engineering and international professional qualifications include the MSc in fa√ßade engineering.

It was built on the east bank of the Mississippi River in today's Nicollet Island/East Bank neighborhood; it is the oldest continuously used church building in the city and is part of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District. History The First Universalist Church in 1857 The oldest church building in Minneapolis, Our Lady of Lourdes has been in continuous use since the mid-19th century. The First Universalist Society of St. Anthony erected the building in Greek Revival style as a meeting hall between 1854 and 1857 as the First Universalist Church where they worshipped until 1877. A congregation of Catholic French Canadians acquired the church in 1877 and named it in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary who Catholics believed had recently appeared to Bernadette Soubirous in France as Our Lady of Lourdes. One of many churches throughout the world named for the appearances in Lourdes, Our Lady of Lourdes in Minneapolis was the first in the U.S. with this name. The Catholic parish made significant additions to the building between 1880‚Äì83, adding a transept, apse and front bell tower with three steeples; a front vestibule was added in 1914. Near the birthplace of Minneapolis, the church stands near the Pillsbury \\"A\\" Mill and the only natural waterfall on the Mississippi River. The building is not listed as a National Historic Landmark but it is the subject of Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) drawings and photographs created in 1934. The parish school spoke French until about 1917 when the congregation dwindled and by 1945 the priests gave sermons only in English. The church survived extinction when the Minneapolis City Council persuaded bishops of the diocese to stop plans to close and board it up in 1968. Our Lady of Lourdes is now one of 85 contributing properties of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District which is on the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture The architecture is an unusual combination of architectural styles. The Universalists constructed the original building of limestone quarried at nearby Nicollet Island in Greek Revival style based on a Greek temple (shown below at left). Their design was and built at a cost of $15,000. In the 1880s, the Catholic congregation added a V-frame beam truss, the steeple, the transept, bell tower, sacristy and vestibule in French Provincial and Gothic Revival style. The design for the circular nave comes from the Chapel Royale at Versailles. Today The church teaches Catholic beliefs, the morality and model for conduct taught by Jesus, the sacraments and prayer. Members believe in caring for the ill and those who are physically unable to attend services. The parish offers classes called faith formation for all ages.Faith Formation , and To support the continuing restoration of their church, the congregation produces and sells French Canadian tourti√®res, a savory meat pie.Information , and Parishioners have protected the stained glass, building exterior, and the Blessed Virgin's grotto above the front entrance, and have restored the interior, renovated the rectory and added carillon bells. Guided tours are offered by appointment. The address was at one time Prince Street and is now called Lourdes Place.

He trained with Santi di Tito in Florence, and painted in Rome under Clement VIII, including a Crucifixion for Santa Prassede and a Saint Giovanni Gualberto in its sacristy; Angels on the walls above the choirstalls in the apse of Santa Maria in Trastevere; frescoes of the Stoning of Saint Vitale in San Vitale and further frescoes in the little church of Santa Bibiena; and The Visitation in Sant Stefano di Pescia. At the Basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano, Ciampelli frescoed the walls of the canons' sacristy, the \\"Sala Clementina\\". Life=Florence and Rome= Agostino Ciampelli was born in Florence. There is little known about his early childhood. Agostino trained in the studio of Santi di Tito, a leading artists of the Counter Reformation. Agostino was admitted into the Accademia del Disegno in Florence in 1585. Some of his earliest known works include paintings for a temporary triumphal arch at the entry of Christina of Lorraine into Florence in 1589. These paintings were constructed by Santi and his pupils. In Florence, Agostino he frescoed a Story of Esther and Ahasuerus in the Tornabuoni Chapel. Agostino also worked with Andrea Commodi at the Gesu, painting scenes from the life of Ignatius that would later adorn Commodi‚Äôs tomb in 1605. Agostino traveled to Rome during the papacy of Clement VIII. There Agostino painted Crucifixion for Santa Prassede, angels on the walls of the apse of Santa Maria in Trastevere and a Visitation in Santo Stefano di Pescia. He also painted a Nativity of the Virgin in San Michelino Visdomini in Florence, and a fresco cycle of Old Testament themes for the Palazzo Corsini. He also painted the Chapel of St. Andrew in the Church of the Gesu in Rome, representing The Martydom of St Stephen on the walls; on the vault The Glory of the Virgin Surrounded by Holy Martyrs; and for the altarpiece, The Martyrdom of St Andrew. Influences Santi di Tito was a major influence to Agostino, impacting his style and assisting him in acquiring his skills. Another major role in Agostino‚Äôs life was Alessandro de Medici. Alessandro was the most important patron and protector to Agostino. Alessandro took Agostino to Rome in 1594 after Agostino went through schooling from 1590 to 1594 at Florentine Academy in Florence where he stayed until 1630. Many works were produced with Alessandro and can be found in his titular church of Santa Prassede and at Sant'Agnese fuori le mura in Trastevere. Paintings Agostino produced many pieces of artwork in Italy. Two of his paintings that he is well known for are Two Angels Facing Right and Two Angels Facing Left. These bright, vivid panels of angels were done with oil pastels and done around 1600. These paintings formed a now-lost painting or altarpiece. The elegance of these paintings shows the continuing influence of Santi di Tito and may be compared with such paintings as a Christ Appearing to Saint Martin of Tours in the church of Santa Maria del Pianto in Rome, which was one of the few commissions awarded to Ciampelli by Pope Leo XI. Similar angels appear in a number of Ciampello‚Äôs paintings, such as The Death of Saint Anthony Abbot which was created in 1612 displayed in the church of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini in Rome. The facial types of the angels may also be compared with the figures of The Baptism of Christ done by Ciampelli, which was formally in the Palazzo Corsini in Florence. Other paintings produced by Agostino are the Madonna of the Rosary and the Annunciation done in oil pastels and both executed around 1600. Other works Ciampelli was also known for using other mediums in his artwork. A very well known drawing of his is The Stoning of St. Stephen which was produced with pen and ink with chalk and was executed when Ciampelli was in Florence around the 1580s. This drawing is a great example of how Ciampelli‚Äôs artwork was simple and direct religious art. Ciampelli also constructed lunettes, one of them being a decoration for a chapel. The lunette consists of angels making music and carrying the symbols of the Immaculate Conception along with angels on the side. The medium used to create this was pen, ink, and wash with chalk and was created in Rome around 1615.

In a more general sense, empirical probability estimates probabilities from experience and observation. Given an event A in a sample space, the relative frequency of A is the ratio m/n, m being the number of outcomes in which the event A occurs, and n being the total number of outcomes of the experiment. In statistical terms, the empirical probability is an estimate or estimator of a probability. In simple cases, where the result of a trial only determines whether or not the specified event has occurred, modelling using a binomial distribution might be appropriate and then the empirical estimate is the maximum likelihood estimate. It is the Bayesian estimate for the same case if certain assumptions are made for the prior distribution of the probability. If a trial yields more information, the empirical probability can be improved on by adopting further assumptions in the form of a statistical model: if such a model is fitted, it can be used to derive an estimate of the probability of the specified event Advantages and disadvantages=Advantages= An advantage of estimating probabilities using empirical probabilities is that this procedure is relatively free of assumptions. For example, consider estimating the probability among a population of men that they satisfy two conditions: # that they are over 6 feet in height. # that they prefer strawberry jam to raspberry jam. A direct estimate could be found by counting the number of men who satisfy both conditions to give the empirical probability of the combined condition. An alternative estimate could be found by multiplying the proportion of men who are over 6 feet in height with the proportion of men who prefer strawberry jam to raspberry jam, but this estimate relies on the assumption that the two conditions are statistically independent. =Disadvantages= A disadvantage in using empirical probabilities arises in estimating probabilities which are either very close to zero, or very close to one. In these cases very large sample sizes would be needed in order to estimate such probabilities to a good standard of relative accuracy. Here statistical models can help, depending on the context, and in general one can hope that such models would provide improvements in accuracy compared to empirical probabilities, provided that the assumptions involved actually do hold. For example, consider estimating the probability that the lowest of the daily-maximum temperatures at a site in February in any one year is less than zero degrees Celsius. A record of such temperatures in past years could be used to estimate this probability. A model-based alternative would be to select a family of probability distributions and fit it to the dataset containing past years‚Ä≤ values. The fitted distribution would provide an alternative estimate of the desired probability. This alternative method can provide an estimate of the probability even if all values in the record are greater than zero. Mixed nomenclature The phrase a-posteriori probability is also used as an alternative to empirical probability or relative frequency. The use of the phrase \\"a-posteriori\\" is reminiscent of terms in Bayesian statistics, but is not directly related to Bayesian inference, where a-posteriori probability is occasionally used to refer to posterior probability, which is different even though it has a confusingly similar name. The term a-posteriori probability, in its meaning as equivalent to empirical probability, may be used in conjunction with a priori probability which represents an estimate of a probability not based on any observations, but based on deductive reasoning.

In Hinduism Dhvaja ('victory banner'), on the roof of Jokhang Monastery. Dhvaja in Hindu or vedic tradition takes on the appearance of a high column (dhvaja-stambha) erected in front of temples. Dhvaja, meaning a flag banner, was a military standard of ancient Indian warfare. Notable flags, belonging to the Gods, are as follows: *Garuda Dhwaja ‚Äì The flag of Vishnu. *Indra Dhwaja ‚Äì The flag of Indra. Also a festival of Indra. *Kakkai kodi ‚Äì The flag of Jyestha, goddess of inauspicious things and misfortune. *Kapi Dhwaja or Vanara dwaja (Vanara = Vana + Nara, Flag of the Man of the forest) ‚Äì The flag of Arjuna in the Mahabharata, in which the Lord Hanuman himself resided.Sri Ramakrishna Math (1985) \\"Hanuman Chalisa\\" p. 9 *Makaradhvaja ‚Äì The flag of Kama, god of love. *Seval Kodi ‚Äì The war flag of Lord Murugan, god of war.

Within the Tibetan tradition a list of eleven different forms of the victory banner is given to represent eleven specific methods for overcoming \\"defilements\\" (Sanskrit: klesha). Many variations of the dhvaja's design can be seen on the roofs of Tibetan monasteries (Gompa, Vihara) to symbolyze the Buddha's victory over four maras. In its most traditional form the victory banner is fashioned as a cylindrical ensign mounted upon a long wooden axel-pole. The top of the banner takes the form of a small white \\"parasol\\" (Sanskrit: chhatra), which is surrounded by a central \\"wish granting gem\\" (Sanskrit: cintamani). This domed parasol is rimmed by an ornate golden crest-bar or moon-crest with makara-trailed ends, from which hangs a billowing yellow or \\"white silk scarf'\\"(Sanskrit: khata) (see top right). As a hand-held ensign the victory banner is an attribute of many deities, particularly those associated with wealth and power, such as Vai≈õrava·πáa, the Great Guardian King of the north. As roof-mounted ensign the victory banners are cylinders usually made of beaten copper (similar to toreutics) and are traditionally placed on the four corners of monastery and temple roofs. Those roof ornaments usually take the form of a small circular parasol surmounted by the wish-fulfilling gem, with four or eight makara heads at the parasol edge, supporting little silver bells (see the Jokhang Dhvaja on the left). A smaller victory banner fashioned on a beaten copper frame, hung with black silk, and surmounted by a flaming \\"trident\\" (Sanskrit: trishula) is also commonly displayed on roofs (see the dhvaja on the roof of the Potala Palace below).A Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols by Robert Beer, Shambhala, 2003, p.13The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs by Robert Beer, Shambhala, 1999, p.180 File:Five Dhvajas, Potala White Palace.jpgFive Dhvajas (Victory banners), on the roof of the Potala White Palace.

He travelled to Rome in the mid-1640s and came into contact with the French and Flemish artists living there. This international melting pot gave rise to an original artistic vocabulary aimed at the naturalistic depiction of reality in a vast number of still lifes, landscapes and portraits.

It was disbanded by being redesignated as a Group of Forces in the early 1990s after the Soviet Union collapse. The military district formed as a basis of the modern day armed forces of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.  History  It was originally formed from the Red Army's Separate Caucasian Army, which became the Red Banner Caucasian Army in August 1923. On 17 May 1935 the Red Banner Caucasus Army was redesignated the Transcaucasian Military District. The Georgian, Armenian, and Azerbaijani national formations, plus units from the 11th Soviet Red Army, all joined the new district about this time. In July 1936 the District's formations and units received designations according to the countrywide numbering scheme and became: the 9th (formerly 1st Caucasus) Mountain Rifle Division, named for the Central Executive Committee of the Georgian SSR; the 20th (formerly 3rd Caucasus) Mountain Rifle Division; the 47th (former 1st) Georgian Mountain Rifle Division, named for Joseph Stalin; the 63rd (former 2nd) Georgian Mountain Rifle Division, named for Mikhail Frunze; the 76th Armenian Mountain Rifle Division, named after Comrade Voroshilov, and the 77th –êzerbaijani Mountain Rifle Division, named for Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze.A.G.

The 44th Army was formed from the 40th Rifle Corps and the 47th Army formed from the 27th Mechanized Corps. Both armies were deployed on the Iranian border. On 23 August, the military district became the Transcaucasus Front. District headquarters was subordinated to the front's military council and directed the formation of new units. It was disbanded on 14 September 1941. On 28 January 1942, the military district was reformed when the Caucasian Front was divided into the Transcaucasian Military District and the Crimean Front. The district was commanded by Ivan Tyulenev and included the 45th and 46th Armies, as well as 4 rifle divisions and a rifle brigade. On 28 April 1942, the district became the second formation of the Transcaucasian Front. On 9 July 1945, the Tbilisi and Baku Military Districts were formed from the Transcaucasian Front. Tbilisi Military District Headquarters was in Tbilisi and was formed from the Transcaucasian Front headquarters. The district controlled forces in the Georgian and Armenian SSRs. The district was commanded by Colonel General Sergei Trofimenko, former 27th Army commander. The headquarters of the Baku Military District was formed from 69th Army headquarters and was located in Baku. The district controlled forces in the Azerbaijan SSR and Dagestan ASSR. It was commanded by Colonel general Vladimir Kolpakchi, former 69th Army commander. In October 1945, Army General Ivan Maslennikov took command. On 15 November 1945, control of forces in the Nakhichevan ASSR was transferred from the Tbilisi Military District to the Baku Military District.

A single round would hold two links together, and more could be added to make up a belt of any quantity of rounds, though for the mounted machine guns of the time, a belt of 250 rounds was most commonly used. As was the trend with American belt-fed firearms, as opposed to Soviet designs, belts of ammunition feed into the gun from the left side to the right. The left side of a single link had a circular loop which would hold the main body of the cartridge case, and an extension on the right that formed two similar loops which was designed to fit in between the two right-side loops of the next link. The rear loop of the right side of the link would hold onto the cartridge case just below the shoulder, as would the left side loop, where the front loop of the left side of the link held onto the cartridge neck, and was therefore a bit smaller in diameter. This was designed so that the M1919 machine gun's extractor claw would take hold of the rim of the cartridge and pull it out of the linked belt from the rear, where it would then be fed into the chamber and would rest there until fired. The feeding pawl in the gun would pull the belt to the right as the gun was fired or cocked, sending the loose link out to the right side of the receiver, where the expended case was dropped vertically below the gun. This disintegrating system is a contrast to older canvas belts and other non-disintegrating metal link belts, although disintegrating-link types are almost universal in the present day, as the lower cost and lack of a loose, empty belt end to deal with are very attractive to the military. M1 links were used during World War I, World War II, and the Korean War but were replaced in frontline service by the NATO M13 link developed for the M60 machine gun.

The Fourier transform of triple correlation is the bispectrum. The triple correlation extends the concept of autocorrelation, which correlates a function with a single shifted copy of itself and thereby enhances its latent periodicities.  History  The theory of the triple correlation was first investigated by statisticians examining the cumulant structure of non-Gaussian random processes. It was also independently studied by physicists as a tool for spectroscopy of laser beams. Hideya Gamo in 1963 described an apparatus for measuring the triple correlation of a laser beam, and also showed how phase information can be recovered from the real part of the bispectrum‚Äîup to sign reversal and linear offset. However, Gamo's method implicitly requires the Fourier transform to never be zero at any frequency. This requirement was relaxed, and the class of functions which are known to be uniquely identified by their triple (and higher-order) correlations was considerably expanded, by the study of Yellott and Iverson (1992). Yellott & Iverson also pointed out the connection between triple correlations and the visual texture discrimination theory proposed by Bela Julesz.  Applications  Triple correlation methods are frequently used in signal processing for treating signals that are corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise; in particular, triple correlation techniques are suitable when multiple observations of the signal are available and the signal may be translating in between the observations, e.g.,a sequence of images of an object translating on a noisy background. What makes the triple correlation particularly useful for such tasks are three properties: (1) it is invariant under translation of the underlying signal; (2) it is unbiased in additive Gaussian noise; and (3) it retains nearly all of the relevant phase information in the underlying signal. Properties (1)-(3) of the triple correlation extend in many cases to functions on an arbitrary locally compact group, in particular to the groups of rotations and rigid motions of euclidean space that arise in computer vision and signal processing.  Extension to groups  The triple correlation may be defined for any locally compact group by using the group's left-invariant Haar measure. It is easily shown that the resulting object is invariant under left translation of the underlying function and unbiased in additive Gaussian noise. What is more interesting is the question of uniqueness : when two functions have the same triple correlation, how are the functions related? For many cases of practical interest, the triple correlation of a function on an abstract group uniquely identifies that function up to a single unknown group action. This uniqueness is a mathematical result that relies on the Pontryagin duality theorem, the Tannaka‚ÄìKrein duality theorem, and related results of Iwahori-Sugiura, and Tatsuuma. Algorithms exist for recovering bandlimited functions from their triple correlation on euclidean space, as well as rotation groups in two and three dimensions. There is also an interesting link with Wiener's tauberian theorem: any function whose translates are dense in L_1(G), where G is a locally compact abelian group, is also uniquely identified by its triple correlation.

Salon Selectives was the first salon-inspired mass market hair care brand, introduced by Helene Curtis in 1987. It was acquired by Unilever in 1996 and was revamped in 2000 with all-new products bearing catchy names (like Perfectly Normal shampoo and Hold Tight Hair spray). In 2011 the line was relaunched again with 32 oz bottles designed to give consumers salon grade product at everyday value pricing. Salon Selectives Family of Products Original level-based lineup (1987-2000) When originally introduced in 1987, Salon Selectives was conceived as a level-based product line of shampoos, conditioners, and styling products. SS shampoos had rosy-red bottles with level numbers, while Salon Selectives conditioners were in lighter pink ones bearing letter labels signifying type. Popularized by Helene Curtis, the brand proved to be a success, with 6.5 percent market share and annual sales of $275 million in the late 90s (making it the second most successful hair care brand in the US). Revamped theme-based lineup (2000-2006) During 2000, the Salon Selectives product line was revamped. Most notably, the product line was no longer sold in the distinctive red and pink bottles. The then-new theme-based product line was introduced during September 2000; products bore catchy names, and were all housed in clear containers. The revitalization of the Salon Selectives brand (early 2011) In 2010, the rights to the Salon Selectives brand was acquired by CLT International, a global health and beauty trader and brand acquisition company. CLT brought back a line of hair care products (including shampoo, conditioner, styling aids and hair brushes) in early 2011. The red and pink bottles and green apple scent have been restored. In addition to conventional advertising vehicles, CLT International is launching an aggressive social media campaign (featuring sites like Facebook and Twitter) to target a younger and broader demographic. Salon Selectives is, as of 2018, being marketed as a discount brand, with its standard size bottle available at a constant one- dollar price point.

Background After the Japanese Imperial Force occupied Manchuria following the Mukden Incident in 1931, it attempted to follow up with an invasion into northern China. Between June and July 1935, the Chin-Doihara Agreement was negotiated between Japan and the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) government as a way for the former to gain control of Chahar Province. A puppet state known as \\"Eastern Hebei Anti- Communist Autonomous Government\\" was then set up by a Yin Rugeng with Japanese help. In response to the demands by Japan to create a separate regime in Northern China, the KMT government was forced to establish the \\"Hebei-Chahar Political Council\\". The Chinese Communists, on the other hand, called for a voluntary mobilization of all Chinese people to resist Japanese aggression in a proclamation published on August 1, 1935. Preparation Student leader Huang Jing making a speech from a tram. On November 18, student representatives from several major universities in Beiping gathered in a meeting and secretly formed the Beiping Students Union. An election was held and Guo Mingqiu became the executive president while the communists selected Huang Jing and Yao Yilin to participate in leading the Students Union. On December 3, the Beiping Students Union decided to correspond with as many universities as possible to organize a mass petition. Three days later, 15 schools published a declaration opposing the formation of the Anti-Communist Autonomous Government of Northern China. It demanded the KMT government to arrest Yin Rugeng and also called for a national armed resistance against Japan. A 9-point political agenda was passed the same day, among which called for the KMT to immediately stop its armed campaign against the communists in the Chinese Civil War. Since December 9 was rumored to be the day that the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee was to be established, the Students Union chose that day for the petition. Events On the early morning of December 9, police and soldiers surrounded many schools and closed the city gate at Xizhimen. Petition students were enraged. They successfully broke the police enclosure lines. At around 10:30, they arrived at the Beiping branch of the KMT Military Committee in Zhongnanhai. In front of the Xinhua Gate, they sent the petition letters to He Yingqin, then head of the KMT Military. Angry students waved their arms and shouted slogans such as \\"Down with Japanese imperialism\\" and \\"Immediately stop the civil war\\", while a 6-point demand was given to the KMT government headquarter. # Oppose the Autonomous Government of Northern China and similar organizations; # Oppose any secret deals between China and Japan and immediately publicize the diplomatic policies combating the current crisis; # Protect and secure freedom of speech, of press, and of assembly; # Stop the civil war and prepare for a self-defense war against external threats; # Prohibit arbitrary arrest of the people; # Immediately free students who were arrested. Representatives of He Yingqin was able to talk to the students, but they refused to let students open Xizhimen so that Tsinghua and Yenching university students can enter the city. Students then began to march en masse. The number of marching students subsequently increased to about 6,000. When the line entered Xidan and East Chang'an Avenue, some students were attacked by police and soldiers armed with wooden sticks, whips, water pumps and sabers. Hundreds were injured and more than 30 were arrested. Students from Tsinghua and Peking University who were unable to enter the city via the gates stood their ways outside the city wall in bitter cold. Some of the students wept in telling surrounding residents about atrocities the Japanese army committed in Manchuria. They blamed on the KMT government for its non-resistance policy. At the end of the day, this movement by the students forced the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee to adjourn its planned opening. National response The protest movement was supported by students all over the country. Response was very positive as similar petitions and assemblies were organized in many large cities. The Students Union in Communist-occupied Shaanxi-Gansu district also sent telegraph to voice their support. On December 18, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions called for its workers to protest the betrayal by Japan and the arrest of numerous students in Beiping. Meanwhile, Lu Xun and Soong Ching-ling wrote articles in praise of the brave actions done by the students in Beiping. They and other social elites donated money in support. In Beiping, a propaganda troupe was also organized in which students from Beiping would tell peasants living in nearby provinces about the need of resistance against future Japanese aggression. Impact Memorial to the December 9th Movement in the Beijing Botanical Garden. The student demonstrations generated a public outcry and forced the formation of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council to be postponed to December 18, 1935.Saburo Ienaga, Pacific War, 1931-1945 Random House, 2010 p.88 The movement also boosted the profile and prestige of Communist student activists at a time when the Kuomintang-led government was actively suppressing Communists. After the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in 1949, the December 9 Movement has been commemorated as a patriotic movement. In 1985, during the 50th Anniversary of the December 9 Movement, students demonstrated in Beijing, calling for democracy and reform to save the nation.Gerard Barmi, \\"History for the Masses\\" in Jonathan Unger ed.

The test measures a person's heart rates at different loads (e.g. faster speeds on a treadmill). The points are plotted on a graph with heart rate on one axis and power (or some correlated measurement such as running speed) on the other axis; the graph's deflection point indicates the aerobic threshold. The heart rate increases (approximately) linearly up to the deflection point, where the heart rate reaches AT (also known as LT, lactate threshold, in more modern nomenclature). The test continues for a while, under increasing load, until the subject has gone well past the anaerobic threshold. Accuracy Two studies from the mid 90s showed the Conconi test to be inaccurate and impractical in assessing the anaerobic threshold, while other recent studies are disputing or have disputed this contention, and still others proposed modifications to improve the test.

Born at Axbridge, Somerset, England, he was a member of the Hardy family famous for the Hardy Wine Company. He emigrated to Australia when he was about 15 years old, but later returned to Europe, studying at the Pasteur Institute of Paris, from which he obtained either a D.Sc. or a PhD on returning to Australia he worked at the Royal Park Laboratories in Melbourne, before taking up the position of Government Botanist with the Department of Agriculture in 1911. In 1917 he retired, apparently returning to his family's wine business in South Australia. He died in 1931 in Kensington Gardens, Adelaide. Stoward specialised in fermentation and other chemical processes, publishing papers like On the Influence Exercised by certain Acids on the Inversion of Saccharose by Sucrase and On Endospermic Respiration in Certain Seeds. He did not publish any taxa, and so does not have a botanical author abbreviation. He did, however, collect the type of Eucalyptus stowardii, which was named in Stoward's honour by Joseph Maiden in 1917.

Career A professional right arm medium face round arm bowler, he took 165 wickets at 17.17, with a best of 6 for 18 while, as a right-handed late order batsman, he scored 935 runs at 12.63, with a best of 66. He took 32 catches, and bowled with an economy rate of 1.96. After the end of his playing career, he served as an umpire in first-class cricket. 1863 was the first year of first-class cricket, and Atkinson appeared for Yorkshire in 1861 and 1862. He also appeared in first-class cricket for Yorkshire and Durham (1858), the United England Eleven (1859-1869), North of England (1859-1870), The Players (1863), England (1863), Cambridgeshire and Yorkshire (1864) and the United North of England Eleven (1870-1871). He played against 22 Gentlemen of Hampshire for the United England Eleven in September 1860, in a non first-class fixture, and took 6 wickets for 15 in 32 overs, as the 22 Gentlemen were bowled out for 57 in 97.1 overs. He was run out for 4, batting at number 11, in England's innings but these runs proved vital as they enabled the United XI to take a first innings lead of 2. The 22 Gentlemen were bowled out for 47 in their second innings, with none of the 22 batsman passing double figures, and Atkinson taking 8 for 22 in 30 overs, in an unchanged partnership with John Lilywhite, who took 11 for 25. The England XI won by seven wickets. He umpired at least 26 first- class fixtures, the first the clash between Gentlemen of the North and Gentlemen of the South in August 1859, and the last of them the friendly match between Warwickshire and Gloucestershire at Edgbaston in August 1894.

Distribution, habitat, and ecology Klamath lupine is distributed from northeastern California to southern Oregon. This plant enjoys mesic conditions, and lives in wet, shady to open, sunny clay banks along streams and on the margins of meadows, within higher elevation conifer woodlands. \\"Broadleaf lupine (Lupinus latifolius) is likely top-killed by fire. Established plants are probably resistant to fire- induced mortality because of perennating buds on the deep, lateral root system. It is likely that these characteristics provide for regeneration following fire. Depending on the severity of top-kill by fire, sprouting from the caudex would also be a possibility. Information is lacking on the regeneration of broadleaf lupine seed after fire. Research to date (2006) suggests that broadleaf lupine responds favorably to fire. It was reportedly common or abundant after fire in many locations. The current body of research provides no clear direction for using fire as a management tool for broadleaf lupine populations. The research discussed [in the article] does, however, indicate that fire has a positive influence on broadleaf lupine.\\" Conservation status and threats U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Region Sensitive Species California Native Plant Society List 1B.2 NatureServe California State Rank: S1.2; Global Rank: G1 This plant is threatened by grazing (NatureServe).

He went on to pursue medical education at the prestigious Calcutta Medical College in Kolkata, and later at Liverpool (1934) and Edinburgh (1936). Banerjee had joined the Royal Navy in 1937 at Liverpool, and saw action in World War II. After the war, Banerjee decided to move back to India. In 1952, he visited Assam as a locum-tenens to a Scottish doctor. in 1952 he joined Chabua Tea Estate, Assam, as Chief Medical Officer, and later moved to the Dhansiri Medical Association, Bokakhat as the Chief Medical Officer. During a visit to Kaziranga National Park some time in the 1950s, Banerjee fell in love with the wilds of Assam and decided to settle down at Golaghat, near Kaziranga. Banerjee's first film on the Kaziranga National Park (one of the most important refuges of the Indian rhinoceros) on Berlin TV in 1961 was one of the first widely distributed media items on the park to reach Western audiences. It also garnered him international recognition as a wildlife film-maker. He made 32 documentaries in his career as a film-maker, and was the recipient of 14 international awards. Banerjee remained a bachelor, and worked actively as an environmentalist besides his film-making career. Well known and loved among the local community as \\"Uncle Robin\\", he donated lands for setting up the local school, and health camps. He was particularly active regarding issues concerning Kaziranga National Park and was the founder of the non-governmental organization Kaziranga Wildlife Society, which actively protects the interests of the park.

His parents both came from families of vintners. At the age of fifteen, he became an apprentice at the School of the Interior and Decorative Painters Guild in Vienna. Johann was apprenticed to a series of master trainers in the painter's trade from April 1, 1898 until April 1, 1902. Until 1906, he continued to live and work near his home as a painter's assistant with a number of employers, some of whom were his former master instructors. His work ledger indicates a high level of satisfaction with his performance and demeanor. He was often let go \\"because of lack of available work.\\" In search of a more secure future, he shortened his name to Mallin and came to the United States in 1907.Mallin, Katherine. \\"John Anton Mallin: Ecclesiastical Artist and Decorator in Twentieth-Century Chicago\\", Sacred Architecture Journal, vol. 32, Fall 2017, Institute for Sacred Architecture, Notre Dame University He settled in Chicago. One of his first jobs was as a decorator of fa√ßades for the Riverview Amusement Park in Chicago. In 1918, he formed his own decorating company, John A. Mallin, Interior Art Decorations. He specialized in church decoration and ecclesiastical painting as well as art glass and mosaics. He stated his philosophy in one of his commercial brochures: \\"As there is nothing too good for God, so there is nothing too rich or too precious for God's earthly homes, His churches...\\"McNamara, Denis Robert.

Michigan Avenue in the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District. His business flourished. In one of his brochures, he lists over 50 churches as references, most in Chicago, but some in Indiana, Michigan, Iowa and Tennessee. Eventually, he moved his studio to 2252 W. Devon Avenue. His son joined the studio and specialized in gold leaf applications. He decorated more than 100 churches in his lifetime. He died On January 9, 1973, at the age of eighty-nine.

History During the first decade of 20th century, Jews persecuted by the Czar Nicholas II of Russia from different places in the world began arriving in Argentina. They settled down mainly in the provinces of Entre Rios and Santa Fe in colonies established by the Jewish Colonization Association, with a seat in London and directed by Baron Maurice de Hirsch.

Biography=Early life= Vakha Arsanov was born in 1950 in the Dagestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. He worked as a Soviet traffic police captain. In 1991, Arsanov supported Dzhokar Dudayev's National Congress of Chechen People and became a deputy in Dudayev's parliament. During the First Chechen War, Arsanov became a military commander for the Chechen separatist forces, reaching the rank of Divisional General. He took part in the Battle of Dolinskoye, the Battle of Grozny, and others. After the Chechens retook Grozny in August 1996, Arsanov declared that \\"Russia does have a strong army, but they weaken themselves... The Chechens have morale and a spirit... We know what we are fighting for and what we are dying for. The Russians just want to go home to mother or to their beloved girl. They don't need this war.\\" After the war, in January 1997, he ran on the same ticket as the separatist forces' chief of staff Aslan Maskhadov. The two won Chechnya's presidential election, garnering almost 300,000 votes. =Vice-President of Chechnya= In February 1997, \\"a remote-controlled bomb blast damaged two cars\\" in Arsanov's motorcade in central Grozny; his press spokesman claimed the attack was \\"'a carefully planned operation by the Russian secret services,' designed to destabilize Chechnya by provoking conflict between supporters of [Maskhadov] and Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, the outgoing acting president.\\" In April, Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov announced the arrests of two Chechen women suspected of involvement in the 1995 Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis and the April 28 bombing of Pyatigorsk that killed two. Arsanov denied a Chechen connection to the bombings in Pyatigorsk and Armavir, instead accusing the Russian secret services of organizing the Pyatigorsk bombing in order to \\"sabotage the peace process. He also suggested \\"that ongoing peace talks with Russia should be suspended until Kulikov apologized.\\" However, Chechen First Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov stated that peace talks would continue. In May, Russian leaders formally apologized for the incident in which Russian fighter aircraft intercepted Arsanov's plane shortly after it took off from Grozny to the Netherlands. In September, Arsanov threatened to \\"execute\\" Russian Cabinet leaders for their \\"genocide\\" during the war and said to \\"spit\\" on Russia; the Russian government demanded that Arsanov retract his \\"insulting statements\\" and apologize, but he did not. In November, Arsanov served as the acting president while Maskhadov was on vacation. In July 1998, together with Shamil Basayev, Arsanov saved the \\"Wahhabi\\" forces aided by renegade former generals Arbi Barayev and Abdul-Malik Mezhidov from total destruction during the confrontation with the Maskhadov's government forces in Gudermes. In an August 1998 televised conference, Arsanov said that by attacking Afghanistan and Sudan, the United States had launched an \\"undeclared World War III\\" and ordered a global attack against the Americans; he said that Bill Clinton \\"had been put on the 'wanted list' for his crimes against the Islamic people and would be tried according to Shariah laws\\". In December, Arsanov defected to the opposition, which was agitating for a new Islamist state constitution. Arsanov was accused of corruption and involvement in criminal activity, including kidnappings of foreignersHawks and Doves Circle over Chechnya Retrieved March 23, 2008 and connections with the Chechen mafia in Moscow. In February 1999, Arsanov was sacked when a presidential decree abolished his post, but he said he would not leave office unless President Maskhadov also stepped down. He said the republic's top Islamic body, the Shura, should be allowed to select a new national leadership to transform Chechnya into an Islamic state. After the Second Chechen War broke out in 1999, Arsanov announced in October that the State Defense Council \\"had decided to forbid Chechen leaders from conducting negotiations or getting in touch with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin\\". He also demanded that the Chechens would only meet with the Russians \\"on neutral ground\\"; that an international organization would supervise and implement a Russian-Chechen agreement; and that Russian forces would withdraw from Chechnya. In October, Arsanov \\"ruled out holding political negotiations with Russia, saying that Chechnya expects Europe and the United States to pressure Russia into ending the military operation.\\" In February 2000, Arsanov, together with Basayev, were reported to have announced the start of \\"total military actions on the whole of Russian territory.\\" He soon disappeared in Georgia, where he was treated for an injury, appearing publicly in the presence of President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze,The Security Organs of the Russian Federation (Part IV) Retrieved March 23, 2008 and later reportedly moved to Nazran in Ingushetia.U.S. Know-How Doesn't Work in Chechnya Retrieved March 23, 2008 He resurfaced in 2001 to call Chechen resistance against Russia \\"pointless,\\" and Mashkhadov fired him, saying, \\"‚ÄúHe could have fallen into the hands of the Federals at any time and they could‚Äôve forced him to take part in the negotiations.\\" =Late life and death= In February 2003, the AFP reported that Arsanov issued a video call to the Chechen resistance to put stop attacks on pro-Moscow Chechen militias. According to Russian media reports, he became close with Akhmad Kadyrov, the pro-Moscow head of the republic, who asked the federal center for an amnesty for Arsanov; other sources state that he and Isa Munayev remained the last commanders still fully loyal to Maskhadov. According to the Kommersant report,Report: Arsanov Arrested The Moscow Times Arsanov was detained by the Chechen OMON, led by the former separatist commander Artur Akhmadov. In February 2005, the separatists protested the alleged arrest and detention of Arsanov by the Russians. On May 15, 2005, Russia announced that during a raid in the village of Ivanovo, a suburb of Grozny, pro-Russian police and militia forces killed four militants, including Arsanov. The death was shrouded in mystery; the bodies were reported to be burned too badly to be identified, and separatists alleged that Arsanov was actually in Russian custody at the time. According to some reports, Arsanov was held in Ramzan Kadyrov's private prison in Tsentoroi and unsuccessfully tortured there in an attempt to make him cooperate with the young Kadyrov against Maskhadov.Fate of Former Chechen VP Remains Mysterious The Jamestown Foundation.

Backhouse was born in Sheriff Hutton, Yorkshire, England, and was a right-handed batsman and left arm medium pace bowler. Playing for Yorkshire against the Rest of England in the Champion County match at The Oval in September 1931, Backhouse bowled four overs for four runs, as the Rest were bowled out for 124 by Bill Bowes and Hedley Verity. He was bowled by Bill Voce for two runs, batting at number 10 in his only innings, and was not asked to bowl again when the Rest compiled 290 second time around in a drawn game. His second and final first-class match was scarcely more successful, when he turned out the following year at Lord's for the MCC against Kent. He was out for 0 and 1, but did take three wickets for 130 in Kent's mammoth 431. He beat captain Arthur Chapman to have him stumped by Franklin for 72, dismissed B.H. Valentine in the same manner for 45 and then bowled W.H. Ashdown for 7. His labours were in vain as Kent won the match by 10 wickets. This was not his first appearance at Lord's as, in 1927, he had taken four wickets playing for the Young Professionals against the Young Amateurs, in a non first-class fixture. He went on to play Minor Counties cricket for Staffordshire between 1934 and 1936. He died in a motor accident in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, in November 1936, at the age of 35.

She has won the UCI BMX World Championships three times.Shanaze Reade crowned BMX world champion for third time Reade is the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Irish mother. Early years Reade began racing in 1998 at the age of 10, at Tipkinder Park in Crewe. A local track operator named Bob Field, whose son also raced at the time, became her mentor. She was previously a Track & Field enthusiast but apparently got bored with 100-metre sprint running and the Shot Put after five years in those sports before discovering BMX. BMX career to 2007 In 2005, she raced the National series with the men all year, despite being only 17 years old. She commented on racing against men in a Descent World interview: Reade fractured her knee two weeks before the UCI World Championships in July 2005 at a national event in England. She raced the World Championships with her knee wrapped up and on pain killers but crashed in the quarter finals. Known for her power, she developed her strength racing against boys and older amateurs, including men up to the present time. She won her first professional race in the Girls Pro at the American Bicycle Association (ABA) Winternationals in Phoenix, Arizona on 1 April 2006. She also won the following day.BMX Plus! July 2006 Vol.29 No.7 pg.69 (results) In 2006, she became British National No.1 in 19 & Over Elite Men after racing the National series with men all year, despite being only 17 at the time, 1.72 metres tall and 76 kg. In June 2006, Reade broke a metatarsal bone in practice. Her first race back was the 2006 European Championships where she competed only in the last two race events before the final Event. The cast came off four days before the European Championships Final Event. She won the World Championships in Brazil in August 2006 despite an earlier injury to her foot. Her BMX victories at junior level include three World, eight European and five British BMX championships. Reade is also a champion track racer, riding on Velodromes. In July 2007 she became the Women's Senior UCI BMX World Champion and at the 2007 UCI Track World Championships, she won the gold in the women's team sprint with Victoria Pendleton. It was only her second track race ever. Not only was she the first ever to win a track championship in her rookie year, she completed the feat after only six weeks of training. She had originally taken up the sport to keep her fit for BMX competition. Track racing Reade started track racing on 24 February 2007, her first ever competition on the velodrome was in the Manchester round of the 2006‚Äì2007 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics. She took second place with Anna Blyth in the Team Sprint in a time of 34.294 seconds. The Gold Medal-winning Dutch team of Yvonne Hijgenaar and Willy Kanis' time was 33.966 seconds. Like Reade, Kanis is also a champion BMX racer. Reade and Blyth's qualifying time was the fastest of the event at 33.802 seconds. In the final round, the Dutch team made a false start, however, Reade didn't notice the call back to the start and completed a lap at full sprint. In a post race interview, Reade said: Reade and Victoria Pendleton in 2008 A month later, on 29 March, Reade went on to take first place in Team Sprint at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Palma de Mallorca along with Victoria Pendleton. It was also the first ever Women's Team Sprint Gold Medal title in that event. Their winning time was 33.631 seconds. Reade was a last minute replacement for Anna Blyth, Reade's partner at her first track racing event a month prior. This success in Velodrome racing follows the example of the former professional BMX racer, Jamie Staff, who had a successful career both in Velodrome track racing and BMX racing. At the 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Manchester, she again won the gold in the women's team sprint with Pendleton. On 20 November 2007 Reade was named The Sunday Times Young Sportswoman of the Year. Olympic Games Reade is still active in track racing but concentrated on BMX for the event's first inclusion in the Olympic Games in 2008. Having successfully defended her crown at the 2008 world championships, Reade was named the sole woman member of the United Kingdom BMX Olympic team by British Cycling on 9 July 2008. She was the favourite to win the gold medal in the women's BMX event. She crashed in the first qualifying heat time trial, but the second heat saw Reade set second fastest time. As the best of both times was counted; she advanced to the semi-finals. They were run in three heats, with riders accumulating points dependendent on placings. Despite crashing in the first heat, Reade gained enough points to put her through to the final. The final round saw Reade ride slightly more conservatively conceding the lead to Anne-Caroline Chausson on the first berm. She crashed again on the final berm when she clipped Chausson's rear wheel, conceding the chance of a medal. She did not finish the race. Return to the track On 16 March 2009, Reade was selected in the British squad for the World Track Cycling Championships in Pruszk√≥w, Poland, where she once again competed alongside Victoria Pendleton in the Women's Sprint and Team Sprint events. In 2009 however Reade and Pendleton failed to retain their team crown, winning only a silver after losing out to Kaarle McCulloch and Anna Meares of Australia. Reade was philosophical after this setback telling BBC Sport \\"I did the best possible ride I could do on the day so I'm really happy.\\" In April 2015 it was announced that Reade was re-joining the Great Britain track squad after a period based in the United States competing in BMX. Subsequently, in August 2015 the team announced that Reade would ride for them during the 2015‚Äì16 track cycling season as part of her preparation for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Olympics 2012 Reade again represented Great Britain in the women's BMX event for the London 2012 Olympics. Having placed first, second and first in the three heat semi-final she finished a disappointing sixth in the final.  Retirement and comeback  In April 2017 Reade announced her retirement from competition. After her retirement she became a fitness coach. However, in August 2018 she returned to training at British Cycling, after being invited several times by performance director Stephen Park. In a January 2019 interview, Reade explained that she was returning to competition for \\"closure\\" after feeling that her physical and mental condition were sub-optimal at the time of her retirement, adding that she was now treating the sport as a hobby and not accepting funding for her cycling. That month she won the British National Team Sprint Championships alongside Blaine Ridge-Davis - her first national title in any discipline.

The allies, commanded by the Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev, captured the town of Gagra from the undermanned Georgian forces (which were reportedly fewer in numbers but possessed more tanks and armoured personnel carriers)The HRW 1995, p. 25 in a surprise attack, leading to an outbreak of ethnic cleansing of local Georgian population. The battle proved to be one of the bloodiest in the war and is widely considered to be a turning point in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. The action, in which Russian commanders were suspected to have aided to the attackers, also resulted in a significant deterioration of the Georgian-Russian relations.  Background  Gagra is a Black Sea resort town in northwest Abkhazia, near the international border between Georgia and the Russian Federation. Georgian forces took control of the town from the Abkhaz insurgent militia in the August 1992 amphibious operation in an effort to push an offensive southward against the rebel-held enclave around Gudauta, where the Abkhaz secessionist leadership had taken refuge after the Georgian government forces had entered the regional capital of Sukhumi. Gudauta was also a home to the Soviet-era Russian military base, consisting of the 643rd anti-aircraft missile regiment and a supply unit, which were used to funnel arms to the Abkhaz.Seely, p. 192. After initial military setback, Abkhaz leaders urged Russia and the CMPC to intervene in the conflict. The Confederation responded by declaring war on Georgia and by sending hundreds of its fighters to the Abkhaz side. Meanwhile, the Russian government arranged, on 3 September 1992, a truce which left Georgian government in control of most of Abkhazia but obliged it to withdraw a large part of its troops and hardware from Gagra and its environs. The conflicting sides resumed the negotiations concerning Abkhazia‚Äôs status within Georgia whose inviolable territorial integrity was emphasized in the ceasefire agreement.Seely, p. 193  Assault on Gagra  Map of Abkhazia The truce was not to last long, however. Shortly thereafter, the Abkhaz side declared that the Georgian government had failed to complete the withdrawal of its troops from the Gagra zone. However, according to Russian Army Lieutenant General Sufiyan Bepayev, deputy commander of the Transcaucasian Military District, the Georgians had complied with the 3 September accords and by 30 September had withdrawn 1,200 troops and their corresponding equipment from the area.Duffy Toft, p. 104. On 1 October, one week after the Supreme Soviet of Russia had passed a motion condemning Georgia‚Äôs policy in Abkhazia and demanding Russian peacekeepers, the combined Abkhaz and North Caucasian forces resumed hostilities and launched an offensive against Gagra. They were commanded by the then little-known Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev,Reports on how Basayev arrived in Abkhazia are conflicting. He received personal orders from Yusuf Soslambekov, head the Parliament of the CMPC, to lead a volunteer battalion into Abkhazia. Georgian officials claimed that the Russian security services sent buses to Grozny, Chechnya, to take Basayev, Ruslan Gelayev and others to the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone. However, Basayev and dozens of his fighters are known to have left Chechnya on their own car caravan. They did commander a Russian passenger bus to Karachay-Cherkessia, where the passengers were freed after the local police (militsiya) allegedly received orders from a higher authority to abandon the chase so Basayev and his men could go on to Abkhazia. Murphy, p. 14 who had been appointed Deputy Minister of Defense in the Abkhaz secessionist government and put in charge of the Gagra front.Murphy, p. 14. The offensive included T-72 tanks, Grad rocket launchers, and other heavy equipment that the Abkhaz had not previously possessed. The allies were aided by combat helicopters and Su-25 bombers.MacKinlay, p. 89 The type and quantity of equipment that helped advance the Abkhaz offensive was the first and primary cause of Georgian suspicions of Russian assistance to the secessionists.Aybak, p. 190 Russian border guards were accused of at least not preventing the North Caucasian militants from crossing into Abkhazia.Jim Flowers (Spring 1999), Who Gave Guns (and Troops and Planes) to the Abkhaz?. Modus Vivendi ‚Äì Rhodes Student Journal of International Studies. Accessed March 31, 2007. The Georgian side also accused the Russians of assisting the attackers by imposing a naval blockade of the coastline, in addition to claiming that Deputy Minister of Defense of the Russian Federation G. Kolesnikov was directly responsible for planning the operation.Vakhtang Kholbaia, Raphiel Gelantia, David Latsuzbaia, Teimuraz Chakhrakia (trans. Nana Japaridze-Chkhoidze; 1999), Labyrinth of Abkhazia , page 34. The Parliament of Georgia, Tbilisi. The Georgian Shavnabada Battalion was caught by surprise, losing almost all of its parked heavy vehicles, but managed to build up a defensive line at the southwestern edges to the city and the beach site. Artillery batteries, which had been already placed on the southern heights prior to the battle, had good line of sight on the town and its surroundings. The Abkhaz-North Caucasian alliance advanced with full force toward the city center in an attempt to overwhelm the defenders by sheer manpower. The initial assault was met with heavy resistance and shelling. Georgian soldiers and artillery in particular dealt heavy losses to the attackers and forced them to retreat. The Shavnabada Battalion, along with a platoon of mixed special forces units, mounted a counterattack and made the alliance forces disperse and rout into the northeastern forests. The Abkhaz-North Caucasian combatants' fighting morale was at the edge of collapse and a large number of them started to disband. However, the alliance re-consolidated its forces, gathered sufficient numbers, and mounted another massive offensive. With most equipment already lost in the surprise attack, Georgian forces ran out of options and considered abandoning Gagra the next day. Special forces leader Gocha Karkarashvili, younger brother of overall commander Giorgi Karkarashvili, insisted on remaining in town with a number of men in order to halt the attackers until reinforcements arrived, despite the remoteness of this possibility. He and a small number of commandos and armed Georgian civilians entrenched themselves in the police and railway stations. The outnumbered Georgians were able to defend these two positions for a while until they were completely surrounded and overrun. The Abkhazians identified 11 members of the elite unit White Eagles, including its leader. Most of the aiding militias were captured. The 13th Battalion and special forces elements became entangled in a losing fight with a second large group of combatants approaching from the nearby forests which led to a full retreat.Duffy Toft, page 104. As it became apparent that Georgian forces were abandoning Gagra completely due to internal rivalries intensifying in Georgia's capital, thousands of Georgian civilians fled to the villages of Gantiadi and Leselidze immediately north of the town. In the days that followed these villages also fell, adding to the flight of refugees to the Russian border. Russian border guards allowed some Georgian civilians and military personnel to cross the border and then transported them to Georgia proper.The HRW 1995, p. 32. According to some sources, the elder Karkarashvili and some of his men were also evacuated by helicopter to Russian territory.The HRW 1995, p. 26. Those Georgians who remained in Gagra and the surrounding villages were subjected to a violent reprisal campaign orchestrated by Basayev and Abkhaz militants (many of whom were refugees who had fled Georgian forces earlier and sought revenge for what they themselves had been forced to endure). According to several accounts, one hundred Georgians were herded into the central stadium in Gagra where they were decapitated, their heads used as footballs in a soccer match. In 2001 Vladimir Putin mentioned this when speaking about Georgia's lack of cooperation in fighting Chechen militants: \\"The Georgian authorities seem to have forgotten how Chechen terrorists used the heads of Georgians as footballs during the Abkhazian crisis. Yes, unfortunately, that is a fact.\\" Official Georgian sources put 429 as the number of civilians who were killed during the battle or in its immediate aftermath. Mikheil Jincharadze, an influential Georgian politician from Gagra who served as Deputy Chairman of Supreme Council of Abkhazia, was captured in his house and executed at the mercy of his Abkhazian friends.The Parliament of Georgia report ‚ÄúGenocide/Ethnic cleansing in Abkhazia: Ciphers, facts...‚Äù. 1999. The battle of Gagra triggered the first allegations of Russian aid to the separatists and marked the beginning of a rapid worsening of Georgia‚Äôs relations with Russia. By the end of October, the head of the Georgian government, Eduard Shevardnadze, had halted talks on the Russian mediation, declaring that because of Russia‚Äôs \\"undisguised interference, including military interference... in the internal affairs of sovereign Georgia, we have no other choice.\\"Duffy Toft, page 104 The seesaw fighting around Gagra continued until 6 October 1992. After the capture of Gagra, the Abkhaz-CMPC forces quickly gained control of the strategic area along the Russian border and made steady progress down the coast from Gagra to the Gumista River northwest of Sukhumi, placing the regional capital itself at risk.Seely, p. 193; Ekedahl and Goodman, p. 267; MacKinlay, p. 89 Georgian refugees fled to Russia through the land border or were evacuated by the Russian navy.Human Rights Watch report GEORGIA/ABKHAZIA: VIOLATIONS OF THE LAWS OF WAR AND RUSSIA'S ROLE IN THE CONFLICT, March 1995  Notes  References  *Aybak, Tun√ß (2001), Politics of the Black Sea: Dynamics of Cooperation and Conflict.

In , at age 34, Grissom finally established himself as a Major League pitcher, going 12‚Äì10 (3.74) in 28 games (24 as a starter) and 166 innings pitched, with seven complete games and one shutout. The following February, he was one of three ChiSox hurlers swapped to the pitching-poor Red Sox for veteran shortstop Vern Stephens. But after a promising start to his campaign, Grissom's Red Sox career unraveled when he allowed 12 hits and 12 earned runs in only 2‚Öì innings over two outings against the Cleveland Indians at Fenway Park on June 24‚Äì25. His ERA ballooned from 3.05 to 4.78, and after only one more appearance, Grissom was placed on waivers. He was claimed by the Giants on July 1. He got into 21 games for them, with seven starts and three complete games. He also began to pitch out of the bullpen for manager Leo Durocher, although he recorded no saves that year. Stalwart relief pitcher But in , Grissom found his niche as one of Durocher's ace relief pitchers ‚Äî Hall of Famer Hoyt Wilhelm was the other ‚Äî as he helped the Giants win the National League pennant. He led the club in saves (17, third in the league) and won ten other games, nine in relief. Grissom was named to the National League All-Star team and finished 24th in voting for NL MVP Award.Appearances on Leader Boards, Awards, and Honors at baseball-reference.com In 122‚Öì innings pitched, he had 64 strikeouts and a 2.35 earned run average. Then, in the 1954 World Series against the Indians, Grissom was the winning pitcher in Game 1, the contest marked by Willie Mays' classic, over-the-shoulder catch of Vic Wertz' long drive to center field. Grissom came into the game in relief of Don Liddle in the eighth inning, immediately after Mays' catch, with the game tied, 2‚Äì2. He proceeded to pitch 2 innings of one-hit ball, and held Cleveland off the scoreboard until pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes won the game with a three-run, walk-off home run in the tenth inning.Retrosheet It was Grissom's only appearance in the Series, as the Giants swept Cleveland in four straight games.Postseason Pitching Statistics at baseball-reference.com Grissom also shone as a relief pitcher for the next four seasons, leading the Giants in saves three more times (1955; 1957‚Äì58). He was a member of the last Giants' team to represent New York City, and the first one based in San Francisco. Traded to the Cardinals in October 1958, he was able to appear in only three games for the 1959 Redbirds before a back injury forced his retirement as an active player at the age of 41. In ten MLB seasons, Grissom had a 47‚Äì45 record, 356 games (52 started), 12 complete games, three shutouts, 58 saves, and a career 3.41 ERA. He allowed 771 hits and 343 bases on balls in 810 total innings pitched, with 459 strikeouts. Pitching coach After his playing career, Grissom had a 15-year-long tenure as a pitching coach for four MLB teams: the Los Angeles/California Angels (during three separate terms: 1961‚Äì66; 1969; 1977‚Äì78), White Sox (1967‚Äì68), Minnesota Twins (1970‚Äì71) and Chicago Cubs (1975‚Äì76).An Interview With Marv Grissom at thediamondangle.com He also spent time with the San Francisco Giants.I have a photo with him in a Giants uniform, along with my Uncle and Grandfather.

He was born at Marsden, West Riding of Yorkshire. A product of Golcar Cricket Club, where he lived most of his early life, he was professional with Lightcliffe from 1948‚Äì53 and 1955. A specialist wicket-keeper, he took 948 catches and completed 178 stumpings in a career that spanned two decades from 1951 to 1970, and 468 first-class games. He took another 28 catches and made two stumpings in his List A one-day matches. Career Booth came late to first- class cricket, not making his debut for his native Yorkshire until he was 24, and was a fringe player in the Yorkshire team until the retirement of Don Brennan at the end of the 1953 season. He was then first choice for Yorkshire in 1954 and in the first half of 1955, but lost his place mid-season to Jimmy Binks. He joined Worcestershire on special registration for the 1956 season, won his county cap in his first season and was then the regular wicket-keeper for the team for the next thirteen seasons, during which time the county achieved greater success than at any time before. The side came second in the County Championship for the first time in 1962 and two years later went one better, winning the title for the first time. They retained the Championship in 1965. Booth's contribution to the success was substantial. Taller than many wicket-keepers of the period, he seemed well-equipped to handle Worcestershire's battery of fast-medium bowlers in the late 1950s, led by Jack Flavell and Len Coldwell. But the emergence from 1960 of a more balanced bowling attack, with the arrival of first Doug Slade and then Norman Gifford, both slow left-arm, not only gave Worcestershire a Championship-winning edge but also showed Booth to be among the best all-round wicket-keepers in the country at the time. Despite his record, he appears never to have been close to Test selection, as the long-standing Godfrey Evans was succeeded as England wicketkeeper by a series of players (Roy Swetman, John Murray, Geoff Millman, Jim Parks) a few years younger than Booth. Booth set records for both season and career dismissals for Worcestershire, though his career total has since been overtaken by Steve Rhodes. He is the last wicket-keeper to have completed 100 dismissals in an English first-class season, and achieved this feat twice, in 1960, when he made 101 dismissals and in the Championship-winning season of 1964, when he made exactly 100 dismissals. With the reduction in first-class matches that has taken place in the years since, it is unlikely that this feat will ever be repeated, and Booth is one of only seven keepers to have achieved this milestone. Booth had no great reputation for batting when he joined Worcestershire, having made only one score of more than 50 in five seasons with Yorkshire. But he turned himself into a highly effective lower middle- order batsman with a very upright stance and a \\"correct\\" batting style. In 1959, he made 1,042 runs, the only time he passed 1,000 runs in a season ‚Äì though two years later, in 1961, he was within two runs of a potential record. In this season, he made 998 runs with just one innings of over 50 and a highest score of just 54: had he scored those two runs, he would have had the \\"lowest highest score\\" of any player completing 1,000 runs in an English season, a record at present held by his Worcestershire colleague, Dick Richardson. Booth maintained form and fitness into his forties, and acted as deputy captain for some years before his retirement at the end of the 1968 season. He returned for four first-class matches, and one List A game, in an injury crisis in 1970. He was a good footballer with Yorkshire Amateurs, and had he trials with Burnley F.C. Post-retirement Booth later worked for Worcestershire by serving on the committee for many years and held a term as club president. His wife Joyce ran the Ladies' Pavilion at New Road for over twenty years. He died on Monday, 24 September 2018 and a minute's silence was held at New Road before the Worcestershire v Yorkshire match began.

Built in 1872 on the Ohio River at Pittsburgh, the boat was long and had a beam. The ship ran aground and sank in 1882. However, a common legend claims that it mysteriously disappeared. Sinking The Iron Mountain sailed from Vicksburg on March 25, 1882, and hit an obstruction at Stumpy Point, near Island 102, which holed her hull and sank her. The crew scrambled onto one of the barges and escaped. Ellen Anderson, a chambermaid/ship stewardess, The Weekly Louisianian., April 01, 1882, Image 2 was caught below decks and killed. Her body was recovered the next day with some wreckage, but there was no sign of the ship. Further wreckage was found on June 30, several miles from where the boat was lost. The sinking of the ship was reported locally, with articles appearing in the March 27 edition of the Vicksburg Daily Commercial, and the March 28 issue of the Daily Memphis Avalanche.Other contemporary accounts of the ships loss The ship was not found until later, having apparently been refloated by flood waters and carried through a break in a levee, and grounded in a cotton field at Omega Landing, near Tallulah, Louisiana. Legend A common legend claims that it was travelling from New Orleans to Pittsburgh, loaded with cotton and sugar, when it disappeared. It sailed from Vicksburg, Mississippi, and headed north, towing a string of barges and with 55 crew and passengers aboard. Another steamer, the Iroquois Chief, found the Iron Mountains barges floating downriver, apparently having been cut loose, but the ship itself had vanished. This legend is often repeated as fact, as in Frank Edward's 1956 book, Strangest of All, Paul Begg's Into Thin Air (1979), the Reader's Digest's Mysteries of the Unexplained (1982), Louis L'Amour's The Haunted Mesa (1987), Charles Berlitz's World of Strange Phenomena (1988) and Herbie Brennan's Seriously Weird True Stories (1997). Most versions of the story give the date of the \\"disappearance\\" as 1872, which was the year of the ship's launching. In popular culture The legend was indirectly shown in the 2011 science fiction Western film Cowboys and Aliens. In this film there is a scene where a posse discover an upturned Mississippi riverboat in the middle of the desert in New Mexico. Although the boat's name is not shown or mentioned, it is presumed that it is the Iron Mountain that was dropped there by the extraterrestrials.

Deep versus superficial bundles There are two types of neurovascular bundles: superficial bundles and deep bundles. As arteries do not travel within the superficial fascia (loose connective tissue under the skin), superficial neurovascular bundles differ from deep neurovascular bundles in both composition and function. Superficial neurovascular bundles do not include arteries and consist primarily of capillaries and nerves. Because capillaries function as the sites for material exchange between interstitial fluid and blood, they tend to have large surface area and short diffusion path. Normally, capillaries consist of a central lumen lined with an endothelium, a single layer of smooth epithelial cells. In contrast, deep neurovascular bundles, i.e. bundles that include arteries, have a more complicated structure. Since arteries have high intraluminal blood pressure relative to capillaries and veins, these bundles have smooth muscle and connective tissue structures outside the endothelium. This structure allows arteries to contract, relax and remain flexible and transfer blood when under pressure. Risks to neurovascular bundles in surgeries Both superficial and deep neurovascular bundles are at risk during incisions in surgeries. =Leg surgery= In surgeries, the principle superficial neurovascular bundles at risk are, medially, the great saphenous vein and its accompanying nerve, and, laterally, the superficial peroneal nerve. The superficial peroneal nerve originates from the common peroneal nerve near the neck of the fibula and passes between the peroneus longus and brevis muscles, supplying motor branches to these muscles. The superficial branch then continues onto the dorsum of the foot to supply sensory fibers to the skin there. The main deep neurovascular bundle at risk is the posterior tibial. It lies on the posterior aspect of the tibialis posterior and flexor digitorum longus muscles, and medial to the belly of flexor hallucis longus. It also gives rise to medial plantar artery and lateral plantar artery. During surgery, these neurovascular bundles, both superficial and deep, should be protected in order to prevent neurological damage. A common anatomically informed, surgical technique to avoid damaging neurovascular bundles is to undermine anteriorly to the posterior tibial margin after reaching the fascia, in order to avoid the saphenous vein and nerve. The deep posterior compartment here is superficial and readily accessible. The fascia of the deep posterior compartment is carefully opened distally and proximally, under the belly of the soleus muscle, paying special attention to the posterior tibial neurovascular bundle. Through the same incision, the fascia of the superficial posterior compartment is opened widely, two centimeters posterior and parallel to the incision in the fascia of the deep compartment. =Prostate surgery= The preservation of both neurovascular bundles during nerve-sparing (NS) radical prostatectomy improves urinary continence and erectile function. Consequently, NS is recommended in elderly men and those with pre-existing erectile dysfunction, whom many surgeons would previously have only offered non-NS surgery. It was also found that during surgeries in which neurovascular bundles are preserved, the frequency of positive margins were only 5.8 percent.

It was developed as a reaction to the demand for a domestic airliner. At this time Deruluft, one of the forerunners of Aeroflot, flew only with foreign models, which were mainly German or Dutch. Design work began in December 1927. The first prototype, named Krylia Sovietov (Wings of the Soviets) used three French Gnome-Rhone Titan radial engines. It was presented to the public on 1 May 1929 at Red Square and it went to the national flight testing, which was completed in June. In the first series 12 aircraft were built. In production, the Titan engines were replaced with M-26 engines, but these proved too unreliable and were replaced with imported Wright Whirlwind engines. Two of these airplanes were used by Deruluft, starting from 1933 on the Berlin-Moscow service. Mikhail Gromov accomplished a European round flight on the route Moscow ‚Äì Travem√ºnde ‚Äì Berlin ‚Äì Paris ‚Äì Rome ‚Äì Marseille ‚Äì London ‚Äì Paris ‚Äì Berlin ‚Äì Warsaw ‚Äì Moscow with the Krylia Sovietov, which lasted from 10 July to 8 August 1929 and generated considerable publicity. It carried eight passengers over a distance of 9,037 km (5,615 mi), in 53 flying hours with an average speed of . In September 1930, testing of the Wright-powered version of the ANT-9 was completed. A few were used as executive transports for the Soviet Air Forces. A military variant with standard and retractable turrets was under construction, but was abandoned before trials began. An ambulance version was studied and considered, but never built. In 1932, GVF engineer Sergei Ivanovich Komarov proposed a modification of the ANT-9 wing to accommodate two M-17 engines, similar to what was done on the R-6. Production began in 1933 as the PS-9 (, passenger airplane). The number of aircraft built amounted to about 70 machines. Up to the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, they served as passenger or staff airplanes mainly on routes in Central Asia and the Caucasus. Afterwards they were used until 1943 as transportation and medical airplanes. One PS-9 was modified into a propaganda aircraft named Krokodil (Crocodile) with a reptile-like plywood nose.

Observations by William Herschel in 1785 suggested that the Milky Way was a disk-shaped galaxy with the sun in a central position. Although heliocentric, Herschel's observations were the first attempt at an observational cosmology. Herschel's heliocentric theory was overthrown by astronomer Harlow Shapley's work on globular clusters in 1918. Shapley's research marked the transition from heliocentrism to galactocentrism, placing the Galactic Center of the Milky Way Galaxy far away from the sun, towards Sagittarius. Heber Doust Curtis and Edwin Hubble further refuted the heliocentric view of the universe by showing that spirals are themselves far-flung galactic systems. By 1925, the galactocentric model was established. The theory of Galactocentrism was an important step in the development of cosmological models as speculation on the existence of other galaxies, comparable in size and structure to our own, placed the earth in its proper perspective with respect to the rest of the universe. Shifts from heliocentrism to galactocentrism and later acentrism have been compared in significance to the Copernican Revolution. William Herschel's Heliocentrism Thomas Wright and Kant first speculated that fuzzy patches of light called nebulae were actually distant \\"island universes\\" consisting of many stellar systems. The shape of our own galaxy was expected to resemble such \\"islands universes.\\" But \\"scientific arguments were marshalled against such a possibility,\\" and this view was rejected by almost all scientists until Edwin Hubble's measurements in 1924. William Herschel's model of the Milky Way, 1785 In 1783, amateur astronomer William Herschel attempted to determine the shape of the galaxy by examining stars through his handmade telescopes. Herschel was the first to propose a model of the galaxy based on observation and measurement. He concluded that it was in the shape of a disk, but incorrectly assumed that the sun was in the center of the disk. Seeing that the stars belonging to the Milky Way galaxy appeared to encircle the Earth, Herschel carefully counted stars of given apparent magnitudes, and after finding the numbers were the same in all directions, concluded Earth must be close to the center of the galaxy. However, there were two flaws in Herschel's methodology: magnitude is not a reliable index to the distance of stars, and some of the areas that he mistook for empty space were actually dark, obscuring nebulae that blocked his view toward the center of the Milky Way. The Herschel model remained relatively unchallenged for the next hundred years, with minor refinements. Jacobus Kapteyn introduced motion, density, and luminosity to Herschel's star counts, which still implied a near-central location of the Sun. Harlow Shapley and Galactocentrism In 1918, as Kapteyn was refining his model, Herschel's heliocentric theory was overthrown by astronomer Harlow Shapley's work on globular clusters. Shapley's observational cosmology marked a transition from Heliocentrism to Galactocentrism. Shapley had been studying the asymmetrical distribution of globular clusters, estimating the distance and location of individual objects by using variable stars as standard candles. Globular clusters contain many cepheid variable stars, whose precise relationship between luminosity and variability period was established by Henrietta Leavitt in 1908. Using cepheid and RR Lyrae variables to systematically chart the distribution of globular clusters, Shapley discovered that the stars in the Milky Way orbited a common center thousands of light years away from the Sun. The galactic center was determined to be in the direction of the Sagittarius constellation, approximately 50,000 light-years from us. Sextans A, a member of the local group of galaxies, which includes the Andromeda and Milky Way spirals, Lowell Observatory, 2013 In 1920 Heber Doust Curtis and Harlow Shapley participated in the Great Debate on the nature of nebulae and galaxies, and the size of the universe. Shapley believed that distant nebulae were relatively small and lay within the Milky Way galaxy. Curtis advocated the now-accepted view that nebulae were farther away, and that other galaxies apart from the Milky Way therefore existed. By 1925, Edwin Hubble had confirmed that many objects previously thought to be clouds of dust and gas and classified as \\"nebulae\\" were actually galaxies beyond the Milky Way. When astronomers realized that starlight can be absorbed by clouds of gas and dust, infrared radiation was used to penetrate the dust clouds. Estimates dating after 2000 locate the Solar System within the range from the Galactic Center of the Milky Way galaxy.

The target of the CAP is long term development, whereas the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), started in 2006, targets sudden onset humanitarian crisis such as natural disasters. The 2011 CAP seeks USD 7.4 billion to help 50 million people in 28 countries. The 2006 CAP was covered by the donor community to 63%. Structure As of 2006 the CAP is divided into ‚Äòclusters‚Äô, representing the various groups of implementing agencies in humanitarian aid.

It is based on the story of Sadako Sasaki. The book has been translated into many languages and published in many places, to be used for peace education programs in Primary schools. Plot overview After being diagnosed with leukemia from radiation caused by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Sadako's friend told her to fold origami paper cranes (orizuru) in hope of making a thousand of them. She was inspired to do so by the Japanese legend that one who created a thousand origami cranes would be granted a wish. Her wish was simply to live through her disease so she could fulfill her dream of being in running team. In this retelling of her story, she managed to fold only 644 cranes before she became too restless to fold any more, and died on the morning of October 25, 1955, knowing her family will always be there. Her friends and family helped finish her dream by folding the rest of the cranes, which were buried with Sadako. However, the claim in the book that Sadako \\"died before completing the 10,000 cranes, and her two friends completed the task, placing the finished cranes in her casket\\" is not backed up by her surviving family members. According to her family, and especially her older brother Masahiro Sasaki, who speaks on his sister's life at events, Sadako not only exceeded 644 cranes, she exceeded her goal of 1,000 and died having folded approximately 1,400 paper cranes. In his book, The Complete Story of Sadako Sasaki, co-written with Sue DiCicco, founder of the Peace Crane Project, Masahiro says Sadako exceeded her goal. Mr. Sasaki and the family have donated some of Sadako's cranes at places of importance around the world: in NYC at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum on November 19, 2015, at Museum of Tolerance on May 26, 2016, and the Japanese American National Museum three days later. USS Arizona Memorial Crane Donation and President Truman Museum Donation helped by Clifton Truman Daniel, who is the grandson of President Truman. After her death, Sadako's friends and schoolmates published a collection of letters in order to build a memorial to her and all of the children who had died from the effects of the atomic bomb. In 1999, a statue of Sadako holding a ruby crane was unveiled in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, also called the Genbaku Dome, and installed in the Hiroshima Peace Park. At the foot of the statue is a plaque that reads: \\"This is our cry. This is our prayer. Peace on Earth.\\" Every year on Obon Day, which is a holiday in Japan to remember the departed spirits of one's ancestors, thousands of people leave paper cranes near the statue. A paper crane database has been established online for contributors to leave a message of peace and to keep a record of those who have donated cranes. Related works In addition to Eleanor Coerr's story first published in 1977, Sadako's story has become familiar to many school children around the world through the novels The Day of the Bomb (1961, in German, Sadako will leben) by the Austrian writer Karl Bruckner. Sadako is also briefly mentioned in Children of the Ashes, Robert Jungk's historical account of the lives of Hiroshima victims and survivors and about Japan World War II. Masahiro Sasaki, Sadako's older brother, co-wrote The Complete Story of Sadako Sasaki with The Peace Crane Project founder Sue DiCicco in 2018, bringing what he feels is Sadako's complete story to the English speaking world for the first time. The book contains many family photos and new illustrations never before seen by the public. Masahiro also wrote 'Sadako's One Thousand Paper Cranes', published in Japanese in 2013. \\"Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes\\", a movie by Director George Levenson and based on the book by Eleanor Coerr (book), and written by George Levenson, starring Liv Ullmann as narrator was released in 1991. Evolving Pictures Entertainment is producing a motion picture tentatively entitled Sadako and the Magic of Paper Cranes, focuses on a true story written by three-time Academy Award winning producer, director, documentarian Malcolm Clarke about chronicling a group of fifth grade students from Albuquerque, New Mexico when inspired by their teacher, make their dream of building a monument come true, to honor the legend and spirit of the young girl Sadako Sasaki. In 2019, a motion picture titled One Thousand Paper Cranes was announced to begin production with Evan Rachel Wood playing Eleanor Coerr, telling the story of Coerr and Sadako and \\"how their lives are intricately connected.\\" There is also a statue of Sadako in the Seattle Peace Park. In addition, Sadako's story was dramatized at the opening ceremony of the Goodwill Games 1990 in Seattle when, to Ellie Rabb's narration of Sadako's story, some 400 local schoolchildren handed out some 20,000 origami paper cranes to the opening day crowd, thereby honoring the memory of Sadako and spreading her unfulfilled dream for world peace. The Seattle souvenir cranes were supposedly crafted from an original 1,000 pieces sent over by children from Japan.From viewing actual footage of the 1990 ceremony. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ukr8hZWH4E#t=0 Sadako has become a leading symbol of peace that is taught in Japanese schools on the anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing. In dedication to her, people all over the world celebrate August 6, as the annual Peace Day. In November 2015, Miyuki Sohara made \\"Orizuru 2015\\", an educational short film for children. This film is a friendship story and made with Los Angeles School kids, Hollywood actors and crews. Sadako's nephew appears in film and sings a song about Sadako's life, \\"Inori\\". This film was selected by Hiroshima International Film Festival in 2015 and afterward was released in Los Angeles on May 27, 2016, at its US premiere screening. This date coincided with President Obama's visit to Hiroshima with a gift for four paper cranes. At the same time, Miyuki Sohara coordinated Sadako's two crane donations to the Museum of Tolerance and the Japanese American National Museum. She also coordinated a lecture promoting peace with Sasaki and Clifton Truman Daniel, grandson of President Truman, to several schools in Southern California. Laurie Rubin and Jenny Taira, Co- founders and Artistic Directors of Ohana Arts, a children's theater and arts organization based in Honolulu, Hawai'i, have written a musical for youth performers called \\"Peace on Your Wings\\", based on the life of Sadako Sasaki and her message of hope and peace for the world. The musical has been performed across the United States and has the support and approval of members of Sadako's surviving family. The Bell Shakespeare theatre company in Sydney, Australia mounted a production of Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes during its 1997 season. The album Wanderer by the death metal/metalcore band Heaven Shall Burn features a song called \\"Passage of the Crane\\" dedicated to her story, as does \\"Sadako's Wings of Hope\\" on Niobeth's album Silvery Moonbeams.

Formation By law, Kansas' educational standards require periodic revision. In 1999, a revision was scheduled for the state science standards. The state board chose a committee of approximately 25 expert Kansans, including science educators and businesspeople, to rewrite the standards completely. Although the committee did its work well, Creationists began attending the hearings of the science committee of the state board and toured the state giving presentations critical of the evolution in the draft science standards. At the same time, a local Lawrence, Kansas group called POSH (Parents for Objective Science and History) began lobbying the local school board for creationist changes to the Lawrence curriculum. Despite the work of the committee, toward the end of the process, the creationists on the state board ‚Äì who were primarily Young Earth Creationists - attempted to influence the standards. At that point, the board was split 5 to 5 on many issues. Led by Steve Abrams, then board president, the creationists collaborated with the Creation Science Association of Mid America to change the committee's recommendations, removing significant references to evolution and replacing material with creationist perspectives. They were able to convince one state board member to switch sides and vote in favor of the creationist science standards. Reactions included recruiting those who wrote pro-science letters to newspapers in order to generate a core group of activists. Although these activists originally met to coordinate testimony before board meetings, a week prior to the actual BOE vote over the standards, KCFS was incorporated on 8 August 1999. Holding a media conference on the steps of the Kansas Museum of Natural History the next day, they pledged to combat the anti-science activities of the board. Two days later, on 11 August 1999, the Kansas State Board of Education voted 6‚Äì4 to approve creation science-friendly standards that minimized teaching the theories of evolution, the Big Bang, and geological time. Although they did not outlaw the teaching of evolution, they did open the standards to local control, prompting several communities, including Pratt, Kansas, to adopt overtly creationist standards. KCFS recruited participants from across the state and led the fight to correct the standards the creationists had passed. They formed relationships with educational and scientific organizations both across Kansas and throughout the US. At the next election, Kansas voters replaced the creationists with a pro- science majority and within a few months, the standards recommended by the expert committee were passed, replacing the creationist standards that de- emphasized evolution. The National Citizens for Science Movement The method whereby KCFS organized was noted by national pro-science organizations. The attacks on evolution are nationwide and prominent members of the pro- science community are pushing for nationwide duplication of the KCFS method. One result was the Citizens for Science movement, which seeks to promote communication and cooperation between KCFS-like entities in each state.

The event is held annually encouraging individuals, communities, and businesses to turn off non-essential electric lights, for one hour, from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. on a specific day towards the end of March, as a symbol of commitment to the planet. It was started as a lights-off event in Sydney, Australia, in 2007. Since then, it has grown to engage more than 7,000 cities and towns across 187 countries and territories to raise awareness for energy consumption and effects on the environment. Occasionally, in years when Holy Saturday falls on the last Saturday of March, Earth Hour is moved a week early rather than its usual date. Earth Hour 2020 was held on March 28, from 8:30 pm to 9:30 pm: https://www.earthhour.org/ History=Conception and start: 2004‚Äì2007= In 2004, confronted with scientific findings, WWF Australia met with advertising agency Leo Burnett Sydney to \\"discuss ideas for engaging Australians on the issue of climate change\\". The idea of a large scale switch off was coined and developed in 2006, originally under the working title \\"The Big Flick\\". WWF Australia presented their concept to Fairfax Media who, along with Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, agreed to back the event. The 2007 Earth Hour was held on March 31 in Sydney, Australia at 7:30 pm, local time. In October 2007 San Francisco ran its own \\"Lights Out\\" program inspired by the Sydney Earth Hour. After their successful event in October, the organizers decided to rally behind the Earth Hour being planned for March 2008. =2008= Overview of Sydney during Earth Hour 2008 Earth Hour 2008 was held internationally on March 29, 2008 from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. local time, marking the first anniversary of the event. 35 countries around the world participated as official flagship cities and over 400 cities also supported. Landmarks around the world turned off their non-essential lighting for Earth Hour. Some websites took part in the event, with Google's homepage going \\"dark\\" on the day . According to a Zogby International online survey, 36 million Americans‚Äîapproximately 16 percent of the United States adult population‚Äîparticipated in Earth Hour 2008. The survey also showed there was a 4 percentage point increase in the level of interest in environmental issues such as climate change and pollution directly after the event (73 percent pre- event versus 77 percent post-event). Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House were darkened during Earth Hour 2007. Tel Aviv scheduled their Earth Hour for Thursday March 27, 2008 to avoid conflict with Sabbath. Dublin moved their Earth Hour to between 9 and 10 p.m. due to their northern geographical location. Azrieli Center in Tel Aviv darkened for Earth Hour 2010. Colosseum darkened for Earth Hour 2008 Auditorio de Tenerife darkened for Earth Hour According to WWF Thailand, Bangkok decreased electricity usage by 73.34 megawatts, which, over one hour, is equivalent to 41.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide. The Bangkok Post gave different figures of 165 megawatt-hours and 102 tonnes of carbon dioxide. This was noted to be significantly less than a similar campaign initiated by Bangkok's City Hall the previous year in May, when 530 megawatt-hours were saved and 143 tonnes of carbon dioxide emission were cut. Philippine Electricity Market Corp. noted that power consumption dropped by about 78.63 megawatts in Metro Manila, and up to 102.2 megawatts on Luzon. The maximum demand drop of around 39 MW was experienced at 8:14 p.m. in Metro Manila and of around 116 MW at 8:34 p.m. in the Luzon grid. Ontario used approximately 900 megawatt-hours less electrical energy during Earth Hour. At one point, Toronto saw an 8.7% reduction in consumption as compared to a typical March Saturday night. Ireland, as a whole, had a reduction in electricity use of about 1.5% for the evening. In the three-hour period between 6:30 p.m. and 9:30 pm, there was a reduction of 50 megawatts, saving 150 megawatt-hours, or approximately 60 tonnes of carbon dioxide. In Dubai, where external lighting on several major city landmarks was turned off and street lighting in selected areas was dimmed by 50%, the Electricity and Water Authority reported savings of 100 megawatt-hours of electricity. This represented a 2.4% reduction in demand compared to before the hour began. Sky Tower in Auckland, New Zealand, switched off its usual floodlighting during the Earth Hour, and re-lit afterwards. (the red lights in the middle image are aircraft warning lights) The best result was from Christchurch, New Zealand, with the city reporting a drop of 13% in electricity demand. However, national grid operator Transpower reported that New Zealand's power consumption during Earth Hour was 335 megawatts, higher than the 328 megawatt average of the previous two Saturdays.Lights on, power use up for Earth Hour. Kelly Andrew. The Dominion Post. Monday, March 31, 2008. Melbourne, Australia reduced demand by 10.1%. Sydney, being the city that participated in both the 2007 and 2008 Earth Hours, cut electricity consumption by 8.4%. This is less than the previous year's 10.2%; however, Earth Hour executive director Andy Ridley made the claim that after factoring margin of error, the participation in this city was the same. The worst result was from Calgary, Canada. The city's power consumption actually went up 3.6% at the hour's peak electricity demand. Calgary's weather plays a large role in power consumption, and the city experienced weather 12 ¬∞C (around 22 ¬∞F) colder than the previous Saturday's recorded temperature in the inaugural year. Enmax, the city's power supplier, has confirmed that in all subsequent years, Calgarians have not supported the Earth Hour initiative, noting that power consumption changed only marginally during the hour in 2010 and 2011 (1% or less) and in 2012 and 2013 showed no appreciable change in power usage at all. =2009= Earth Hour 2009 was from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. local time, March 28, 2009. The campaign was titled \\"Vote Earth\\" and was dubbed \\"the world's first global vote\\" with one billion votes was the stated aim for Earth Hour 2009, in the context of the pivotal 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference. WWF reported that 88 countries and 4,159 cities participated in Earth Hour 2009, ten times more cities than Earth Hour 2008 had (2008 saw 400 cities participate). Among the participants in 2009 was, for the first time, the United Nations Headquarters in New York City. In Egypt, the lights went out on the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids of Giza from 8:30 to 9:30 pm. The Philippines saw participation from 647 cities and towns; over 10 million Filipinos were estimated to have joined in the hour-long lights-off. This was followed by Greece with 484 cities and towns participating, and Australia with 309. Despite official organizers WWF stating that the event is not about the reduction in electricity, a number of public institutions reported on electricity savings in their cities to see participation numbers. The Canadian province of Ontario, excluding the city of Toronto, saw a decrease of 6% in electricity usage while Toronto saw a decrease of 15.1% (nearly doubled from 8.7% the previous year) as many businesses darkened, including the landmark CN Tower. The Philippines was able to save 611 MWh of electricity during the time period, which is said to be equivalent to shutting down a dozen coal-fired power plants for an hour. Swedish electricity operator Svenska Kraftn√§t recorded a 2.1% decrease in power consumption from its projected figure between 8 p.m. and 9 pm. The following hour, the corresponding number was 5%. This is equivalent to the consumption of approximately half a million households out of the total 4.5 million households in Sweden. According to the National Power Dispatch Centre, Vietnam's electricity demand fell 140 MWh during Earth Hour. =2010= The metal structure of the greenhouses of the curitiban Botanic Garden (Curitiba, Paran√°, Southern Brazil), with its lights off on March 27, 2010 Earth Hour 2010 was held from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. local time on March 27. In Israel, the hour was held on April 22. 126 countries participated in Earth Hour 2010. In the United States polling showed that an estimated 90,000,000 Americans participated in Earth Hour as lights were turned off around the country, including landmarks such as Mount Rushmore, the Las Vegas Strip, the Empire State Building and Niagara Falls. Some cities and landmarks took the opportunity to make more long-term adjustments to their everyday power consumption. In Chicago, the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) developed lighting guidelines to reduce light pollution and reduce the carbon footprint of downtown buildings. Mount Rushmore in South Dakota started powering down each night around 9 p.m. instead of 11 p.m. In Vietnam, electricity demand fell 500,000 kWh during Earth Hour 2010, which was three times larger than the first time the country joined the event in 2009. In the Philippines, 1,067 towns and cities pledged participation in 2010 and over 15 million Filipinos participated in the event. About 4000 cities participated, including landmarks such as Big Ben, the Empire State Building, the Sydney Opera House, the Eiffel Tower, the Parthenon, the Brandenburg Gate, and the Forbidden City.Alastair Jamieson (March 27, 2010).

Retrieved April 6, 2009. =2011= Earth Hour 2011 was the biggest year in the campaign's five- year history, reaffirming it as the largest ever voluntary action for the environment. In 2011, the tagline \\"Beyond the Hour\\" was adopted by organizers as a way to encourage people to take their commitment to the cause beyond the 60-minute event. Together with agency Leo Burnett, Earth Hour unveiled an updated planet themed logo that included a small plus symbol to the right of the signature \\"60\\" which was used in previous years. The 60+ symbol continues to be the main logo used by campaign organizers around the world. Earth Hour 2011 took place in a record 5,251 cities and towns in 135 countries and territories on all seven continents. It had an estimated reach of 1.8 billion people across the globe. In addition to this, the campaign's digital footprint grew to 91 million. In India, Earth Hour 2011 was held on March 26, 2011 from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 pm.

Rosebowl channel suspended broadcasting from 8.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. to mark the observance of Earth Hour. In Azerbaijan, Maiden Tower darkened for Earth Hour. The Philippines, which has been an active participant of the Earth Hour, had an early \\"earth hour\\" when power was accidentally interrupted, plunging Metro Manila and nearby provinces into darkness. After power was restored, major buildings, commercial centers and residential areas in Metro Manila and most provinces continued to turn off their lights, while participating channels in the Philippines, ABS-CBN and Cartoon Network halted their transmissions for an hour. 30 provinces and cities in Vietnam took part in Earth Hour 2011 with the main event held in Nha Trang. The nation's electricity demand fell 400,000 kWh, one-fifth less than the previous year's. Vietnam managed to save 500 million VND (US$23,809) thanks to the saved power. YouTube promoted the Earth Hour by changing its logo, and by adding a switch on/off feature near the title of each video, so that users could change the background colour from white to black. One of the least co-operative areas traditionally has been Alberta; in 2008, Calgary's power consumption went up during Earth Hour. The trend continued in 2011 when Edmonton's power usage also increased. While Calgary's power usage went down in 2011 during the event, electricity officials could not distinguish their readings between normal usage and a conscious attempt to participate. =2012= Earth Hour Global headquarters was moving from Sydney to Singapore in February 2012. A launch event took place at ION Orchard on February 20, with the move supported by Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB) and WWF-Singapore. Earth Hour 2012 was observed on March 31, 2012, from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. (participants' local time). It took place in more than 7000 cities and towns across 152 countries and territories, making it the biggest growth year for the campaign since 2009. It was also the first year that Earth Hour was celebrated in space, with Dutch astronaut Andr√© Kuipers tweeting at various moments during the event's trek around the globe. =2013= Italy, Verona, Arena with backlight off on square Bra, in the bottom Town Hall during Earth Hour 2013 Earth Hour 2013 was held across the world on Saturday, March 23 at 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. local time to avoid taking place after European Summer Time began, ensuring a greater impact for the lights-off event. It was also changed to avoid coinciding with the Christian Holy Saturday, which fell on March 30 of that year. Africa In 2013, the world's first Earth Hour Forest began in Uganda, an ongoing project that aims to restore 2700 hectares of degraded land. Standard Chartered Bank-Uganda pledged to help fill the forest with more than 250,000 trees. Earth Hour commemorations in Madagascar had as their highlight the distribution of one thousand wood-saving stoves to victims of the cyclone Haruna in the southern town of Toliara, extensively damaged in the February 22 storm. WWF-Madagascar and ADES (Association pour le D√©veloppement de l'Energie Solaire) distributed an additional 2,200 wood-saving stoves later that year. Former President of Botswana, Festus Mogae promised to plant one million indigenous trees over four years, as part of his \\"I Will If You Will\\" challenge for Earth 2013. Europe WWF-Russia launched its 2013 campaign aiming to secure more than 100,000 signatures from Russian citizens to petition for amendments to the current forest legislation. The petition reached more than 127,000 signatures before the Earth Hour event, ensuring the legislation was debated in the State Duma by politicians. =2014= Earth Hour 2014 took place on Saturday, March 29, during the same 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. local timeslot. Earth Hour Blue was launched as a global crowdfunding and crowdsourcing platform for the planet. \\"It is all about the collective effort of individuals around the world getting together to help fund or add their voice to support on-the-ground environmental and social projects that deliver real outcomes.\\" The Earth Hour 2014 Report highlighted a broad range of environmental outcomes achieved by the movement across 162 countries and territories around the world. More than US$60,000 was raised on the Earth Hour Blue platform for grassroots environmental projects run by WWF. The movement also saw campaigns to help protect Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the launch of a Blue Sky App in China, and the delivery of thousands of wood efficient stoves to communities in Madagascar. =2015= Earth Hour 2015 took place on Saturday, March 28, again between 8:30 and 9:30 p.m. local time.Celebrating Earth Hour Earth Hour/WWF Website The tagline for the global campaign was \\"Change Climate Change\\", returning to the movement's original focus to initiate citizen action on global warming. A day before the event, over 170 countries and territories had confirmed their participation; with more than 1200 landmarks and close to 40 UNESCO world heritage sites set for the switch off. For the second year running, Earth Hour Blue aims to raise funds for WWF organized climate focused projects on a crowdfunding platform. This year, crowdfunding projects include solar light distribution in the Philippines and India, and wildlife based projects from Colombia, Uganda and Indonesia. Uniquely participating in the Earth Hour activity are the inhabitants of an island called Sibuyan in the Philippines who turned on their lights to elevate the message of using renewable energy. The island's source of electricity is a mini-hydro power plant. =2016= Earth Hour 2016 was on Saturday, March 19, from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. during participants' local time.

Measurement of reduction in electricity use The Earth Hour Global FAQ page states: A 2014 study published in Energy Research and Social Science compiled 274 measurements of observed changes in electricity demand caused by Earth Hour in 10 countries, spanning 6 years, and found that the events reduced electricity consumption an average of 4%. The study noted the policy challenge of converting Earth Hour's short-term energy saving into longer-term actions, including sustained changes in behaviour and investment. Criticism Bj√∏rn Lomborg, author of The Skeptical Environmentalist, wrote, \\"It is vital to make solar and other new technology cheaper than fossil fuels quickly so we can turn off carbon energy sources for a lot longer than one hour and keep the planet running... Fossil fuels literally gave us an enlightenment, by lighting our world and giving us protection from the fury of the elements. It is ironic that today's pure symbolism should hark back to a darker age.\\" Lomborg also pointed out the feel-good factor Earth Hour creates, noting that it is an \\"ineffective feel good event\\" that makes people feel they are doing something for the environment, while in reality the amount of carbon emissions reduced by the earth hour is negligible. Other criticisms of Earth Hour have included the following: * Some critics point out that the reduction in power consumption during Earth Hour itself is relatively insignificant. The Herald Sun equated the power savings in the Sydney central business district to \\"taking 48,613 cars off the road for 1 hour\\". Australian columnist Andrew Bolt pointed out that \\"A cut so tiny is trivial ‚Äì equal to taking six cars off the road for a year\\".Bolt, Andrew (March 28, 2008). \\"Earth Hour coverage should be grounded\\", Herald Sun, Retrieved March 20, 2011 *Other environmentalists have criticized Earth Hour's focus on individual behaviour, when a small number of fossil fuel companies have emitted the vast majority of man-made carbon emissions. Adam McGibbon, writing for The Independent, criticized Earth Hour for releasing fossil fuel companies and politicians from their responsibility to deal with climate change. * The Christian Science Monitor said that most candles are made from paraffin, a heavy hydrocarbon derived from crude oil, a fossil fuel, and that depending on how many candles a person burns (if one uses candles during Earth Hour), whether or not they normally use compact fluorescent light bulbs, and what source of energy is used to produce their electricity, in some cases, replacing light bulbs with candles will cause an increase, instead of a decrease, in carbon dioxide emissions.Does lighting candles for Earth Hour defeat the purpose?, Christian Science Monitor, March 27, 2009 * On March 29, 2009, one day after Earth Hour 2009, D√¢n Tr√≠ Daily News published an editorial expressing concern that many young people chose to drive around the darkened city of Hanoi for fun, exhausting petroleum instead of electricity and resulting in long traffic jams.\\"C√°i nh√¨n kh√°c trong Gi·ªù Tr√°i ƒë·∫•t\\", D√¢n Tr√≠ Daily News, by C∆∞·ªùng Cao, date: March 29, 2009. *George Marshall of the Climate Outreach Information Network criticized Earth Hour for \\"playing into the hands of (the critics of environmentalists),\\" as darkness is symbolic of fear and decay. \\"The overwhelming need at the moment is to inspire ordinary people with a vision of a better world, to make them feel that action on climate change is utterly desirable and positive.... the cultural resonance (of Earth Hour) couldn't be any worse.\\" *The Competitive Enterprise Institute has introduced an opposing Human Achievement Hour in celebration of human progress in various fields of industry, including technology, medicine, energy, and more. During this hour, the Institute suggests that people celebrate by using modern technology such as electricity, telecommunications and indoor plumbing. * In 2009, economist Ross McKitrick criticized the idea, saying, \\"Abundant, cheap electricity has been the greatest source of human liberation in the 20th century.[...] The whole mentality around Earth Hour demonizes electricity.\\" * In March 2010, The Daily Telegraph quoted Ross Hayman, head of media relations at the UK National Grid, as saying \\"it could therefore result in an increase in carbon emissions\\" due to complications related to rapidly lowering then raising electricity generation. * In February 2010, Rick Giles, president of ACT on Campus, the youth wing of New Zealand's ACT Party, appeared on the morning television show Sunrise to denounce Earth Hour and instead suggested the celebration of \\"Edison Hour\\". He argued that Earth Hour is an \\"anti-technology\\" cause, and that people will simply use candles instead, which is undesirable as they are petroleum-based. He argued that if we are heading for some kind of disaster, it makes sense to use technology to combat this. Rick said \\"I think my argument is so powerful that it's not necessary to talk about it\\". * The Ayn Rand Institute wrote, \\"Participants spend an enjoyable sixty minutes in the dark, safe in the knowledge that the life-saving benefits of industrial civilization are just a light switch away... Forget one measly hour with just the lights off. How about Earth Month... Try spending a month shivering in the dark without heating, electricity, refrigeration; without power plants or generators; without any of the labor-saving, time-saving, and therefore life- saving products that industrial energy makes possible.\\"The Real Meaning of Earth Hour, by Keith Lockitch, Ayn Rand Institute, March 23, 2009 * Expressing sarcastic support for Earth Hour, the pro-carbon Carbon Sense Coalition wants Earth Hour to be renamed \\"Blackout Night\\", and to be held outside on the shortest and coldest day of the year \\"...to prepare our population for the dark days ahead\\". * During the 2010 Earth Hour in the city of Uusikaupunki in Finland, a 17-year-old female motorcyclist hit a 71-year-old man, who was walking on the street instead of the sidewalk for an unknown reason. The man died from his injuries, while the motorcyclist and her passenger were uninjured. At the time of the accident the street lights had been turned off as part of the Earth Hour. The police stated that the lack of street lighting may have played a part in the accident, while the mayor believed the city's street lights would have been too dim to prevent it even if they had been on. * Jeremy Clarkson, ex-host of the BBC motoring programme Top Gear, claimed switching on all electrical items in his home as a protest against the perceived impact of Earth Hour, claiming the event would have little to no effect on attitudes towards climate change.

Plot James, a young man starting with a large London firm of estate agents and auctioneers, is ambitious to get to the top. In a cheap caf√©, he meets Charles, a drunken layabout who has everything James wants: effortless upper-class arrogance and impeccable tailoring. In return for a room to live in and loans for drink and betting, Charles agrees to tutor James in the life skills he thinks he needs to succeed. By bluff and sabotage, James rises in his firm, catching the eye of the owner and of his only daughter Ann. Disaster threatens when Charles has a big win and wants to end the deal. James hastily strangles him and his landlady agrees to hide the corpse in her cellar in return for continuing their sexual liaison. After a long courtship, Ann agrees to marry James and her father makes him a partner in the business. Having conveniently sent his lower-middle-class parents to Australia, James anticipates his success being crowned by a grand society wedding. Ann's father confesses that he has a totally disreputable son they never see called Charles and developers who have bought the house of James' former landlady find a corpse in the cellar.

Orthopaedic surgeons are medically qualified, having been through four years of college, followed by 4 years of medical school to obtain an M.D. or D.O. followed by specialist training as a resident in orthopaedics, and only then do they sub-specialise in foot and ankle surgery. Training for a podiatric foot and ankle surgeon consists of four years of college, four years of podiatric medical school (D.P.M.), 3‚Äì4 years of a surgical residency and an optional 1 year fellowship. The distinction between a podiatric and orthopedic foot and ankle surgeon is important: an orthopedic surgeon has a Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine medical degree and training that encompasses both orthopedic residency and an optional 6-month to one year of fellowship training specific in techniques of foot and ankle surgery, while the training of a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine consist of a podiatric medical degree and three to four-year residency training specific to foot and ankle medicine and surgery, with an optional additional 1-year fellowship in foot and ankle trauma, reconstruction, or diabetic limb salvage. In the UK much controversy exists on the scope of podiatrists practicing surgery and the British Orthopaedic Association, and the British Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society produced a position statement on the importance of training and ongoing regulation of podiatrists practising podiatric forefoot surgery after certification and recommended that this should be to the same standard as that of medically qualified trauma and orthopaedic surgeons operating on the foot and ankle.  Clinical scope  Foot and ankle surgeons are trained to treat all disorders of the foot and ankle, both surgical and non-surgical. Additionally, the surgeons are also trained to understand the complex connections between disorders and deformities of the foot, ankle, knee, hip, and the spine. Therefore, the surgeon will typically see cases that vary from trauma (such as malleolar fractures, tibial pilon fractures, calcaneus fractures, navicular and midfoot injuries and metatarsal and phalangeal fractures.) Arthritis care (primarily surgical) of the ankle joint and the joints of the hindfoot (tarsals), midfoot (metatarsals) and forefoot (phalanges) also plays a rather significant role. Congenital and acquired deformities include adult acquired flatfoot, non-neuromuscular foot deformity, diabetic foot disorders, hallux valgus and several common pediatric foot and ankle conditions (such as clubfoot, flat feet, tarsal coalitions, etc.) Patients may also be referred to a foot and ankle surgeon for proper diagnosis and treatment of heel pain (such as a consequence from plantar heel fasciitis), nerve disorders (such as tarsal tunnel syndrome) and tumors of the foot and ankle. Amputation and ankle arthroscopy (the use of a laparoscope in foot and ankle surgical procedures) have emerged as prominent tools in foot and ankle care. In addition, more applications for laser surgery are being found in the treatment of foot and ankle disorders, including treatment for bunions and soft tissue lesions. A patient may also be referred to a foot and ankle surgeon for the surgical care of nail problems and phalangeal deformities (such as bunions and bunionettes.)  Non-surgical treatments  The vast majority of foot and ankle conditions do not require surgical intervention. For example, several phalangeal conditions may be traced to the type of foot box used in a shoe, and a change of a shoe or shoe box may be sufficient to treat the condition. For inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS) may be used to manage or slow down the process. Orthotics, or an externally applied device used to modify the structural or functional characteristics of the neuromusculoskeletal system specifically for the foot and ankle, may be used as inserts into shoes to displace regions of the foot for more balanced, comfortable or therapeutic placements of the foot. Physical therapy may also be used to alleviate symptoms, strengthening muscles such as the gastrocnemius muscle (which in turn will pull on the heel, which will then pull on the plantar fascia, thus changing the structure and shape of the foot).  Surgical treatments  Anterior and lateral view x-rays of fractured left leg with internal fixation after surgery Surgery is considered to be a last option when more conservative approaches fail to alleviate symptoms. Techniques such as bunionectomies may be used to surgically remove bunions and other foot and ankle deformalities, arthrodesis (or fusion of joint spaces) for inflammatory processes, and surgical reconstruction (i.e. invasive measures of manipulating neuromusculoskeletal structures) to treat other deformalities. Orthotics, physical therapy, NSAIDs, DMARDs and a change of shoe may act as a complement to surgical intervention, and in most cases will be required for optimal recovery.  Publications  The last 50 years has shown high quality research into the etiology and management of foot and ankle deformities. Several publications have been made to act as forums for such research: * Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association - a peer reviewed indexed medical journal *The Journal of Foot & Ankle Surgery - a surgical journal operated by the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons *Foot and Ankle International - a surgical journal operated by the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS). *Techniques in Foot & Ankle Surgery * The Foot & Ankle Journal - The Foot & Ankle Journal the first open access journal for podiatry and foot & ankle orthopaedics.

Upon completion in 1869, she was the fastest warship in the world and was assigned to the Channel Squadron. Two years later the ship was transferred to the Detached Squadron for a brief time before she was paid off into reserve in 1872. Inconstant was recommissioned in 1880 for service with the Flying Squadron that circumnavigated the world in 1880‚Äì82. On the return voyage, the ship was diverted to Egypt during the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882 and played a minor role supporting operations ashore. She was reduced to reserve again after her return and was served as an accommodation ship in 1897. Inconstant was hulked in 1904 and became a training ship in 1906. She continued in that role, under a variety of names, until she was sold for scrap in 1955 and subsequently broken up, the second-to-last surviving Pembroke-built warship in existence. Design and description Inconstant was the first of an intended six fast, unarmoured, iron-hulled, frigates designed by the British Admiralty's Chief Constructor, Sir Edward Reed, in response to the fast, wooden American Wampanoag-class frigates. Only three were built, however, as the American ships proved to be flawed enough to pose no real threat and the British ships were very expensive.Gardiner, p. 89 The ship was long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a draught of . Inconstant displaced Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 47 and had a tonnage of 4,066 tons burthen. She carried a complement of 600 officers and ratings.Winfield & Lyon, p. 265 To reduce biofouling, her iron hull was sheathed in two layers of oak thick that was covered by a layer of copper. Inconstant was a good seaboat and a steady gun platform.Ballard, pp. 42‚Äì43 The ship had a single John Penn and Sons two-cylinder trunk steam engine that drove a propeller. The engine used steam provided by 11 boilers with a working pressure of .Ballard, p. 44 Inconstant reached a speed of from during her sea trials and was the fastest warship afloat when completed. The ship once sustained an average speed of for 24 hours.Phillips, p. 190 She carried a maximum of of coal, enough to steam at . Inconstant was ship-rigged with three masts and a sail area of . She proved to be excellent under sail, reaching a maximum speed of , one of only two warships ever to reach this speed under sail and 16 knots with steam.Ballard, pp. 44‚Äì45 To improve her performance under sail, her propeller could be hoisted into the hull and her funnels lowered to reduce drag. When completed the ship was more heavily armed than all but two of the twenty-four British ironclads afloat. Inconstants main armament consisted of ten rifled muzzle- loading (RML) guns on the main deck in the traditional broadside layout. The 9-inch shells weighed and was rated with the ability to penetrate of wrought- iron armour.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 6 Her secondary armament of six RML guns was mounted on the upper deck, with two guns positioned in the bow as chase guns. The guns fired a shell that could pierce of armour. Construction and career Inconstant in 1872 Inconstant, the fifth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy,Colledge, pp. 171‚Äì72 was laid down on 27 November 1866 at Pembroke Dockyard, Wales. The ship was launched on 25 March 1872 by Lady Muriel Campbell, daughter of John Campbell, 2nd Earl Cawdor. Inconstant was transferred to Portsmouth Dockyard to finish fitting out and was commissioned on 12 August 1869 by Captain Elphinstone D'Oyly D'Auvergne Aplin for duty with the Channel Squadron.Phillips, p. 191 He was relieved by Captain Charles Waddilove on 13 September 1870. The following year the ship was assigned to the Detached Squadron, commanded by Rear-Admiral Frederick Seymour, which visited ports in Scandinavia after Inconstant joined them at Gibraltar, finally arriving at Spithead on 11 October 1871. The ship was paid off in 1872 and spent the next eight years in reserve.Ballard, p. 46 She was recommissioned in 1880 and was commanded by Captain Lord Walter Kerr from 5 February to 11 March. During this time, Inconstant served as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Seymour of the Mediterranean Fleet as she ferried replacement crews to that fleet. From August 1880 to October 1882, Inconstant was assigned to the reconstituted Detached Squadron, this time as the flagship, first of Rear-Admiral Richard Meade, 4th Earl of Clanwilliam until he was got sick in Hong Kong, and then from 6 December 1881 to 17 October 1882 of Rear-Admiral Sir Francis Sullivan. Inconstants captain at this time was Captain Charles Penrose-Fitzgerald. The Detached Squadron left Spithead on 17 October 1880 to circumnavigate the world and returned two years later. It is claimed that on 11 July 1881 (or 11 June 1881), Prince George of Wales (later King George V of England) sighted a phantom ship whilst aboard Inconstant between Melbourne and Sydney. Two other ships, Tourmaline and Cleopatra, also reported seeing the phantom ship.Colby, p. 44 Just after arriving in the Falkand Islands, the squadron was ordered to Simonstown, South Africa, for possible service in the First Boer War of 1880‚Äì81, but hostilities had already ended by the time that it arrived. On the return voyage, the frigate caught fire; it was stopped by flooding all of the after compartments. Shortly afterward, the squadron was diverted to Egypt after the start of the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882; they arrived after the Bombardment of Alexandria on 11 July and some of Inconstants crew were landed to participate in operations ashore.Ballard, pp. 44, 47 The ship was reduced to reserve again after their return on 16 October 1882. She became an accommodation ship for the overflow from the barracks at Devonport in 1897.Phillips, p. 192 Inconstant was taken out of service in 1904 and became a gunnery training ship in June 1906, assigned to the boy's training establishment Impregnable.Ballard, p. 47 She was renamed Impregnable III in 1907, then Defiance IV in January 1922 after she was transferred to the torpedo training school at Plymouth, Defiance, and then Defiance II in December 1930. The ship was sold for scrap in September 1955 and arrived at the breaker's yard in Belgium on 4 April 1956 for demolition, when she was the second-to-last Welsh-built naval vessel afloat.

At the , Wangary had a population of 289. It is located in the cadastral Hundred of Lake Wangary. It surrounds the freshwater Lake Wangary. The government town of Wangary was surveyed in 1871 though never formally proclaimed. It was incorporated into the modern broader locality of Wangary when the boundaries of the latter were formalised in October 2003. The Old Lake Wangary Hotel was built in 1871, and is one of the main surviving structures in town; it has not had a liquor license since 1933, but remains open as a general store. The sports oval and ruins of the former post office (established 1862, closed 1976), coach house and bakery are located nearby. Lake Wangary Primary School, located on Third Street, has existed since 1933. Lake Wangary Cemetery, located on Snapper Hill Road, was first proclaimed in 1882 and used until the early 1900s, before being resurveyed as a modern cemetery in 1984. It is now maintained by the local council. There are nearby inselbergs called the Marble Range. They possess many unique lifeforms, some of which has been described scientifically. Colonial views of the Lake Wangary area were done in the 1840s by English Colonial Artist George French Angas.

Based on the book, Un Nazi en Manhattan, written by Fernando Josseau, Paul Dehn and James Bernard won the Academy Award for Best Story for this film. Plot In the early 1950s, the British Prime Minister (Ronald Adam) is sent a letter by Professor Willingdon (Barry Jones), who works at Britain's atomic weapons development facility, the (fictitious) Wallingford Research Centre, from which he has surreptitiously taken a nuclear warhead. It is a very explicit threat that Willingdon will destroy the centre of London in a week's time, at noon (hence the film title), unless the British government declares that it is to stop all stockpiling of nuclear warheads. Detective Superintendent Folland (Andr√© Morell) of Scotland Yard's Special Branch is charged with tracking down Willingdon and stopping him. Arriving at the Wallingford Research Centre (based on the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment {AWRE} at Aldermaston), Folland's team find Willingdon missing, along with a nuclear bomb. Willingdon's assistant Lane (Hugh Cross) is recruited to help and they return to London to search for him. Willingdon, carrying his bomb in a Gladstone bag, finds lodgings with Mrs Peckitt (Joan Hickson), but spooks her with his constant pacing around his room during the night. The following morning, he leaves early and, seeing a 'wanted' poster with his face, disguises himself with a new coat and having his moustache shaved off. Folland's team plan for the worst and get Cabinet approval to evacuate London. Rumours begin to fly that another war is about to be declared, and the Prime Minister agrees to do a radio broadcast to try to quash these, and appeal to Willingdon to give himself up. The next day, Willingdon's daughter Ann (Sheila Manahan) turns up at Folland's office to demand some answers. Folland tells her all, and asks her to stay and help ‚Äì she may be the only person the professor will listen to. Mrs Peckitt reports Willingdon to the police, thinking that he is a 'landlady murderer' reported in the paper, but a quick-thinking constable realises the description better matches Willingdon and a car is sent to check him. Unfortunately, Willingdon spots it on his way back to his lodgings and makes a quiet getaway. Driving back to their hotel from the police operations centre, Lane and Ann Willingdon spot the professor but fail to catch him. An updated description is quickly circulated. That evening Willingdon bumps into 'Mrs' \\"Goldie\\" Phillips (Olive Sloane); she invites him to buy her a drink, the two of them having met, by chance, earlier at a pawnbroker's. As he has no lodgings, Goldie offers him her \\"spare\\" bed for the night. By this time, London is being evacuated and Willingdon decides to lie low. The troops have begun to search and Goldie's bedsit seems a good place to remain hidden. Willingdon is forced to hold Goldie hostage, fearing that if he doesn't, she will inform the authorities of his location. The streets cleared, Willingdon makes his escape and finds his final refuge, a bomb blitzed church. The net steadily closes and Willingdon is finally found, praying. Lane, Ann and Folland arrive to try to talk the professor away from his bag. He panics, runs from the church, and is killed by an even more panicking soldier (Victor Maddern). With seconds to spare, Lane has the bomb defused.

Roy Boulting produced while John directed and Roy edited. The brothers described the story as \\"Guy Fawkes in modern dress\\" and deliberately did not cast any stars in the leads as they felt the story would be more believable that way. Filming started in July 1949, Location filming took place in London over several weeks including at Westminster Bridge, Lambeth Grove and Trafalgar Train Station. Traffic on the bridge was controlled by walkie talkies. Gilbert Taylor was influenced by the photography of The Naked City. During filming John Boulting said \\"\\"We don't want any stars. They would be a positive hindrance. Those old familiar faces, and old familiar tricks and gestures, would entirely destroy the illusion we have created. Only my brother and I know the full story of Seven Days to Noon. Even our players haven't seen the entire script. We're keeping it secret until it's ready for sale.\\" The film was made with the co operation of the war office and the police. Reception and awards=Box office= The film performed reasonably well at the box office. It was one of a string of financially successful films from Korda following a series of flops ‚Äì other hits included State Secret, The Happiest Days of Your Life and Odette. =Awards= The film received an Academy Award (Oscar) for 'Writing (Motion Picture Story)' at the 24th Academy Awards held in 1952 at the RKO Pantages Theatre. Sequel Andr√© Morell's character Superintendent Folland was revived for Roy Boulting's film High Treason. DVD release Seven Days to Noon became available on DVD in 2008.

Category:Bibliographies of wars and conflicts ","title":"Bibliography of the American Civil War"},{"id":"10385914","text":"The Bx1 and Bx2 are two bus routes that run on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, New York City. The routes, which are operated by the MTA Regional Bus Operations, also follow Sedgwick Avenue and Mosholu Parkway for a short distance at their northern end. As the numbers suggest, these were the first two bus routes in the Bronx. Route description and service Except at their extreme northern and southern ends, the Bx1 and Bx2 share the same alignment. The only differences are: *In Mott Haven (southern end), the Bx2 turns east at Hostos Community College and then runs along 149th Street to serve some of the shopping district between there and Third Avenue, then turning south onto Courtlandt Avenue, which ends at Third Avenue and 146th Street, allowing the Bx2 to continue to operate down Third Avenue toward 136th Street, while the Bx1 continues down Grand Concourse. *In Kingsbridge Heights (northern end), only the Bx1 continues down into Riverdale along 231st Street, though some early morning Bx2 cut-ins and early Sunday AM service also serves this segment. The Bx1 and Bx2 bus routes share the majority of their alignment from the Grand Concourse and 149th Street north along the Concourse and Mosholu Parkway and west along Sedgwick Avenue to Heath Avenue on the west side of the Jerome Park Reservoir. At their ends, a divergence occurs as noted above. Until August 2008, when permanent traffic changes were enacted in Mott Haven at 149th Street, Melrose/Willis Avenues, and Third Avenue, the Bx2 turned east off of the Grand Concourse at 165th Street and ran down Melrose Avenue to 149th Street. Along the way, connections to the New York City Subway can be made at: * Third Avenue‚Äì138th Street () * 138th Street‚ÄìGrand Concourse (; Bx1 only) * Third Avenue‚Äì149th Street (; Bx2 only) * 149th Street‚ÄìGrand Concourse () * 161st Street‚ÄìYankee Stadium () * Bedford Park Boulevard () * Mosholu Parkway () * 231st Street (; Bx1 and some weekday southbound and Sunday- morning Bx2 buses) As of September 2010, the Bx1 operates as a limited-stop service during the daytime on weekdays and Saturdays, while the Bx2 serves as the local. Before September 2010, both routes had a limited-stop variant. History Concourse Bus Line, Inc. was incorporated in early July 1921 by Major Emit Leindorf,The New York Times, New Incorporations, July 7, 1921, page 32 deputy police commissioner in charge of motor transport under Mayor Hylan.The New York Times, Hylan Ex-Aide Sues Fifth Av. Bus Line, October 17, 1931, page 13 The company soon began operating on the Grand Concourse as part of Hylan's \\"emergency bus lines\\". The Third Avenue Railway obtained an injunction against the operation on early March 1923,The New York Times, Bronx Bus Line Must Stop, March 4, 1923, page H8 leading the city to assign two franchises to the company in mid-April, from Grand Concourse and Mosholu Parkway south to Fifth Avenue (Harlem, Manhattan) and Melrose Avenue and 150th Street (The Hub, Bronx).The New York Times, Concourse Bus Line Gets Its Franchise, April 21, 1923, page 19 Along with a route to the Rockaways, the Concourse service was one of only two of Hylan's lines unaffected by a July 1923 injunction, since they had franchises,The New York Times, City's Bus Appeal is Denied by Court, July 15, 1923, page 1 but were discontinued anyway by September 1924The New York Times, Interboro Offers Plan to Run Buses, September 17, 1924, page 25 due to the failure of the five-cent fare to pay the costs.Zachary M. Schrag, The Bus Is Young and Honest , page 21, accessed April 1, 2007 The franchises were reassigned to the Fifth Avenue Coach Company, which began operating the routes on October 11, 1924, for ten cents. (The Manhattan line had been truncated to 138th Street in the Bronx.)The New York Times, Hylan Gives Way to 10-Cent Buses for a Bronx Need, October 11, 1924, page 1The New York Times, Ovation Welcomes Buses on Concourse, October 12, 1924, page 26 On September 14, 1927, the routes (Bx1 and Bx2 respectively) were again reassigned to the Surface Transportation Corporation, the bus subsidiary of the Third Avenue Railway, as two of its initial twelve routes.The New York Times, Bronx Bus Routes Approved by Board, September 15, 1927, page 10 In April 1928, the original terminus was at Moshulu Parkway. The bankrupt Surface Transportation Corporation's routes were taken over by Fifth Avenue Coach Lines in 1956,The New York Times, Court Completes City Bus Merger, December 18, 1956, page 1 and the New York City Transit Authority subsidiary Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority acquired all of the Fifth Avenue Coach routes in 1962.The New York Times, Profit for Seized Bus Routes Foreseen by Transit Chairman, April 11, 1962, page 31 Southbound Bx2 service originally ran via Third Avenue between East 161st Street and The Hub-East 150th Street until July 1974. Some Bx2 trips also ran via Paul Avenue and Bedford Park Boulevard in both directions until July 1974, when the Bx1 took over this role. The original northwestern terminus of the Bx1 was at Broadway and 231st Street. The Bx1 was extended to Riverdale at West 246th Street in February 1984, and was later cut back to its current terminus in 1990 after the Bx7 started running all times except nights. Some Bx1 trips also ran via Paul Avenue and Bedford Park Boulevard in both directions until March 1993. Limited-Stop service was introduced to the Bx1 on February 23, 1993 as a weekday rush hour-only service. Initially, it would have been implemented in January. This service improvement was put into place as part of the Fare Deal Ridership Growth Program. The change resulted in an increase in ridership. In July 1994, the Board approved a plan to expand the hours of limited-stop service to operate continuously between 6:30 a.m. and 7 p.m., and to introduce Bx2 limited-stop service, to go into effect in September 1994. In March 1995, all Sunday Bx1 service began running via the Grand Concourse north of Bedford Park Boulevard. Between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. alternate buses had run along Paul Avenue and West 205th Street. This branch was underutilized, serving fewer than ten passengers, and the split in service underserved the Grand Concourse. Limited-stop service was eventually extended to run weekdays and Saturdays in September 1996. On September 8, 2002, the Bx1 and Bx2 were extended to a new terminal at Lincoln Avenue and 138th Street. The Bx1 had terminated at the 138th Street‚ÄìGrand Concourse subway station, while the Bx2 had terminated at East 150th Street- Melrose Avenue near the Third Avenue‚Äì149th Street subway station. Bx2 service ran along East 165th Street and Melrose Avenue until August 2008, when all buses started running at East 149th Street and Third Avenue. On September 12, 2010, the Bx2 limited-stop service was eliminated, with all Bx2 buses running as locals. In addition, all Bx1s on weekdays between 6 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. and on Saturdays between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. began operating as limiteds.

Erinacine A Erinacine A, isolated from the cultured mycelia of Hericium erinaceum, the main representative of this compounds group, has an enhancing effect on nerve growth factor synthesis in vitro. It also increases catecholamine in the central nervous system of rats. Hericenones and erinacines were isolated from the fruiting body and mycelium of H. erinaceus, respectively, and most of the compounds promote NGF biosynthesis in rodent cultured astrocytes. Among its active compounds, only erinacine A has confirmed pharmacological actions in the central nervous system in rats. Hence, this review has summarized the available information on the neurohealth properties of H. erinaceus mycelia enriched with erinacines, which may contribute to further research on the therapeutic roles of these mycelia. The safety of this mushroom has also been discussed. Although it has been difficult to extrapolate the in vivo studies to clinical situations, preclinical studies have shown that there can be improvements in ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and depression if H. erinaceus mycelia enriched with erinacines are included in daily meals. Decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible NO synthase (iNOS), however, have been detected in ischemic neurons after mycelia exposure.

Her father, as Reichsf√ºhrer-SS, was a leading member of the Nazi Party, and chief architect of the Final Solution. After the Allied victory, she was arrested and made to testify at the Nuremberg trials. Never renouncing Nazi ideology, she consistently fought to defend her father's reputation and became closely involved in Neo-Nazi groups that give support to ex-members of the SS. She married Wulf Dieter Burwitz, an official of the extremist NPD. Relationship with her father Gudrun with her parents Born in Munich in 1929, Gudrun Himmler was the daughter of Heinrich Himmler, Reichsf√ºhrer-SS, Chief of Police and Security forces, and Reich Minister of the Interior in Nazi Germany. She was the only child of Himmler and his wife Margarete Siegroth, n√©e Boden, though her parents later adopted a son. (Himmler also had two illegitimate children with his secretary, Hedwig Potthast.) Heinrich Himmler adored his daughter and had her regularly flown to his offices in Berlin from Munich where she lived with her mother. When she was at home, he telephoned her most days and wrote to her every week. He continued to call her by her childhood nickname \\"P√ºppi\\" throughout his life. She accompanied her father on some official duties. She disputed that Heinrich Himmler, who died in British captivity on 23 May 1945, took his own life by breaking a concealed cyanide capsule, and instead maintained that he was murdered. After the Second World War, she and her mother were arrested by the Americans and held in various camps in Italy, France and Germany. They were brought to Nuremberg to testify at the trials, and were released in November 1946.Katrin Himmler, The Himmler Brothers, Pan Macmillan, 2012, p.275. Gudrun later bitterly referred to this time as the most difficult of her life, and said that she and her mother were treated as though they had to atone for the sins of her father. She never renounced the Nazi ideology and repeatedly sought to justify the actions of her father, relative to the context of his time. People who knew her say that Gudrun created a \\"golden image\\" of her father, to atone for the father she wished she had; Himmler had a history of cheating on his wife and being unfaithful to his marriage. Later life She married the journalist and author Wulf Dieter Burwitz, who later became a party official in the Bavarian section of the far-right NPD, and had two children. She was affiliated with Stille Hilfe (\\"Silent Aid\\"), an organization formed to aid former SS members, which assisted Klaus Barbie (\\"the Butcher of Lyon\\") of the Lyon Gestapo and Martin Sommer, otherwise known as the \\"Hangman of Buchenwald\\", and she reportedly continued to support a Protestant old people's home in Pullach, near Munich. From 1961 to 1963, she worked, under an assumed name, as a secretary for West Germany's intelligence agency, the Federal Intelligence Service (BND), at its headquarters in Pullach. At the time the agency was headed by Reinhard Gehlen, an American-recruited general who hired, among others, ex-Nazis to work for BND based on their connections and experience with Eastern Europe and anti-communist activities; he retired in 1968, one year after the normal age of retirement for civil servants in West Germany. For decades Gudrun Burwitz was a prominent public figure in Stille Hilfe. At various meetings, for instance the annual Ulrichsberg gathering in Austria, she received the status of both a star and an authority. Oliver Schr√∂m, author of a book about the organisation, described her as a \\"flamboyant Nazi princess\\" (\\"schillernde Nazi-Prinzessin\\").Fabian Leber: Gudrun Burwitz und die ‚ÄûStille Hilfe‚Äú: Die schillernde Nazi-Prinzessin; in: Der Tagesspiegel, 10 June 2001 (In German) Peter Finkelgrun, a German-Jewish investigative journalist, discovered that Burwitz provided financial support for Anton Malloth, a former Nazi prison guard and a fugitive war criminal. In 2001, Malloth was convicted of beating at least 100 prisoners to death at the Theresienstadt concentration camp, including Finkelgrun's father in 1943.

Biography Johnson was born on June 12, 1888, at Lee's Ferry, Arizona, to Warren Marshall Johnson, a first-generation convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and one of his wives, Permelia Smith Johnson., 4:1223. Most of his ancestry was British, and many of his ancestors were born in British Colonial America. Johnson was baptized into the LDS Church at the age of eight, not long after church president Wilford Woodruff's 1890 Manifesto renouncing plural marriage was issued., 2:693. His father, upon reading the Manifesto, addressed \\"To Whom It May Concern,\\" simply stated that it did not concern him. Johnson took issue with the Manifesto, being very outspoken about his belief in \\"the Celestial Law\\" even before learning about the formal fundamentalist movement within Mormonism., 3:1159 (\\"I tried for some years before I became acquainted with President Barlow or President John W. Woolley to get into the principle of plural marriage, because I had it in my heart\\".) His convictions were strengthened after he traveled to Short Creek straddling the Utah-Arizona border, where a prominent polygamous community was coalescing, and acquainted himself with movement leaders such as John W. Woolley, Joseph White Musser, and John Y. Barlow., 6:346. Johnson and his wife Josephine Ford Johnson were excommunicated from the LDS Church in 1935 along with most of the rest of the Short Creek Community after they refused to sign an affidavit abandoning their belief in plural marriage. Then, Johnson chose to officially join the \\"Woolley group\\" of fundamentalists, the spiritual predecessor to the modern Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church), and was eventually ordained an apostle by John Y. Barlow and became one of the group's Council of the Priesthood., 6:343.. Johnson became a leader of the polygamous movement after Barlow's death in 1949. He did not initially consider his group a distinct organization from the Salt Lake-based LDS Church, describing it simply as \\"the Fundamentalist division of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\\" but by 1952, he openly remarked that he and his followers \\"have separated ourselves from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as it now stands.\\", 4:1635., 5:28. Despite being plagued by incidents such as the 1953 Short Creek raid, Johnson's thirty-two-year tenure as senior member of the Priesthood Council has been characterized as \\"a time of stability, growth, financial success, and greater public acceptance.\\" While Johnson is today recognized as a prophet of the FLDS Church, he only implicitly referred to his own prophetic status: \\"You have heard other men call me a prophet, but you have never heard me make the claim.\\" The non-LDS Mormon prophet Robert Crossfield delivered a revelation http://www.2bc.info/pdf/Colorado%20City.pdf to Johnson calling him to repentance, but Johnson rejected it. While acting as Prophet, Johnson dismissed J. Marion Hammon and Alma Adelbert Timpson from the Council of Friends for their opposition to the \\"One Man Doctrine\\". Hammon and Timpson went on to form the Centennial Park group (or \\"Second Ward\\") of polygamists just south of Colorado City. Following Johnson's death in Hildale, Utah, on November 25, 1986, Rulon Jeffs succeeded him as leader of the FLDS Church. Although Johnson had been very ill and unable to mingle among the people for several years, his passing created a \\"climate of upheaval\\" within the community, during which the church became increasingly authoritarian. (\\"Uncle Roy ... was by then ninety-three years old, very ill, and fast fading into senility .... In 1986 Uncle Roy died, and Rulon Jeffs became the UEP's new prophet. In the climate of upheaval that followed, there was turmoil in both Bountiful and Colorado City.\\") The numbers of apostates gradually increased, spiking in the early 21st century, with the turmoil accompanying the imprisonment of Jeffs's son, church president Warren Jeffs, on two counts of child sexual assault. In recent years, Johnson's tenure as Prophet has become a focal point for Mormon fundamentalists disaffected with the modern FLDS Church. For instance, one of Warren Jeffs's brothers noted that Uncle Roy was a \\"warm, loving\\" prophet who \\"taught polygamy for the right reasons,\\" but Jeffs \\"has no love for the people.\\" Johnson's birthday was celebrated as a holiday within the FLDS Church until the practice was discontinued by Warren Jeffs in 2003. (\\"Warren announced that this year we would not be celebrating Uncle Roy's birthday. Though Uncle Roy had begun this tradition himself, and it had been carried on for years, Warren declared that the event was not what Uncle Roy would have wanted.\\") (\\"Warren had already begun cracking down on the people of Short Creek: canceling the 2003 celebration of Leroy Johnson's birthday in June and the Pioneer Day Parade in July, which commemorates the date that Mormons first settled in the Salt Lake Valley.\\") See also * List of Mormon fundamentalist leaders NotesReferences  * External links * Category:Mormon fundamentalist leaders Category:American Latter Day Saint leaders Category:Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints members Category:1888 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Prophets in Mormonism Category:People excommunicated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Category:People from Short Creek Community Category:Religious leaders from Utah Category:Religious leaders from Arizona ","title":"Leroy S.

Based on the 1954 novel L'Horloger d'Everton by Georges Simenon, it tells the story of a widowed father who first discovers how little he knows about his teenage son, who kills a man and with his girl goes on the run, but then decides that whatever their faults he will stand by the pair. The film was entered into the 24th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Silver Bear - Special Jury Prize. In the United States, it was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film by the U.S. National Board of Review. Plot Respected professionally and socially, the widowed watchmaker Michel Descombes lives peacefully over his shop in Lyons with his teenage son Bernard, who works in a factory. One morning when his son has not come home, which is not unusual, police arrive and take Michel to see their inspector, who gradually breaks the news that the boy has killed a man and fled with a girl called Liliane. Michel knows nothing of the victim, an unpopular security guard at the factory, or of the girl, who worked there. In shock, he naively tells intrusive journalists whatever they want to hear. Once calmer, he realises he must be on his guard and when two thugs break his windows, he and his assistant beat them up, throwing one in the river. He visits the old woman who looked after Bernard when his mother died and discovers that she is closer to the boy than he is. The inspector, hoping that Michel may lead them to the runaway pair, puts a lot of effort into winning his confidence. When the police do trace the two to a town in the north, he invites Michel to travel up with him. Arrested, the young people are flown back to Lyon for trial and Michel hires a lawyer, who has his own ideas on defence. It is alleged that the murdered man demanded sex from Liliane or he would frame her for stealing. The inspector also thinks the crime was not premeditated but the court is not convinced, giving Bernard 20 years for murder and Liliane 5 for abetting. Michel visits Bernard in prison to tell him that Liliane is pregnant and that he, with her parents, will look after the child. The two discuss possible names.

The next two seasons were spent with Hartford, and in 1942, Hodgin played for the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League. In 1943 he joined the Chicago White Sox and hit a career-high .314. Hodgin had another strong season in 1944 and hit .295, but the 1945 season was spent in the military. Afterwards, he rejoined the White Sox in 1946. Then, in 1947 he suffered a concussion after he was hit on the skull by a pitch from future Hall of Fame pitcher Hal Newhouser. After that Hodgin lost some of his aggressiveness at the plate, hitting .266 in 114 games for the Sox in 1948, his last major league season. He continued to play for several more seasons in the Pacific Coast League and then the Carolina League. In a six-season big- league career, Hodgin was a .285 hitter (481-for-1,689) with four home runs and 188 RBI in 530 games, including 198 runs, 79 doubles, 24 triples, and seven stolen bases. A hard-to-strike-out hitter, he posted a solid 1.54 BB/K (97-to-63). He died on October 4, 2011, in Burlington, North Carolina.

It is a mockbuster of the film Conan the Barbarian, which was released in the same year. Plot As the film opens, a baby named Ator is born with a birthmark that signals he will someday destroy the Spider Cult which currently holds power over the land. Fearing this prophecy, the leader of the cult ‚ÄîHigh Priest of The Ancient One, Dakkar (Dakar)‚Äî attempts to kill the baby. Baby Ator's birthmark is covered up, however, and he is whisked off to a village far away where he is given to a couple to raise as their own. Years later, Ator (O'Keefe), now in love with his sister Sunya (Brown), asks his father for permission to marry her. Ator's father reveals to Ator that he is adopted, and can therefore marry Sunya if he likes. On the day of their wedding, the village is raided by the Spider Cult's soldiers and several women are taken, including Ator's new bride. After pursuing the soldiers, Ator soon finds himself training with Griba, a warrior who is an enemy of The Ancient One, and also the person who whisked him away at his birth. Griba disappears, though, after which Ator is kidnapped by Amazons, nearly seduced by a witch, and undergoes a quest to retrieve a magical mirrored shield. While kidnapped by the Amazons, Ator is \\"won\\" by Roon (Siani), a fierce blonde thief whom he helped earlier in the film. Roon is enamored with Ator, so she decides to flee with him and assist him during his quest. Ator is successful in obtaining the mirror, then uses it to fight and defeat Dakkar. His victory is muddied by the revelation that Griba is actually Dakkar's predecessor, and had trained Ator so that he could retake his position as High Priest. Ator defeats Griba, however, leaving him to be devoured by the offspring of The Ancient One, a giant spider which dwells within the temple. To ensure that the cult does not return, Ator then provokes and kills The Ancient One itself. Afterwards, with Roon having perished while infiltrating the temple, Ator and Sunya head back to their village, presumably to live in peace together.

He did it in collaboration with Marco Modugno. Both had previously worked together on the film Bambul√® (1979)‚ÄîModugno as director, Soavi as assistant director. Regarding the statement D'Amato gave to Nocturno, Giusti does not give an indication of edition or year, but seems to quote it word by word. The film was developed under the working title of Fantasy. Later, the script was revised by Jos√© Maria Sanchez and the film's director Joe D'Amato. D'Amato said in an interview that the script was \\"written by Jose Maria Sanchez\\", without mentioning Soavi or Modugno.Palmerini, Luca M.; Mistretta, Gaetano (1996). \\"Spaghetti Nightmares\\". Fantasma Books. p. 79.. In the credits, the pseudonym \\"Sherry Russel\\" was used. In a statement printed in the Italian magazine Nocturno, director Joe D'Amato complained that although Miles O'Keefe, the actor who played Ator, had a nice athletic physique and was a really nice guy (lang-it:un ragazzo d'oro), he recited his lines badly and was behaving listlessly during fight scenes. D'Amato praised the weapons master Franco Ukmar for doing \\"an incredible job\\" on him. Release Ator, the Fighting Eagle passed the Italian censorship board on 14 September 1982 and was released in Italy on 7 October 1982. It was released in the United States on 11 March 1983. The film was featured in Season 12 of Mystery Science Theater 3000 on November 22, 2018. A Blu-ray release was set for release in September 2019 by Dark Force Entertainment.

It is based around three key themes: * How to have fun * How to stay in control (or how to take control) * How to report a problem The education programme consists of a presentation, which is given to young people in schools, youth groups and other youth environments, a website aimed directly at young people, which also contains information for teachers and parents, a number of hard-hitting education films designed to make young people think about whom they are talking to online, and other resources including posters and a range of promotional material. The Website=Young People= The website was originally started in 2001 at the Home Office and was advertised on television and in cinemas; however, in April 2006, it was taken over by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, who now keep it running. The website was designed by Contrapositive, with input from the CEOP Centre's dedicated youth panel, to make it relevant to young people. The first CEOP- created version of the website was split into three main areas, each linked to one of the programmes main themes, and a colour, which ran throughout pages in that area of the website, and also the presentation, with the website then being split into eight areas in each of these (except How to Report) each about a new technology, and how to either have fun with it safely or how to stay in control when using it. The section entitled \\"How to Report\\" included information on what can be reported to the CEOP centre online, and how to do this, and fills only one page. On 22 October 2007, the first major revision to the website was launched, a majority of the content of the previous website continues, however now in a dedicated 11‚Äì16 section, and new sections for those aged 5‚Äì7 (featuring Hector, a cartoon dolphin), and an 8‚Äì11 section, which is based around a Flash-based cyber cafe, in which virtual young people are experimenting with new technologies. On 9 February 2009, the Thinkuknow Australia website was launched for teachers, parents and carers. It was created by the Australian Federal Police in close consultation with CEOP, the Australian Communications and Media Authority and Microsoft Australia. It is expected that this site will grow to include information and resources for young people of all ages, in similar fashion to the Thinkuknow UK website. =Adults= The main splash page links to Teacher and Parent areas, each of which have a simple, professional theme. The teachers area allows teachers to download materials for use in the classroom, and the parents area includes information on what is good, bad and dangerous about new technologies. The Thinkuknow Australia site also provides information and download materials for teachers and parents, catering specifically to the Australian community. Presentation The programme also contains a Flash-based interactive presentation, which is given to young people in schools and other youth environments. It is based around the programme's three main themes, with colour-coded screens for each, and the education films embedded. It is designed to be talked through by a presenter, and includes points for discussion and demonstrations, like online reporting. It was originally estimated that between September 2006 and March 2007, 1 million young people would have seen the presentation, although it has since emerged that this will be nearer half a million, and a million by the end of the academic year. Films Both the website and presentation include hard-hitting education films, and currently three have been released. =Clare's Story= Clare's Story was the first film, made by Straker Films for the Centre before it opened in early 2006, and was featured extensively in media coverage of the launch. It uses \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" by the band Oasis and opens with Clare, a teenage girl, crying, having just been abused, then goes in reverse to show her leaving the attackers home, and meeting her attacker. It proceeds to show them chatting over MSN Messenger before they met up, and then she is asked to \\"take her top off\\". She reports this through the CEOP centre's website and is free to continue her life as normal. In the ICVA awards, Clare's Story won Gold for Best Public Charity and Public Welfare film and Best Editing, and bronze for Best Director. =Tom's Story= This film is based around a boy named Tom, who enjoys football and meets a similar boy online named Jack. Jack asks Tom to go football training with him, and Tom agrees. When he arrives at Jack's house, Tom is greeted by a grown man who claims to be Jack's older brother. He offers to let him come in and wait for Jack to get home. While they are waiting, Jack's brother offers Tom a beer, and later another, and then \\"quite a few\\". When Jack's brother closes the curtains, Tom asks about Jack, whom his brother says won't be coming. Tom then deduces that Jack is the grown man in front of him, and not the boy in the photo he saw. Jack holds Tom down and starts to remove his clothes, while telling him \\"shh\\". The film then cuts to where Tom is leaving, crying, while Jack watches from the window. Tom, thinking that there is no one he can tell, shuts himself in his bedroom, then remembers about the ThinkUKnow website, which he learned about in school. He reports \\"Jack\\", then considers what would have happened if he had followed the website's advice and suggested bringing his father to meet Jack. The film ends with Tom playing football, while Jack is arrested by the police. In the ICVA awards, Tom's Story won Gold for Best Education Film.

On the fourth day of Onam celebrations (Nalaam Onam), performers painted like tigers and hunters in bright yellow, red, and black dance to the beats of instruments like Udukku and Thakil. Literal meaning of Pulikkali is the 'play of the tigers' hence the performance revolve around the theme of tiger hunting. The folk art is mainly practiced in Thrissur district of Kerala. Best place to watch the show is at Thrissur on the fourth day of Onam, where Pulikkali troupes from all over the district assemble to display their skills. The festival attracts thousands of people to the Thrissur city. Pulikkali is also performed during various other festive seasons. History The origin of Pulikkali dates back to over 200 years, when the Maharaja Rama Varma Sakthan Thampuran, the then Maharaja of Cochin, is said to have introduced the folk art, who wanted to celebrate Onam with a dance that reflected the wild and macho spirit of the force. Later, Konar of (Pattalam Road) used to celebrate with great fervor. They popularised the folk genre with steps and body language peculiar to a tiger being stalked by a hunter, enacting a play of the hunter and the beast. Along with the celebrations, they used to perform the art form decked as tigers with peculiar steps resembling the tiger, then known as 'Pulikkettikali' which was immensely enjoyed by the locals. Pulikkali in Thrissur is held in memory of this event. Modern Rehana Fathima (woman artist) with body art celebrating the festival of Puli Kali in the streets of Kerala in 2016. Over the years, there has been changes in the adornment of Pulikkali dancers. In the early days, masks were not used and participants would have themselves painted all over, on their faces as well. But now, ready made masks, cosmetic teeth, tongues, beards and mustaches are used by the participants along with the paint on their bodies. The tigers also wear a broad belt with jingles around their waist. The festival in Thrissur has now become an all peoples event with huge response from people, especially youths who come forward to participate in the festival, and also from sponsors. The event is organized by the Pulikkali Co-ordination Committee, a unified council of Pulikkali groups formed in 2004 in Thrissur to preserve and propagate the art in all its true hues and tones. The Thrissur Municipal Corporation give a grant of Rs 30,000 for each Pulikkali troupe. A striking feature of this folk art is the colorful appearance of the performers. A particular combination of tempera powder and varnish or enamel is used to make the paint. First of all, the dancers remove the hair from the body, and then, the base coat of paint is applied on them. It takes two to three hours for the coating to dry. After that, the second coat of paint is applied with enhanced design. This entire procedure takes at least five to seven hours. A large number of artists gather to apply paint on the tigers. It is a meticulous process and often starts from the wee hours in the morning. By afternoon the Pulikkali groups or 'sangams' as they are called, from all four corners of Thrissur move in a procession, dancing, pouncing and shaking their bellies to the beat of the drums through the streets to the Swaraj Round, Thrissur situated in the heart of the city through Palace Road, Karunakaran Nambiar Road, Shornur Road, A R Menon Road and MG Road. Pulikkali 2010 Scenes such as the tiger preying on an animal, and a tiger being hunted by a game- hunter are enacted beautifully in between. Thousands of spectators line the streets enjoying the dance, cheering the dancers some of them even trying to join in. The groups assemble at Naduvilal in the Swaraj Round, Thrissur in front of the Vadakkunnathan Temple and offer a coconut each to the deity of the Ganapati shrine (Naduvilal Ganapati Kovil) here, before going on a procession around the ground. The procession also include floats from each village. The different troupes vie with each other to make the best floats as well as the best dressed tigers.

A connection is drawn from migration to the stages of within the Demographic Transition Model (DTM). It was developed by Wilbur Zelinsky, longtime professor of geography at the Pennsylvania State University.  Model stages  Stage one (‚ÄúPremodern traditional society‚Äù): This is before the onset of the urbanization, and it is very little to no migration and natural increase rates are about zero. There are very high levels of mobility (nomadism), but very little migration. Stage two (‚ÄúEarly transitional society‚Äù): During stage two a ‚Äúmassive movement from the countryside to cities\\" occurs. And as a \\"community experiences the process of modernization‚Äù. There is a ‚Äúrapid rate of natural increase‚Äù. And Internationally there is a high rate of emigration, although the total population number is still rising. Stage three (‚ÄúLate transitional society‚Äù): Stage three corresponds to the ‚Äúcritical rung...of the mobility transition‚Äù where urban-to-urban migration surpasses the rural-to-urban migration, where rural-to-urban migration ‚Äúcontinues but at waning absolute or relative rates‚Äù, and ‚Äúa complex migrational and circular movements within the urban network, from city to city or within a single metropolitan region‚Äù increased, circulation and non-economic migration start to emerge. Then the net-out migration trend shifts to a net-in migration trend as more people immigrate than emigrate. That is, more people move in rather than out. Stage four (‚ÄúAdvanced society‚Äù): During stage four the ‚Äúmovement from the countryside to the city continues but is further reduced in absolute and relative terms, vigorous movement of migrants from city to city and within individual urban agglomerations...especially within a highly elaborated lattice of major and minor metropolises‚Äù is observed. A large increase in urban to suburban migration can also occur. There is a ‚Äúslight to moderate rate of natural increase or none at all‚Äù. Stage five (‚ÄúFuture super-advanced society‚Äù): During stage five ‚ÄúNearly all residential migration may be of the interurban and intraurban variety‚Ä¶. No plausible predictions of fertility behavior because of a declining population,...a stable mortality pattern slightly below present levels‚Äù.

Until the death of John Rice on November 5, 2005, the two held the world record for being the shortest living twins, standing only . Early lives John and Greg Rice were born on December 3, 1951 at St. Mary's Hospital in West Palm Beach, Florida. Their biological mother abandoned them a few hours after giving birth, purportedly due to the diagnosis of dwarfism. After eight months of being cared for by hospital staff, the infants were taken in as foster children by Frank and Mildred Windsor. Mildred died when the boys were in eighth grade due to ovarian cancer. Following the loss of their foster mother and the death of their foster father three years later, the two were raised by their foster sister, Betty Windsor. Despite the difficulties of their condition as well as the loss of their foster parents, John and Greg participated in \\"normal\\" childhood activities such as the Boy Scouts, took regular classes throughout their education, and even played cornet in the junior high and high school band.

It was there they became two of the most recognizable experts in their field in the U.S. They later went into the motivational speaking business. in 1980, the brothers appeared in Hardly Working, a comedy directed by Jerry Lewis. The twins appeared on the television series Real People as motivational speakers, and then went on to play landlords in the 1981 television series Foul Play. They also hosted a short-lived game show titled That . . . Quiz Show in 1982. In 1989, the twins appeared in commercials for a chain of pizza restaurants known as Pizza Factory. In the 1990s, the twins became local celebrities in south Florida when they began starring in commercials for a pest control company.

He got his start in the entertainment industry as the leader of a puppet theater in Kobe. This led to an association with Tokyo Movie Shinsha, one of the first Japanese animation studios. In 1969, ≈åsumi collaborated with animator Yasuo ≈åtsuka in the Moomin TV series, which was an immediate hit. But Finnish author Tove Jansson, creator of the Moomin books, objected strongly to the depiction of the characters in the series. According to Jansson, \\"My Moomin is No car, No fight, and No money.\\" The series was shifted to another studio after 26 episodes. Also in 1969, he collaborated with ≈åtsuka on the classic Lupin III TV series. This series opened to poor ratings and was cancelled after only 23 episodes. ≈åsumi directed the first seven episodes and episodes nine and twelve, with the remaining episodes being directed jointly by Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. ≈åsumi was fired by the studio for refusing to adapt the sophisticated series for a children's audience. He went on to direct film and television animations for a number of other studios, and for the national broadcaster NHK. In 1993, he returned to direct one more Lupin episode, entitled Orders to Assassinate Lupin.

It is made from a base of fresh oranges which are dried and mixed with a solution of alcohol which is distilled. Picon also contains gentian and quinquina in equal measures. Sugar, syrup and caramel are added last.  Origins  Ga√©tan Picon, born in 1809, was a scholar who had an apprenticeship at the distilleries of Aix-en-Provence, Toulon and Marseille. In 1837, after taking a trip to Algeria where he had been in the French Army, he invented Picon. The aperitif was placed in the category of bitters and was 39% alcohol by volume (ABV). At the time, Ga√©tan Picon had created the first distillery to produce African bitters in an Algerian village. He then went on to open a number of other distilleries in Constantine, B√¥ne and Algiers. In 1862, the French government invited industry to take part in the Universal Exhibition in London. Jean-Baptiste Nouvion, the sub-prefect of Philippeville, urged Ga√©tan Picon to bring his aperitif to the exhibition. But, failing to convince the manufacturer to take part, the sub-prefect stubbornly took it upon himself (without telling Mr. Picon) to ship a case of African Amer to London.Journal \\"L'Illustration\\" du 24 mai 1930 ‚Äì histoire de l‚Äôap√©ritif amer Picon ou amer alg√©rien The product ended up crowned with a bronze medal in the bitter aperitif category, greatly adding to Ga√©tan Picon's eventual fortune. In 1872, Ga√©tan Picon returned to France, creating the first factory for the production of Picon in Marseille, which is still in use today. In 1937, the company published a book called Histoire d'un Si√®cle Picon (1837‚Äì1937); the company slogan at the time was \\"Il n'est plus une partie du globe o√π n'ait p√©n√©tr√© le Picon!\\" (literal translation: \\"There is no longer any part of the world where Picon hasn't penetrated\\"). The slogan involves a common pun in French.  Today  Picon Punch, served in the traditional custom glass used in Northern Nevada. Santa Fe Hotel, Reno, Nevada. Since 1995 Picon has diversified, and now makes two different aperitifs: * The original Picon bi√®re, which accompanies beer. * Picon club, to drink in cocktails with dry white wine. In the 1970s, the strength of Picon was reduced to 25% ABV. In 1989, it was reduced yet again to 18% ABV. In 2003 the drink was mainly sold (70%) in the north and east of France. The total production was 4 million bottles. Picon Punch is a mixed drink featuring Amer Picon (or another Amer substitute), created by Basque immigrants in the United States. It is primarily served in American Basque regions such as Boise, Idaho; Bakersfield, California; and throughout Northern Nevada. The unavailability of Picon in America has led to two drinks regularly used as substitutes: Torani Amer (available primarily in California) and Amer Boudreau, a DIY drink created by Seattle-based mixologist, bartender and author Jamie Boudreau to the specifications of the pre-1970 recipe for Picon.

These responses usually tend to offset the beneficial effects of the new technology or other measures taken. While the literature on the rebound effect generally focuses on the effect of technological improvements on energy consumption, the theory can also be applied to the use of any natural resource or other input, such as labor. The rebound effect is generally expressed as a ratio of the lost benefit compared to the expected environmental benefit when holding consumption constant. For instance, if a 5% improvement in vehicle fuel efficiency results in only a 2% drop in fuel use, there is a 60% rebound effect (since = 60%). The 'missing' 3% might have been consumed by driving faster or further than before. The existence of the rebound effect is uncontroversial. However, debate continues as to the magnitude and impact of the effect in real world situations. Depending on the magnitude of the rebound effect, there are five different rebound effect (RE) types: #Super conservation (RE < 0): the actual resource savings are higher than expected savings ‚Äì the rebound effect is negative. This occurs if the increase in efficiency reduces costs. #Zero rebound (RE = 0): The actual resource savings are equal to expected savings ‚Äì the rebound effect is zero. #Partial rebound (0 < RE < 1): The actual resource savings are less than expected savings ‚Äì the rebound effect is between 0% and 100%. This is sometimes known as 'take-back', and is the most common result of empirical studies on individual markets. #Full rebound (RE = 1): The actual resource savings are equal to the increase in usage ‚Äì the rebound effect is at 100%. #Backfire (RE > 1): The actual resource savings are negative because usage increased beyond potential savings ‚Äì the rebound effect is higher than 100%. This situation is commonly known as the Jevons paradox. In order to avoid the rebound effect, environmental economists have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be taxed in order to keep the cost of use the same. History The rebound effect was first described by William Stanley Jevons in his 1865 book The Coal Question, where he observed that the invention in Britain of a more efficient steam engine meant that the use of coal became economically viable for many new uses. This ultimately led to increased coal demand and much increased coal consumption, even as the amount of coal required for any particular use fell. According to Jevons, \\"It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth.\\" However, most contemporary authors credit Daniel Khazzoom for the re-emergence of the rebound effect in the research literature. Although Khazzoom did not use the term, he raised the idea that there is a less than one-to-one correlation between gains in energy efficiency and reductions in energy use, because of a change in the 'price content' of energy in the provision of the final consumer product. His study was based on energy efficiency gains in home appliances, but the principle applies throughout the economy. A commonly studied example is that of a more fuel- efficient car. As each kilometre of travel becomes cheaper, there will be an increase in driving speed and/or kilometres driven, as long as the price elasticity of demand for car travel is not zero. Other examples might include the growth in garden lighting after the introduction of energy-saving Light Emitting Diodes or the increasing size of houses driven partly by higher fuel efficiency in home heating technologies. If the rebound effect is larger than 100%, all gains from the increased fuel efficiency would be wiped out by increases in demand (the Jevons paradox). Khazzoom's thesis was criticized heavily by Michael Grubb and Amory Lovins And: who dismissed any disconnection between energy efficiency improvements in an individual market, and an economy-wide reduction in energy consumption. Developing Khazzoom's idea further, and prompting heated debate in the Energy Policy journal at that time, Len Brookes wrote of the fallacies in the energy-efficiency solution to greenhouse gas emissions. His analysis showed that any economically justified improvements in energy efficiency would in fact stimulate economic growth and increase total energy use. For improvements in energy efficiency to contribute to a reduction in economy-wide energy consumption, the improvement must come at a greater economic cost. Commenting in regard to energy efficiency advocates, he concludes that, \\"the present high profile of the topic seems to owe more to the current tide of green fervor than to sober consideration of the facts, and the validity and cost of solutions.\\" =Khazzoom-Brookes postulate= In 1992, economist Harry Saunders coined the term \\"Khazzoom- Brookes postulate\\" to describe the idea that energy efficiency gains paradoxically result in increases in energy use (the modern day equivalent of the Jevons paradox). He modeled energy efficiency gains using a variety of neoclassical growth models, and showed that the postulate is true over a wide range of assumptions. In the conclusion of his paper, Saunders stated that: This work provided a theoretical grounding for empirical studies and played an important role in defining the problem of the rebound effect. It also reinforced an emerging ideological divide between energy economists on the extent of the yet to be named effect. The two tightly held positions are: *Technological improvements in energy efficiency enable economic growth that was otherwise impossible without the improvement; as such, energy efficiency improvements will usually back-fire in the long term. *Technological improvements in energy efficiency may result in a small take-back. However, even in the long term, energy efficiency improvements usually result in large overall energy savings. Even though many studies have been undertaken in this area, neither position has yet claimed a consensus view in the academic literature. Recent studies have demonstrated that direct rebound effects are significant (about 30% for energy), but that there is not enough information about indirect effects to know whether or how often back-fire occurs. Economists tend to the first position, but most governments, businesses, and environmental groups adhere to the second. Governments and environmental groups often advocate further research into fuel efficiency and radical increases in the efficient use of energy as the primary means for reducing energy use and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (to alleviate the impacts of climate change). However, if the first position more accurately reflects economic reality, current efforts to invent fuel-efficient technologies may not much reduce energy use, and may in fact paradoxically increase oil and coal consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, over the long run. Types of effects The full rebound effect can be distinguished into three different economic reactions to technological changes: # Direct rebound effect: An increase in consumption of a good is caused by the lower cost of use. This is caused by the substitution effect. # Indirect rebound effect: The lower cost of a service enables increased household consumption of other goods and services. For example, the savings from a more efficient cooling system may be put into another luxury good. This is caused by the income effect. # Economy wide effect: The fall in service cost reduces the price of other goods, creates new production possibilities and increases economic growth. In the example of improved vehicle fuel efficiency, the direct effect would be the increased fuel use from more driving as driving becomes cheaper. The indirect effect would incorporate the increased consumption of other goods enabled by household cost savings from increased fuel efficiency. Since consumption of other goods increases, the embodied fuel used in the production of those goods would increase as well. Finally, the economy-wide effect would include the long-term effect of the increase in vehicle fuel efficiency on production and consumption possibilities throughout the economy, including any effects on economic growth rates. =Direct and indirect effects= Direct and Indirect Effects For cost reducing resource efficiency, distinguishing between direct and indirect effects is shown in Figure 1 below. The horizontal axis shows units of consumption of the targets good (which could be for example clothes washing, and measured in terms of kilograms of clean clothes) with consumption of all other goods and services on the vertical axis. An economical technology change that enables each unit of washing to be produced with less electricity results in a reduction of the price per unit of washing. This shifts the household budget line rightwards. The result is a substitution effect because of the decreased relative price, but also an income effect due to the increased real income. The substitution effect increases consumption of washing from Q1 to QS, and the income effect from QS to Q2. The total increase in consumption of washing from Q1 to Q2 and the resulting increase in electricity consumption is the direct effect. The indirect effect comprises the increase in other consumption, from O1 to O2. The scale of each of these effects depends on the elasticity of demand for each of the goods, and the embodied resource or externality associated with each good. Indirect effects are difficult to measure empirically. In the manufacturing sector, it has been estimated that there is about a 24% rebound effect due to increases in fuel efficiency. A parallel effect will happen for cost saving efficient technologies for producers, where output and substitution effects will occur. The rebound effect can increase the difficulty of projecting the reduction in greenhouse emissions from an improvement in energy efficiency. Estimation of the scale of direct effects on residential electricity, heating and motor fuel consumption has been common motivation for research of rebound effects. Evaluation and econometric methods are the two approaches generally employed in estimating the size of this effect. Evaluation methods rely on quasi- experimental studies and measure the before and after changes to energy consumption from the implementation of energy efficient technology, while econometric methods utilize elasticity estimates to forecast the likely effects from changes in the effective price of energy services. Research has found that in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small to moderate, ranging from roughly 5% to 40% in residential space heating and cooling. Some of the direct rebound effect can be attributed to consumers who were previously unable to use a service. However, the rebound effect may be more significant in the context of the undeveloped markets in developing economies. = Indirect effects from conservation = Figure2: change in preferences of a household revealing indirect effects from conservation For conservation measures, indirect effects closely approximate the total economy- wide effect. Conservation measures constitute a change in consumption patterns away from particular targeted goods towards other goods. Figure 2 shows that a change in preference of a household results in a new consumption pattern that has less of the target good (QT to QT'), and more of all other goods (QO to QO'). The resource consumption or externalities embodied in this other consumption is the indirect effect. Although a persuasive view has prevailed that indirect effects with respect to energy and greenhouse emissions should be very small due to energy directly comprising only a small component of household expenditure, this view is gradually being eroded. Many recent studies based on life-cycle analysis show the energy consumed indirectly by households is often higher than consumed directly through electricity, gas, and motor fuel, and is a growing proportion. This is evident in the results of recent studies that indicate indirect effects from household conservation can range from 10% to 200% depending on the scenario, with higher indirect rebounds from diet changes aiming to reduce food miles. =Economy wide effects= Even if the direct and indirect rebound effects add up to less than 100%, technological improvements that increase efficiency may still result in economy-wide effects that results in increased resource use for the economy as a whole. In particular, this would happen if increased resource efficiency enables an expansion of production in the economy, and an increase in the rate of economic growth. For example, for the case of energy use, more efficient technology is equivalent to a lower price for energy resources. It is well known that changes in energy costs have a large impact on economic growth rates. In the 1970s, sharp increases in petroleum prices led to stagflation (recession and inflation) in the developed countries, whereas in the 1990s lower petroleum prices contributed to higher economic growth. An improvement in energy efficiency has the same effect as lower fuel prices, and leads to faster economic growth. Economists generally believe that especially for the case of energy use, more efficient technologies will lead to increased use, because of this growth effect. To model the scale of this effect, economists use computational general equilibrium (CGE) models. While CGE methodology is by no means perfect, results indicate that economy-wide rebound effects are likely to be very high, with estimates above 100% being rather common. One simple CGE model has been made available online for use by economists. =Income level variation= Research has shown that the direct rebound effects for energy services is lower at high income levels, due to less price sensitivity. Studies have found that own-price elasticity of gas consumption by UK households was two times greater for households in the lowest income decile when compared to the highest decile. Studies have also observed higher rebounds in low-income houses for improvements in heating technology. Evaluation methods have also been used to assess the scale of rebound effects from efficient heating installations in lower income homes in the United Kingdom. This research found that direct effects are close to 100% in many cases. High income households in developed countries are likely to set the temperature at the optimum comfort level, regardless of the cost ‚Äì therefore any cost reduction does not result in increased heating, for it was already optimal. But low-income households are more price sensitive, and have made thermal sacrifices due to the cost of heating. In this case, a high direct rebound is likely. This analogy can be extended to most household energy consumption. The size of the rebound effect is likely to be higher in developing countries according to macro-level assessments and case studies. One case study was undertaken in rural India to evaluate the impact of an alternative energy scheme. Households were given solar powered lighting in an attempt to reduce the use of kerosene for lighting to zero except for seasons with insufficient sunshine. The scheme was also designed to encourage a future willingness to pay for efficient lighting. The results were surprising, with high direct rebounds between 50 and 80%, and total direct and indirect rebound above 100%. Because the new lighting source was essentially zero cost, operating hours for lighting went up from an average of 2 to 6 per day, with new lighting consisting of a combination of both the no-cost solar lamps and also kerosene lamps. Also, more cooking was undertaken which enabled an increased trade of food with neighboring villages. =Rebounds with respect to time= The individual opportunity of cost is an often overlooked cause of the rebound effect. Just as improved workplace tools result in an increased expectation of productivity, so does the increased availability of time result in an increase in demand for a service. Research articles often examine increasingly convenient and more rapid modes of transportation to determine the rebound effect in energy demand. Because time cost forms a major part of the total cost of commuter transport, rapid modes will reduce real costs, but will also encourage longer commuting distances which will in turn increase energy consumption. While important, it is almost impossible to estimate empirically the scale of such effects due to the subjective nature of the value of time. Time saved can either be used towards additional work or leisure which may have differing degrees of rebound effect. Labor time saved at work due to the increased labour productivity is likely to be spent on further labor time at higher productive rates. For leisure time saving, this may simply encourage people to diversify their leisure interests to fill their generally fixed period of leisure time. Suggested solutions In order to ensure that efficiency enhancing technological improvements actually reduce fuel use, the ecological economists Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be \\"taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation. Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in natural capital rehabilitation.\\" This can be achieved through, for example, the imposition of a green tax, a cap and trade program, higher fuel taxes or the proposed \\"restore\\" approach where part of the savings is directed back to the resource. Policies can also directly address projected yearly consumption of energy rather than device efficiency, especially for systems where the use can be accurately projected, such as street lighting.

The plant is native to Eastern Asia, including eastern China. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine. This species is also more frequently cited by Asian studies by its synonym, Drynaria fortunei; however, this is an illegitimate name, the correct name in the genus Drynaria being Drynaria roosii. Description Aglaomorpha fortunei is an epiphytic (growing on trees) or epipetric (growing on rocks) plant. Like other species of Aglaomorpha, they possess two frond types - a fertile foliage frond and a sterile nest frond. Sterile nest fronds are rounded shallowly-lobed reddish- brown fronds overlapping each other. They bear no sori and form a 'basket' characteristic of the genus. The fertile fronds are larger and deeply lobed. They bear 1 to 3 sori arranged on both sides of the central rib. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1856 as Polypodium fortunei, with the name attributed to Gustav Kunze. In 1857, J. Smith transferred the species to the genus Drynaria, using the name \\"Drynaria fortunei\\". However, although widely used, this is an illegitimate name, because it had been published in 1855 for a different species. In 1992, Toshiyuki Nakaike published the replacement name, Drynaria roosii, which is the correct name for the species if placed in the genus Drynaria. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the genus Aglaomorpha is placed in the subfamily Drynarioideae of the family Polypodiaceae. Medicinal uses Preparations from the rhizomes of Aglaomorpha fortunei are used in traditional herbal medicine for aiding in the healing of bone fractures and for treating rheumatoid arthritis.  Pharmacological study  Modern studies of Aglaomorpha fortunei have identified in vitro effects on isolated bone cells. Flavan-3-ols and propelargonidins can be isolated from the rhizomes.Proliferative effects of flavan-3-ols and propelargonidins from rhizomes of Drynaria fortunei on MCF-7 and osteoblastic cells.

She was the daughter of the economist and statistician Arthur Bowley. After her BSc and PhD (1936) at the London School of Economics she was first appointed to a lectureship at the Dundee School of Economics in 1938. After government service during World War II she was appointed to a lectureship at University College, London in 1947, and became successively Reader and Professor of Economics. She retired in 1975. Her main contributions were in the field of the history of economic thought. Her 1937 study on Nassau Senior, Nassau Senior and Classical Economics is to date the most important source on this relatively forgotten and often misunderstood member of the Classical school. She suggests that there were actually two different strands of value theory in Classical economics: one based on the labour theory of value as propagated by the Ricardians, and a subjective approach espoused by Lauderdale, Senior and others. In the collection of studies that was published in 1973, she appears to have moved to the position that both sides had actually more common features than she had previously thought. Apart from her work in the history of economics, Marian Bowley also made important contributions to the understanding of the building industries.

Plot summary Elizabeth, the titular naughtiest girl, is chosen as a class monitor at her boarding school Whyteleafe school. New characters ;Julian Holland He is a chap with a 'devil-may-care' attitude. He Seas marvellous brains which he uses to invent jokes and tricks. He is also one of Elizabeth's best friends. He doesn't want to work and achieve academic success at first but in the end he suddenly begins to work harder than ever before. This sudden change is due to his mother recovering from an illness. He has green eyes and black hair. ;Arabella Buckley Arabella is an extremely spoiled, extremely rich girl who comes to stay at Elizabeth's during the holidays. Far more spoiled than Elizabeth was before Whyteleafe \\"cured\\" her of her naughtiness, Arabella seems to be obsessed with airs and graces and personal appearance. When she learns about how Whyteleafe is run so fairly because the children themselves run it, Arabella is mortified, especially by the rule that the children put all their money into the school funds and get an equal share of pocket-money. Despite her obsession with manners and proper behaviour, Arabella willingly breaks any rule which stops her from having her own way, from withholding a whole pound (pre-decimal) from the money-box, to organising a midnight feast for her birthday. She and Elizabeth do not get on from the start, especially when Arabella finds out that Elizabeth is her monitor and in charge of her. In the end though, once Elizabeth has redeemed herself by saving Col. Helston's young boy from drowning and asked for the whole school to go to the fair as a reward, even Arabella is happy to have Elizabeth as her Monitor once more. ;Martin Follett Martin is another new pupil at Whyteleafe. His eyes are described as being wide and innocent, but set \\"a little close together\\" (one recurring and controversial theme of Blyton is to categorise villains by appearance). He is kind and generous and appears to help when pupils' property goes missing, by giving them money or sweets apparently of his own. But other than for his kindness he is apparently overlooked by the other pupils and does not seem to have any friends. Much later on it turns out that Martin is a thief who takes people's property in order to give to others, which he describes as \\"like what Robin Hood did\\". Disgusted by his confession, Elizabeth tells him he is not fit to be at Whyteleafe. However, horrified by Julian's mother's illness and his planting evidence on Julian to make him take the blame, Martin stands up and confesses at the following Meeting. He is forgiven, told to apologise to Julian for planting evidence on him, and to pay back all that he had taken from the other children. Rosemary decides to be his friend, saying \\"he'll need a friend\\" after all he's confessed.

It is part of the women in prison cycle of violent sexploitation films that flourished in the 1970s and early 1980s. When originally submitted for release in 1976, the British Board of Film Classification rejected it. It was only passed the following year after extensive cuts. Plot Cult director Jes√∫s Franco's Swiss-West German production is a women's prison tale, with Lina Romay as Maria who is jailed after killing her father, played by director Jes√∫s Franco, who tries to rape her. Lesbian wardens, torture, nudity, sex, insanity, conspiracy and a downbeat twist ending round out the formula. The women's prison, based on an isolated island, is run by a man who impersonates a doctor, Carlos Costa. In fact, he is a killer who murdered the actual doctor of that name, whose name he then assumed. Assisting him is a monocled lesbian woman known only as The Wardress who regulates the prison with an iron fist. The Wardress reads Nazi volumes such as Albert Speer's history of the Third Reich as leisure reading. She wears jackboots and tight shorts under a white shirt in some scenes. In other scenes she wears a see-through black sheer fabric top. Due to the practice of placing prisoners in isolation and torturing them (for example, via chaining them naked to a wall just out of reach of food, or placing them naked on a wire-frame bed where they receive electric shocks), several prisoners in the past have died. The current authorities in charge of the prison have concealed this by claiming these prisoners died of heart failure; but they are reaching the point where any more reported 'heart failures' will appear suspicious to the authorities on the mainland.

The plot follows an ineffectual cell of underground terrorists who plan to kidnap an industrialist. Plot P.J. Lurz, an industrialist with an office in a Berlin high-rise, informs his American headquarters that the company has difficulty selling its security-related computer systems to the West German government in Bonn. Nevertheless, Lurz has hatched a secret plan to boost sales. Meanwhile, Susanne, Lurz's secretary, receives a phone call with the message: The world as will and idea. This is a code phrase among a secret group of thirty-something middle-class leftists and would-be terrorists to which she belongs. The phrase has been taken from the central work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation. With these words, Susanne sets an ambiguous covert plot into motion, alerting the members of the terrorist cell of an upcoming meeting. They are: August Brem, the ringleader; Susanne's composer husband Edgar; feminist history professor Hilde Krieger; Petra Vielhabor, a housewife who is constantly arguing with her banker husband Hans; and Rudolf Mann, a clerk in a record store. P.J. Lurz is informed by Gerhard Gast, the inspector-general of the police, that he is being watched and is under police protection. Gast has also arrived to pick up Susanne, his daughter-in-law. En route to their home, Susanne and Gerhard stop at a hotel room and have sex. They have been carrying on an affair with sado-masochistic undertones. The Gast family has dinner together: Gerhardt, Susanne, her husband Edgar, the caustic grandfather, the delusional pianist grandmother and the young couple's small son. During dinner Grandpa Gast tells Edgar that every generation needs a war. The terrorists gather at Rudolf's large apartment, but August is annoyed by the presence of Rudolf's roommate Ilse Hoffman, a drug addict. August sees her as a threat to their secret activities. Bored and with not much to do, the group spend their time playing Monopoly. They eagerly await the arrival of a new contact. His name is Paul; he arrives from training camps in Africa where he has gained experience. Paul is assigned to live with Hilde. He rapes her, however by the following day they have become a couple. August Brem, the leader among the terrorists, is in fact a double agent. He is secretly in contact with Lurz, who wants to boost sales of his security computers by financing the terrorist group. Rudolf's apartment serves as the terrorist headquarters and meeting point. Claiming domestic abuse, Petra leaves her husband and decides to stay with Rudolf. The group of terrorists is completed with the arrival of two friends of Ilse. One is her former boyfriend, Franz Walsh, a beefy black German who is an explosives expert recently discharged from the military. The other is his friend Bernhard von Stein, an aristocrat whose fondness for the works of Bakunin makes him the object of jokes. Franz fails to find a job but reconnects with his drug addict girlfriend Ilse. Times are tense and get even worse when Paul is gunned down by the authorities at a restaurant. Edgar witnesses his death and sees his father, Officer Gast, at the scene. Paul's death scares the members of his gang. In order to finance their activities, Petra and some of the other terrorists rob the very bank in which Petra's husband works. While they are escaping, Petra shoots and kills her husband. They frantically change their looks and names and flee from their homes. August gives out paper squares to the group. Some have a mark and some don't. Petra, Rudolf and Hilde get the marks and have to break into an office at night in order to steal the new identities. Rudolf is so scared that he pees in his pants and the others laugh at him. The joke is short-lived because Franz finds Ilse dead of a drug overdose. Bernhard is interrogated by Officer Gast as to their whereabouts. Bernhard genuinely does not know but gets curious and follows August undetected. He sees Lurz give money to August in order to finance the terrorist activities. After Paul's death, the terrorists believe that there is a traitor among them. August makes the others think that it was Franz. August sets up Franz by telling him where Ilse is buried. He then calls the authorities and gets him killed. August also does the same to Petra when she is instructed to place a bomb and gets intercepted and killed by the police. Bernhard is caught by Officer Gast at the cemetery when he tries to warn Franz that it is a set-up and tells him not to go to Ilse's grave. Bernhard tells Officer Gast what he saw at the Japanese restaurant; after they argue, Bernhard falls down a long flight of stairs and is killed. The remaining terrorists, taking advantage of the carnival season to wear elaborate costumes as disguises, kidnap P.J. Lurz. He is videotaped in a basement. He still believes that all is part of his secret plan and smiles to the camera. Cast * Eddie Constantine as P.J.

The large cast mainly comprised actors from Fassbinder's regular troupe: Hanna Schygulla, Margit Carstensen, Volker Spengler, Harry Baer and G√ºnther Kaufmann among others. It also includes two international stars: Eddie Constantine, who had worked with Fassbinder earlier in the director's career, and Bulle Ogier, who did not speak German. Her dialogue was translated to her native French by Juliane Lorenz who worked as assistant director and editor, also having a cameo role as a job counselor. Some of the actors also worked behind the scenes: Harry Baer was executive producer, Ra√∫l Gimenez was production designer and Volker Spengler was the art director. Reception The Third Generation premiered on 13 May 1979 at the Cannes Film Festival. It competed in the Un Certain Regard section. American and French critics praised the film as the most exciting in the festival. The French daily Le Figaro called it: \\"An effective, cinematic exercise in style and one of the most frightening political films\\". The film was released in West Germany in September 1979. It was received without enthusiasm. Some critics praised the film's mordant political humor, but mostly it received negative reviews. A critic called it as crazy as teaming Jerry Lewis with Robert Bresson. The political theme of the film aroused controversy. At a screening in Hamburg the projectionist was beaten unconscious, while in Frankfurt an incensed mob threw acid at the screen. There were also death threats. However, The Third Generation is now considered by film critics to be one of Fassbinder's best films. At the Rotten Tomatoes website it has an 83% \\"Fresh\\" rating.

Introduced as the Agusta A119 Koala prior to the Agusta- Westland merger, it is targeted at operators favoring lower running costs of a single-engine aircraft over redundancy of a twin. Development The A119 designation was first applied to a proposed 11-seat stretched version of the A109 in the 1970s; however this concept did not emerge and no such rotorcraft actually built. The helicopter that was eventually to enter production as the A119 was conceived in 1994, as Agusta was recovering from a period of financial woes that had nearly put the company out of business. In February 1995, the second of two prototypes conducted its first flight. The first prototype was used for static tests. Civil certification was originally anticipated in 1997, this deadline was missed allegedly due to multiple issues such as personnel problems, the need to concentrate resources on the development of the A109 Power, and further development to increase the aircraft's performance to meet customer expectations.Gray 2000, p. 40. By way of a solution to the latter concern, the decision was taken to change the A119's powerplant. The prototypes were originally fitted with Turbom√©ca Arriel 2K1 turboshafts, however the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6B was chosen in its place. In 1998, the prototypes were remanufactured with this engine, and assigned new serial numbers. Certification was now expected by the fourth quarter of that year, but this date slipped to July 1999, and it was eventually December before Italian RAI certification was awarded. US FAA certification was awarded in February the following year. Customer deliveries began soon thereafter, the first commercial example was delivered to Australian logistics company Linfox (serial 14007, registration VH-FOX). In April 2007, the AW119Ke (Ke standing for Koala Enhanced) was formally unveiled at Heli-Expo; changes included modified rotor blade design and a higher rotor rpm, increasing both payload and hot-and-high performance, cabin flexibility was also improved.\\"Rotorcraft Report: AgustaWestland Unveils Enhanced Version of AW119.\\" Rotor&Wing;, 1 April 2007.

During January 2010, a partnership agreement was signed between Indian conglomerate Tata Sons and AgustaWestland as the foundations for a new joint venture, Indian Rotorcraft. At the time, India was viewed by helicopter manufacturers as one of the biggest potential growth markets. During March 2012, Indian Rotorcraft broke ground on a 40,000m2 new facility adjacent to Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, Hyderabad, India; The first helicopters to be manufactured by the joint venture is slated to be the AgustaWestland AW119Ke; other types, such as the AgustaWestland AW101, are likely to follow in the future. During summer 2015, it was reported that further delays to starting assembly in India were likely as the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), an Indian government agency, repeatedly deferred a pending decision. During May 2016, another pending ruling by the FIPB was deferred without any stated reason; allegedly, the FIPB is liaising with the Indian Ministry of Defence on the matter.

The design of the rotorcraft is derived from Agusta's earlier and highly successful A109 helicopter, differing primarily by being equipped with a single engine (as the A109 was originally designed), a Pratt & Whitney PT6B-37A turboshaft engine, and using fixed skids in place of the A109's retractable wheeled landing gear arrangement.\\"AW119Kx.\\" Finmeccanica, Retrieved: 13 February 2016. The AW119 shares the same cockpit and cabin of the AW109, along with commonality with various other systems, while costing roughly half of the latter's price tag. According to Flight International, the AW119 is competitively priced and provides good levels of accessibility, maintainability, comfort, noise levels, and speed.Gray 2000, p. 43. The AW119 employs a four-bladed fully articulated main rotor; the composite rotor blades are designed to produce maximum lift with minimum noise, and feature tip caps to reduce noise and elastomeric bearings with no lubrication requirements. Aluminium honeycomb structural panels are used throughout the airframe, which absorb both noise and vibration, thus requiring no additional vibration absorption systems to be employed.Gray 2000, pp. 40-41. The PT6B-37A powerplant of the AW119, located in the same area as the AW109's engines, is capable of providing high power margins along with generous speeds and endurance.Gray 2000, p. 41. According to AgustaWestland, the AW119 retains the system redundancy of dual engine helicopters, such as the hydraulics and the dual independent stability augmentation systems. The gearbox has a 30-minute dry run capability. The AW119 Koala has been used for various roles, including utility, emergency medical services (EMS), offshore, law enforcement, and executive transport. A key selling point of the type is its wide-body fuselage, which allows for up to seven passengers to be seated in a three-abreast configuration in the cabin; for the EMS mission, up to two litters along with medical attendants and full emergency medical equipment suite can be accommodated, whereas most similar-sized helicopters can only carry one. The unobstructed cabin area and separate baggage compartment can be rapidly reconfigured to suit a range of different missions and roles. Several different cabin interiors may be adopted to accommodate different missions and operations, such as executive/VIP, EMS, and utility options; the cockpit can also be isolated from the cabin. The AW119 has been promoted as possessing the largest cabin in its class; the reported cabin volume is approximately 30% greater than other rotorcraft in its class. AW119 Koala Ke at Wagga Wagga Airport, 2012 A wide range of avionics have been integrated upon the AW119, which are typically housed within the rotorcraft's nose.Gray 2000, p. 42. Initial production models featured conventional flight instruments; the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit is integrated on the newer AW119Kx variant, which is claimed to improve situational awareness, reduce pilot workload, and increase safety. Primary flight and other key information is displayed to the pilots upon two large 10.4 inch multi-function displays in the cockpit; an independently powered stand-by display is also present in case of system failure. Other avionics used include a 3-axis aircraft flight control system (AFCS), Synthetic Vision System (SVS), Highway In The Sky (HITS) depiction, moving map display, radio altimeter, VOR/ILS/GPS/WAAS navigation, Aural Warning Generator, and embedded Helicopter Terrain Avoidance Warning System (HTAWS). A variety of equipment can be equipped, dependent on operator choice and role; these include an external hoist, dual cargo hook, dual flight controls, baggage compartment extension, snow skis, windshield wipers, rotor brake, multi-band radios, active noise reduction headsets, soundproofing, oxygen systems, loud speakers, search lights, retractable landing light, emergency floatation equipment, reinforced windshield, wire strike protection system, rappelling kit, fire fighting belly tank, and a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera. Three fuel tanks, located behind the rear seats in the cabin, are installed as standard; up to two additional optional tanks can be fitted for a total of five, providing a flight endurance of nearly six hours.

The Austrian colonization of the Nicobar Islands (, renamed to the Theresia Islands [Theresia-Inseln]) involved a series of three separate attempts to colonize and settle the Nicobar Islands by the Habsburg Monarchy, and later the Austrian Empire. During the period of Austrian colonization, the Nicobar Islands were previously colonized by the Danish in 1756, but were abandoned due to multiple outbreaks of malaria. The Danes though still laid formal claim to the islands. The first attempt was the only time where the island chain was successfully colonized by the Austrians.Steger, Philipp (2005). \\"The Nicobar Islands: Linking Past and Future\\". University of Vienna. Archived from the original on 2005. Retrieved 16 December 2018. The second attempt was canceled; and the third attempt, in 1886, was abandoned due to prior colonization by the British in 1868.  Previous colonization by the Danish  The Nicobar Islands were officially colonized by the Danish on 1 January 1756. Denmark owned a significant port in India, Tranquebar, and decided to colonize the islands, citing the lack of native resistance, the ease of access, and relative vicinity to Tranquebar. In December 1756, the Danish stylized the islands Frederick's Islands (), which had its name taken from the then-King of Denmark, Frederick V. Within a few months of colonization, the island of Nancowry was settled, and the colony contracted malaria for the first time. The mosquito borne disease spread island-to-island, until it eventually hit the Danish colonists so hard, that the remaining settlers, including the head of the colony, were able to sail back to Tranquebar in March 1760. Another expedition was made in 1768, again started in Nancowry, but within less than 9 years that colony had disappeared as well.Lowis,R. F. (1912) The Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Part I. Report. Part II. Tables.Temple, R. C. (1903) The Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Report on the Census. Background & Austrian colonization The origins of colonization can be traced back to Empress Maria Theresa and Emperor Joseph II, who were both appealed by William Bolts. Bolts had been previously active in the British East India Company but had been convicted for trading in opium and was dismissed. In 1774, he traveled to Vienna to convince the inexperienced Austria of the feasibility of trade between Trieste and the Far East. Bolts was well received by the Austrian court, and was given a ten-year charter allowing him to trade under the Austrians through their Adriatic ports to Persia, India, China, and Africa.Octroi de Sa Majest√© l‚ÄôImperatrice Reine Apostolique, accord√© au Sieur Guillaume Bolts, √† Vienne le 5 Juin 1775\\", Guillaume Bolts, Recueil de pi√®ces authentiques, relatives aux affaires de la ci-devant Soci√©t√© imp√©riale asiatique de Trieste, g√©r√©es √† Anvers, Antwerp, 1787, pp.45‚Äì49 Bolts, who was then at the court of the Nawab of Mysore,Walter Markov, \\"La Compagnia Asiatica di Trieste\\", Studi Storici, vol.2, no.1, 1961, p.14. directed the Joseph und Theresia to sail to the Nicobar's. In June 1778, the Joseph und Theresia docked on the island of Nancowry. On 12 July, the Nicobarese natives signed a document that ceded all twenty-four islands to Austria. The Austrian flag was then raised on a nearby hill; and 6 men, besides the slaves, cattle, and arms, were left behind to start the new Austrian colony.Franz von Pollack-Parnau, \\"Eine √∂sterreich-ostindische Handelskompanie, 1775‚Äì1785: Beitrag zur √∂sterreichische Wirtschaftsgeschichte unter Maria Theresia und Joseph II\\", Vierteljahrsschrift f√ºr Sozial- und Wirtschaftsgesichte, Beiheft 12, Stuttgart, 1927, S.45‚Äì47.

In 1781, the colonists complained about a lack of drinking water and food, but Vienna took no notice and left its outpost to its fate. The colonists continued on, and managed successfully until Gottfried Stahl, leader of the colonization effort, died in 1783. After Stahl's death, the remaining colonists decided to abandon the islands in 1785. In addition to Stahl's death, the Danish decided to send a warship from Tranquebar in an attempt to forcefully remove the Austrians from Nancowry.Walter Markov, \\"L'expansion autrichienne outre-mer et les int√©r√™ts portugaises 1777‚Äì81\\", Congresso Internacional de Hist√≥ria dos Descobrimentos, Actas, Volume V, II parte, Lisboa, 1961, pp.281‚Äì291. The SMS Novara  Novara Expedition of 1858  Motivated by an urge to explore, Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria in 1857 sent the frigate \\"SMS Novara\\" on a trip of scientific circumnavigation around the globe. On board was a team of researchers from the Austrian Academy of Sciences, which also received the additional task of looking out for possible locations for a penal colony. In February 1858, the SMS Novara reached the island of Car Nicobar, the northernmost island of the chain. The Austrian team sailed around the islands of Nancowry and Kamorta but did not try to occupy them. The leader of the group, ethnologist Karl von Scherzer, encouraged the team to explore for artifacts present of the islands. In totality, the researchers acquired over 400 native artifacts from Nancowry and Kamorta; von Scherzer then began promoting the idea of recolonization. The Austrian government ruled against the notion of recolonization, which ended all serious negations of colonization at the time. If von Scherzer's idea had been accepted by the Austrian government, the colonization would have been most likely uncontested. The Danish removed all settlements from the Nicobar Islands, and relinquished sovereignty of the islands in 1848. In addition, the Austrians would have beaten out the British by ten years if they had put von Scherzer's recommendations in action. Aurora Expedition In 1886, the Austrian corvette, SMS Aurora, anchored in the harbor of Nancowry before continuing her voyage to the Far East. When docking at Nancowry for the third time, the Austrians realized the British had already settled the islands. In 1868, the British officially purchased the rights to all twenty-four of the Nicobar Islands from the Danish government. After discovering this, there were no further plans for recolonization.

It is about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and south-east of the centre of the city of Mount Gambier. The name was approved in 1942 by the Nomenclature Committee for a private sub-division in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Caroline. The sub-division was approved at some time during the 1940s with one source stating that it occurred in 1943 while another states the year of approval was 1947. Prior to the subdivision it was known as 'Donovan's Landing'. Boundaries were created on 31 October 1996 for the \\"long established name\\" which was derived from the name of the sub-division rather from the name 'Donovan's Landing'. Donovans consists of land adjoining the border with the state of Victoria which includes a loop of the Glenelg River. A settlement is located on the west side of the river while the land on the east side of the river has been declared as the protected area known as the Lower Glenelg River Conservation Park. It was described in 1926 by the newspaper, The Register, as follows: > With his customary zeal our guide secured a number of motor vehicles to > convey us to a point on the Glenelg River called Donovan's... The scenery in > the vicinity of this river is very fine.

It is bounded by West 40th Street on the south, West 54th Street on the north, Sixth Avenue on the east and Eighth Avenue on the west, and includes Times Square. The Great White Way is the name given to the section of Broadway which runs through the Theater District. It also contains recording studios, record label offices, theatrical agencies, television studios, restaurants, Duffy Square, Shubert Alley, the Brill Building, a Ripley's Believe It or Not! Odditorium, and Madame Tussauds New York. Boundaries The City of New York defines the subdistrict for zoning purposes to extend from 40th Street to 57th Street and from Sixth Avenue to Eighth Avenue, with an additional area west of Eighth Avenue from 42nd Street to 45th Street.\\"Special Purpose Districts: Manhattan: Special Midtown Districts\\" on the official NYC website. Accessed: February 21, 2013 The Times Square Alliance, a Business Improvement District organization dedicated to improving the Theater District, defines the district as an irregularly shaped area within the bounding box of 40th Street, 6th Avenue, 53rd Street, and 9th Avenue.Times Square: Times Square/Theater District Dining As of 2018, the Vivian Beaumont Theater (part of Lincoln Center) is the only Broadway-class theater not located in the Theater District. History=Origins and early history= In 1836, mayor Cornelius Lawrence opened 42nd Street to encourage the city's northern expansion, saying \\"move up town and enjoy the pure, clean air\\". The Theater District began attracting theaters and restaurants after the Metropolitan Opera House moved to West 39th Street and Broadway in 1883. Oscar Hammerstein I opened his Victoria Theatre on 42nd Street in 1899. Accessibility to the Theater District improved as electrified trolley lines started in 1899, followed by the opening of the New York City Subway's first line in 1904. \\"The Great White Way\\" is a nickname for a section of Broadway in Midtown Manhattan that encompasses the Theater District. In 1880, Broadway between Union Square and Madison Square was illuminated by Brush arc lamps, making it among the first electrically lighted streets in the United States. By the 1890s, 23rd Street to 34th Street was so brightly illuminated by electrical advertising signs people began calling it \\"The Great White Way\\". As the theater district shifted uptown just before the turn of the century, the nickname stuck and became synonymous. Over the years, the district has been referred to by New Yorkers as \\"the Rialto,\\" \\"The Main Stem,\\" and \\"Broadway.\\" Around the turn of the 20th century, it was simply called \\"The Street\\". By the 1970s, 42nd Street was seedy and run-down; X-rated movie houses, peep shows, and so-called grind houses began to locate there. It was considered by some New Yorkers as a somewhat dangerous place to venture. However, in the 1990s the entire area was significantly revitalized by the city. Most of the adult theater businesses closed and an array of new theaters, multiplex movie houses, restaurants, and tourist attractions opened. In 1974, the Lyceum Theatre became the first Broadway theatre to receive the landmark status designation from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. =Joe Papp's \\"Save the Theatres\\" campaign= In the Spring of 1982, Joseph Papp, the Broadway theatrical producer, and director who had established The Public Theater, led a campaign called \\"Save the Theatres\\" in Manhattan.The name of the organization was \\"Save the Theatres, Inc., as noted in court papers. See Shubert Organization, Inc. v. Landmarks Preservation Commission of the City of New York and Save the Theatres, Inc. , Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, First Department, May 16, 1991, accessed March 10, 2013 The primary initial goal of the \\"Save the Theatres\\" effort, which was sponsored by Papp's not-for-profit group and supported by the Actors Equity union, was to save several theater buildings in the Theatre District neighborhood from their impending demolition by monied Manhattan development interests.\\"Proposal to Save Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters\\", LHP Architects, accessed March 10, 2013Corwin, Betty \\"Theatre on film and tape archive\\" , International Association of Libraries and Museums of the Performing Arts, accessed May 10, 2013 Papp provided financial resources, campaign buttons, posters, and newspaper ads for the effort; recruited a publicist and actors to promote the cause; and provided a various stage and street venues for public events in support of the campaign for saving the historic theatres. At Papp's behest, in July 1982, U.S. Representative Donald J. Mitchell of New York, and 13 co-sponsors, introduced a bill entitled \\"A bill to designate the Broadway/Times Square Theatre District in the City of New York as a national historic site\\" (). The proposed legislation, which was not enacted, would have required the Federal Government to aid financially and otherwise in preserving the district and its historic theatre houses as an official National Historic Site. The Save the Theatres campaign then turned their efforts toward supporting the establishment of the Theater District as a registered New York City historic district. In December 1983, Save the Theatres prepared \\"The Broadway Theater District, a Preservation Development and Management Plan,\\" and demanded that each theater in the district receive landmark designation. Mayor Koch ultimately responded by creating a Theater Advisory Council, that included Papp as a member, and which eventually led to the area being officially zoned as the \\"Theater Subdistrict.\\" =Theater Subdistrict zoning= In January 2001, the New York Appellate Division, First Department in Fisher v. Giuliani, partially upheld the 1998 expansion of the Theater Subdistrict zoning regulations, which added receiving sites along Eighth Avenue where development rights from the landmarked Broadway theaters could be sold. Community and civic organizations opposed the expansion of the district as it would impinge the nearby residential neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen/Clinton. The court objection, filed in 1999, did not challenge the pre-existing Theater Subdistrict itself or the original development rights zoning legislation. Under the 1998 zoning regulation, New York City also created the Theater Subdistrict Council (TSC), a not-for-profit corporation. The TSC administers the Theater Subdistrict Fund and allocates grants. The New York City Zoning Resolution for special purpose districts, as amended on April 30, 2012, contains special regulations for the Theater Subdistrict, including the transfer of development rights, incentives for the rehabilitation of existing theaters, the creation of a theater council to promote theaters, and zoning and signage for theaters, and contains a list of theaters that qualify for special provisions in the regulations. =Other nearby theater areas= The area known as Theatre Row is an area on 42nd Street from Ninth Avenue to Eleventh Avenue, which includes many Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway theaters.

The chassis was derived from the Tipo C and the engine from the 8C 2900. The 308 was engineered by Gioacchino Colombo under the control of Enzo Ferrari who was then in charge of Alfa's racing team, Alfa Corse. The car debuted at the Pau Grand Prix in 1938, where two cars were entered to race, one for Tazio Nuvolari and the other for Luigi Villoresi. Both drivers had to withdraw from competition, however Nuvolari had by then set a lap record. The next race was the Tripoli Grand Prix. The new 312 (3-litre, 12 cylinders) and 316 (3-litre, 16 cylinders) were entered, but they had engine trouble during practice and Clemente Biondetti took the start at the wheel of the 308 held in reserve. He failed to finish, while Hermann Lang, driving a Mercedes-Benz W154, was the winner. In this race, Eugenio Siena, driving a 312, was killed after hitting a wall.

It was written by Giuliani G. De Negri, Paolo Taviani, Tonino Guerra, and Vittorio Taviani. It was entered into the 1982 Cannes Film Festival where it won the Jury Special Grand Prix. The film was selected by Italy as its entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 55th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot The film opens with a mother telling her sleeping son a story from her childhood. The story recounts how wishes come true when a shooting star occurs. She proceeds to tell the story of the Italian town she once lived in. A man and his pregnant fianc√© quickly marry in the church. After their marriage, the family of the bride had a mini celebration. The film follows several inhabitants of an Italian town during the end of World War II. Defeat is certain for the German army, and the front is retreating to Germany, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. The Germans plan to blow up several buildings in the town and have told all the villagers to congregate in the town's church. Approximately half of the town decides to stay and place their trust in the church. The rest of the town dresses in dark clothing to blend in the night. The man joined the retreating group as his wife and her mother stayed in the church. They head out seeking the Americans who were rumored to be nearby, liberating towns as they come to them. The bishop wants to say mass with the townspeople in the church. He finds only two pieces of bread for communion. One of the townspeople mentions that she has a loaf of bread. The bishop asks her, and the rest of the congregation, to divide up their bread so he can bless it and use it instead of the standard host. While he is performing communion, the Fascists explode a bomb in the church, resulting in panic, people fleeing, and many casualties. One wounded girl is seen being carried outside by her mother. It was the man's wife. The bishop tries to help carry the woman but when he realises that he caused the deaths, he drops her and flees. As the mother continues to carry her, the husband returns from his group to be with his wife, but it is too late to save her. The man returns to his group and they continue their trek. They pass a field where partisans are harvesting the grain. The partisans share their complaints that they're replacing the grain stolen by the Fascists. The group had learned on the road that the partisans can help transport people safely to a city away from the Fascists. The group helps the partisans harvest grain. During the day, the group must hide from German planes that fly over at midday while they are threshing. Cecilia, who is telling this story, reveals that, at that night, the shooting stars occurred, but the people were so caught up in the pain and fear that they forgot all about it. In the afternoon of the next day, the group is ambushed by Fascists. During the ambush, the majority of the group are killed. Cecilia watches a Fascist kill her grandfather, her mother, and her father. As the Fascist comes after Cecilia, she repeats a nonsense rhyme that her mother had taught her to say whenever she is afraid. As she says the lines, an ancient warrior appears with a spear and a shield. The warrior throws the spear and pierces the Fascist's stomach. As the Fascist looks up in surprise, a line of ancient warriors appears and throw their spears, killing the Fascist. The man, Cecilia, and a few other members of the group survive the fight and continue heading to their journey. That night, Calvano, the elderly leader of the group and an older woman from the group share a room, leading them to reveal that they have had feelings for each other since they were young. The mother tells her sleeping son to remember the lines of the rhyme, then the mother is revealed to be Cecilia, the child in the story.

This new film encompasses a vision of the world. Comedy, tragedy, vaudeville, melodrama - they're all here, and inseparable...In its feeling and completeness, Shooting Stars may be close to the rank of Jean Renoir's bafflingly beautiful Grand Illusion...unreality doesn't seem divorced from experience (as it does with Fellini) - it's experience made more intense...For the Tavianis, as for Cecilia, the search for the American liberators is the time of their lives. For an American audience, the film stirs warm but tormenting memories of a time when we were beloved and were a hopeful people.\\"Pauline Kael, review reprinted in Taking It All In, pp. 446‚Äì451 In July 2018, it was selected to be screened in the Venice Classics section at the 75th Venice International Film Festival.

It is about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and south-east of the city centre of Mount Gambier. Wye is mentioned as early as 1869 when it was reported to be the rumoured name of a township which was derived from the River Wye in England and Wales to be laid out by government surveyors in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Caroline. A school operated there between the years 1880 and 1882. The name is also reported as being originally used for a private sub-division within the Hundred of Caroline which purchased in 1895 by Charles John Edwards. However the original allotments were too small and the land was subjected to further sub-division by Edwards‚Äô daughter, Elizabeth Hunt and by David Skene in 1927. Boundaries were created on 31 October 1996 for the \\"long established name\\" which is reported as being derived from the sub-division rather the above-mentioned river. The locality's boundaries include the former Green Point Shack Area. A request from postal authorities for the name to be altered due to its similarity to Rye in the state of Victoria was not acted on by the relevant government agency. Wye consists of land located along the continental coastline extending from the Green Point Road in the west and the state border in the east. The Glenelg River Road passes from Mount Gambier to the north through the locality to the town centre of Nelson in Victoria to the east. The coastline overlooks Discovery Bay and the eastern part of a subsidiary bay known as Brown Bay located to the west of the headland of Green Point and on the west side of the locality. The majority land use within the locality is agriculture with a strip of land along the coastline being zoned for conservation purposes which includes the protected area known as the Piccaninnie Ponds Conservation Park. The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Wye had a population of 92 people.

Plot Adam, a medical student, is lured to a cabin far from civilization where he volunteers to be repeatedly killed and reanimated by Dr. Franklin Vick, through use of a mysterious serum. While \\"Subject Two\\" as he is initially successful, he begins to experience violent seizures and excruciating pain, begging Vick to kill him or committing suicide several times. Adam eventually gains complete immortality and near instantaneous regeneration, but as a consequence he loses the very sense of being alive; he can no longer feel things (including pain) and no longer can have emotions. His eyes turn snow white, and, to compensate for the gradual loss of his sense of self, he becomes violent and depressed, going so far as to kill a hunter that accidentally shoots him rather than risk him exposing the project. Eventually the student leaves Vick, only to become a walking ghost doomed to walk the earth for eternity. After returning home, \\"Vick\\" finds the real Dr. Franklin Vick, and it is revealed that the doctor for the course of the entire movie was his assistant, Subject One. Thinking that he had accidentally killed Dr. Vick, Subject One assumed his identity to continue the work, but finds that the serum was initially perfect, and it was only his tampering that gradually changed Adam. Dr. Vick scolds him before strangling him in a similar fashion to Adam, and thus begins the experiment cycle over again. It carries several obvious homages to Frankenstein but explores more the emotional effects of death and pseudo-life.

Although it is fiction, the novel was based on Barbusse's experiences as a French soldier on the Western Front. Summary and style The novel takes the form of journal-like anecdotes which the unnamed narrator claims to be writing to record his time in the war. It follows a squad of French volunteer soldiers on the Western front in France after the German invasion. The book opens and ends with broad visions shared by multiple characters but beyond these the action of the novel takes place in occupied France. The anecdotes are episodic, each with a chapter title. The best-known chapter, \\"The Fire\\" (Le feu) shares the French-language title of the book. It describes a trench assault from the Allied (French) trench across No-Man's Land into the German trench. In contrast to many war novels which came before it, Under Fire describes war in gritty and brutal realism. It is noted for its realistic descriptions of death in war and the squalid trench conditions. Publication and reception Barbusse wrote Le feu while he was a serving soldier. He claimed to have taken notes for the novel while still in the trenches; after being injured and reassigned from the front, he wrote and published the novel while working at the War Office in 1916. Critical reception of the book was mixed at its publication. Its unique position of being published before the end of the war -- the so-called \\"war book boom\\" took place only in the 1920s -- led to its being widely read. Jacques Bertillon referred to Barbusse as a \\"moral witness [...] with a story to tell and re-tell.\\" Like many war novels, Under Fire was criticised for fictionalizing details of the war. In 1929, Jean Norton Cru, who was commissioned to critique French literature of World War I, called Under Fire \\"a concoction of truth, half-truth, and total falsehood.\\" The novel was first published in French in December 1916. It was translated into English by William Fitzwater Wray and published in June 1917 by J. M. Dent & Sons. In 2003, Penguin Press published a new translation by Robin Buss with an introduction by the American historian Jay Winter.

She was the first woman to gain a First Class degree in Classics at the University of Oxford, and was instrumental in securing the admission of women as full members of the university in 1920. Early life and education  Emily Penrose was the second of five siblings, and oldest daughter of Francis Cramer Penrose, and his wife Harriette Gibbes, the daughter of Francis Gibbes, a surgeon of Harewood. Her paternal grandmother was Mrs MarkhamProfile, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; accessed 21 June 2011.. Penrose studied in a private school in Wimbledon before studying languages in Versailles, Paris, Dresden and Berlin. She also trained as an artist with her father; a watercolour of the Parthenon attributed to her is in the collection of the British Museum. She lived with her family in Athens during 1886-87 while her father was director of the British School at Athens, during which time she kept a diary detailing her life in Athens and travels around Greece, and learned modern Greek. Her diary records her participation in the academic and social life of Athens, especially that of the foreign archaeological schools (which included the British School, the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, the German Archaeological Institute at Athens, and the French School at Athens). The British School also has at least one watercolour painting probably by her. Penrose was educated at Somerville College at the University of Oxford, where she started as a scholar of Greats (Classics) in 1889; this involved her learning both Latin and ancient Greek from scratch. At the time, Honour Moderations for Classics were not open to women, so she moved straight to Finals without taking any other examinations during her course of study. She chose to specialise in archaeology after her experiences in Athens, and in 1892 became the first woman to gain a First in Greats (Classics). As women were not able to gain a degree from the University of Oxford at that time, she presented herself for an ad eundem University of Dublin MA in 1904. Career Penrose taught for a short time as an extension lecturer in Oxford and London before being appointed as Professor in Ancient History and Principal of Bedford College from 1893-1898. She was subsequently the second Principal of Royal Holloway College (RHC) from 1898-1907 where she succeeded Matilda Ellen Bishop. Bishop's resignation followed disagreement about Sunday Services with the governors. During Penrose's time as the Principal at the college, the social life developed as the numbers of students increased, even though Penrose had an unexpected weakness of shyness. However, in her time at the college she set it on the path which it successfully followed. She was instrumental in gaining the college admission to the newly formed University of London in 1900. This change led to increasing numbers of students studying for and being awarded London degrees, and a movement away from studying Oxford courses (where the female students at Royal Holloway were not allowed to receive degrees, but instead received only a notification that they had completed the class).. In her final year as Principal at Royal Holloway, eight of the students were awarded first class University of London degrees Penrose was also the Chairman of the University of London Classical board and a member of the senate council. Penrose was followed at Royal Holloway by Ellen Charlotte Higgins. On the death of the previous Principal, Agnes Catherine Maitland, Somerville college council invited Penrose to take the post as Principal of Somerville College, Oxford (1907 - 1926). In 1894 Somerville College had become the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of 'college' and the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, the first to set an entrance examination, and the first to build a library. In the beginning Penrose also served as the tutor for Greats in Classics, but eventually was forced by her administrative load to stop tutoring and focus on her work as college principal. Penrose was closely involved in the establishment of a university delegacy for women students in 1910, on which she served as an elected member, which led ten years later to the admission of women to full membership of the university. By 1914, under her influence, Somerville had stopped admitting students to the college who would not take the degree course, in order to build up a cohort of women students who were clearly qualified to receive degrees. Penrose also served on numerous other committees, including becoming the statutory commissioner for the University of Oxford in 1923. Penrose was a leader at the time that women secured admission first to Oxford university lectures, then to examinations, and finally, in 1920, to university membership._____, \\"Degrees conferred at Oxford\\". Yorkshire Post, 15 October 1920. 5. During her time as Principal of Somerville, Penrose also presided over many changes, including plans for new buildings, major constitutional changes and temporary accommodation of the college in Oriel College during World War I. On her retirement in 1926, she was given a large sum as a farewell present, which she returned to the College to establish a student loan fund. She moved to London after her retirement, later moving to Bournemouth on the outbreak of World War II, where she died on 26 January 1942. Legacy The success of the 1920 campaign to admit women as full members of the University of Oxford owed much to the diplomatic skills and academic reputation of Penrose. On her retirement in 1926, Penrose was awarded an honorary Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) by Oxford, the second woman given this title after Queen Mary; Sheffield University also awarded her an honorary LLD. In 1927 she was awarded a DBE for her work for education and made the first Honorary Fellow of Somerville College. Penrose was the subject of numerous photographs and portraits, including by Francis William Helps, Philip Alexius de Laszlo, and the Rhomaides Brothers.

Background  The first version of the Constitution included a census power. Its inclusion was not controversial. It can be seen as a class of \\"nationhood powers\\" which reflected basic powers that a \\"nation\\" was viewed with possessing (similar nationhood powers would include the currency power, the weights and measures power, and the postal power). Australian colonies had collected statistics from settlement. The first simultaneous census was held across Australia in 1881 as part of the Census of the British Empire. In December 1905 the Commonwealth Government passed the Census and Statistics Act 1905. The first Commonwealth Census after federation was held in 1911 (although a simultaneous state census was held in 1901). The Australian Bureau of Statistics is the Commonwealth agency responsible for census and statistics.  Related Constitution sections  Section 24 says the number of members in the House of Representatives per state will be based on the based on quotas based on population, which will be based on \\"the latest statistics of the Commonwealth\\" (s. 24(i) and s. 24(ii)). Section 24 evinces a clear intention that the Commonwealth would use section 51(xi) to conduct census and collect information, rather than leaving the matter to the states. Section 127 stated that \\"in reckoning the numbers of the people ... aboriginal natives should not be counted.\\" This section was removed by a referendum to amend the constitution that was held in 1967. Section 127 did not use the word \\"census\\" or \\"statistics\\" ‚Äì the language of s. 51(xi). On a purposive approach, the debates at the Constitutional Conventions showed the clear purpose of section 127 was to limit section 24. Section 127 operated to prevent the number of Aboriginal Australians being used in the calculations for the number of members of the House of Representatives. Section 127 was quite a narrow provision, in that it did not use the word \\"statistics\\". Accordingly, section 51(xi) still allowed the Commonwealth had the power to collect statistics on Aboriginal people which it did, according population numbers.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. Its operational headquarters in the United Kingdom are in High Wycombe. The company was created from the merger of rivals Taylor Woodrow and George Wimpey on 3 July 2007. History=Taylor Woodrow= Taylor Woodrow was founded in 1921, by 16 year old Frank Taylor, who borrowed some money to build two houses in Blackpool. As he was too young to form his own company, his uncle Jack Woodrow lent his name to the business, and so it became Taylor, Woodrow Limited.Taylor Wimpey: Our History In the 1930s, Taylor Woodrow diversified into building temporary hospitals etc., and thereby moved into general construction. Taylor Woodrow's main operations were in general construction with Taylor Woodrow Homes only being a small part of the group: indeed, housing sales actually declined, and at the beginning of the 1980s, Taylor Woodrow Homes was still only building around 500 to 600 houses a year.Wellings, Fred: Dictionary of British Housebuilders (2006) Troubador. In January 2001, this changed as Taylor Woodrow acquired Bryant Group, a business founded in Birmingham in 1885 by Chris Bryant, for ¬£556 million and in October 2003 Taylor Woodrow acquired Wilson Connolly in a cash and shares deal worth ¬£499 million. =George Wimpey= A Taylor Wimpey development at Diglis Basin in Worcester George Wimpey was founded by George Wimpey and Walter Tomes (the latter sold out in 1893) as a stone-working partnership in 1880 in Hammersmith. George Wimpey died in 1913 at the age of 58. His family put the business up for sale in 1919. Godfrey Way Mitchell bought the firm and decided to retain the Wimpey name. George Wimpey completed its first residential development, the Greenford Park Estate, in 1928. In the 1970s, George Wimpey became the United Kingdom's largest private house builder selling 106,440 homes in the decade, and in the 1980s, George Wimpey began to reinforce Wimpey Homes as a brand, focusing on quality compact housing. Advertising, featuring the famous Wimpey cat, ensured Wimpey Homes became a household name in house building. In March 1996, George Wimpey acquired McLean Homes, a business founded in the 1934 by John McLean, from Tarmac.British home builders to swap some assets In August 2001, McAlpine Homes was acquired from Alfred McAlpine in a ¬£463 million deal and in October 2002, George Wimpey went on to acquire Laing Homes, a premium housebuilder, from John Laing for ¬£295 million. =Post-merger= In September 2008, Vinci bought the operations of Taylor Woodrow Construction and in April 2009, the remaining activities of Taylor Woodrow Construction in Ghana were sold to management.Investor Group acquires Taylor Woodrow of Ghana Ltd from Taylor Wimpey PLC through a leveraged buyout Reuters, 21 April 2009 Then in March 2011, a property investment group backed by private equity firms acquired Taylor Wimpey's American and Canadian housebuilding businesses.Taylor Wimpey sells American business for ¬£595m The Telegraph, 31 March 2011 = COVID-19 lockdown = On 23 March 2020, Taylor Wimpey \\"shut all its UK sites and sales centres ... following prime minister Boris Johnson's announcement of lockdown measures\\" in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Six weeks after shutting down, the firm claimed to be \\"the first major housebuilder to unveil a timetable for restarting jobs\\", and said it would begin remobilisation in England and Wales on 4 May 2020. Taylor Wimpey said that although all its show homes had been closed during the lockdown, sales had continued. \\"[T]otal orders grew by 200 during the shutdown to reach 10,880 homes, up from 10,291 in the order book a year ago.\\" Taylor Wimpey has also been busy running a manufacturing project with employees to supply \\"GP surgeries and care homes with reusable 3D printed face visors\\". In July 2020, Taylor Wimpey reported a ¬£40m loss in the first half of 2020 mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 lockdown. Revenue more than halved to ¬£754m. Completions fell 58% to 2,771 homes, compared to 6,541 during the first half of 2019. Operations Taylor Wimpey's United Kingdom operations are increasingly focused on the Taylor Wimpey brand with historic brands (Bryant Homes, George Wimpey, Laing Homes and G2) being phased out. Taylor Wimpey's corporate head office is located at Gate House in High Wycombe. There are 24 regional offices in the United Kingdom. Taylor Wimpey is headed up by Pete Redfern who has been CEO of the company since July 2007. The company completed a total of 6,541 homes in the first half of 2019, compared with 6,497 in 2018.

It features a clamping feedneck, four-point adjustable trigger, multiple firing modes, and an autococker-threaded barrel. Previous versions include the FS7 and a series of \\"Freestyle\\" models, each with a year designation. Operation The FS uses a spool system similar to an Automag, but instead of incorporating a shut-off valve, and using a sear/spring arrangement to return the bolt from its blow-forward operation, it uses air pressure. The system has full-pressure supply air stored in a dump chamber in the rear of the marker. This pressure is applied to the center pin in the rear of the bolt, which is biased to push it open. The regulated air supplied by a front Low Pressure Regulator (LPR) is run through a 2/3-way solenoid valve that is designed to be \\"Normally On\\" when it is not energized. This lower pressure air is supplied to the front of the bolt, and the regulator is adjusted to supply enough force to push the bolt back against the supply pressure. When the solenoid valve is energized the air in front of the bolt vents, allowing the bias supplied to the rear of the bolt to move it forward. When the bolt has moved forward enough to seal the breech, the pin unseals from the powertube it rides in, and air is vented through the bolt to the ball, firing it. When the solenoid valve is de-energized, air is again supplied to the front of the bolt to return it. Here is an animation of inside the 2004 generation one freestyle.

Founded in 1988, the club played their home games at Hull Arena. The club went through several name changes due to council influence before dissolving in 1999. Since that time, the club was followed first by Hull Thunder from 1999 until 2002, the Hull Stingrays from 2003 until 2015 and the Hull Pirates since 2015. History=Early years= The Humberside Seahawks were founded in 1988 under the ownership of Humberside County Council and the management of Adrian Florence. Beginning life in the old Heineken League Division 2, Canadian player-coach Dale Lambert quickly led the fledgling Seahawks to glory, winning the Division 2 title (and promotion to Division 1) in their inaugural season. Just two seasons later, in 1990/91, the Seahawks lost just three games in winning the Division 1 title, which they followed up by winning their play-off group and gaining promotion to the Heineken League Premier Division after just three years in the league. In their first season in the top flight the Seahawks quickly made their mark. Thrilling home wins against reigning champions, Durham Wasps, and runners up, Cardiff Devils, backed up bench coach Peter Johnson's bold claim that they would be battling in the top four, not against relegation. He was true to his word, leading the team to fourth place and the final of the Autumn Cup, a 5‚Äì7 defeat to the Nottingham Panthers, in the first final staged at the brand new 10,000 seat Sheffield Arena. Few doubt the season might have been more successful had it not been for long-term injuries to star imports Jim Lynch, Scott Morrison and Ross Lambert, who was also fined and suspended for threatening revenge on Wasp Stephen Cooper. ''' \\"Think Humberside Seahawks, think 1992/93, think Wembley!\\" ‚Äì Malcolm Richardson, Hull Daily Mail.''' ''' 1992/93 was to be Seahawks last. Fittingly it was also their most successful. Despite finishing 7th in the league ‚Äì a feat no doubt inspired by the pre-season turmoil that saw first Ross Lambert and then Peter Johnson assume the role of head coach ‚Äì Seahawks secured a 6‚Äì5 victory over the Wasps to win the Castle Eden Cup, a traditional two-day tournament held in February and featuring four teams based in the North East of England. More impressive, however, was the tenacity that saw the team overcome the Bees and Whitley Warriors in the play-offs to create history as the first seventh place team to reach the end of season finals weekend, then held at Wembley Arena. The semi-final against the Nottingham Panthers was a see-saw affair which saw the Seahawks leading 4‚Äì2 in the third period when a section of the surrounding Plexi-glass was broken, necessitating a 25-minute stoppage in play. Panthers returned from the dressing room to dominate the remainder of the third period and tie the score at 4‚Äì4. In overtime, Nottingham continued to dominate play, with star forward Paul Adey spurning a couple of good chances to win the match. With both sets of fans on the edge of their seats (and the overtime period causing the live snooker coverage to be delayed on BBC1) a Panthers turnover fell to Seahawks' Dan Dorion (and ex- Panther himself) who was cruising the blue line. Dorion skated towards the Panthers' zone with the puck and laid in a pinpoint pass to Kevin McNaught, who round the Panthers' goaltender and put away the sudden death winner and send the Seahawks into the final. A 7‚Äì4 defeat to the Cardiff Devils in the final the following day did little to dampen the Hull fans' spirits. Despite the knowledge that a sponsorship with British Aerospace was to see the team renamed the Hawks for the 1993‚Äì94 season, the Seahawks' place in the history books was assured. =New beginnings= In 1994 the Humberside Hawks were born but that was not the only change. Founder Dale Lambert was released as the club began what continues to be a deep fascination with the riches of Eastern Europe. Ukrainians Alexei Kuznetsov and Alexandr Koulikov joined returning heroes Frank Killen, Brian Cox, Mike Bishop and the Johnson brothers, to inspire what has since become the norm in Hull ‚Äì a season that began with such high hopes but quickly evaporated into one of spectacular failure. Ice hockey in Hull has never truly captured the imagination of the fans since the time of the Seahawks. Sell out crowds and the Seahawks' trumpeter have long since become memories as years of financial hardship have repeatedly taken their toll. 96‚Äì97 began with the end of the Johnson dynasty and ended with the death of the Hawk. John Griffith replaced the popular Peter Johnson, his sons, Stephen, Anthony and Shaun, quickly showing their anger by returning home to Tyneside and the newly renamed Newcastle Wasps. Uncertainty of a future was doubled when it was announced that Humberside County Council was to be abolished ‚Äì and the team's funding with it. Humberside was to be no more, but like the Seahawks before, uncertainty only served to inspire a glorious ending. Griffith's tenure was inconsistent although his sacking immediately before the play-offs came as a surprise as his side had never slipped below 5th place. His team was also easily the best since the Wembley class of 92‚Äì93, the Brit pack of John Wolfe, naughty Norman Pinnington and the re-classified Bishop and Graham Garden, combining well with veterans Andy Steel and Paul Simpson, and imports Phil Huber, Barclay Pearce, and ex-NHLers Derek Laxdal and Bruce Bell. His replacement, ex-Bees coach Keith Milhench, utilised these resources to full effect, overcoming the loss of Bell. This time the yellow brick roaded ended in a 3‚Äì6 semi-final defeat to Sheffield Steelers. Once again though the end ensured the Hawks would never be forgotten. =Name changes= Since the days of the Hawks, Ice Hockey in Hull has undergone major surgery with contrasting results. Keith Milhench's Kingston Hawks joined the newly formed Premier League and once again dared belief amongst the loyal as successive pre-season victories over the Superleague Manchester Storm suggested the likes of Chris Eimers, Oleg Synkov and Danuse Bauba might be able to emerge from the shadows of Hull greats and restore the city to the countries elite. Instead what has happened is repeated optimism and failure, the big name signings and returns of the likes of Dale Lambert, Mike Bishop and Ron Shudra failing to compensate the constant name changes and poor league positions that until recently had become near permanent. Following the Hawks came the Hull Thunder and most recently the Hull Stingrays. None have come close to rivalling the Seahawks in terms of size and success although Mike and Sue Pack at least restored security and a place in the Elite League. The Stingrays debuted at 9th place. On 11 August 2010, they closed the club due to financial problems, but six days later were taken over by the owners of Coventry Blaze, which secured their survival. However, on 24 June 2015, the Stingrays withdrew from the Elite League and folded due to financial problems. Afterwards, the Hull Pirates were founded as their replacement. Honours *English League **Champions (1): 1988‚Äì89 *British Championship **Runners-up (1): 1993 *Autumn Cup **Runners-up (1): 1991 Noted players Scott Morrison Morrison joined the Seahawks from Whitley Warriors in 1989, scoring 159 points in 39 games. Widely considered to be the finest player to grace the ice in Hull, Morrison scored another 220 points before an argument saw him transfer to the Billingham Bombers, and then back to the Warriors. In 95‚Äì96 the chain- smoking sniper returned as a Hawk, netting 89 goals and 187 points in 60 games. He left with Peter Johnson. enjoying a successful, nomadic career that took in the Basingstoke Bison and Ayr Scottish Eagles amongst others. Dale Lambert The big Canadian defender originally joined the Seahawks as player- coach from the Medway Bears, helping GM Adrian Florence mould the team into a successful franchise. Rugged and likeable, he quickly became to the Seahawks what Shannon Hope was to the Devils and Shudra to the Steelers ‚Äì vacating his coaching duties in 1993 only to concentrate on playing. But Wembley was to be his swansong, the love affair ending as a trade to the Solihull Barons was followed by spells in Milton Keynes, Durham, Newcastle, and Phoenix in the WCHL. He finally returned as coach of the Kingston Hawks in 1999‚Äì2000. A broken leg and less gifted players meant the good times were not to be repeated. Dan Dorion The skilful American forward first joined the Seahawks in 92‚Äì93, the former Panther and 91‚Äì92 player of the year quickly inspiring Humberside to a six-game winning streak that guaranteed seventh position and a play-off place. The New York native scored 86 points in just 27 games, with 9 goals and 12 assists in the Seahawks march to Wembley. Although he left for the ECHLs Roanoke Express in 1994 he again answered Peter Johnson's call and returned to replace the injured Hawk Kuznetsov, once again inspiring an immediate change in the club's fortunes. Despite 98 points in 34 games however, he could not bring about a return to the promised land. Shaun Johnson Youngest of the Johnson brothers, \\"Shuggy\\" was a crowd favourite ever since his arrival with the Johnson clan from Durham in 1990. Living in his brothers shadows he first emerged as a future star in 1991‚Äì92 ‚Äì receiving the first of many GB caps ‚Äì and 94‚Äì95 when he won the Player's Player of the Year Award at the age of 21. In 95‚Äì96, the winger joined his brothers in returning to the Wasps, where he quickly turned from a young star into experienced professional. After spells with Newcastle and Coventry he is now back home with the Vipers in the Elite League, rivals to the Stingrays. He is one of the most respected players in Britain and is the last remaining member of the Johnson dynasty. Stephen Johnson \\"Quacks\\" Johnson is the eldest and by far the most popular of the Johnson brothers in Hull. His number 10 shirt was retired in tribute to his time at the club, much of which was spent as captain. He was also the first brother to return after his family's infamous split with the Hawks ‚Äì returning from the Wasps in 1998‚Äì99 to play in the British National League with Kingston, Thunder and finally the Stingrays. At the time of his retirement he had scored more than 1000 points and 600+ goals in all games. his number 10 shirt is the only one so far retired by the Hull organisation. Anthony Johnson Middle brother and AC for the Seahawks, \\"Tant\\" gave his all in the no. 12 shirt, combining hard graft and commitment with the skill and vision that complemented his brothers so well. Like the others he remains one of the country's finest, he is up there with the likes of Tony Hand, Ian and Stephen Cooper et al. Despite his departure, like his brother he claimed he would never have left Hull were it not for the mistreatment of their father. He returned in the white and purple of the Thunder in 1999‚Äì2000, effectively ending his career in his spiritual home. =Squads= (1992‚Äì93) ‚Äì Scott Morrison (I)(F), Todd Bidner (I)(F), Ross Lambert (I)(F), Sylvain Naud (I)(F), Bobby Brown (I)(F), Ransom Drcar (I)(F), Stephen Johnson (F), Anthony Johnson (F), Shaun Johnson (F), Nigel Rhodes (F), Grant Slater (F), Andy Steel (F), Jim Lynch (I)(D), Dale Lambert (PC)(I)(D), Paul Dixon (D), Mark Pallister (D), Paul Simpson (D), Stewart Carvil (D), Bobby McEwen (D), Lee Barley (D),Lee.Wilson(D), Frankie Killen (NM), Andy Donald (NM), Ian Young (NM), David Selby (NM).

It was released by RKO Radio Pictures. The film was adapted by Andrew Solt from the novel Thanks, God! I'll Take It From Here by Jane Allen and Mae Livingston. The opening shot shows \\"Arrowhead\\" Pictures motion picture studio. This is the actual RKO Radio Pictures building at 780 Gower Street in Hollywood, retouched with \\"Arrowhead\\" replacing the RKO signs on the building. It remains a historic structure on the corner to this day. Plot Successful author Christopher \\"Kit\\" Madden (Claudette Colbert) travels to Los Angeles to work on the film adaptation of her best-selling book Here is Tomorrow. It is supposed to star Cary Grant as the Army Air Forces pilot hero Mark Winston and Lana Turner, but Grant has just dropped out and the producer thinks they need an unknown actor to play Winston. On a train to Hollywood, Kit meets two Marine pilots, Captain \\"Rusty\\" Thomas (John Wayne) and 1st Lieutenant \\"Dink\\" Watson (Don DeFore). She considers Rusty the best choice to play Mark Winston, but he is dismissive of her book: she wrote a political allegory and he does not believe Cary Grant would refuse Lana Turner for 400 pages. Unsure how he will react if he discovers she is a famous writer, she keeps her identity secret (saying her name is \\"Kitty Kloch\\"). After they are expelled from the train for drunkenness in a remote prairie town, the trio are given a ride in a rainstorm by a man who then trades them his car for Rusty's German war souvenir. The trio continue on and are welcomed at the farm of a large Hispanic family with an amorous daughter who showers attention on Rusty. They then flee there due to a misunderstanding. When Rusty finally learns Kit's true identity, he thinks that she has been using him just so he will appear in the motion picture. Nonetheless, after a number of missteps, the couple eventually reach Hollywood and are able to resolve their differences.

Described by journalist John Langdon-Davies in 1940: > As it fell from an aircraft, a small turbine on the nose turned to release a > spring loaded casing which, on opening, scattered 100 or more incendiary > bombs; the main HE charge in the tail of the weapon continued to fall as a > conventional bomb. Other descriptions make no mention of a main charge and instead describe a large cylinder with vanes at the back that open out when the weapon is dropped. The vanes cause the bomb to spin and this has the effect of opening the sides and scattering the submunitions by centrifugal force. In 1939, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, claimed the Soviet Union was not dropping bombs on Finland, but merely airlifting food to starving Finns. The Finns were not starving, and they dubbed the RRAB-3 cluster bomb \\"Molotov's bread basket.\\" They also named the improvised incendiary device that they used to counter Soviet tanks, commonly known as the Molotov cocktail, \\"a drink to go with the food.\\"The Second Book of General Ignorance, Faber and Faber, 2011, p. 76, This description seems to have become common currency among the British public in 1940. During the Bristol Blitz, the locals dubbed a similar German device \\"Goering's bread basket\\". The Soviets had several versions: RRAB-1, RRAB-2, RRAB-3, with capacities of 1000, 500, and 250 kg respectively, each capable of holding various types of submunitions including HE, incendiary, and chemical.

It is also known as What Every Woman Wants. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture (Daniele Amfitheatrof). Plot Banker Christopher Price from the humdrum town of Keetoosen, Ohio, is happily married to Mary, and the couple are just about to go to New York on their second honeymoon. However, Chris' old childhood friend Joe Parker, a known newspaper reporter who has been stationed abroad, sends him a message just before they begin their journey. Joe arrives in Keetoosen before the couple leaves, and explains that he has lied to his boss about being married to Mary, to get a longer vacation in the past. Now, he is to work in New York, and needs to \\"borrow\\" Mary to pretend that she is his wife, to save his career. Mary wants nothing to do with this, but Chris agrees to help out, lending Joe his wife. Joe and Mary go ahead to New York, but Chris is delayed because the trains are full. When they arrive to New York, Joe and Mary are taken to a press conference immediately, and their picture end up all over the papers. It turns out Joe's lies were a tad larger than he first said, since he has faked letters from his loving wife - letters that his boss, Arthur Truesdale Worth, has read. Chris experiences some large bumps on his way to New York, as his boss Arnold sees the pictures of Joe and Mary in the papers, and believes Chris is an adulterer. Arnold forces Chris to stay on in Keetoosen a few days longer to fend off a scandal. Another person from Keetoosen recognizes Mary clubbing with Joe in New York. When Chris eventually makes it to New York the evening after, Worth and other people get suspicious of his interest in \\"Mrs. Parker\\". Eventually Mary pretends to be in love with Joe, and even tells her friend Suzy about this. On invitation from Worth, she comes out to Long Island to his house, with Joe as company. Chris finds out where they are and sneaks into the house. He finds Joe and Mary under a romantic night sky on a balcony, and believes Mary has fallen for the reporter. The truth is that Mary pretends to be suicidal, threatening to jump off the balcony because Joe doesn't return her feelings for him. Chris knocks out Joe and takes Mary away in his car. Joe takes the opportunity to play the devastated husband who has been left by his wife, and gets sympathy from Worth. Mary is quite happy with Chris' actions and that he finally stood up to his friend.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/77047/Guest-Wife/ CastReferencesExternal links  Category:1945 films Category:1945 comedy films Category:American films Category:American comedy films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Sam Wood Category:United Artists films Category:Films scored by Daniele Amfitheatrof ","title":"Guest Wife"},{"id":"10387100","text":"Mah Damba (born Mah Sissoko in Bamako, Mali, 1965) is a traditional griot singer.

The Saudi government closely monitors media and restricts it under official state law. Changes have been made to lessen these restrictions; however, some government-led efforts to control information have also drawn international attention. In 2014, Reporters Without Borders described the government as, \\"relentless in its censorship of the Saudi media and the Internet,\\" and in 2018, it ranked Saudi Arabia 169th out of 180 countries for freedom of the press. Law and operation Though formal laws regarding censorship were not yet in place for Saudi Arabia, hostile conditions in the country led leaders to take on stricter rules that in turn affected the media. Specifically, the Iranian Islamic revolution and seizure of the Grand Mosque by extremists in 1979 led the government to crack down on women and radical Sunnis. The government under King Khalid, and later his brother King Fahd, enforced policies to help counteract potential hostility and unrest, such as working closely with the religious establishment to create reforms. Government regulation of media was not formally detailed until 1992, when a new wave of discontent emerged. The government released a 1992 media policy statement, which outlined aims for journalists including both a religious and political component in favor of Islam and Saudi Arabia respectively. The government either had direct control over, or indirectly exerted power over, media sources in order to prevent any criticism of the royal family, the government, or Islamic values. Saudi Arabia is distinct from other Gulf Cooperation Council countries in that its constitution does not protect freedom of expression. The Basic Law of Governance, enacted as an informal constitution in 1992, formally specified limits to free expression. Article 39 of the kingdom's Basic Law of Governance states that: > [The media] is prohibited from committing acts leading to disorder and > division, affecting the security of the state and its public relations, or > undermining human dignity and rights. The Law of Printing and Publication, enacted in 2003, expanded upon the regulation of media, encompassing books, drawings, writings, photographs, films, recordings, radio and television broadcasts. The law, which is enforced by the Ministry of Culture and Information, requires government licensing for any of the aforementioned activities. It lays out a series of restrictions, including that the printed matter will not conflict with Sharia law, will not threaten public security, and will not \\"stir up discord among citizens.\\" Though this law was written in the context of print media, it also extends to electronic media. In 2007, the Saudi government issued an Anti-Cyber Crimes Law, which lists cyber crimes that can result in imprisonment and fines. The law specifically prohibits content that negatively impacts public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, \\"through the information network or computers,\\" which can include content that promotes drug use, pornography, gambling, or terrorism. A 2011 royal decree extended the licensing requirement to include online newspapers and blogs and increased penalties for violations of the earlier press law. Those penalties include large fines, removal of the content, and potentially closure of the establishment responsible, along with suspending or banning the person or group from future publishing. In charging individuals with violations, the government often applies these laws, sometimes in conjunction with counterterrorism laws. These laws extend the definition of terrorism to include content that is damaging to Saudi Arabia, its reputation, stability, and security. The Ministry of Information is responsible for overseeing Saudi media and has been called the \\"main agent of censorship\\" in the kingdom. A special unit, the Management of Publications department, analyzes publications and issues \\"directives\\" to newspapers and magazines that state the way in which a given topic must be treated. According to the Encyclopedia of Censorship, \\"The main effect of this system has been to impose on journalists rigorous self-censorship.\\"  Press  The print media in Saudi Arabia, though privately-owned, is closely tied to the government. The registration of new journalists, changes in staff of a media outlet, and creation of new outlets all require government approval. Due to government subsidies, the daily newspapers often rely on state support and tend to align with the Saudi Press Agency on more controversial topics. Despite this, newspapers have increasingly published stories on topics such as crime, drug trafficking, and extremism. Some censorship of foreign newspapers and magazines targets content of sexual nature, including nudity, pornography, and homosexuality. In 1994, all Saudi women magazines were banned by the Ministry of Information. This move was considered to be related to the pressures of the religious establishment or ulema. After this ban, nineteen of twenty-four magazines closed down due to the fact that their major revenue had been advertisement earnings paid by Saudi companies. There are numerous documented instances of the Saudi government forcing the resignation of journalists or banning them from publishing in the country. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported in 2002 that the Ministry of Information forced two different newspaper editors to resign and fired the head of a publishing house due to the critical and liberal nature of what they had published. Several more writers were banned from the press in 2003, including Wajeha Al-Huwaider, a writer for Al-Watan and Arab News and a prominent women's rights activist. Though the Ministry of Information is responsible for monitoring the press, the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia also alerts of the government of journalists. In some cases, religious clerics called for punishments including death to be given to critics of Wahhabi Islam in the media. These punishments were sometimes issued in religious court, such as in 2003 when the journalist Mansour al-Nogaidan claimed he was sentenced to 75 lashes for his articles criticizing the religious doctrine of the country. = Jamal Khashoggi = The case of journalist Jamal Khashoggi gained international attention. After many years serving as a reporter and foreign correspondent for several Arab newspapers, Khashoggi worked as a deputy editor-in-chief of Arab News from 1999 to 2003. In 2003, he became the editor-in-chief for Al Watan, a daily newspaper that pushed for reform in Saudi Arabia and published information of more sensitive issues, specifically regarding the Riyadh compound bombings. Khashoggi was dismissed from his position at Al Watan because under his leadership columnists wrote articles questioning the religious police and criticizing the country's following of Ibn Taymiyyah, the Islamic scholar who inspired Wahhabism. He left Saudi, and began working in the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., but later returned to Al Watan until he was once again removed three years later. After leaving Al Watan, Khashoggi appeared as a commentator on different Arab and international news channels and wrote for a variety of publications. Khashoggi was a columnist for Al-Hayat newspaper but was banned in December 2016 after he wrote articles criticizing Donald Trump. He left the Kingdom, going into a \\"self-imposed exile\\" in the United States in 2017 due to fear of arrest, and began writing for The Washington Post. On 2 October 2018, Khashoggi went missing after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. He had to collect some documents from the Consulate Saudi officials claimed that they were not responsible for Khashoggi's death but were not able to provide evidence of what happened. Meanwhile Turkish officials stated that Saudi agents killed and dismembered him, before dumping him in a Turkish forest. Saudi officials later reported that Khashoggi died in a fight with people he met in the consulate. After several weeks of contradictory claims from the Saudi government, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency concluded that Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman ordered the assassination of Khashoggi, although the matter of who directed the assassination is still in question by some parties. This case was highly publicized due to the notability of Khashoggi as a reporter with ties to the royal family who faced numerous restrictions in his career as a journalist. In May 2019, Amnesty International claimed that Saudi Arabia used NSO Group‚Äôs Pegasus software to target activists and journalists, including Khashoggi. Deputy Director of Amnesty Tech claimed that ‚Äúgovernments who are known for outrageous human rights abuses‚Äù use this software to track down the dissidents and human rights defenders. The Kingdom Came to Canada, a Citizen Lab‚Äôs report, shows how Omar Abdulaziz, another Saudi activist residing in Canada, was targeted by the Saudi government to access the sensitive conversations he had with his friend Jamal Khashoggi. Abdulaziz had also filed a law suit in December 2018, alleging that the Saudi authorities used Pegasus spyware to hack his phone and access his conversations. Film and television Public cinemas became illegal in 1983 when conservative clerics deemed cinemas a corrupting influence, claiming that both Western and Arab-language films were, \\"contrary to the teachings of Islam.\\" Over time, the ban on movie theaters was counteracted by the introduction of satellite television and video downloads, as well as by Saudis regularly visiting nearby Dubai and Bahrain where they could go to public cinemas freely. As citizens tried to circumvent some of these restrictions, the Saudi government lessened their regulations, but maintained some level of censorship. The government initially banned ownership of satellite television receivers in 1994. However, after an increasingly large percentage of the population bought satellite receivers and subscribed to various programming packages, the Saudi government grew more willing to tolerate satellite television as long as the programming content was not pornographic, critical of the Saudi government or Islam. Instances of censorship continued mainly due to the content of broadcasts. In 2005, two episodes of American Dad!, Stan of Arabia: Part 1 and Part 2, were banned by the Saudi government.Will ‚ÄòAmerican Dad‚Äô Define the Saudis for Us? Michael Saba, ArabNews, 15 December 2005 The English daily ArabNews published an article that accused the series, which had scenes regarding the intolerance of homosexuality and the ban of alcohol, of portraying Saudi Arabia in a negative light. In 2008, disgruntled callers on a live show on Al-Ikhbariya news channel displayed discontent with the latest governmental salary increases and made critical remarks of some Saudi officials. Information Minister, Iyad Madani, then fired the network's director, Muhammad Al-Tunsi, and replaced him with one of his personal assistants. The minister also announced a temporary suspension of live broadcasts for all Saudi public TV channels. In recent years, the country has moved towards lifting the restrictions on this form of media. In 2007, permission was granted to two hotels to screen American children's films, to celebrate the end of Ramadan. The following year, the first Saudi film festival took place. In December 2017, the Saudi government announced its decision to end the three decade ban on public cinemas, as part of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's campaign to introduce nationwide changes to help broaden and strengthen the economy. By early 2018, the Ministry of Information began licensing the opening of movie houses, but noted that all movies were subject to existing media laws, stating that films would be \\"subjected to censorship based on the media policy of the kingdom.‚Äù For instance, a 40-second scene involving two characters kissing was removed from the first movie screened in public theaters, Black Panther.  The Internet  An Arabic wikipedia article regarding evolution blocked in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia directs all international Internet traffic through a proxy farm located in King Abdulaziz City for Science & Technology. A content filter is implemented there, based on software by Secure Computing. Since October 2006, the Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) has been handling the DNS structure and filtering in Saudi Arabia in the place of KACST. Additionally, a number of sites are blocked according to two lists maintained by the Internet Services Unit (ISU): one containing \\"immoral\\" (mostly pornographic or supportive of LGBT-rights) sites and sites promoting Shia Ideology, the others based on directions from a security committee run by the Ministry of Information (including sites critical of the Saudi government). An interesting feature of this system is that citizens are encouraged to actively report \\"immoral\\", mostly adult and pornographic, sites for blocking using a provided web form, available on the government's website. The initial legal basis for content filtering is the resolution by Council of Ministers dated 12 February 2001.Saudi internet rules, 2001 , Arab Media According to a study carried out in 2004 by the Open Net Initiative \\"the most aggressive censorship focused on pornography, drug use, gambling, religious conversion of Muslims, and filtering circumvention tools.\\" Additionally, Saudi Arabia blocks websites affiliated with Iran, with Hezbollah, with groups in Yemen, websites associated with the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria, and information related to the Holocaust. Saudi Arabia, like other countries, utilizes technology often from Western companies, such as American-owned SmartFilter, in order to automatically filter websites based on certain topic material. The government also monitors for unusual spikes in internet traffic related to content it wants to censor. An example of this filtering was seen after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, when the number of websites being censored in Saudi Arabia reportedly doubled, particularly websites of foreign news services such as Fox News and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. This is according to Censored Planet, an online initiative that aims to track online censorship through multiple methods, including scanning internet protocol (IP) addresses associated with particular websites. = Censorship on Various Platforms = In 2011, the Saudi government introduced new Internet rules and regulations that require all online newspapers and bloggers to obtain a special license from the Ministry of Information.Saudi Arabia bans blogging without a licence by Emma Woollacott, 6 January 2011 Liberal activists are monitored both on blogs and on social media. In a highly public 2012 case, a blogger, Raif Badawi, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes and given a 10 year ban on media work or foreign travel. Example of Saudi Arabian ISP blocking a website On 11 July 2006 the Saudi government blocked access to wikipedia and Google Translate, which was being used to bypass the filters on the blocked sites by translating them. Hassna‚Äôa Mokhtar, Arab News 19 July 2006 () SIA News Riyadh, 14 July 2006 () Though wikipedia is not blocked currently, specific pages on wikipedia were reported to be censored by Saudi Arabia in 2011, such as one page discussing the theory of evolution. Encrypted connections denoted by \\"HTTPS\\" made censorship more difficult for these pages and today there is no evidence that individual pages are still being blocked. YouTube is not blocked in the country. However, in 2014, Saudi Arabia made plans to regulate local companies producing content for YouTube. The General Authority for Audiovisual Media, a recently formed watchdog, issued a public declaration to regulate the work of YouTube channels. They planned to censor material that is \\"terrorist\\" in nature which according to the proposed rule will be any content that \\"disturbs public order, shakes the security of society, or subjects its national unity to danger, or obstructs the primary system of rule or harms the reputation of the state\\".https://news.yahoo.com/saudi-watchdog-regulate- homegrown-youtube-shows-newspaper-151254772-- sector.html;_ylt=A0LEVj.lVVxT4i8AiHxjmolQ;_ylu=X3oDMTBsa3ZzMnBvBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlkAw-- The Saudi government began blocking internet communications through online apps such as Skype and WhatsApp in 2013, due to fears that activists may use these platforms. As part of the country's economic reforms to boost businesses and diversify the economy, the government lifted the ban in 2017. However, the CITC confirmed that calls will still be monitored and censored, both on global and local apps. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are widely used in Saudi Arabia, with nearly 30 percent of Arab region Twitter users from Saudi. Twitter has become an important platform for expressing dissent. However, liberal citizens, and more recently conservatives, have been arrested and sometimes given punishments, such as prison time and fines, for criticizing the government on social media. The government has been reported to have a hand in utilizing bots and human \\"trolls\\" in order to minimize the work of its critics on Twitter. Saudi was also accused of infiltrating Twitter through a Saudi employee that joined the company in 2013 but was put on leave two years later after the potential plot was brought to the attention of Twitter. On 13 July 2020, the public records updated that the UK government was selling wiretaps, spyware and other equipment to 17 repressive regimes, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and China.

Twice a Guggenheim Fellow (1981 and 1987), Gordon has been a panelist of the dance program panels of the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts, and chairman of the former. He is a member of the Actors Studio, and a founder of the Center for Creative Research. Gordon is married to Valda Setterfield, a dancer and actress born in England, who was for 10 years a featured soloist with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company.

They also participated in the \\"First New York Theater Rally\\" organized by Waring at the 81st Street Theater, a seminal cross-fertilization event which mixed a new generation of dancer/choreographers such as Gordon, Carolyn Brown, Trisha Brown, Lucinda Childs, Deborah Hay, Steve Paxton and Yvonne RainerGordon was in the first group to perform Rainer's seminal piece Trio A, along with Rainer and Paxton. Rainer says that Gordon was doubtful at first about his ability to execute it in the proper style. > Now I say anyone can master the style, or just about anyone.

Banes (2003), p.50 *Helen's Dance (1962), *Random Breakfast (1963) - in which Setterfield did a striptease, and Gordon impersonated Milton Berle impersonating Carmen Miranda;Sally Banes writes about Random Breakfast that it > parodied the 'Judson Church Dance Factory Gold Rush in which choreography > ran rampant' ...

Banes (2003), pp. 13-14 and *Silver Pieces (Fragments) (1964).Silver Pieces (Fragments) was performed under two different names, \\"Fragments\\" in Philadelphia and \\"Silver Pieces\\" at the Judson Church. The evening-long piece was created from odds and ends of unfinished and abandoned solos and duets for Gordon and Setterfield, tied together with the visual device of a television set, but with no other thematic connection between the constituent parts. In 1981, Gordon wrote that for the New York performance: > I used my home television set sprayed silver. Valda and I wore tights and > leotards sprayed silver and plastic child wigs (like swimming caps) sprayed > silver ...

Gordon and Setterfield were described during this period as \\"amiable saboteurs ... [with] the stylistic skill of old music-hall comedians ... [and] a wickedly perceptive wit.\\"McDonagh (1971), pp.279-281 In 1966, vociferously negative audience response to his solo piece Walks and Digressions - Gordon wrote that \\"[t]he audience booed, hissed, clapped, stamped their feet, and walked out across the performance space while I was working\\"Gordon, David (March 1975) \\"It's About Time\\" The Drama Review v.19 n.1 - caused him to stop making dances for five years. > The review was devastating, and I wasn't clever enough to understand or use > the possible notoriety attached to that performance (after all, obviously no > one was bored) in a positive career move.

Gordon, David (January 1983) Remarks made during the \\"Collaboration: Investigating New Forms\\" session at the Theatre Communications Group National Conference in June 1982. Published in \\"TCG Focus: Combining Forces\\" in Theatre Communications Gordon credits these early experiences with laying the groundwork for his artistic process: > Jimmy [Waring] was an education for me, as he was for most people who came > in contact with him. ... [He] taught me about art and developed my taste, > but I didn't begin to understand about making work until later with Yvonne > Rainer. From her I found out what it is to be an artist - a person who makes > choices and stands behind them. Then, from working with Trisha Brown in the > Grand Union, I learned how to edit, how to boil a thing down to its essence. > Jimmy's approach was much more whimsical. His way of working led you - or > led me at any rate - to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought > of it. I thought of it and I kept it, and what came next was what I thought > of next. I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility for > my work, but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing was all I had > to do to make art. I never threw anything away. I remember distinctly > Jimmy's saying, \\"If you don't like it now, you can get to like it. If you > can't get to like it, who says you have to like it?\\" The point of it was to > demystify art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste. > There was a great sense of liberation that stemmed from John Cage's > championing of this philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing > alternatives to the kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance > composition up until then. In 1971 Gordon returned to making dances when Rainer put him in charge of her classes while she went to India, from which came the material which became Sleepwalking, first performed at Oberlin College and then in New York. Gordon formed the Pick Up Performance Company that year - incorporated in 1978 as a non-profit organization - to support and administer his work in live performance and media. His work during this periodsee \\"About David Gordon: Resume\\" on choreographer Margaret Jenkins's website for a list of productions included: *The Matter (1972) - which utilized volunteer non-dancers who had signed up at a Grand Union concert to participate in Gordon's next project.Smith, Karen (September 1972) \\"David Gordon's The Matter\\" The Drama Review v.16 n.3 The piece was re-mounted in 1979, with additions and subtractions, as The Matter (Plus and Minus), and was later the inspiration for The Matter/2012: Art and Archive, performed at Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery, as well as The Matter at MoMA / 2018, performed at the Museum of Modern Art as part of the retrospective exhibition Judson Dance Theater: The Work is Never Done.Macaulay, Alastair (October 19, 2018) \\"At MoMA, Judson Dance Looks Back With Anger and Toughness\\" The New York Times *Times Four (1975), *Personal Inventory (1976) - in which Gordon and Setterfield each had to improvise 500 different movements, counting them as they went, *Wordsworth and the Motor (1977), *Not Necessarily Recognizable Objectives (1977) - for which Gordon won the first SoHo Weekly News Soho Arts Award in Avant-Garde Dance, *What Happened (1978), *An Audience With the Pope (or This Is Where I Came In) (1979) and the seminal Chair (1974), a duet for Gordon and Setterfield in which they perform with metal folding chairs, the use of which became a signature of his work.Copeland, Roger (Autumn/Winter 1996) \\"The Double Identity of David Gordon\\" Dance Theatre Journal v. 13 n.2 Critic Deborah Jowitt wrote of his works during this period that \\"process and polish were linked in pretty paradoxes.\\"Jowitt, Deborah (1988) Time and the Dancing Image. Berkeley, California, University of California Press. . p.336 By this time Gordon and Setterfield had a developed a reputation as \\"the dance world's most intriguing couple. Ideal mates, ideal opposites, yin and yang, male and female, total communication.\\" Also during this period and into the 1980s, Gordon, a natural contrarian, did not call himself a \\"choreographer\\", but billed his pieces as being \\"constructed\\" by him. Although he has collaborated with visual artists and designers such as Power Boothe, Red Grooms and Santo Loquasto, Gordon has often, usually without being credited for it, designed the costumes, decor and props for his pieces. In doing so, he frequently utilizes the contents of thrift stores and makes use of mundane materials such as cardboard, foam core, and gaffers tape, as well as commercially produced items such as clothing racks and rolling ladders. Gordon's hand-made score for One Part of The Matter - an excerpt from The Matter for solo dancer (Setterfield) - which consisted of cut-outs of poses culled from photographs by Eadweard Muybridge taped to sheets of paper, is in the drawings collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.Museum of Modern Art, Department of Drawings (c. 1971‚Äì1972) \\"Painters for the Theater, Drawings Gallery, July 14-October 18, 1989, Checklist\\" Four pages of Gordon's score were part of this exhibition, ascension numbers 127.84.a-d \\"Untitled study for the performance THE MATTER, performed by the Merce Cunningham Company, Oberlin College, Ohio and New York, 1972\\" The score came about because Setterfield was on tour with the Cunningham company, and Gordon sent her the poses so she could memorize them in her hotel room. When she returned, they worked together on the transitions between the poses. Since then, Setterfield has performed One Part of the Matter in many venues around the world. 1980s In 1980, Gordon gave up his job creating window displays,Gordon learned the craft of display work at S. Klein On The Square, Saks Fifth Avenue and Best & Co., and for many years did the windows of the Japanese-based Azuma chain of retail stores in New York. which for 18 years had supported both his work and his family - his son Ain was born in 1962 - to work full-time as a performer and choreographer.Gordon also did other work in the visual arts. His life-sizes collages made from torn colored no-seam paper were used as backgrounds for photographs of scientists in a Life magazine spread, which was later published in Modell, Walter; Lansing, Alfred and the editors of Life (1967) \\"When Natural Defenses Fail\\" in Life Science Library: Drugs. New York: Time-Life Books, pp.102-119 except p.117. He also appeared in two seminal documentaries about postmodern dance, Beyond the Mainstream: The Postmoderns, part of the PBS Dance in America series, and Michael Blackwood's Making Dances, which focused on seven choreographers: Brown, Lucinda Childs, Gordon, Douglas Dunn, Kenneth King, Meredith Monk and Sara Rudner.Croce, Arlene (June 30, 1980) \\"Dancing: Slowly Then the History of Them Comes Out\\". The New Yorker\\"Making Dances\\" on the Michael Blackwood Productions website In the 1980s, his Pick-Up Company toured throughout the United States, performing both intimate pieces such as: *Close Up (1979) - a duet for Gordon and Setterfield - and *Dorothy and Eileen (1980), in which two female dancers improvise dialogue about their mothers - which has been called \\"[o]ne of his most successfully conceived and rendered pieces\\"; as well as larger-scale works, including: *T.V. Reel (1982), *Trying Times (1982) - which ends with Gordon being put on trial by his dancers; this piece and Framework which followed it feature \\"visual devices\\" - such as open wooden frames, canvas cloths painted with diagonal stripes, and painted Masonite boards, as well as a double-hinged construction of wood-framed heavy cardboard panels which was manipulated by the dancers into numerous different patterns which they then interacted with - by artist Power Boothe, some of which will also later be used in Dancing Henry V. *Framework (1983), *My Folks (1984) - set to klezmer music, *Four Men Nine Lives (1985), *Transparent Means for Travelling Light (1986) - performed to a score by John Cage, and the mammoth United States (1988‚Äì1989), which was co-commissioned by 26 presenters in 16 statesStamler, Gayle (October 1988) \\"'United States' comes together\\" in ACUCAA Bulletin and has so many sections which exist in different but related versions that they have never all been performed together. Many of Gordon's pieces from this period had their premiere at David White's Dance Theater Workshop. Gordon also made work for other companies during this time, including: *Grote Ogen (\\"Big Eyes\\") for Wekcentrum Dans in the Netherlands (1981), *Pas et Par for Theatre du Silence in Lyons (1981), *Counter Revolution (1981), Field Study (1984) and Bach and Offenbach (1986) for London's Extemporary Dance Theatre, *Piano Movers to music by Thelonious Monk for Dance Theatre of Harlem (1984),Croce, Arlene (July 8, 1985) \\"Dancing: Opus Posthumous\\". The New Yorker *Beethoven and Boothe (1985) for Group Recherche Choreographique de l'Opera de Paris, and *Mates for Rambert Dance Company (1988). He also made Field, Chair and Mountain (1985) and Murder (1986) for American Ballet Theatre (ABT) under Mikhail Barishnikov. Murder later became part of David Gordon's Made in U.S.A., a television program commissioned by WNET and Great Performances in 1987 as part of the Dance in America series. Gordon received a Primetime Emmy Award for the program. For the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) in 1983, Gordon choreographed Act III, the dance section, of The Photographer, a multi-media piece about Eadweard Muybridge with music by Philip Glass, in which he incorporated Setterfield's earlier solo One Part of the Matter. Also, he directed Renard, a one-act chamber opera-ballet by Igor Stravinsky, for the Spoleto Festival USA in 1986. 1990s The Mysteries and What's So Funny? (1991), in which Marcel Duchamp - played by Setterfield - is the central figure around which all the action swirls, received a Bessie and an Obie Award. It was written, directed and choreographed by Gordon with music again by Philip Glass and visual design by Red Grooms. The script was published in Grove New American Theater.Feingold, Michael (ed.) (1994) Grove New American Theater New York: Grove Press. Gordon then collaborated with his son, playwright Ain Gordon, on The Family Business, which premiered at Dance Theater Workshop in New York City in February 1994, received an Obie Award, and was presented at New York Theatre Workshop and at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in 1995. The cast for The Family Business consisted of both Gordons, father and son, and Setterfield. In 1994, for the American Repertory Theatre (ART) in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the American Music Theatre Festival (AMTF) in Philadelphia, Gordon directed and choreographed an original musical, Shlemiel the First, adapted by Robert Brustein, from the stories of Isaac Bashevis Singer, and set to traditional klezmer music with new lyrics by Arnold Weinstein.According to Alvin Klein, writing in The New York Times: > \\"Shlemiel\\" is choreographed and directed by Mr. Gordon who, it appears, > regards its eight musicians (the Klezmer Conservatory Band) as cast members > in an interweaving of music and moving stage pictures, of words, spoken and > sung. It can be said that Singer is the original author, Mr. Brustein is the > adapter and Mr. Gordon is the auteur. Klein, Alvin (April 9, 1995) \\"Theater: 'Shlemiel' Continues A Path to Broadway\\" The New York Times Subsequent productions have been seen at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles - for which Gordon won Drama-Logue Awards for his direction and choreography in 1997 - and the American Conservatory Theater (ACT) in San Francisco. The show also toured throughout Florida and in Stamford, Connecticut, and was re-mounted in 2010 at Montclair State University's Alexander Kasser Theatre by Peak Performances. This production was re-mounted by Theatre for a New Audience in Manhattan, New York City in late 2011, at New York University's Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, in association with the National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene.Cox, Gordon (August 10, 2011) \\"TFANA sets 2011-12 season\\". Variety Gordon received a National Theatre Artist Residency Grant, funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts and administered by Theatre Communications Group, to work with the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, where he directed and choreographed The Firebugs by Max Frisch for their mainstage in 1995. Ain and David Gordon collaborated again on the book and direction for Punch & Judy Get Divorced, with music by Edward Barnes and lyrics by Arnold Weinstein, which premiered at AMTF in 1996 and was subsequently presented by ART. The piece began in 1991 as a one-act television program made for KTCA for their PBS series Alive TV, and had a second life as a dance piece, set to music by Carl Stalling, for Barishnikov's White Oak Dance Project in 1992. In 1999, the Gordons worked together once more, this time on a musical about women directors in the early days of motion pictures, The First Picture Show, with music by Jeanine Tesori, for ACT in San Francisco and the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. 2000s - 2020s Other productions Gordon has created as writer, director and choreographer include Autobiography of a Liar (1999), FAMILY$DEATH@ART.COMedy (2001) - for which he received his third Bessie Award - and Private Lives of Dancers (2002), all originally presented at Danspace in New York. In 2000, he was commissioned by ACT to write an adaptation of Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows, with music by Gina Leishman, called Some Kind of Wind in the Willows. This production was workshopped but was never produced. \\"Some Kind of Wind in the Willows\\" on GinaLeishman.com In that same year, he assembled and directed for Baryshnikov's White Oak Project a retrospective program of postmodern dance, PAST/Forward, which included pieces by Gordon, Simone Forti, Steve Paxton, Deborah Hay, Yvonne Rainer, Lucinda Childs and Trisha Brown.Houston, Lynn (September 2001) \\"Bodies of History and Historical Bodies: Baryshnikov and the Judson Legacy: White Oak at Gammage Auditorium, Tempe, Arizona, October 15, 2000\\" in PAJ: A Journal of Performance and Art (Volume 23, Number 3), pp. 13-19, abstractIn his statement for the program of PAST/Forward, Gordon thanks Baryshnikov, \\"who keeps giving me jobs I don't know how to do.\\" Banes (2003), pp.202-03 In 2004, Gordon made Dancing Henry Five, which utilized William Walton's music for Laurence Olivier's film of Shakespeare's Henry V, as well as dialogue from the film and recorded dramatic recitations of the text by Christopher Plummer and others. This production received an American Masterpiece Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts Dance Program,\\"FY 2010 Grant Awards: American Masterpieces: Dance\\" on the National Endowment for the Arts website and has been seen in New York; the Walker Arts Center in Minneapolis; the University of Kansas; the University of Maryland; Lexington, Kentucky; and ODC/Dance in San Francisco. In 2011 it was revived and performed at Montclair State University in New Jersey, Columbia College in Chicago and the University of Albany, New York. Gordon has also adapted, directed and choreographed a number of classic theatre works: *Eug√®ne Ionesco's The Chairs (2004, presented in London, Seattle and at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City) - in which he and Setterfield played the Old Man and the Old Woman to a solo cello score composed by Michael Gordon (no relation) and performed by Wendy Sutter both live and pre-recorded;Demetre, Jim (November 12, 2004) \\"A fresh arrangement of 'The Chairs'\\" Seattle Post- IntelligencerMcCarter, Jeremy (December 3, 2004) \\"Made in Japan (& America, & Japan...)\\" New York Sun *He Who Gets Slapped (2004, for Theatre for a New Audience in New York); *Aristophanes' The Birds (2006, as Aristophanes in Birdonia); *The Roundheads and the Pointheads by Bertholt Brecht with music by Hanns Eisler (2002-2009, as Uncivil Wars: Moving with Brecht and Eisler), commissioned by the Walker Arts Center in Minneapolis and The Kitchen in New York City, and also performed at Montclair State University. The piece was workshopped at Cornell University, and was later re-explored in Philadelphia in 2014 under the title Political Shenanigans. *Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, plus two other short pieces by the writer, became the basis of Gordon's Beginning of the End of the..., which played for the month of June 2012 at the Joyce SoHo, in Manhattan.La Rocco, Claudia (June 7, 2012) \\"Art, Life and Death, Inexplicably Intertwined\\", The New York Times In October 2012, Gordon mounted for Danspace Project The Matter/2012: Art and Archive, based on his early work The Matter (1972/1979), and including versions of Mannequin (1962) and Chair (1974). The piece was part of the series Platform 2012: Judson Now, connected to the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the first Judson Dance Theater performances,\\"The Matter/2012\\" on the Danspace Project website and was called by The New York Times \\"a breathtaking evening of dance that pays homage to his early days.\\"Kourlas, Gia (October 27, 2012) \\"The Old Is New Again, as the Muse Endures\\" The New York Times In April 2013, Gordon was named as one of twenty artists who received a Doris Duke Artist Award from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, an unrestricted multi-year award of $225,000 plus additional amounts for audience development and \\"personal reserves or creative exploration during what are commonly retirement years for most Americans\\".

The piece was extensively workshopped and performed in San Francisco, at the American Conservatory Theater, and in Los Angeles at the Mark Taper Forum, which had commissioned the piece. After the success of Shlemiel the First in L.A. several years before, expectations were high for the new musical, but the critical reception was not overly positive - the critic for the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"This tantalizing if unformed project has too vital a subject, or subjects, for mere nostalgia. Occasionally wonderful and never dull, 'The First Picture Show' lacks a certain urgency in its storytelling.\\"Phillips, Michael (August 13, 1999) \\"When Silent Was Golden\\" Los Angeles Times - and the production had no commercial transfer after its subscription run. Some years later, in response to a question about whether his career had ever \\"hit the wall\\", Gordon said: \\"I died in L.A.\\", but acknowledges that he then \\"came back to New York and began again, choreographing for my own company.\\"Kourlas, Gia (July 24‚Äì30, 2008) \\"'I'm always thinking I've failed'\\" Time Out New York One of the results of starting over was Dancing Henry Five. Analysis and interpretation Throughout his career, critics have encapsulated Gordon and his work: * > Gordon wants to sensitize the spectator to a shifting dialectic between the > individual gesture and the larger choreographic structure in which it is > embedded. Rather than highlighting the individual gesture as such, Gordon > playfully investigates the ways in which a discreet movement in a dance > phrase will change in terms of how we perceive it as a result of the > position it occupies in systematically varied choreographic complexes. (No√´l > Carroll, 1978) Carroll, No√´l (October 12, 1978) \\"Formal Dancing\\" SoHo Weekly > News * > [Gordon] has been labelled a formalist, a structuralist, a master wordsmith, > an avant-garde comedian, a satirist, a reflexive parodist. His works are > profound investigations of correspondances and collisions between language > and movement, examinations of the creative and performing processes, > explorations of structures. They are also enormously likable and often > delightfully humorous. (Amanda Smith, 1981) Smith, Amanda (February 1981) > \\"David Gordon: Keeping the Options Open\\" Dancemagazine * > In David Gordon's dances, simple movement phrases are reiterated until what > you notice is not the movement itself but the distinctiveness of the bodies > of the performers. Gordon's genius lies both in his choice of dancers, most > noticeably his wife and longtime collaborator Valda Setterfield, and in his > gestural vocabulary. Also, his use of language underscores the message of > his dances, which is that the body's actions and signals, like words, can > change their meaning depending on their context. The phrasing of Gordon's > movements is uninflected, fluid, tending to slide comfortably through the > memory, so that what you want to pay attention to is the very manner in > which these particular interesting figures do whatever it is they are doing. > (Sally Banes, 1981) Banes, Sally (1981) \\"Icon and Image in New Dance\\" in New > Dance USA (festival catalogue) Minneapolis: Walker Arts Center * > >> [L]ongtime observers of Gordon's work would be hard pressed to find a better definition of it than one vast game that he plays with Valda Setterfield. His sense of irony has been bouncing off her level, unassuming fa√ßade for years. Since she is always perfectly straight, Gordon's own gift for projecting comic ambiguity in language and movement can shine all the brighter, with an innocence beyond stain. It may be that without Setterfield as chief sounding board and accomplice he would not have developed his double edge at all - at least, not into the guileless satirical instrument it is now. (Arlene Croce, 1982) > > * > >> What [Gordon] is, I think, is a plasario punographer: playwright/impresario/punster/choreographer. He's also the dance world's leading humanist. His work has a warmth, a glow, a wry humor and an all- encompassing love for life. The quirks, foibles and impossible complexities of our urban environment are seen and shown as both invigorating and consoling, frustrating and stimulating. (Allen Robertson, 1982) Robertson, Allen (March 1982) \\"Clever Cookie\\" Ballet News > > * > >> ...Gordon, by nature, is a critic. His work both presents and comments on itself. ... Gordon at heart is a vaudevillian, a weaver of yarns, a coomposer of riddles, a magician confounding expectations. The basis of his work his movement. Photographic images, video, and, most important, the spoken and written word are collaborative elements. From these materials Gordon constructs dance anagrams, whose meaning and tone shift rapidly. ... Historian Sally Banes has compared Gordon's work to that of a cubist painter, noting his lamination of images, movements and words. Others have remarked on the inseparability of life and work in his performance pieces. (Sali Ann Krigsman, 1982) Krigsman, Sali Ann (1982) \\"Program Notes\\" from performances of T.V. Reel, Close Up, Double Identity and Dorothy & Eileen at the Baird Auditorium, National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C., November 1‚Äì2, 1982 Smithsonian Institution > > * > >> Formed by the polemical 1960s, Gordon seems to be, by nature, an ironist, with an appreciation of paradox, a fascination with the psychology of partnering, an ambivalence about glamour and fame. On occasion he has revealed a critical temperament and, in postmodern (or Balanchinian) fashion, an interest in layered allusions. He also husbands themes and effects. (Mindy Aloff, 1985) Aloff, Mindy (February 16, 1985) \\"Dance: Field, Chair and Mountain; Einstein on the Beach\\" The Nation > > * > >> Gordon is a true contrarian; he always seems to work against the grain. ... The mythology of [the Judson Dance Theatre] often equates the entire era with Yvonne Rainer's manifesto of renunciation. ... No to transformations and magic? Not for David Gordon. (Although it's essential to point out that his attitude toward transformation and magic has more in common with the work of hip, anti-illusionistic conjurors like Penn and Teller than with the overproduced, mysterioso/glitz of David Copperfield.) Gordon is the sort of magician who shows you where the rabbit is hiding in the hat. ... [H]e isn't the first choreographer to make a major contribution to the theatre. ... But Gordon is the first \\"dance person\\" who's as much a playwright as a choreographer. (Roger Copeland, 1996) > > * > >> David Gordon is no ordinary choreographer, He understands how to manipulate text and dance so that the result evokes an invigorating place, where thoughtful theater takes on the appearance of being casual. It never is just that. ... [He] plays with many pieces of seemingly disparate phrases before they are transformed into an eloquent whole. In many ways, he is a gleaner of his own work, which he files away with the possibility of revisiting it in the future. ... But as much as he revives material after recontextualizing it, most fundamental to the vitality of [his] repertory is not what the movement looks like or even what the words say, but the beguiling way in which they fit together. He is a director who knows dance. And even though there is a bit of everything in his work - humor, musicality, lush movement - he is unpredictable. (Gia Kourlas, 2002) Kourlas, Gia (January 6, 2002) \\"Rehearsing for Dance And for Life\\". The New York Times * >> >>> [P]erhaps what matters most to Mr. Gordon ‚Äî even more than the endlessly ambiguous overlaps of life and art ‚Äî is the way the present is the echo chamber of the past. [In The Matter at MoMA / 2018] you see younger dancers working on movement material that Mr. Gordon made years ago for Ms. Setterfield and himself; you see films and stills of Mr. Gordon and ‚Äî especially ‚Äî Ms. Setterfield.And you see films of great couples of old films: Lillian Gish and Richard Barthelmess in Broken Blossoms, Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard in Brief Encounter, Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift in A Place in the Sun. These screen relationships in turn become archetypes in whose shadows the Gordon-Setterfield partnership (like countless other romantic and marital relationships) has developed.(Alastair Macaulay, 2018) >> >> * >> >>> \\"Witty\\" may be dance critics' favorite word to describe David Gordon and Valda Setterfield. The pioneering director and dancer are renowned for the poignant humor of their work together - his uncanny sense of irony has found the ideal vehicle in her straitlaced, British facade. ...

The film was made by Paramount Pictures. The film is based on the 1921 French play, La huiti√®me femme de Barbe-Bleue, by Alfred Savoir and the English translation of the play by Charlton Andrews. The screenplay was the first of many collaborations between Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. A much-married business tycoon meets his match in his latest wife. The 1938 film was the year's 15th box-office success. It is a remake of the 1923 silent version directed by Sam Wood and starring Gloria Swanson. Plot On the French Riviera, wealthy businessman Michael Brandon wants to buy pajamas, but just the tops. When the store refuses to sell them without the pants, they are at an impasse. An attractive woman named Nicole offers to buy the bottoms. At the hotel where he is staying, Michael has trouble sleeping, so the managers offer him a suite on a higher floor, further away from the sounds of the sea. The suite is occupied by the Marquis de Loiselle, who is two months in arrears. The penniless marquis, as it turns out, had sent Michael a business proposition, which Michael turns down. The marquis then offers to sell him a bathtub supposedly once owned by King Louis XIV, which he also rejects. Then Michael recognizes the mismatched pajama bottoms the marquis is wearing and, after discovering that Nicole is the man's daughter, buys the bathtub. He then pursues Nicole and proposes to her the same day. She turns him down, but eventually changes her mind and accepts. However, she is horrified to learn that Michael has been married seven times before. She calls off the wedding, much to her father's dismay. Michael explains that he gives each of his wives a prenuptial agreement guaranteeing $50,000 a year for life if they divorce. He gives in when Nicole demands double that amount. During their honeymoon and afterward in their home in Paris, Nicole keeps her discontented husband at arm's length. He assumes that she is hoping to obtain a divorce, but that only strengthens his natural tenacity and his determination not to give her one. It is implied that what she actually wants is to keep him interested by means of frustration so that he won't get tired of her like the other seven. After reading Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, he tries to follow Petruchio's example, but Nicole proves too strong for him, slapping him back when he slaps her and biting him (then tenderly treating him with iodine) when he spanks her. She writes anonymous letters to him claiming that she has a lover, but Monsieur Pepinard, the private detective he hires, assures him that there is nothing to it. Nicole then blackmails Pepinard into finding her a fake lover, a boxer named Kid Mulligan, so Michael can catch her alone with him. Complications ensue when her friend Count Albert De Regnier picks the wrong time to return a purse she left behind and is mistaken for her husband by Kid Mulligan (and knocked out). Michael assumes that Albert is her lover and finally gives her a divorce. Six months later, Michael has a nervous breakdown. Nicole tries to see him in the sanitarium, but is not allowed in. Luckily, Michael has been put into a straitjacket after spotting her father, who has arranged for her to get in. Nicole tells Michael that she loved him at first sight, but had to break him of his habit of marrying so often. Now that she is financially independent, she explains, he can see that she does not want to (re)marry him for his money. He frees himself from his straitjacket, advances on her menacingly, then embraces her.

This ultimately led to his death.M Asher Cantrell, \\"The True Stories Behind 11 Famous Sideshow Performers\\", Mental Floss, June 28, 2016 Isaac bounced around from job to job during early adulthood. He worked as both a cobbler for his father and a grocer. However, his illness kept him from continuing down either of those career paths. His parents died and Sprague could not work enough to support himself, so he was left unemployed.\\"Isaac W. Sprague, The Original Thin Man\\", June 29, 2016 In 1865, he was offered a job at a circus sideshow, where he became known as \\"the Living Skeleton\\" or \\"the Original Thin Man\\". The next year P. T. Barnum hired Sprague to work at his (newly reopened) American Museum. Barnum paid Sprague $80 a week for his services. Sprague remembered the moment Barnum offered him the job: \\"Mr. Barnum stood very near me, and I overheard him say to his agent, 'Pretty lean man, where did you scare him up?'\\" Barnum's Museum burned down in 1868 and Sprague managed to escape with his life. At this point, Sprague took time off to marry his wife, Tamar Moore. They had three sons who lived healthy, normal lives. Sprague made attempts to stay away from the sideshow, but he could not escape financial distress. It is rumored that in addition to being financially responsible for his wife and their three sons, Sprague had a gambling problem. His condition also kept him from finding real work anywhere other than Barnum's. So he continued to tour off and on throughout the country and eventually overseas.The Human Marvels: Isaac W. Sprague By the age of 44, he was 5 feet and 6 inches (168 cm) tall with a weight of only 43 pounds (19.5 kg). Sprague's condition required him to be constantly taking in nutrients. His health was in such a poor state that he often carried milk in a flask around his neck. He would sip this from time to time to keep himself up and conscious. He died on January 5, 1887, in poverty, of asphyxia in Chicago, Illinois. Sprague was the first of many more Living Skeleton acts to come. In a result of forced promotion and work pressure, it was not uncommon for the Living Skeleton act to marry the Fat Lady act. Personal life  He married Miss Tamar Moore shortly after 1868 and the couple had three strong, healthy, robust sons. Sprague found happiness in his family.

It allows cases to be brought against suspects under international criminal law provisions, meaning that suspects can be prosecuted even though both they and their victims are foreigners and the crime itself took place abroad.Tobias Buck (29 October 2019), Germany charges two Syrians with crimes against humanity Financial Times. The VStGB was created to bring the German criminal law into accordance with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. It was announced on 26 June 2002 and became law 30 June 2002. Contents The VStGB covers the following offenses: *Genocide (¬ß 6) *Crimes against humanity (¬ß 7) *War crimes (¬ß¬ß 8‚Äì12) None of these are subject to a statute of limitations (¬ß 5). The general principles of criminal law under the Strafgesetzbuch (German penal code) remain applicable, unless otherwise provided (¬ß 2). As a novelty under German criminal law, provisions on superior responsibility are established (¬ß¬ß 4, 13, 14). Acting upon superior orders may only exculpate a perpetrator of international crimes in exceptional circumstances (¬ß 3). According to ¬ß 1, genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes are subject to universal jurisdiction, thus German courts can punish offenses committed by foreign citizens abroad. Prosecutorial jurisdiction lies with the Public Prosecutor General. Competent courts at first instance are the Oberlandesgerichte (Higher Regional Courts). The prosecution of crimes committed outside German jurisdiction is limited by ¬ß 153f of the German Criminal Procedural Code, which gives the Public Prosecutor General a wide discretion of when to open a case via universal jurisdiction, if the offender is not of German nationality. So far the Public Prosecutor General's office has suspended persecator measures for 128 cases brought to its attention involving international crimes pursuant to the German International Criminal Code. Notable cases In May 2011, the trial of two Rwandan citizens, Ignace Murwanashyaka and Straton Musoni, began before the Higher Regional Court in Stuttgart. This was the first trial under the VStGB in Germany.

Plot Julia Scott (Claudette Colbert) is a very efficient secretary at a department store. She is in love with her boss, Richard Barclay (Melvyn Douglas), who pays no attention to her, unless it has to do with business. Julia goes to lunch with Martha Pryor (Jean Dixon), who tells her she is offered a manager position of a department store in Paris. She turns it down, because of her love for Richard. Business forces Julia and Richard to work late at his house. Julia meets Richard's sister, Gertrude, and his daughter, Annabel, who is a very spoiled, out of control child. Richard lets Julia take over the house for a couple of hours, in which she \\"straightens out\\" the household. Afterwards, she regrets all that she did at Richard's house. She turns to Martha, who says she'll take care of everything. Martha talks to Richard the next day, telling him that Julia is leaving and taking the job in Paris. Richard is very upset, and wants to know why. She struggles to come up with excuses, and they take the afternoon off, during which Richard and Julia are married. When Julia insists on being carried over the thresh-hold of his home. Gertrude is not happy, and insists the marriage will not last. The next day, Julia decides to stay home and attend to business there. The office is a complete disaster that day, in complete chaos. Meanwhile, Annabel has refused to eat anything while Julia is in the house, but Julia continues to outsmart and \\"befriends her, along with Rodgers, a prospective business partner. Gertrude continues to try and ruin the marriage. While Julia and Rodgers are working, Annabel enters, and they all start singing. Richard comes home and is very upset with Julia. He would rather have her helping him get the business deal with Rodgers. Julia decides to go down to Philadelphia and \\"get the Rodgers place in order.\\" But after a while Annabelle wants Julia to come home, so Richard decides to go down to Philadelphia and bring his wife back. The night before he arrives, Julia and Rodgers drink heavily and spend the night in the store front window singing. Richard sees photos of the incident in the newspaper, and storms out of Julia's hotel room after she insists he cares more about the store than about her. Julia feels the marriage is over, and makes plans for a cruise to Cuba and Panama with Rodgers. As she stops by home to pick up her things, Annabel begs her to stay. Richard, usually a teetotaller, has been getting drunk with his butler. When he finds out Julia is in the house, he confronts her drunkenly, then pretends to have a gun in his pocket and forces her into a car being driven by the intoxicated butler. The car careens through the city to a brickyard, where Richard picks up bricks, and then returns to the store. Both he and Julia throw bricks through the store window, laughing. As the police chase them, they rush to the pier, with the goal of departing on the cruise to Cuba together.

Eve in 1904. The Royal Society of Painter- Printmakers (RE), known until 1991 as the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, is a leading art institution based in London, England. The Royal Society of Painter-Etchers, as it was originally styled, was a society of etchers established in London in 1880 and given a Royal Charter in 1888. Engraving was included within the scope of the Society from 1897, wood- engraving from 1920, coloured original prints from 1957, lithography from 1987 and all forms of creative forward-thinking original printmaking from 1990. History The Society was established on 31 July 1880 at 38 Hertford Street, Mayfair, London, as the Society of Painter-Etchers for the promotion of original etching as a creative art form, inspired by the French group of the same name which existed in Paris. The first six Fellows, all elected at this formation were Francis Seymour Haden (English, 1818‚Äì1910); Heywood Hardy (English, 1852‚Äì1926); Hubert von Herkomer RA (German/English, 1849‚Äì1914); Alphonse Legros (French, 1837‚Äì1911); Robert Walker Macbeth RA, (Scottish, 1848‚Äì1910), and James Tissot (French, 1836‚Äì1902). Samuel Palmer (English, 1805‚Äì1881) ‚Äì the only painter-etcher to be granted a posthumous Honorary Fellowship of the RE ‚Äì was terminally ill at the time of the Society‚Äôs formation, otherwise would have been approached. James McNeill Whistler (American, 1834‚Äì1903) who was in Venice at the time of the RE‚Äôs founding, had a row with his brother-in-law, Haden, and was not invited to join. Letters in support were written to the fledging Society by Frederick Leighton, then President of the Royal Academy, John Ruskin, Charles Dickens, John Everett Millais, and Auguste Rodin, amongst others. This Society achieved its Royal Charter granted by Queen Victoria in 1888 who bestowed on the President a gold chain of office, becoming the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and in 1898 this was enlarged to include Engravers. Fellow, George W. Eve, designed a new Associates and Fellows diploma in 1893 and 1904.Viner, George H. (1916) A descriptive catalogue of the bookplates designed and etched by George W. Eve, R.E. Kansas City: The American Bookplate Society, p. 7. By 1911, when HM King George V granted a Charter of Incorporation and Bye-laws, the RE, as it came to be styled, had grown in prestige and became fully established. From 1919, in token of solidarity, Presidents of the Royal Academy and the Royal Watercolour Society (RWS) have been elected Honorary Fellows of the RE. The RE‚Äôs original motto ‚Äì \\"Never Stoop to be a Copyist\\" ‚Äì changed to \\"Nulla Dies Sine Linea\\" (No Day Without A Line) in 1920. The Royal Society of Painter- Printmakers (formerly Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers) has had thirteen presidents (PRE) in total since 1880. They were: Sir Francis Seymour Haden (founder and PRE from 1880‚Äì1910), Professor Sir Francis Job Short (PRE from 1910‚Äì1938), Professor Malcolm Osborne MBE (PRE from 1938‚Äì1962), Professor Robert Austin (PRE from 1962‚Äì1970), Paul Drury (PRE from 1970‚Äì1975), Harry Eccleston OBE (PRE from 1975‚Äì1989), and Joseph Winkelman (PRE from 1989‚Äì1991), when the Society was renamed. Winkelman continued as President until 1995. Presidents elected by Members after this were Dr David Carpanini (PRE from 1995‚Äì2003), Anita Klein (PRE from 2003‚Äì2006), Hilary Paynter (PRE from 2006‚Äì2011), Dr Bren Unwin (PRE from 2011‚Äì2013), Mychael Barratt (PRE from 2013‚Äì2018). The current President of the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers is Professor Dr David Ferry (2018‚Äìpresent). The current Vice-President of the RE is Michelle Griffiths (VPRE from 2018) and the current Hon. Secretary of the RE is Jane Stobart (Hon. Sec. RE from 2017). Membership Membership, which was and still is restricted in number in order to make it a mark of distinction, is by election on the basis of work submitted to the Society‚Äôs Council for peer review. In 1920 membership was expanded to allow artists who created prints from media other than metal, which allowed the election of woodcut artists such as Gwen Raverat and Noel Rooke. Another innovation in the same year was the formation of a Print Collectors' Club to be limited to 300 members each of whom received a commissioned annual presentation print by members of the RE. Unusual in any Royal Society was the fact that work by women and men was treated equally from the outset: election based on the quality of work regardless of gender and nationality. Full Fellows are entitled to use the post-nominals RE. Associates, a class of members established in 1887, can use ARE. ARE‚Äôs are elevated to RE full membership by majority vote election by the RE Council. Notable members (and their date of election to a full fellowship) included: Mary Nimmo Moran (1881), William Strang (1881), Joseph Pennell (1882), Auguste Rodin (1882), Charles William Sherborn (1884), Herbert Dicksee (1885), Walter Sickert (1887), Sir David Young Cameron (1895), Margaret Kemp-Welch (1901), Sir Frank Brangwyn (1903), Anna Airy (1908), Eug√®ne B√©jot (1908), Ernest Stephen Lumsden (1915), William Walcot (1920), Edmund Blampied (1921), Gerald Brockhurst (1921), Robert Austin (1927), Dame Laura Knight (1932), Sir William Russell Flint (1933), Charles Tunnicliffe (1934), Geoffrey Wedgwood (1934), Joan Hassall (1948), James T.A. Osborne (1957), Gwenda Morgan (1962), and Robert Tavener (1966). Others were elected as an Associate but did not achieve the full fellowship, such as Eli Marsden Wilson (1907), John Nicolson (1923) and Salomon van Abb√© (1923).

(Cantab.) M.R.C.P., etc. (1847‚Äì1920) was a medical electrician at St. Thomas Hospital, London. There, from 1879 to 1893, he was in charge of electrotherapy. He was also in private medical practice, in Ladbroke Grove, London. He wrote papers on a range of subjects but is today best remembered for his late study The Human Atmosphere. In 1883, he became a Member of the Royal College of Physicians. In his spare time he was a keen chess player. The Human Atmosphere In 1911 Kilner published one of the first western medical studies of the \\"Human Atmosphere\\" or Aura, proposing its existence, nature and possible use in medical diagnosis and prognosis. In its conviction that the human energy field is an indicator of health and mood, Kilner's study resembles the later work of Harold Saxton Burr. However, while Burr relied upon voltmeter readings, Kilner, working before the advent of semiconductor technology, attempted to invent devices by which the naked eye might be trained to observe \\"auric\\" activity which, he hypothesised, was probably ultraviolet radiation, stating that the phenomena he saw were not affected by electromagnets.Kilner, Walter J., The Human Atmosphere, or the Aura Made Visible by the aid of Chemical Screens, 1911, reprinted as \\"The Human Aura\\" by Citadel Press, NY, 1965, . The Aura, by Walter J. Kilner. Introd. by Sibyl Ferguson. New York, S. Weiser, 1973. Glass slides or \\"Kilner Screens\\"Raymond J. Corsini The Dictionary of Psychology, Psychology Press 1999 p.524 containing alcoholic solutions of variously coloured dyes, including a blue coal-tar dye called \\"dicyanin\\" were used as filters in \\"Kilner Goggles\\" which, together with lights, were held to train the eyes to perceive electromagnetic radiation outside the normal spectrum of visible light.Williams, William F. (2002). Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy. Facts on File Inc. pp. 176‚Äì177. After being so trained, one could dispense with the apparatus. Kilner did not recommend merely viewing the subject through these lenses. According to his study, Kilner and his associates were able, on many occasions, to perceive auric formations, which he called the Etheric Double, the Inner Aura and the Outer Aura, extending several inches from patients' naked bodies, and his book gave instructions by which the reader might construct and use similar goggles. Francis J. Rebman, a friend of Kilner supported his research in America.The Daily Journal-Gazette from Mattoon, Illinois. 19 August 1911. p. 3. Rebman published a booklet on the subject The Human Aura: A Brief Explication of Dr. Kilner's Discovery of Means for Observing the Human Atmosphere. (1912). A drawback to Kilner's method was the scarcity and toxicity of the chemicals he recommended. Later, the biologist Oscar BagnallBagnall, Oscar. (1937). The Origin and Properties of the Human Aura. Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner and Company. recommended substituting the dye pinacyanol (dissolved in triethanolamine) but this dye is also not easy to obtain. Carl Edwin Lindgren has stated that cobalt blue and purple glass may be substituted for the dyes used by Kilner and Bagnall.Lindgren, Carl Edwin. (2005). Capturing the Aura. Blue Dolphin Publishing. p. 16. In 1920 a revised edition of his book was published under the title The Human Aura. Kilner's work was well-timed for the heyday of Theosophy and his findings were incorporated into Arthur E. Powell's book The Etheric Double.Powell, Arthur E. (1925). The Etheric Double and Allied Phenomena. Theosophical Publishing House. Powell rightly made clear that Kilner had expressly differentiated between his own work and the clairvoyance and eastern systems of spiritualism. Critical reception In the British Medical Journal (BMJ) a review for Kilner's research stated that although Kilner contended the aura is a \\"purely physical phenomenon\\", evidence does not support this view.

We honur Johnny Pilkington every harvest on the first match of each month by sacurficing the blood of a county player . Johnny then regals us of his past glorys. We call this Johnny appreciation day. Pilkington made his first appearance for the team during the 1988‚Äì89 National League and subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 2001 championship. During that time he won two All-Ireland medals, four Leinster, one National Hurling League medal and one All-Star award. Pilkington was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. At club level Pilkington is one of only a handful of players to have won four All-Ireland medals. In addition to this he has also won six Leinster medals and eight county club championship medals with Birr. Pilkington's older brother, Declan, also played hurling with Offaly. Playing career=Club= Pilkington played his club hurling with Birr and enjoyed much success in a lengthy career. After enjoying some success at underage levels, he subsequently joined the Birr senior hurling team. Having lost the championship decider in 1990, Birr bounced back the following year by reaching the final again. A 1‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì11 defeat of Seir Kieran gave Pilkington his first championship medal. It was Birr's first county title in twenty years. Pilkington later collected a Leinster medal following a 2‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì3 thrashing of Ballyhale Shamrocks. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Birr take on Kiltormer of Galway, however, a 0‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì8 defeat was Pilkington's lot on that occasion. After a number of years without success, Birr returned to the big time in 1994. A narrow 0‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì6 defeat of Seir Kieran gave Pilkington a second championship medal. He later won a second Leinster medal following a defeat of Oulart the Ballagh before lining out in a second All-Ireland final. Dunloy of Antrim were the opponents and provided stiff opposition to a Birr team who were lucky to escape with a 0‚Äì9 apiece draw. The replay was much more conclusive with Birr recording a 3‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì3 win. It was Pilkington's first All-Ireland medal. In 1997 Pilkington won a third county championship medal following another 0‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì4 defeat of Seir Kieran. He later added a third Leinster medal to his collection following an 0‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì5 defeat of Castletown. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Birr take on Sarsfield's of Galway. Darren Hanniffy scored the only goal of the game after just five minutes and gave Birr a lead that they would never surrender. A 1‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì9 victory gave Pilkington his second All-Ireland medal. After surrendering their titles the following year, Birr bounced back in 1999. A 3‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì11 defeat of St. Rynagh's gave Pilkington a fourth championship medal. A subsequent 1‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì11 defeat of Castletown gave Pilkington a fourth Leinster medal. Pilington won further championship medals in 2000 and 2001 as Birr retained their status as the kingpins of Offaly hurling. Once again Birr defeated Castletown in the provincial decider to give Pilkington his fifth Leinster medal. Once again Birr qualified for the All-Ireland final with Clarinbridge providing the opposition. A Declan Pilkington goal inside sixty seconds was the perfect start, although the Westerners did recover to lead by 1‚Äì4 to 1 -2 at the break. With wind advantage, Birr took control and secured a 2‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì5 victory. It was Pilkington's third All-Ireland medal. Birr continued their dominance in 2002 with Pilkington winning a seventh championship medal following a 3‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì7 defeat of Kilcormac-Killoughey. He later added a sixth Leinster medal to his collection following a 2‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì2 defeat of Young Irelands in deplorable conditions. Birr later faced Dunloy in the All-Ireland decider. At the third time of asking Birr finally retained the title with a 1‚Äì19 to 0‚Äì11 victory. It was Pilkington's record-breaking fourth All-Ireland medal. In 2003 Birr defeated Ballyskenach by 1‚Äì18 to 1‚Äì11 to secure their fifth successive county championship. It was Pilkington's eighth and final championship medal. =Inter-county= Pilkington first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Offaly minor hurling team in 1987. He won a Leinster medal that year following 1 2‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì12 defeat of Kilkenny before later lining out in the All-Ireland final. Tipperary provided the opposition on that occasion, however, 2‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì12 score line gave Pilkington an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. Pilkington made his senior debut for Offaly in a National League game against Meath during the 1988‚Äì89 campaign. He later lined out in his first championship game against Laois before winning his first Leinster medal following a 3‚Äì15 to 4‚Äì9 defeat of Kilkenny. Antrim subsequently pulled off the hurling shock of the century with a 4‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì15 defeat of Offaly in the All-Ireland semi-final. Offaly once again dominated the provincial championship in 1990. A 1‚Äì19 to 2‚Äì11 defeat of Dublin gave Pilkington his second Leinster medal as Offaly completed their first and only hat-trick of provincial titles. The team subsequently faced a third All-Ireland semi-final defeat. He finished off the year by collecting his sole All-Star award. The success continued in 1991 with Pilkington collecting a National League medal following a 2‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì10 defeat of Wexford. In 1994 Offaly returned to the top of the provincial pile. A 1‚Äì18 to 0‚Äì14 defeat of Wexford gave Pilkington his third Leinster medal. After defeating Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final, he later lined out against Limerick in his first All-Ireland final appearance. With five minutes left in the game Limerick were five points ahead and were coasting to victory. It was then that one of the most explosive All-Ireland final finishes of all-time took place. Offaly were awarded a close-in free which Johnny Dooley stepped up to take. Dooley was told by the management team to take a point; however, he lashed the ball into the Limerick net to reduce the deficit. Following the puck-out Offaly worked the ball up the field and Pat O'Connor struck for a second goal. The Offaly forwards scored another five unanswered points in the time remaining to secure a 3‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì13 victory. This sensational victory gave Pilkington a first All-Ireland medal. Offaly retained the Leinster title following a 2‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì5 trouncing of Kilkenny in 1995. It was Pilkington's fourth provincial medal. Down fell to Offaly in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final, allowing Offaly to advance to the championship decider and attempt to put back-to-back All-Ireland titles together for the first time ever. It was the first-ever meeting of Offaly and Clare in the history of the championship. The game developed into a close affair with Offaly taking a half-time lead. Four minutes from the end substitute √âamonn Taaffe first timed a long range free straight into the net to give Clare a one-point lead. After a quick equaliser Anthony Daly sent over a 65-metre free to give his team the lead again. Jamesie O'Connor pointed soon afterwards and at the full-time whistle Clare were the 1‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì8 winners. After a couple of seasons in the doldrums Offaly emerged again in 1998, however, the year was not without controversy. That year Pilkington's side reached the Leinster final but lost by five points to Kilkenny. This defeat prompted their manager, Babs Keating, to describe the Offaly hurlers as \\"sheep in a heap\\", and he promptly resigned. It looked as if Offaly's championship hopes were in disarray, however, they overcame Antrim in the All-Ireland quarter-final and qualified to meet Clare in the semi-final. That game ended in a draw 1‚Äì13 apiece draw and had to be replayed. The replay, however, was ended early because of a time-keeping error by the referee Jimmy Cooney. Following a protest on the pitch of Croke Park by the Offaly supporters it was decided that Clare and Offaly would meet for a third time. Pilkington's side won the third game and qualified to play Kilkenny in the final in a repeat of the provincial decider. On that day Brian Whelahan delivered one of his greatest performances. Despite suffering from flu, he started in defence and was later moved to full-forward where he scored 1‚Äì6. Offaly reversed the Leinster final defeat by winning the All-Ireland final by six points. Pilkington secured a second All-Ireland medal. Offaly surrendered their championship crown the following year but returned to the All-Ireland decider again in 2000 in a repeat of the Leinster final. Kilkenny's D.J. Carey capitalised on an Offaly mistake after just six minutes to start a goal-fest for \\"the Cats\\". Carey scored 2‚Äì4 in all, sharing his second goal with Henry Shefflin who also scored a goal in the second-half. At the full-time whistle Kilkenny were the champions by 5‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì14. Following a humiliating 3‚Äì21 to 0‚Äì18 defeat by Kilkenny in the 2001 Leinster semi-final, Pilkington announced his retirement from inter-county hurling. Managerial career=Offaly minor= Pilkington succeeded Ger Coughlan as Offaly minor hurling team manager in late 2007. During his two seasons in charge he enjoyed little success. His opening game in 2008 saw Offaly face a comprehensive defeat by Carlow, while Westmeath got the better of Pilkington's charges in 2009. =Kilcormac-Killoughey= Pilkington was appointed manager of the Kilcormac-Killoughey senior hurling team in late 2008. In his debut season in charge he guided the team to the championship decider. A 2‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì11 defeat was Pilkington's lot on that occasion. Kilcormac-Killoughey were defeated by the same opposition in controversial circumstances at the semi-final stages of the championship in 2010.

It currently has two operating mines in Africa; the Langer Heinrich mine (LHM) in Namibia, and the Kayelekera mine (KM) in Malawi. Paladin was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and Namibian Stock Exchange (NSX), as well as the Munich, Berlin, Stuttgart, and Frankfurt Exchanges. It also owns deposits in Western Australia. As of February 2018, Paladin is in the process of restructuring, having filed for insolvency in July 2017. History Uranerz Australia started operations in Perth, Western Australia, in 1970 with John Borshoff, Paladin's managing director/CEO, serving as Chief executive from 1986 to 1991. Uranerz, the Australian arm of German-based uranium mining house Uranerzbergbau, explored throughout Australia, New Zealand, and Africa, focusing primarily on uranium. When Uranerz decided to close its Australian operations, John Borshoff acquired its extensive proprietary databases, which subsequently formed the nucleus for the public float of Paladin in 1994. In February 2008, Paladin, in conjunction with joint venture partner Cameco, were selected from a highly competitive field to explore the Angela and Pamela deposits located approximately 25 km south of the town of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. Following successful completion of 2 drilling programmes, an updated Mineral Resource estimate was completed by the JV partners in July 2011. In February 2009, Paladin completed the takeover of Fusion Resources, adding the Duke Batman and Honey Pot deposits to the existing Mount Isa project area. The capacity of the LHM operation has been successfully expanded to a production rate of 5.2Mlb per annum. According to information released by Wikileaks in 2010, BHP Billiton attempted to lobby the Australian government in order to block the Aluminium Corp of China (Chinalco) investment in Rio Tinto. In 2012, Paladin joined forces with Rio Tinto to block the sales of BHP Billiton's Australian uranium deposit to Canadian mining company, Cameco. Founder of Paladin, John Borshoff stepped down as CEO in 2015 as part of a board decision. Alexander Molyneux, took over as interim CEO of the company.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/business-spectator/paladin- ceo-founder-stands-down/news-story/96e7d67c3b2d92d91c60ddedea41334a In 2016, The Australian reported that Paladin may be in talks with Russian owned ARMZ Uranium Holding as well as China National Nuclear Corporation. CNNC is a 25% owner in Paladin's Namibian mine Langer Heinrich. Paladin posted a loss of $22,9 million after tax in the six months to 31 December 2015. In 2016, Paladin announced the sale of non-core Australian exploration assets to Uranium Africa. The value of the sale was A$2.5 million and included the Oobagoma project in Western Australia and Pamela/Angela project in the Northern Territory. In 2017, Paladin filed for insolvency, due to its high debt and consistently low uranium prices. The stock was also delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange. In June 2018, former Newcrest executive Scott Sullivan was appointed to take over the CEO responsibilities from Alexander Molyneux.https://www.asx.com.au/asx/statistics/displayAnnouncement.do?display=pdf&idsId;=01989649 Uranium projects  The Company‚Äôs uranium projects include Langer Heinrich in Namibia; Kayelekera in Malawi; and Manyingee in Western Australia. Each of these projects had feasibility studies carried out by previous owners during the 1980s, and Paladin secured them at low cost during the depressed uranium market. Paladin has augmented its resource base in Australia through the acquisition of Valhalla Uranium Pty Ltd, whose primary assets are the 50% joint venture interests in the Valhalla and Skal deposits near Mount Isa in Queensland and 41.71% ownership of the Bigrlyi deposit in the Northern Territory. Paladin also has an 82.08% controlling interest in Summit Resources Limited, Valhalla's joint venture partner at Mount Isa and the holder of other promising exploration titles in the region. African Focus= Namibia = Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia is Paladin's flagship project. Having reached its initial production of 2.7Mlb U3O8 per annum in 2008, the mine completed its Stage 2 ramp-up to 3.7Mlb per annum in the 2010 financial year. Subsequently, the Company has completed a Stage 3 expansion and began producing at a 5.2Mlb per annum rate. An additional Stage 4 expansion review is currently nearing finalisation with the view to potentially increasing production up to 10Mlb per annum at a later date when the economics justify the additional investment required. Substantial technical work has been completed on this project since its discovery in 1973, mainly by Gencor (the original explorer), a large South African mining house that evolved into BHP Billiton. Paladin acquired Langer Heinrich in 2002, and started a BFS in 2004. Paladin's Board approved the development proposal at a capital cost of US$92M in 2005; site works began in September 2005;and, the project construction was completed on time and within budget. The mine was officially opened by the President of the Republic of Namibia in March 2007. In July 2016, it was reported that Paladin was looking to sell a further 24% stake in the Langer Heinrich mine to an unnamed buyer. In subsequent reports, it was stated that the buyer would be a division of the state-owned China National Nuclear Corp (CNNC). The value is expected to be $175 million. However, in December 2016, Paladin reported that the sale had been delayed. = Malawi = Kayelekera mine in Malawi is the Company's second mine. A Development Agreement with the Government of Malawi was executed in February 2007, which provided fiscal stability for the project for ten years. Kayelekera was officially opened in April 2009 and has operated at designed production rates of 3.3Mlb U3O8. Project life is expected to run for at least an additional 8 years with exploration underway to identify feedstocks to extend the current project life. The uranium development in Malawi has been besieged by issues and international media attention since 2008. A report presented by the United Nations Human Rights Commission argued that Malawi would lose money and resources over the life of the mine. In 2014, Paladin suspended production at Kayelekera, citing lowered uranium prices at the reason for suspension. Canada In February 2011, Paladin completed the acquisition of its first Canadian project. Paladin acquired the uranium assets of Canadian company Aurora Energy Resources Inc. (Aurora) which added a significant tenement package in the highly prospective Central Mineral Belt (CMB) in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Aurora had already established a Mineral Resource base of 40.2Mt at 0.09% U3O8 (83.8Mlb) of Measured and Indicated category material, with an additional 29.0Mt at 0.08% U3O8 (53.0Mlb) of Inferred category resources. In 2015, the Canadian Federal government granted an exemption to the current regulations on foreign ownership of active producing mines in Canada. Paladin was granted the right to have a majority ownership stake in the Michelin uranium mine, located in Newfoundland. Paladin was able to secure the exemption by demonstrating that no suitable Canadian owned company was attracted to the venture. Australian Uranium Mining Ban A uranium mining ban dating back to 1989 had been in place, hindering the group's Australian activities for more than a decade. This ban was overturned in October 2012, paving the way for firms like Paladin to take advantage of the vast resources available; exploration had not been prohibited and thus the reserves have been targeted and are ready for mining. However, it was not all of Australia that lifted the ban. In 2015, the state of Queensland reinstated the ban on all uranium mining activity. South Australia is still undertaking research into the effect of uranium mining in the state. Mining is still banned in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. Paladin owns the Valhalla deposit with both measured and indicated uranium resources of 24,425tU.

She was put on trial for having served in the military posing as a man and for marrying a woman. She has been the object of plays, literature, research and exhibitions.  Background  Ulrika Eleonora St√•lhammar was born to lieutenant-colonel Johan St√•lhammar (1653-1711) and Anna Brita Lood (d. 1699). Her exact year of birth is not confirmed, as the church documents are missing for the 1680s. The year 1683 is traditionally given because her age at the time of her death in 1733 is given as 50 years old. In any event, she was born after her elder sister Elisabet Catharina, who was born in 1680, and before the eldest of her younger sisters, Brita Christina, who was born in 1689,Gustaf Elgenstierna, Den introducerade svenska adelns √§ttartavlor. 1925-36. and 1683 or 1688 are often given as her year of birth. She had five sisters: Elisabet Catharina (1680-1730), Brita Christina (1689-1749), Maria Sofia (1690-1766), Gustaviana Margareta (1691-?) and Anna Brita (1696-1756). Her father Johan St√•lhammar was himself a veteran of the war, but became almost ruined after his retirement in 1702. She was raised at Stensj√∂ manor. Ulrika later stated she had always enjoyed the tasks usually given to men, that she had hardly learned any of the tasks normally performed by females at all. She said that people who had seen her hunt and ride had told her that it was a shame that she was not a man, so her talents would have \\"been put to better use in the world\\".Borgstr√∂m Eva, ed (2002). Makal√∂sa kvinnor: k√∂ns√∂verskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous Women: genderbenders in myth and reality) Stockholm: Alfabeta/Anamma. Libris 8707902. (inb.)(Swedish) After the death of her heavily indebted father in 1711, she and her five sisters were left without money, and the family estate was mortgaged. They relied on the charity of relatives and entered into arranged marriages with people whom they considered to be below their standards in order to support themselves: within four years of her father's death, all her sisters were married. Ulrika, who had watched her sisters enter unpleasant marriages, did not wish to marry, and in March 1713, she dressed herself in her father's clothes, stole a horse from the stable and ran away from home. Reportedly she \\"escaped a proposed marriage which was for her unpleasant\\". She took on the name of Vilhelm Edstedt. She had the plan to enlist in the army from the beginning, and \\"long searched for an opportunity to enlist, working until then as taffelt√§ckare for Governor Mannerborg in √Öbo, and as a servant to guard lieutenant Casper Johan Berch\\".  Military career and marriage  Ulrika Eleonora St√•lhammar finally enlisted in the army as an artillerist in Kalmar on 15 October 1715 under the name of Vilhelm Edstedt. She did not participate in active warfare, as she was posted in the garrison of Kalmar, which did not see any action during the Great Northern War. Nevertheless, she was successful in her professional conduct and was eventually promoted to the rank of corporal. Reportedly, she preferred to rent a room rather than to sleep in the barracks. This was permitted and acceptable, though somewhat unusual among common soldiers, who normally preferred not to spend their meager salary on special sleeping arrangements. On New Year's Eve 1716, she became engaged to a maid named Maria L√∂nnman, and married her 15 April of that year. It was later reported that L√∂hnman thought that St√•lhammar was impotent, but that she was content to live without sex, as she had previously been the victim of rape. Ulrika eventually revealed her sex, and they continued to live happily in what was later described as a union of \\"spiritual love\\".Alf √Öberg (Swedish) : Karolinska Kvinno√∂den (Fates of Carolinian Women) In 1724, her sister Elisabet Catharina learned of what she had done. Shocked over both the cross dressing and the same sex marriage, she wrote to Ulrika that she had committed a \\"sin against the will of God\\". Ulrika promised her sister to leave the army, but she did not do this until 25 August 1726. She wrote to her wealthy aunt, the widow of her late uncle, the landowner Sofia Drake, and asked for protection for Maria and herself. Sofia Drake had her son bring Ulrika Eleonora and Maria from Kalmar. Drake arranged for St√•lhammar to be housed with relatives in the country in V√§rmland, so that she could gradually get used to wearing women's clothing again, while Maria was given refuge at the mansion of Drake, Salshult outside Vetlanda in Sm√•land.Larsson, Olle, Stormaktens sista krig: Sverige och stora nordiska kriget 1700-1721, Historiska media, Lund, 2009 At one point, the couple managed to meet at the estate of the royal equarry Silfversparre at Gullaskruv, were Maria were temporarily given refuge: it is not mentioned under which circumstances they met. Maria L√∂nman apparently made a good impression on Drake.  Trial and verdict To pose as a member of the opposite sex was, under the current law, a serious religious crime which could be punishable by death. Rumors were spreading about St√•lhammar. In midsummer 1728, on the advice of her family, Ulrika went to Helsing√∂r in Denmark, and wrote a letter of confession to the Swedish government and asked for its pardon. St√•lhammar asked the King for pardon because of: \\"My weak sex, who if only with the deepest humility, loyalty and steadfastness in ten years served the Swedish crown\\". She returned to Sofia Drake at Salshult, from where she reported herself to the authorities in J√∂nk√∂ping. On 10 February 1729, Ulrika Eleonora St√•lhammar and Maria L√∂nman were put on trial in Kalmar. The court of Kalmar did not know under what charge they should be prosecuted, and consulted the high court G√∂ta hovr√§tt in J√∂nk√∂ping. After consulting the Bible, St√•lhammar was charged with having \\"violated the order of God\\" by dressing as a man, and with \\"making a mockery of marriage\\" by marrying a member of the same sex. St√•lhammar was also charged for having married a member of the same sex, Maria L√∂hnman. She confessed that she had been taken by \\"a strong love\\" for L√∂hnman and had decided \\"to live and to die with her\\". She claimed to have fallen in love with her during a dream, and proposed to her. After some time of courting and correspondence, L√∂hnman had accepted her proposal. Fourteen days after their wedding, St√•lhammar, \\"after many sighs and tears\\", had confessed to L√∂hnman that she was perhaps not the \\"right man\\", and revealed herself. Maria L√∂hnman had reproached her, but promised not to reveal her so as not to cause her harm and finally said: \\"If it is so, do not mourn. Thanks to God, that has never been a concern for me\\". Maria L√∂hnman testified that she had initially thought St√•lhammar to be a hermaphrodite. But she confessed that she had loved St√•lhammar even more since she had found out her true sex, and that she could never have betrayed her but instead prayed to God that the matter would never be revealed and that St√•lhammar would not be called out to serve so that they could be with each other forever. The couple both denied to the court that they had any sexual contact with each other. Before St√•lhammar revealed herself, L√∂hnman had laid upon her arm, nothing more. St√•lhammar also claimed that she had fallen in love with L√∂hnman because of her virtue, and several witnesses testified that the couple was known for their virtue. When the court asked St√•lhammar how she could have lived a married life for ten years without men, she replied that: \\"as she, thanks to God, never had any debauched thoughts and even less so any natural lust, there was never any need for her to associate with any male person\\". The court asked L√∂hnman if she and St√•lhammar ever \\"had any of the love exercise of the sort married couples have?\\", upon which she answered: \\"No, she never did nor invite it\\". The court was curious as to how St√•lhammar had managed to pass for a male, and had a midwife examine her physically. The midwife reported that she was completely normally developed, except for being unusually flat chested for a woman. However, the judges were also impressed and intrigued with her. She was from Sm√•land, which reminded people of the legendary female warrior Blenda, who was also from Sm√•land. Her aunt, Sofia Drake, also made a \\"powerful intervention\\" to her behalf, which is regarded to have worked in her favor.Harrison, Dick, Jourhavande historiker, Norstedt, Stockholm, 2013 The court G√∂ta hovr√§tt passed the sentence that the marriage had broken the law of God and nature, but acquitted them from the charge of homosexuality, as they decided to believe the testimonies that the couple had lived in a marriage without sex. This caused the judges to view the marriage favorably, as it was \\"of the purest, most spiritual kind, a union of virtue\\". On 18 December 1729, Ulrika Eleonora St√•lhammar was judged guilty of having posed as a man and marrying a woman. These were crimes which formally meant a death sentence, but St√•lhammar's sentences was limited to one month imprisonment on water and bread, followed by pillorying and exile from Kalmar. Maria L√∂nman was sentenced to 14 days imprisonment for having neglected to reveal the truth. On 30 January 1730, King Frederick I of Sweden reduced St√•lhammar's sentences by removing the specification of \\"water and bread\\", while Maria L√∂nman's sentence was reduced to eight days. After having served their sentences, the couple lived a quiet life on the estates of Ulrika's relatives. Ulrika Eleonora St√•lhammar lived at Hultsj√∂ Manor outside S√§vsj√∂, with her Elisabet Ramsv√§rd, widow after colonel lieutenancy Erik Silfversparre: her daughter Margareta Elisabet was married to Ulrika Eleonora's cousin Otto Fredrik St√•lhammar, the son of Sofia Drake. Maria L√∂hnman was employed as a housekeeper to St√•lhammar's aunt, Sofia Drake af Torp och Hamra, at Salshult Manor outside Vetlanda. Letters display Ulrika St√•lhammar's and Maria L√∂hnman's love for each other. Ulrika died in 1733, and Maria continued as a housekeeper for Ulrika's aunt and later her cousin until her death on 16 May 1761.  Context  During the early modern age, there were several cases of women serving in the Swedish army posing as men. Previously, there had been the case of Brita Olofsdotter, who served in the Swedish cavalry in the war in Livonia in 1569, and the case of Lisbetha Olsdotter, was convicted and executed for serving as a soldier under the name of Mats Ersson. These cases did in fact reach something of a peak during the early 18th century. Contemporary to Ulrika Eleonora St√•lhammar, Anna J√∂ransdotter and Margareta Elisabeth Roos both served in the army of Charles XII of Sweden during the Great Northern War: in the case of Roos it was unconfirmed, as she was never put on trial, but Anna J√∂ransdotter served under the name Johan Haritu until she was discovered in 1714, and a third woman is known to have been whipped for her service as a soldier during the campaign in Norway, but continued to be seen in male clothing on the streets of Stockholm until the 1740s, where she was known as \\"The Rider\\".Wilhelmina St√•lberg (Swedish): Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (Notes about Swedish women) (1864) There was a certain awareness about the phenomena among the public: in 1715, during a trial against male homosexuality, the soldier J√ºrgen Wiess defended himself by claiming that the only reason why he had reacted willingly to the sexual advances of a male corporal was because he believed the corporal to be a woman in disguise, as it was known that there were several disguised women among the soldiers.  In Culture  Ulrika Eleonora St√•lhammar is the subject of the book Ulrica Eleonora Karl XII:s Amazon (Ulrica Eleonora, the Amazon of Charles XII) by Colibrine Sandstr√∂m., and in a play which was performed by Calmare Gycklare in 2005.

It was first aired on ABC on 28 September 1965. The episode was written by Philip Levene, directed by Roy Ward Baker, and produced by Brian Clemens. Plot On a beach a shifty man is attending to his lobster pots when a man emerges from the tide concealed in a water tight black covering; he walks up the beach, removes the covering, and says good morning to the man and walks off. After a bout of fencing at Mrs. Peel's flat, Steed and Mrs Peel leave on a train to visit Little Bazeley by the Sea, a village in Norfolk where agents have been reported to go missing. On the train they share a carriage with a portly gentleman, Jimmy Smallwood (played by Patrick Newell, who would later become a semi-regular Avengers cast member playing spymaster \\"Mother\\"), who is going to visit his brother the local blacksmith. On arrival Steed, Peel and Smallwood are shadowed by the shifty local man from the beach. At the local inn, the Inebriated Gremlin, they are served by landlord Piggy Warren, who introduces them to Mark Brandon, the school inspector, and Jill Manson, a teacher. Mrs Peel announces herself as a new teacher, assigned by the ministry to the local school. When Smallwood leaves to visit his brother the blacksmith, several strange men in boots with rifles depart through the inn and follow him. Meanwhile, Steed and Mrs Peel find their rooms in a shabby state, with the shutters nailed shut. Smallwood fails to find his brother, and heads for the church, followed by the shifty local. Later the shifty local is seen hunting Smallwood across the landscape with bloodhounds. This is heard back at the village and dismissed by Piggy as \\"badger hunting\\". The following morning Steed and Mrs Peel examine strange footprints leading out of the sea and up the beach, and find Smallwood dead and buried in the sand. Mrs Peel visits the school and finds it and the teachers very unusual. She discovers that the school has been unused for years and a large number of adult sized Wellington boots are stored there. She visits the local church where the vicar shows her the parish records, of which several decades are missing. Meanwhile, Steed investigates the old wartime airfield and finds it in a similarly derelict state. Steed discovers a mention of a pilot, killed in 1942, named Piggy Warren: the name used by the pub landlord. Both Mrs Peel and Steed learn that the village folk are impostors and are hiding something. They seek out Smallwood's brother and find the shifty looking local who owns the bloodhounds pretending to be the blacksmith. Earlier they had seen a photo of Smallwood's brother so they know that he too is an impostor. While Mrs Peel is investigating the school, an elderly man ‚Äì the real School inspector ‚Äì runs in, pursued by the phony school inspector and the shifty local, and says little but \\"below, below\\" before dying. Mrs Peel revisits the church and confronts the vicar, who suddenly pulls out a gun and reveals he is also an impostor. Mrs Peel is tied up in the blacksmith's until Steed arrives, overpowers the shifty local and frees her. In the school, Steed and Mrs Peel discover enough food to feed an army. Mrs Peel reveals a diagram on the back of the old blackboard of Britain and a submarine in the North Sea. Wondering where have all the people gone, they surmise that this is a gradual invasion by a foreign power: small groups have been dispatched from a submarine located in the North Sea, explaining the bootprints at the beach and adult sized Wellington boots at the school, replacing the locals one by one until only the invaders remain. Heeding the dying man's words, they head to the old airfield's underground bunkers. There they discover a small army of enemy agents and a big supply of explosives and some high tech equipment. Steed and Mrs Peel are eventually found by some of the impostors; a fight ensues before they overpower them and leave after sealing the invaders permanently underground. They depart the village on a motor scooter driven by Mrs Peel.

However, the producers decided that she was not right for the role and replaced her with Diana Rigg. The episode was re-shot sometime between 21 July and 30 July 1965 part way through the season. The village scenes were shot in Wighton, the shoreline scenes were shot at Holkham Gap, and the airfield scenes were shot at then disused RAF Sculthorpe (which had, for some time prior, been a USAF base), near Fakenham, in Norfolk. The sets were designed by Harry Pottle. The episode first aired on ABC on 28 September 1965. Reception The episode was well-received; most striking in the oppressive and poignant atmosphere created by the derelict school and airfield abandoned since the war and the sheer decadence of the village depicted in it. Piers D. Britton and Simon J. Barker have written \\"Inebriated Gremlin, the village inn where Steed and Mrs. Peel stay, are manifestly created for emotional impact: as an environment, the pub is palpably hostile and almost viscerally nauseating. The lounge bar is thoroughly dilapidated and heavily cobwebbed, with a transistor radio perched on an old sofa cushion in lieu of the jukebox. Steed's bedroom is an even more powerful study in insalubrity. Chipped enamel basin, tarnished metal bedstead, tattered curtains and towels, a lumpy, ill-made bed, and a flypaper choked with its victims all proclaim the fact that visitors are not welcome. Pottle manipulated the very space of the set so as to ensure that it is unsettling: the strongly inclined coving of the ceiling creates an oppressive atmosphere, which resonates with Steed's discovery that the windows are boarded up on the outside.\\" Britton and Barker believe that the underlying theme of the episode is a \\"near-the-bone expose of parochial insularity and xenophobia in rural Norfolk.\\" They believe that Clemens intentionally laced the episode with black humour and clich√©s of a stereotypical rustic village with \\"inhospitable hostelry\\" and the \\"starkly silhouetted gothic church\\".

The dosage and effects are reported to be similar to those of methaqualone, but shorter acting and slightly weaker. Typical reports use between 50 and 500 mg of etaqualone, depending on desired effects. Old pharmaceutical formulations of Ethinazone were 350 mg tablets. Etaqualone is thought to act in a similar way to barbiturates and benzodiazepines by increasing the sensitivity of GABAA receptors . Recreational effects include euphoria, relaxation, increased sociability and sexuality, reduction of short-term memory, and loss of coordination. Combination with other depressants has a potentiating effect and can cause overdose. Tolerance to benzodiazepines or alcohol will also reduce effects. Ethaqualone can be present as a free base, insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol and nonpolar solvents, or as a water-soluble hydrochloride salt which is about 85% as potent as the freebase by weight. The most common route of administration of etaqualone is oral, but snorting the salt or smoking the free base have also been reported.

Like all other targumim, TgLam renders the biblical book into Aramaic while incorporating rabbinic interpretations into the resultant text. TgLam probably originated in the early centuries of the Common Era as a result of Lamentations' use in the liturgical worship of Tisha b‚ÄôAv, the day commemorating the destruction of Jerusalem. Reference to the use of a targum of Lamentations during Tisha b'Av services appears in the seventh-century text Soferim (42b). The extant versions of TgLam incorporate rabbinic traditions and may date to as late as the eighth century CE. The earliest manuscript of TgLam is Codex Solger MS 1-7.2‚à´, dated 1291 CE. TgLam's Aramaic mixes elements of eastern and western dialects. There are two primary textual traditions, that of western texts and those of Yemenite provenance. Content The targumist faced two theological challenges: the historical reality that Jerusalem and the Lord's Temple had been destroyed not once, but twice (in 586 BCE by the Babylonians and in 70 CE by the Romans), and the text of the Book of Lamentations itself, which challenges God directly. TgLam renders the first four verses of the Hebrew text with an extensive description of the sins of God's people, from Adam and Eve's rebellion to the refusal of the People of Israel to observe the Day of Atonement. The amount of additional material quickly declines so that the book's last three chapters are largely rendered verbatim. Yet when additions are made, they speak either to the deservedness of Israel's punishment or calling Israel back to right worship of God. The targumist's concern to demonstrate Israel's sin and rebellion against God responds to the biblical author's challenge to God's justice in allowing the destruction of Jerusalem and the death and suffering of so many. The targumist addresses this concern by following rabbinic interpretation of the destruction of Jerusalem, systematically demonstrating God's justice in punishing Israel, and showing that repentance and obedience to Torah will enable Israel to be received by God ‚Äúperfected in the world to come.‚Äù Sources * Brady, Christian M.M. ‚ÄúTargum Lamentations‚Äô Reading of the Book of Lamentations‚Äù (1MB pdf), Doctoral Thesis, Oxford, 2000. * Brady, Christian M.M.

Home of the School of Mathematics from July 2007 The Department of Mathematics at the University of Manchester is one of the largest unified mathematics departments in the United Kingdom, with over 90 academic staff and an undergraduate intake of roughly 400 students per year (including students studying mathematics with a minor in another subject) and approximately 200 postgraduate students in total.Certainly the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge is larger. Exact figures for Cambridge are hard to come by as the faculty is divided into DPMMS and DAMTP (which includes some physicists). In the 2001 RAE Cambridge returned 60 applied mathematicians and 38 pure mathematicians as lecturers and professors. In any measure Cambridge is bigger. Oxfords 2001 RAE return lists 43 pure, 32 applied and also 12 statisticians making it slightly larger than and the size may have increased. Probably the next biggest after Manchester is Leeds with about 70 academic staff over pure, applied and statistics.League Tables of UK Mathematics Departments, gives more details of size. The School of Mathematics was formed in 2004 by the merger of the mathematics departments of University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) and the Victoria University of Manchester (VUM). In July 2007 the department moved from the Mathematics Tower into a purpose-designed building‚îÄthe first three floors of the Alan Turing Building‚îÄon Upper Brook Street. In a Faculty restructure in 2019 the School of Mathematics reverted to the Department of Mathematics. It is one of five Departments that make up the School of Natural Sciences, which together with the School of Engineering now constitutes the Faculty of Science and Engineering at Manchester. Organization The atrium of the Alan Turing Building The current head of the department is Oliver Jensen. The department is divided, mainly for the purposes of teaching administration, into three groups: Pure Mathematics , Applied Mathematics , and Probability and Statistics . The Manchester Institute for Mathematical Sciences (MIMS) is a unit of the department focusing on the organising of mathematical colloquia and conferences, and research visitors. MIMS is headed by Nick Higham, who is also Director of Research. Other high-profile mathematicians at Manchester include Martin Taylor and Jeff Paris. Since its formation, the department has made some influential appointments including the topologist Viktor Buchstaber and model theorist Alex Wilkie. Numerical analyst Jack Dongarra, one of the authors of LINPACK, was appointed in 2007 as Turing Fellow. In the autumn of 2007, Albert Shiryaev was appointed to a 20% chair. Shiryaev is known for his work on probability theory (he was a student of Andrey Kolmogorov) and for his work on financial mathematics. Research As might be expected from its size, the department has a wide range of research interests, including the traditionally pure areas of algebra, analysis, noncommutative geometry, ergodic theory, mathematical logic, number theory, geometry and topology; and the more applied dynamical system, fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, inverse problems, mathematical finance, wave propagation and scattering. The department also has a strong tradition in numerical analysis and well established groups in Probability theory, and Mathematical statistics. Manchester mathematicians have a long tradition of applying mathematics to industrial problems. Nowadays this involves not only the traditional applications in engineering and the physical sciences, but also in the life sciences and the financial sector. Some of the recent industrial partners include Qinetiq, Hewlett Packard, NAg, MathWorks, Comsol, Philips Labs, Thales Underwater Systems, Rapiscan Systems and Schlumberger. =Research Assessment Exercise (2008)= The department of Mathematics entered research into three units of assessment. In Pure Mathematics 20% of submissions from 27 FTE category A staff were rated 4* (World Class) and 40% 3* (Internationally Excellent). In Applied Mathematics 25% of submissions from 28.8 FTE category A staff were rated 4* and 35%, 3*. And in Statistics and Operational Research, 20% of submissions from 10.9 FTE category A staff were rated 4* and 35%, 3*. History At the time of merger the two departments that came together to form the school were of roughly equal sizes and academic strengths, and already had a substantial record of collaboration including shared research seminar programmes and fourth year undergraduate and MSc programmes. Many famous mathematicians have worked at the precursor departments to the department. In 1885 Horace Lamb, famous for his contribution to fluid dynamics accepted a chair at the VUM and under his leadership the department grew rapidly. Newman wrote: :'His lecture courses were numerous, and his books provide a record of his methods. Many of his students were engineers, and they found in him a sympathetic guide, one who understood their difficulties and shared their interest in applications of mathematics to mechanics.' In 1907 famous analyst and number theorist John Edensor Littlewood was appointed to the Richardson Lectureship which he held for three years. During 1912‚Äì1913 the pioneer of weather forecasting and numerical analysis Lewis Fry Richardson worked at Manchester College of Science and Technology (later to become UMIST). Number theorist Louis J. Mordell joined the College in 1920. During this time he discovered the result for which he is best known, namely the finite basis theorem (or Mordell‚ÄìWeil theorem), which proved a conjecture of Henri Poincar√©. Mordell then went on to become Fielden Reader in Pure Mathematics at VUM in 1922 and then held the Fielden Chair in 1923. Mordell built up the department, offering posts to a number of outstanding mathematicians who had been forced from posts on the continent of Europe. He brought in Reinhold Baer, G. Billing, Paul Erd≈ës, Chao Ko, Kurt Mahler, and Beniamino Segre. He also recruited J. A. Todd, Patrick du Val, Harold Davenport, L. C. Young, and invited distinguished visitors. Although Manchester was later to be known as the birthplace of the electronic computer, Douglas Hartree made an earlier contribution building a differential analyser in 1933. The machine was used for ballistics calculations as well calculating railway timetables. Mordell was succeeded by the famous topologist and cryptanalyst Max Newman in 1945 who, as head of department, transformed it into a centre of international renown.Walter Ledermann, Encounters of a Mathematician, 2009 Undergraduate numbers increased from eight per year to 40 and then 60. In 1948 Newman recruited Alan Turing as Reader in the department, and he worked there until his death in 1954, completing some of his profound work on the foundations of computer science including Computing Machinery and Intelligence. Newman retired in 1964. From 1949 to 1960 M. S. Bartlett held the first chair in mathematical statistics at VUM, he is known for his contribution to the analysis of data with spatial and temporal patterns, the theory of statistical inference and in multivariate analysis. At Manchester he developed an interest in epidemiology, building a strong group in mathematical statistics and strengthening the department. The VUM Mathematics Tower prior to its demolition Fluid dynamicist Sydney Goldstein held the Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics from 1945 to 1950, and was succeeded from 1950 to 1959 by James Lighthill, also a fluid dynamicist. In pure mathematics, Bernhard Neumann, an influential group theorist, joined the department at VUM in 1948, leaving as a Reader in 1961 to take a chair in Australia. In 1969, VUM's Mathematics Tower, an 18-storey skyscraper on Oxford Road, was completed. Frank Bowman was the longest serving head of Mathematics at UMIST: 1933‚Äì1957. This portrait was presented to the department by the Royal Society of Chemistry Up until the 1950s, UMIST's Mathematics Department taught largely service courses for the engineering and applied science courses, and despite stars such as Richardson, Mordell and in 1958‚Äì1963 group theorist Hanna Neumann, did not have a strong focus on research. Neumann was later to be the first woman appointed to a Professorial Chair of Mathematics in Australia. The Maths and Social Sciences Building, which housed the UMIST Department of Mathematics from 1968 until merger, and part of the merged department until the opening of the Alan Turing Building in July 2007 With the rapid expansion of higher education and the starting of an undergraduate mathematics degree this changed, and by 1968 the 15-storey Maths and Social Sciences Building (MSS) was completed on UMIST campus to house the growing department. In 1960 Robin Bullough joined the UMIST department initiating four decades of mathematical physics focusing especially on solitons. The statistics group also grew in strength with an emphasis on time series, led by Maurice Priestley and also Tata Subba Rao. In 1986 pure mathematics at UMIST was strengthened by the appointment of Martin J. Taylor FRS, famous for his work on properties and structures of algebraic numbers. Another renowned topologist, Frank Adams, succeeded Newman in the Fielden Chair, which he held from 1964 to 1970. The VUM Mathematics tower was demolished in 2005, with most of the staff moving to temporary buildings, the pure mathematicians to one named after Newman and the applied to one named after Lamb. The history of the department entered a new phase in July 2007 with the move to the Alan Turing Building. The department was known as the School of Mathematics until a 2019 faculty-wide restructuring. In 2013, the Sir Horace Lamb Chair was founded in memory of Sir Horace Lamb. The chair was inaugurated in May 2013 with the appointment of Professor Oliver Jensen, who already held a personal chair in the school.

Roos enlisted in the army in 1713. She served until the end of the war, during which she was noted for her courage and promoted to the rank of non-commissioned officer for bravery in battle.Borgstr√∂m Eva, ed (2002). Makal√∂sa kvinnor: k√∂ns√∂verskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous Women: genderbenders in myth and reality) Stockholm: Alfabeta/Anamma. Libris 8707902. (inb.)(Swedish) She is reported to have served in the regiment of General Field Marshall Count Carl Gustaf D√ºcker (1663-1732). Apparently, she was never discovered. She is said to have been so \\"masculine\\" in her ways that no-one suspected her of being a woman, and she was also as tall as a man.Alf √Öberg (Swedish): Karolinska Kvinno√∂den (English: Fates of Carolinian Women) , in Swedish, page 160 Roos left the army in 1721 after the Treaty of Nystad in which Sweden formally ceded Ingria to Russia. After the war, she was employed for three years as head butler at the household of Countess D√ºcker, Hedvig Vilhelmina Oxenstierna (1682‚Äì1758). During an illness, however, a maid discovered her to be a woman and informed the countess. The countess agreed to keep quiet, but arranged a marriage for her with an officer. The officer was John Gustave Irving (1683-1744) himself a veteran of the Great Northern War. The marriage took place in 1724 and lasted for twenty years, during which she had at least two children. After the death of her spouse, she moved to K√∂ping in V√§stmanland. Her daughter Margareta Charlotta Irving (1728-1765), married Nils Larsson Sundell (1692-1757), vicar at Bro parish in V√§stmanland. Roos spent much of her later years with her daughter and son-in-law. During her old age, she was said to have given numerous proofs of a \\"male and courageous mind\\". The description of her service in the army was given by her family to a priest in 1843, 71 years after her death. Margareta Elisabeth Roos' service in the army is regarded as unconfirmed, as it was recounted only after her own death. In contrast to other women serving in the army posing as men, including Ulrika Eleonora St√•lhammar and Lisbetha Olsdotter, Margareta Elisabeth Roos was never discovered and brought to trial, and she is therefore not mentioned in any court documents, nor is the name which she used as a soldier known, which makes it hard to verify in military documents. However, the story about her is well known and is regarded to indicate a certain tolerance and admiration for women serving as soldiers, at least within aristocratic circles, despite the fact that it was regarded as a serious crime for a woman to pose as a man by contemporary law. The fact that she married a man after service is also taken as an indicator that posing as a soldier did not lower the repute as a marriage candidate.

Lawrence J. Crabb, Jr. is a Christian counselor, author, Bible teacher and seminar speaker. Crabb has written best- selling books and is the founder and director of NewWay Ministries and co- founder of his legacy ministry, Larger Story. He served as a Spiritual Director for the American Association of Christian Counselors and since 1996 has been the Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence of Colorado Christian University. Biography Crabb was born in Evanston, Illinois, United States, in 1944 and was a student of psychology until he began studying abnormal psychology and personality theory. During graduate school he experienced a period of deep scepticism before being guided back to the faith by Francis Schaeffer and CS Lewis. His renewed spiritual passion convinced him that Christianity had a role to play in clinical psychology. Crabb's first books were Basic Principles of Biblical Counseling (Zondervan, 1975) and Effective Biblical Counseling (Zondervan, 1977). He has gone on to write over 40 books; some of his more well-known ones include Inside Out, Finding God, Connecting and Men & Women: Enjoying the Difference. He founded the Institute of Biblical Counseling in the early-1980s while on the faculty of Grace Theological Seminary (1982‚Äì1989). The institute has since been replaced with the School of Behavioral Sciences. The school was birthed out of his book Shattered Dreams (WaterBrook, 2001) describing Naomi's journey from the Book of Ruth. New Way Ministries (the \\"new way\\" from Romans 7:6), established in 2001, runs the schools/conferences. Crabb was Adjunct Professor of Applied Theology at Regent College from 1998‚Äì1999, Chairman and Professor, Master of Arts in Biblical Counseling Program, Colorado Christian University, 1989‚Äì1996, Chairman and Professor, Graduate Department of Biblical Counseling, Grace Theological Seminary, 1982‚Äì1989 and in private practice for Clinical Psychology in Boca Raton, Florida, 1973-1982. He was also the lone psychologist at the Psychological Counseling Center, Florida Atlantic University \\\\- Assistant Professor, Psychology Department 1971-1973 and Assistant Professor, Psychology, University of Illinois Staff Psychologist, Student Counseling Center, University of Illinois, 1970-1971. He received Teacher of the Year Award in the Psychology Department in 1971. Crabb and his wife Rachael live in the Charlotte, North Carolina area. They have two sons, Kep & Ken, who are both married.  Biblical counseling  The book Basic Principles of Biblical Counseling (1975), gives Crabb's views of the shortcomings of five varieties of \\"secular\\" counseling, suggests the causes and structure of mental problems, and gives a Bible-centered approach to counseling. In the chapter Floating Anchors, Crabb describes the views of Sigmund Freud, \\"Ego Psychology\\", Carl Rogers, B.F. Skinner, and \\"Existentialism\\" (Victor Frankl) on the causes and structure of mental problems, and he finds each wanting. Each offers insights, but none reflects the Christian view that man is created in the image of God, yet fallen in sin. In the chapter An Aerial View, Crabb previews his theory: \\"negative (sinful) feelings\\" are the result of \\"negative (sinful) behavior\\" which is in turn the result of \\"wrong (sinful) thinking.\\" Repentance is a turn to \\"right thinking\\", which necessarily brings \\"right behavior\\" and \\"satisfying feelings\\". In the two chapters Understanding Our Deepest Needs, Crabb identifies our \\"deepest personal needs\\" as \\"significance\\" and \\"security\\". In the chapter Where Problems Start, Crabb argues that \\". . . resentment, guilt and anxiety seem to be the three central underlying disorders in all personal problems and they exist because we think incorrect thoughts\\". In the chapter Weaving Tangled Webs, Crabb presents case studies to \\"see how a counselor, armed with these fundamental ideas, can understand the confusing array of problems confronting him in his office\\". In the chapter Hold Your Client Responsible: For What?, Crabb emphasizes the client's need to take personal responsibility for changing his thoughts not just cognitively, but existentially, \\"dying to the sinful pattern of thinking\\".Dr. Larry Crabb at his desk in his home office. In the chapter The Mood And Goal of Counseling, Crabb argues that secular psychologists cannot give suffering evangelicals the help they need, because \\"[t]he goal of the biblical counselor is to assist a person to change in the direction of Christlikeness\\". Throughout the book, Crabb makes clear that he rejects the concept of mental illness. Mental disorders are the result of a sinful attitude toward God, and can only be healed through confession, remorse, and repentance. He discusses the problems of divorce and homosexuality as sinful actions, while emphasizing that any thought or behavior that separates a person from God is a sin. The husband must be head of the household, the wife must submit to him. This submission, however, entails the Christ-like submission that Jesus showed to the Father by coming to Earth in human form.

This gave a more even torque than with a 2-cylinder locomotive and reduced the risk of wheelslip under heavy load. All four passed into London and North Eastern Railway ownership at the 1923 grouping. At the time all four locomotives were allocated to Mexborough engine shed. These were powerful locomotives but even more power was required so, in 1930, one locomotive was fitted with a superheater and a booster engine and classified S1/2. Two new locomotives (with superheaters and boosters) were built by the LNER in 1932 and classified S1/3. The remaining (non-booster) locomotives were classified S1/1 and were also fitted with superheaters. All the boosters were removed in 1943.

It was introduced at the Tokyo Toy Show in 2006 by KK Eishindo of Japan, and went on sale in 2007. It is the smallest commercial model train scale in the world. Since mid-2009, Railway Shop (Hong Kong) is the exclusive licensed manufacturer. N, Z and T gauges Steam locomotive at T gauge T gauge steam loco on a 1 euro coin The models are powered with a battery-powered throttle (with optional AC adapter) at a maximum output of 4.5 V DC. To improve power pickup and tractive effort, the powered cars are fitted with magnetic wheels, and the track has steel rails. The first train released is the Japanese 103 series commuter train in different versions. Each standard trainset comes with two powered cars, which are located in the centre of the train. The front and rear cars are equipped with directional headlights. The tiny pantographs are made of etched stainless steel. The Hankyu Railway 9000 EMU Series and the Kiha 40 DMU were added to the line of available trainsets in early 2010, and feature improved mechanisms for better performance. Track is offered as flexible sections of rail and sleepers at , and as rigid sections with roadbed, and a small selection of pieces without roadbed. Rigid curved track is available with four different radii: , in 15¬∞ and 30¬∞ arc lengths; straight tracks are long. Points (switches or turnouts) are available in a single length right and left hand with manual or electric throw. Crossovers are made in 30¬∞ and 90¬∞ in 60mm length. Several miscellaneous track sections are also sold including power, isolating, and level grade crossing. The standard sectional track is \\"roadbed\\" style, with integrated ballast, or without roadbed as ‚Äúfine scale‚Äù. ‚ÄúFine scale‚Äù track is available in Track without roadbed is available as curved sections of 90¬∞ arc length; straight tracks are long. The rail is approximately high (\\"Code 40\\"). Track pieces are connected with gold-plated metal rail joiners plus plastic clips in the roadbed. Different types of dummy catenary masts can be attached to the track. The trains are powered by three 1.5 V AA batteries, an optional AC adaptor, or a USB plug. The direction of the train is changed by pressing a button. The control system includes two infrared sensors that can be clipped to the track. These sensors are used to automatically change the direction of the train if it is being operated on a linear (or point-to-point) track configuration, as opposed to a continuous loop. The throttle allows for either instant reversing, or reversing after a delay of approximately 5 seconds. The basic track set includes an oval of track, controller, electrical feeder, two sensors, rerailer, and a wheel cleaning device for the powered trains. The AC adaptor is available separately; plug versions for continental Europe, Britain and the US are available. In addition to the trains and track, available accessories include a large variety of scenic items: houses and apartment buildings, figures and animals, trees, bikes, boats and more. The houses are assembled and pre-painted, with fully detailed interiors that the modeller can install. The plastic figures, etched metal bikes, and other small items have small pins to make installation on a layout easier; the modeller simply makes a hole and inserts the detail into the hole using a toolkit available from Eishindo. Road signs, traffic lights and other street furniture is available, as well as a street decoration decal sheet, which comes with a scale ruler to aid the placement of markings and details. One unusual side-effect of the magnetic wheels of the powered units is that they can climb acute grades (as steep as 45 degrees). T scale trains may be used with model aeroplanes and model airports in the 1:400/1:500 scale range. Eishindo has been planning to produce a modest line of aeroplanes and accessories of their own.

Its existence dates back to the struggle for independence. In 2016 it was dissolved by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and replaced by the Direction des services de s√©curit√©. History=Formation, MALG= Members of the National Communications department (DTN) of MALG The DRS was formed as the Minist√®re de l'Armement et des Liaisons g√©n√©rales (MALG) during the Algerian War for independence, under the direction by Abdelhafid Boussouf, whose role was to lead both the national and international networks of the Front de lib√©ration nationale (FLN). After independence in 1962, and particularly with the accession of Houari Boum√©di√®ne to the leadership of the country in 1965, the Algerian intelligence services greatly professionalised and institutionalised. MALG was organized under five departments : # DTN: National Communications department # DDR: Documentation and Research department, responsible for military research # DVCR: Vigilance and Counter Intelligence # DLG: Army post network # Management of logistics for acquiring, storing, and routing weapons and equipment. =S√©curit√© Militaire= This change of internal organization was modeled to a large extent on the intelligence and internal security services of the then Eastern bloc Nations. Renamed S√©curit√© Militaire (SM) its directives were: * Counter- espionage * Internal security * Foreign intelligence The first appointed Chairman of Military Security was the colonel Kasdi Merbah who stayed until the death of president Boum√©di√®ne in 1978. Then he was succeeded for a short time by colonel Yazid Zerhouni. President Chadli Bendjedid, who mistrusted the SM, dismantled it and renamed it the DGPS. Chadli appointed to the chair of the DGPS general Lakehal Ayat, reorganising the agency to work solely in foreign intelligence. =DRS= The riots and turmoil of October 1988 caused president Chadli Bendjedid to dismiss General Ayat, who was succeeded by General Betchine. His tenure saw major political change, beginning with the advent of a multi-party political system and the rise of the Islamist movement of the FIS. Betchine was then replaced by Mohamed Medi√®ne in November 1990, who served until 2015. Following this, the Services changed its name once again, from DGPS to DRS. Outside observers have charged that Medi√®ne was one of the junta of generals who forced the cancellation the 1991 elections which the Islamists were set to win, plunging the nation into a war against the Islamist, and greatly increasing the power of the military‚Äîand the DRS‚Äîin Algeria's government.Omar Ashour.

Biography Van Bommel was born in Leiden to a well-established commercial family. His mother was a French immigrant. Orphaned by the age of 13, he was educated at the college of Willingshegge near M√ºnster, and later at the advanced school of Borght. Against strong opposition he entered the seminary of M√ºnster and was ordained priest in 1816 by Bishop Kaspar Droste zu Vischering. After ordination he returned to the Low Countries, where the United Kingdom of the Netherlands had recently been founded. There he founded a college for young men at Hageveld, near Haarlem. The college was closed in 1825 in consequence of the royal decree that subjected all educational institutions to State control. King William I of the Netherlands offered van Bommel the presidency of another college, but met with a firm refusal. The Catholics and Liberals joined forces in opposing the arbitrary policy of the Government, and van Bommel took a prominent part in the agitation that forced the king to promulgate the Concordat concluded with Pope Leo XII. Under the provisions of the Concordat, van Bommel was nominated to the See of Li√®ge, which had been vacant for over 20 years. He was consecrated on 15 November 1829. He took no active part in the revolution of 1830, but as Bishop of Li√®ge he was forced to sever his connection with the Netherlands. He organized Li√®ge seminary, revived Catholic elementary education, and it was upon his initiative that the Belgian bishops decided to found the Catholic University of Leuven.J.J. De Smet, \\"Bommel (Corneille-Richard-Antoine Van)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 2 (Brussels, 1868), 667-671. Bishop van Bommel was a defender of the primacy of the Holy See, an opponent of Freemasonry, and an advocate of religious education. At the reorganization of public instruction in 1842, his educational views were put in force in those gymnasia and technical schools which the State maintained wholly or in part. His writings comprise three volumes of Pastoral Letters, and a number of pamphlets on ecclesiastical and educational questions. He died in Li√®ge on 7 April 1852.

Biography Itzchak Tarkay was born in Subotica, on the Yugoslav-Hungarian border. At the age of 9, Tarkay and his family were sent to the Mauthausen concentration camp by the Nazis until Allied liberation freed them a year later. In 1949, his family immigrated to Israel and was sent to the transit camp for new arrivals at Beer Yaakov. They lived in a kibbutz for several years. In 1951 Tarkay received a scholarship to the Avni Art Academy where he studied under the artist Schwartzman and was mentored by important Israeli artists of the time such as Mokady, Janko, Streichman and Stematsky. Tarkay's wife is Bruria Tarkay. They have two sons, Adi and Itay Tarkay. Tarkay died in 2012 at the age of 77.  Art career  As well as being an acrylic painter and watercolorist, Tarkay was a graphic artist and his rich tapestry of form and color was achieved primarily through the use of the serigraph. In his serigraphs, many colors are laid over one another and used to create texture and transparency. In his later years, Tarkay mentored younger Israeli artists including David Najar, Yuval Wolfson and Mark Kanovich who often visited his studio, worked alongside him and received his critiques. Tarkay was also the only artist to collaborate with Israeli master, Yaacov Agam (1928). He and Agam created two paintings which incorporated both artists‚Äô imagery in a single painting. https://rogallery.com/Tarkay_Itzchak/tarkay_bio.htm Tarkay's art is influenced by French Impressionism, and Post-Impressionism, particularly Matisse and Toulouse-Lautrec. His work was exhibited at the International Art Expo in New York City in 1986 and 1987. He has been the subject of three books, published by Dr. Israel Perry. Perry Art Gallery And Park West Gallery, his dealer. His art is focused on almost dream images of elegant women in classical scenes. Tarkay's early works were done by him personally to completion, but his later works were drawn by him and then colored in by helping artists on staff. Today, the most important works by Tarkay are those that were done by his hand without assistance from others.

History MV Isle of Mull was designed for the route between Oban and Craignure on the Isle of Mull. After being launched on the Clyde in 1987, she entered service on 11 April 1988, in place of the older and slower . However the new vessel was seriously overweight ‚Äì by more than 100 tons - due to both design and Steel Supply, British Steel had installed a new Computerised Gauge Control at its Dalzell Plate production unit, and during the initial production of steel plate after its introduction it tended to produce plates still within the allowed manufacturing specification, but at or near the upper gauge allowed in the tolerance - resulting in the steel tending to be heavier than designed. In late autumn 1988 she was taken out of service for two weeks and sent to Tees Dockyard Ltd in Middlesbrough to be lengthened by 5.4 m (20 ft). The extent of this implant can most easily be observed when climbing the stairs from the car deck to the passenger accommodation. These stairs used to be a single flight, but now have a level section halfway up. The new length of hull made the vessel better both in terms of vehicle capacity (taking it to around 80) but also in that she handled better at sea with her overall speed increased slightly. In the late 1990s she underwent internal refurbishment. Her cafeteria was redecorated and the serving area modified ‚Äì setting the standard for the rest of the fleet. The shop was moved to a more prominent position in the entrance concourse and she received new seating covers etc. The Isle of Mull underwent another major refurbishment in 2005. The cafeteria was redesigned with a new service area layout, including self-service tea and coffee machines and was renamed the Mariners Cafeteria. A coffee bar was installed in the viewing lounge at the after end of the ship opposite the doors leading out to the open deck which overlooks the rope handling area of the ship and is named the Coffee Cabin. The bar has also been renamed The Still. Layout The totally enclosed car deck has room for up to 70 cars. Headroom on the bow and stern ramps is 4.7 metres. She is equipped with a bow visor, bow ramp and stern ramp. The two-part folding bow ramp is shaped like an inverted ‚ÄòL‚Äô. When raised, the main section plugs the access to the car deck. The forward section folds out flat upon contact with the linkspan. Above the car deck are two levels of accommodation, providing shelter and facilities for up to 1000 passengers. The first deck houses the cafeteria at the bow, with the main entrance concourse and shop immediately aft. Behind this are lounges, toilets and the information desk, with the bar at the stern. The next deck has an observation lounge at the stern and crew accommodation further forward. External deck space stretches from the lounge to just short of the bridge on both sides. An observation lounge on the top deck has seating aft of the funnel. The large amount of open deck space is one factor that makes the Isle of Mull popular with tourists. Service MV Isle of Mull has operated the crossing between Oban and Craignure on the Isle of Mull since 1988. She completes the sailing in 45 minutes on a good day, although the short turnaround and poor manoeuvrability in even light winds lead to frequent delays and increasing cancellations. There is some flexibility with additional sailings provided by . Isle of Mull also provides the winter link between the mainland and the island of Colonsay and has provided winter relief on a various routes, such as between Ullapool and Stornoway from 1989 to 1998, covering for overhauls of MV Suilven & MV Isle of Lewis and between Ardrossan and Brodick in 2007. In October 1989, her larger passenger capacity was required at Stornoway for those travelling to the Mod. This meant she basically swapped places with the Suilven, which took over the Oban-Craignure service for 10 days.

In mathematics, given a vector at a point on a curve, that vector can be decomposed uniquely as a sum of two vectors, one tangent to the curve, called the tangential component of the vector, and another one perpendicular to the curve, called the normal component of the vector. Similarly a vector at a point on a surface can be broken down the same way. More generally, given a submanifold N of a manifold M, and a vector in the tangent space to M at a point of N, it can be decomposed into the component tangent to N and the component normal to N. Formal definition=Surface= More formally, let S be a surface, and x be a point on the surface. Let \\\\mathbf{v} be a vector at x. Then one can write uniquely \\\\mathbf{v} as a sum : \\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\parallel + \\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\perp where the first vector in the sum is the tangential component and the second one is the normal component. It follows immediately that these two vectors are perpendicular to each other. To calculate the tangential and normal components, consider a unit normal to the surface, that is, a unit vector \\\\hat{n} perpendicular to S at x. Then, :\\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\perp = (\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot\\\\hat{n})\\\\hat{n} and thus :\\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\parallel = \\\\mathbf{v} - \\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\perp where \\"\\\\cdot\\" denotes the dot product. Another formula for the tangential component is :\\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\parallel = -\\\\hat{n}\\\\times(\\\\hat{n}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{v}), where \\"\\\\times\\" denotes the cross product. Note that these formulas do not depend on the particular unit normal \\\\hat{n} used (there exist two unit normals to any surface at a given point, pointing in opposite directions, so one of the unit normals is the negative of the other one). =Submanifold= More generally, given a submanifold N of a manifold M and a point p \\\\in N, we get a short exact sequence involving the tangent spaces: :T_p N \\\\to T_p M \\\\to T_p M / T_p N The Quotianifold, the above sequence splits, and the tangent space of M at p decomposes as a direct sum of the component tangent to N and the component normal to N: :T_p M = T_p N \\\\oplus N_p N := (T_p N)^\\\\perp Thus every tangent vector v \\\\in T_p M splits as v = v_\\\\parallel + v_\\\\perp, where v_\\\\parallel \\\\in T_p N and v_\\\\perp \\\\in N_p N := (T_p N)^\\\\perp. Computations Suppose N is given by non-degenerate equations. If N is given explicitly, via parametric equations (such as a parametric curve), then the derivative gives a spanning set for the tangent bundle (it's a basis if and only if the parametrization is an immersion). If N is given implicitly (as in the above description of a surface, or more generally as a hypersurface) as a level set or intersection of level surfaces for g_i, then the gradients of g_i span the normal space. In both cases, we can again compute using the dot product; the cross product is special to 3 dimensions though.

Leonard and starring Claudette Colbert, Walter Pidgeon and June Allyson. Plot Lee (Claudette Colbert) is engaged to marry Larry Adams (Richard Derr), a spendthrift widower with two children, son Chase (Robert Sterling) and daughter Penny (June Allyson). Lee had been living in England with her guardian aunt, who didn't approve of the match since Larry was an alcoholic, and while returning to America on an ocean liner, she meets Chris Matthews (Walter Pidgeon), a close friend of Larry's. Despite her loving feelings for Chris, she marries Larry, and moves to his farm in Rhode Island. Larry's talent is playing the piano, which he teaches Penny, but he gave up this ambition to work in a bank, to please his father. This frustrated ambition has ruined his life, and over the next two years Lee tries to confront his alcoholism, while trying to win Penny's confidence. While Lee is out for the night with Chris, Larry dies, his body found at the bottom of a cliff. He had committed suicide after two years of marriage, and on his death, it is reported that Larry had embezzled money from his clients. Lee sends Chris away and moves the family away from the farm, to New York where she takes a job to pay off Larry's debts, and withholds the truth from Penny, wanting to shield her from the stigma of scandal. Penny makes a hero out of Larry, who she believes died of a heart attack, and is unable to embrace Lee, who is now left to look after them alone. Ten years later, Penny, who behaves strangely, has dropped out of school and plays the piano incessantly for her father's memory when nobody else is around, is the patient of psychiatrist Dr. Rossiger. Lee goes to see him, concerned about Penny's behaviour, and the story up to this point is recalled in flashback. The doctor advises that they move back to the farm for the summer, since that is where the death occurred, and he believes that confronting the past will help cure Penny. Chase returns from the navy after three years and seeks a job with Chris, who now owns a shipyard. He introduces Penny to his navy friend Brandon Reynolds. They all move to the farm, together with Chase's friend Kay Burns, where Chris reenters Lee's life after a ten- year absence, and Lee realizes that it was Chris she loved all along and let get away. Once at the farm, Penny becomes disenchanted with her father's memory when Chase tells her the truth, and becomes despondent, feeling that Chris is the only person she can confide in. Although Brandon is interested in Penny, she loves Chris, and is devastated when she finds him in Lee's arms. Penny then tries to kill herself by jumping off a cliff, as Larry had done, but Lee intervenes in time to prevent it. The healing process begins and when Lee tells Penny the complete story of her father's life, Penny is finally able to embrace Lee.

It has been approved by the Department for Children, Schools and Families under Section 347(1) of the Education Act 1996. There are around 100 staff members working in the school. The Executive Principal of both North Hill House is Sarah Acland History Prior to its current state, North Hill House's original building had become Farleigh sixth form further education college. The specialist school's current building was originally an open-plan office, owned by another company. In 2002, the building was bought by The Priory Healthcare Group and was changed into a school. The new North Hill house was opened by late 2003. During 2009, the school buildings were enlarged by incorporating a listed building, Stoneleigh House, on the same site. Campus The School is situated a few hundred metres from the centre of the Frome. The school moved to a new, purpose-built site ‚Äì only a few yards away ‚Äì in September 2003. The old building is now Farleigh sixth form further education college, also owned by The Priory Healthcare Group. =Expansion= The school has recently expanded into Stoneleigh House, a Grade II listed building built in the early 19th century, where the offices were situated. In September 2008, Stonleigh was renovated and many of the rooms were converted into classrooms. The main offices still remain on the first floor however. Facilities In addition to classrooms, North Hill House contains an Occupational Therapy room, in which students with problems such as developmental co-ordination disorder can be given specialist help, from a qualified member of staff. For use with all pupils, the specialist school contains two 'time out' rooms, in which students can reside if they feel stressed. The first is a 'soft' room, which is covered in blue foam, (The Blue Room), and the second is a room with a sofa for students to discuss any problems they may have. =Subjects= North Hill House covers many subjects for GCSE. In addition to the standard subjects, the specialist school can give other specialist lessons including the following: *DiDA (ICT) *Literacy *Numeracy *Speech and Language Therapy (SALT) *Occupational Therapy (OT) Mission statement Mission Statement 'The fostering of a responsible, positive outlook on life and achievement through the provision of an appropriate and stimulating educational environment.' Purpose ‚Äì North Hill House aims: * To develop and enhance abilities, giving appropriate guidance with realistic expectations. * To plan flexible and varied individual education programmes promoting academic and life skills in a supportive learning community. * To manage behaviour consistently, clearly defining rules and boundaries and using rewards and sanctions to demonstrate the consequences of actions. * To help students develop strategies to cope with conflict, anger, stress and anxiety. * To motivate students to assert themselves in a positive way while respecting the rights and sensibilities of others. * To encourage interaction with others, promoting participation and teamwork and building self-esteem and self-reliance through a broad range of approaches. * To promote awareness of self and others by developing relationship-building and communication skills; thus helping students to recognise and share feelings, and by offering spiritual and moral guidance. * To demonstrate the importance of acceptable and appropriate behaviour, including equal opportunities issues. * To build and develop a partnership between home and school, which is reflective of the school's team approach. * To develop positive links with the local community.

Plot Alison Courtland, a wealthy New Yorker, hasn't a clue how she ended up on a train bound for Boston. When she phones her husband, Richard, the police listen in and learn from Richard that his wife has threatened him with a gun. On a flight home, fellow passenger Bruce Elcott falls in love with the married but unhappy Alison. Her husband makes Alison begin seeing Dr. Rhinehart, a psychiatrist. But it turns out that Rhinehart is a fake. He is actually Charles Vernay, a photographer hired by Richard Courtland, who is having an affair with another woman, Daphne, and hopes to get rid of Alison for good. The scheme is to drive Alison to suicide and inherit her money. Elcott arrives just in time to find Alison, apparently under hypnosis, about to leap from a balcony to her death. Elcott discovers that Vernay is the man who pretended to be the doctor. Richard, meanwhile, attempts to drug Alison and make her kill the doctor herself. Vernay finds out he has been betrayed. Verney then shoots Richard and is later killed by falling through a skylight after being chased by Elcott. It appears Elcott and Alison live happily ever after.

From this perspective, globalization, the shift from the manufacturing sector to the service sector, and the spread of information technology have created a new economy which demands flexibility in the workplace, resulting in the decline of the standard employment relationship, particularly for women. The characterization of temporary work as \\"precarious\\" is disputed by some scholars and entrepreneurs who see these changes as positive for individual workers. Contrast with regular and temporary employment The term \\"precarious work\\" is frequently associated with the following types of employment: \\"part-time employment, self- employment, fixed-term work, temporary work, on-call work, home-based workers, and telecommuting.\\" Scholars and critics who use the term \\"precarious work\\" contrast it with the \\"standard employment relationship\\", which is the term they use to describe full-time, continuous employment where the employee works on their employer's premises or under the employer's supervision, under an employment contract of indefinite duration, with standardized working hours/weeks and social benefits such as pensions, unemployment benefits, and medical coverage. This \\"standard employment relationship\\" emerged after World War II, as men who completed their education would go on to work full-time for one employer their entire lives until their retirement at the age of 65. It did not typically describe women in the same time period, who would only work temporarily until they got married and had children, at which time they would withdraw from the workforce. \\"We Can Do It!\\" US wartime poster While many different kinds of part-time or limited-term jobs can be temporary, critics use the term \\"precarious\\" strictly to describe work that is uncertain, unpredictable, or offers little to no control over working hours or conditions. This characterization has been challenged by scholars focused on the agency that temporary work affords individual workers. However, many studies promoting individual agency focus on highly educated and skilled knowledge workers, rather than all kinds of temporary workers. Regulation While increased flexibility in the marketplace and in employment relationships has created new opportunities for regulation, regulation intended explicitly to remediate precarious work often produces mixed results.. The International Labour Organization (ILO) has developed standards for atypical and precarious employment, including the 1994 Convention Concerning Part-time Work, the 1996 Convention Concerning Home Work, and the 1999 \\"Decent Work\\" initiative.

The land in the area consists of dunes with fens, grassland, reedbeds, purple moor grass, rush pastures, and maritime cliffs, and is inhabited by wildlife such as waders, chough, over-wintering northern lapwing, and grey seal. Despite its natural beauty, Freshwater West is unsuitable for bathing due to strong offshore swells and strong currents. There is an abundance of fossils in the area, and in 1921 some 50 were reported to have been discovered here. Landmarks and surfing Surfing at Freshwater West The beach is popular with tourists and locals throughout the year, especially between March and October. Facilities at the beach include toilets, emergency telephone and car parking. From Easter onwards, an ice-cream or hot-dog van is usually in the main car park. There is the Castlemartin MOD firing range in the area which can be alarming and pose a hazard within a radius during peak firing. Freshwater has a thatched seaweed-drying hut, and there is an Iron Age burial chamber immediately to the north known as the \\"Devil's Quoit\\" which is situated in the field left of the main road out of Freshwater. Freshwater West is one of the top surfing locations in Wales due to its consistent swell and strong waves. The beach regularly hosts surfing tournaments such as the Welsh National Surfing Championships with participants arriving from all over the world. Since 2010 it has had a lifeguard station which is active during the summer months.

History  The second largest community on the island, Fogo may also be the location of the island's first permanent settlement, which took place in the early 18th century, though it is unknown which exact area of Fogo Island hosted the first European settlers. Some historians feel Tilting Harbour might have been the first settlement, owing to its sheltered harbour and close proximity to fishing grounds, although some local legends say that an English settlement was in place at Fogo (town) as early as 1680, this is highly unlikely. James Cook surveyed the area in the 1770s, and at that time he was told that the first English settlers in the area were in Twillingate in the year 1728. Before that, French fishermen frequented the area, but never settled permanently. Fogo is situated on Fogo Harbour, along the island's north shore. Its economy is tied to the fishing industry and, from the 18th to 20th centuries, was home to several fish merchants.

During the Unified Silla period, Jang Bogo, a merchant, rose as an admiral and created the first maritime trading within East Asian countries. During the Goryeo dynasty, sturdy wooden ships were built and used to fight pirates. Korean shipbuilding again excelled during the Imjin war, when Admiral Yi defeated the advancing Japanese fleets. Today, South Korea is the world's largest shipbuilding nation and also the world's builder and exporter of ships. The South Korean Navy is concentrating its efforts to increasing its number, develop new ships, and become a blue-water navy by 2020.\\"ÎåÄÏñëÌï¥Íµ∞Í±¥ÏÑ§\\". _Republic of Korea Navy Official Website_. Retrieved March 4, 2007. Three Kingdoms of Korea period Ships were developed and used since the Three Kingdoms of Korea period. Because of the abundance of coastal waters surrounding the Korean peninsula, Koreans developed simple fishing ships to take advantage of the resources. Baekje, one of the kingdoms, first began expanding its navy and trading products by sea. Baekje also provided the link to spread Buddhism and Korean and Chinese culture to Japan. However, with the rise of Goguryeo's power and Gwanggeto the Great, Baekje's navy was soon defeated near the end of the 4th century Goguryeo also repelled numerous Chinese naval forces during its wars with China. During the Goguryeo-Sui Wars, Goguryeo defeated an invading Chinese fleet in 598, in the Bohai Sea. North-South States period After the defeat of Goguryeo with an alliance with Tang China in 668, Silla unified the Korean peninsula. During this time, Korean culture and philosophy reached its height, and Unified Silla maintained a large trading network with both China and Japan. Silla, like previous Korean kingdoms, maintained powerful control over its trade routes and oceanic territory as Japanese and Chinese pirates began to harass trade routes over sea. From 828 to 846, however, a Silla merchant named Jang Bogo, rose to prominence and gathered a navy to repel pirates and control Korean trade routes. Jang eventually became a maritime commissioner on Wando Island. With stable control over maritime rights, Silla prospered in the peace of its rule. However, internal strife weakened it and after wars during the Later Three Kingdoms period, fell the Goryeo in 935. Goryeo Dynasty period Korean shipbuilding again excelled during the Goryeo Dynasty. In the 11th century, Goryeo shipbuilders developed the kwason, or spear vessel.Turnbull, Stephen, Samurai Invasion, Sterling, p. 88 This ships was designed to ram and destroy Japanese pirate vessels, who were attacking coastal Korean cities. Goryeo ships were both large and strong in terms of size and durability and the largest could carry 200 or more fighting marines. Choe Mu-seon, a Goryeo scientist, developed Korean cannon in the 14th century. They were soon developed to be used on Goryeo battleships and were used with success against the Mongol invasion. During the Mongol invasion of Japan in 1281, about 900 Goryeo ships that assisted the invasion with Yuan Mongol vessels, only a few Goryeo ships were damaged while most of the invasion force of Mongol vessels were destroyed in the \\"kamikaze\\", or divine wind. By 1380 the Goryeo navy had implemented widespread use of cannons on board their ships attacked and a large wako fleet off of the Geum River which resulted in the near annihilation of almost the entire wako fleet. The world's first naval artillery battle took place off the coast of Korea. In the Battle of Chinpo (1380), 80 Koryo warships, equipped with firearms invented by Choi Mu-son, sank 500 Japanese wako, or pirate ships. Also in 1383, Admiral Jeong Ji destroyed 17 wako pirate vessels using shipboard cannons. In 1389 a total of 300 Waegu ships were destroyed and over a hundred of Korean prisoners liberated in a raid on Tsushima ordered by Yi Seonggye. Joseon Dynasty period Panokseons were sturdy and powerful battleships superior to the Japanese vessels during the Imjin war. A modern replica of the turtle ship. During the Joseon Dynasty, however, the navy and maritime operations fell into disuse, while fishing ships continued to operate and prosper. Because of the relative peace during the Joseon dynasty, the entire military itself weakened and was ignored. Also, with the policy of Korean kings that emphasized agriculture and Confucian ideals, the Korean navy along with the rest of the Korean military weakened steadily. However, in 1419, King Sejong sent Yi Jong- mu to destroy the Japanese on Tsushima Island in the Oei Invasion as a response to Japanese Wokou raids on Korean coastal cities. Yi took 227 Korean ships and about 17,000 soldiers landed and attacked Japanese settlements on Tsushima Island, destroying crops, killing Japanese islanders and pirates, and plundering ships. The So clan, the ruling seat of Japan, surrendered and requested to pay tributes. Korea allowed the So clan to be able to trade with Korean coastal harbors under the condition that Japanese pirates be suppressed. Korea eventually developed strong wooden ships called panokseons that made up the backbone of the Joseon navy. In the 15th century, under the decree of King Sejong, more powerful cannons were developed and tested. Used on battleships, the cannons proved to be a great success during actions against Japanese pirate ships. Panokseons and the Korean navy were most widely used during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598) when Admiral Yi Sun- sin's brilliant strategy defeated Japanese fleets. Admiral Yi also developed the turtle ship upon an older design.

It traces its origins back to 1793 when a lay school for boys was established in St.Patrick's College, Carlow in conjunction with the seminary there. In 1847 it was decided that the young pupils in the school should come out to Knockbeg, which had been a gentry estate on the banks of the River Barrow before being purchased by the Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin, in 1892 all lay students were moved to Knockbeg. The initial school had about 40 pupils but the numbers grew as all the lay pupils from St Patrick's transferred out. In 1898 the school became the official junior seminary for the diocese.

The village is part of the electoral ward of Thrushel. The population of the surrounding Thrushel ward (which includes the village of Thrushelton to the east of Lifton) at the 2011 census was 1680. History The village was one of the first in the west of Devon to be founded by the Saxons, and was of strategic importance because of its location on a major route close to the border with Cornwall. It was first recorded as Liwtune in the will of King Alfred in the late 9th century when it was left to his youngest son Aethelweard (c.880-922). At a meeting of the Witan in Lifton on 12 November 931 King √Üthelstan granted land to his thegn Wulfgar, and the charter was witnessed by King Hywel Dda of Deheubarth and King Idwal Foel of Gwynedd. Lifton became the centre of an administrative hundred, and was a royal manor, passing into private hands when sold by Queen Elizabeth I to local landowner William Harris of Hayne in the parish of Stowford, Devon, in the late 16th century. Since they had moved here from Kenegie in Cornwall their armorial bearings include a motto in Cornish, which is \\"Car Dew tres pub tra\\" (\\"Love God above everything\\").Quoted from the Cornish medieval play of the Passion, translated by Charles Henderson in: Henderson, Charles (1935) \\"Cornish inns\\", in: Essays in Cornish History; ed. by A. L. Rowse and M. I. Henderson. London: Oxford U. P.; pp. 168-71 A former inn at Portgate, the Harris Arms, named after the family, is now a private residence There has been a church in Lifton since Norman times, although little of the existing St Mary's Church is earlier than the 15th century.History of Lifton website In 1755 the manor was inherited by the Arundell family. The Arundell Arms is a hotel, formerly a coaching inn known as the \\"White Horse\\", which is known today for fishing. Agriculture and mining have supported the economy in the past. The dairy company, Ambrosia, has been based here since 1917. Started as a milk factory using supplies from dairy farms in the area, it produced dried milk during the Second World War. The site has been enlarged considerably and the firm is now an important local employer.Lifton Village Trail Lifton railway station on the South Devon and Tavistock Railway opened on 1 June 1865. The main building was on the platform used by trains towards Plymouth but there was a loop and second platform to allow trains to pass. There was a level crossing at the west end of the station. The goods yard was on the same side as the buildings but a private siding was opened in 1894 to serve a corn mill, and a factory was opened in the goods yard in 1917 that handled milk, and later made \\"Ambrosia\\" rice pudding. Passenger trains and public goods traffic ceased on 31 December 1962 but the line to Lydford was retained to carry the trains from the milk factory but this closed on 28 February 1966. The village was bypassed by the A30 in 1993, and today, unusually for such a small place, Lifton is a post town and has several youth football teams.It also has the 1st Lifton Sea Scouts.

It was originally known as White Blood. This was the name given to liquid rubber as it is tapped from trees. However the title was criticised by the Colonial Office and overseas distributors because it could be interpreted as referring to racial discrimination, so it was changed to The Planter's Wife. The film was co-financed by the NFFC and the Rank Organisation. The producer, John Stafford, was freelance. =Casting= To encourage a receptive American audience, Pinewood Studios head Earl St. John sent Annakin to Hollywood in November 1951 to select an American actress for the female lead. Annakin interviewed Norma Shearer, Loretta Young, Joan Crawford, Olivia de Havilland and Claudette Colbert.

They were simple locomotives and in UK service they were very reliable. \\"17in\\" refers to their cylinder diameter in inches. They were called \\"Coal Engines\\" because they were used for hauling coal trains. Design and Construction The 17in Coal was the first new design of engine to be built by Webb since he became Chief Engineer of the LNWR in September 1871. A policy of 'low costs' was in force at the LNWR, with running costs per engine mile reduced from d per engine mile in 1857 to d by 1871. The first 17in Coal was constructed in 1873, the first of almost five hundred built. Ernest L. Ahrons is quoted as regarding the type as \\"probably the simplest and cheapest locomotives ever made in this country\\", and O.S. Nock described them as \\"splendid\\". No. 1140 (works number 2153 was built from raw materials and in steam within hours in February 1878Many aspects of the 17in Coal's design reflected John Ramsbottom's final design: the 0-6-0 Special Tank, including the identical wheel diameter and cylinder dimensions, but the new engines had a larger, improved boiler. In February 1878, one engine of this design was built from scratch in hours. Operation During the First World War the Railway Operating Division of the Royal Engineers took many Coal Engines for use overseas, including many to the British Expeditionary Force in France and 42 to the Palestine Military Railway. Those in Palestine were reported to have performed badly and Palestine Railways sold them all for scrap by 1922. This may have been due partly to the poor quality of water used in Palestine. In the 1923 grouping 227 Coal Engines passed into LMS stock. 35 survived until the nationalisation of Britain's Railways in 1948 and entered British Railways stock.

It is based on a real-life incident surrounding a record-setting Barry Bonds home run, where the ball was contested in the property law case of Popov v. Hayashi. It was directed and produced by Michael Wranovics. Plot The ball happened to be the one hit by San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds for his record-setting 73rd home run at the end of the 2001 MLB season. When the ball landed in the right-field bleachers at what was then PacBell Park (San Francisco), there was a mad scramble for the precious ball, bodies piled up on the walkway above McCovey Cove. Patrick Hayashi, who stood quietly with a sheepish grin on his face as the scrum continued, eventually held the historic ball up for a TV camera to reveal that he had possession of it. MLB and Giants security grabbed Mr. Hayashi and escorted him down to the bowels of the ballpark and authenticated his baseball as the true #73. As Hayashi prepared to be the next Bay Area millionaire, a man named Alex Popov, owner of Smart Alec's restaurant in Berkeley, California, was complaining loudly that he had caught the ball on the fly and that Patrick had stolen the ball from him at the bottom of the pile. Video footage shot by KNTV news cameraman Josh Keppel did actually show the ball land in Popov's glove, providing the key evidence that led to a trial in San Francisco Superior Court. While the 88-minute film does tell the story from the moment the ball leaves Barry Bonds' bat all the way through the trial and to the dramatic auction where the ball was finally sold to the highest bidder, the film is more of a satire than a serious examination of what actually happened and who ultimately deserved the ball. Inspired by the mockumentary films of Christopher Guest (Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, etc.), Up for Grabs focuses on the characters involved rather than the event itself. Awards Up for Grabs won the Audience Award for Best Documentary at the 2004 Los Angeles Film Festival, plus Best Documentary at the Gen Art Film Festival (New York) and the Phoenix Film Festival. Its Rotten Tomatoes critical \\"Fresh\\" rating is 93%. MLB Advanced Media released the DVD during the 2007 MLB season - which coincides with Barry Bonds' successful pursuit of Hank Aaron's lifetime home run record. Bonds hit his 756th career HR on August 7, 2007. The film was nominated for the William Shatner Golden Groundhog Award for Best Underground Movie, other nominated films were Lexi Alexander's Green Street Hooligans, Neil Gaiman's and Dave McKean's MirrorMask, Rodrigo Garc√≠a's Nine Lives, and Opie Gets Laid.

He attended Statesboro High School in Georgia. Following high school, Hamilton attended Georgia Southern University for three years. He started his professional career in 1991 when he was drafted by the San Diego Padres, and pitched for three major league teams during his career. As a rookie with San Diego in 1994 he finished fifth in the Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award voting for the National League. Following the 1998 season, San Diego traded Hamilton to the Toronto Blue Jays. In 2001, after two seasons with the Blue Jays, he was released. Hamilton signed with the Cincinnati Reds shortly afterward. Hamilton had stints in training camps and the minor leagues with some of the Padres and Reds affiliates. In March 2005, two days after signing with the New York Mets, the team released him. Early years and college Hamilton was born on September 9, 1970, in Statesboro, Georgia to Jack Hamilton and Helen Mathis. He attended Statesboro High School before the Baltimore Orioles drafted him in the 1988 Major League Baseball draft. Hamilton decided against signing with the Orioles, opting instead to play college baseball for Georgia Southern University. As a sophomore at Georgia Southern in 1990, Hamilton had an 18‚Äì4 record with a 3.07 ERA. He was one of nine finalists for the Golden Spikes Award, and he earned Second Team All- American honors from The Sporting News and Baseball America. However, at the beginning of his junior season he went 1-3 with a 7.43 ERA after starting five games. It was soon discovered that Hamilton was suffering from elbow soreness that did not result in surgery. Hamilton held the Georgia Southern baseball record for appearances, starts, complete games, innings pitched and strikeouts until 1995. He was elected to the Georgia Southern University Athletics Department Hall of Fame in 1997. The San Diego Padres drafted Hamilton eighth overall in the 1991 Major League Baseball draft, making him the highest drafted Atlantic Sun Conference baseball player in the league's history. He eventually signed a contract with the Padres worth $415,000 after a short period in which Hamilton refused to sign a contract. He was surprised upon hearing of his selection, saying \\"It came as a bit of a shock because I really hadn't heard much from the Padres.\\" According to Hamilton's mother, Hamilton only signed the deal because his father Jack was dying of cancer, and it had been his father's dream to watch his son pitch in the major leagues. Following the draft, Hamilton joined Team USA in Canada in preparation for the Olympics. In 1992, Padres general manager Joe McIlvaine stated the Padres would have never selected Hamilton if they knew his agent was Scott Boras. McIlvaine said of the situation, \\"Basically, he lied to us. We had no idea. That's why half the time, you don't know who he represents. [Scott Boras is] very good at that. His clients are very good about keeping their mouths shut.\\" McIlvaine retracted his comments about Hamilton and Boras after Boras threatened to sue McIlvaine. Professional career=San Diego Padres= In 1992, Baseball America ranked him as the top prospect in the San Diego Padres organization and the 36th in Major League Baseball. The Padres sent Hamilton to their Single-A affiliate, the Charleston Rainbows, who were managed by future Baltimore Orioles manager Dave Trembley. With the Rainbows he went 2-2, with a 3.38 ERA in seven games and 34 innings pitched. He was then called up to the High Desert Mavericks. With High Desert, Hamilton went 4‚Äì3 with a 2.74 ERA in nine appearances. Hamilton received one more call-up, this time to Double-A. With the Wichita Wranglers he went 3-0 with a 2.86 ERA in six starts and pitched 34 innings during his time with the team. In 1993, Hamilton was ranked as the second best prospect in the Padres organization. He was sent to the Padres' affiliate, the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. One of Hamilton's teammates with the Quakes was 17-year-old and future All-Star Derrek Lee. During his time with the Quakes, he went 1-0 with a 4.09 ERA in 11 innings during two starts. The Padres then called him up to their Double-A affiliate, the Wichita Wranglers. In Wichita, Hamilton had four wins and nine losses with a 3.97 ERA in 15 starts. After a combined 39 appearances during two seasons, Hamilton was called up to Triple-A Las Vegas. With Las Vegas he went 3-2 with a 4.40 ERA in eight starts. He made his Major League debut on May 24, 1994. In the game, Hamilton allowed three runs and five hits in six innings but ended up winning the game 6-3 after Phil Clark hit a three-run home run. Overall, Hamilton went 9-6 with a 2.69 ERA in 108 innings pitched. He was fifth in the Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award voting for the National League. In 1995, Hamilton went 6-9 with a 3.08 ERA in 30 starts and 204 innings pitched. Hamilton gave up 189 hits and 70 earned runs (89 unearned). Hamilton walked 56 batters and struck out 123. At age 25 in 1996, Hamilton put up a career high in wins (15) and his second most innings pitched (211). Hamilton accrued a 4.17 ERA in 33 starts, along with 206 hits allowed and 98 earned runs. In his fourth year with San Diego in 1997, Hamilton started on Opening Day for the Padres. In the game, he pitched six innings and gave up four runs on eight hits. The Padres won the game over the New York Mets 12-6. Hamilton compiled a 12-7 record with a 4.25 ERA for the season and gave up 69 walks and struck out 124. Hamilton suffered a shoulder injury that was described as an inflammation of the rotator cuff and bursa sac. This injury forced Hamilton onto the disabled list during the 1997 season. Hamilton called the injury \\"real scary\\", saying that he feared he may lose the ability to throw . During the 1998 off- season, San Diego acquired Kevin Brown through a trade with the Florida Marlins, giving San Diego three pitchers who could throw at and above, including Hamilton. With the Padres in 1998, Hamilton's last season in San Diego, he had a 13-13 record, 4.27 ERA in 34 starts and 217 innings pitched. He walked a career-high 106 batters and struck out 147. There was a rumored trade around the 1998 MLB trade deadline that would have sent Hamilton to the Detroit Tigers, but it never materialized. During the 1998 World Series, the Padres scheduled Hamilton to pitch game four but was passed over for game one starter Kevin Brown and instead entered game three to relieve starter Sterling Hitchcock. With San Diego, Hamilton went 55 and 44 with a 3.75 ERA in 934 innings pitched. =After San Diego= After five years with San Diego, Hamilton was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays on December 12, 1998, for Peter Tucci, Carlos Almanzar, and Woody Williams. Analysts believe that Toronto acquired Hamilton if Roger Clemens's trade request was successful. Hamilton began the 1999 season with the Syracuse SkyChiefs, the Triple-A affiliate of the Blue Jays. He started three games, recording one loss, no wins, and a 5.11 ERA in 12 innings pitched. The Blue Jays called him up, and Hamilton made 18 starts in 22 games pitched. Pitching in 98 innings, he went 7-8 with a 6.52 ERA. For the second time in his career, Hamilton began the season in Syracuse and went 3-2 with a 3.66 ERA in six games and 39 innings pitched. Hamilton had a shortened 2000 season for Toronto in which he went 2-1 with a 3.55 ERA in six games. For the first time during his tenure with Toronto, Hamilton started the season with the Blue Jays. He went 5-8 with a 5.89 ERA in 22 games and 122 innings, before being released on August 3, 2001. Hamilton signed with the Cincinnati Reds on August 17, 2001, and was optioned to their Triple-A team, the Louisville Bats. He made one start in Louisville, posting a 1-0 record with a 5.40 ERA. The Reds called him up, and he made four starts and went 1-2 with a 6.23 ERA. Despite only recording one win for the team the year before, Hamilton was named the Reds' 2002 Opening Day starter. In the game, Hamilton allowed two runs on seven hits in five innings of work. The Reds won the game over the Chicago Cubs, 5-4. For the rest of the year, he spent time in Louisville and Cincinnati and posted a combined 5-10 record, 3.92 ERA, and started 20 games and pitched in relief in 22 games. According to ESPN's Peter Gammons, Hamilton, \\"looked like the '97 Hamilton\\" when he was making his comeback to the majors after spending time in the minors. At the conclusion of the 2002 season, he was offered arbitration by the Reds along with Jos√© Rijo, which they both rejected in mid-December, meaning the Reds could not sign them until May 1, 2003. =Final years= Hamilton was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals on January 6, 2003, but was released on March 26, 2003 after struggling in spring training. Hamilton then re-signed with the Cincinnati Reds on April 11, 2003. After posting a 12.66 ERA in three starts with the Reds, he was sent down to Louisville. He made 33 appearances for the Bats with an 8-3 record and a 3.23 ERA in 86 innings. On October 15, 2003, he became a free agent. The Padres re-signed Hamilton on December 10, 2003, and optioned him to their Triple-A affiliate, the Portland Beavers. Hamilton appeared in 11 games with the Beavers, posting an 0-2 record and 5.36 ERA. Hamilton was released on June 7, 2004. He was signed by the New York Mets on March 10, 2005, to a minor league contract.

This infection is a medical emergency. It should be distinguished from other forms of prostatitis such as chronic bacterial prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS).  Signs and symptoms  Men with acute prostatitis often have chills, fever, pain in the lower back, perineum, or genital area, urinary frequency and urgency often at night, burning or painful urination, body aches, and a demonstrable infection of the urinary tract, as evidenced by white blood cells and bacteria in the urine. Acute prostatitis may be a complication of prostate biopsy. Often, the prostate gland is very tender to palpation through the rectum.  Diagnosis  Abscess of the prostate (red arrow) resulting in urinary retention (blue arrow) Abscess of the prostate (red arrow) resulting in urinary retention (blue arrow) Acute prostatitis is relatively easy to diagnose due to its symptoms that suggest infection. The organism may be found in blood or urine, and sometimes in both. Common bacteria are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Serratia, and Staphylococcus aureus. This can be a medical emergency in some patients and hospitalization with intravenous antibiotics may be required. A complete blood count reveals increased white blood cells. Sepsis from prostatitis is very rare, but may occur in immunocompromised patients; high fever and malaise generally prompt blood cultures, which are often positive in sepsis. A prostate massage should never be done in a patient with suspected acute prostatitis, since it may induce sepsis. Since bacteria causing the prostatitis is easily recoverable from the urine, prostate massage is not required to make the diagnosis. Rectal palpation usually reveals an enlarged, exquisitely tender, swollen prostate gland, which is firm, warm, and, occasionally, irregular to the touch. C-reactive protein is elevated in most cases. Prostate biopsies are not indicated as the (clinical) features (described above) are diagnostic. The histologic correlate of acute prostatitis is a neutrophilic infiltration of the prostate gland. Acute prostatitis is associated with a transiently elevated PSA, i.e., the PSA is increased during an episode of acute prostatitis and then decreases again after it has resolved. PSA testing is not indicated in the context of uncomplicated acute prostatitis. Other diagnostic method is sonography Image:Gray1160.png Prostate, urethra, and seminal vesicles. Image:Gray539.pngThe arteries of the pelvis. Image:Gray1136.pngMale pelvic organs seen from right side. Treatment Micrograph showing a neutrophilic infiltration of prostatic glands - the histologic correlate of acute prostatitis. H&E; stain. Antibiotics are the first line of treatment in acute prostatitis. Antibiotics usually resolve acute prostatitis infections in a very short time, however a minimum of two to four weeks of therapy is recommended to eradicate the offending organism completely.AAFP Prostatitis Treatment Article Appropriate antibiotics should be used, based on the microbe causing the infection. Some antibiotics have very poor penetration of the prostatic capsule, others, such as ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline penetrate prostatic tissue well. In acute prostatitis, penetration of the prostate is not as important as for category II because the intense inflammation disrupts the prostate-blood barrier. It is more important to choose a bactericidal antibiotic (kills bacteria, e.g., a fluoroquinolone antibiotic) rather than a bacteriostatic antibiotic (slows bacterial growth, e.g. tetracycline) for acute potentially life-threatening infections. Severely ill patients may need hospitalization, while nontoxic patients can be treated at home with bed rest, analgesics, stool softeners, and hydration. Men with acute prostatitis complicated by urinary retention are best managed with a suprapubic catheter or intermittent catheterization. Lack of clinical response to antibiotics should raise the suspicion of an abscess and prompt an imaging study such as a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS).

This exhibit focuses on the structure-function relations of BamHI as described by Newman, et al. (1995). BamHI binds at the recognition sequence 5'-GGATCC-3', and cleaves these sequences just after the 5'-guanine on each strand. This cleavage results in sticky ends which are 4 bp long. In its unbound form, BamHI displays a central b sheet, which resides in between Œ±-helices. BamHI undergoes a series of unconventional conformational changes upon DNA recognition. This allows the DNA to maintain its normal B-DNA conformation without distorting to facilitate enzyme binding. BamHI is a symmetric dimer. DNA is bound in a large cleft that is formed between dimers; the enzyme binds in a \\"crossover\\" manner. Each BamHI subunit makes the majority of its backbone contacts with the phosphates of a DNA half site but base pair contacts are made between each BamHI subunit and nitrogenous bases in the major groove of the opposite DNA half site. The protein binds the bases through either direct hydrogen bonds or water-mediated H-bonds between the protein and every H-bond donor/acceptor group in the major groove. Major groove contacts are formed by atoms residing on the amino- terminus of a parallel 4 helix bundle. This bundle marks the BamHI dimer interface, and it is thought that the dipole moments of the NH2-terminal atoms on this bundle may contribute to electrostatic stabilization. Sites of Recognition Between BamHI and DNA The BamHI enzyme is capable of making a large number of contacts with DNA. Water-mediated hydrogen bonding, as well as both main-chain and side-chain interactions aid in binding of the BamHI recognition sequence. In the major groove, the majority of enzyme/DNA contacts take place at the amino terminus of the parallel-4-helix bundle, made up of a4 and a6 from each subunit. Although a6 from each subunit does not enter the DNA major groove, its preceding loops interact with the outer ends of the recognition site. Conversely, a4 from each subunit does enter the major groove in the center of the recognition sequence. A total of 18 bonds are formed between the enzyme and DNA across the 6 base pair recognition sequence (12 direct and 6 water mediated bonds). Arg155 and Asp154 located in a spiral ring before a6 are connected with G:C base pairs outside while the middle G:C pairs are connected with Asp154, Arg122, and Asn116 (direct binding). Hydrogen bonding between water and Asn116 results in binding at A:T base pairs inside (water-mediated binding). As discussed above, the L and R subunits bind in a cross over manner, whereby the R-subunit of BamH I contacts the left DNA half- site of the recognition sequence. The binding of each BamH I subunit is precisely the same as its symmetrical partner. The recognition site for BamH I has a palindromic sequence which can be cut in half for ease in showing bonds.  Recognition site  G G A T C C C C T A G G As of the end of 2010, there were 5 crystal structures of BamH I in the Protein Data Bank  Two-metal Mechanism  BamHI, type II restriction endonucleases, often requires divalent metals as cofactors to catalyze DNA cleavage. Two-metal ion mechanism is one of the possible catalytic mechanisms of BamHI since the BamHI crystal structure has the ability to bind two metal ions at the active site, which is suitable for the classical two-metal ion mechanism to proceed. Two-metal ion mechanism is the use of two metal ions to catalyze the cleavage reaction of restriction enzyme. BamHI has three critical active site residues that are important for metal catalyst. They are known as Asp94, Glu111 and Glu113. These residues are usually acidic. In the presence of a metal ion, the residues are pointed toward the metal ion. In the absence of metal ions, the residues are pointed outward. The two metal ions (A and B) are 4.1 apart from each other in the active site and are in-line with these residues. In general, when the two metal ions (A and B) are bonded to the active site, they help stabilize a cluster distribution of negative charges localized at the active site created by the leaving of an oxygen atom during the transition state. First, a water molecule will be activated by metal ion A at the active site. This water molecule will act as the attacking molecule attacking the BamHI-DNA complex and thus making the complex negative. Later, another water will bound to metal ion B and donate a proton to the leaving group of complex, stabilizing the build-up of negative charge on the leaving oxygen atom. The function of Ca2+ in the active site of BamHI is known. It is an inhibitor of DNA cleavage, converting BamHI into the pre-reactive state. This revealed the water molecular is the attacking molecule. It donates a proton to the leaving group that is bounded to Ca2+ forming a 90o O-P-O bond angles. If Glu 113 is replaced by lysine, the cleavage is lost since Glu 113 accepts the proton from the attacking water molecule.  Biological significance  Because of its ability to recognize specific DNA sequence and cleave by a nuclease, BamHI carries various importances in understanding Type II restriction endonuclease, cloning DNA, and possibly treating certain DNA mutation-derived diseases through genetic therapy. NARP and MILS syndromes, for example, are mitochondrial diseases that can be caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria can recover its functions after the excision of the mutant sequence through restriction endonuclease.

He was educated at Matfield Grange, a prep school in Kent, and then at the Royal Naval Colleges of Osborne and Dartmouth. He served afloat in the battleship at the Battle of Jutland, as First Lieutenant of the destroyer in the Reserve Fleet at Devonport, 1923‚Äì25, and as executive officer of from 1935‚Äì38 and was promoted captain on 31 December 1938. He took command of in August 1939. Exeter's six eight-inch guns were mainly responsible for seriously damaging the in the Battle of the River Plate in December 1939. In this battle, Exeter also incurred severe damage from seven hits by eleven-inch shells and suffered 61 killed and 23 wounded. One salvo from the Graf Spee did a great deal of damage to the wheelhouse and killed all but three of the officers in it. Bell survived with minor injuries and he ordered that the remaining turrets should continue firing on the enemy. As damage control parties battled fires and flooding, Bell used a compass from one of the lifeboats, and commanded the ship by means of commands passed along a chain of men to the lower steering compartment where a team of men struggled with a wheel that was directly connected to the rudder. After all Exeter's guns had been put out of action but still seaworthy, Bell planned to collide with the enemy, saying \\"I'm going to ram the ---. It will be the end of us but it will sink him too\\". However the Admiral Graf Spee turned to confront the other two cruisers and Bell was ordered to withdraw for repairs at the Falkland Islands. The captain, eight officers and 79 members of the crew were given the Freedom of the City of Exeter on 29 February 1940, and were welcomed by a crowd of 50,000 cheering residents. The crew marched through the streets with fixed bayonets, carrying HMS Exeter's shell-torn White Ensign through the streets. Bell also commanded in 1945. He retired from the Navy owing to ill health on 8 January 1948. In the 1956 film The Battle of the River Plate, Bell was played by John Gregson. During the film, Bell's nickname of 'Hookie', because of his distinctive nose, is used. References * .

The Atlanta Braves selected him in the first round of the 1987 MLB draft from the University of Georgia (UGA). In his MLB career, Lilliquist played for the Braves (1989‚Äì90), San Diego Padres (1990‚Äì91), Cleveland Indians (1992‚Äì94), Boston Red Sox (1995) and the Cincinnati Reds (1996). He coached in the Cardinals organization since 2002, and began serving on the major league staff in 2011. On October 3, 2017, it was announced that Lilliquist would not be back with the team for the 2018 season. While playing for UGA, Lilliquist was selected as Baseball America's Pitcher of the Year and was an All-American in 1987. In the major leagues, he functioned primarily as a relief pitcher. With Cleveland in 1992, he posted career lows in earned run average (2.25), hits per nine innings (5.7), and walks plus hits per inning pitched (0.924) while appearing in a career-high 71 games. Early life and amateur career Derek Lilliquist graduated from Sarasota High School in Sarasota, Florida in 1984. He played college baseball for the Georgia Bulldogs. In 1986 and 1987, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In 1987, Lilliquist was an All-American selection according to both the American Baseball Coaches Association and Baseball America (BA). He was also BA's Pitcher of the Year for that season. He helped lead to UGA to their first-ever Southeastern Conference title and trip to the College World Series. In three seasons at UGA, Lilliquist posted a 31‚Äì12 won‚Äìloss record and 3.30 earned run average (ERA). Professional playing career (1987‚Äì96) The Atlanta Braves selected Lilliquist as the sixth overall pick in the 1987 Major League Baseball draft and assigned him to the Gulf Coast League Braves in the Rookie League of Minor League Baseball that same season. There he made two starts, totaling 13 innings pitched (IP), allowing just three hits and no runs. He was promoted to the Durham Bulls of the Carolina League, where he made three starts, totaling 25 IP, two complete games and a 2.88 ERA. The next season, the Braves again promoted him, this time to the AAA Richmond Braves of the International League, where he spent the entire season. Lilliquist started all 28 games in which he appeared, posting a 3.38 ERA in a professional-high IP. While striking out just 80 batters, he also allowed just 36 bases on balls (BB). Facing the San Diego Padres at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego in his MLB debut on April 13, 1989, Lilliquist pitched the Braves to a 4‚Äì1 victory. In IP, he allowed just the run on three hits while earning the win. For the season, he pitched his MLB career-high innings and allowed a 3.97 ERA. However, he also allowed 202 hits for an average of 11.0 hits per nine innings pitched (H/9). He finished second in the National League (NL) in bases on balls per 9 innings pitched (BB/9) with 1.847 and fourth in the NL Rookie of the Year voting. On May 1, 1990, at Atlanta in Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium, Lilliquist become of the few pitchers to have a multi-homer game when he hit two home runs off Ron Darling in a Braves' 5‚Äì2 victory over the New York Mets. His batting statistics for the Braves that season included eight hits in 23 at bats for a .348 batting average, two home runs and three runs batted in with a .609 slugging percentage. However, his pitching had declined since his rookie year. With a 6.28 ERA and two wins and eight losses in 11 starts, the Braves traded Lilliquist to the San Diego Padres for Mark Grant on July 12, 1990. Lilliquist's only career MLB complete game and shutout occurred on August 12, 1990, in a 9‚Äì0 defeat of the Houston Astros. He allowed four hits while striking out three. With the Padres that season, he fared better, posting a 4.33 ERA. Spending most of the 1991 season in the minor leagues, the Padres assigned Lilliquist to the Las Vegas Stars of the Pacific Coast League. Here, he allowed 142 hits in 105 IP and 33 games for 5.38 ERA, contributing as both a starter and reliever. With the Padres, he allowed 14 earned runs in IP for an 8.79 ERA. The Cleveland Indians claimed Lilliquist off waivers from the Padres on November 22, 1991. He converted to full-time relief duty in 1992. Here, he posted some of his career-best numbers, including ERA, H/9, and walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP). In 71 games, he pitched innings, allowed just 39 hits for 5.7 H/9, 0.924 WHIP and a 2.25 ERA. His 71 appearances placed fourth in the American League (AL) among pitchers. He also finished 22 games and saved six. Continuing on his success in 1993, Lilliquist appeared in 56 games, posting a 2.25 ERA, 1.297 WHIP while saving ten games and finishing 28. His final year in Cleveland saw his ERA rise to 4.91 in 1994. He signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox before the 1995 season, but could not replicate his success in Cleveland. He appeared in 28 games while posting a 6.26 ERA. The Red Sox released him in July, making him a free agent. The Los Angeles Dodgers signed Lilliquist on August 1, 1995, and assigned him to their AAA minor league affiliate, the Albuquerque Dukes. They never called him up to the major leagues. He again became a free agent following the season and signed with the Cincinnati Reds for the 1996 season. The Reds assigned him to their AAA minor league affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians, where he appeared in 47 games ‚Äì all as a reliever ‚Äì and posted a 2.60 ERA. The Reds called Lilliquist up to the major leagues, where he appeared in five games. His last MLB game was on September 6, 1996, against the San Francisco Giants, where he faced one batter and gave up a hit. Pitching statistics * 262 games * 25 wins * 34 losses * 261 strikeouts * 4.13 ERA Coaching career (2002‚Äìpresent) After retiring as a player, Lilliquist coached for Vero Beach High School in Vero Beach, Florida, from 1998 to 2001. Next, he became a coach in the St. Louis Cardinals organization. In 2002, he served as the pitching coach for the Johnson City Cardinals of the Rookie League, where his pitching staff posted a 5.04 ERA and 7.8 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9) in 67 games. The next season, he handled the same role for the Class A Peoria Chiefs. This team posted a 3.48 ERA and 5.8 K/9 in 138 games. Lilliquist spent the next four seasons as the pitching coach for the Class A Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League (FSL) in Jupiter, Florida. His clubs twice made the playoffs. Palm Beach won the 2005 FSL Championship as the pitching staff registered the league's second-best ERA at 3.94. He then contributed as the Cardinals' pitching coordinator from 2008‚Äì10, helping to rehabilitate injured pitchers at the club's spring training complex in Jupiter. The Cardinals named Lilliquist as the Cardinals major league bullpen coach on November 2, 2010. Late in the Cardinals' 2011 World Series‚Äìchampionship season, he temporarily replaced incumbent pitching coach Dave Duncan, who took a leave of absence for family reasons. On January 6, 2012, the Cardinals announced that Lilliquist would permanently replace Duncan, whose future remained uncertain. On October 3, 2017, the Cardinals announced that Lilliquist would not return to the team for the 2018 season.

World War I On 10 June 1915, Heimburg, in command of sank the off Porto di Piave Vecchia in the northern Adriatic. On 6 July 1915, Heimburg, in command of with a crew of 14, torpedoed and sank the while operating under the Austrian flag off Venice. On 16 July, Heimburg sailed for the Dardanelles. This was at a time when the range of submarines was very limited, unlike today. To reach Bodrum, UB-14 had to be towed a considerable part of the distance by an Austrian destroyer. Even so, her engine broke down off Crete and her compass became defective. Despite these problems she arrived safely at Bodrum on 24 July. On arrival she recharged the batteries of the which had arrived four days earlier with engine problems. A maintenance team then had to travel from Constantinople to carry out necessary repairs to both submarines. At the time this journey was not easy being made partly by train and partly by camel. On 12 August, Heimburg sailed from Bodrum for the known steamer route between Alexandria and the Dardanelles. After leaving, Heimburg's first sighting was a fully lit hospital ship seen that evening which was not attacked. On 13 August he first sighted the liner in service as a hospital ship. He then sighted the sailing unescorted for Madras. He fired one torpedo from under a mile away which hit her stern. Royal Edward sank quickly in position 6 miles west from Kandeliusa in the Aegean Sea. The after deck was awash in three minutes and the ship had sunk with her bows in the air in six minutes. 132 members of her crew and maybe 1000 soldiers died, while figures vary. The survivors were picked up by Soudan, two French destroyers and some trawlers. Heimburg and UB-14 did not stay on to harass the rescue effort, but headed back to Bodrum with some technical problems where she arrived on the morning of the 15 August. Later in August Heimburg and UB-14 sank the Australian troopship Southland bound for Gallipoli. Approximately thirty men were killed and the remaining troops and crew were rescued by nearby ships. A skeleton crew of volunteers managed to keep the ship afloat and beach it in Moudros harbour. On 4 September, the British submarine became entangled in enemy torpedo nets off Nagara Point in the Dardanelles. All attempts to free the submarine failed. However, they had caught the attention of Heimburg, currently in harbour with UB-14 which was undergoing repairs at nearby √áanakkale. He visited the spot in a small skiff, from which he lowered a small explosive charge. E7 was forced to the surface and her crew scuttled it before they were taken as prisoners of war. On 5 November, Heimburg with UB-14 torpedoed and sank the British submarine and after taking command of he also torpedoed and sank the on 19 June 1917. On 11 August, Heino von Heimburg was awarded the Pour le M√©rite. Interwar period While interviewing German veterans of the U-boats, American journalist Lowell Thomas was introduced to Heimburg by Lothar von Arnauld de la Peri√®re. Heimburg's interview about his wartime service appeared in Thomas' 1928 book Raiders of the Deep.Lowell Thomas (1928), Raiders of the Deep, pages 131-144. World War II At the beginning of World War II, Heimburg was a judge at the Reichskriegsgericht. Until 1943, when he was retired, Heimburg served in Bremen.

Primarily a relief pitcher, Shuey pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians (1994‚Äì2002), Los Angeles Dodgers (2002‚Äì2003) and Baltimore Orioles (2007). Shuey was honored as an All- American as a college baseball pitcher for the North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team. The Indians selected Shuey with the second overall selection of the 1992 MLB draft. Envisioned as a comparable pitcher to Cincinnati Reds closer Rob Dibble, Shuey had more success as a setup reliever than closer. Injuries sidelined Shuey throughout his career, preventing him from becoming a closer. When healthy, he enjoyed success with the Indians as a setup pitcher. He was traded to the Dodgers in 2002 to be their set up man while contending for a playoff spot. He pitched well until a hip injury initially suffered in 1999 forced Shuey to retire in 2004. After an experimental medical procedure, Shuey returned to baseball briefly in 2007 with the Orioles. He retired after that season, and took up a professional career in bass fishing, competing in what he considers \\"Double-A\\"-level tournaments. Early life A native of Lima, Ohio, Shuey's family moved to North Carolina when he was ten years old. Shuey's father taught him how to pitch. He played American Legion and Babe Ruth League baseball with Everett Lindsay. Shuey attended Millbrook High School in Raleigh, North Carolina. With Millbrook, Shuey was a starting pitcher and right fielder. While pitching for the baseball team at Millbrook, Shuey threw a no-hitter against Garner High School. He was named to North Carolina's All-Triangle and All-State teams. College career Shuey enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), where he played college baseball for the North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) of NCAA Division I. He served as the team's closer. At UNC, Shuey was named a freshman All-American and All-ACC pitcher for the Tar Heels in 1990, as he had an 8-1 win‚Äìloss record and eight saves. He led the team with 31 appearances, and the Tar Heels were the ACC regular season and tournament championships. Though he suffered a patellar tendon rupture in 1991, Shuey led the Tar Heels with a 1.70 earned run average (ERA) that season. That summer, Shuey pitched for the United States national baseball team in the Pan American Games. He led the team with a 3.13 ERA and 87 strikeouts in the 1992 season, in 69 innings pitched. Shuey and Chad Holbrook won the team's S.H. Basnight Award as the team's most valuable players. Through 2001, Shuey's career winning percentage (.818) ranked fourth all time in UNC history. He was a letterman in all three seasons at UNC. Professional career=Cleveland Indians= The Indians selected Shuey with their first round draft pick, the second overall selection, in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. The Indians envisioned that Shuey could develop into a closer similar to Rob Dibble of the Cincinnati Reds. Shuey made his professional debut with the Columbus Red Stixx of the Class-A South Atlantic League in 1992. Heading into the 1993 season, Baseball America ranked Shuey as the 81st best prospect in baseball. He pitched for the Kinston Indians of the Class-A Carolina League in 1993, going 1‚Äì0 with a 4.84 ERA in 15 appearances, and was promoted to the Canton‚ÄìAkron Indians of the Class-AA Eastern League that season. He opened the 1994 season with Kinston, where he went 1‚Äì0 with a 3.75 ERA and eight saves in 13 appearances. The deaths of Indians' relief pitchers Steve Olin and Tim Crews in a boating accident heightened the Indians' need to develop Shuey. Shuey was promoted from Kinston to the major leagues during the 1994 season, becoming the first player promoted from Class-A to the majors since Greg Swindell during the 1986 season. He made his MLB debut on May 8, 1994. On May 14, Shuey became the tenth American League pitcher to strike out four batters in an inning. He also pitched for the Charlotte Knights of the Class-AAA International League that season. Baseball America ranked Shuey as the 67th best prospect in baseball heading into the 1995 season. Shuey struggled with the Indians, with an 0‚Äì3 win‚Äìloss record, five saves, and 7.00 ERA in 21 appearances in 1994 and 1995. He also pitched for the Buffalo Bisons of the International League in 1995, and spent time on the disabled list with an injured hamstring. He also pitched for the Senadores de San Juan of the Puerto Rico Baseball League that winter to gain more experience. After starting the 1996 season with Buffalo, Shuey was promoted to the Indians, where he pitched to a 5‚Äì2 record with a 2.85 ERA. He pitched in the postseason for the Indians, appearing in three games in the 1996 American League Division Series, which the Indians lost to the Baltimore Orioles. Shuey received a three-year contract from the Indians at the start of the 1997 season, worth $3,203,000 guaranteed. An option year and performance bonuses made the maximum value of the contract $11,603,000 over four seasons. Shuey with the Orioles in July 2007 With Jos√© Mesa and Mike Jackson serving as closers for the Indians, Shuey pitched in middle relief. He spent time on the disabled list in the 1997 season on three separate occasions. In 1998, he led all American League relief pitchers with a .132 (7‚Äìfor‚Äì53) batting average against when the opposition had baserunners in scoring position. His strong performances while healthy gave the Indians hope that Shuey could become their closer in due time. Shuey appeared in four postseasons for the Indians, including in 1998, when he pitched scoreless innings for the Indians in the 1998 American League Championship Series. In 1999, while pitching on a wet mound in Cleveland, Shuey injured his right hip. Over the next several seasons, he had multiple surgeries on his hip, including repairing a torn labrum and removing bone spurs. He finished the 1999 season with an 8‚Äì5 record, a 3.53 ERA, and six saves. His eight wins tied for the most among Cleveland's relief pitchers. In 2000, new Indians' manager Charlie Manuel indicated the Indians would attempt to shift Shuey into the closer role. When Shuey spent time on the disabled list, Steve Karsay served as the Indians' closer. He again spent time on the disabled list in 2001 with a strained elbow ligament. =Los Angeles Dodgers= As the 2002 trade deadline approached, teams interested in acquiring Shuey began to inquire on his availability. On July 28, 2002, before the trade deadline, Shuey was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Terry Mulholland and minor leaguers Ricardo Rodr√≠guez and Francisco Cruceta. With the Dodgers in the playoff chase that season, they hoped to pair him with closer √âric Gagn√© to form a strong bullpen for the later portions of games. Though Shuey struggled upon joining the Dodgers, recording a 9.35 ERA in his first eleven appearances after the trade, he altered his approach and began to obtain better results, allowing no runs in his next five appearances. Shuey played for the Dodgers through the end of the 2003 season. During spring training prior to the 2004 season, he tore a ligament in his thumb and reinjured his hip while fielding a bunt during his rehabilitation. Shuey spent the entire season on the disabled list. The Dodgers sued the Hartford Life Insurance Company, who insured Shuey's contract, over Shuey's $3.25 million salary for the 2004 season, saying the insurance company did not honor their claim. =Later career= A free agent after the 2004 season, Shuey signed a minor league contract with the Indians to attempt a comeback in the 2005 season. After pitching two innings for the Class-AA Akron Aeros, he retired due to pain in his right hip. Shuey sat out the whole 2006 season, as he received a hip replacement. The procedure, which involved installing a metal hip, was performed in Montreal, as it was not approved in the United States. On February 2, 2007, he signed a minor league contract with the Orioles that included an invitation to spring training. He suffered an injury and did not make the cut, and was sent to the minor leagues. He made one appearance for the Class-AA Bowie Baysox, and then joined the Norfolk Tides, the Orioles' Class-AAA affiliate. His contract was then purchased on June 19, 2007, and he appeared in that night's game against the San Diego Padres. Though his fastball was able to reach earlier in his career, Shuey's fastball had difficulty reaching due to his metal hip. On July 1, 2007, he recorded his first save since 2002, in a game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He finished the 2007 season with a 9.82 ERA in 22 games. In his penultimate appearance, in the first game of an August 22 doubleheader, he surrendered the last nine runs in a 30‚Äì3 defeat to the Texas Rangers, an American League record for most runs scored by a single team. As his fastball increased in velocity, Shuey injured his back. The Orioles gave Shuey his outright release on September 5. Personal Shuey was inducted into the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 2011 and the Millbrook High School Hall of Fame in 2012. Shuey lives with his family, including his wife Julie and three daughters; Morgan (born 1997), Casey (born 1998), and Kate (born 2006). in Wake Forest, North Carolina. He spends his time as a father, pitching coach, and bass fishing. He overcame posttraumatic stress disorder, which resulted from a car accident in 1996. Shuey competes in local bass fishing tournaments. He is hoping to compete in the Bassmaster Elite Series of the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society.

Tradition says that the great sage Agasthya lived on this peak. Noted for its abundant ayurvedic herbs, the cone shaped mountain is a centre of pilgrimage for Hindus because of Agastya, who was a confirmed bachelor. Hence, the aborigines dislike the presence of women on the hill and they are forbidden from ascending the peak.. Agasthyavanam Biological Park offers trekking opportunities.  Vizhinjam  Vizhinjam Port site About two km south of Kovalam, Vizhinjam is believed to have been an ancient port. Now, Vizhinjam is a fishing harbour, with a light house. The Portuguese and the Dutch had commercial establishments here. The Portuguese have built a church in Vizhinjam near to the sea shore, which is still functional and is referred as the Old Vizhinjam Church. It is located in the vizhinjam fishing harbour area. This place is being developed into an international deep water container transshipment terminal because of its proximity to international shipping lanes and its natural depth.

In 1997, he was named sports director and host of The Evening Sports Show. Baligian broadcast several sports for the station including OHL hockey, CCHA hockey, and was the analyst for both University of Toledo football and basketball. In 1998 he began working part-time for WJR in Detroit, doing a Sunday call-in show. He worked on the Detroit Lions post-game show with former Lion Greg Landry. He began working for WDFN in May 1999 and left WSPD in August 1999 to work for WDFN full-time. He hosted the 9:00 am‚Äì12:00 pm show It is What It Is (a reference to a quote given to reporters by former Detroit Lions running back James Stewart) as well as a weekly fantasy football show Fantasy Sports Geekly which ran from August through December. Baligian co-hosted Ice Time, a WDFN seasonal weekly hockey program, with fellow WDFN personality Greg Brady. Baligian would briefly work for both WDFN and WSPD again in 2004, and in May of that year he moved his Toledo afternoon sports talk show to WCWA when the station went all-sports. All three stations are owned by Clear Channel. Baligian writes a fantasy football blog during the football season for Mlive.com. His fantasy football column has also appeared in The Detroit News. Sean has also begun the underground movement of MEATA‚ÄîMen Eating All the Tasty Animals‚Äîin response to all the media coverage offered to PETA for its every action due to its fashionable support by certain high-profile celebrities. In celebration of all things MEATA, Sean has begun an annual barbecue-style outing where all people are extended an open invite to enjoy, which has evolved into a charity food drive. This event is simply known as MEATA, and held at a different Detroit-area location each summer. The 2007 MEATA was held in the parking lot of the Compuware Sports Arena in Plymouth, Michigan. On December 9, 2005, to protest the contract extension of Detroit Lions general manager Matt Millen, Baligian organized an \\"Angry Fan March\\" at Ford Field, where several hundred fans carried signs and chanted \\"Fire Millen!\\" and other comments for about 45 minutes. \\"This was never about hating the Lions,\\" Baligian was quoted as saying about the march. \\"It's about loving the Lions. We deserved better.\\" On October 17, 2007, Baligian was named Best Radio Sports Talk Host by the Detroit Metro Times for the people, places and things that make metro Detroit great. Sean hosted the first edition of the renamed Detroit Lions postgame show on October 21, 2007 called \\"Cornbread Corner\\". The name was chosen by the fans on an on line poll after the Lions demanded that WDFN stop calling their postgame show The WDFN Detroit Lions Postgame Show. The reference to cornbread was a running joke at WDFN: \\"eating the cornbread\\" refers to the blind optimism many Detroit Lions fans show prior to the start of the season (similar to the expression \\"drinking the Kool-Aid\\"). Another Detroit sports radio station, WXYT, owns the broadcast rights to the Lions' broadcasts and the Lions asserted that WDFN was infringing on their trademark.

Career During his youth, he moved to Missouri, and participated in Little League, Pony League, and American Legion teams. He played baseball in college for Southwest Missouri State University, and on January 12, 1982 was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 7th round. However, Bailes did not sign, and played college baseball during the spring of 1982. In the secondary phase of the draft, Bailes was drafted again, this time in the fourth round by the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 7, 1982. He signed with the team on July 1. Professional career After playing in the Pirates' farm system for a few years, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians. On May 30, 1985, the Indians traded Johnnie LeMaster to the Pirates for a player to be named later, which ended up being Bailes, who joined the Indians on July 3. He joined the Indians Major League roster for the start of the 1986 season, and made his pitching debut against the Baltimore Orioles on April 9, 1986. On April 13, he got his first win, relieving Don Schulze in the fourth inning and pitching scoreless innings to finish an 8-2 victory over the Detroit Tigers. \\"I told some of the Tigers, 'I watched you guys in the World Series two years ago,'\\" Bailes said after the game. \\"I was having some doubts that I could get people out up here, but after today I found out I can. Even the good guys, like Lance Parrish, I got them out.\\" He finished his rookie season with a 10-10 record, earning 7 saves over 62 games. He set a record for most relief wins by an Indian rookie with 8. He continued to be used as a starter, reliever, and closer the following season, starting 17 games and finishing 15. He finished with a 7-8 record, 6 saves, and a 4.64 ERA in 1987. The 1988 season saw Bailes being used primarily as a starter. He threw 5 complete games and 2 shutouts, yet was moved back into the bullpen late in the season and finished with a 9-14 record. In 1989, Bailes managed his lowest ERA to date at 4.28, however another losing record led to him being traded in the off-season. On January 9, 1990, Bailes was traded to the California Angels for Jeff Manto and minor league prospect Colin Charland. He was no longer being used as a starter, and after a few rough outings and an ERA of 6.37, Bailes was sent to the minor leagues. In 1991, Bailes was back in the bullpen, and managed an ERA of 4.18 for the season, a career best for him to that point. However, the 1992 season was a struggle for Bailes, as he finished with an ERA of 7.45, and was released by the team on October 15, 1992. He signed with the Kansas City Royals on February 25, 1993, but was released on April 3. He signed on with the Toronto Blue Jays farm system on April 25, but could not make it past the Syracuse Chiefs at the AAA level, and after being released in January 1995 he retired. After spending some time in the business field and playing for a semi-pro league in Springfield, Missouri, Bailes signed on with the Texas Rangers after the 1996 season in hopes of making a comeback. Bailes spent most of the 1997 season in the Texas Rangers' farm system, and was called up in early August. He made his first major league appearance in over four seasons on August 8, when he pitched 0.2 innings against the New York Yankees. He finished the season with an ERA of 2.86 in 24 appearances. He was granted free agency on November 6, but re-signed with the Rangers a month later. He played the full 1998 season with the Rangers, but retired after being granted free agency.

One of the regiment's most notable battles was the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690. It became the 6th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Dragoons in 1751. The regiment also fought with distinction in the Charge of the Union Brigade at the Battle of Waterloo and again as part of the successful Charge of the Heavy Brigade against superior numbers at the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War. The First World War sounded the death knell for mounted cavalry as it became apparent that technology had moved forward with greater destructive power and made horsed cavalry redundant on the modern battlefield. The British Army reorganised and reduced its cavalry corps by disbanding or amalgamating many of its famous cavalry regiments. The Inniskillings was one of those affected. It saw service for two centuries, including the First World War, before being amalgamated with 5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) Dragoon Guards to form 5th/6th Dragoons in 1922. History Sir Albert Cunningham, the first Colonel of the regiment =Formation= In 1689 James II Stuart, the dethroned King of England, landed in Ireland with aid provided by the French in an attempt to overthrow William of Orange. During the Defence of Enniskillen in 1689 the Governor of the town Gustav Hamilton raised three regiments to fight on the side of William of Orange.Witherow, p. 214 An oath was taken by each man upon a bible: > I, D. H., do hereby testify and declare, and upon the Holy Evangelists > swear, that I will own and acknowledge Gustavus Hamilton, Esq., Chief > Governor of this town of Enniskillen, and shall give due obedience to him > and my superior officers in all his and their commands, and shall to the > utmost of my power and ability defend him, them, and this place, with the > country adjacent, together with the Protestant religion and interest, with > my life and fortune, against all that shall endeavour to subvert the same. > So help me God, and the holy contents of this book.Witherow, p. 409 One of the regiments raised was a cavalry unit of Dragoons (mounted troops), first established on 20 June 1689. As was the custom of that time the regiment was named Cunningham's Dragoons (or Conyngham's Dragoons) - after its commanding officer, Sir Albert Cunningham (or Conyngham) and ranked as the 6th Dragoons. It would later become known as the \\"Enniskillen Dragoons\\", after Hamilton's headquarters at Enniskillen Castle. Inniskilling was the original name of the town - anglicised from Irish meaning 'Island of Kathleen'. Since then the name has changed around 20 times before finally settling on its present spelling of Enniskillen. =Early wars= After the relief of the Siege of Derry in 1689 the regiment continued its pursuance of the Williamite Wars. On 19 June an attempt was made to force contact with Jacobite forces under the command of Brigadier Sutherland. The \\"Enniskilliners\\" came upon a force of horse and foot at the churchyard of Belturbet and what followed is described by Thomas Witherow: > Tuesday proved to be a day of incessant rain, so that all military > operations were for the time suspended; but a Council of War was held by the > Enniskilleners, and, as it was in vain to think of overtaking Sutherland, it > was resolved to attack the party in Belturbet. Next day, Wednesday the 19th > of June, they marched forward, and when within two miles of the town, the > dragoons of both parties came in sight of each other. After an exchange of > shots, the horse of the enemy were driven back and pursued into Belturbet, > and the Enniskillen horse surrounding the church and churchyard, kept them > there till the foot came forward and secured possession of the adjoining > buildings. Having taken up their position in the houses overtopping the > churchyard, they so galled the garrison with their shot that at the end of > two hours it consented to surrender. The conditions were that all the > prisoners should have their lives, and that the officers, in addition, > should be allowed to retain their clothes and money. The result was that > nearly three hundred prisoners and a great booty fell to the victors, > consisting of two barrels of powder, seven hundred muskets, fifty-three > dragoon horses, and as many red coats as served for two companies. In > addition, a great quantity of provisions amounting to twenty tons of bread, > flour, wheat, and malt, was sent to Enniskillen by water. Thirteen > commissioned officers were detained as prisoners, but the two hundred common > soldiers were taken to Enniskillen, and were employed in erecting the fort, > which was then approaching completion. The regiment was numbered the 7th Dragoon Regiment in 1690 and fought with distinction at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690.Cannon, p. 21 In 1691 it was renamed Echlin's Dragoons (also known as the Enniskillen Horse).Witherow, p. 247 In June 1715, the regiment, by then called Stair's Dragoons or The Black Dragoons, deployed one squadron to suppress riots at Manchester, and then in November 1715 deployed troops at the Battle of Sheriffmuir during the Jacobite rising.Cannon, p. 34 The regiment went to Flanders in 1742 and fought at the Battle of Dettingen in June 1743Cannon, p. 40 and the Battle of Fontenoy in May 1745Cannon, p. 43 and the Battle of Rocoux in October 1746Cannon, p. 45 as well as the Battle of Lauffeld in July 1747 during the War of the Austrian Succession.Cannon, p. 46 The regiment was renamed the 6th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Dragoons in 1751. The regiment then fought at the Battle of Minden in August 1759Cannon, p. 56 and the Battle of Wetter also in August 1759 during the Seven Years' War.Cannon, p. 57 Memorial window at St Macartin's Cathedral, Enniskillen =The Charge of The Union Brigade at Waterloo= The Union Brigade was composed of three regiments of heavy cavalry, one English (The Royal Dragoons), one Scottish The Scots Greys and one Irish (the Inniskillings), hence their brigade title. The Inniskillings were commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Muter, who was wounded during the battle and took charge of the Brigade on the death of Major-General Sir William Ponsonby.Dalton, p. 62 > \\"The Union Cavalry Brigade was now ordered forward. The 6th/Inniskilling > Dragoons passed through the ranks of the Royal Scots and the Black Watch, > and the Royal Dragoons, further to the right, went through the 28th Foot and > passed the right flank of the Royal Scots. The Greys, who had been in a > theoretical reserve position, according to W. A. Thorburn, late curator at > the National War Museum of Scotland, \\"moved straight to their front, which > took them through the ranks of the Gordons. The head of the French Division > was now only 20 yards away and the Greys simply walked into the 1st/45th > Infantry of the Line. There was no gallop and no charge.\\" It is clear from > the French report that they did not expect to see British cavalry > materializing through the ranks of the British infantry. When the cavalry > hit them, the 45th were in the act of forming line, and their 1st battalion > was at once thrown into violent confusion, already shaken by the fire of the > 92nd. The regimental eagles were carried by the 1st battalion of all French > infantry regiments, and in a few minutes the Greys were in the midst of the > battalion, at which stage Sergeant Charles Ewart of Captain Vernor's troop > captured the eagle of the 45th. He was ordered to take it to the rear, which > he reluctantly did, but sat on his horse for sometime watching the > engagement before finally setting off for Brussels with his trophy. The rest > of the French columns believed what they saw could only be an advance guard, > and were now under the mistaken impression that they were being attacked by > large numbers of cavalry. The Royal Dragoons and 6th/Inniskilling Dragoons > charged Donzelot's Division and the Eagle of the 105th Regiment was taken by > the Royal Dragoons. These were the only two Eagles captured during the > entire Waterloo campaign. At this point the divisions of Marcognet and > Donzelot were not completely shaken, although contrary to romantic legend, > the Union Brigade did not, and could not, defeat an Army Corps of some > 16,900 infantry on their own. Having carried out a highly successful > defensive action in support of infantry, the Union Brigade lost all cohesion > and refused to recognize or hear any orders. The Greys were given the recall > several times but were so out of hand that no notice was taken. Instead they > went off on a wild rampage down the interval between the French Divisions, > NOT through the troops themselves; many Greys were shot by the surprised and > somewhat bewildered rear French battalions, who were still advancing, > unaware of the confusion on their own front, or of the defeat of their > leading brigade. In fact, the French infantry, expecting what they thought > must be the main cavalry attack (by their own massive standards), finally > brought themselves to halt, made an effort to form to receive Cavalry, and > finally fell back in considerable confusion.\\" =The Charge of the Heavy Brigade at Balaclava= William Simpson's lithograph depicting the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons at the Battle of Balaclava The regiment was deployed to the Crimea in April 1854 but during the voyage the regiment's transport ship Europa sank with the loss of the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Willoughby Moore, and 17 of his men. Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Dalrymple White took over command of the regiment and led it in action at the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854. The first assault line consisted of the Scots Greys and one squadron of the Inniskillings, a total of less than 250 sabres. Only when the RSMs declared themselves happy with the alignment did Scarlett order his bugler to sound the 'Charge'. The idea of a charge conjures up images of the Light Brigade dashing forward at speed but Dragoons were larger men with much heavier equipment so their charge was more of a trot. Floundering at obstacles such as ditches or coppices they headed towards the massed ranks of Russian cavalry, pressing on inexorably at a mere 8 miles an hour. Slow they may have been but the effect of these heavy cavalrymen slamming into the much lighter Russian cavalry stunned their enemy. A letter from a Captain of the Inniskillings illustrates the mellee which followed: > \\"Forward - dash - bang - clank, and there we were in the midst of such > smoke, cheer, and clatter, as never before stunned a mortal's ear. it was > glorious! Down, one by one, aye, two by two fell the thick skulled and over- > numerous Cossacks.....Down too alas! fell many a hero with a warm Celtic > heart, and more than one fell screaming loud for victory. I could not pause. > It was all push, wheel, frenzy, strike and down, down, down they went. Twice > I was unhorsed, and more than once I had to grip my sword tighter, the blood > of foes streaming down over the hilt, and running up my very sleeve....now > we were lost in their ranks - now in little bands battling - now in good > order together, now in and out.\\" In the words of Colonel Paget of the Light Brigade \\"It was a mighty affair, and considering the difficulties under which the Heavy Brigade laboured, and the disparity of numbers, a feat of arms which, if it ever had its equal, was certainly never surpassed in the annals of cavalry warfare, and the importance of which in its results can never be known.\\" =Late 19th century= In 1861 the regiment was renamed the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons. The regiment saw action in the response to the Indian Rebellion in 1857 and was next deployed during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. The regiment was in Scotland from 1895 until 1897, when it was posted to Ireland.Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1901 =Second Boer War= After the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899, the regiment was sent to South Africa. It formed part of General French‚Ä≤s force in the operations around Colesberg, and afterwards one squadron took part in the relief of Kimberley in February 1900. The squadrons of the regiment then rejoined, and formed part of the cavalry brigade which served in all the engagements in the general advance on Pretoria, one of the Boer capitals, which was captured on 5 June 1900. They took part in the battles of Diamond Hill (June 1900) and Belfast (August 1900), and in the following cavalry advance on Barberton in the Eastern Transvaal. The regiment subsequently joined a column under the command of Colonel Michael Rimington in the Orange River Colony, taking part in miscellaneous raids and drives there throughout the last year of the war, which ended with the Peace of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902. Following the end of the war, 257 officers and men of the regiment left Cape Town on the SS Orissa, which arrived at Southampton in late October 1902, and another 138 men arrived at Queenstown the following month on the SS Orient. After their return, the regiment was stationed at Curragh. =Early 20th century and WWI= The regiment subsequently went to India. They eventually returned from Mhow in India in August 1914 and landed at Marseille as part of the 5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade in the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division in December 1914 for service on the Western Front. During the split between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State, the regiment was among the few Irish units retained. In 1921 it was renamed The Inniskillings (6th Dragoons). It amalgamated with 5th (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) Dragoon Guards to form 5th/6th Dragoons in 1922.

The Chivilingo plant dates to 1893 when its first feasibility studies were performed for the Lota undersea coal mine operated by the Compa√±√≠a Explotadora de Lota y Coronel at depths of up to . Chief engineer William E. Raby formulated its initial plans, which settled upon the production of alternating current to feed three phase motors, powered by waterfalls of the nearby Chivilingo River. Construction work began in 1896, with civil works and the aqueduct built by the mining company, and hydraulic and electric engineering performed by Consolidated Co. of North America and Schuckert & Co. of N√ºrnberg, Germany. Two Pelton turbines powered two alternators of each (315 horsepower, 400 volts, 360 amperes, 50 Hertz). The resultant alternating current power was then transferred to the undersea mine via a 10 kilovolt transmission line approximately in length. The Chivilingo plant was in operation from 1897 to 1975, in its later years as part of the Chilean Central Interconnected System.

It was renamed as the 7th (The Princess Royal's) Dragoon Guards for Princess Charlotte in 1788. It saw service for two centuries, including the First World War, before being amalgamated with the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards, to form the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards in 1922. History William Cavendish, later Duke of Devonshire, first Colonel of the regiment During the 1688 Glorious Revolution, William Cavendish, later Duke of Devonshire raised a troop of horse to provide an escort for Princess Anne, younger daughter of James II. After he fled into exile, a number of independent troops were brought together to form Lord Cavendish's Regiment of Horse. Earl Ligonier, Colonel 1720-1749 During the Williamite War in Ireland, it fought at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690, before moving to Flanders in 1692 to serve in the Nine Years' War. It took part in the action at Dottignies in July 1693 and the siege of Namur in July 1695, before the war ended with the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick. Saved from disbandment by being transferred onto the Irish establishment, it served in Europe throughout the War of the Spanish Succession, fighting at Blenheim, Elixheim, Ramillies and Malplaquet. After the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht it returned to Ireland, where in 1720, French Huguenot exile and future Field Marshal John Ligonier took over as colonel, a position he held for 29 years. Under his command, the unit gained a reputation as one of the best trained and efficient units in the British army; between 1742 to 1747, 37 members of the regiment received battlefield commissions for distinguished service, a record 'without parallel for the period.' As late as 1913, recruits were still taught about Ligonier, while his personal crest and motto were borne by every member of the regiment. Sent back to Flanders in 1742 for the War of the Austrian Succession, the regiment fought in the battles of Dettingen and Fontenoy. At Lauffeld in July 1747, it took part in a famous charge led by Ligonier that allowed their infantry to escape what was an Allied defeat. After the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, it returned to garrison duty in Ireland. In the army reforms of 1747, it was ranked as the 4th Regiment of Horse, or the \\"Black Horse\\". It remained in Ireland until July 1760, when it fought at Warburg, during the Seven Years' War. Major Gore, the 7th Dragoon Guards, c. 1850 In 1788, it was retitled 7th (The Princess Royal's) Dragoon Guards, after Princess Charlotte. It remained in Ireland and England throughout the wars with France and helped suppress the 1798 Irish Rebellion. During the Victorian era, it was sent to South Africa in 1843, where it remained until after the 1846-1847 Xhosa War. In 1857, it was posted to India, returning home in 1867 where it remained until the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, the regiment was again sent abroad for service in South Africa. A total of 24 officers and 500 men left Southampton in the SS Armenian on 8 February 1900. The regiment fought at the Battle of Diamond Hill in June 1900. The regiment, which had been serving in Secunderabad at the start of the First World War, landed in Marseille as part of the 9th (Secunderabad) Cavalry Brigade in the 1st Indian Cavalry Division in October 1914 for service on the Western Front. A squadron from the regiment rode ten miles to capture the town of Lessines on 11 November 1918 shortly before the armistice. It was re-titled as the 7th Dragoon Guards (Princess Royal's) in 1921, and was amalgamated with the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards, to form the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards in 1922.

Max Stirner's main philosophical work was The Ego and Its Own, also known as The Ego and His Own (Der Einzige und sein Eigentum in German, or more accurately The Individual and its Property). Stirner's philosophy has been cited as an influence on both his contemporaries, most notably Karl Marx (who was strongly opposed to Stirner's views)Marx reacted to Stirner with a voluminous polemic called Saint Max that he never published; cf. Nicholas Lobkowicz: Karl Marx and Max Stirner. In: Frederick J. Adelmann (ed.): Demythologizing Marxism: A Series Of Studies On Marxism. Boston: Boston College Chestnut Hill 1969. as well as subsequent thinkers such as Friedrich Nietzsche,The possible influence on Nietzsche was a heavily disputed topic around 1900 and recently again. For a summary and a fresh view, see Bernd A. Laska: Nietzsche's Initial Crisis (2002); See also Enrico Arrigoni, Steven T. Byington, Benjamin Tucker, √âmile Armand, Albert Camus\\"Albert Camus devotes a section of The Rebel to Stirner\\". \\"The Egoism of Max Stirner\\" by Sidney Parker. and Saul Newman.  Thought = Self = Stirner argues that the concept of the self is something impossible to fully comprehend; a so-called \\"creative nothing\\" he described as an \\"end-point of language.\\" Stirner elaborated this attempt to describe the indescribable in the essay Stirner's Critics, written by Stirner in response to Feuerbach and others (in the custom of the time, he refers to himself in the third person): In order to understand this creative nothing, Stirner uses poetry and vivid imagery. The creative nothing by its dialectical shortcomings creates the need for a description, for meaning: The Ego and Its Own opens and closes with a quotation from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe that reads \\"I have taken up my cause without foundation\\", with the unstated next line of the poem being \\"and all the world is mine\\". One of Stirner's central ideas is that in realizing the self is \\"nothing\\" one is said to \\"own the world\\" because‚Äîas the book states in its last line‚Äî\\"all things are nothing to me\\" [Ibidem, p. 324]: Stirner describes this world view in brief as \\"enjoyment\\" and claims that the \\"nothingness\\" of the non-self is \\"unutterable\\" (p. 314) or \\"unnameable\\" (p. 132), \\"unspeakable\\" yet \\"a mere word\\" (p. 164; cf. Stirner's comments on the skeptic concepts ataraxia and aphasia, p. 26). = Egoism = Stirner has been broadly understood as a proponent of both psychological egoism and ethical egoism, although the latter position can be disputed as there is no claim in Stirner's writing in which one ought to pursue one's own interest and further claiming any \\"ought\\" could be seen as a new \\"fixed idea\\". Therefore, he may be understood as a rational egoist in the sense that he considered it irrational not to act in one's self- interest. However, how this self-interest is defined is necessarily subjective, allowing both selfish and altruistic normative claims to be included. Further, rationality as an end in and of itself is another fixed idea. Individual self-realization rests on each individual's desire to fulfill their egoism. The difference between an unwilling and a willing egoist is that the former will be 'possessed' by an empty idea and believe that they are fulfilling a higher cause, but usually being unaware that they are only fulfilling their own desires to be happy or secure; and the latter, in contrast, will be a person that is able to freely choose its actions, fully aware that they are only fulfilling individual desires: The contrast is also expressed in terms of the difference between the voluntary egoist being the possessor of his concepts as opposed to being possessed. Only when one realizes that all sacred truths such as law, right, morality, religion and so on are nothing other than artificial concepts and not to be obeyed can one act freely. For Stirner, to be free is to be both one's own \\"creature\\" (in the sense of 'creation') and one's own \\"creator\\" (dislocating the traditional role assigned to the gods). To Stirner, power is the method of egoism. It is the only justified method of gaining 'property'. Even love is explained as \\"consciously egoistic\\": However, Stirner cautioned against any reification of the egoist or subject: = Anarchism = Stirner proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions--including the notion of state, property as a right, natural rights in general and the very notion of society--were mere illusions or ghosts in the mind, saying of society that \\"the individuals are its reality\\". Stirner wants to \\"abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members\\".Heider, Ulrike. Anarchism: Left, Right and Green, San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95‚Äì96. He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism in which individuals would unite in a \\"Union of egoists\\" only when it was in their self-interest to do so. For him, property simply comes about through might: \\"Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property. [...] \\"What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing\\". He says: \\"I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!\\".Stirner, Max. The Ego and Its Own. p. 248. Stirner considers the world and everything in it, including other persons, available to one's taking or use without moral constraintMoggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194.‚Äîthat rights do not exist in regard to objects and people at all. He sees no rationality in taking the interests of others into account unless doing so furthers one's self- interest, which he believes is the only legitimate reason for acting. He denies society as being an actual entity: \\"The conquerors form a society which one may imagine so great that it by degrees embraces all humanity; but so- called humanity too is as such only a thought (spook); the individuals are its reality\\" (The Ego and Its Own, Tucker ed., p. 329). Stirner never referred to markets and his philosophy on property causes problems for a market system because‚Äîaccording to proponents of markets‚Äîproperty is not considered to be legitimate if taken by force. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual. He said in The Ego and Its Own:  Property  Stirner has a concept of \\"egoistic property\\" in which he is referring to the absence of moral restrictions on how the individual uses everything in the world, including other people. For Stirner, property comes about through might: \\"Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property. [...] What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing\\". He says: \\"I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!\\". This position on property is much different from the then prevalent form of individualist anarchism, which defended the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labour.Weir, David. Anarchy & Culture. University of Massachusetts Press. 1997. p. 146. However, American individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker rejected the natural rights philosophy and adopted Stirner's egoism in 1886, with several others joining with him. Since he was a radical anarchist, he preferred a political-economic social condition that was anti-statist, anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian completely void of authoritarian monopolies (whether they positioned themselves as property or sovereignty) which were the enemies of individual liberation. Stirner's egoist anarchism is all about freeing the individual from the domination of property monopolists such as monarchs, governments, or industrialists while at the same time it positions itself against the anti- individualist nature of the traditional political left. Stirner had no concrete dogma on the issue of property and simply urged individuals to stop being ruled by others regardless of the authorities' moral claims about political sovereignty or property rights.  Union of egoists  Stirner's idea of the \\"Union of egoists\\" was first expounded in The Ego and Its Own. The Union is understood as a non-systematic association, which Stirner proposed in contradistinction to the state. The Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will. The Union requires that all parties participate out of a conscious egoism. If one party silently finds themselves to be suffering, but puts up and keeps the appearance, the union has degenerated into something else. This Union is not seen as an authority above a person's own will.  Revolution  Stirner criticizes conventional notions of revolution, arguing that social movements aimed at overturning the state are tacitly statist because they are implicitly aimed at the establishment of a new state thereafter. To illustrate this argument, he compares his own social and moral role with that of Jesus Christ: As Stirner specifies in a footnote (p. 280), he was here using the word insurgent \\"in its etymological sense\\", therefore to rise above the religion and government of one's own times and to take control of one's life with no consideration of them, but not necessarily to overthrow them. This contrasts with the method of the revolutionary who brings about a change of conditions by displacing one government with another: Stirner was writing about people liberating themselves from their own limits and rising above limiting social, political and ideological conditions and for each to walk their own way. The passages quoted above are clearly incompatible with David Leopold's conclusion (in his introduction to the Cambridge University Press edition) that Stirner \\"saw humankind as 'fretted in dark superstition' but denied that he sought their enlightenment and welfare\\" (Ibidem, p. xxxii). Stirner refused to describe himself as directly liberating others, but his stated purpose in these quotations seems to be to achieve the \\"enlightenment and welfare\\" of others by way of demonstration and \\"insurrection\\" as he defines it. = Dogma = The passages quoted above show the few points of contact between Stirner's philosophy and early Christianity. It is merely Jesus as an \\"annihilator\\" of the established biases and preconceptions of Rome that Stirner can relate to. His reason for \\"citing\\" the cultural change sparked by Jesus is that he wants the Christian ideologies of 19th century Europe to collapse, much as the ideology of heathen Rome did before it (e.g. \\"[the Christian era] will end with the casting off of the ideal, with 'contempt for the spirit'\\", p. 320). As with the classical skeptics before him, Stirner's method of self-liberation is opposed to faith or belief and he envisions a life free from \\"dogmatic presuppositions\\" (p. 135, 309) or any \\"fixed standpoint\\" (p. 295). It is not merely Christian dogma that his thought repudiates, but also a wide variety of European atheist ideologies that are condemned as crypto-Christian for putting ideas in an equivalent role: What Stirner proposes is not that concepts should rule people, but that people should rule concepts. The \\"nothingness\\" of all truth is rooted in the \\"nothingness\\" of the self because the ego is the criterion of (dogmatic) truth. Again, Stirner seems closely comparable to the skeptics in that his radical epistemology directs us to emphasise empirical experience (the \\"unmediated\\" relationship of mind as world and world as mind), but it leaves only a very limited validity to the category of \\"truth\\". When we regard the impressions of the senses with detachment, simply for what they are (e.g. neither good nor evil), we may still correctly assign truth to them: In place of such systems of beliefs, Stirner presents a detached life of non-dogmatic, open-minded engagement with the world \\"as it is\\" (unpolluted by \\"faith\\" of any kind, Christian or humanist), coupled with the awareness that there is no soul, no personal essence of any kind, but that the individual's uniqueness consists solely in its \\"creative nothingness\\" prior to all concepts.  Hegel's possible influence  Scholar Lawrence Stepelevich argues that Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a major influence on The Ego and Its Own. While the latter has an \\"un-Hegelian structure and tone\\" on the whole and is hostile to Hegel's conclusions about the self and the world, Stepelevich argues that Stirner's work is best understood as answering Hegel's question of the role of consciousness after it has contemplated \\"untrue knowledge\\" and become \\"absolute knowledge\\". Stirner, Stepelevich concludes, presents the consequences of the rediscovering one's self-consciousness after realizing self-determination. However, Widukind De Ridder has argued that scholars who take Stirner's references to Hegel and the Young Hegelians as expressions of his own alleged Hegelianism are highly mistaken. De Ridder argues that The Ego and Its Own is in part a carefully constructed parody of Hegelianism, deliberately exposing its outwornness as a system of thought; and that Stirner's notions of \\"ownness\\" and \\"egoism\\" were part of his radical criticism of the implicit teleology of Hegelian dialectics.De Ridder, Widukind, \\"Max Stirner, Hegel and the Young Hegelians: A reassessment\\". In: History of European Ideas, 2008, 285‚Äì297.  Influence  Stirner was a philosopher whose \\"name appears with familiar regularity in historically-orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism\\".Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry for Max Stirner. In 1844, his The Ego and Its Own (Der Einzige und sein Eigentum which may literally be translated as The Unique Individual and Its Property)Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press. p. 177. was published and it is considered to be \\"a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism\\". For the Polish political philosopher and historian of ideas Leszek Ko≈Çakowski, there is logical explanation for the interest of the early intellectuals of fascism and proto-fascism in the individualist/egoist ideas of Stirner.

History The NRR was chartered by the New York State Legislature under The General Railroad Law of 1850 (GRL-50) on 1865-03-03, just 37 days prior to the end of the Civil War. It was a rich railroad for those days - as street railroads went - for it had a capitalization of $600,000, and an unlimited corporate life. The railroad immediately petitioned for a franchise from the City of Brooklyn, but it was denied on the grounds that the Greenpoint and Williamsburgh Railroad already had one for part of the route system the railroad was trying to get. The railroad next lobbied in Albany, and the Legislature issued the following franchise as a result, under Chapter 823, laws of 1866: CROSSTOWN: From Hunterspoint Ferry at the foot of West 2nd Street (54th Street) via the Williamsburgh, Ravenswood, and Astoria Turnpike, (Vernon Boulevard and Manhattan Avenue); Driggs Avenue (double track), Driggs Avenue/Bedford Avenue (single track each), Broadway, Rush Street, Kent Avenue, Washington Avenue, Park & Flushing Avenues (single track on each), Willoughby Street, Joralemon St, Court Street and Atlantic Avenue to South Ferry.North end of today's B-61 Crosstown bus route FRANKLIN AVENUE: From Crosstown via Washington Avenue, Montgomery Street, and Franklin to Flatbush Avenue.southern portion of today's B-48 Franklin Avenue bus line The new railroad could never establish whether it actually intended to operate, or whether it was a stalking horse for the Greenpoint and Williamsburgh Railroad, which see. The two railroads promptly solved the route problem, but not before the City of Brooklyn tried to throw a monkey wrench into the whole deal. The Nassau RR could not obtain consents for the Washington Avenue portion between Myrtle and Atlantic Avenues, and - of course - the emphasis shifted from Flatbush Village as a source of revenue to Grand Army Plaza, which was to be the most public portion of Prospect Park, which was then under construction. The legislature solved the problem by amending the earlier franchise by issuing Chapter 286, Laws of 1868, which awarded the following route: VANDERBILT AVENUE: From Washington & Park Avenues via Washington Avenue, Myrtle Avenue, and Vanderbilt Avenue to Grand Army Plaza. This established the Nassau Railroad as the first railroad on Vanderbilt Avenue, although other railroads would gain much more fame for the route than the Nassau Railroad.The middle portion of today's B69 (New York City bus) Vanderbilt Avenue Bus Line Resolution The two railroads finally admitted that they had lobbied in Albany for permission to consolidate, and the legislature consented by passing Chapter 576, Laws of 1868, which authorized the consolidation. The consolidation was consummated on July 31, 1868, and the Brooklyn City, Hunterspoint and Prospect Park Railroad was born.

The buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and together form the largest collection of buildings by the architect. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on March 2, 2012. On April 18, 2012, the AIA's Florida Chapter ranked it eighth on its list of Florida Architecture: 100 Years. 100 Places. Design Frank Lloyd Wright was retained by Florida Southern President Ludd M. Spivey in 1938 to develop a master plan for the expansion and further growth of the college's campus. Spivey gave Wright the chance to plan the campus using ideas about organic integration with the environment that the architect had been developing for some years. As basic design blocks for the campus, Wright adopted a plan based on the idea of orange groves, which have evenly spaced trees forming a grid. For construction, Wright sought the use of textile blocks, which he had developed formally a decade before in his \\"Textile Block\\" houses in California. The buildings on the Florida Southern campus could be made of concrete blocks of standard size, whose use would simplify design and construction of the buildings. These blocks would, at least in part, be formed by the college's students using local materials. The basic plan for the campus was based on ideas Wright had conceived as part of his Broadacre City idea of urban planning.  Buildings  The buildings within the District include: * Annie Pfeiffer Chapel first completed Frank Lloyd Wright structure on the campus, dedicated 1941 * Seminars (now the Financial Aid and Business Office) completed 1941 * Buckner Building (original Roux Library) completed 1946 * Watson/Fine Building (Administration Building) completed 1949 * Water Dome partially completed 1949, completed and restored in 2007 to Wright's original plans * Danforth Chapel completed 1955 * Ordway Building (originally called the Industrial Arts Building) completed 1952 * Polk County Science Building (called Polk Science by faculty and students) completed 1958 * The Esplanades various completion times, currently undergoing restoration  Sharp Family Tourism and Education Center  Opened in 2013, the Sharp Family Tourism and Education Center features a Wright-designed Usonian house and the GEICO Gift Shop.

The film stars Richard Low, Mark Lee, Christopher Lee, Chen Liping and Joanne Peh. Released in cinemas on 9 June 2004, The Best Bet earned over S$2.5 million. The film was nominated for Best Original Film Song at the 2004 Golden Horse Awards. The film portrays the lives, struggles and adventures of three friends who are addicted to gambling. They place a joint 4D bet; when they win, one is tempted to keep all the winnings to himself. This satirical comedy touches on gambling addiction and the consequences of one's actions. The success of the film spawned a television series of the same name which aired on MediaCorp Channel 8 in April 2005 and ran for 14 episodes. Four of the five lead actors except Joanne Peh continued to star in the television series. Several other new actors were added to the leading cast including Dai Qianyun as Mark Lee's idolizer, and Cheryl Chin as Mark Lee and Christopher Lee's love interest. Plot Tan Chun Huang met with his bookie friends 4D King and 4D Liang on purchasing 4-Digits lottery while leaving his Bak kut teh stall to his younger sister Huimin, who overheard a conversation on proposing ideas to promote sales for 4D while sharing his thoughts as a bookie, and began displeasing him over his gambling habits, his negligence for making a proper Bak kut teh soup and his attitude. An officer worker Lee Yong Shun was late for his meeting and lost his job, while along the way the traffic officer caught him speeding at 130 km/h while driving along with his assistant, Richard Huang, to the office, but was waived with an excuse for toilet emergency; Richard having his proposal rejected. While clearing his desk, their two co-workers, Coffee-Lady and Marcus, approaches them to asks to purchase Anita Mui's number, which exasperates Shun who tries to tell her about her addiction. While Shun was about to leave, Marcus told his story about the number of benefactors with different identities scattered across Singapore to seek for lucky four-digit numbers and how they ended up getting lucky, along with dire consequences. They quickly asked to purchase 0000 at $10 big/$10 small but Marcus stopped them before they could do so. Lee, while on the way to meet his friends, had him caught in camera for beating a red light; he immediately stopped his car, mentioning he never seen one Red light camera before; after staring at the camera, he went on to destroy the camera. Before it got destroyed, the camera managed to take a shot on a van who also had beat the red light, unbeknownst to Lee. Lee eventually meets with Huang and along with his friend, Chicken King, who asked to borrow $2,000 from Tan for a trip to Batam (who gave him two eggs as refusal), stopped him on time while having an argument with Huimin. Lee then told Huimin about the difficulty on overcoming the habits and threatens him on chopping fingers if Tan continues on before went on to order two bowls of Bak kut teh to him and his girlfriend Evita, while Huimin reveals she knows Lee left his job. Afterwards, they met to discuss on prayers and went to a nearby altar to pray for the benefactors before settled with a bowl of Bak kut teh for lunch. While they were having lunch, Huimin offered Tan an encyclopedia but he rejects it by anger citing about jinxing, leading to another argument but Lee stopped Tan saying that she was not intentional. A fake monk later appeared in front of them and ask if they want to purchase number, but Tan shoos him for scamming. After seeing his tenant, Fatty giving a red packet to the monk and scolded him for felling prey to a possible scam, the monk rush up to the table and perform a dance attracting the nearby customers, and proceed on to rub a chair using his rear, revealing the pattern with the number 3791 before getting arrested by two policemen. Seeing from a scene, Fatty went to purchase the number and when he asked Tan to purchase his number, he skeptically refuses to collect such bets due to a swindle, not long wishing not to regret if the numbers appear in the upcoming draw, although praising Lee for his actions. Huang eventually went home while noticing a neighbour was await a delivery for a refrigerator after winning over $20,000 in a lottery, his wife, which have a discern on 4D, was still lecturing him about the money that would have purchased a new refrigerator and upgrading their old Windows 95 computer into Windows XP. The neighbor was stopped by his wife not to lecture his two children into gambling, before dismissed it as a joke. While at Lee's condominium, he and Evita were conversing on their friend's luxuries and discussed on him taking on his new job with him as the company's boss. Evita notices Tan's luggage, which explains to her it was belong to his mother who would be moving in to his house, much to her annoyance. When Evita demands Tan a watch, he told she should start learning to purchase only what she needs most and by the correct needs, learning a fact they have difficulty paying the monthly installments. At night in a durian stall, Huang introduces to his two friends, both permanent residents and private tutors who recently moved from China and suggested Lee on renting a room from a condominium to them; when Huang ask for the digits, Lee told he should not depend on the 4D for money, before asking to propose on beginning a business. The next evening, while a 4D drawing was announced, a complacent Tan then began teasing people to not trust the monk on the numbers. However, much to Tan's chagrin, the number 3791 was selected as both a first and second number (the third prize missed by one digit, 3792), and missed out on winning $15,000 had he went on, angering Tan and scolding Huimin subsequently. Later on, Huang's friend left $2 deciding not to keep pocket change to his hairdresser Susan and her assistants, but his wife who went to find him snatches it, concerning a possible affair. Huang then met Tan and Lee in a snooker pool to discuss with the business proposal on selling mango desserts and endorses Lee. The next day, they visited a bank to borrow a loan to initiate a business. Ahead of the opening day, Huang's wife warned him that she went to a temple revealing that he would fail a business and revealed he never seek advice from her, but dismiss the fact the prediction is false. An infuriated Evita rushes out in anger scolding Lee for not approving her permission to let the two friends stay in his condominium; Lee explained that he needs the friends to help him pay his rent but she disagrees due to concerns on their identities as illegal immigrants. Huang and Tan met with him in his house and eventually completes the preparation for the mango desserts store. During the opening day at Alkaff Bridge, a police raid appear to come and arrest Lee after showing an image of him destroying a red light camera, while the same two females were arrested, including the two lion dancers, who engaged in a scuffle with the officers, destroying the store in the process, causing his business to go bust and landing them into a huge debt. While the police detained Lee for vandalism and harbouring, Evita broke up with him as well. Immediately after returning home, Huang notices one of the neighbour flats had the doors destroyed and smeared with red paint due to borrowing money from the loan shark and heard on the warning. On another day, Huang and Tan went into an altar hidden deep inside Bukit Timah Hill to receive blessing. Later on, Tan's bookies visited him in an hawker centre and warn him on the increase of police enforcement; 4D King handed Tan $25,000 and added interest-free for three months, and now totaling his debts to $40,000 ($15,000 was due to the bets), and to be returned within three months. While Huang went to toilet, the bookies were ambushed by the Criminal Investigation Department officers; Tan went to a toilet and make their escape with Huang, but fails. Tan beat up an officer in a last-ditch effort but another officer stopped him to warrant his arrest. The court ruled Tan a 30-month imprisonment term, but was granted a bail allowing him to meet with his family, while Huang was not jailed. At home, he purchased an arm massage for his mother and began cover up the fact for imprisonment as an overseas trip to China. Huimin presented many bowls of Bah kut teh she bought to sample; they eventually sampled a worst-tasting soup which Huimin revealed the soup belong to ours, and she told Tan that his negligence, doubled the fact learning about the arrest, lead to the disappointment of his mother. Huimin praises Tan for his creativity but criticises over for not putting his effort into his business. A week later, Tan began his imprisonment term and reunited with Lee and the fake monk as cellmates. A few days later, when Huang paid a visit to Lee inside an Inmate telephone system, Tan offered Huang a 7272 under the fake monk's influence and told to purchase legally from a government-run centre, promising to split the winnings evenly if he wins. When Huang took $300, his wife took it back and told not to spend it, reserving his money for the fees to help his son getting an asthma specialist and helping her mother to overcome liver cancer, adding on living a simple life is enough; despite refusing calls by calling Huang inhumane and their children begged him to stop, he proceeded to purchase the number thanks to the help of his friend Coffee-lady after his number was unable to enter the system; Coffee-lady revealed she was also a bookie, but not worked under 4D King or 4D Liang but working with Lee, and the fact she also run a 12 sticks gambling system. The following day, the number 7272 was revealed as a first-prize winning number and won $400,000 (with the $20,000 paid commission to Coffee-lady because she purchase privately). His wife, still angered on his purchase, later learns the fact when Huang showed her the newspaper bulletin on the 4D results. Riddled by a sum of money spread across the bed, he then evenly split the money to Lee and Tan, leaving a $120,666.66 each, but having difficulty to allocate the expenditure. His wife had aroused on greed but Huang told him that he promised to share the money. Conceiving a lie to Tan that he never purchase the number and infuriated him, they eventually managed to took an entirety of $380,000 and store it under a blanket, and eventually below the bunk. He lived in a much relaxed life and continue to visit free hair salon with Susan when she offered a cheque, while under disguise working as a taxi driver, keeping a secret on not winning the 4D. While they were driving home, they heard a radio news broadcast that a family murder occurred for illicit and deceiving his friends on a 4D winnings; his friend tried to warn him through a phone call that Fatty was murdered but Huang hang up, then a neighbouring driver but he drove off. Despite the deception, when Tan and Lee were released from the jail, they inform that they began kidnap people who purchase and won money if they won 4D under private betting; when the couple learns on the money, they uncover the blanket only to reveal a smaller sum of money left, and her wife use it onto gambling and lost, causing Huang to scold over the gambling; when his wife reveal he spend money on 4D, an argument occurred until a phone call came. After the call, Huang told the family to pack their belongings to make their escape. Lee and Tan revealed they had kidnapped Susan to lure Huang in their winnings demanding ransom. His wife was suspicious on the phone call over the increasing ransom and eventually settled for a $100,000 ransom, before noticing the contact of Susan and scold him for having an affair; after deciding to admit on keeping the money, the brothers attacked him for deception. But it actually turned out into a fantasy and seeing his wife waving a stash of cash reminding him to evenly split the winnings, and keeping a promise to make sure they have really won the prize money. Huang told Tan emotionally leading him to burst into anger. When Tan was released from jail, he was met with Lee, who released earlier and was working as a taxi driver, and took him to an empty store and met with the couple and Huimin, now revealed as workers for a F&B; business. They revealed they have spent every last of the $400,000 prize money, including a $120,000 investment onto the Bah Kut Teh shop, to prevent Tan from gambling again. Tan must reach an agreement to his friends to promise not to gamble again and work in the shop to keep their friendship, and under advice on Huimin due to his culinary skills and creativity, which he adhere to. Having learnt a lesson on gambling, Tan became a professional chef with dishes making references to the 4D and everyone were glad seeing Tan had overcome his gambling habits.

PhD Thesis, University of Sheffield, Dept of Computer Science. Abstract Based on Samuel Eilenberg's X-machine, an extended finite state machine for processing data of the type X,Samuel Eilenberg (1974) Automata, Languages and Machines, Vol. A. London: Academic Press. the Stream X-Machine is a kind of X-machine for processing a memory data type Mem with associated input and output streams In* and Out*, that is, where X = Out* √ó Mem √ó In*. The transitions of a Stream X-Machine are labelled by functions of the form œÜ: Mem √ó In ‚Üí Out √ó Mem, that is, which compute an output value and update the memory, from the current memory and an input value. Although the general X-machine had been identified in the 1980s as a potentially useful formal model for specifying software systems, M. Holcombe (1988) 'X-machines as a basis for dynamic system specification'. Software Engineering Journal 3 (2), pp. 69-76. it was not until the emergence of the Stream X-Machine that this idea could be fully exploited. Florentin Ipate and Mike Holcombe went on to develop a theory of complete functional testing,Mike Holcombe and Florentin Ipate (1998) Correct systems - building a business process solution. Applied Computing Series. Berlin: Springer-Verlag. in which complex software systems with hundreds of thousands of states and millions of transitions could be decomposed into separate SXMs that could be tested exhaustively, with a guaranteed proof of correct integration.F. Ipate and W. M. L. Holcombe (1997) 'An integration testing method which is proved to find all faults'. Int. J. Comp. Math., 63, pp. 159-178. Because of the intuitive interpretation of Stream X-Machines as \\"processing agents with inputs and outputs\\", they have attracted increasing interest, because of their utility in modelling real-world phenomena. The SXM model has important applications in fields as diverse as computational biology, software testing and agent-based computational economics.  The Stream X-Machine  A Stream X-Machine (SXM) is an extended finite state machine with auxiliary memory, inputs and outputs. It is a variant of the general X-machine, in which the fundamental data type X = Out* √ó Mem √ó In*, that is, a tuple consisting of an output stream, the memory and an input stream. A SXM separates the control flow of a system from the processing carried out by the system. The control is modelled by a finite state machine (known as the associated automaton) whose transitions are labelled with processing functions chosen from a set Œ¶ (known as the type of the machine), which act upon the fundamental data type. Each processing function in Œ¶ is a partial function, and can be considered to have the type œÜ: Mem √ó In ‚Üí Out √ó Mem, where Mem is the memory type, and In and Out are respectively the input and output types. In any given state, a transition is enabled if the domain of the associated function œÜi includes the next input value and the current memory state. If (at most) one transition is enabled in a given state, the machine is deterministic. Crossing a transition is equivalent to applying the associated function œÜi, which consumes one input, possibly modifies the memory and produces one output. Each recognised path through the machine therefore generates a list œÜ1 ... œÜn of functions, and the SXM composes these functions together to generate a relation on the fundamental data type œÜ1 ... œÜn: X ‚Üí X. = Relationship to X-machines = The Stream X-Machine is a variant of X-machine in which the fundamental data type X = Out* √ó Mem √ó In*. In the original X-machine, the œÜi are general relations on X. In the Stream X-Machine, these are usually restricted to functions; however the SXM is still only deterministic if (at most) one transition is enabled in each state. A general X-machine handles input and output using a prior encoding function Œ±: Y ‚Üí X for input, and a posterior decoding function Œ≤: X ‚Üí Z for output, where Y and Z are respectively the input and output types. In a Stream X-Machine, these types are streams: Y = In* Z = Out* and the encoding and decoding functions are defined as: Œ±(ins) = (<>, mem0, ins) Œ≤(outs, memn, <>) = outs where ins: In*, outs: Out* and memi: Mem. In other words, the machine is initialized with the whole of the input stream; and the decoded result is the whole of the output stream, provided the input stream is eventually consumed (otherwise the result is undefined). Each processing function in a SXM is given the abbreviated type œÜSXM: Mem √ó In ‚Üí Out √ó Mem. This can be mapped onto a general X-machine relation of the type œÜ: X ‚Üí X if we treat this as computing: œÜ(outs, memi, in :: ins) = (outs :: out, memi+1, ins) where \`::\` denotes concatenation of an element and a sequence. In other words, the relation extracts the head of the input stream, modifies memory and appends a value to the tail of the output stream. = Processing and Testable Properties = Because of the above equivalence, attention may focus on the way a Stream X-Machine processes inputs into outputs, using an auxiliary memory. Given an initial memory state mem0 and an input stream ins, the machine executes in a step-wise fashion, consuming one input at a time, and generating one output at a time. Provided that (at least) one recognised path path = œÜ1 ... œÜn exists leading to a state in which the input has been consumed, the machine yields a final memory state memn and an output stream outs. In general, we can think of this as the relation computed by all recognised paths:  path  : In* ‚Üí Out*. This is often called the behaviour of the Stream X-Machine. The behaviour is deterministic, if (at most) one transition is enabled in each state. This property, and the ability to control how the machine behaves in a step-wise fashion in response to inputs and memory, makes it an ideal model for the specification of software systems. If the specification and implementation are both assumed to be Stream X-Machines, then the implementation may be tested for conformance to the specification machine, by observing the inputs and outputs at each step. Laycock first highlighted the utility of single-step processing with observations for testing purposes. Holcombe and Ipate developed this into a practical theory of software testing which was fully compositional, scaling up to very large systems.F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1998) 'A method for refining and testing generalised machine specifications'. Int. J. Comp. Math. 68, pp. 197-219. A proof of correct integration guarantees that testing each component and each integration layer separately corresponds to testing the whole system. This divide-and-conquer approach makes exhaustive testing feasible for large systems. The testing method is described in a separate article on the Stream X-Machine testing methodology. See also * X-machines, a general description of the X-machine model, including a simple example. * The Stream X-Machine Testing Methodology, a complete functional testing technique. Using this methodology, it is possible to identify a finite set of tests that exhaustively determine whether an implementation matches its specification. The technique overcomes formal undecidability limitations by insisting that users apply carefully specified design for test principles during implementation. * Communicating Stream X-Machines (CSXMs), a concurrent version of the SXM model, with applications in fields ranging from social insects to economics.

She was used primarily as a convoy escort. On 14 October 1944, she was torpedoed by . She survived the attack, was towed to port and declared a constructive total loss. Magog was named for the town of Magog, Quebec. Magog was ordered in October 1941 as part of the 1942-1942 River-class building program. She was laid down on 16 June 1943 by Canadian Vickers Ltd. at Montreal and launched on 22 September 1943. Magog was commissioned into the RCN at Quebec City on 7 May 1944 with the pennant number K673. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti- submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the locks on the Lachine Canal so it was not built by the shipyards on the Great Lakes and therefore all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the West Coast or along the St. Lawrence River below Montreal. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After arriving at Halifax, Magog worked up in St. Margaret's Bay and Bermuda before returning to Montreal for repairs, completing those at Halifax in August 1944. She was assigned to escort group EG 16, which was used to patrol and escort convoys along the eastern Canadian coast. She escorted Convoy ON 256 (Liverpool-New York City), joining the convoy from 8‚Äì9 October off eastern Canada. Several days later she escorted Convoy ONS 33 (Liverpool-Halifax), joining the convoy from 13‚Äì14 October in the same waters south of Newfoundland. On 14 October 1944 Magog joined Convoy ONS 33G in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. At 1925 local time, Magog was torpedoed and damaged by U-1223 near Pointe-des-Monts, Quebec (near Baie- Trinit√©, Quebec), losing of her stern, killing 3 crew and injuring 3 others. After the torpedoing, Magog was taken in tow first by , then to the safety of a bay, and later to Quebec by the salvage tug Lord Strathcona where she was eventually declared a total constructive loss. The crew was ordered not to discuss the action at the time by the Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King. Magog was paid off 20 December 1944 to care and maintenance and was sold in 1945 to Marine Industries Ltd. from Sorel, Quebec. She was scrapped in 1947. Her only commanding officer was Lieutenant Lewis Dennis Quick, RCNR (20 March 1944 ‚Äì 20 December 1944).

They were built in 1916‚Äì1917 to gauge. Origins of the type The Belgians had designed gauge 2‚Ä≤C n2t locomotives as early as in 1900‚Äì1901 for Chemins de Fer du Calvados. The prototype was Tubize factory type 73. Weidknecht used these drawings and built similar 11-ton locomotives with subcontracted boilers, presumably built by S.A.Energie, Marcinelle. The French military circles became interested in this 2‚Ä≤C n2t locomotive type for their Decauville Light Military Railways in Morocco. A little heavier 14-ton type was designed and an order was placed for Weidknecht to produce these locomotives for the gauge lines in Morocco. Weidknecht delivered 10 more in 1913 for Chemins de fer Militaires du Maroc numbered (W1-W5 and 1-5). Baldwin built locomotives=For the French Government= When the Great War broke out in August 1914 the French lost most of their locomotive building capacity in the Northern France to German occupied area. Therefore, the French Army demanded fast replacement of the locomotive building capacity for their useful 2‚Ä≤C n2t type which had proved to be a reliable locomotive type for the lightly laid military railways. Three steam locomotive type drawings were sent to Baldwin Works (finance guaranteed by the French Government) for production of C n2t, 2‚Ä≤C n2t, and light Mallet B‚Ä≤B n4v for gauge lines. With the usual American liberty, Baldwin Drawing Office produced their \\"version Americaine\\" of these locomotive types. The first C n2t (based to Decauville design) came out in November 1914 and the first batch of 2‚Ä≤C n2t in January 1915. Only two more batches were built for the French. =For the British War Office= The British War Office decided to adopt the type as its principal military steam locomotive, and Baldwin started production in 1916, building 495 locomotives between October 1916 and April 1917. All were delivered except for nine which were lost at sea. Use outside Europe Some of the class found during war their way to other theatres of war than Europe. Baldwin 45163‚Äì45222 from batch No 1001‚Äì1104 were renumbered by the British War Office to War Department Light Railways, Middle East No 581‚Äì640 and were shipped to Egypt to be used in Sinai and Palestine during the British 1917 offensive against the Turks. After the war most of them remained in Middle East. Peacetime service After the war many of these locomotives were sold and went on to work in France, Britain and India. Indian North Western Railway received fifty locomotives, numbered NWR No 1‚Äì50, many of which later operated at sugar mills in various parts of the country. British narrow-gauge railways which used them included: * Welsh Highland Railway * Glyn Valley Tramway * Snailbeach District Railways * Ashover Light Railway Preservation Four Baldwin Class 10-12-D locomotives have been preserved in the UK, all of which had been imported from India: * No. 608, repatriated along with 44657 in 2013, currently visiting the Welsh Highland Railway * No. 778, Leighton Buzzard Light Railway * No. 794, Welsh Highland Heritage Railway * Works Nos 44657 of 1916, repatriated in March 2013 by the Statfold Barn Railway No. 778 is operational at its home base, No.794 is undergoing contract restoration at the Vale of Rheidol Railway for the WHHR, works No. 45190 (WDLR 608) is currently visiting the Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railways, and works No. 44657 is awaiting restoration, also at the SBR. One other locomotive (Baldwin 45215 of 1917) is preserved on the Dreamworld Railway in Coomera, Queensland, Australia. This locomotive worked on a sugar mill in Mackay and prior to the opening of Dreamworld in 1981 after purchase was heavily modified, including a tender, Wild-West style chimney, and conversion to oil-firing. It is currently under overhaul. In fiction The fictional No. 2 (later Stanley) in The Railway Series by the Rev. W. Awdry was based on this engine.

History=The Glorious Revolution= The origins of the King's Own Hussars lie in the 1685 Monmouth and Argyll rebellions which forced James II to borrow the Scots Brigade from his son-in-law William of Orange, later William III. On 16 June, three troops were detached from the Duke of Somerset's Royal Dragoons and their captains ordered to recruit additional volunteers from the London area, including Middlesex and Essex. The unit was based in Acton, West London to guard approaches to the City of London but the rebellion collapsed after defeat at Sedgemoor on 6 July without the regiment seeing action. Three new troops, one independent and two newly raised were now added to the original three to form The Queen Consort's Regiment of Dragoons. Alexander Cannon a Scot who previously served in the Dutch Scots Brigade was appointed Colonel in August 1687. On 5 November 1688, William III landed at Torbay in the invasion later known as the Glorious Revolution and James assembled his army on Salisbury Plain to block an advance on London. However, many now changed sides; the majority of the Queen Consort's Regiment followed Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Leveson into William's camp while Cannon and his own troop remained loyal, staying with James as he retreated to London. On 31 December, Leveson replaced Cannon as Colonel and as was customary, the regiment now took his name and became Leveson's Dragoons. =The Williamite War in Ireland= In August 1689, the regiment, numbering approximately 400 officers and men organised into six troops, was transported to Ireland to take part in the Williamite War. James had fled from England to France in December 1688, but had returned with an army in March 1689 and landed at Cork, Ireland, where he found that he had the support of a majority of the Catholic population.Bolitho, p. 11 William's expeditionary force had landed south of Belfast on 13 August, encountering little resistance from the local Catholic forces, and entered the city on 17 August; Leveson's Dragoons landed in Ireland four days later, taking up position just outside Belfast.Bolitho, pp. 13‚Äì14 Early records of the activities of the regiment are scarce, but it appears that it advanced with the rest of the Williamite forces southwards on 2 September, advancing to the town of Newry, but failing to catch the garrison of the town as it retreated. The Williamite army moved south to Dundalk, which they fortified. They did not advance any further, as a Catholic army, estimated 35,000 strong, was reportedly encamped nearby at Ardee. The regiment encountered a small Catholic force and killed five men on 20 September, but was forced to wait until October to take part in its first major action. On 27 October, 200 troopers from the regiment, along with a detachment from the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, raided Ardee, killing a number of sentries and capturing a large number of cattle and horses.Bolitho, p. 15 In November, the Williamite army moved northwards and the regiment saw action one last time before entering winter quarters at Lisburn; on 26 November, 60 troopers from the regiment were reconnoitring near Charlemont when they encountered a detachment from the town's garrison; they engage it, taking several prisoners. The regiment then retired to its winter quarters to rest and took on approximately 200 recruits shipped from England to replace losses from disease; whilst the exact casualty figures for the regiment are unknown, the entire army had suffered approximately 6,000 casualties as a result of fever, ague and dysentery by November.Bolitho, p. 16Childs, John. (1997). \\"The Williamite War 1689‚Äì1691\\". In Thomas Bartlett & Keith Jeffery (Eds.), A Military History or Ireland, p.125. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The regiment emerged from winter quarters in mid-February 1690 and immediately saw action; a gazette issued from Belfast on 14 February announced that a squadron from the regiment had formed part of a raiding force that had crossed enemy lines and burnt down a castle and looted a town, killing ten men and taking 20 prisoners. The next recorded action by the regiment took place on 22 June, when a squadron and a company of infantry from the Tangier Regiment encountered a fort garrisoned by a force of infantry and approximately 500 cavalry; the enemy force stood its ground and fought a pitched battle until its commanding officer was killed and the Catholic force retreated.Bolitho, pp. 17‚Äì18 Battle of the Boyne between James II and William III, 11 June 1690, Jan van Huchtenburg. The regiment was present for the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July, forming part of the 36,000-strong Williamite army that engaged the 25,000-strong Catholic army commanded by James II.Bolitho, p. 19 During the closing stages of the battle, a large portion of James' cavalry repeatedly charged the advancing Williamite infantry to provide protection for the retreating Catholic infantry, and were able to reach the village of Donore. The village was sited on an area of high ground from which the dismounted cavalrymen were able to fire down on the advancing Williamite troops. To counter this move, a squadron from the regiment charged up the hill and engaged the dismounted cavalry whilst the remainder of the regiment outflanked the village and attacked the Catholic force from the rear, inflicting a large number of casualties.Bolitho, p. 21 After routing this force, the regiment joined up with a Dutch cavalry unit and advanced. Sighting another Catholic cavalry force, the Dutch cavalry attacked, but were repelled with heavy losses and retreated down a narrow lane. As the Dutch regrouped, Leveson's men dismounted and took up position amongst the hedgerows lining the lane, as well as a nearby house; when the Catholic cavalry advanced down the lane, they came under fire from the regiment, inflicting heavy losses and forcing the survivors to retreat.Bolitho, p. 22 The battle was a decisive victory for the Williamite forces, with James forced to retire first to Dublin and then to France as the Williamite army advanced south and captured Dublin on 4 July. The regiment did not take part in the capture of Dublin, instead it was ordered to advance to the city of Waterford, where it accepted the surrender of the city's garrison (as well as the garrison of the nearby port of Youghal) and remained for the rest of the summer.Bolitho, p. 23 One of the regiment's troops patrolled the surrounding area, with a detachment engaging a large band of armed Catholic citizens who had been attacking Protestant settlements in the area; the detachment killed 60 and took 12 civilian prisoners, as well as attacking the village of Castlemartyr and taking its Catholic garrison prisoner. The remainder of the regiment moved to Limerick and took part in the failed siege of that city, although the specifics of what the regiment did are unknown.Bolitho, p. 24 Before the regiment retired to its winter quarters in December, it engaged and dispersed several more armed bands of civilians and came to the aid of a detachment from the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot, who had been ambushed by Catholic infantry and had taken shelter in a ruined castle; a troop from the regiment drove off the infantry and escorted the Inniskilling detachment to safety.Bolitho, pp. 24‚Äì25 The regiment left its winter quarters in February 1691 and immediately saw action, forming part of a combined force of infantry and cavalry that engaged a 2,000-strong Catholic force near Streamstown and forced it to retreat; the role that the regiment played in this action led to Leveson being promoted to Brigadier-General. In May, the majority of the Williamite army moved north and besieged the town of Athlone, which fell after eleven days, but the regiment took no part in the siege, having been ordered to encamp in the county of Mullingar. At the beginning of July, the regiment formed part of the 12,000-strong Williamite army that defeated an 8,000-strong Catholic army during the Battle of Aughrim, taking part in a massed cavalry charge that breached the Catholic positions around the village of Aughrim. The Battle of Aughrim was a decisive victory for King William, with a number of leading Catholic generals being killed, and the Williamite forces pressed their advantage; they forced the surrender of Galway on 20 July and then began a second siege of Limerick in August.Bolitho, pp. 26‚Äì27 The regiment did not take part directly in the siege, instead being detached in late August and ordered to advance south-west into Kerry to reconnoitre and harass Catholic forces in the area around Limerick. On 2 September, the regiment ambushed and routed two regiments of Catholic cavalry, and several days later subdued a number of Catholic garrisons between Cork and Limerick. The regiment inflicted a number of casualties, but more importantly captured thousands of cattle and oxen; one contemporary source states that the majority of the army's provisions for the siege of Limerick were provided by the regiment. On 22 September, Limerick fell to the Williamite forces, effectively ending the conflict in Ireland; the regiment was withdrawn to its winter quarters and was then transported to England in the spring of 1692.Bolitho, pp. 27‚Äì28 =Nine Years' War= The regiment remained in England for nearly three years before it saw battle again. During this period, in which it recruited to refill its ranks, it lost Colonel Leveson when he was promoted to the rank of Major-General by King William. (Leveson was dispatched to command forces fighting in the Spanish Netherlands as part of the English contribution to the Nine Years' War before dying in March 1699 at Belvoir Castle). He was replaced by Thomas, 5th Baron Fairfax of Cameron in January 1694; as a consequence, the regiment lost the title of Leveson's Dragoons and reverted to its previous title of The Queen's Dragoons.Bolitho, p. 31 In the spring of 1694, the regiment was reviewed by King William, along with a number of other English units, and was then transported to the Netherlands, landing at Willemstad, (nowadays in North Brabant) on 16 April. After two months, the regiment marched to join the main body of the English Army at Tirlemont in Flanders, encamping to the rear of the Army's positions in order 'to cover His Majesty's quarters'.Bolitho, p. 32 The regiment spent the summer of 1694 as part of a brigade with the Royal Horse Guards and Royal Scots Greys, taking part in manoeuvres and skirmishing with enemy troops before retiring to winter quarters in October near Ghent. By February 1695, the strength of the regiment had increased from six to eight troops, and the regiment had also gained another new commander, with Lord Fairfax being replaced by William Lloyd, previously the Lieutenant-Colonel of Essex's Dragoon's. During the summer of 1695, while the majority of the English forces were occupied with the second siege of Namur, the regiment formed part of a force that occupied the city of Diksmuide with the intention of luring away French forces that were seeking to relieve the siege of Namur. The force was successful, luring a large number of French troops away from Namur who proceeded to besiege the city; instead of holding Diksmuide as intended, however, the Danish general commanding the force surrendered the city on 18 July and, as a consequence, the regiment became prisoners of war. The officer commanding the regiment demanded that the regiment be allowed to attempt to break the siege of the city and escape, but the general denied the request.Bolitho, p. 33Childs, p. 287 Although the request was denied, many of the officers and troopers broke their weapons to deny them to the French before they surrendered. The regiment remained in captivity for several weeks, only being released when the siege of Namur was successful and the commander of the French forces there, the Duke of Boufflers, surrendered the city; after a period of negotiation with Louis XIII, Boufflers was exchanged for all English prisoners of war. After its release, the regiment retired to winter quarters and received reinforcements. Then, during the summer of 1696, it formed part of a detached Corps encamped near Nieuwpoort, Belgium, skirmishing several times with French forces when they attempted to attack the region, but never being committed to a major battle. The regiment also appears to have seen little combat during 1697, moving to Brussels sometime during the year to protect the approaches to the city and remaining there until the Treaty of Ryswick was signed in September 1697. Once the treaty was signed, signalling the end of the Nine Years' War, the regiment returned to England.Bolitho, pp. 34‚Äì35 =War of the Spanish Succession= The Battle of Vigo Bay, by Ludolf Backhuysen. The huge expense incurred by England during William III's prosecution of the Nine Years' War angered Parliament, leading to large cuts in funding for the military; these primarily affected soldiers pay, which was drastically reduced, and the withholding of gratuities that soldiers were often promised prior to going into battle. Many regiments had their strengths reduced, including The Queen's Own Dragoon's, which had its strength reduced by half. During the period of peace between the end of the Nine Years' War in 1697 and the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1702, the regiment performed a number of small tasks befitting its reduced size; it conducted coastal revenue duty, confronted smugglers, and escorted the King when he travelled to Holland.Bolitho, p. 36 The War of the Spanish Succession began in May 1702, and in June an English expeditionary force was assembled at Cowes on the Isle of Wight under the command of the Earl of Ormond, tasked with landing in Cadiz, Spain and capturing the surrounding area; 18 officers, 24 non- commissioned officers and 186 troopers from the regiment formed part of the force. It sailed from Cowes on 23 June and landed in Cadiz on 15 August, where it soon engaged Spanish forces. As the only cavalry formation with the expeditionary force, the regiment was constantly employed as picquets at the forefront of the English advance, as well as being used to guard and protect outposts.Bolitho, pp. 37‚Äì38 The regiment skirmished with Spanish forces throughout September, but an attempt to besiege Cadiz was far more difficult than was expected, ending in a Spanish victory and, as a result, the regiment was embarked on transports destined for England. During the voyage, however, the transports received word that a Spanish naval force had been sighted attempting to land near the city of Vigo. The transports turned back towards Spain, reaching Vigo on 12 October, and off-loaded the regiment. There are few details about the regiment's involvement in the ensuing Battle of Vigo Bay, but records indicate that all of the Spanish vessels involved in the attempted landing were either destroyed or burnt, and the regiment received a considerable amount of prize money for its part in the action.Bolitho, p. 38 After the battle, the regiment did not return to Spain to rejoin the English expeditionary force, but was instead ordered back to England; for a period of nearly four years the regiment remained in England, being quartered in Kent and the Isle of Wight as a garrison force, mustering for occasional parades and reviews. In December 1703, William Lloyd sold the colonelcy of the regiment to George Carpenter, who then assumed command.Bolitho, pp. 38‚Äì40 In 1706, the regiment was once again transferred to the Isle of Wight, where 240 officers, non-commissioned officers and troopers were attached to an 8,000 strong force assembling there. The force was tasked with landing on the coast of France near Charente and fighting its way inland, aided by local Protestant civilians. The fleet left England on 30 July, but the operation was cancelled due to poor weather and the failure of Dutch naval forces, who were to rendezvous with the transports and escort them to the French coast. The transports were then ordered to head for Spain, where they would land at Cadiz and reinforce English forces in the area; however, poor weather forced the ships to remain in Torbay for eleven weeks, with the troops remaining on board, until mid-August, when they attempted to sail for Lisbon. Even more severe weather meant that the ships could not be unloaded at Lisbon either, however, and they remained there for a further two months; during this time the regiment and the other English troops on board the ships suffered hundreds of casualties from a lack of proper food and water, and outbreaks of disease.Bolitho, pp. 40‚Äì41 By January 1707, the weather calmed down enough for the ships to leave Lisbon harbour and, in February, they reached Alicante, where the troops were off-loaded; of the 8,000 troops who had boarded the transports in July 1706, only 4,400 had survived.Bolitho, p. 41 The Battle of Almansa, by Filippo Pallotta and Buonaventura Ligli. (detail) The remnants of the force, including the regiment, then marched 40 miles to Caudete to link up with an Allied army composed of English, Dutch, German and Portuguese troops under the command of the Earl of Galway. This army was to support Spanish forces loyal to Charles of Austria, who claimed that he was the legitimate heir to the Spanish throne; however, this claim was contested by his opponent, Philip of Anjou, who had gathered his own army and was determined to defeat Charles in battle. The campaign against Anjou's forces began in March, with the Allies advancing, destroying several magazines and besieging the city of Villena; soon after beginning the siege, however, they were alerted by several French deserters that a large Franco-Spanish force was advancing towards Almansa to the north-east. The Earl of Galway was also informed that a second enemy force under the command of Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans was marching to reinforce the first force; in response to this information the Earl advanced immediately in an attempt to prevent the two forces from linking up. However, the manoeuvre failed, leading to the 15,000-strong Allied army being opposed by 25,000 French and Spanish troops who also possessed a superior number of artillery pieces.Bolitho, pp. 41‚Äì42 The two forces clashed during the Battle of Almansa, which began on the afternoon of 25 April. The battle began with both sides bombarding the others positions with artillery fire. After this general bombardment had ended, the Allied cavalry were dispatched to attack the centre of the Franco-Spanish positions; The Queen's Own Dragoon's were committed alongside Essex's Dragoons to attack an enemy artillery battery that was bombarding the Allied line. The regiment charged the battery and forced it to withdraw, but were then engaged by a force of Spanish cavalry that outnumbered them by approximately three to one according to regimental records, the ensuing battle 'nearly annihilated' the regiment, with its Colonel being killed along with a large number of officers and troopers.Bolitho, p. 43 The remnants of the two cavalry regiments retreated to the Allied lines, where volley-fire from the Allied infantry was beginning to inflict significant casualties on the Franco-Spanish forces; it was at this point, however, that the 7,000 Portuguese troops belonging to the Allied army suddenly deserted, starting with their cavalry and rapidly followed by the infantry. The desertion turned the tide of the battle and led to a Franco- Spanish victory, with 2,000 Allied infantrymen being taken prisoner and the remnants of the Allied army being routed. The Allied army suffered approximately 4,000 killed and wounded and another 3,000 taken prisoner; whilst there are no specific casualty numbers for the regiment, when it returned to England in the spring and began recruiting, it could only muster 150 troopers and officers.Bolitho, p. 44 =Jacobite Rising and Regimental Name Change= Member of the 3rd The King's Own Hussars (on the right) 1815 When the regiment had finished recruiting in England, it was dispatched north to Scotland. There, it formed part of the English garrison, intimidating the Scottish population in an attempt to repress any attempts at a Jacobite rising.Bolitho, p. 46 When George I ascended to the English throne in 1714, the regiment's title was once again altered, and that same year became The King's Own Regiment of Dragoons.Bolitho, p. 47 Shortly after his ascension, a major Jacobite uprising occurred; the regiment was amongst the English troops assembled in Scotland to bar the advance of the Jacobite forces. At the Battle of Sheriffmuir on 13 November, an English army commanded by the Duke of Argyll, which included the regiment, defeated a larger Jacobite army; sources are vague on the exact details of the regiment's involvement, but it is known that it formed part of the army's left wing, supporting several infantry regiments. The wing was struck by a Jacobite infantry assault, which inflicted significant casualties, but three squadrons from the regiment charged the infantry and forced it to retreat; this allowed the English forces to retire and reassemble without further loss.Bolitho, pp. 49‚Äì50 The regiment did not see any further action during the uprising, remaining with the Duke of Argyll's army, which pursued Jacobite forces as they retreated northwards. The army occupied Aberdeen on 8 February; shortly after the rebellion came to an end.Bolitho, p. 51 For a short period, the regiment was stationed at Elgin, and then was transferred to southern England, where it remained for more than 20 years; it became an understrength garrison force and did little apart from conduct occasional raids against smugglers on the English coast.Bolitho, pp. 52‚Äì53 =War of the Austrian Succession= On 20 October 1740, Charles VI died and his daughter, Maria Theresa of Austria, took his place on the Habsburg throne; the ascendancy caused a great deal of political controversy, which resulted in The War of the Austrian Succession. King George II pledged the support of Great Britain to Maria Theresa and, in May 1742, a 16,000 strong British army sailed to Ostend to link up with military forces of the Dutch Republic, which had also decided to support Maria Theresa. The King's Own Dragoons formed part of the army.Bolitho, pp. 56‚Äì57 The English forces arrived in the Dutch Republic, but did not immediately go on campaign, instead moving into winter quarters in Bruges and Ghent. The army finally departed in February 1743 and advanced towards the Rhine Valley; the regiment was chosen to form part of the advance guard.Bolitho, pp. 57‚Äì58 By June, the English army had joined Hanoverian and Austrian forces by the river Main. The Allied forces, which totalled approximately 44,000 troops, were opposed by some 70,000 French troops. After a period of marching and counter-marching, and the arrival of King George II who took personal command of the Allied forces, the French army engaged the Allies at the Battle of Dettingen on 27 June. The King's Own Dragoons were placed on the left flank of the Allied army, with instructions to protect an infantry force as it advanced. Exposed to French artillery fire for three hours, suffering heavy casualties, the regiment was eventually ordered to advance, and then clashed with a larger force of French Household Cavalry; after a fierce engagement, and more casualties, it drove off the French cavalry. Shortly after this, the French army was forced to retreat, and the remnants of the regiment participated in a general cavalry pursuit of the French forces, which inflicted further casualties.Bolitho, pp. 59‚Äì60 The regiment suffered 42 officer and other ranks killed, and 106 wounded, shrinking its size considerably; this provoked a comment from George II when he reviewed the Allied forces after the end of the battle. He asked an aide to whom the regiment belonged in a sharp tone, to which its commanding officer replied, 'Please, your Majesty, it is my regiment, and I believe the remainder of it is at Dettingen.'Boolitho, pp. 61‚Äì62 The Battle of Dettingen had brought the French advance towards the Dutch Republic to a halt, and the conflict devolved into a long series of small and indecisive battles in the Southern Netherlands. In late 1743, the regiment moved to winter quarters in Ghent and received a shipment of recruits to bolster its ranks; however, the regiment did not move from the Southern Netherlands until May 1745, when the Duke of Cumberland was dispatched to the continent to take command of the Allied army.Bolitho, p. 69 Cumberland advanced towards the city of Tournai in early May, but failed to besiege it due to its strengthened defences; a few days later, the Allied army was engaged at the Battle of Fontenoy, where it was decisively defeated by superior French forces. Unfortunately, there are no detailed records that describe the King's Own Dragoons's participation in the battle; the regiments commanding officer only noted that the regiment had launched several cavalry charges against the French line, but had been forced to retreat with the rest of the Allied army after suffering nine killed and 18 missing.Bolitho, p. 71 The Allied Army retreated back towards the Southern Netherlands, pursued by the French, but the regiment did not engage in any further fighting; instead, it was dispatched northwards to receive more recruits, and then ordered to prepare to be transported to England. On 25 July, taking advantage of the English defeat at the Battle of Fontenoy, Prince Charles Edward Stuart landed in Invernessshire and began to organise another Jacobite uprising.Bolitho, p. 72 Within a month of landing, Stuart had raised a force of 1,600 men from various Scottish clans, and began to march south, increasing his numbers to 2,500 by mid-September, when he entered Edinburgh. As the Prince advanced, the Duke of Cumberland assembled his English regiments in Flanders and then had them transported to England, arriving in London on 25 October and joining the rest of the English army at Lichfield. However, the advice of several of his senior officers, combined with a lack of support from the French and English Jacobites, prompted Stuart to order a retreat, his forces moving back north towards Scotland with the English army in pursuit. On 16 December, the advance guard of the English army, which included the King's Own Dragoons, managed to overtake the Jacobite rearguard and laid an ambush. The ambush did not completely succeed due to it being performed in the dark, and the English forces suffered more casualties than they inflicted. The regiment dismounted and fought as infantry during the ambush, clashing repeatedly with the Jacobite forces and engaging in hand-to-hand fighting, suffering a number of casualties.Bolitho, pp. 73‚Äì74 The regiment then re- mounted and pursued the Jacobite rearguard to Carlisle, being stationed near the town until it surrendered on 30 December. The records for the regiment for the next year are vague; it appears that it did see action during the Battle of Culloden in 1746, but there are no details. After the English victory at Culloden, the regiment advanced into Scotland with the rest of the English army, before being detached to Dundee; after the rebellion had been suppressed, it moved to York, where it guarded Jacobite prisoners.Bolitho, p. 74 =Seven Years' War= Uniform of the 3rd Light Dragoons, 1840s The regiment next saw action during the Raid on St Malo, destroying much of the French stores, in June 1758 during the Seven Years' War.Cannon, p. 42 It went on to equal success, destroying the vessels in the harbour, at the Raid on Cherbourg in August 1758. The regiment was stationed in Islington and was placed on guarding duties at Apsley House, the home of Lord Bathurst, during the Gordon Riots in 1780.Cannon, p. 46 =Napoleonic Wars= In July 1809, the regiment departed for the Netherlands and took part in the disastrous Walcheren Campaign: many of the men caught a disease called \\"Walcheren Fever\\", thought to be a combination of malaria and typhus, before returning home in September.Cannon, p. 52 In April 1810 the regiment was tasked with restoring order after the riots caused by protesters objecting to the incarceration of Sir Francis Burdett in the Tower of London.Cannon, p. 53 The regiment landed in Lisbon in August 1811 for service in the Peninsular War.Cannon, p. 54 It took part in the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812 and the Siege of Badajoz in March 1812Cannon, p. 55 and then undertook successful charges at the Battle of Villagarcia in April 1812Cannon, p. 57 and at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812.Cannon, p. 61 The regiment next saw action at the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813Cannon, p. 69 and then, having pursued the French Army into France, at the Battle of Toulouse in April 1814.Cannon, p. 71 The regiment returned home in July 1814.Cannon, p. 74 =Victorian era= The regiment was renamed the 3rd (The King's Own) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons in 1818. It served in Ireland between January 1820 and June 1822Cannon, p. 81 and between March 1826 and April 1829.Cannon, p. 85 It was dispatched in India in July 1837Cannon, p. 88 and, having moved on to Afghanistan, saw action at the Battle of Kabul in September 1842 during the First Anglo-Afghan War.Cannon, p. 93 It fought again at the Battle of Mudki and at the Battle of Ferozeshah in December 1845 and at the Battle of Sobraon in February 1846 during the First Anglo-Sikh War.Cannon, p. 101 It then went on to fight at the Battle of Chillianwala in January 1849 and the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849 during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. The regiment was renamed the 3rd (The King's Own) Hussars in 1861. It was posted to India in 1868, was back in England in 1879, then had a brief posting to Scotland from 1887 before they were stationed in Ireland from 1889 to 1894. The regiment was back in India in 1898.Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1903 It was deployed to South Africa in December 1901 for service in the Second Boer War and was involved in the last great drives, capturing the boers, in the north-east of the Orange River Colony. Following the end of the war in South Africa, 507 officers and men of the regiment returned to India on the SS Ionian in October 1902, where they were stationed in Sialkot in Punjab Province. =First World War= Commemorative scroll given to the family of a Lieutenant in the 3rd Hussars (1915) On the outbreak of the First World War, the regiment was stationed at Shorncliffe as part of the 4th Cavalry Brigade. On mobilisation, the brigade was assigned to the Cavalry Division of the British Expeditionary Force, and was sent to France. The 4th Brigade was assigned to the 2nd Cavalry Division in October, with which it remained for the remainder of the war, serving on the Western Front. =Inter-War period= Light Tank Mk.VIA of the 3rd King's Own Hussars. circa. 1937 The regiment was renamed the 3rd The King's Own Hussars in January 1921. It was deployed to Turkey in November 1921 as part of the British intervention force, remaining there until 24 August 1923, when it sailed to Egypt.Locations of British cavalry, infantry and machine gun units, 1914‚Äì1924. Robert W. Gould, Heraldene, 1977 In 1926, the regiment was stationed in Lucknow, India. Returning to England in 1932, the regiment was initially garrisoned in York, but moved to Tidworth in 1934. The regiment began mechanising in 1935, when it began receiving lorries, followed by armoured cars in the following year. In 1937, the regiment moved to Aldershot, where it served as the reconnaissance unit of the 2nd Infantry Division. =Second World War= A light tank MkV1B from a Light Tank Squadron of the 3rd King's Own Hussars, Oosthaven, Sumatra, Netherlands East Indies. circa. 1942. The 3rd The King's Own Hussars was brigaded with the 4th Hussars in the 1st Armoured Brigade in 1939. After the fall of France, the 3rd The King's Own Hussars was shipped to North Africa and assigned to the 7th Armoured Brigade. The regiment served in the North African Campaign. In 1941, B Squadron was sent to Singapore as reinforcements, but with the fall of Singapore, it was diverted to Java where, after a brief fight, it was ordered to surrender and the men spent the rest of the war as Prisoners of War. Fifty four members of B Squadron died as prisoners of the Japanese Army. The few survivors returned to the regiment in 1945 after the war ended. The remainder of the regiment fought as part of 9th Armoured Brigade in the Battle of El Alamein. After the campaign in North Africa, the 3rd The King's Own Hussars next saw action in the Italian Campaign, serving through 1944 and 1945. =Post-War period and amalgamation= The regiment was posted to Palestine in October 1945. It moved to Kingsway Barracks in Rendsburg in summer 1948 before transferring to Ripon Barracks in Bielefeld in 1951, to Epsom Barracks in Iserlohn in July 1953 and York Barracks in Munster in September 1957. It returned home in October 1958 to Tidworth Camp, where it amalgamated with the 7th Queen's Own Hussars, to form the Queen's Own Hussars in November 1958.

Using local transition rules, cells cannot know the total count of all the ones in system. In order to count the number of ones (or, by symmetry, the number of zeros), the system requires a logarithmic number of bits in the total size of the system. It also requires the system send messages over a distance linear in the size of the system and for the system to recognize a non-regular language. Thus, this problem is an important test case in measuring the computational power of cellular automaton systems.  Problem statement  Given a configuration of a two-state cellular automaton with i + j cells total, i of which are in the zero state and j of which are in the one state, a correct solution to the voting problem must eventually set all cells to zero if i > j and must eventually set all cells to one if i < j. The desired eventual state is unspecified if i = j. The problem can also be generalized to testing whether the proportion of zeros and ones is above or below some threshold other than 50%. In this generalization, one is also given a threshold \\\\rho; a correct solution to the voting problem must eventually set all cells to zero if \\\\tfrac{i}{i+j} < \\\\rho and must eventually set all cells to one if \\\\tfrac{j}{i+j} > \\\\rho. The desired eventual state is unspecified if \\\\tfrac{j}{i+j} = \\\\rho.  Approximate solutions  G√°cs, Kurdyumov, and Levin found an automaton that, although it does not always solve the majority problem correctly, does so in many cases. In their approach to the problem, the quality of a cellular automaton rule is measured by the fraction of the 2^{i+j} possible starting configurations that it correctly classifies. The rule proposed by Gacs, Kurdyumov, and Levin sets the state of each cell as follows. If a cell is 0, its next state is formed as the majority among the values of itself, its immediate neighbor to the left, and its neighbor three spaces to the left. If, on the other hand, a cell is 1, its next state is formed symmetrically, as the majority among the values of itself, its immediate neighbor to the right, and its neighbor three spaces to the right. In randomly generated instances, this achieves about 78% accuracy in correctly determining the majority. Das, Mitchell, and Crutchfield showed that it is possible to develop better rules using genetic algorithms.  Impossibility of a perfect classifier  In 1995, Land and Belew showed that no two-state rule with radius r and density œÅ correctly solves the voting problem on all starting configurations when the number of cells is sufficiently large (larger than about 4r/œÅ). Their argument shows that because the system is deterministic, every cell surrounded entirely by zeros or ones must then become a zero. Likewise, any perfect rule can never make the ratio of ones go above \\\\rho if it was below (or vice versa). They then show that any assumed perfect rule will either cause an isolated one that pushed the ratio over \\\\rho to be cancelled out or, if the ratio of ones is less than \\\\rho, will cause an isolated one to introduce spurious ones into a block of zeros causing the ratio of ones to be become greater than \\\\rho. In 2013, Busic, Fat√®s, Marcovici and Mairesse gave a simpler proof of the impossibility to have a perfect density classifier, which holds both for deterministic and stochastic cellular and for any dimension. Exact solution with alternative termination conditions As observed by Capcarrere, Sipper, and Tomassini, the majority problem may be solved perfectly if one relaxes the definition by which the automaton is said to have recognized the majority. In particular, for the Rule 184 automaton, when run on a finite universe with cyclic boundary conditions, each cell will infinitely often remain in the majority state for two consecutive steps while only finitely many times being in the minority state for two consecutive steps. Alternatively, a hybrid automaton that runs Rule 184 for a number of steps linear in the size of the array, and then switches to the majority rule (Rule 232), that sets each cell to the majority of itself and its neighbors, solves the majority problem with the standard recognition criterion of either all zeros or all ones in the final state. However, this machine is not itself a cellular automaton. Moreover, it has been shown that Fuk≈õ's composite rule is very sensitive to noise and cannot outperform the noisy Gacs-Kurdyumov-Levin automaton, an imperfect classifier, for any level of noise (e.g., from the environment or from dynamical mistakes).

In turn, Common responded with \\"The Bitch in Yoo.\\" = Content = Over a beat produced by Pete Rock, Common responds to verbal attacks by Westside Connection and its lead rapper Ice Cube. He claims that Ice Cube has not released a \\"dope\\" album since AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, that too many of Ice Cube's beats sample George Clinton songs, and that Cube took Common's lyrics from \\"I Used to Love H.E.R.\\" out of context. = Samples = The song contains a sample from \\"Light My Fire\\" as performed by Brian Auger's Oblivion Express. It also contains vocal samples of Raekwon from the track \\"Eye for a Eye (Your Beef Is Mines)\\" by Mobb Deep, and \\"Suspended in Time\\" by Group Home, as well as a scratched vocal sample from the song \\"A Bitch Iz A Bitch\\", by N.W.A.

A place typically has a residential nucleus and a closely spaced street pattern, and it frequently includes commercial property and other urban land uses. A place may be an incorporated place (a self-governing city, town, or village) or it may be a census-designated place (CDP). Incorporated places are defined by the laws of the states in which they are contained. The Census Bureau delineates CDPs. A small settlement in the open countryside or the densely settled fringe of a large city may not be a place as defined by the Census Bureau. As of the 1990 Census, only 26% of the people in the United States lived outside of places.Geographic Areas Reference Manual, Chapter 9 Places, United States Census Bureau, United States Department of Commerce Incorporated place An incorporated place, under the Census Bureau's definition, is a type of governmental unit incorporated under state law as a city, town (except the New England states, New York, and Wisconsin),Towns in the New England states are governmental units on the same level as cities, but are not treated as such by the Census Bureau. In Wisconsin, towns are similar to the civil townships of other states. In New York, towns have a status intermediate between those of Wisconsin and New England. borough (except in Alaska and New York),Boroughs in Alaska are analogous to counties in other states. Boroughs in New York are simultaneously counties and administrative divisions of New York City. or village, and having legally prescribed limits, powers, and functions. Requirements for incorporation vary widely among the states; some states have few specific criteria, while others have established population thresholds and occasionally other conditions (for example, minimum land area, population density, and distance from other existing incorporated places) that must be met for incorporation. The Census Bureau recognizes incorporated places in all U.S. states except Hawaii; for Hawaii, by agreement with the Office of the Governor, the Census Bureau recognizes all places as census-designated places (CDPs) rather than as incorporated places. Puerto Rico and several of the outlying areas under United States jurisdiction (such as Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands) also have no incorporated places. Different states use a variety of terms for their incorporated places. The designations \\"city\\", \\"town\\", \\"village\\", and \\"borough\\" are most frequent, but one or more places in Kentucky, Montana, Nevada, and Tennessee have place-type governments (usually consolidated ones) that do not have any of these designations. New Jersey is the only state that has all four kinds of incorporated places. Only two other states (Connecticut and Pennsylvania) include \\"boroughs\\" as incorporated places. Eleven U.S. states have only \\"cities\\", and the remainder of the states have various combinations of \\"cities\\", \\"towns\\", and \\"villages\\". Not all entities designated as \\"towns\\" and \\"boroughs\\" are considered by the Census Bureau to be places. In the six New England states, and in New York and Wisconsin, the term \\"town\\" refers to what the Census Bureau classifies as a minor civil division (MCD) rather than a place. The MCDs in these states, while often functioning with all the powers of city governments, can contain considerable rural area; outside of New England, other units of government perform the incorporated place function. In Alaska, the term \\"borough\\" refers to territory governed as a county rather than as a place; in New York, the Census Bureau treats the five boroughs that make up New York City as MCDs. Census-designated places Census-designated places (CDPs) are communities that lack separate municipal governments, and for statistical purposes are defined by the Census Bureau in order to statistically combine and compare populated areas that physically resemble incorporated places. Before each decennial census, CDPs are delineated by state and local agencies, and by tribal officials according to Census Bureau criteria. The resulting CDP delineations are then reviewed and approved by the Census Bureau. The boundaries of a CDP have no legal status and may not correspond with the local understanding of the area with the same name. Recognized communities may be divided into two or more CDPs while on the other hand, two or more communities may be combined into one CDP. A CDP may also cover the unincorporated part of a named community where the rest lies within an incorporated place. Although only about one-fifth as numerous as incorporated places (in 1990, of 23,435 \\"places\\", 19,289 were incorporated municipalities, and 4,146 were not incorporated municipalities), CDPs are important geographic units. The CDP permits the tabulation of population counts for many localities that otherwise would have no identity within the Census Bureau's framework of geographic areas. By defining an area as a CDP, that locality then appears in the same category of census data as incorporated places. This distinguishes CDPs from other census classifications, such as minor civil divisions (MCDs), which are in a separate category. In 1990, over 29 million people in the United States resided in CDPs. =Specific examples= *Bostonia, a neighborhood in northeast El Cajon, California, is an example of a CDP that covers the unincorporated part of a neighborhood that lies partly within an incorporated place. The neighborhood straddles the El Cajon city limits. The USGS places the nucleus of Bostonia well within El Cajon. The Bostonia CDP covers the greater El Cajon area in unincorporated San Diego County generally north of that part of Bostonia within El Cajon. *Shorewood-Tower Hills-Harbert, Michigan, is an example of multiple named unincorporated communities that are combined into one CDP. *Greater Upper Marlboro, Maryland, was an example of a CDP covering the unincorporated urbanized area surrounding an incorporated place. At the 2000 census, the Greater Upper Marlboro CDP completely surrounded Upper Marlboro, the county seat. However, for the 2010 census, the area was broken into several smaller CDPs, all with new names. =Outside the U.S.= Statistics Canada uses the term designated place (DPL) for unincorporated population centers. However the criteria for delineating a DPL are different from that for a CDP.Statistics Canada, Geographic Units: Designated Place (DPL) Geography The Census Bureau lists a location (latitude and longitude) for each place, although this list is not intended for general use and is part of the Bureau's TIGER mapping system to graphically represent the statistical areas used in census data. The Census Bureau's criteria for establishing the location does not correspond to the criteria used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for locating named communities, which is intended to be an authoritative reference for a place's location. The central location of a place shown on Census Bureau maps for a community may differ significantly from that on USGS maps for the same place and may even be outside the area that local residents think of as that community. The Census Bureau's location of a place is the approximate geographic center of the polygon making up the boundaries of the place at the time of the decennial census.TIGER FAQ, Question 19, \\"How did you calculate the latitude and longitude for my town...\\" The USGS location of a populated place is the center of the original place, if known, such as the city or town hall, main post office, town square or main intersection regardless of changes over time.USGS Domestic Names - Metadata (see Primary Point)USGS Frequently Asked Questions About GNIS (see question 17) NotesReferences * Geographic Areas Reference Manual United States Census Bureau, United States Department of Commerce.

He spent some time away though, being named in the Ireland Under 17s for a European Under 17 Championship qualifying tournament in Baku in Autumn 2006, but made his debut at that level for Scotland Under 17s in February 2007 against Northern Ireland. Towards the end of the campaign, he progressed into the Reserves at Norwich, making his debut on 21 February 2007 against local rivals Ipswich. He scored his first goal for the second string on 24 April 2007 against Southend. =Early senior appearances= He was named on the bench for the first time on 31 March 2007 against Colchester United.

He did however make his debut in the 2‚Äì1 win at Leicester City coming on in injury time at the end of the second half, on 14 April 2007, making him the youngest ever player to appear for Norwich City, beating Jarvis' record by 6 days, aged 16 years 276 days. Renton made his full debut three days later at Burnley replacing the injured Darren Huckerby, who had hurt his back in the warm up. For the start of the 2007‚Äì08 season, Renton was back playing with the Reserves and the Under 18s, and was scoring regularly. But against Chelsea Under 18s on 6 October he suffered a broken leg, which kept him out for the rest of the season. On 16 July 2008, having recovered from the broken leg which kept him out for most of the previous campaign, Renton signed his first professional contract with Norwich City, lasting two years. He joined King's Lynn on loan on 6 March 2009, to gain more first-team experience, but failed to score in ten appearances. =Scottish junior football= In January 2010, he was released by Norwich City and returned to his hometown, joining Scottish junior club Musselburgh Athletic. Renton helped Musselburgh to the Scottish Junior Cup final in 2010‚Äì11 before joining East Superleague champions Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic in June 2012. He moved on to local rivals Newtongrange Star in July 2014. =Scottish lower divisions= In June 2016, Renton signed for recently relegated Scottish League Two side Cowdenbeath. After impressing in his performances for Cowdenbeath, Renton was signed by Scottish League One club Alloa Athletic on 1 June 2017. He left the club in May 2018 following their promotion to the Scottish Championship.

Early life The fifth child and only son of the 7th Earl Fitzwilliam, he was born at the family's seat of Wentworth Woodhouse. On 20 July 1929, after serving as a Cadet in the Eton College Contingent (June Division) of the Officer Training Corps, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Royal Scots Greys on the Supplementary Reserve of Officers. Second World War During the Second World War, Lord Milton (as he then was) served with distinction in the Commandos and later with the Special Operations Executive, gaining a Distinguished Service Order. Family life Milton married, on 19 April 1933, Olive Dorothea \\"Obby\\" Plunket (died 1975), a daughter of Benjamin Plunket, Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry, and a granddaughter of William Plunket, 4th Baron Plunket, who was Archbishop of Dublin. They had one daughter, Lady Anne Juliet Dorothea Maud Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, born on 24 January 1935. In 1943 he inherited the Earldom and a great fortune in land, houses, and art, from his father. In Lord Fitzwilliam's later years his marriage was in disarray, partly due to Olive's alcoholism, and at the time of his death he was seeking a divorce in order to marry someone else. From 1946 he had been romantically linked with the widowed Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington, sister of the future U.S. President John F. Kennedy. She was killed with him in an air crash on 13 May 1948, although the nature of their relationship was not made clear in the newspaper accounts at the time. On his death, leaving no son, Fitzwilliam's peerages passed to his second cousin once removed, Eric Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, but his fortune, then estimated at 45 million pounds, including half of the Wentworth Woodhouse estate, the Coolattin estate in County Wicklow, Ireland, and a large part of the Fitzwilliam art collection, were inherited by his thirteen-year-old daughter, the present Lady Juliet Tadgell.

It was the first American-made gay adult animation, and was created by Joe Phillips, a comic book artist and freelance illustrator who has created art for companies such as DC Comics, Dark Horse Comics and Bud Lite. It is Phillips' first DVD movie after the first release of Phuckamon; a second, unrelated film titled Stonewall & Riot: The Ultimate Orgasm was released in late 2006 and a sequel was announced in August 2008. Overview The House of Morecock debuted in 1999 on the gay porn website AbsolutelyMale. It was originally a short Flash animation featuring Jonas Morecock, a blond-haired, blue-eyed gay twenty-something who investigates mysterious or supernatural goings-on. The stories always end with Jonas engaged in comical gay sex with apparitions, vampires, and other spooky entities. Due to its initial success, Phillips followed up the original episode with a complete set of shorts, all featuring Jonas in various scary situations which always subsequently turn sexual. Following their popularity online, the episodes were released on DVD in 2001 under the full title The House of Morecock: The Animated Misadventures of Jonas Morecock. In 2002, the DVD won a GayVN Award. TLAvideo.com lists the film as one of its best-selling DVD titles ever. In 2005, following on the success of the DVD, two sets of comic strip books were released, titled Tales From The House Of Morecock and Tales From The House Of Morecock Vol. 2, along with a set of postcards featuring the titular character. The series is considered pornography, but its content is lighthearted and is depicted in short skits. It is only considered hardcore because of graphic gay sex scenes. The stories are always comic and are intended to entertain as much as they are to arouse. Plot The movie starts off with the live-action sequence of two real-life men lying in bed watching Saturday morning cartoons. The two guys are obviously a gay couple. They then find The House of Morecock on television, and the viewer then watches what the twosome can see on their TV. We are then introduced to Jonas Morecock, and we then follow him on a series of adventures, including meeting Bigfoot, a chance encounter with a merman and being face to face with the Loch Ness Monster. All of the situations end up with Jonas having sex with at least one other guy. The film parodies a lot of mainstream television and films, including The Little Mermaid, The Blair Witch Project, Godzilla, The X-Files, Titanic, Psycho and Jaws. There are a total of ten episodes contained on the DVD, each featuring a different story involving Jonas. Reception and reviews The House of Morecock was widely praised upon its release. IN TOUCH magazine said it was an \\"original work that remains innocent even at its most explicit... a sexy and humorous collection\\". Out Front Colorado stated \\"[It] sets new trends in exotic animation\\". The Virginia Gayzette remarked, \\"Full of wit and humor. Breaks new ground. Morecock is destined to become a collectible. Finally, TLA Video said \\"Wildly imaginative! The drawings are excellent\\". Rating In the United States, Morecock is unrated, which means it does not need to pass MPAA approval, but is rated 18 Up by Kitty Media. In the United Kingdom, the film is rated R18 which means it can only be sold in licensed sex shops. In order to obtain the R18 rating, certain shots had to be cut: in total 1m 34s was removed from the original US version of the film. The uncut version is still available in the US. In other media In addition to the short cartoons, a spin-off set of books were created in 2005 by Joe Phillips, the titles of which are: * Tales From The House Of Morecock (Released June 2005) * The House Of Morecock (Postcard Book) (Released August 2005) * Tales From The House Of Morecock, Vol 2 (Released September 2005) In an online-only short movie, the audience is introduced to Justin Morecock, the younger brother of Jonas, in a tale called Goldilocks and the Three Bears in which Justin has a four-way orgy with three bears. Justin Morecock appears in this one short Flash animation only and has not been mentioned since. Visually, his appearance is almost exactly the same as Jonas, except that Justin has a middle-parting haircut.

Rau attended Texas A&M; University, and was a first-round draft pick of the Dodgers in the secondary phase of the June 1970 amateur draft, and played almost exclusively for the Dodgers in his major league career.Baseball Almanac Rau broke in with the Dodgers in 1972, earning a 2.20 ERA in 32 2/3 innings and giving up just 18 hits. In 1974, Rau became a starter and they won the NL pennant. His record was 13-11. In 1975, he went 15-9 with a 3.11 ERA. In 1976, he finished with a record of 16-12 and a 2.57 ERA, second in the National League. In 1977 and 1978, Dodgers won the pennant again and Rau was a mainstay in the starting rotation. In 1977 he went 14-8, with a winning percentage of .636, while in 1978 he went 15-9 with a winning percentage of .625. In the 1977 World Series he did not pitch effectively, but in the 1978 World Series he gave up no runs in 2 innings pitched. Rau's career was close to an end, though, because of injury problems. In 1979, he pitched in only 11 games, with a record of 1-5, and had rotator cuff surgery. He was not in the majors in 1980, and when he came back in 1981 with the California Angels, he appeared in only 3 games, going 1-2. Rau was involved in an argument during Game 4 of the 1977 World Series with manager Tommy Lasorda. After Rau gave up 2 doubles, a single and one run to start the 2nd inning, Lasorda went to the mound to remove him from the game; the two men then got into a profanity-filled argument on the mound in which fellow player Davey Lopes had to restrain them.

Baseball career Scholastically, Green graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School (Denver) (Denver, Colorado), in 1988. Green was named Gatorade National Player of the Year along with Dr. Pepper Colorado Athlete of the Year. The Cincinnati Reds drafted Green as their 2nd pick out of high school but he opted to attend Division I (D-I) baseball powerhouse Wichita State (WSU) with legendary coaches Gene Stephenson and Brent Kemnitz. As a freshman starter, Green helped the Shockers (68-16) to an NCAA D-I Championship. Earlier that year, Green was a member of the gold- medal winning Team USA and was the MVP beating Cuba 8-1 with a complete game 1-hitter and at one point retired 17 straight Cuba batters in the 1988 Jr. Olympics in Sydney Australia. His sophomore campaign was highlighted by a 9 inning no-hitter against New Mexico. After his 1989 sophomore season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and received the league's ‚ÄúOutstanding Pro Prospect‚Äù award given by the coaches and pro scouts. As a junior, he earned First Team All Missouri Valley Conference. He earned All-Tournament recognition and was named Most Outstanding Player of the 1991 MVC Classic. He ranked 7th in the nation with 134 strikeouts and 17th with an average of 10.4 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched.

Players generally play in teams of two to sixteen. One player must guess a word from their teammate's explanation, much like Charades, with the aim to guess as many possible answers in 30 seconds. The main restriction on the explanation is that it may not contain the actual word or part of the word. Objective Each team moves a token along a track formed by a sequence of squares. Each square has a different picture on it. Each round the team draws a card and then has 30 seconds to explain up to five different words printed on that card. The team can move forward one square for each correct answer. The objective is to reach the end of the track first but the team who started second needs to play last. Gameplay At the start of each round, the team throws the special 30 Seconds dice to determine that round's handicap. The dice has six sides and the values can be 0, 1 or 2. One player draws a card. Each card has a yellow side and a blue side. The player must use the side that corresponds the square that their token is on. There are five words printed on each side. The opposing team then turns over the 30-second timer. The team's score is determined by taking the number of correct answers and subtracting the handicap. The team moves their token forward by the same number of squares as their score for the current round. Clues Clues are generally short with a strong emphasis on synonyms and associations. For example, if the answer is \\"Gauteng\\" the clue might be as simple as \\"in which province is Johannesburg found?\\". A possible clue might be \\"The area which was named after the first black president of South Africa\\", to which the answer is \\"Nelson Mandela Bay\\".

Such mechanisms may include generation of new neurons, glia, axons, myelin, or synapses. Neuroregeneration differs between the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the central nervous system (CNS) by the functional mechanisms involved, especially in the extent and speed of repair. When an axon is damaged, the distal segment undergoes Wallerian degeneration, losing its myelin sheath. The proximal segment can either die by apoptosis or undergo the chromatolytic reaction, which is an attempt at repair. In the CNS, synaptic stripping occurs as glial foot processes invade the dead synapse. Nervous system injuries affect over 90,000 people every year. It is estimated that spinal cord injuries alone affect 10,000 each year. As a result of this high incidence of neurological injuries, nerve regeneration and repair, a subfield of neural tissue engineering, is becoming a rapidly growing field dedicated to the discovery of new ways to recover nerve functionality after injury. The nervous system is divided into two parts: the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which consists of cranial and spinal nerves along with their associated ganglia. While the peripheral nervous system has an intrinsic ability for repair and regeneration, the central nervous system is, for the most part, incapable of self-repair and regeneration. There is currently no treatment for recovering human nerve function after injury to the central nervous system. In addition, multiple attempts at nerve re-growth across the PNS-CNS transition have not been successful. There is simply not enough knowledge about regeneration in the central nervous system. In addition, although the peripheral nervous system has the capability for regeneration, much research still needs to be done to optimize the environment for maximum regrowth potential. Neuroregeneration is important clinically, as it is part of the pathogenesis of many diseases, including multiple sclerosis.  Peripheral nervous system regeneration  Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome ‚Äì nerve damage Neuroregeneration in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) occurs to a significant degree. After an injury to the axon, peripheral neurons activate a variety of signaling pathways which turn on pro-growth genes, leading to reformation of a functional growth cone and regeneration. The growth of these axons is also governed by chemotactic factors secreted from Schwann cells. Injury to the peripheral nervous system immediately elicits the migration of phagocytes, Schwann cells, and macrophages to the lesion site in order to clear away debris such as damaged tissue which is inhibitory to regeneration. When a nerve axon is severed, the end still attached to the cell body is labeled the proximal segment, while the other end is called the distal segment. After injury, the proximal end swells and experiences some retrograde degeneration, but once the debris is cleared, it begins to sprout axons and the presence of growth cones can be detected. The proximal axons are able to regrow as long as the cell body is intact, and they have made contact with the Schwann cells in the endoneurium (also known as the endoneurial tube or channel). Human axon growth rates can reach 2 mm/day in small nerves and 5 mm/day in large nerves. The distal segment, however, experiences Wallerian degeneration within hours of the injury; the axons and myelin degenerate, but the endoneurium remains. In the later stages of regeneration the remaining endoneurial tube directs axon growth back to the correct targets. During Wallerian degeneration, Schwann cells grow in ordered columns along the endoneurial tube, creating a band of B√ºngner cells that protects and preserves the endoneurial channel. Also, macrophages and Schwann cells release neurotrophic factors that enhance re-growth.  Central nervous system regeneration  Unlike peripheral nervous system injury, injury to the central nervous system is not followed by extensive regeneration. It is limited by the inhibitory influences of the glial and extracellular environment. The hostile, non-permissive growth environment is, in part, created by the migration of myelin-associated inhibitors, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursors, and microglia. The environment within the CNS, especially following trauma, counteracts the repair of myelin and neurons. Growth factors are not expressed or re-expressed; for instance, the extracellular matrix is lacking laminins. Glial scars rapidly form, and the glia actually produce factors that inhibit remyelination and axon repair; for instance, NOGO and NI-35. The axons themselves also lose the potential for growth with age, due to a decrease in GAP43 expression, among others. Slower degeneration of the distal segment than that which occurs in the peripheral nervous system also contributes to the inhibitory environment because inhibitory myelin and axonal debris are not cleared away as quickly. All these factors contribute to the formation of what is known as a glial scar, which axons cannot grow across. The proximal segment attempts to regenerate after injury, but its growth is hindered by the environment. It is important to note that central nervous system axons have been proven to regrow in permissive environments; therefore, the primary problem to central nervous system axonal regeneration is crossing or eliminating the inhibitory lesion site. Another problem is that the morphology and functional properties of central nervous system neurons are highly complex, for this reason a neuron functionally identical cannot be replaced by one of another type (Llin√°s' law).  Inhibition of axonal regrowth  Glial cell scar formation is induced following damage to the nervous system. In the central nervous system, this glial scar formation significantly inhibits nerve regeneration, which leads to a loss of function. Several families of molecules are released that promote and drive glial scar formation. For instance, transforming growth factors B-1 and -2, interleukins, and cytokines play a role in the initiation of scar formation. The accumulation of reactive astrocytes at the site of injury and the up regulation of molecules that are inhibitory for neurite outgrowth contribute to the failure of neuroregeneration. The up-regulated molecules alter the composition of the extracellular matrix in a way that has been shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth extension. This scar formation involves several cell types and families of molecules. =Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan= In response to scar-inducing factors, astrocytes up regulate the production of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Astrocytes are a predominant type of glial cell in the central nervous system that provide many functions including damage mitigation, repair, and glial scar formation. The RhoA pathway is involved. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) have been shown to be up regulated in the central nervous system (CNS) following injury. Repeating disaccharides of glucuronic acid and galactosamine, glycosaminoglycans (CS- GAGs), are covalently coupled to the protein core CSPGs. CSPGs have been shown to inhibit regeneration in vitro and in vivo, but the role that the CSPG core protein vs. CS-GAGs had not been studied until recently. =Keratan sulfate proteoglycans= Like the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, keratan sulfate proteoglycan (KSPG) production is up regulated in reactive astrocytes as part of glial scar formation. KSPGs have also been shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth extension, limiting nerve regeneration. Keratan sulfate, also called keratosulfate, is formed from repeating disaccharide galactose units and N-acetylglucosamines. It is also 6-sulfated. This sulfation is crucial to the elongation of the keratan sulfate chain. A study was done using N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice. The wild type mouse showed a significant up regulation of mRNA expressing N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 at the site of cortical injury. However, in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice, the expression of keratan sulfate was significantly decreased when compared to the wild type mice. Similarly, glial scar formation was significantly reduced in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 mice, and as a result, nerve regeneration was less inhibited. =Other inhibitory factors= Proteins of oligodendritic or glial debris origin that influence neuroregeneration: *NOGO ‚ÄìThe protein family Nogo, particularly Nogo-A, has been identified as an inhibitor of remyelination in the CNS, especially in autoimmune mediated demyelination, such as found in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Nogo A functions via either its amino-Nogo terminus through an unknown receptor, or by its Nogo-66 terminus through NgR1, p75, TROY or LINGO1. Antagonising this inhibitor results in improved remyelination, as it is involved in the RhoA pathway. *NI-35 a non-permissive growth factor from myelin. *MAG ‚ÄìMyelin-associated glycoprotein acts via the receptors NgR2, GT1b, NgR1, p75, TROY and LINGO1. *OMgp ‚ÄìOligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein *Ephrin B3 functions through the EphA4 receptor and inhibits remyelination. *Sema 4D(Semaphorin 4D) functions through the PlexinB1 receptor and inhibits remyelination. *Sema 3A (Semaphorin 3A) is present in the scar that forms in both central nervous system and peripheral nerve injuries and contributes to the outgrowth-inhibitory properties of these scars  Clinical treatments =Surgery= Surgery can be done in case a peripheral nerve has become cut or otherwise divided. This is called peripheral nerve reconstruction. The injured nerve is identified and exposed so that normal nerve tissue can be examined above and below the level of injury, usually with magnification, using either loupes or an operating microscope. If a large segment of nerve is harmed, as can happen in a crush or stretch injury, the nerve will need to be exposed over a larger area. Injured portions of the nerve are removed. The cut nerve endings are then carefully reapproximated using very small sutures. The nerve repair must be covered by healthy tissue, which can be as simple as closing the skin or it can require moving skin or muscle to provide healthy padded coverage over the nerve.The Southern Orthopaedic Association > Patient Education: Nerve Repair and Grafting in the Upper Extremity 2006. Retrieved on Jan 12, 2009 The type of anesthesia used depends on the complexity of the injury. A surgical tourniquet is almost always used.  Prognosis  The expectations after surgical repair of a divided peripheral nerve depends on several factors: * Age: Recovery of a nerve after surgical repair depends mainly on the age of the patient. Young children can recover close-to-normal nerve function. In contrast, a patient over 60 years old with a cut nerve in the hand would expect to recover only protective sensation; that is, the ability to distinguish hot/cold or sharp/dull. *The mechanism of injury: Sharp injuries, such as a knife wound, damage only a very short segment of the nerve, availing for direct suture. In contrast, nerves that are divided by stretch or crush may be damaged over long segments. These nerve injuries are more difficult to treat and generally have a poorer outcome. In addition, associated injuries, like injury to bone, muscle and skin, can make nerve recovery more difficult. *The level of injury: After a nerve is repaired, the regenerating nerve endings must grow all the way to their target. For example, a nerve injured at the wrist that normally provides sensation to the thumb must grow to the end of the thumb in order to provide sensation. The return of function decreases with increased distance over which a nerve must grow.  Autologous nerve grafting  Currently, autologous nerve grafting, or a nerve autograft, is known as the gold standard for clinical treatments used to repair large lesion gaps in the peripheral nervous system. It is important that nerves are not repaired under tension, which could otherwise happen if cut ends are reapproximated across a gap. Nerve segments are taken from another part of the body (the donor site) and inserted into the lesion to provide endoneurial tubes for axonal regeneration across the gap. However, this is not a perfect treatment; often the final outcome is only limited function recovery. Also, partial de-innervation is frequently experienced at the donor site, and multiple surgeries are required to harvest the tissue and implant it. When appropriate, a nearby donor may be used to supply innervation to lesioned nerves. Trauma to the donor can be minimized by utilizing a technique known as end-to-side repair. In this procedure, an epineurial window is created in the donor nerve and the proximal stump of the lesioned nerve is sutured over the window. Regenerating axons are redirected into the stump. Efficacy of this technique is partially dependent upon the degree of partial neurectomy performed on the donor, with increasing degrees of neurectomy giving rise to increasing axon regeneration within the lesioned nerve, but with the consequence of increasing deficit to the donor. Some evidence suggests that local delivery of soluble neurotrophic factors at the site of autologous nerve grafting may enhance axon regeneration within the graft and help expedite functional recovery of a paralyzed target. Other evidence suggests that gene- therapy induced expression of neurotrophic factors within the target muscle itself can also help enhance axon regeneration. Accelerating neuroregeneration and the reinnervation of a denervated target is critically important in order to reduce the possibility of permanent paralysis due to muscular atrophy.  Allografts and xenografts  Variations on the nerve autograft include the allograft and the xenograft. In allografts, the tissue for the graft is taken from another person, the donor, and implanted in the recipient. Xenografts involve taking donor tissue from another species. Allografts and xenografts have the same disadvantages as autografts, but in addition, tissue rejection from immune responses must also be taken into account. Often immunosuppression is required with these grafts. Disease transmission also becomes a factor when introducing tissue from another person or animal. Overall, allografts and xenografts do not match the quality of outcomes seen with autografts, but they are necessary when there is a lack of autologous nerve tissue. = Nerve guidance conduit = Because of the limited functionality received from autografts, the current gold standard for nerve regeneration and repair, recent neural tissue engineering research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits in order to guide axonal regrowth. The creation of artificial nerve conduits is also known as entubulation because the nerve ends and intervening gap are enclosed within a tube composed of biological or synthetic materials.Phillips, J.B., et al., Neural Tissue Engineering: A self-organizing collagen guidance conduit. Tissue Engineering, 2005. 11(9/10): p. 1611-1617. = Immunisation = A direction of research is towards the use of drugs that target remyelinating inhibitor proteins, or other inhibitors. Possible strategies include vaccination against these proteins (active immunisation), or treatment with previously created antibodies (passive immunisation). These strategies appear promising on animal models with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Monoclonal antibodies have also been used against inhibitory factors such as NI-35 and NOGO.

He arrived with the First Fleet in 1788, and was opposed to those who plotted against Governor William Bligh. One of eight children, John Palmer was born in Portsmouth. He first came to Sydney in 1788 as Purser on the Sirius, the flagship of the First Fleet. In September 1796 he left briefly for England in the Britannia to bring back his family to settle permanently in New South Wales. He returned in November 1800 on board the Porpoise with his wife and two surviving sons out of his then six children. One son had been born on the voyage out at Cape Town, but had died at sea less than one month later and before they had reached Sydney. Also with him was an unmarried naval officer brother Christopher Palmer (1767‚Äì1821), and two unmarried sisters Sarah Sophia Palmer (1774‚Äì?) and Sophia Palmer (1777‚Äì1833). In 1801, Sophia married the merchant Robert Campbell and John Palmer acted as his agent during Campbell's absence in England in 1805 and 1806. Palmer was appointed commissary general of New South Wales on 2 June 1791. In this post, he was responsible for the reception and issue of all government stores, virtually the only supplies in the colony, and their supplement by purchase from private merchants. He negotiated payment for official business and was empowered to draw bills on the British Treasury. In effect, he kept the public accounts and funds of the colony and was at once official supplier, contractor and banker to the settlement. Whilst in England in the period 1810 to 1814, Palmer was demoted to Assistant Commissary in 1811, but in June 1813 was re-employed in the Commissariat. He returned to New South Wales in May 1814, where he continued to work for the Commissariat until he was retired on half-pay in 1819. Palmer received his first land grant of 100 acres (40 ha) in 1793, which he named Woolloomooloo Farm. Here, he planted an extensive orchard, built one of the colony's first permanent residences, and elegantly entertained the first rank of colonial society. In 1795, he was described as one of the three principal farmers and stockholders in the colony. In 1803, Palmer was hailed as the first exponent of improved farming methods when he reduced the men employed on his 300-acre (121 ha) Hawkesbury farm from a hundred to fifteen. Also by 1803, he owned several small colonial- built craft. Palmer also owned a windmill on the margin of the Domain and a bakery near the present Conservatorium of Music. In 1818, he was granted 1500 acres (607 ha) at Bathurst, which he named Hambledon, where he ran a handful of stock. In the 1820s, Palmer received a grant in the Limestone Plains known as Jerrabombera. At Waddon, near Parramatta, he farmed 3000 acres (1214 ha), one-third of which was cleared. By the 1830s, he was running more than 3000 sheep and nearly 500 cattle. In his judicial capacity as a magistrate, which he had been appointed by Lieutenant Governor Francis Grose in 1793, and as one of the principal civil officers, Palmer was familiar with most of the disturbances that occurred in the colony. He was no friend of John Macarthur, or of most of the New South Wales Corps. A supporter of Governor William Bligh, he had in 1809 briefly been placed in gaol in Sydney on a charge of sedition for having declaring New South Wales to be in a state of mutiny. Palmer denied the competency of the court and refused to plead, but was found guilty and sentenced to three months imprisonment and directed to pay a fine of ¬£50. He also continued to refuse to allow Lieutenant Governor George Johnston access to his ledgers without the authority of the British Treasury. In 1810, he was ordered to England with Bligh. Considered a hostile witness by Bligh's opponents, his evidence was considered as indispensable in proving charges against Bligh. Instead he was one of Bligh's chief witnesses against Johnston. Palmer was a member of the Committee of the Female Orphan Institution from August 1803 to January 1824. As a magistrate, he sat frequently on the bench at Parramatta until dismissed by Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane over a quarrel in 1822. He was restored to the magistracy on 3 November 1825 and continued to sit until within a year or two of his death. When he died at Waddon near Parramatta on 27 September 1833, he was the last surviving officer of the first fleet that arrived in this part of His Majesty's Dominions.

During an 11-year major league career, Trombley pitched for the Minnesota Twins (‚Äì and ), Baltimore Orioles (‚Äì) and Los Angeles Dodgers (2001). Education Trombley attended Minnechaug Regional High School (1985) and Deerfield Academy (1986). He attended Duke University in Durham, North Carolina and graduated in 1990. In 1988, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Professional career=Minnesota Twins= He was drafted in the 14th round by the Minnesota Twins in 1989. He made his major league debut for the Twins in 1992, with the team in a pennant race. He went 3-2 with a 3.30 ERA in 46 innings, which earned him the team's Rookie of the Year Award. Trombley played with many well-known players in 1993, including Kirby Puckett, Rick Aguilera and Dave Winfield. Early in his career, Trombley contributed to Indians designated hitter Eddie Murray's 3000th hit on June 30, 1995. He was sent to AAA for a short time, which drove him to start using a split finger fastball. In 1996, Trombley was recalled from AAA Salt Lake City to the Twins in 1996, and would be one of the most prominent relief pitchers in the league. He finished in the top six in appearances from 1998 through 2000. In 1999, when he was a free agent, Trombley posted 24 saves, which led to him signing a three-year deal with the Baltimore Orioles for $7.75 million. His departure left the Twins looking for a closer. The team had hoped to keep Trombley; Twins general manager Terry Ryan said, \\"That certainly puts a hole in the back end of our bullpen, so we're going to have to start making alternative plans.\\". Trombley pitched 634 innings for the Twins and ended his Twins career with 30 wins, 34 losses, and 34 saves. =Baltimore Orioles and Los Angeles Dodgers= Trombley played for the Baltimore Orioles for three years, until he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2001. He would pitch for the Dodgers for one year and return for a short time for the Twins, before retiring in 2002.

Mechanism Most temperature-sensitive mutations affect proteins, and cause loss of protein function at the non-permissive temperature. The permissive temperature is one at which the protein typically can fold properly, or remain properly folded. At higher temperatures, the protein is unstable and ceases to function properly. These mutations are usually recessive in diploid organisms. Permissive temperature The permissive temperature is the temperature at which a temperature-sensitive mutant gene product takes on a normal, functional phenotype. When a temperature-sensitive mutant is grown in a permissive condition, the mutated gene product behaves normally (meaning that the phenotype is not observed), even if there is a mutant allele present. This results in the survival of the cell or organism, as if it were a wild type strain. In contrast, the nonpermissive temperature or restrictive temperature is the temperature at which the mutant phenotype is observed.  Use in research  Temperature- sensitive mutants are useful in biological research. They allow the study of essential processes required for the survival of the cell or organism. Mutations to essential genes are generally lethal and hence temperature- sensitive mutants enable researchers to induce the phenotype at the restrictive temperatures and study the effects. The temperature-sensitive phenotype could be expressed during a specific developmental stage to study the effects. = Examples = In the late 1970s, the budding yeast secretory pathway, essential for viability of the cell and for growth of new buds, was dissected using temperature-sensitive mutants, resulting in the identification of twenty-three essential genes. In the 1970s, several temperature-sensitive mutant genes were identified in the fruit fly, such as shibirets, which led to the first genetic dissection of synaptic function. In the 1990s, the heat shock promoter hsp70 was used in temperature-modulated gene expression in the fruit fly.

Essentially, these objects are a pair of a filtered D-module (M, F^\\\\bullet) together with a perverse sheaf \\\\mathcal{F} such that the functor from the Riemann‚ÄìHilbert correspondence sends (M, F^\\\\bullet) to \\\\mathcal{F}. This makes it possible to construct a Hodge structure on intersection cohomology, one of the key problems when the subject was discovered.

This made it possible to give a Hodge structure on an intersection cohomology sheaf, the simple objects in the Abelian category of perverse sheaves.

In addition, there are the following categorical properties # The category of mixed Hodge modules over a point is isomorphic to the category of Mixed hodge structures, \\\\textbf{MHM}(\\\\\\\\{pt\\\\\\\\}) \\\\cong \\\\text{MHS} # Every object M in \\\\textbf{MHM}(X) admits a weight filtration W such that every morphism in \\\\textbf{MHM}(X) preserves the weight filtration strictly, the associated graded objects \\\\text{Gr}_k^W(M) are semi-simple, and in the category of mixed Hodge modules over a point, this corresponds to the weight filtration of a Mixed hodge structure. # There is a dualizing functor \\\\mathbb{D}_X lifting the Verdier dualizing functor in D^b_{cs}(X;\\\\mathbb{Q}) which is an involution on \\\\textbf{MHM}(X). For a morphism f:X \\\\to Y of algebraic varieties, the associated six functors on D^b\\\\textbf{MHM}(X) and D^b\\\\textbf{MHM}(Y) have the following properties # f_!,f^* don't increase the weights of a complex M^\\\\bullet of mixed Hodge modules. # f^!,f_* don't decreate the weights of a complex M^\\\\bullet of mixed Hodge modules. = Relation between derived categories = The derived category of mixed Hodge modules D^b\\\\textbf{MHM}(X) is intimately related to the derived category of constructuctible sheaves D^b_{cs}(X;\\\\mathbb{Q}) \\\\cong D^b(\\\\text{Perv}(X;\\\\mathbb{Q})) equivalent to the derived category of perverse sheaves. This is because of how the rationalization functor is compatible with the cohomology functor H^k of a complex M^\\\\bullet of mixed Hodge modules. When taking the rationalization, there is an isomorphism > \\\\text{rat}_X(H^k(M^\\\\bullet)) = \\\\text{ > }^\\\\mathbf{p}H^k(\\\\text{rat}_X(M^\\\\bullet)) for the middle perversity \\\\mathbb{p}. Notepg 310 this is the function \\\\mathbf{p}:2\\\\mathbb{N} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z} sending \\\\mathbf{p}(2k) = -k, which _differs from the case of pseudomanifolds_ where the perversity is a function \\\\mathbb{p}:[2,n] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z}_{\\\\geq 0} where \\\\mathbf{p}(2k)=\\\\mathbf{p}(2k - 1) = k-1. Recall this is defined as taking the composition of perverse truncations with the shift functor, sopg 341 > \\\\text{ }^\\\\mathbf{p}H^k(\\\\text{rat}_X(M^\\\\bullet)) = \\\\text{ > }^{\\\\mathbf{p}}\\\\tau_{\\\\leq 0}\\\\text{ }^{\\\\mathbf{p}}\\\\tau_{\\\\geq 0} > (\\\\text{rat}_X(M^\\\\bullet)[+k]) This kind of setup is also reflected in the derived push and pull functors f_!,f^*,f^!,f_* and with nearby and vanishing cycles \\\\psi_f, \\\\phi_f, the rationalization functor takes these to their analogous perverse functors on the derived category of perverse sheaves. = Tate modules and cohomology = Here we denote the canonical projection to a point by p:X \\\\to \\\\\\\\{pt\\\\\\\\}. One of the first mixed Hodge modules available is the weight 0 Tate object, denoted \\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_X^{Hdg} which is defined as the pullback of its corresponding object in \\\\mathbb{Q}^{Hdg} \\\\in \\\\textbf{MHM}(\\\\\\\\{pt\\\\\\\\}), so > \\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_X^{Hdg} = p^*\\\\mathbb{Q}^{Hdg} It has weight zero, so \\\\mathbb{Q}^{Hdg} corresponds to the weight 0 Tate object \\\\mathbb{Q}(0) in the category of mixed Hodge structures. This object is useful because it can be used to compute the various cohomologies of X through the six functor formalism and give them a mixed Hodge structure. These can be summarized with the table > \\\\begin{matrix} H^k(X;\\\\mathbb{Q}) &= H^k(\\\\\\\\{pt\\\\\\\\}, p_*p^*\\\\mathbb{Q}^{Hdg}) > \\\\\\\\\\\\ H^k_c(X;\\\\mathbb{Q}) &= H^k(\\\\\\\\{pt\\\\\\\\}, p_!p^*\\\\mathbb{Q}^{Hdg}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ > H_{-k}(X;\\\\mathbb{Q}) &= H^k(\\\\\\\\{pt\\\\\\\\}, p_!p^!\\\\mathbb{Q}^{Hdg}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ > H_{-k}^{BM}(X;\\\\mathbb{Q}) &= H^k(\\\\\\\\{pt\\\\\\\\}, p_!p^*\\\\mathbb{Q}^{Hdg}) > \\\\end{matrix} Moreover, given a closed embedding i: Z \\\\to X there is the local cohomology group > H^k_Z(X;\\\\mathbb{Q}) = H^k(\\\\\\\\{pt\\\\\\\\}, p_*i_*i^!\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_X^{Hdg}) = Variations of Mixed Hodge structures = For a morphism of varieties f:X \\\\to Y the pushforward maps f_*\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}^{Hdg}_X and f_!\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}^{Hdg}_X give degenerating variations of mixed Hodge structures on Y. In order to better understand these variations, the decomposition theorem and intersection cohomology are required. = Intersection cohomology = One of the defining features of the category of mixed Hodge modules is the fact intersection cohomology can be phrased in its language. This makes it possible to use the decomposition theorem for maps f:X \\\\to Y of varieties. To define the intersection complex, let j : U \\\\hookrightarrow X be the open smooth part of a variety X. Then the intersection complex of X can be defined as > IC_X^\\\\bullet\\\\mathbb{Q}^{Hdg} := j_{!*}\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_U^{Hdg}[d_X] where > j_{!*}(\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_U^{Hdg}) = > \\\\operatorname{Image}[j_!(\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_U^{Hdg}) \\\\to > j_*(\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_U^{Hdg})] as with perverse sheavespg 311. In particular, this setup can be used to show the intersection cohomology groups > IH^k(X) = H^k(p_*IC^\\\\bullet\\\\underline{\\\\mathbb{Q}}_X) have a pure weight k Hodge structure.

It is the company's first attempt at a milsim marker, which are popular among scenario paintball players. Mechanically, the SP-8 is very similar to the popular Smart Parts Ion, but the body is modeled after the Heckler & Koch XM8 Assault Rifle. Features on the SP-8 include break beam eyes, high capacity solenoid, electronic double-finger trigger, and military style accessory rails, which can be used to mount sights, tactical lights, bipods, and other accessories. First party after market upgrades include a 7-point collapsible stock, extended suppressed \\"stealth\\" barrel, and multi-mode Blackheart circuit board. Additional third party upgrades are also available. The SP-8 is also available in four color combinations: Jungle (Olive/Black), Desert (Tan/Black), Urban (Gray/Black) and Night Ops (Black). Preproduction SP-8 units shipped in an unmarked carton with a standard Ion manual. Production first-generation SP-8s had their own manual; they shipped with standard Ion grips and a split-tip barrel that (from the front) formed the Smart Parts logo but which was prone to bending if jammed into the ground. Subsequent SP-8s used wraparound grips unique to the SP8 and had a more traditional muzzle- break barrel. SP-8 internals are identical to those of an Ion, with a few minor differences. First, the SP-8's regulator is canted 15 degrees forward; the Ion's is vertical. The SP-8's pressure gauge is mounted on the right, unlike the Ion (and almost all other markers) which has the gauge on the left. The SP-8 ships with a straight \\"blade\\" trigger, while the Ion has a curved \\"wave\\" trigger. Finally, the SP-8's breech section is drilled for a right-hand feed tube (so that top-mounted accessories such as scopes will not be blocked by the feed tube or hopper), while the Ion is set up for traditional vertical feed. The SP-8 is thus forced to use a plastic 45-degree elbow adapter to mount a hopper, which (because it is prone to frequent breakage) is a criticized feature. The Ion, by contrast, has a threaded vertical feed port that accepts all standard Impulse-threaded feednecks. Aftermarket adapters have been released that allow the SP-8 to use the same Impulse-threaded feednecks as the Ion while eliminating the plastic elbow. Due to the market success of the SP-8, Smart Parts released a second milsim marker, the SP-1, in late 2007. The SP-1 is a more basic electronic marker, with a more traditional body, a tension-based anti chop system instead of break beam eyes, and a lighter price tag to appeal to more players.

Such a state is usually accompanied by dissipation. It is either decaying turbulence or requires an external source of energy to sustain it. Examples are waves on a fluid surface excited by winds or ships, and waves in plasma excited by electromagnetic waves etc. Appearance External sources by some resonant mechanism usually excite waves with frequencies and wavelengths in some narrow interval. For example, shaking a container with frequency œâ excites surface waves with frequency œâ/2 (parametric resonance, discovered by Michael Faraday). When wave amplitudes are small ‚Äì which usually means that the wave is far from breaking ‚Äì only those waves exist that are directly excited by an external source. When, however, wave amplitudes are not very small (for surface waves: when the fluid surface is inclined by more than few degrees) waves with different frequencies start to interact. That leads to an excitation of waves with frequencies and wavelengths in wide intervals, not necessarily in resonance with an external source. In experiments with high shaking amplitudes one initially observes waves that are in resonance with one another. Thereafter, both longer and shorter waves appear as a result of wave interaction. The appearance of shorter waves is referred to as a direct cascade while longer waves are part of an inverse cascade of wave turbulence. Statistical wave turbulence and discrete wave turbulence Two generic types of wave turbulence should be distinguished: statistical wave turbulence (SWT) and discrete wave turbulence (DWT). In SWT theory exact and quasi-resonances are omitted, which allows using some statistical assumptions and describing the wave system by kinetic equations and their stationary solutions ‚Äì the approach developed by Vladimir E. Zakharov. These solutions are called Kolmogorov‚ÄìZakharov (KZ) energy spectra and have the form k‚àíŒ±, with k the wavenumber and Œ± a positive constant depending on the specific wave system. The form of KZ-spectra does not depend on the details of initial energy distribution over the wave field or on the initial magnitude of the complete energy in a wave turbulent system. Only the fact the energy is conserved at some inertial interval is important. The subject of DWT, first introduced in , are exact and quasi-resonances. Previous to the two-layer model of wave turbulence, the standard counterpart of SWT were low-dimensioned systems characterized by a small number of modes included. However, DWT is characterized by resonance clustering, and not by the number of modes in particular resonance clusters ‚Äì which can be fairly big. As a result, while SWT is completely described by statistical methods, in DWT both integrable and chaotic dynamics are accounted for. A graphical representation of a resonant cluster of wave components is given by the corresponding NR-diagram (nonlinear resonance diagram). In some wave turbulent systems both discrete and statistical layers of turbulence are observed simultaneously, this wave turbulent regime have been described in and is called mesoscopic. Accordingly, three wave turbulent regimes can be singled out‚Äîkinetic, discrete and mesoscopic described by KZ-spectra, resonance clustering and their coexistence correspondingly. Energetic behavior of kinetic wave turbulent regime is usually described by Feynman-type diagrams (i.e. Wyld's diagrams), while NR-diagrams are suitable for representing finite resonance clusters in discrete regime and energy cascades in mesoscopic regimes.

Retrieved 8 August 2016. Biography=Early years= Mary Turner was 22 years old and had been a schoolteacher for eight years when she married Joseph Cook in 1885. Beginning as a pupil teacher at Chesterton Girls' School, by 1885 she was an assistant mistress. Like Cook, she came from a Staffordshire mining family. She appears to have had a role in helping both her brothers and her husband to overcome their lack of education. At their Lithgow home, Cook studied in the evenings, moving from writing and grammar to typing and shorthand, and then to book- keeping. He began studying to become a Methodist minister. =Emigration= By 1891, six years after their marriage and emigration to Australia, the couple had three small sons, and Joseph Cook had a seat in the New South Wales parliament. By 1901 they had six children, and he had won the Parramatta seat in federal parliament. For the 20 years he sat in the federal parliament, Joseph Cook spent much of his time in Melbourne, where parliament sat. Mary Cook managed their large household in Sydney, with eight children born between 1886 and 1906. Cook became Navy Minister in Billy Hughes' government in 1917. Mary Cook was by then very active in the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Red Cross Society, and in Cook's electorate of Parramatta. From the time of her husband's knighthood in 1918 she became Lady Cook and was styled in that way until seven years later when she was honoured in her own right as a Dame. She spoke at meetings there in the 1919 election campaign, and also deputised at ministerial events, such as the unveiling of an Honour Roll dedicated to the 1914‚Äì18 servicemen and women in General Granville Ryrie's Manly electorate. =London= Cook and her husband some time in the 1920s During her husband's term as High Commissioner, Mary Cook played a key role for the Australian Red Cross Society, including representing the Society at a meeting of the International Red Cross Board of Governors in Paris in 1923. =Honours= Mary Cook's services to Australia were acknowledged when she was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1925. =Retirement= The Cooks returned to Australia in 1927, enjoying an active retirement. In 1928, on the foundation of the Newington College Parents' and Friends' Association, Dame Mary was elected president. In the first year of the association ¬£300 was raised for equipment and improvements to the school's hospital.

Catherine Flon (d. after 1803), was a Haitian seamstress, patriot and national heroine. She is regarded as one of the symbols of the Haitian Revolution and independence. She is celebrated for sewing the first Haitian flag in 1803 and maintains an important place in Haitian memory of the Revolution to this day. Life Catherine Flon was born on an unknown date in Archaie in Saint-Domingue. Her parents traded in textiles from France. She became a seamstress with her own workshop, and hade several apprentices. She was the god daughter of Jean-Jacques Dessalines. = Creation of the flag = According to Haitian revolutionary tradition, Flon created the country's first flag on May 18, 1803, the last day of the Congress of Arcahaie. There, the leader of the Revolution, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Flon's godfather, cut apart a French tricolor with his sabre, demonstrating his desire to break away from France. He gave the pieces to Flon, who stitched them back together, while leaving out the central white strip. In Haitian lore, the colors of the new flag took on a racialized meaning: the blue and red stripes represented a union between the black and mulatto citizens of Haiti. Historians have noted some limitations within this legendary history of the flag's creation. For instance, primary sources from the Revolution reveal that rebels had used blue-and-red flags before the Arcahaie conference. Also, the first Haitians to use the bicolor flag had meant it to represent an extension of French Revolutionary values, rather than a rejection of them; early revolutionaries had fought to preserve the 1794 law of emancipation rather than to gain independence.  In Haitian culture and memory  Catherine Flon is regarded as one of the three most symbolic heroines of the Haitian independence, alongside C√©cile Fatiman and D√©d√©e Bazile. Her birthplace of Arcahaie is today referred to as \\"flag town\\" and the date on which she is said to have made the first flag, May 18, has become a national holiday. Besides serving as a symbol of the Revolution, Flon has also become a figure of admiration among Haitian women. Social events and woman-led activist movements are named after the revolutionary hero. On festivals and national holidays, young women dress as Flon and other female revolutionaries, calling attention to the role of women in the Revolution and in Haitian history as a whole. Her picture was featured on a 10-Gourdes Haitian banknote issued in 2000. References Further reading  * M√©l√©ance, Emide.

Westerfield considered Yale a comparatively quiet place compared with the tensions which were wrenching apart other faculties in the leading American universities of that period;Merelman, p. 94. and his strategy for building consensus encompassed an emphasis on scholarship, academic competition, and professional prestige of the department.Merelman, p. 145. Influential teacher Westerfield was credited by Vice President Dick Cheney with having helped shape Cheney's views on foreign policy during Cheney's days at Yale. Cheney's political views were informed by a course he took from Westerfield, then a self-described ardent hawk who believed the United States should be assertive in its role as the leader of the free world.Carney, James et al. \\"7 Clues To Understanding Dick Cheney,\\" Time. December 30, 2002. However, Westerfield's views were modified over the course of time, and he came to characterize the Bush administration's foreign policy as \\"precisely the wrong approach.\\"Nichols, John. \\"A Little Education Can Be a Dangerous Thing,\\" The Nation. August 26, 2004. Westerfield's legacy as a teacher was more subtly confirmed in a Yale course description prepared for the Spring 2009 semester.

He is the author of a reference book on the origins of the Chinese revolution and has co-edited the book China in the twentieth century. His Peasants without the Party was awarded the Association for Asian Studies Joseph Levenson Book Prize in 2003. Life After attending high school Bianco enrolled in the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and the √âcole nationale des Langues orientales, where he learned Chinese. In 1968 he obtained his degree in history from the University of Paris, where he wrote his thesis on the history of Thailand. He later spent time teaching at Harvard University Princeton University, University of Michigan, Stanford, and in Taiwan and Hongkong. For many years he was director of studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris and taught at the Institut d'√âtudes Politiques de Paris. The release of Bianco's 1967 book \\"Les origines de la r√©volution chinoise 1915-1949\\" proved to be highly influential in Chinese research in France and was translated into numerous languages, including English, German, and Japanese. In the 1960s and 1970s Bianco was an outspoken critic of the government of China, and in particular Mao Zedong and Cultural Revolution. Peter Bernard Harris praised Bianco's stance, stating that \\"Professor Lucien Bianco has boldly asserted his opposition not merely to the Gang of Four but, more particularly, to what he called 'Maologie.'\\" Bianco was also a critic of the 1973 Paris Peace Accord that ended the Vietnam War and joined a group of Asian specialists who protested the agreement because of the treatment of political prisoners by the South Vietnamese government. In 2003, Bianco's book Peasants Without the Party: Grassroots Movements in 20th-Century China won the Joseph Levenson Book Prize. In awarding the prize, the Association for Asian Studies praised Bianco's work as \\"a quarter-century of innovative and careful research about peasant discontent.\\" The committee judged that :arguing that class consciousness and revolutionary activity did not come \\"naturally\\" but that they could certainly be nurtured, Bianco provides a thoroughly documented corrective to earlier narratives of peasant revolution. In doing so, he helps students of the Chinese revolution understand not only the role of the peasant, but also the discourse of peasant revolution that is woven throughout social life. Furthermore, through his constant revision of his earlier ideas and his evenhanded consideration of work by other scholars, Bianco exhibits a fine sensitivity to changes in the researcher‚Äôs intellectual approach over time, as well as to the biases inherent in historical sources.

They have three grown children ‚Äì Ryan, Dana and Clifton ‚Äì and two grandsons. =Legal troubles involving son= In 2005, Clifton, along with two others, were arrested and accused of \\"brooming\\" 18 middle-school aged boys in the buttocks area while they were clothed. Witness reports on the \\"brooming\\" incidents ranged from the use of brooms to touch the boys' rectal areas, to holding one boy down while shoving a broomstick against his buttocks. As part of a plea deal that Clifton accepted in 2006, he was sentenced to spend 30 days in jail, in addition to probation and community service. Despite claims by the parents of some of the victims that the incidents constituted sexual abuse, prosecutors argued instead that the crimes were not sexually motivated, which a trial judge agreed. Parents of some of the victims have criticized the outcome, decrying what they perceive as a lenient sentence and suggesting that a plea deal was done because of Bennett's political status as President of the State Senate. Both Bennett and the prosecutor have denied allegations of political pressure in the case, with Bennett going as far as accusing critics of knowingly making false statements due to what he claims as a lack of evidence on him attempting to sway the case.

It lies west of Dundee on the main A90 road. History A record survives of Sir Patrick Gray, as Baron of Longforgan, holding a baronial court here in 1385 on the Longforgan or Hund Hill; a moot hill. The officials present were the same as those at of the sovereign's courts. The village was created a burgh of barony in 1672. Castle Huntly, established in the 14th century and developed in the 17th and 18th centuries, is located south-west of the village. It is now an open prison. A woodland, Huntly Woods, is situated away from the village. There is evidence that a Roman Camp was built in Huntly woods. St Modwenna, who died in 521, is said to have founded a church at Longforgan. The present church, which probably stands on its site, was practically rebuilt in 1794, but during renovation about 1900, 15th century mouldings were discovered. A probably 13th century cross and a tombstone dated 1400, from the churchyard are preserved in the church. The present church is still in use and no trace of an earlier building can be seen. A restored panel in the tower reads \\"Founded in 1690\\". Two stones bearing incised crosses stand against the wall of the vestibule within the church. The tombstone dated 1400 is fixed to the interior of the north wall of the church. Beneath it is a stone with the following inscription: \\"Found under floor at supposed east end of pre-Reformation church while altering present church 1899\\". This stone bears the full length effigies of a knight in armour, his lady in the costume of the period and a small figure of a youth in armour, either a son or an attendant squire. Around the edge of the stone a ribbon is carried which the following (Latin) inscription is incised in Gothic letters. A translation reads : here lies John de Galychtly, late Laird of Ebrokis. The date for death was not carved and the incised writing is relatively clear indicating the stone may not have been used as a grave marker. The lands of Ebrokis (Ebrukis, Ebrux) appear in the Great Seal Register 1508/9 within the barony of Longforgan. In a letter dated 1650 between Sir Patrick Ogilvie of Inchmartine and Thomas Ogilvie, the lands of Ebrokis are mentioned as 'Ebrux alias Broomhall'. Broomhall is located at the south west corner of Longforgan parish. Two grave slabs, one to James Fife, d.1588 and the other to Jean Fledger, d.1660, have been removed from the graveyard, conserved and are now displayed within the church lobby. William Wallace is said to have stopped here to rest after escaping from Dundee where he had killed the English governor's son. The knocking stone upon which he sat is preserved in the Dundee Museum.Dundee Museum Name The name Longforgan may be derived from Scottish Gaelic lann, meaning \\"enclosure\\" or \\"church\\", or l√≤n, meaning \\"marsh\\", coupled with fothir grund, meaning a fertile field. Its form in modern Scottish Gaelic is Forgrann. Description The mercat cross in the centre of the village Main Street is one of the oldest parts of the village. It contains the oldest cottages in the village and the bowling club, police station, Architects Office, primary school, Coaching Inn, church and general store. The 17th-century mercat cross is protected as a category A listed building. Castle Road is another of the oldest streets in Longforgan, and as the name suggests, was the main road from the church down to Castle Huntly. Many of the houses are original whitewashed cottar houses used in the past by land workers on the estate. This 'bonny' road down to the Carse of Gowrie is now closed to through vehicle traffic. The primary school in the village can accommodate around 100 pupils in total. The Headteacher is Lauren Budd. The Eastbank area was developed in the 1960s, and Paterson was built in the 1970s, to accommodate the village's growing population, it is situated in the north of the village. Dorward Place was re-developed (completion 1997) from an old Farm Site (An Aerial photograph of the original site is hung in the housing complex) and consists only of sheltered servite housing. Westbank was originally farms but was transformed into houses in 2001. Rosamunde Pilcher Drive is located in this estate, and is named after the bestselling author Rosamunde Pilcher who lives in Longforgan. Built in the 2000s, Mary Findlay Drive is the largest modern housing estate in Longforgan with 42 houses and its own park. Worbey Place is situated next to Helen McGregor Park in the east end of Longforgan. The park includes run down tennis courts, a football pitch and a play area. The only church is situated on the Main Street and is run by the Church of Scotland with the minister being the Rev. Dr. Marjory MacLean. Memorial panels to the Paterson family in the church were designed by Robert Lorimer in 1900.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer Drimmie Drimmie was an estate in the west of Longforgan parish.

She put a strong emphasis on research, engaging experts from a lighhouse specialist to the Irish State Pathologist, Prof. Marie Cassidy. Her agent conducted an auction secured a substantial two-book rights deal, and international rights sales quickly followed. As Williams thought at the time that she would continue as a journalist and copywriter, and wanted to keep the two writing careers separate, she devised the pseudonym Alex Barclay, which she felt was \\"the sort of strong name a thriller writer might have.\\" Darkhouse was the first of two novels featuring NYPD detective Joe Lucchesi. The book, set in Texas, New York and County Waterford, achieved strong reviews and was sold to more than ten markets, and translated into 18 languages. It was the top-selling paperback in Ireland for a period. The author continued the practice of writing at least partly in remote locations, including a spell at Anam Cara for each published book. Her second novel, The Caller, also featuring NYPD's Joe Lucchesi, was released in 2007; it was marketed in some territories as Last Call. The author mentioned in a 2007 interview that her fourth book - after a third book featuring an FBI agent - would return to Lucchesi but this did not transpire. However she restated in a 2014 interview that the Lucchesi character would return. The Caller is Barclay's top-selling book to date in the UK / Ireland market. After its publication, Barclay and her agent also secured a publisher contract for three more books. Ren Bryce novels Barclay's first novel about a female agent with a bipolar condition, Ren Bryce, entitled Blood Runs Cold, was published in 2008, and she won the inaugural Crime Fiction Award, sponsored by Ireland AM, at the Irish Book Awards, for this. Bryce works with an imaginary FBI group, the Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force, based in Denver, Colorado. Five more books followed in this series, which has not concluded. The author continued a research-based approach for this series, with visits to the United States, including an invited visit to the FBI regional HQ in Denver. Youth fiction In 2013, Barclay released a novel for young adults, Curse of Kings. It was billed as the first of a series of six, the Trials of Oland Born, though no further titles in this series have been scheduled or published as of 2019, and in a 2016 interview, the author referred to the book in the singular. In July 2019 it was announced that a new book for younger readers was submitted, a diary-form novel, My Heart & Other Breakables: How I lost my mom, found my dad, and made friends with catastrophe, with a hardback publication date of March 2020, this being the first volume in a two-book deal with HarperCollins Children's Books. Standalone novel A new book was announced by HarperCollins in 2019, and was launched on August 2 with an interview and reading at a joint event of the Skibbereen Arts Festival and the West Cork Literary Festival, at Liss Ard. A novel, I Confess is promoted as a psychological thriller, on release August 22 in Ireland and the UK. Events and media Barclay has been on signing tours, as well as participating in literary and other festivals and events, including the Waterford Writers Weekend, and Electric Picnic. Media appearances included an on-air interview on RT√â TV's The Panel. Sales As of July 2019 UK / Ireland sales per Nielsen BookScan (covering most outlets) of Barclay's crime novels had reached nearly 300,000 copies.

It was released in April 2007. It is a triple crossover product, based on an oriental science fantasy RPG Tenra Bansho, steampunk western RPG Terra the Gunslinger, and post-apocalypse mecha RPG Angel Gear. All three of the original games were designed by Jun'ichi Inoue. Concept The setting is based after the intercontinental war between two continents: Tenra (similar to a high-magic Japan in the Sengoku period) and Terra (similar to a United States in the Wild West). After the war, the world was changed by the influence of great culture clash between oriental and occidental nations. The game starts from that point, after the two cultures have had some time to intermingle. That's when the mysterious alien \\"Angels\\" arrive, great psychic/magical creatures with strange and unknowable motives. The basic setup of the game is two radical cultures joining together to fight off an alien invasion. There are over 40 character classes based on oriental and western cultures in basic rulebook, which include houshi (buddhist monk), Jinguuke (Shinto's agent belonging to the Jinguuke clan), ninja, onmyouji, samurai, Yoroi-nori (mecha pilot), gunslinger, preacher and private eye, rocket ranger (member of US Army's special airborne forces), saloon girl and steam mage. To emphasize the cultural mashup, classes are mixable: One could create a ninja gunfighter, a Taoist Sorcerer Catholic priest, a kugutsu (living doll) saloon girl, and so on. Oriental and western characters fight against the angels that are arch-foes of humankind together. The game is using the Standard RPG System, a ruleset also used for Alshard, 'Alshard Gaia and Kaze no Stigma RPG There are variances for character generation, and there are additional extra rules for things like Fate and Asura, the latter meaning, in this context, the possibility of becoming evil.  Differences from source material  The world as imagined in the original Tenra Bansho game (1996‚Äì1997) and the original Terra the Gunslinger game was a huge planet with contained Tenra's \\"Japan\\" to the East, Terra's \\"USA\\" to the West. Tenra originally makes reference to the continent of India to Tenra's East. In Tenra War, this world is reconfigured so that the lands of Tenra are to the \\"South\\", the lands of Terra are to the \\"North\\", and they exist together in one giant Ringworld-like structure.

They concluded \\"the album never strays from its intensity or its creativity\\", and added that Valentyne Suite is similar and just as outstanding, even though Allmusic's official review of that album is largely negative.

History On October 24, 1976 a group called the Omaha Homecoming Planning Committee had their first meeting and a vision of having a reunion of native Omahans that left the city for various reasons. The individuals responsible for setting up the committee and subsequent meetings were founders, Vera Johnson and Bettie McDonald.

Astrophotography Newton took his first astrophotograph when he was 13 years old of the planet Saturn. He invented \\"cold camera\\" astrophotography, allowing for substantially longer exposures on film. In 1991 Newton became the first amateur astrophotographer to make full (RGB) color CCD images of celestial objects using a Santa Barbara Instruments Group ST-4 camera, making a full color CCD image of M57, the \\"Ring Nebula\\" and M27, the \\"Dumbbell Nebula\\". He took three separate black and white images, each taken with a separate filter in red, blue, and green, which were later combined in software that was being developed for amateur astrophotography by Richard Berry, then editor of Astronomy magazine. Berry published the first combined color CCD image of M27 as his magazine's cover. Books Newton has published six books on amateur astronomy and astrophotography. His first book, Astrophotography: From Film to Infinity, was published in 1974. He has had two books published by Cambridge University Press: the Cambridge Deep-Sky Album in 1983, , and the Guide to Amateur Astronomy in 1995, . Awards and recognition He received the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977 for his contributions to science. He is the Honorary Patron of the Cotswold Astronomical Society. In 2005 Carolyn S. Shoemaker and David H. Levy named an asteroid, 30840 Jackalice = 1991 GC2, in honor of Newton's astrophotographic accomplishments and of Jack and Alice Newton's work in astronomy outreach. In 2006 Newton was selected by unanimous vote of the AL council for honorary membership in the Astronomical League, an association of over 200 local amateur astronomy societies promoting astronomy. In 2007 he was elected as Patron of the Cotswold Astronomical Society in England. Newton served on the board of advisors of Meade Instruments' 4M Community Outreach program, which was established to help amateur astronomers. In 2006 Newton was elected by membership of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific to a third term of office on its board of trustees. During an earlier term he led the launch of Project Astro which aims to assist astronomers and teachers in the classroom. Newton was the recipient of the Amateur Achievement Award of Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1988 for his work in astrophotography. This award \\"recognizes significant observational or technological contributions to astronomy or amateur astronomy by an individual not employed in the field of astronomy in a professional capacity\\". Jack has led solar eclipse expeditions to Oaxaca (Mexico), Baker Lake (Northwest Territories, Canada), Bransk (Siberia, California Baja, and Indonesia. He also led a group to Peru to view Halley's Comet. He was a long-time member of the Puckett Observatory World Supernova Search Team, and as of the date of disbandment of the Team in October, 2019 had been credited with one pre- discovery, over 210 discoveries and co-discoveries, and one cataclysmic variable discovery in June 2010. Newton helped establish the astronomy program at Pearson College UWC, to which he donated his 25-inch Newtonian telescope. The Newtons served several terms as honorary patrons of the College. Newton has been Past President of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada's centers in Winnipeg, Toronto, and Victoria, British Columbia. He was elected as a Life Member in 1978. His photos appear on the cover of the 2007 Observer‚Äôs Handbook and in the RASC calendar. The Victoria Center created a \\"Newton/Ball\\" (Jack Newton/George Ball) award which it gives annually as a service award. Current work Newton's photographs and articles appear frequently in Astronomy magazine and his images have appeared in Skynews (Canada) and in Sterne und Weltraum, a journal of the Max Planck Institute in Germany. His solar images appeared in National Geographic's 2004 special edition entitled Exploring Space - the universe in pictures, Time Inc.'s Life - the Year in Pictures (2003 & 2004), and in Sky & Telescopes 2004 Beautiful Universe issue. In 2007 one of his solar images was used for the lead-in to the science section in Life: Platinum Edition Anniversary Collection‚Äî70 Years of Extraordinary Photography.

The banks of bright lights were needed to produce a bright enough image at the receiver. Modern replica of Stooky Bill. Stooky Bill was the name given to the head of a ventriloquist dummy that Scottish television pioneer John Logie Baird used in his 1924 experiments to transmit a televised image between rooms in his laboratory at 22 Frith Street, London. Baird invented some of the first experimental television systems. In 1924 he developed a mechanical television system to transmit moving images by means of electrical signals, which he demonstrated on 25 March 1925 at a London department store, Selfridges. It consisted of a spinning disk set with a spiral pattern of 30 lenses. As each lens rotated past the illuminated subject, it focused the light from a spot on the subject on a selenium photoelectric cell. This converted the brightness of the image at each spot into a proportional electric signal, which could be sent to a receiver by radio waves. As each lens swept past the subject, it scanned a successive line of the image. At the receiver, a light shining through the holes in a similar rotating disk recreated an image of the subject. Due to the low sensitivity of the photoelectric cells, Baird's first system was not able to televise human faces, because they had inadequate contrast. So Baird used a ventriloquist's dummy, whose brightly painted face had greater contrast, and made it move and talk before the scanner. Stooky Bill and another Baird dummy, \\"James\\" have been jokingly called \\"the first television actors\\". \\"Stooky\\" or \\"stookie\\" is Scots for stucco or plaster of Paris, or for a plaster cast used to immobilise bone fractures. The term is also used someone who is slow-witted or awkward in his movements. The incandescent lights illuminating the subject to be televised generated so much heat that Baird couldn't use a human for the testing, so Stooky Bill was used. Eventually the hair became singed and the painted face became cracked by the heat.

Background and education Townshend was the eldest son of George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend, by his first wife Charlotte Compton, 16th Baroness Ferrers of Chartley and 7th Baroness Compton. He was the elder brother of Lord John Townshend and Lord Charles Townshend and the nephew of Charles Townshend. He succeeded to the titles held by his mother on her death in 1774 and became known as the Lord Ferrers of Chartley. He was educated at Eton and St John's College, Cambridge, and served for a few years in the Army, achieving the ranks of Cornet, Lieutenant, and finally Captain in 1774. Political career Townshend received his writ of summons to the House of Lords in 1774. In March 1782 he was appointed Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners, a position he held until May 1783, and again from December 1783 to 1797. He was admitted to the Privy Council in April 1782 and also served as a member of the Committee for Trade from 1784 to 1786. In 1784 he was created Earl of Leicester in his own right. His choice of title derived from the fact that he was a female-line great-great-great-grandson of Lady Lucy Sydney, daughter of Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester (a title which had become extinct in 1743). He later held office under William Pitt the Younger and Henry Addington as Master of the Mint from 1790 to 1794, as Joint Postmaster General from 1794 to 1799 and as Lord Steward of the Household from 1799 to 1802. In 1807 he succeeded his father in the marquessate of Townshend. Apart from his political career, Townshend was interested in archaeology and served as President of the Society of Antiquaries. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Trustee of the British Museum. Family Charlotte, Baroness de Ferrers, later Countess of Leicester, by Richard Cosway Lord Townshend married Charlotte, daughter of Eaton Mainwaring-Ellerker, on 24 December 1777, who had adopted the name and arms of Ellerker by a 1750 Act of Parliament.Deed Poll Office: Private Act of Parliament 1750 (24 Geo. 2). c. 17 They had two sons, George and Lord Charles, both of whom died childless, and three daughters. She died in February 1802. Lord Townshend died suddenly in July 1811, aged 58, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son George, who had previously been disinherited. On the latter's death in 1855 the earldom of Leicester became extinct while the marquessate passed to his cousin John Townshend, son of Lord John Townshend of Balls Park. Titles and styles *The Hon.

Records. The album's last song, \\"Trilogy of Knowledge\\", is split into four separate parts and tells of the life of Jesus Christ. The lyrics recount events from the Bible (often expressed in first person), and include opera vocals, orchestral instruments, acoustic guitars, distorted guitars, and more. Although the album was critically lauded, the band disbanded the following year, but reformed in 2005. Recording The pre-production of Dimensions was recorded at Trauma Studios, and was produced by The Trauma Team and Ted Hermanson who did the engineering, assisted by the drummer Joey Daub. Wyatt Robertson and David Baddorf left Believer before the band began recording Dimensions. Jim Winters joined as bassist and also played some guitar parts during the recording sessions. On this album, Glenn Fischbach played cello, Scott Laird played violins and violas, and Julianne Laird Hoge performed soprano vocals. The album was mastered at The Hit Factory, DMS, New York, by Chris Gehringer. The cover art and illustration was done by Dave McKean. The album was released in 1993 and turned out to be the band's most technical, progressive, and ambitious album. Both Roadrunner Records and R.E.X. Records released it with a different cover art. The lyrics on Dimensions deal with philosophy. For example, on the song \\"Dimentia\\" the lyrics deal with the philosophical paradoxes and the ponderings of Sigmund Freud, Thomas J. J. Altizer, Ludwig Feuerbach and Jean-Paul Sartre about the existence of God. The song specifically quotes Altizer's The Gospel of Christian Atheism, Sartre's Being and Nothingness, Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity, and Freud's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. The symphonic metal suite ‚ÄùTrilogy of Knowledge‚Äù, divided to three chapters and an intro, is an over 20 minute epic and Biblical story about life of Jesus Christ and knowledge of good and evil. ‚ÄùTrilogy of Knowledge‚Äù once again featured the orchestral compositions of Scott Laird and soprano vocals by Julianne Laird Hoge. Reception While some fans preferred Sanity Obscure over Dimensions, the critics considered Dimensions as the album that separated Believer from average thrash metal groups, and praised the album's musical output. Tom MacMillan of The Phantom Tollbooth claims that \\"Believer's last offering to the musical world proved a metal classic\\" and \\"Dimensions is one of the greatest progressive metal albums of all time.\\" Rating the album 5/5, MacMillan writes: Matt Anderson of Cross Rhythms also gave the album a perfect score, concluding that Dimensions was \\"A brilliant album. Only Believer could have dreamt up such an album.\\" AllMusic highlighted the 20-minute \\"Trilogy of Knowledge.\\" Jeff Wagner stated in the book Mean Deviation: Four Decades of Progressive Heavy Metal that \\"as tech metal albums go, it is a masterpiece of frigid guitar tones, warped riffs, and constant tempo changes,\\" and \\"with Dimensions, Believer had borne a dense, challenging monolith of progressive metal that has few equals, even years later.\\" Track listing # \\"Gone\\" (K.

Shimura varieties are not algebraic varieties but are families of algebraic varieties. Shimura curves are the one-dimensional Shimura varieties. Hilbert modular surfaces and Siegel modular varieties are among the best known classes of Shimura varieties. Special instances of Shimura varieties were originally introduced by Goro Shimura in the course of his generalization of the complex multiplication theory. Shimura showed that while initially defined analytically, they are arithmetic objects, in the sense that they admit models defined over a number field, the reflex field of the Shimura variety. In the 1970s, Pierre Deligne created an axiomatic framework for the work of Shimura. In 1979, Robert Langlands remarked that Shimura varieties form a natural realm of examples for which equivalence between motivic and automorphic L-functions postulated in the Langlands program can be tested. Automorphic forms realized in the cohomology of a Shimura variety are more amenable to study than general automorphic forms; in particular, there is a construction attaching Galois representations to them.  Definition = Shimura datum = Let S = ResC/R Gm be the Weil restriction of the multiplicative group from complex numbers to real numbers. It is a real algebraic group, whose group of R-points, S(R), is C* and group of C-points is C*√óC*. A Shimura datum is a pair (G, X) consisting of a reductive algebraic group G defined over the field Q of rational numbers and a G(R)-conjugacy class X of homomorphisms h: S -> GR satisfying the following axioms: * For any h in X, only weights (0,0), (1,‚àí1), (‚àí1,1) may occur in gC, i.e. the complexified Lie algebra of G decomposes into a direct sum :: \\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbb{C}=\\\\mathfrak{k}\\\\oplus\\\\mathfrak{p}^{+}\\\\oplus\\\\mathfrak{p}^{-}, :where for any z ‚àà S, h(z) acts trivially on the first summand and via z/\\\\bar{z} (respectively, \\\\bar{z}/z) on the second (respectively, third) summand. * The adjoint action of h(i) induces a Cartan involution on the adjoint group of GR. * The adjoint group of GR does not admit a factor H defined over Q such that the projection of h on H is trivial. It follows from these axioms that X has a unique structure of a complex manifold (possibly, disconnected) such that for every representation œÅ: GR -> GL(V), the family (V, œÅ ‚ãÖ h) is a holomorphic family of Hodge structures; moreover, it forms a variation of Hodge structure, and X is a finite disjoint union of hermitian symmetric domains. = Shimura variety = Let A∆í be the ring of finite adeles of Q. For any sufficiently small compact open subgroup K of G(A∆í), the double coset space : Sh_K(G,X) = G(\\\\mathbb{Q})\\\\backslash X\\\\times G(\\\\mathbb{A}_f)/K is a finite disjoint union of locally symmetric varieties of the form Œì \\\\ X+, where the plus superscript indicates a connected component. The varieties ShK(G,X) are complex algebraic varieties and they form an inverse system over all sufficiently small compact open subgroups K. This inverse system : (Sh_K(G,X))_K admits a natural right action of G(A∆í). It is called the Shimura variety associated with the Shimura datum (G, X) and denoted Sh(G, X).  History  For special types of hermitian symmetric domains and congruence subgroups Œì, algebraic varieties of the form Œì \\\\ X = ShK(G,X) and their compactifications were introduced in a series of papers of Goro Shimura during the 1960s. Shimura's approach, later presented in his monograph, was largely phenomenological, pursuing the widest generalizations of the reciprocity law formulation of complex multiplication theory. In retrospect, the name \\"Shimura variety\\" was introduced by Deligne, who proceeded to isolate the abstract features that played a role in Shimura's theory. In Deligne's formulation, Shimura varieties are parameter spaces of certain types of Hodge structures. Thus they form a natural higher-dimensional generalization of modular curves viewed as moduli spaces of elliptic curves with level structure. In many cases, the moduli problems to which Shimura varieties are solutions have been likewise identified.  Examples  Let F be a totally real number field and D a quaternion division algebra over F. The multiplicative group D√ó gives rise to a canonical Shimura variety. Its dimension d is the number of infinite places over which D splits. In particular, if d = 1 (for example, if F = Q and D ‚äó R ‚âÖ M2(R)), fixing a sufficiently small arithmetic subgroup of D√ó, one gets a Shimura curve, and curves arising from this construction are already compact (i.e. projective). Some examples of Shimura curves with explicitly known equations are given by the Hurwitz curves of low genus: * Klein quartic (genus 3) * Macbeath surface (genus 7) * First Hurwitz triplet (genus 14) and by the Fermat curve of degree 7.Elkies, section 4.4 (pp. 94‚Äì97) in . Other examples of Shimura varieties include Picard modular surfaces and Hilbert modular surfaces, also known as Hilbert‚ÄìBlumenthal varieties.  Canonical models and special points  Each Shimura variety can be defined over a canonical number field E called the reflex field. This important result due to Shimura shows that Shimura varieties, which a priori are only complex manifolds, have an algebraic field of definition and, therefore, arithmetical significance. It forms the starting point in his formulation of the reciprocity law, where an important role is played by certain arithmetically defined special points. The qualitative nature of the Zariski closure of sets of special points on a Shimura variety is described by the Andr√©‚ÄìOort conjecture. Conditional results have been obtained on this conjecture, assuming a Generalized Riemann Hypothesis.http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~klingler/papiers/KY12.pdf  Role in the Langlands program  Shimura varieties play an outstanding role in the Langlands program. The prototypical theorem, the Eichler‚ÄìShimura congruence relation, implies that the Hasse‚ÄìWeil zeta function of a modular curve is a product of L-functions associated to explicitly determined modular forms of weight 2. Indeed, it was in the process of generalization of this theorem that Goro Shimura introduced his varieties and proved his reciprocity law. Zeta functions of Shimura varieties associated with the group GL2 over other number fields and its inner forms (i.e. multiplicative groups of quaternion algebras) were studied by Eichler, Shimura, Kuga, Sato, and Ihara. On the basis of their results, Robert Langlands made a prediction that the Hasse-Weil zeta function of any algebraic variety W defined over a number field would be a product of positive and negative powers of automorphic L-functions, i.e. it should arise from a collection of automorphic representations. However philosophically natural it may be to expect such a description, statements of this type have only been proved when W is a Shimura variety.Qualification: many examples are known, and the sense in which they all \\"come from\\" Shimura varieties is a somewhat abstract one.

It was proposed in an op-ed article Al Gore wrote in a \\"My Turn\\" column for Newsweek in 2006. Like the internet, which widely distributed information, the Electranet would allow homeowners and small businesses to operate small generating power facilities and contribute to local and regional energy needs by selling power into the grid at a rate that is determined by free market forces. Like the internet, which led to a surge of productivity, the Electranet's distributed generation model is hoped to lead to innovative power generation through alternative sources and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Electranet advocates predict that as more people participate in the Electranet, the cost of electricity will continue to go down until it becomes free. In a 2006 speech to NYU, Al Gore advocated deploying an Electranet as one way to reduce global warming, as well as reduce the cost of energy, by dropping the barriers to entry for average citizens to actively participate in the business of harnessing and distributing power. Al Gore frequently notes that \\"a lot of energy is all around us. Instead of having the sun bake us in the summer, why not gather that energy\\", he asks. \\"Why not collect from road surfaces, roofs, any painted surfaces and more?\\" Al Gore has also said that \\"once there is a convenient way to sell energy into the grid, not only will homeowners be compelled to hop onto the grid and supply energy, but there will also be a brand new market to develop and then sell all sorts of energy gathering devices and technologies, such as solar paint, solar fabrics, thin films for windows, micro windmills, and more.\\" Al Gore mentioned the Electranet idea in his congressional Global Warming Testimony on March 21, 2007. Electranet advocates predict that just like data on the internet, energy itself, including what is necessary for electric cars, will continue to be more economical as more people get onto the smart grid and supply power, and as more and more efficient technologies are developed for gathering the abundant energy around us. It is reasonable to imagine a day when there is no actual cost for driving, per mile, for energy, because of the abundance of energy coming from the Electranet.

The school is part of the educational provision of the Diocese of Southwark and the London Borough of Croydon.  History  Saint Andrew's school was opened in the summer of 1861 by Reverend Fitzroy John Fitzwygram, inititally in rented rooms behind St Andrew's Church in Lower Coombe Street and next to the Surrey Cricketers public house. His intention was to provide education for the working class. By December of the following year permanent building for boys and girls, as well as an infants schools were opened in Southbridge Road. However, the Whitgift school foundation opened a Whitgift Poor School for boys nearby, which later became known as Trinity School of John Whitgift, and in the summer of 1864 the boys school closed owing to lack of numbers. The girls' school expanded into the vacated buildings. In 1893 the Whitgift Poor School changed its focus, and became an aspirational school for the middle classes. Funding was therefore sought to re-open the Saint Andrew's boys school. At the same time, inspectors found the other buildings to be too small and so the whole school was rebuilt. =Reverend Fitzroy John Fitzwygram= Map from 1895 showing original site of St Andrew's School, Croydon. The Reverend Fitzroy John Fitzwygram ran the parish of St Andrew's, Croydon, for about 18 months during the absence of the first vicar, Rev. H. R. Reynolds. He was born in 1827 the fourth son to Sir R. F. Fitzwygram, baronet of Leigh Park.. One of his brothers became a military General and an MP. The family were wealthy and had always taken a benevolent interest in their local community. Fitzwygram may have been generous with his wealth but he most certainly did not believe in ‚Äòhand-outs‚Äô for the poor. His strategy was much more to ‚Äòempower‚Äô them. Seeing the needs of the parish of St Andrew's, within a month of arriving in Croydon in mid-1861 he had hired a temporary schoolroom and raised over half of the ¬£110 (about ¬£5000 in today's money) needed to convert the room and set it up as a school. Most of this money was either his own, or from close family members. News of his project was reported as the first piece of Croydon News in the very first issue of the Croydon Times, established on 29 June 1861. His intention was to set up a school for the ‚Äòmiddle classes‚Äô i.e. a ‚Äòmiddle‚Äô school for which families would pay a few pence a week for their children to attend. This would be self- supporting financially, and eventually be capable of also housing an ‚ÄòIndustrial School‚Äô for the working classes. They would still have to pay but at a much lower rate. The idea was that the poor received a good education, but at a rate that they could afford. This was in direct contrast to the local Ragged School which was funded by charitable donations and provided a form of free education and often food and clothing to the poorest children. However, the poor quality of education at the Ragged School was a cause of much controversy in the Croydon Times, the local paper, leading eventually to an editorial. The insistence that even the poor had to pay some thing was most definitely not because Fitzwygram did not care about the poor, but rather that he wanted to show them how to work their way out of poverty. For example, to help the poorest in Croydon - those labourers who maybe only had work during the summer months - he set up a ‚Äòcoal club‚Äô so that families could pay during the summer months for the sacks of coal they would need during the winter months. He was a regular visitor at the school, spending at least two hours there every Monday morning. He campaigned enthusiastically in the local press for funds to complete the building of the purpose-built schools and by Nov 1861 a site had been secured between Old Town and Church Road, very close to the Church. Within a year, the schools were completed and formally opened at the beginning of Dec 1862. Just one month later, the Revd Fitzwygram suddenly left Croydon and Rev. H. R. Reynolds, the incumbent, or ‚Äòofficial‚Äô Vicar, returned to take up his post once more. The circumstances surrounding Revd Fitzwygram's departure are not clear, but reports in the local papers indicate that the return of the vicar was an unsettled time for the parish. However, the school was very important to Revd Fitzwygram and the staff and pupils were obviously fond of him. He returned to visit the pupils a couple of weeks later when special gifts of a salver and a silver lead pencil were presented to him and words of appreciation said. The event concluded with the children being allowed home early! =Early Years= St Andrew's Church. The original rented school rooms were behind the building in the background The girls‚Äô and infants‚Äô school got off to a very successful start. It was led by a twenty-one year old called Fanny Thornton who, although young, would have already completed a five-year apprenticeship as a pupil monitor before completing two years' training to qualify her to teach. She was assisted by two of her younger sisters. The girls‚Äô and infants‚Äô school opened with 31 pupils but, within four months, numbers had risen to 80. Because schooling for girls was not compulsory until after 1871, there were probably fewer schools for girls in Croydon. At St Andrew's, there were four classes all taught in one room at the same time. The boys‚Äô school opened with 23 pupils and numbers were never as high as in the girls‚Äô school. This was probably due to the fact that there were more schools for boys in Croydon competing with St Andrew's. Just next door but one, in Church Street, was the Whitgift Poor School which went on to become Trinity School. The head of St Andrew's boys‚Äô school was also a twenty- one year old. His name was Frederic Le Huquet and he came from Guernsey. Croydon Old Town in those days was not a healthy place to live. It was damp in the valley and the housing was often squalid and insanitary with the poor drainage. Smallpox was a common disease amongst the pupils. Mr Le Huquet wrote in the school log-book in 1863 that he had a ‚Äôfear of contagion‚Äô. This proved sadly prophetic for within ten months of taking up his post as head master of the new St Andrew's school for boys, he died from smallpox. =20th Century= In 1927 the school was reorganised as a single school for the first time. Enrolment increased and education was provided from infants to age 11 in a single school. Within five years the school had to be rebuilt and enlarged to accommodate the numbers, and the offering was extended up to age 14. The Archbishop of Canterbury opened the new school on 28 April 1934. At the time Croydon was still part of the diocese of Canterbury. Schooling was reorganised in 1951. Primary education was removed from Saint Andrew's and provided in nearby church Primary Schools. Saint Andrew's was then converted to become a Secondary Modern School. In 1964 the Croydon Flyover was constructed, necessitating the demolition of the school, so once again a new building was constructed, this time on Warrington Road on Duppas Hill, the current location. The school changed status in 1978 from a Secondary modern to a voluntary aided comprehensive school, with a joint entry with Archbishop Tenison's School. =21st Century= The school achieved specialist status for Music in 2006, However the Specialist Schools Programme was dismantled in 2010. In recent years the enrollment at the school has fallen below the published level of 695, with the school no longer offering places to years 7‚Äì9. This has impacted on funding and recruitment. Authorities have been looking at the possibility of merger and considering the closure of the school in August 2020. As of September 2020, the St. Andrews site is serving as the temporary site of Coombe Wood School. Headteacher Kerry Target joined the school in September 2015 and then in 2019 OFSTED reported the school's effectiveness was inadequate.https://files.api.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/50066465 A previous OFSTED report had cited the effective measures that the school has in place to support teaching and learning and continue to raise outcomes. In July 2018 mere weeks before the end of term, it was announced that all year 8 and 9 students at St Andrew's would need to find new school places for September and that no new Year 7 students would be admitted. Jonathan Harris, formerly Headteacher at an underperforming secondary school in North Lincolnshire, Thomas Middlecott Academy, took the helm to close the school. As of the start of the 2019‚Äì2020 school year, there were 241 students enrolled in the school. Enrichment The school's enrichment activities have resulted in increased opportunities for its students, effective outreach with its feeder primary schools and improved student leadership by 2010. The school has established a theatre company to help students stage regular showcases, including cultural celebrations and concerts. Through its relationship with the British Theatre Academy, the school has seen its pupils perform in the West End in the Colour Purple. The programme of enrichment and outreach with feeder primary schools sees St Andrew's students leading workshops at feeder primary schools, becoming teachers for the day. The school's STEM programme aims to provide students with a unique STEM focus across the curriculum. As part of this, St Andrew's hosted a ‚ÄòScience in Action‚Äô workshop for hundreds of primary school pupils, led by the school's expert science team. The programme gives primary school pupils the opportunity to get hands on with science. Computing is also featured, with primary school pupils creating a one-player computer game. = School Crest = The idea of the St Andrew's crest comes from the Scottish national flag. But has now been changed to another unique logo showing a shield with the white saltire cross of St Andrew on a blue (specifically heraldic azure) ground. The cross pierces a red five- leafed open coronet. On the under side of the shield is the Latin school motto: per crucem ad coronam. = Sister School = The annual admissions procedure was shared with St Andrew's sister school, Archbishop Tenison's, from 1978 until 2018. When the decision was taken to close St Andrew's, the governors of Archbishop Tenison's were offered the opportunity to expand into the St Andrew's school site. The governor's voted not to do so. = Houses = Students joining the school are assigned to one of five Houses. The school operates a vertical pastoral system: students are placed into a tutor group on joining the school and remain in the same group until the end of Year 10, at which point they move to one of five groups specifically designated for Year 11 students in order that they can be given specific guidance in relation to their GCSE examinations. The House system is being discontinued in September 2016 by the new Headteacher. Each house at St Andrew's takes its name from a British cathedral, and has a distinct house colour: * Durham * Salisbury * York * Lincoln * Wells References Category:Secondary schools in the London Borough of Croydon Category:Church of England secondary schools in the Diocese of Southwark Category:Voluntary aided schools in London ","title":"St Andrew's Church of England High School"},{"id":"10389930","text":"Dame Helena Shovelton, DBE, FRSA, Hon.

The first CSAC physics package was demonstrated at NIST in 2003, based on an invention made in 2001. The work was funded by the US Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) with the goal of developing a microchip-sized atomic clock for use in portable equipment. In military equipment it is expected to provide improved location and battlespace situational awareness for dismounted soldiers when the global positioning system is not available, but many civilian applications are also envisioned. Commercial manufacturing of these atomic clocks began in 2011. The CSAC, the world's smallest atomic clock, is 4 x 3.5 x 1 cm (1.5 x 1.4 x 0.4 inches) in size, weighs 35 grams, consumes only 115 mW of power, and can keep time to within 100 microseconds per day after several years of operation. A more stable design based on the vibration of rubidium atoms was demonstrated by NIST in 2019. The new design has yet to be commercialized. How it works Like other caesium atomic clocks, the clock keeps time by a precise 9.192631770 GHz microwave signal emitted by electron spin transitions between two hyperfine energy levels in atoms of caesium-133. A feedback mechanism keeps a quartz crystal oscillator on the chip locked to this frequency, which is divided down by digital counters to give 10 MHz and 1 Hz clock signals provided to output pins. On the chip, liquid metal caesium in a tiny 2 mm capsule, fabricated using silicon micromachining techniques, is heated to vaporize the alkali metal. A semiconductor laser shines a beam of infrared light modulated by the microwave oscillator through the capsule onto a photodetector. When the oscillator is at the precise frequency of the transition, the optical absorption of the caesium atoms is reduced, increasing the output of the photodetector. The output of the photodetector is used as feedback in a frequency locked loop circuit to keep the oscillator at the correct frequency. Development Conventional vapor cell atomic clocks are about the size of a deck of cards, consume about 10 W of electrical power and cost about $3,000. Shrinking these to the size of a semiconductor chip required extensive development and several breakthroughs. An important part of development was designing the device so it could be manufactured using standard semiconductor fabrication techniques where possible, to keep its cost low enough that it could become a mass market device. Conventional caesium clocks use a glass tube containing caesium, which are challenging to make smaller than 1 cm. In the CSAC, MEMS techniques were used to create a caesium capsule only 2 cubic millimeters in size. The light source in conventional atomic clocks is a rubidium atomic-vapor discharge lamp, which was bulky and consumed large amounts of power. In the CSAC this was replaced by an infrared vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) fabricated on the chip, with its beam radiating upward into the caesium capsule above it. Another advance was the elimination of the microwave cavity used in conventional clocks, whose size, equal to a wavelength of the microwave frequency, about 3 cm, formed the fundamental lower limit to the size of the clock. The cavity was made unnecessary by the use of a quantum technique, coherent population trapping. Commercialization At least one company, Microsemi, produces a version of the clock.

Premiering on NBC on September 14, 2009, the program aired on weeknights at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT through February 9, 2010. The program was modeled upon the format of a late night talk show‚Äîspecifically, Jay Leno's incarnation of The Tonight Show, opening with a comedic monologue, followed by interviews with celebrity guests and other comedy segments. Sketches from The Tonight Show (including Headlines and Jaywalking) were carried over to The Jay Leno Show, along with new sketches. The program was the result of a compromise by NBC Universal's then-CEO Jeff Zucker to keep Jay Leno with the company following his retirement from The Tonight Show and replacement with Conan O'Brien. The Jay Leno Show was also intended to provide NBC with an alternative to the high-cost scripted dramas aired by competing networks in its time slot; the network believed that the lower cost of production, in combination with product placement deals, meant that the program did not necessarily have to be highly viewed in order to turn a profit. NBC hoped to attract Leno's existing fans, as well as a larger primetime audience than that of his late-night program. The Jay Leno Show was met with mixed reception from critics, who felt that the series had little differentiation from Leno's Tonight Show. Others were critical of NBC's decision to give up an hour of its weeknight lineup to Leno, due to the network's past success with dramas airing in the time slot, while one NBC affiliate (WHDH in Boston owned by Sunbeam Television, now independent) notably planned not to air the show at all, although this decision was retracted due to complaints by the network. Although viewership of The Jay Leno Show was initially on par with NBC's projections, by November, the program's ratings began to fall significantly. NBC's affiliates complained that the declining viewership of The Jay Leno Show also had a ripple effect on the viewership of their late local newscasts. In an effort to address the concerns, NBC announced in January 2010 that it would, following the 2010 Winter Olympics, shorten The Jay Leno Show to a half-hour, and move it to 11:35 p.m‚Äîthe timeslot that had been occupied by The Tonight Show for nearly 60 years, and bump Tonight to 12:05 a.m. The decision resulted in a major public conflict between the network and Conan O'Brien, who asserted that the move would damage the highly respected Tonight Show franchise, and that he would not participate in the program if it were moved to 12:05. Despite much support for O'Brien from both the publicNew York Times article: \\"On the Web, a Wave of Support for Conan O'Brien\\". and media professionalsTwitter post by Roger Ebert: \\"I agree: A touching statement from Conan.\\" alike, NBC maintained its plan to move Leno to 11:35. On January 21, 2010, NBC reached a $45 million settlement with O'Brien in order to end his contract. The Jay Leno Show ended on February 9, 2010, after being on the air for only four months, with Entertainment Weekly calling the program television's \\"Biggest Bomb of All Time.\\"The Jay Leno Show Was TV's \\"Biggest Bomb Ever\\", USA Today, January 21, 2010 Leno resumed his duties as host of The Tonight Show on March 1, 2010, for his second and final stint that lasted until his February 2014 succession by Jimmy Fallon. History NBC announced in 2004 that Jay Leno would leave The Tonight Show in 2009, with Conan O'Brien as his replacement. Leno‚Äîwho wanted to avoid an acrimonious transition like what he experienced when he inherited Tonight from Johnny Carson‚Äîsaid at the announcement, \\"You can do these things until they carry you out on a stretcher, or you can get out when you‚Äôre still doing good.\\" He began to regret his decision to retire in 2007, and several networks and studios including ABC, Fox, Sony, and TribunePursell, Chris and Jon Lafayette. \\"Tribune Plans Safety Net for Stations \\" TV Week, 2008-06-15. expressed interest in his services after leaving Tonight. Jeff Zucker, President and CEO of NBC Universal (2007‚Äì2011). Jeff Zucker, then-President and CEO of NBCUniversal, sought to keep Leno from defecting to a competitor. Leno rejected several NBC offers for broadcast network daytime slots or subscription TV slots, a series of recurring specials, and a half-hour show at 8 pm five nights a week featuring Leno's Tonight monologue. The network had in 1981 considered moving The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson to 10 pm; Zucker, who in 2007 offered Oprah Winfrey an hour five nights a week at 8 pm,Lafayette, Jon. \\"NBC Went to Oprah Before Leno for Prime Time \\" TV Week, 2009-05-19. now offered Leno an hour five nights a week at 10 pm.Hirschberg, Lynn. \\"Heeeeere's . . . Conan\\" The New York Times Magazine, 2009-05-20. Leno was announced on December 9, 2008. At least one station, then-affiliate WHDH- TV in Boston, Massachusetts, stated that it would not carry the program, claiming that Leno would be detrimental to the station's 11 pm news and that it would instead launch a local news program in the time slot. NBC said that such plans would amount to a flagrant violation of the network contract‚Äîa claim which WHDH disputed‚Äîand said that it would immediately remove its programming from WHDH if the station followed through with the plan. WHDH backed down on April 13, 2009, and announced that it would air Leno instead of the proposed program. Though Leno was the first to move the entire five-day-a- week late night talk show to prime time, he was not the first Tonight alumnus to move from late night to a prime time talk show. Steve Allen hosted Tonight Starring Steve Allen from 1954 to 1957; while still hosting that show, he began hosting the prime-time The Steve Allen Show in 1956 on NBC, and the latter show would run until 1960. Jack Paar, who hosted Tonight from 1957 to 1962, next hosted a weekly talk show known as The Jack Paar Program that ran until 1965, also on NBC.\\"Paar, Jack\\". The Museum of Broadcast Communications. In January 2010, several news outlets reported that The Jay Leno Show would be shortened to 30 minutes and begin airing weeknights at 11:35 pm ET, with Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon's shows following it beginning at 12:05 am. The scheduling change would have been implemented on February 28 after the 2010 Winter Olympics (which preempted much of NBC's primetime and late-night lineup). Leno himself commented on the rumors during his January 7 monologue, joking that NBC stands for \\"Never Believe your Contract.\\"Los Angeles Times article: \\"Jay Leno may regain 'Tonight Show' perch (Updated)\\" According to Broadcasting & Cable, \\"most [NBC affiliates] are hopeful Jay‚Äîand Conan‚Äîsticks with NBC, and most, if not all, desperately want to see a change in terms of the lead-in they're getting to their lucrative late news; the affiliates \\"remain fiercely loyal to Leno and were quick to say the rookie program's struggles don't reflect the funnyman's work ethic or comedic chops. 'This isn't about Jay's popularity,' says WJAR Providence VP/General Manager Lisa Churchville. 'This is about having that kind of show at 10 p.m.'\\" NBC announced plans to move Leno to 11:35 pm and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien to 12:05 am. O'Brien refused to participate in the move and, on January 21, 2010, reached an agreement with NBC allowing him to leave the network.After Failed Leno Experiment, a Redefining Moment at NBC, USA Today, January 11, 2010 Leno's final episode aired on February 9, 2010NBC Sets February 9 Date for \\"The Jay Leno Show\\" , Inside TV, January 26, 2010 and Leno returned to Tonight as host on March 1, 2010.

Two to three times each week, celebrities drove an electric Ford Focus and tried to set records on a 1,100-foot dedicated outdoor track.

One planned segment, \\"Stories Not Good Enough for the NBC Nightly News\\" (which would have featured then-NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams), was dropped from the show before it made it to air. In addition to reserving comedy segments for the end, the network aired no commercials after the show and \\"urged local affiliates to do the same\\" so local news could start immediately, retaining as many Leno viewers as possible. =Recurring segments= * \\"Headlines\\" (Monday): Humorous print items sent in by viewers.

Leno asks people questions about current news and other topics in public areas around Los Angeles (usually Hollywood Boulevard, Melrose Avenue or Universal Studios). Most responses are outrageously incorrect; for example, one person believed that Abraham Lincoln was the first president, and another could not identify a picture of Hillary Clinton. Sometimes the questions are of the \\"What color is the White House?\\" level, such as asking in what country the Panama Canal is located. Up to 15 people are interviewed in an hour or less for each segment, with about nine interviews used on the air.The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, 2009-05-29.

NBC reportedly had an option to cancel after two years, but had committed to at least one or two years regardless of ratings, although later chose to end the show after less than five months.

While Leno was not necessarily expected to be competitive with the higher-rated scripted shows on ABC and CBS in its time slot, its projected cost of production was far lower and thus it was expected to be profitable to the network, and product integration intended to make the show \\"as DVR-proof as you can be on television in this era\\". Each airing of Leno cost about $350,000 to $400,000 versus up to $3 million for an hour-long drama, saving NBC $13 million each week without the network needing the show to beat its competitors. Those costs include the services of 22 writers,Littleton, Cynthia. \\"Leno saving the best for last\\" Variety, 2009-08-19. whom Leno called the \\"top 5% of the highest-paid . . . in the Guild.\\" McDonald's became the first buying advertiser for the program, tying in their \\"Million Dollar Roll\\" nightly in October 2009 promoting that year's version of McDonald's Monopoly. =Ratings= Leno did not expect his show to beat competing first-run episodes, but to do better than reruns, in part because topical jokes benefit from the \\"immediacy\\" of the time slot versus 11:30 pm. A television analyst predicted that Leno would finish in \\"a safe third place\\" every night. NBC research before the show's debut indicated that fans of Leno would watch Leno two to three times a week.

NBC told Leno that at a 1.5 rating, NBC makes $300 million a year. Tonight at 11:30 pm earned about a 1.3 to 1.5; the television audience at 10 pm is 40% larger than at 11:30 pm, and the network hoped Leno's audience would also grow.Mitovich, Matt. \\"Leno Will Bring Life to Death-Happy 10 O'Clock Hour, Says NBC\\" TV Guide, 2009-05-04.

By comparison, 2.5 is generally necessary for a 10 pm drama to succeed; those that earned a 1.7 or less during the 2008‚Äì2009 season were generally cancelled. NBC's prime-time dramas averaged about 2 during 2008‚Äì2009. The first episode of The Jay Leno Show earned \\"fast national\\" estimates of 17.7 million viewers, an 11 Nielsen rating (5.1 among persons 18‚Äì49) and an 18 share, significantly above both his Tonight finale and the debut of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in all categories.TV ratings: 'The Jay Leno Show' debuts to 17 million-plus .

Though the show itself had been meeting the network's projections, it was severely detrimental to the ratings of the late local news on NBC affiliates. As originally feared by WHDH in Boston, several stations across the country saw what was known as the \\"Leno Effect\\", where the lower audience for Leno (as compared to NBC's scripted prime time offerings) translated directly into a domino effect of severe audience drops for late local news (on the order of 25‚Äì30%) and completely stunted NBC's past successful schedule hammocking strategies,Pergament, Alan (November 17, 2009).

More recently, the upstart MyNetwork TV had attempted, upon its launch in 2006, to air the same telenovelas every night of the week, a programming strategy that proved to be very unsuccessful. NBC's executives called the decision \\"a transformational moment in the history of broadcasting\\" and \\"in effect, launching five shows.\\"Stelter, Brian. \\"NBC Builds Anticipation for 10 P.M.\\" The New York Times, 2009-08-04.

Although NBC had not developed a new hit show at 10 pm in years, industry executives criticized the network for abandoning a history of airing quality dramas at that hour such as Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, and ER, which made NBC \\"the gold standard for sophisticated programming . . . the No. 1 network for affluent and well- educated young viewers\\" during the 1980s and 1990s. In addition, critics predicted that the decision would hurt NBC by undermining a reputation built on successful scripted shows. Other networks believed NBC's decision created an opportunity, and planned their 2009‚Äì2010 schedules accordingly. For example, the show competed with The Mentalist, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, and Numb3rs, four of television's most popular series, on CBS (the first of those four series was moved to 10:00 PM to directly compete with Leno's show, and significantly improved the ratings for that timeslot compared to its predecessor).Pierce, Scott D. \\"CBS can hardly wait for Leno to return\\" Deseret News, 2009-08-04.

The January 29, 2010 issue of Entertainment Weekly listed the show at the top of a list of the 50 Biggest Bombs in television history. The comment made by the network executives about \\"launching five shows\\" was ultimately transformed into the joke that its removal was like \\"cancelling five shows.\\" TV Guide similarly listed the show as the biggest blunder in television history in its November 1, 2010 edition. Boycott by competing networks Rival networks ABC and CBS had discouraged \\"their stars\\" from appearing on The Jay Leno Show in its primetime slot. Julia Louis-Dreyfus (The New Adventures of Old Christine) was the first CBS actor to appear on the show, on September 29, 2009; on that episode, she said \\"there was a little pressure, because as you know you are now on prime time\\", but that \\"Obviously, I committed to doing your show and we‚Äôre friends\\". This boycott did not affect The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien nor was it industry-wide. Other TV networks, like Fox, The CW, and HBO, were more encouraging. Hugh Laurie from the Fox TV show House was a guest on the September 25, 2009, telecast. House is produced by Universal Media Studios, a sister company to NBC through NBC Universal, and Fox does not offer any network programming in the 10 p.m. time slots, instead allowing most of its affiliates to go to local news. In a Broadcasting & Cable interview published in early November 2009, Leno mentioned the boycott again, saying \\"I'm flattered; like ABC and CBS...none of their stars can appear on the show. What are you so afraid of if we're doing so terrible? It's all part of the game.\\" Labor union impact John Wells, the president of the Writers Guild of America, West, and executive producer of prominent NBC shows ER and The West Wing, said, \\"I wish NBC and Jay Leno well; personally, he's a very nice guy, but I hope he falls flat on his face and we get five dramas back.\\" Website dispute In 2004, Guadalupe Zambrano, a Texas real estate agent, registered the domain name thejaylenoshow.com to redirect to his real estate business. After the Leno announcement, Leno accused Zambrano of cybersquatting. Zambrano contended that he had owned the domain for five years, well before the announcement, thus precluding recovery. The UDRP proceedings ruled in favor of Leno, however, stating that Zambrano profited from the value of the Jay Leno trademark in bad faith.http://rightofpublicity.com/thejaylenoshowcom-belongs-to-jay-leno-after- udrp-ruling-in-leno‚Äôs-favor International broadcasting * In Australia, The Comedy Channel on Pay TV aired the show on a same-day turn around Weeknights at 7.30pm AEST.
