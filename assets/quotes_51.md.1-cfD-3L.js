Early life and service Hartney graduated from University of Toronto in 1911 and worked in his brother's law office in Saskatoon. After earning a graduate degree at the University of Saskatchewan, he became a barrister. He joined the Saskatoon Fusiliers, and played cornet in the town band. He married in 1914, just prior to World War I's start. On 28 October 1914, Hartney enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force. His Attestation Paper, filled out for his entry at Saskatoon, gives his height as 5 feet 9¬Ω inches, his complexion as fair, and hair and eyes as brown. His next of kin is given as Irene McCeary Hartney, care of Russell Hartney. Harold Hartney claimed three years prior service as a lieutenant in the Harbord Cadets and as a trumpeter bandsman in the 48th Highlanders.Retrieved on 6 August 2010. After he shipped out to England with the 28th Battalion C.E.F.in May 1915, he visited an aerodrome at Folkestone while training nearby on Dibgate Plains and crossed paths with fellow Canadian Billy Bishop. That incidental meeting at Folkestone Aerodrome steered Hartney to the Royal Flying Corps. On 21 October 1915, he transferred to the RFC. Flying service By the beginning of the Somme Offensive, Hartney had been assigned to 20 Squadron as a Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2d pilot.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/usa/hartney.php Retrieved on 6 August 2010. On 1 July 1916, while flying over the developing ground attack, Hartney found himself under fire from a Fokker E.III. Hartney smacked his gunner alert, sideslipped from danger, and racked his Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2d into an Immelmann turn. He came out slightly above the German, who was now in a head-on firing pass. Hartney's gunner fired five four-round bursts. Hartney's recollection was, \\"His tank ablaze, he pulled up almost directly in front of us, then whip-stalled to Eternity.\\" Despite the flames, Hartney was credited with an \\"out of control\\" victory. On the way home, Hartney and his gunner got into eleven more skirmishes, clearing three incidental machine gun jams. In one skirmish, they tailed another German and sent him down in a smoking plunge to earth for what was officially another \\"out of control\\" win. By the time the FE.2d landed, the gunner had run one gun dry; the other was jammed. The plane was a bullet-riddled wreck, trailing torn fabric. Seven bullets stuck in the engine's water jacket bled off its coolant, and the engine \\"froze\\", with four of its Rolls-Royce pistons sticking to their cylinder walls. Tattered streamers of fabric torn by bullets trailed from the biplane. Somehow, the crew was uninjured. Hartney would not score again until 20 October. He then took leave before returning to the fray as 'A' Flight Commander. On 2 February, flying his ninth assigned aircraft in eight months duty, Hartney destroyed a Halberstadt D.II over Lille. Twelve days later, Hartney was tasked with a photographic reconnaissance mission near Passchendaele. With observer W. T. Jourdan aboard, and escorted by another FE.2, Hartney found himself under attack by seven German Albatros D.III fighter planes. Then, as Hartney later wrote, \\"...the right rear enemy ship...took a swoop at us. His tracer bullets were playing about us for fully two seconds before Jourdan finally let him have both guns right in the face. The poor brave kid just kept on going, for all the world like a mortally wounded bird plummeting to his death near a river bend below us.\\" This victory was Hartney's fifth, making him an ace. The FE.2 escort's observer also downed an Albatros, while Jourdan accounted for another; one German fell aflame, the other fell in a slow spinning dive. The escort then broke up under fire from a single Albatros; the British observer was killed in action, and the pilot wounded. Hartney attempted to battle the attacker, only to discover that his own FE.2 suffered from a snapped-off propeller blade and broken flying wires and was incapable of fighting. The Canadian ace had to shut down the engine and dead-stick to a crashlanding in a Belgian field picketed with hop poles. After impact, he found himself lying under the 775 pounds of the FE.2's engine. Australian troops trying to lift it free dropped it back on him. Hartney eventually was hospitalized beside his observer. By one source they were victims of Paul Str√§hle of Jasta 18, who had scored the first of his 14 victories. Another source credits Baron Manfred von Richthofen with the shoot- down., p. 228. After recuperating, Hartney was transferred to the U.S. Air Service. How and why this happened is somewhat unclear. He had been sent to Gosport by the RFC to command a flight. On September 21, 1917 - almost immediately after arriving at Gosport - Hartney received a telegram ordering him to \\". . . REPORT TO COLONEL ROSCOE AT TORONTO, CANADA, TO COMMAND 27TH AMERICAN AERO SQUADRON WITH RANK FROM THIS DATE OF MAJOR, SIGNAL CORPS, UNITED STATES ARMY.\\" Hartney later described this order as \\"a bolt from the blue\\", that \\"nearly bowled me over\\" and that was \\"unexpected.\\" At this point, he was not even a U.S. citizen. After Hartney reached Canada and reported to Colonel Roscoe in Toronto in late-October, inquiries were made of Washington and Hartney was promptly assured that he in fact had been granted U.S. citizenship; at least one authority agrees that Hartney did receive American citizenship in October 1917, but another reports that Hartney did not become a U.S. citizenship until 1923.Colonel Stanley M. Ulanoff USAR (Editor), in \\"Introduction to New Edition\\" of Earlier, he (like some other RFC pilots) had signed a card stating that he was willing to go to the U.S. to instruct American fliers. Other than this, Hartney did not recall anything that may have been responsible for his sudden and unexpected, but (to him) exciting, transfer to the U.S. Air Service. He scored his last win for them on 25 June 1918, while in the 27th Pursuit Squadron, although he went on to an unconfirmed triumph over a Gotha while with the 185th Aero Squadron. Hartney commanded both the 27th Pursuit Squadron and its parent organization, the 1st Pursuit Group. Harold Hartney ended the war as a Lieutenant colonel in the Air Service, leading to some confusion as to his nationality. He resigned from the Air Service in 1921 but maintained his rank as a Reserve officer.Flying Magazine, October 1941, p. 36 Postwar Hartney was awarded the American Distinguished Service Cross in 1919; ironically, the award citation did not mention his aerial victories. Instead, he was cited for a photo reconnaissance mission on 13 August 1918. He became a member of the bar of the District of Columbia and was a practicing attorney there for several years before becoming a journalist. In 1937, Colonel Hartley served on the board investigating the destruction of the airship Hindenburg.Who Destroyed the Hindenburg by A.A. Hoehling, page 126 Hartney also wrote his memoirs. This work was originally published in 1940, under the title of Up and At 'Em, by Stackpole Sons (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania). Since then, other editions too have been commercially published.See for example: A British edition was published in 1974 by Bailey Bros. & Swinfen Ltd., under the title of Wings Over France.

It is a brick building in the Gothic Revival architectural style with a tall wooden steeple built in the 1870s, one of Ossining's most prominent landmarks. In 1973 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Sixteen years later, in 1989, it was included as a contributing property to the Downtown Ossining Historic District when it was listed on the Register. First Baptist, begun in late 18th-century prayer meetings, is the oldest religious congregation in Ossining. Founder Elijah Hunter, who also established Ossining, began holding regular prayer meetings at his house in 1786. In the church's early years, masters and slaves held equal standing as congregants. The church was later instrumental in helping establish black churches in the area. Building The church lot takes up most of the triangular block at the crossroads where Ossining was first established, between Main Street on the northwest, Church Street on the southwest, and South Highland Avenue (U.S. Route 9) on the east. Ellis Place is directly opposite the church. The block is just south of the intersection with Croton Avenue (New York State Route 133). On the northern tip of the triangle is a former bank building. The opposite side of Main Street is lined with a row of two-story 19th-century brick commercial buildings. Just west of the church, as the terrain slopes gently toward the Hudson River, the trail following the Old Croton Aqueduct, a National Historic Landmark, crosses Main. Across Church is a large parking lot between two larger commercial buildings. Ossining High School is a short distance to the southeast on the east side of South Highland. Immediately opposite the church are houses south of Ellis and another house of worship, Trinity Episcopal Church, on the north corner. Exterior A low cast iron fence surrounds the lot, shaded on the east side by tall mature trees. The building itself is a one-and-a-half‚Äìstory T-shaped brick structure on a stone foundation. Its steeply pitched gabled roofs are shingled in slate and pierced by four similarly gabled dormer windows on either side. On the east corner of the south (front) elevation is a tall steeple with the main entrance. The west elevation has a shed-roofed wing. That facade has a large five-part lancet arched stained glass window springing from a stone belt course. In its upper woodwork are quatrefoils, the church exterior's principal motif, surmounted by segmented limestone. Two fluted wooden colonettes rising from corbels on either side support an intricate vergeboard with more quatrefoils amid it. It hides the exposed hammerbeam trusses of the roof's structural system. A smaller two-part window at the front of the west wing has a similar treatment to the main window, with a smaller quatrefoil. Just around the corner is a gabled side entrance with projecting roof supported by side brackets and a large quatrefoil in the transom. The four small tripartite arched stained glass windows along the facade to the north are separated by buttresses. At their north another steep gabled projection with quatrefoil and vergeboards shelters a taller, narrow tripartite arched window. At the very end is a smaller, narrower window with corresponding quatrefoil. On the east, a fifth window is located at the south end; otherwise, its fenestration is identical. The roof dormers, on both sides, have vergeboards that form quatrefoils. Both ends of the rear section are centered around large blind lancet arches with crosses. Below the west window are three narrow windows set in the same wood as the arch; the east side has two arched double-hung windows beneath the blind arch with a third such window to the north and a single-paned diamond-glass window to the south. A vergeboard pattern echoes the arch on the west end; the east end has no vergeboards but a row of corbeled bricks paralleling the roofline. On the north facade the central section projects slightly. It has a window similar to its counterpart upfront, without the flanking colonettes. Above it are the exposed trusses, without any vergeboards. The two sections on the rear of the cross-section have narrow windows in their exposed basement and a single tripartite lancet-arched stained-glass window in the second story. =Steeple= The first of the steeple's four stages has corner buttresses and two stone belt courses, the upper one serving as the springline for the quatrefoiled transom over the main entrance on the south side. Another course, slightly flared, marks the beginning of the next stage, with a narrow lancet window in the center of each side. Each has diamond glass and some vergeboard in the arch. Above each window is the beginning of a square wooden central column that divides the two louvered lancet-arched vents on each face, now done in painted galvanized sheet iron rather than brick. Midway up each corner, smaller square columns begin. All rise through the cornice that tops the third stage, where they end in pyramids topped by nested pyramids, the corners higher than the central columns, all echoing the steeple's peaked roof. At its top is a small Celtic cross. Interior A heavy wooden double door in a limestone-topped lancet arch leads into the sanctuary. It leads to an interior with extensive and ornate carved woodwork in Gothic motifs set amid plaster walls. A wide central aisle divides the box pews, their aisle ends topped with a trefoil motif. Two narrower aisles run through the side sections from either entrance. The floor is carpeted. The intricate stained- glass windows depict Biblical scenes of importance to the church's evangelical beliefs. Round wooden columns, corniced midway up, support the ceiling's exposed trusses. Narrower columns support the balcony in the rear, and the three-faceted balcony with the church's pipe organ over the altar, raised five feet () off the floor. Atop it is an white marble baptistry. The rooms in the basement are used for Sunday school classes, meetings and office space. History Elijah Hunter, a captain in the Revolutionary War who founded Ossining, started holding Baptist prayer meetings at his house in 1786. This grew rapidly, and four years later, 33 congregants formally incorporated the church. They continued to meet in homes until Hunter donated the land for a small meeting house on the present site in 1815. During the early years, slaves and their masters attended services. Both were considered full members of the congregation, and treated equally in the church. The original building was altered in 1834, and again in 1850. Originally the church had no facility for baptisms, so those took place in a small cove on the Hudson River just south of where the village's train station is now. In 1865 the present white marble baptistry was installed. By that time the church was beginning to outgrow its original structure, and the congregation began considering a new one. Brooklyn architect J. Walsh's Gothic Revival design, with triangles and quatrefoils representing the Trinity and the four Gospels respectively, was dedicated in 1874. It had cost $75,000 ($ in modern dollars) for local contractor John Hoff to build. The church was able to finance it purely from donations from the congregation, without taking out a mortgage. Later in the 19th century the church continued its early tradition of support for the local African-American community. At its centennial celebrations in 1890, an itinerant African-American minister requested the church's help in establishing a 'black' Baptist Church in the village. First Baptist and its congregation responded, and Star of Bethlehem Baptist Church was established on South Spring Street. It continues to hold services today. In 1916 the church was wired for electricity. Almost a century later, after its 200th anniversary celebrations, the church and donors were able to restore all the original stained glass windows. There have been no significant alterations to the building other than those. The church today Ossining First Baptist follows a traditional Baptist creed. \\"The Bible is the inspired and only infallible Word of God and our rule and guide for Faith, Life and Doctrine\\", its website says. This includes a belief in the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, and salvation through \\"repentance and faith in the blood of Christ alone\\". The church holds adult Sunday school and junior church for children every Sunday, with Communion held on the first Sunday of every month. Services are televised on cable channels in the Ossining area, with streaming video available over the Internet at telemissions.com. During the rest of the week men's and women's fellowship sessions are held along with Bible study groups. The church also operates a thrift shop. Two Spanish-language services are held every week to serve the area's growing Latin immigrant population.

She played in South Africa's first four Test matches, scoring 240 runs including a top-score of 96 not out in the first Test against England. She was particularly strong playing the square cut. Career Born to James William, Eileen Hurly attended the Dominican Convent in Benoni. During her first league match in 1947, aged only 13, she hit the first recorded century in women's cricket in South Africa. She made her provincial debut for Southern Transvaal later that year. She continued to set records, and in 1953/54, she made the first recorded inter- provincial century, scoring 106 not out. During the English tour of South Africa, Hurly was South Africa's most prolific run-scorer, consistently out- scoring her teammates. In each of the first three Tests of the series she top- scored for South Africa in the first-innings., posting scores of 37 and 29 after narrowly missing out on a century in the opening match. In 1968/69 South Africa were due to play England again, but at the last minute the English were unable to fulfil the fixtures and a Dutch women's cricket team toured South Africa instead. Hurly was named captain of the South African squad for this tour, which South Africa whitewashed. During this series, Hurly was involved in a 124 run partnership with Jennifer Gove made in under an hour. By the end of her playing career, Hurly had made over 100 appearances provincially, served on the Transvaal executive committee and the South African and Rhodesian Women‚Äôs Cricket Association.

Description The book explains the entire Catholic tradition on the interior life as well as spiritual life covering virtually all aspects of the faith. Composed of 95 chapters, it is a synthesis of Garrigou Lagrange's earlier works, Christian Perfection and Contemplation (Perfection chr√©tienne et contemplation (1923)) and Love of God and the Cross of Jesus (L'amour de Dieu et la Croix de J√©sus (1929)). It is widely regarded as a classic of modern theological literature. In the book he propounded the thesis that infused contemplation and the resulting mystical life are in the normal way of holiness of Christian perfection. This influenced the section entitled \\"Chapter V: The Universal Call to Holiness in the Church\\" in the Second Vatican Council's Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, Lumen gentium.

During her time in office, she began rebuilding the Academy (now Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College) and sent Sisters of Providence to staff military hospitals in Indianapolis and Vincennes, Indiana during the American Civil War. She was born Eleanor Cecilia Kinzie Bailly in Mackinac County, Michigan, on June 2, 1815. Her father was Joseph Aubert de Gasp√© Bailly de Messein, a Canadian fur magnate of French descent, and her mother was Marie Le F√®vre de la Vigne (Tou-se-qua), a member of the Ottawa tribe. When Eleanor was seven, the family moved to the Joseph Bailly Homestead, Porter County, Indiana. This homestead was much traveled by various Native American tribes, including the Menominee, Winnebago, Fox and Dakota Sioux. A priest named John Guegeuen celebrated Mass at this homestead and directed Eleanor to the Sisters of Providence. Eleanor entered the community on November 25, 1841, at which time she became known as Sister Mary Cecilia. In 1843 she was selected to accompany Mother Theodore on a fundraising trip to France. The pair left Saint Mary-of-the-Woods on April 26, 1843, and sailed to France, where they spent time with the Sisters of Providence of Ruill√©-sur- Loir. The sisters there, who expected a \\"savage,\\" were impressed by Bailly's education and fluent French. Guerin and Bailly also met with dignitaries including Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies, Queen of France. Upon returning, Bailly spent time teaching at the Academy, now Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, and took full administrative charge of the institute in 1848. As Superior General Bailly became Superior General of the Sisters of Providence in 1856 upon the death of Mother Theodore, earning the title of Mother Mary Cecilia. During her administration, she sent Sisters of Providence to staff schools in many Indiana towns including Washington, New Albany, Cannelton, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Loogootee, Vincennes and Lafayette. In 1858, Mother Mary Cecilia secured the services of Diedrich A. Bohlen, an architect from Indianapolis, to construct a new building for the Academy and several other buildings the congregation needed, including a bakehouse and a greenhouse. A small, temporary chapel was also built to fill the Sisters' needs until a more permanent and majestic structure could be built. (The Church of the Immaculate Conception, this later, permanent structure, was not consecrated until 1907.) By May 1861, Indiana was mired in the American Civil War and the wounded troops were in need of care. Indiana governor Oliver Morton called upon Mother Mary Cecilia to provide Sisters of Providence as nurses. On May 17, 1861, the Sisters took over administrative duties at Military Hospital in Indianapolis. The Sisters were in charge of washing, cooking and cleaning, and several Sisters served as nurses. The Sisters of Providence are now honored by a monument in Washington, D.C., dedicated to the Nuns of the Battlefield of the Civil War. Mother Mary Cecilia became known for her decisiveness and firm leadership, which drew some Sisters to her and caused others to look upon her unfavorably. In the congregation's elections of 1868, Mother Mary Cecilia did not receive dispensation to continue as Superior General and Sister Anastasie Brown was named instead. This situation was seen as an insult to Mother Mary Cecilia and caused controversy within the community, some of whom viewed Brown, now known as Mother Anastasie, to be a usurper. For some time, there was talk of creating a new branch of the Sisters of Providence, with Mother Mary Cecilia in charge, on the old Bailly Homestead Porter County, Indiana. However, with the 1874 election of a new Superior General, Mother Mary Ephrem Glenn, these plans ceased and the community returned to a mostly united group. In 1880, Mother Mary Cecilia went to serve at St. Ann's Orphanage in Terre Haute, Indiana. She remained there, caring for the orphans, as well as writing a biography of Saint Mother Theodore Guerin, which was left unfinished at her death in 1898. Legacy Bailly is buried in the Sisters of Providence Convent Cemetery at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods.

The eyes of many animals contains a lens that focuses the light of its surroundings onto the retina of the eye. This lens is essential to producing clear images within the eye. However, some individuals may have problems with focus, such as myopia or presbyopia. In this case, the focus of the eyes can be corrected with an external lens, such as glasses or contact lenses, or through surgery. Visual perception Visual perception is the ability to interpret information and surroundings from visible light reaching the eye. The resulting perception is also known as eyesight, sight or vision. The various physiological components involved in vision are referred to collectively as the visual system, and are the focus of much research in psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience and molecular biology. Human Visual system The visual system in humans allows individuals to assimilate information from the environment. The act of seeing starts when the lens of the eye focuses an image of its surroundings onto a light-sensitive membrane in the back of the eye, called the retina. The retina converts patterns of light into neuronal signals. The lens of the eye focuses light on the photoreceptive cells of the retina, which detect the photons of light and respond by producing neural impulses. These signals are processed in a hierarchical fashion by different parts of the brain, from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus, to the primary and secondary visual cortex of the brain. Signals from the retina can also travel directly from the retina to the Superior colliculus. Human eye The human eye is an organ which reacts to light for several purposes. As a conscious sense organ, the eye allows vision. Rod and cone cells in the retina allow conscious light perception and vision including color differentiation and the perception of depth. The human eye can distinguish about 10 million colors. The human eye's non-image-forming photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina receive the light signals which affect adjustment of the size of the pupil, regulation and suppression of the hormone melatonin and entrainment of the body clock. Visual acuity Visual acuity is acuteness or clearness of vision, especially form vision, which is dependent on the sharpness of the retinal focus within the eye and the sensitivity of the interpretative faculty of the brain.Cline D; Hofstetter HW; Griffin JR. Dictionary of Visual Science. 4th ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston 1997. Saturday, 24 August 2019 Visual acuity is a quantitative measure of the ability to identify black symbols on a white background at a standardized distance as the size of the symbols is varied. It is the most common clinical measurement of visual function. In the term \\"20/20 vision\\" the numerator refers to the distance in feet from which a person can reliably distinguish a pair of objects. The denominator is the distance from which an 'average' person would be able to distinguish ‚Äîthe distance at which their separation angle is 1 arc minute. The metric equivalent is 6/6 vision where the distance is 6 meters. The 20/x number does not directly relate to the eyeglass prescription required to correct vision; rather an eye exam seeks to find the prescription that will provide at least 20/20 vision. Non-Surgical Visual Correction Corrective lens A corrective lens is a lens worn in front of the eye, mainly used to treat myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia. The goal is to bring vision up to 20/20 vision or as close to this as possible. Glasses or \\"spectacles\\" are corrective lenses worn on the face a short distance in front of the eye. Contact lenses are worn directly on the surface of the eye. Intraocular lenses are surgically implanted most commonly after cataract removal, but recently for purely refractive purposes. Myopia (short sightedness) requires a divergent lens, whereas hyperopia (far sightedness) requires convergent lens. =Prescription of corrective lenses= Corrective lenses are typically prescribed by an optometrist. The prescription consists of all the specifications necessary to make the lens. Prescriptions typically include the power specifications of each lens (for each eye). Strengths are generally prescribed in quarter-diopter steps (0.25 D) because most people cannot generally distinguish between smaller increments (ex. eighth-diopter steps / 0.125 D). =Glasses= Glasses (also called eyeglasses or spectacles) are frames bearing lenses worn in front of the eyes, normally for vision correction, eye protection, or for protection from UV rays. Modern glasses are typically supported by pads on the bridge of the nose and by temple arms placed over the ears. Historical types include the pince- nez, monocle, lorgnette, and scissors-glasses. Eyeglass lenses are commonly made from plastic, including CR-39 and polycarbonate. These materials reduce the danger of breakage and weigh less than glass lenses. Some plastics also have more advantageous optical properties than glass, such as better transmission of visible light and greater absorption of ultraviolet light. Some plastics have a greater index of refraction than most types of glass; this is useful in the making of corrective lenses shaped to correct various vision abnormalities such as myopia, allowing thinner lenses for a given prescription. =Contact lenses= A contact lens (also known simply as a contact) is a corrective, cosmetic, or therapeutic lens usually placed on the cornea of the eye. Modern soft contact lenses were invented by the Czech chemist Otto Wichterle and his assistant Drahoslav L√≠m, who also invented the first gel used for their production. Contact lenses usually serve the same corrective purpose as glasses, but are lightweight and virtually invisible-- many commercial lenses are tinted a faint blue to make them more visible when immersed in cleaning and storage solutions. Some cosmetic lenses are deliberately colored to alter the appearance of the eye. Lenses now have a slight bluish tint which is a thin UV coating; this reduces glare and cornea damage much like a pair of sunglasses. Surgical Vision Correction Photorefractive keratectomy Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and Laser- Assisted Sub-Epithelial Keratectomy (or Laser Epithelial Keratomileusis\\"Laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK)\\" Accessed June 30, 2008.) (LASEK) are laser eye surgery procedures intended to correct a person's vision, reducing dependency on glasses or contact lenses. The first LASEK procedure was performed at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in 1996 by ophthalmologist, refractive surgeon, Dimitri Azar.\\"Evolution, techniques, clinical outcomes, and pathophysiology of LASEK: review of the literature\\" Accessed October 6, 2007. The procedure was later popularized by Camellin, who coined the term LASEK for laser epithelial keratomileusis. LASEK and PRK permanently change the shape of the anterior central cornea using an excimer laser to ablate (remove by vaporization) a small amount of tissue from the corneal stroma at the front of the eye, just under the corneal epithelium. The outer layer of the cornea is removed prior to the ablation. A computer system tracks the patient's eye position 60 to 4,000 times per second, depending on the brand of laser used, redirecting laser pulses for precise placement. Most modern lasers will automatically center on the patient's visual axis and will pause if the eye moves out of range and then resume ablating at that point after the patient's eye is re-centered. Cataract Surgery Insertion of an intraocular lens for the treatment of cataracts is the most commonly performed eye surgical procedure. The procedure can be done under local anesthesia with the patient awake throughout the operation. The use of a flexible [intraocular lens] enables the lens to be rolled for insertion into the capsule through a very small incision, thus avoiding the need for stitches, and this procedure usually takes less than 30 minutes in the hands of an experienced ophthalmologist. After surgery, patients should avoid strenuous exercise or anything else that significantly increases blood pressure. They should also visit their ophthalmologists regularly for several months so as to monitor the implants. Most intraocular lenses fitted today are fixed monofocal lenses matched to distance vision. However, other types are available, such as multifocal IOLs which provide the patient with multiple-focused vision at far and reading distance, and adaptive IOLs which provide the patient with limited visual accommodation.

They are covered in cilia which help in movement and feeding.Paramecium can reproduce sexually, asexually, or by the process of endomixis. Paramecium aurelia demonstrate a strong ‚Äúsex reaction‚Äù whereby groups of individuals will cluster together, and emerge in conjugant pairs. This pairing can last up to 12 hours, during which the micronucleus of each organism will be exchanged. In Paramecium aurelia, a cryptic species complex was discovered by observation.Sonneborn, T. M. (1975) The Paramecium-aurelia complex of 14 sibling species. Transactions of American Microscope Society, 94: 155‚Äì178. Since then, some have tried to decode this complex using genetic data. Physical characteristics \\"The hair-like cilia that cover the outer body of the paramecium are in constant motion, helping the organism move along at a speed of four times its own length per second. As it moves forward, it rotates on its axis, which aids in pushing food into the gullet. It can move backwards by reversing the motion of the cilia. Food enters the food vacuoles, which cilia push into the gullet in a process known as phagocytosis, and is digested with the aid of hydrochloric acid and enzymes (Raven and Johnson 1996). When digestion is complete, the remaining food content is emptied into pellicles, known as cytoproct. Osmoregulation is carried out by a pair of contractile vacuoles on either end of the cell, which actively expel water absorbed by osmosis from the surroundings.

Paramecia are attracted by acidic conditions, since they eat bacteria, which often acidify their surroundings. They are an important link in the detrital food web in aquatic ecosystems, eating bacteria and dead organic matter often associated with these bacteria, and being preyed on by protists and small animals.

He was head basketball coach at the University of Connecticut for nine seasons, from 1977 to 1986, compiling a 139‚Äì114 record, leading teams to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament and the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). He coached former George Washington head coach Karl Hobbs in college and recruited Rutgers Head Coach, Steve Pikiell to UConn. Before becoming head coach at UConn, he was head coach at St. Paul Catholic High School in Bristol, Connecticut, then assistant coach at UConn under Dee Rowe. He was followed at UConn by Jim Calhoun. After UConn, he worked in business and as a broadcaster before being hired by GW in 1997. As a player for Wilbur Cross High School in New Haven, CT, Perno led his team to 49 consecutive wins and the New England Intercollegiate Basketball Tournament championship played at the Boston Garden. He was named to All-State in 1958-59 and considered attending Boston College and Fairfield University but committed to the University of Connecticut and Coach Hugh Greer. Perno was a Guard for the Huskies from 1960-64 when the university participated in the Yankee Conference, which Connecticut won multiple times. In 1964 Perno led his team to an appearance in the NCAA Tournament where he stole the ball from Princeton‚Äôs Bill Bradley in the final seconds of the game to advance the Huskies to the Tournament‚Äôs Final Eight. Following graduation, Perno coached at South Catholic High School, Hartford, Connecticut and then at St. Paul Catholic High School in Bristol Connecticut where in addition to coaching boys basketball he was also the athletic director, dean of boys and baseball coach. The late Jim Valvano convinced him to interview for the top assistant position at UConn that was becoming available due to Valvano‚Äôs new head coaching job at Bucknell University. Perno took over for Valvano as top assistant to Donald ‚ÄòDee‚Äô Rowe, and after five years, took over as the head coach. Perno was instrumental in elevating the Husky program with the inception of the Big East Conference. Following Perno‚Äôs retirement from coaching he served as Vice President for Sales and Marketing at the Dumont Group in Bristol, CT and as a color analyst for the Big East Network. In 1997 he accepted the Associate Athletic Director position for Development at The George Washington University in Washington, DC. He retired in 2011. Playing career Perno went to Wilbur Cross High School in New Haven and played at UConn from 1960 to 1964. On March 14, 1964 UConn upset Princeton and star forward Bill Bradley, 52‚Äì50, in the Sweet 16 at Cameron Indoor Stadium. The victory was sealed when Perno stole the ball from Bradley with 19 seconds to play. Personal life Perno and his wife, Cindy, reside in Carolina Beach, North Carolina.

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Sudan. Sudan was governed by the United Kingdom and Egypt from 1898. Independence was proclaimed on January 1, 1956. Early Post The first post offices to be opened in Sudan were in 1867 at Suakin and Wadi Halfa; in 1873 at Dongola, Berber and Khartoum; and in 1877 at Sennar, Karkouk, Fazoglu, Elkedaref, El Obeid, Al-Fasher and Fashoda (now Kodok).Gisburn, Harold G. D. & Thompson, G. Seymour, Stamps and Posts of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Stanley Gibbons, 1947, p. 18 The Mahdist revolt, which began in 1881, resulted in all Egyptian post offices being closed by 1884. It culminated in the fall of Khartoum and the death of the British governor General Gordon (Gordon of Khartoum) in 1885. The Egyptians and British withdrew their forces from Sudan and the country was left with no postal service until the reconquest of Sudan began in 1896. When the campaign started in March 1896, postal service was made available to the troops but no stamps were used.Sudan's First Stamps Until the issue of Sudan stamps in 1897 the available stamps were Egyptian stamps. The amount of mail was small and only a few stamps were used. Between March and July 1885 2¬Ωd and 5d British postage stamps were used in Suakin.

Biography He was the only son of Lieutenant-General Sir David Henderson, who served as Director-General of Military Aeronautics 1914‚Äì17, and as General Officer Commanding, Royal Flying Corps 1914‚Äì15, and his wife Dame Henrietta Caroline (n√©e Dundas). Henderson graduated from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, on 13 January 1915, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Princess Louise's (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) regiment. He was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, and was appointed a flying officer on 21 August 1915. He was promoted to lieutenant in his regiment on 21 January 1916, but had to wait until 1 June before receiving the same from the RFC. On 1 July he was appointed a flight commander with the acting rank of captain. Henderson was assigned to No. 19 Squadron, flying the B.E.12, gaining his first two victories in August, and was subsequently awarded the Military Cross, which was gazetted in October 1916. His citation read: :2nd Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) Ian Henry David Henderson, Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders. ::For conspicuous gallantry and skill on several occasions. He drove down a machine out of control, and two days later dispersed six enemy machines which were attacking his formation. A few days later again he brought down an enemy biplane, the observer being apparently killed. A week after this he attacked and drove down another machine which had wounded his leader. He has also carried out several excellent contact patrols and attacked retiring artillery and a kite balloon. Henderson had to wait until November for his third victory, gained while flying a SPAD S.VII. In 1917 he was posted to No. 56 Squadron, flying the S.E.5a, where in July, he shot down four Albatros D.Vs. He was appointed to the General Staff as a 3rd Grade Officer, remaining there until March 1918, when he was re-appointed a flight commander with the acting rank of captain. However, on 21 June 1918, he and Harold Redler were killed in a flying accident, when their Airco DH.9 crashed at Turnberry. He is buried at Doune Cemetery, Girvan, Ayrshire.

NRCAT's founding principles state that: \\"Torture violates the basic dignity of the human person that all religions, in their highest ideals, hold dear. It degrades everyone involved -- policy-makers, perpetrators and victims. It contradicts our nation's most cherished ideals. Any policies that permit torture and inhumane treatment are shocking and morally intolerable.\\" NRCAT's mission statement says that the organization \\"mobilizes people of faith to end torture in U.S. policy, practice, and culture.\\" History NRCAT was created in January 2006 at the conference, ‚ÄúTheology, International Law and Torture: A Conference on Human Rights and Religious Commitment.‚Äù Dr. George Hunsinger of Princeton Theological Seminary convened the conference to better equip the multiple religious communities in the United States to take a more prominent role in the effort to end U.S.-sponsored torture. 150 leaders of a variety of faiths attended the Conference. From January 2006 to May 2007, NRCAT was a project of the Churches‚Äô Center for Theology and Public Policy, a national ecumenical research center located at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, DC. In May 2007, NRCAT became an independent organization and hired Rev. Richard L. Killmer as Executive Director, who served in the position until December 2013. Rev. Ron Stief began as Executive Director in January 2014. In December 2007, the NRCAT Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) entity, was created. The Action Fund is responsible for lobbying and election campaign activities around the issue of U.S.-sponsored torture.http://nrcataf.nonprofitsoapbox.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=35&Itemid;=64 In 2008, NRCAT worked urging presidential candidates, Members of Congress, the President-elect and the President himself to issue an executive order halting torture. On January 22, 2009 President Obama issued Executive Order 13491 titled \\"Ensuring Lawful Interrogations,‚Äù which halted U.S.-sponsored torture. Organization NRCAT has over 300 religious organizations as members. These include: Evangelical Christians, Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, mainline Protestants, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Hindus, Bah√° º√≠, and Buddhists. Member organizations include national denominational and faith group bodies, regional entities such as state ecumenical agencies, and local religious organizations and congregations. Over 75,000 people of faith have endorsed one or more of NRCAT's statements or participated in its activities. NRCAT sends information about current NRCAT programs, developments in the U.S. Congress and state legislatures, and study materials, worship materials and other programs that can be used by people of faith to work to end torture. Current initiatives Ending U.S.-sponsored torture of post-9/11 detainees forever From its founding, NRCAT has played a significant role in working to stop U.S. torture of detainees in order to obtain information and to ensure that the country will never engage in torture again. For example, in 2008 and 2009, NRCAT joined with Evangelicals for Human Rights (now the New Evangelical Partnership) and the Center for Victims of Torture to generate support for an executive order to be issued by the President of the United States that would halt U.S. sponsored torture. NRCAT's efforts proved fruitful when President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order halting torture on January 22, 2009 that adopted many of the coalition's suggestions. To permanently end U.S.-sponsored torture of detainees and seek accountability for past use of torture, NRCAT is asking the U.S. Department of Justice to read the Senate Intelligence Committee's Torture Report and re-open the criminal investigation into torture, working on gathering support for the McCain-Feinstein amendment to the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act that codifies the Executive Order banning torture into law, and working on closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, one of the steps needed to end U.S. sponsored torture forever.http://www.nrcat.org/storage/documents/statement-on-force- feeding-071813.pdf Additionally, NRCAT works on increasing the number of people in the U.S. who believe that torture is always wrong- without exceptions. Ending torture in U.S. prisons, especially the use of prolonged solitary confinement In solitary confinement, prisoners are held alone or with another person in an 8‚Äô x 10‚Äô, often cage-like, windowless cell for 22‚Äì24 hours per day. Some incarcerated people have been held for months, years, even decades, in complete isolation and suffer lifelong psychological and cognitive consequences. To end the use of this practice, NRCAT works to advance legislation banning solitary confinement and educate people of faith nationwide about the torture of solitary confinement through varying methods such as NRCAT's film Breaking Down the Box and its solitary confinement cell replica. As an example of its work, NRCAT drew attention to the summer 2013 hunger strike in California prisons that protested the inhumane conditions, including confinement in long-term isolation. On Thursday, September 5, the 60th day of the third peaceful hunger strike in California prisons, the hunger strike was suspended, with California legislators vowing to take legislative action and host a series of hearings. Over 1,000 clergy and religious leaders throughout the United States supported the hunger strikers call to end torture, joining with NRCAT, the American Friends Service Committee and the Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity Coalition in signing \\"A Religious Call for a Just and Humane End to the Hunger Strike in California Prisons.\\" The letter called on Gov. Brown to honor the hunger strikers‚Äô five core demands in order to bring the hunger strike to a swift and humane end. Advocating for U.S. policies that help end the use of torture by other governments U.S. laws, policies and actions on torture have a profound impact ‚Äì for better or worse ‚Äì on the practices of other governments. The U.S. has had a positive influence on international efforts to prohibit torture, but has also condoned torture by foreign governments. It provides military assistance to certain foreign governments despite their use of torture, and has even provided direct support and training for foreign security forces that torture. NRCAT works to end the use of torture abroad by supporting the Leahy Law, a human rights law that restricts U.S. aid to foreign security forces (police, military, and other) that are credibly alleged to have committed gross human rights violations, like torture, rape, and forced disappearances. Ending anti-Muslim bigotry On September 7, 2010, NRCAT and the Islamic Society of North America organized an event with 40 national religious leaders who stated that the exponentially growing reality of anti-Muslim bigotry, like the opposition to the building of new Mosques and the threat by the pastor in Florida to burn the Qur‚Äôan, was contrary to American values and religious values. Following the meeting, the religious leaders held a press conference that included 38 television cameras and produced 200 press stories in one day. That fall \\"Shoulder-to-Shoulder: Standing with American Muslims; Upholding American Values\\" was created, in which NRCAT has played a major leadership role To continue the efforts to end anti-Muslim bigotry, NRCAT is working to continue the partnership with Shoulder-to-Shoulder, respond to events and acts that are marked by anti- Muslim bigotry, and support religious organizations across the nation that are engaged in ending anti-Muslim sentiment.

It was a chamber orchestra that performed to local acclaim in the Boston Globe and the Boston Phoenix. Concerts took place at Sanders Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Discovery Ensemble's second mission was education. The orchestra presented four Discovery Programs per year, each consisting of two in-school workshops and a matinee concert for children from local schools. The schools' concerts took place at Strand Theatre in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Discovery Ensemble played live regularly on WGBH Radio and was featured as Critics' Choice on NPR.

While it gives the impression of dating to c.1840, it is believed that the house was built between 1814 and 1825. Rienzi plantation house is located directly across Bayou Lafourche from the town of Thibodaux. Despite the proximity of a modern shopping center, the house enjoys a historic setting due to the large live oaks on the property. Two of the oaks are registered in the Live Oak Society. The mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 31, 1980. with a photo and two maps With . Architecture The house is significant both historically and architecturally and was built in the \\"American Style\\" with center hallways, exterior wall fireplaces with great emphasis placed on balance and symmetry. This is in contrast with the earlier \\"Creole Style\\" with rooms arranged en suite with no halls, interior fireplaces and the interior function of the room-defining the placement of windows and doors rather than a more symmetrical plan. However, Rienzi shows a transition from the early style with its primary floor being on the second level and the exposed rafters on the downstairs gallery. The house is thought to be built between 1814 and 1825 is almost square in plan with five bays on each side, measuring approximately 70' by 72'. It is built in the peripteral style, surrounded by galleries with brick pillars on the lower story and wooden pillars on the upper story. The ceilings of the first floor are 10' and 14' on the second story. The walls of the house are brick and lumber used for roof rafters, floor joists, etc. are thought to pit-sawn and employ timber framing techniques, i.e. mortise and tenon joints with pegs. The majority of the lumber is cypress with flooring made of long leaf pine. The most unique feature of the house are the central hallways placed in a cruciform plan on each floor. On the lower floor, the halls were originally open to the outside through brick arches, that not only provided access but structurally acted as a relieving or displacing arch, due to the weight of the brick structure. These have been enclosed with doorways in the early 1850s. It has been stated that the first floor was used to stable animals but with four fireplaces on the ground floor the use was for humans. The two front rooms on the upper floor have slip head windows. It is believed that the house has had significant renovations around 1850, 1900 and 1940 as both style and technology motivated owners to make changes. The house is currently undergoing a restoration (beginning in 2012) with a focus restoring the house to its earlier look. Though the house has some Greek Revival detail, (it actually pre-dates that period) the style of the house has been called Tuscan Revival. The handsome double front staircase was probably added during the 1850s renovation though many believe it was added in the 1930s. Several photos beginning in the 1870s show the double staircase intact. The monumental door surrounds have diamond-shaped ornaments, sidelights and transoms. A modern kitchen wing is located to the rear of the house. Of the many plantation houses in the Lafourche Bayou region, Rienzi Plantation is the only example of the fully developed peripteral mode. Moreover, it is one of the very few examples in the Deep South of a plantation house with a cruciform hall plan. History Rienzi Plantation House sits on property that is believed to be the first Spanish Land grant of Henry Schuyler Thibodeaux, the namesake of the City of Thibodaux. The grant was made by Baron Carondelet in approximately 1792. After the Louisiana purchase, Thibodeaux confirmed that he both inhabited and cultivated the property 10 years prior to the purchase. There is some evidence that a two-story wooden four bay house existed adjacent to the existing house and this is believed to be Thibodeaux's house. (Thibodeaux well after the sale of the property became the 5th Governor of Louisiana.) In 1814 the plantation was sold to Henry Fields, a prominent businessman, and architect. It is believed that Fields is responsible for the house that exists today and his architectural skills enabled him to construct a house that exhibited non-typical futures of houses of that time. In 1825. the plantation was sold to Henry Johnson, Governor of Louisiana at the time of his purchase. He sold the property to Thomas Bibb in 1835, the second governor of Alabama and it is under his ownership that the plantation was first called Rienzi. It is believed that the name comes from the novel and Wagner opera about the 14th-century Italian patriot, that was extremely popular during the 1840s. The next owner, Juan Ignacio de Egana, was probably the source of the romantic legend which has been widely publicized. The legend details that the house was constructed by Spanish architects at the request of Spanish Queen Maria Louisa as a possible retreat for her in the event of a Spanish defeat in the Napoleonic Wars. The legend has it that her agent, Juan Ygnacio de Egana, took possession of the home (after Louisiana was ceded to France and sold to the United States) and proceeded to live in the house for nearly fifty years. However, the conveyance records indicate that Juan Ygnacio de Egana, whatever his connection with the Queen, owned the plantation in 1851 and his estate sold the property to Richard Allen in 1861. The 1860 census lists the \\"Estate of J.Y. de Agana\\" as consisting of 2,799 acres and 306 slaves. Champomier in his sugar report calls this estate \\"Riensy Plantation.\\" In 1859 this plantation produced 950 hogsheads of sugar, by far the most in Lafourche Parish. Laborers on Rienzi were some of the first to strike during the fall of 1887 in a movement organized by the Knights of Labor in Thibodaux and the surrounding parishes. During the violence that ensued, Rienzi's overseer was shot in the face, though not severely injured. When white vigilantes went on a shooting spree to end the strike, three victims of the massacre died on the plantation's grounds. In 1896 Emile Morvant and J. B. Levert bought the plantation in a joint partnership. Subsequently, J.B. Levert acquired the Morvants' interest in 1922 and formed the J.B Levert Land, Inc. In 2004 it was gifted to Nicholls State University and in 2012 purchased by the current owner. The house remains a private residence.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The plantation was owned by Joseph Tucker, a Virginian, who bought more than 50,000 acres of land along Bayou Lafourche. The earliest structures on the property date to the 1830s. It was at one time the largest producer of sugar in Lafourche Parish, and a mill was built on the property for this purpose. As many as 135 slaves lived and worked on the property prior to the Civil War. While the main house built by Tucker was destroyed during the Civil War, shotgun houses (slave quarters) and Creole cabins remain on the property. The mill stopped production in the 1930s, and sustained significant damage during Hurricane Betsy in 1965. It is named after where it is located. Laurel Valley today With over fifty original structures remaining it is the largest surviving 19th- and 20th-century sugar plantation complex left in the United States and is still a working sugarcane farm. The general store on the property is open to the public, displaying tools and farm implements used in the cultivation of sugar cane as well as locally made arts and crafts. The store wasn't originally at the plantation, it had to be moved there. Its proprietor was Leon Z. Boudreaux. Laurel Valley Plantation was added as a historic district to the National Register of Historic Places on March 24, 1978.

Biography Hill was born in Redcar, Yorkshire, the son of Frank Hill, and grandson of Richard Hill. He was educated at the Grange School in Crowborough, East Sussex, and at Charterhouse School, Surrey. He left school at Easter 1917, about the time of his 18th birthday, and joined the Royal Flying Corps. From cadet he was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on 21 June, and on 25 August was appointed a flying officer (observer) and confirmed in his rank, with seniority from 22 July. Posted to No. 20 Squadron, Hill gained his first victory on 19 August, in a F.E.2d, piloted by Second Lieutenant C. B. Simpson, by driving down 'out of control' an Albatros D.V over Comines. For all his subsequent victories, which were all over D.Vs, he was in a Bristol F.2b piloted by Lieutenant Harry Luchford. They were all gained in a three-week period from 9 September and 1 October. Hill was awarded the Military Cross on 27 October, which was gazetted on 15 March 1918. His citation read: :Temporary Second Lieutenant Richard Frank Hill, General List and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He has carried out a great deal of useful observation work, and has proved himself an excellent fighting observer. On one occasion, when acting as observer on a photographic reconnaissance, he and his pilot shot down and destroyed two enemy scouts. He has also destroyed three other hostile machines.\\" Hill then returned to England, and on 14 May 1918 his status was changed from Lieutenant (Observer Officer) to Lieutenant (Aeroplane & Seaplanes), signifying that he had qualified as a pilot. However, Hill died on 17 September 1918, after undergoing two operations for appendicitis. He is buried at Holy Trinity Church, High Hurstwood, Buxted, Sussex.

It established the National Coal Board as the managing authority for coal mining and coal processing activities. It also initially provided for the establishment of consumers' councils. The Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 was the first of a number of Acts promulgated by the post-war Labour government to nationalise elements of the UK's industrial infrastructure; other Acts include the Electricity Act 1947; the Transport Act 1947 (railways and long-distance road haulage); the Gas Act 1948; and the Iron and Steel Act 1949.  Background  The Coal Industry Nationalisation Bill was published in December 1945 by the Minister of Fuel and Power, Emanuel Shinwell. Several commentators have noted that the Bill was imperfect and had been ‚Äòhastily cobbled together‚Äô, just four months after the King's Speech. However, this approach was expedient for the government as the coal mining industry was in a poor state following the war and the government wished to show that their manifesto commitments were being implemented. The coal industry nationalisation was different to later enactments. The owners of coal mines and facilities were compensated with government stock; this demonstrated to the miners, who were powerful political force, that the industry belonged to the nation. For later nationalisations compensation was by stock issued by the relevant Board. This simplified the system as compensation was based in the market value of shares in the relevant undertaking.  Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946  The Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 received royal assent on 12 July 1946. Its long title is ‚ÄòAn Act to establish public ownership and control of the coal-mining industry and certain allied activities; and for purposes connected therewith.‚Äô  Provisions  The provisions of the act comprise 65 sections in nine parts, plus four schedules. * The National Coal Board *: Sections 1‚Äì4: Establishment of National Coal Board, its functions, constitution, power of the Minister, and establishment of Consumers' councils, * Transfer of assets to the Board *: Sections 5‚Äì9: Transfer of assets; interests in patents and designs; rights and liabilities; use of certain property; determination of questions of transfer, * Compensation for transfer of assets *: Sections 10‚Äì16: Compensation for transfer and basis for assessment; allocation of transferred interests; Central and District Valuation Boards; compensation; payment of costs; time limits, * Compensation for severance, and refunds of capital outlay *: Sections 17 & 18: Compensation for severance; refund of capital outlay * Satisfaction and disposal of compensation *: Sections 19‚Äì25: Date of compensation; recipients of compensation; mode of satisfaction; interim income; satisfaction of compensation; restrictions on disposal of stock; protection; debenture and shareholders of companies, * Financial provisions *: Sections 26‚Äì35: Advances by the minister; borrowing powers; payments to the minister; reserve fund; surplus revenues; accounts and audits; issue of stock; general provisions of stock; Consolidated Fund; payments and advances to the Board; account of receipts, * Savings, and provisions consequential on nationalisation *: Sections 36‚Äì45: Provision of superannuation rights; transfer of property; functions of the Coal Commission; abolition of coal advisory committee; Miners' Welfare Commission; safety and health research; winding-up of coal-selling schemes; Doncaster Drainage District, * Miscellaneous provisions as to the Board *: Sections 46‚Äì54: Terms and conditions of employment; taxation; transfer of liability for subsidence; liability of the board; workmen's compensation liabilities; documents of the board; plans of workings; transferred documents; annual report, * General *: Sections 55‚Äì65: Payment of certain expenses; disclosure of information; penalties; prosecutions and offences; notices; arbitration; regulations; interpretation application to Scotland; short title, extent and repeal. * First schedule *: Assets to be transferred to the board * Second schedule *: Transfer to the board of rights and liabilities under contracts * Third schedule *: Provisions as to Selling Schemes under part I of the Coal Mines Act 1930, and as to the South Yorkshire Mines Drainage Committee * Fourth schedule *: Enactments repealed  Later enactments  The following Acts amended elements of the 1946 Act.

The Miners‚Äô Welfare Act 1952 (15 and 16 Geo. 6 and 1 Eliz. 2 c. 23) dissolved the Miners‚Äô Welfare Commission. The Coal Industry Act 1956 (c. 61). The Coal Industry Act 1965 (1965 c. 82) made provision for borrowing by, and loans by the Minister of Power to, the National Coal Board. The Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act 1966 (c. 4) consolidated Part I of the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act 1923. The Coal Industry Act 1971 (1971 c. 16) extended the powers of the National Coal Board. The Coal Industry Act 1977 (1977 c. 39) amended the financial powers of the National Coal Board. The Coal Industry Act 1987 (1987 c. 3) changed the name of the National Coal Board to the British Coal Corporation. The Coal Industry Act 1990 (1990 c. 3) made new provision for grants by the Secretary of State to the British Coal Corporation. The Coal Industry Act 1994 (1994 c. 21) established the functions of a new body the Coal Authority; restructured the coal industry, transferred the property, rights and liabilities of the British Coal Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries; and made provision for the dissolution of the corporation; abolished the Domestic Coal Consumers‚Äô Council.

History Graff was founded in London in 1960 by Laurence Graff. Sourcing Graff adheres to the Kimberley Process, never knowingly buying or trading rough diamonds from areas where this would encourage conflict or human suffering. The majority of Graff diamonds are laser engraved with unique Gemological Institute of America (GIA) tracking numbers, which whilst invisible to the naked eye, allow for their origin to be traced. Graff‚Äôs cutting and polishing processes are carried out in Johannesburg by the South African Diamond Corporation, a division of Graff. Notable diamonds The Windsor Yellows were acquired by Laurence Graff in 1987 in Geneva during the auction of the jewels belonging to Wallis Simpson, Duchess of Windsor. The Duchess was often photographed wearing the Windsor Yellows, a pair of clips of fancy yellow pear shaped diamonds of 51.01 and 40.22 carats respectively. \\"I also bought another pair of clips the Duchess had owned,\\" Laurence Graff explains. \\"Of course they needed re-cutting to bring them to their full potential, I bought all four, repolished them, and eventually made the Windsor earrings.\\"\\"The Most Fabulous Jewels In the World\\", Meredith Etherington-Smith, 1997 The Paragon diamond was acquired by Graff in 1989.

The Lesotho Promise was acquired as a rough stone for $12.4 million in 2006. The stone was cut by a team of 35 using computer-controlled lasers into 26 D-flawless diamonds totaling , the highest yield from a single diamond. In July 2007 the finished stones were unveiled. The largest gem cut from the diamond was a pear-shaped diamond; the smallest a round brilliant. In all, twenty-six stones were fashioned from the rough gem, figuring as seven pear shapes, four emerald cuts, thirteen round brilliants and one heart shape. The finished gems total . The Letseng Legacy diamond was unearthed from the same mine as the Lesotho Promise Letseng diamond mine in 2008 and totalled 493cts. Acquired by Graff for $10.4 million, they yielded 20 diamonds totaling 231.67cts from the one rough stone. The Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond is a fancy deep-blue diamond with internally flawless clarity purchased by Laurence Graff in 2008 for ¬£16.4 million. The Delaire Sunrise is, at 118.08 carats, the largest square emerald cut Fancy Vivid Yellow diamond in the world. Discovered in 2008 at an alluvial mine in South Africa, the 221.81 carat rough diamond. When Laurence Graff unveiled the finished diamond, he named it \\"the Delaire Sunrise\\". The Constellation is, at 102.79 carats, the largest round shaped, D colour, Internally Flawless diamond ever to be graded by the Gemological Institute of America. The Graff Pink was acquired by Graff in November 2010. A pink diamond with a type IIa classification and modified emerald cut shape, the diamond was previously held in a private collection for over 60 years. The diamond displayed 25 natural flaws. The recut 23.88 carat diamond displayed new colour, clarity and internal flawlessness. The Graff Sweethearts were originally two rough diamonds weighing 196 carats and 184 carats discovered at the Letseng Mine in Lesotho. After cutting they produced a 51.53 ct D colour Flawless type IIa and a 50.76 ct D colour Flawless type IIa, both heart- shaped.

It was built 1894 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 1, 1982. History Louisiana State Senator, and third generation sugar cane farmer, John Dalton Shaffer was looking for a home for his wife, Julia Richardson Cutliff Shaffer. Mrs. Shaffer requested that her husband build her a little cottage that overlooked Bayou Black. In 1888, he purchased approximately one thousand acres of land in Schriever, Louisiana. He then commissioned New Orleans based architect, John Williams of Williams and Brothers to design and build the main residence on a twenty-acre tract. The location of the house on the property lead, in part, to the name. ‚ÄúArdoyne‚Äù in Scottish means ‚Äúlittle hill or knoll‚ÄùRoberts, Celeste. \\"Ardoyne Plantation: Where The Past Meets Present.\\" What Now Magazine June 2014: 25-30. Print. which was the high point of the property, and the name of a Scottish castle. The construction of the main residence began in 1890 and was completed in 1894. Local immigrants of German, Italian and African descent contributed the labor to build the residence and later would comprise a good portion of the labor force that would work the remaining land. These same immigrant workers harvested the cypress and pine trees from the land that was then sent to a mill in St. Louis, Missouri to become the construction lumber for the house. Design Ardoyne Plantation is set in a cluster of live oak trees overlooking Bayou Black. This two-story home stands starkly different than the other homes of this era. Looking at the front, the Gothic Revival architecture design adds elements that capture the attention. There is a seventy-five-foot tower at the left, as seen from the front, and two high gables. The tower is ‚Äúiced‚Äù with fine mill work, commonly referred to as ‚Äúgingerbread‚Äù. This ‚Äúgingerbread‚Äù is continued around the top of the gables. The steep roof line accentuates the tower and gables. The walk through window in the tower contrasts with the bay widow of the left gable. The right gable, much narrower and equally as steep, barely frames the window it protects. The entrance porch is supported by square wooden columns, bannisters and high, walk-in windows. The double entrance door is directly below the center gable of the house, but just a little off-centered to the right side. The boldness of the second story tower, gables and windows overshadow the simple entrance doorway. The woodwork for the house, which was milled from the trees from the property, is present in every room of the house. Floors, walls, ceilings and molding are all native wood. There is a seventy-foot-long hallway that leads to a curving cypress stairwell that leads to the second floor. The plantation office is located on the first floor of the tower and the inlaid wood ceiling mirrors the shape of the octagon structure of the tower. Each room is spacious and lit by chandeliers of crystal and brass. The side porch, which has an Eden-like view of the garden is screened in. In the south, this is commonly called a ‚Äúmosquito porch‚Äù. There was a ‚Äúcoach porch‚Äù, which is a porch that was tall enough that a horse driven coach could pass through, that was destroyed by Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and never rebuilt. Connection to Other Plantations The first Shaffer to migrate to Terrebonne Parish was William Alexander Shaffer, John Dalton's grandfather. William came to Louisiana from Camden County, South Caroline in 1828. He moved to Terrebonne Parish and built Crescent Farm Plantation just three miles south of Ardoyne Plantation. Crescent Farm Plantation is still in existence today and house the office of local attorneys St. Martin and Bourque. After the Civil War, William Alexander's son, John Jackson Shaffer, purchased another sugar cane plantation for himself in 1874, also on Highway 311. Magnolia Plantation was built in 1858 and is only three miles south of Schriever. Magnolia Plantation is one of six surviving Greek Revival style plantation homes in Terrebonne Parish and is currently a private residence. It is located five miles north of Ardoyne and was used as a Union hospital during the Civil War. It is still in the Shaffer family and a portion of the film, 12 Years A Slave was filmed there. Milhado Lee Shaffer married Margaret Krumbhaar, whom had grown up on the Krumbhaar Plantation, which united the two sugar families. The Krumbhaar family, through Margaret's Grandfather, William J. Minor built the famous Southdown Plantation. This plantation home is also on Highway 311 only a few miles from Downtown Houma, Louisiana, about seven miles from Ardoyne. Today it serves as a museum of local history and gathering place for many outings, music and craft events. Margaret Krumbhaar can also trace her family lineage back to Eleanor Parke Custis Lewis maternal granddaughter of Martha Washington, the wife of President George Washington. Ardoyne Plantation House Today Ardoyne Plantation has been in the Shaffer family for six generations. It is currently owned by Lee and Susan Shaffer. Lee is a retired military veteran. They currently reside on the second floor of the house. They moved into the house after the passing of Lee's grandmother, Margaret Krumbhaar Shaffer in 2007 at the age of ninety-three. The home is open for tours most every week from Tuesday through Saturday with tours at 9:30 AM, 11:30 AM, and 2:00 PM with no appointments necessary. Each room is a mini museum of fine furniture, paintings and other family and era specific heirlooms from the family's past. Visitors can see Louisiana cypress knee dolls, 300+ antique travel spoons, plantation workers‚Äô pay tokens, antique quilts and needlework, Newcomb pottery, over two-thousand books, wood carvings, and many other sights original to the plantation. It has also been used as a set location for several motion pictures and television shows. There are also about three hundred and fifty acres of active sugar cane farming still taking place on the property.

The exact boundaries of this geographical region may be defined differently depending on the context. In its traditional sense, the term Upper Harz covers the area of the seven historical mining towns (Bergst√§dte) - Clausthal, Zellerfeld, Andreasberg, Altenau, Lautenthal, Wildemann and Grund - in the present-day German federal state of Lower Saxony. Orographically, it comprises the Harz catchment areas of the S√∂se, Innerste and Grane, Oker and Abzucht mountain streams, all part of the larger Weser watershed. Much of the Upper Harz area is up to above sea level. In a wider sense, it also comprises the adjacent High Harz (Hochharz) range in the east, climbing to over in the Brocken massif.  Geography  The region is centred on the geological structure of the region around the municipality of Clausthal-Zellerfeld, merged in 1924. From the Clausthal Kulmfaltenzone, it extends to the western and northern rim of the Harz and is bordered in the southeast by the Acker-Bruchberg ridge beyond the S√∂se valley. The Upper Harz was, for centuries, dominated by the hugely profitable silver mining industry and is also distinguished by its own dialect (see below). The mining area of Sankt Andreasberg occupies a special place in this regard, because it is just east of the Bruchberg. The mines, more than anything else, have left a lasting impression on the region and left their traces in the towns and villages as well as the countryside (see e.g. Upper Harz Water Regale). Clausthal- Zellerfeld was known as \\"Capital of the Upper Harz\\" in the heyday of the mining industry. It was also the administrative seat of the former Samtgemeinde ('collective municipality') of Oberharz. Another division into Upper and Lower Harz is based on the function of the Harz as a natural watershed. On this basis \\"by taking the Brocken as the mid-point, the Upper Harz includes everything to the west of it; the Lower Harz everything lying to the east. [‚Ä¶] All that drains from the western mountains belongs to the catchment area of the Weser, all that drains from those in the east, to that of the Elbe\\". Heinrich Heine also used the Brocken as the dividing line in his book Die Harzreise (\\"The Harz Journey\\") in 1824 and remarked that the \\"Lower Harz, as the eastern side of the Brocken is called, as opposed to its western side, [‚Ä¶] called the Upper Harz\\". This definition extends the montane Upper Harz eastwards roughly to the state border with Saxony-Anhalt, so that e.g. Braunlage or Hohegei√ü may also be counted as lying within the Upper Harz, as well as some high mountain ridges: To the east it transitions to the less prominent Lower Harz which descends gently eastwards. The High Harz (Hochharz) refers to the only sparsely populated region around the Brocken (1,141 m), Bruchberg, Wurmberg, Torfhaus and Acker, which lie above 800 m. The High Harz therefore includes most of the Harz National Park.  Upper Harz dialect  One feature of the Upper Harz is, or was, the Upper Harz dialect (Oberharzer Mundart). Unlike the Lower Saxon, Eastphalian and Thuringian dialects of its surround area, this is an Erzgebirgisch dialect that goes back to the settlement in the area of mining folk from the Ore Mountains of Saxony in the 16th century. The Upper Harz dialect is restricted to only a few places and so forms something of a language island in the Harz. The best known are Altenau, Sankt Andreasberg, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Lautenthal and Hahnenklee. Today the dialect is rarely heard in everyday life in the Upper Harz. It is mainly members of the older generations that still speak it; as a result it is maintained in the newspapers. For example, there are occasionally articles published in the Upper Harz dialect in the local section of the Goslarsche Zeitung. To illustrate the dialect here is the refrain of a Sankt Andreasberg folk song: :Eb de Sunne scheint, ebs stewert, schtarmt, ebs schneit, bei Tag un Nacht ohmds oder frieh wie h√§misch klingst de doch du ewerharzer Sproch O Annerschbarrich wie bist de schien.  Customs and tradition  * Easter Fire (Osterfeuer): In the Upper Harz the Easter fires are built with the aid of a wooden frame in the centre of which is a spruce tree. The tree is several metres higher than the wooden structure that is covered with brushwood and spruce branches. Traditionally the visitors are blackened, i.e. their faces are smeared with soot from the charred wood. In Wildemann at Easter Fire they also carry Easter torches over three metres long. * Kurrende: During the mining era it was common for 10- to 18-year-old apprentices (Pochjungen) to parade through the streets in black coats and hats as part of a Kurrende or school choir in order to earn additional income by singing. From the age of ten - later fourteen - the apprentices worked in the crushing mills or Pochwerken where they separated ore from the rest of the rock for 12 hours a day. Not until their 18th birthday were they allowed to begin training as miners and work in the mines. The Kurrende tradition was preserved for a few years after the decline of the mines in the Upper Harz by the, mainly church- based, choirs. Today, on the important holy days, the choral society of St. Martin's parish performs the last Kurrende in the Upper Harz in Sankt Andreasberg, dressed in traditional costume.  Upper Harz conflict  The town of Elbingerode and the municipalities of Brocken-Hochharz in the district of Harz decided to merge on 1 January 2010, as part of regional reforms in Saxony-Anhalt, into a new town with the name 'Oberharz am Brocken'. There were major protests against this name in the borough of Oberharz in Lower Saxony. The reasons were that, on the one hand, there was a significant risk of confusion by having two similar names, and on the other hand that the new region had never belonged to the Upper Harz, but was part of the Lower Harz.Stellungnahme der Samtgemeinde Oberharz  See also  * Harz  References  References  * Der Oberharz und seine Grenzen (\\"The Upper Harz and its Boundaries\\"), article in the special supplement of the Goslarschen Zeitung of 1 October 2008. * * .

The dispute between Thomas Henry Huxley and Richard Owen became central to the scientific debate on human evolution that followed Charles Darwin's publication of On the Origin of Species. The name comes from the title of a satire the Reverend Charles Kingsley wrote about the arguments, which in modified form appeared as \\"the great hippopotamus test\\" in Kingsley's 1863 book for children, The Water- Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby. Together with other humorous skits on the topic, this helped to spread and popularise Darwin's ideas on evolution. The key point that Owen asserted was that only humans had part of the brain then known as the hippocampus minor (now called the calcar avis), and that this gave us our unique abilities. Careful dissection eventually showed that apes and monkeys also have a hippocampus minor. Background In October 1836 Charles Darwin returned from the Beagle voyage with fossil collections which the anatomist Richard Owen described, contributing to the inception of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin outlined his theory in an Essay of 1844, and discussed transmutation with his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker. He did not tell Owen, who as the up-and-coming \\"English Cuvier\\" held the conventional belief that every species was uniquely created and perfectly adapted. Owen's brilliance and political skills made him a leading figure in the scientific establishment, developing ideas of divine archetypes produced by vague secondary laws similar to a form of theistic evolution, while emphasising the differences separating man from ape. At the end of 1844 the anonymous book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation brought wide public interest in transmutation of species and the idea that humans were descended from apes, and after a slow initial response, strong condemnation from the scientific establishment. Darwin discussed his interest in transmutation with friends including Charles Lyell, and Hooker eventually read Darwin's Essay in 1847. When Thomas Henry Huxley savagely reviewed the latest edition of Vestiges in 1854, Darwin wrote to him, making friends while cautiously admitting to being \\"almost as unorthodox about species\\". Huxley had become increasingly irritated by Owen's condescension and manipulation, and having gained a teaching position at the school of mining, began openly attacking Owen's work. Hippocampus minor In 1564 a prominent feature on the floor of the lateral ventricles of the brain was named the hippocampus by Aranzi as its curved shape on each side supposedly reminded him of a seahorse, the Hippocampus (though Mayer mistakenly used the term hippopotamus in 1779, and was followed by several others until 1829). At that same time a ridge on the occipital horn was named the calcar avis, but in 1786 this was renamed the hippocampus minor, with the hippocampus being called the hippocampus major. hippocampus minor is a small fold on the occipital horn towards the back of the brain (to the right) to the rear of the hippocampus major which forms a curved ridge on each side of the lower central area. Richard Owen presented several papers on the anatomical differences between apes and humans, arguing that they had been created separately and stressing the impossibility of apes being transmuted into men. In 1857 he went even further, presenting an authoritative paper to the Linnean Society of London on his anatomical studies of primate brains and asserting that humans were not merely a distinct biological order of primates, as had been accepted by great anatomists such as Carl Linnaeus and Georges Cuvier, but a separate sub-class of mammalia, distinct from all the other primates and mammals generally. Owen supported his argument with a figure by himself of a South American monkey, a figure of a negro's brain by Friedrich Tiedemann, and of a chimpanzee's brain by Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk and Willem Vrolik. While Owen conceded the \\"all- pervading similitude of structure‚Äîevery tooth, every bone, strictly homologous\\" which made it difficult for anatomists to determine the difference between man and ape, he based his new classification on three characteristics which to him distinguished mankind's \\"highest form of brain\\", the most important being his claim that only the human brain has a hippocampus minor. To Owen in 1857, this feature together with the extent to which the \\"posterior lobe\\" projected beyond the cerebellum and the presence of the posterior horn were how man \\"fulfills his destiny as the supreme master of this earth and of the lower creation.\\" Charles Darwin commented, \\"Owen's is a grand Paper; but I cannot swallow Man making a division as distinct from a Chimpanzee, as an ornithorhynchus from a Horse: I wonder what a Chimpanzee wd. say to this?\\". Owen repeated the paper as the Rede Lecture at the University of Cambridge on 10 May 1859 when he was the first to be given an honorary degree by the university. To Thomas Henry Huxley the claim about the hippocampus minor appeared to be a significant blunder by Owen, and Huxley began systematically dissecting the brains of monkeys, determined that \\"before I have done with that mendacious humbug I will nail him out, like a kite to a barn door, an example to all evil doers.\\" He did not discuss this in public at this stage, but continued to attack Owen's other ideas, aiming to undermine Owen's status. At his 17 June 1858 Royal Institution Croonian Lecture \\"On the Theory of the Vertebrate Skull\\", Huxley directly challenged Owen's central idea of archetypes shown by homology, with Owen in the audience. Huxley's aim was to overcome the domination of science by wealthy clergymen led by Owen, in order to create a professional salaried scientific civil service and make science secular. Under Darwin's influence he took up transmutation as a way of dividing science from theology, and in January 1859 argued that \\"it is as respectable to be modified monkey as modified dirt\\". Owen and Huxley debate human and ape brain structure Following publication of Darwin's theory, ape ancestry became a fashionable talking point: in May 1861, an \\"alarmed flunkey\\" stammers in announcing \\"Mr G-G-G-O-O-O-Rilla. Huxley was among the friends rallying round the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species, and was sharpening his \\"beak and claws\\" to disembowel \\"the curs who will bark and yelp\\". Charles Kingsley was sent a review copy, and told Darwin that he had \\"long since, from watching the crossing of domesticated animals and plants, learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species.\\" Darwin was delighted that this \\"celebrated author and divine\\" had \\"gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws.\\" While reviews were by custom anonymous, their authors were usually known. Huxley's reviews of On the Origin of Species irritated Owen, whose own anonymous review in April praised himself and his own axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things, took offence at the way the creationist position had been depicted, and complained that his own pre-eminence had been ignored. Owen bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\", with new species appearing by natural birth. The dispute between Huxley and Owen over human uniqueness began in public at the 1860 Oxford evolution debate, during a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford on Thursday 28 June 1860. After Charles Daubeny's paper \\"On the Final Causes of the Sexuality of Plants with Particular Reference to Mr. Darwin's Work\\", the chairman asked Huxley for comments, but he declined as he thought the public venue inappropriate. Owen then spoke of facts which would enable the public to \\"come to some conclusions ... of the truth of Mr. Darwin's theory\\", reportedly arguing that \\"the brain of the gorilla was more different from that of man than from that of the lowest primate particularly because only man had a posterior lobe, a posterior horn, and a hippocampus minor.\\" In response, Huxley flatly but politely \\"denied altogether that the difference between the brain of the gorilla and man was so great\\" in a \\"direct and unqualified contradiction\\" of Owen, citing previous studies as well as promising to provide detailed support for his position. Anguish over the death of his son of scarlet fever in September 1860 pushed Huxley to the brink, from which Kingsley rescued him by a series of letters. Huxley put his fury over the death into composing a paper which violently assaulted Owen's ideas and professional reputation. It was published in January 1861 in the first issue of Huxley's relaunched Natural History Review magazine, and presented citations, quotations and letters from leading anatomists to attack Owen's three claims, aiming to prove him \\"guilty of wilful and deliberate falsehood\\" by citing Owen himself, and (with less clear cut justification) the anatomists whose illustrations Owen had used in the 1857 paper. While readily agreeing that the human brain differed from that of apes in size, proportions and complexity of convolutions, Huxley played the significance of these features down, and argued that to a lesser extent these also differed between the \\"highest\\" and \\"lowest\\" human races. Darwin congratulated Huxley on this \\"smasher\\" against the \\"canting humbug\\" Owen. From February to May Huxley delivered a very popular series of sixpenny lectures for working men at the School of Mines where he taught, on \\"The Relation of Man to the Rest of the Animal Kingdom\\". He told his wife that \\"My working men stick by me wonderfully, the house being fuller than ever last night. By next Friday evening they will all be convinced that they are monkeys.\\" Owen's illustration of the brains of The Gorilla and the Negro. Gorillas became the topic of the day with the return of the explorer Paul Du Chaillu. Owen arranged for him to speak and display his collections on stage at a spectacular Royal Geographical Society meeting on 25 February, and followed this by giving a lecture at the Royal Institution on 19 March on the brains of The Gorilla and the Negro, asserting that the dispute was one of interpretation rather than fact, and hedging his previous claim by stating that humans alone had a hippocampus minor \\"as defined in human anatomy\\". This lecture was published in the Athen√¶um on 23 March with unlabelled and inaccurate illustrations, and Huxley's response in the next issue a week later, Man and the Apes, ridiculed Owen's use of these illustrations and failure to mention the findings of anatomists that the three structures were present in animals. In the following week's issue Owen's letter blamed \\"the Artist\\" for the illustrations, but claimed that the argument was correct and referred the reader to his 1858 paper. In the Athen√¶um of 13 April Huxley responded to this repetition of the claim by writing that \\"Life is too short to occupy oneself with the slaying of the slain more than once.\\" Each Saturday, Darwin read the latest ripostes in the Athen√¶um. Owen tried to smear Huxley by portraying him as an \\"advocate of man's origins from a transmuted ape\\", and one of his contributions was titled \\"Ape-Origin of Man as Tested by the Brain\\". This backfired, as Huxley had already delighted Darwin by speculating on \\"pithecoid man\\" (ape-like man), and was glad of the invitation to publicly turn the anatomy of brain structure into a question of human ancestry. Darwin egged him on from Down, writing \\"Oh Lord what a thorn you must be in the poor dear man's side\\". Huxley told Darwin's friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, \\"Owen occupied an entirely untenable position ... The fact is he made a prodigious blunder in commencing the attack, and now his only chance is to be silent and let people forget the exposure. I do not believe that in the whole history of science there is a case of any man of reputation getting himself into such a contemptible position. He will be the laughing-stock of all the continental anatomists.\\" Public interest and satire This very public slanging match attracted wide attention, and humorists were quick to take up the opportunity for satire. Punch featured the issue several times that year, notably on 18 May 1861 when a cartoon under the heading Monkeyana showed a standing gorilla with a sign parodying Josiah Wedgwood's anti-slavery slogan \\"Am I Not A Man And A Brother?\\". This was accompanied by a satirical poem by \\"Gorilla\\" at the zoo asking to be told if he was \\"A man in ape's shape, An anthropoid ape, Or monkey deprived of his tail?\\", and noting: Am I A Man And A Brother? It then recounts Huxley's ripostes, and: The poem was actually by the eminent palaeontologist Sir Philip Egerton who, as a trustee of the Royal College of Surgeons and the British Museum, acted as Owen's patron. When a delighted Huxley found out who the author of the piece was, he thought it \\"speaks volumes for Owen's perfect success in damning himself.\\" In the second issue of Huxley's Natural History Review, an article by George Rolleston on the orangutan brain showed the features that Owen claimed apes lacked, and when Owen responded in a letter to the Annals and Magazine of Natural History that the issue was a matter of definition rather than fact, Huxley made a public dissection of a spider monkey that had died at the zoo, to support his case. In the following issue John Marshall provided detailed measurements making the same point about the chimpanzee, as well as explaining how a chimpanzee's brain could be distorted by not being properly preserved and removed from the skull, so that it would look like the one in Owen's illustration. The Great Hippocampus Question The debate continued in 1862. A detailed paper by William Henry Flower in the prestigious journal, the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, reviewed the earlier literature and presented his own studies based on having dissected sixteen species of primates, including prosimians, monkeys and an orangutan. Having stated at the outset that he had no opinion on transmutation or the origin of humans, he refuted Owen's three claims, and went further, stating that in relation to the mass of the brain, the hippocampus minor was proportionately largest in the marmoset, and proportionately smallest in mankind. The paper used terms recently coined by Huxley, and Flower was one of his close colleagues. Huxley presented more evidence against Owen in his Natural History Review. The Dutch anatomists Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk and Willem Vrolik found that Owen had repeatedly used their 1849 illustration of a chimpanzee's brain to support his arguments, and to prevent the public from being misled they dissected the brain of an orangutan that had died in the Amsterdam zoo, reporting at a meeting of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences that the three features Owen claimed were unique to humans were present in this ape. They admitted that their earlier illustration was incorrect due to the way they had removed the brain for inspection, and suggested that Owen had become \\"lost\\" and \\"fell into a trap\\" in debating against Darwin. Huxley reprinted the report, in French, in his Review. His confrontations with Owen went on. Lord Dundreary, as featured in the play Our American Cousin noted for its association with the Abraham Lincoln assassination in 1865. At the 1862 British Association meeting in Cambridge that year, Owen presented two papers opposing Darwin: one claimed that the adaptations of the Aye-aye disproved evolution, and the second paper reiterated Owen's claims about human brains being unique, as well as discussing the question of whether apes have toes or thumbs. Huxley said Owen appeared to be \\"lying & shuffling\\", and Huxley's allies presented successive attacks on Owen. This was the first British Association annual meeting attended by Charles Kingsley, and during the meeting he produced a privately printed satirical skit on the argument, \\"a little squib for circulation among his friends\\" written in the style of the then popular stage character Lord Dundreary, a good natured but brainless aristocrat known for huge bushy sideburns and for mangling proverbs or sayings in \\"Dundrearyisms\\". The skit was titled Speech of Lord Dundreary in Section D, on Friday Last, On the Great Hippocampus Question. The British Medical Journal asked, \\"Is it not high time that the annual passage of barbed words between Professor Owen and Professor Huxley, on the cerebral distinction between men and monkeys, should cease? ... Continued on its present footing, it becomes a hindrance and an injury to science, a joke for the populace, and a scandal to the scientific world.\\" The London Quarterly Review took up the joke, describing the confrontation of Owen with Huxley and his supporters Rolleston and Flower dramatically: \\"Animation increased, 'decorous reticence' was at an end, and all parties enjoyed the scene except the disputants. Surely apes were never before so honoured, as to be the theme of the warmest discussion in one of the two principal university towns in England. Strange sight was this, that three or four most accomplished anatomists were contending against each other like so many gorillas, and either reducing man to a monkey, or elevating the monkey to the man!\\" In October the Medical Times and Gazette reported Owen's presentation with full detail of the responses by Huxley, Rolleston and Flower, as well as Owen's rebuttal. The dispute continued in the next two issues of the magazine. The great hippopotamus test Richard Owen and Thomas Henry Huxley inspect a water baby in a large carboy, in Linley Sambourne's 1885 illustration At about the same time as he was attending the Cambridge British Association meeting in 1862, instalments of Charles Kingsley's story for children The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby were being published in Macmillan's Magazine as a serial. Kingsley incorporated material modified from his skit about Dundreary's speech On the Great Hippocampus Question, as well as other references to the protagonists, the British Association, and notable scientists of the day. When the protagonist Tom is turned into a water-baby by the fairies, the question is raised that if there were water-babies, surely someone would have caught one and \\"put it into spirits, or into the Illustrated News, or perhaps cut it into two halves, poor dear little thing, and sent one to Professor Owen, and one to Professor Huxley, to see what they would each say about it.\\" As for the suggestion that a water-baby is contrary to nature; Keeping up an even-handed treatment, Kingsley introduced as a character in the story Professor Ptthmllnsprts (Put-them-all-in-spirits) as an amalgam of Owen and Huxley, satirising each in turn. Like the very possessive Owen, the Professor was \\"very good to all the world as long as it was good to him. Only one fault he had, which cock-robins have likewise, as you may see if you look out of the nursery window‚Äîthat, when any one else found a curious worm, he would hop round them, and peck them, and set up his tail, and bristle up his feathers, just as a cock-robin would; and declare that he found the worm first; and that it was his worm; and, if not, that then it was not a worm at all.\\" Like Huxley, \\"the professor had not the least notion of allowing that things were true, merely because people thought them beautiful. ... The professor, indeed, went further, and held that no man was forced to believe anything to be true, but what he could see, hear, taste, or handle.\\" A paragraph on \\"the great hippopotamus test\\" opens with the Professor, like Huxley, declaring \\"that apes had hippopotamus majors in their brains just as men have\\", but then like Owen presenting the argument that \\"If you have a hippopotamus major in your brain, you are no ape\\". Then, presented with the awkward question, \\"But why are there not water-babies?\\", the Professor in Huxley's characteristic voice answered quite sharply: \\"Because there ain‚Äôt.\\" The Water-Babies was published in book form in 1863, and in the same year an even more satirical short play was published anonymously by George Pycroft. In A Report of a Sad Case Recently Tried before the Lord Mayor, Owen versus Huxley... the Great Bone Case, the vulgarity of the behaviour of Owen and Huxley is parodied as them being taken to court for brawling in the streets and disturbing the peace. In court, they shout terms such as \\"posterior cornu\\" and \\"hippocampus minor\\". In giving evidence, Huxley states \\"Well, as I was saying, Owen and me is in the same trade; and we both cuts up monkeys, and I finds something in the brains of them. Hallo! says I, here's a hippocampus. No, there ain't says Owen. Look here says I. I can't see it he says and he sets to werriting and haggling about it, and goes and tells everybody, as what I finds ain't there, and what he finds is\\". Man's Place in Nature Huxley's book on Man's Place in Nature used illustrations to show that humans and apes had the same basic anatomy. Huxley expanded his lectures for working men into a book titled Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature, published in 1863. His intention was expressed in a letter to Charles Lyell which referred to the Monkeyana poem of 1861: \\"I do not think you will find room to complain of any want of distinctness in my definition of Owen's position touching the Hippocampus question. I mean to give the whole history of the business in a note, so that the paraphrase of Sir Ph. Egerton's line 'To which Huxley replies that Owen he lies', shall be unmistakable.\\" Darwin exclaimed, \\"Hurrah the monkey book has come\\". A central part of the book provides a step by step explanation suitable for newcomers to anatomy of how the brains of apes and humans are fundamentally similar, with particular reference to both having a posterior lobe, a posterior horn, and a hippocampus minor. The chapter concludes that this close similarity between apes and mankind proves that the original definition by Linnaeus of the biological Order of Primates was correct to include both, and mentions that an explanation of humans originating from apes is provided by Darwin's theory. The book also includes six pages of small print giving \\"a succinct History of the Controversy respecting the Cerebral Structure of Man and the Apes\\" describing how Owen had \\"suppressed\\" and denied what Huxley had now shown to be the truth regarding the hippocampus minor, posterior horn, and posterior lobe, describing this as reflecting on Owen's \\"personal veracity\\". Reviewers regarded the book as a polemic against Owen, and a majority of them sided with Huxley. Lyell's book included an illustration showing the distorted image of a chimpanzee brain used by Owen, and a correct view by another anatomist showing the projection of the occipital lobe at the rear which Owen said was not present in apes. Sir Charles Lyell's authoritative Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man was also published in 1863, and included a detailed review of the hippocampus question which gave solid and unambiguous support to Huxley's arguments. In an attempt to refute Lyell's judgement, Owen again defended his classification scheme, introducing a new claim that the hippocampus minor was virtually absent in an \\"idiot\\". Then in 1866 Owen's book On the Anatomy of Vertebrates presented accurate brain illustrations. In a long footnote, Owen cited himself and the earlier literature to admit at last that in apes \\"all the homologous parts of the human cerebral organ exist\\". However, he still believed that this did not invalidate his classification of man in a separate subclass. He now claimed that the structures concerned ‚Äì the posterior lobe, the posterior horn, and the hippocampus minor ‚Äì were in apes only \\"under modified form and low grades of development\\". He accused Huxley and his allies of making \\"puerile\\", \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"disgraceful\\" attacks on his scheme of classification. The publicity surrounding the affair tarnished Owen's reputation. While Owen had a laudable aim of finding an objective way of defining the uniqueness of humanity and distinguishing their brain anatomy in a qualitative way, not just a quantitative way, his obstinacy in refusing to admit his errors in trying to find that difference led to his fall from the pinnacle of British science. Huxley gained influence, and his X Club of like minded scientists used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science. Even many of his supporters, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that though humans shared a common ancestor with apes, the higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process. Darwin published his own explanation in 1871 in the Descent of Man. Modern relevance In a talk about biological systematics (classification) and cladistics given at the American Museum of Natural History in 1981, the paleontologist Colin Patterson discussed an argument put in a paper by Ernst Mayr that humans could be distinguished from apes by the presence of Broca's area in the brain. Patterson commented that this reminded him of \\"The Great Hippocampus Question\\" as recorded in fiction by Kingsley, and as in fact being a controversy between Huxley and Owen that \\"eventually as usual, Huxley won.\\" Notes References   Further reading (subscription required) Category:History of evolutionary biology Category:Evolutionary biology literature Category:Parodies Category:Scientific controversies Category:19th-century controversies ","title":"Great Hippocampus Question"},{"id":"24990960","title":"List of cities in Gujarat by population"},{"id":"24990983","text":"All Hallows Parish, Maryland may refer to: * All Hallows Parish, South River, Anne Arundel County, Maryland: All Hallows Church, South River * All Hallows Parish, Snow Hill, Worcester County, Maryland: All Hallows Episcopal Church ","title":"All Hallows Parish, Maryland"},{"id":"24990995","text":"Ludwig-Wilhelm Tepper de Ferguson (Lewis-William Ferguson-Tepper, Tepper von Ferguson, Louis-Guillaume Tepper de Ferguson; 18 December 1768, Warsaw ‚Äì 12 September 1838, Paris) was a Polish‚ÄìRussian musician and composer, a music teacher mainly associated with the Imperial Lyc√©e in Tsarskoye Selo (near St Petersburg, Russia). Biography Origin of the family Ludwig-Wilhelm Tepper de Ferguson was born in Warsaw as the sixth child and third son of the extremely wealthy Polish banker Piotr Fergusson Tepper and his wife Maria- Philipina, n√©e Valentin d'Hauterive. The surname 'Ferguson' indicates the Scottish origin of the family. Indeed, in 1703, his grandfather William Ferguson of Inverurie had emigrated from Scotland to Poland.Fischer, Th. A. The Scots in Germany. Being a contribution towards the history of the Scot abroad, 1902. Campbell, Lock. Ferguson of Inverurie: Ferguson-Tepper. Notes And Queries. S.III. 24 June 1911. p.489. In 1714, William Ferguson married Katherina-Concordia Tepper, a sister of the wealthy and influential merchant and banker, furrier and fur trader Pjotr Tepper of Poznan. Pjotr Tepper managed the large-scale international trade using family connections, and imported goods to Poland from many countries, including Britain.Smolenski, Wladislaw. Miezczanstwo warszawskie w koncu XVIII w. Warszawa, 1976. p..79. William Ferguson and Katherina-Concordia had three sons. One of them, Peter (1732‚Äì1794), who would become Ludwig-Wilhelm's father, entered into partnership with his maternal uncle Pjotr Tepper. In 1767 he was officially adopted by Pjotr Tepper on the condition he would add the name Tepper to his name Ferguson. In 1779, the Scottish origin of Peter Ferguson Tepper was recognised and confirmed in England, in consequence of which the Scottish and Polish branches of the family re-established relations. According to a column of James Boswell in a later issue of The Scots Magazine (1786): \\"In June 1779, he [Peter Ferguson-Tepper] had his arms matriculated in the Herald Office, London, and obtained permission to use the surname and arms of Tepper jointly with the surname and arms of Ferguson.The Scots Magazine, Vol.41, 1779. P.341 The father's writings being destroyed during the civil war in Poland, the son did not know from what part of Scotland his father came; and his Scots relations, not having heard from Poland for near fifty years, believed their friend in that country had died without issue; but the above paragraph in our Magazine caused them to make inquiry, when with equal joy they discovered other; and in a few months thereafter, Mr Ferguson Tepper came to Edinburgh to see them./.../Mr Peter Ferguson Tepper, of Warsaw is supposed to be the second banker in Europe.

The 1770s‚Äì1780s were the time of their prosperity. The Tepper bank had partners in Holland, Italy, and Russia and undertook large-scale international financial operations. Among their clients were Russian aristocrats and the Polish King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, whose army they financed. The splendid Tepper Palace in Warsaw was depicted in 1770 by Bernardo Bellotto. In 1777, Piotr Fergusson-Tepper became Treasurer and Agent of the Maltese Order.Pininsky, Peter. The Stuart's Last Secret. p.65; The Scottish Antiquary, or, Northern Notes and Queries. 1889. In 1787, the Teppers entertained King Stanislaw-August Poniatowski in their county estate Falenty.Rogowski, Wojciech. Fergusson-Tepper‚Äôs Falenty: the episode of free banking in Poland in the 18th century Recent research has revealed the participation of the Teppers in Scottish politics of the time: after the death of Princess Charlotte (1753‚Äì1789), the illegitimate daughter of Charles Edward Stuart (1720‚Äì1788), the last Scottish Pretender for the English throne), the Teppers acted as guardians for her children.Pininski, Peter, The Stuarts' Last Secret. Tuckwell Press, 2001. Corp, Edward (ed.), The Stuart Court in Rome: The Legacy of Exile. 2003. In the 1790s, the Teppers were granted the rank of Polish Nobility. Along with his brothers and sisters, Ludwig-Wilhelm spent his early years in the splendour of his parents' palaces. He was an infant prodigy, and started to play the clavecin at the age of six; at ten he composed music and gave public concerts. His father, however, intended him for law and diplomacy, and in 1781 sent him (together with two of his brothers) to study at the Military Academy of Duke Carl-Eugen in Stuttgart, where he resented the poor quality of music instruction.For his lively sketch of his two Stuttgart years, see Emile Longin, \\"Souvenirs d'un pensionnaire de l'Acad√©mie Caroline de Stuttgart (1781‚Äì1783)\\", Bulletin et M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© d‚Äô√âmulation de Montb√©liard, n¬∞ 70 (1914), pp.215‚Äì237.

His \\"Farewell Song\\" is traditionally performed annually at the Museum of the Pushkin Lyc√©e in Tsarskoe Selo on 19 October (the anniversary of the inauguration of the Lyc√©e in 1811). Music scores of Tepper's compositions have been preserved in the music libraries of St. Petersburg, Hamburg, Vienna, Weimar, etc. * An die Freude.

This art movement bridges historical, tribally-specific pictorial painting and carving practices towards an intertribal Modernist style of easel painting. This style is also influenced by the art programs of Chilocco Indian School, north of Ponca City, Oklahoma, and Haskell Indian Industrial Training Institute, in Lawrence, Kansas and features a mix of Southeastern, Prairie, and Central Plains tribes. History The Oklahoma and New Mexico Native American art movements in the first half of the 1900s share similar traits that define the Native American art market, including patronage, mentoring, community-based collectives, and new structures of support through education and museums. The Bacone school art movement was influenced by the Bacone College, as well as art programs of Chilocco Indian School, and Haskell Indian Industrial Training Institute, all of which were located in a similar geographic region. Tribes from the Southeastern, Prairie, and Central Plains regions each have their own historical practices of pictorial representation, whether in carving or painting; however, removal to Indian Territory in the 19th century disrupted many customary art practices. Access to Western art materials (such as easels, watercolors) gave Native artists a new means of self-expression, as well as a new way of recording history and daily practices.  \\"Flatstyle\\"  The Bacone style differs from the two other prevalent flat styles of Native American painting in Oklahoma of the time: Kiowa style and the Studio style. The \\"Flatstyle\\" painting, was in part made popular in the 1920s by the Kiowa style (also known as Southern Plains style) of painting by the Kiowa Six, this was rooting in the teachings by Oscar Jacobson at the School of Art at the University of Oklahoma (OU) where he served as Director from 1915 to 1945. However the Bacone style was specifically different from the Kiowa style because it had brighter colors, more movement and action, and visual perspective. The Southern Plains style had its origins in Plains hide painting and winter counts. After the decline of buffalo herds in the late 19th century, Plains painting shifted to Ledger art, which, under the stewardship of such artists as Silver Horn (1860/1‚Äì1940, Kiowa), evolved into easel art. The Studio style, as taught at the Santa Fe Indian School, first by Dorothy Dunn followed by Ger√≥nima Cruz Montoya (Ohkay Owingeh), built upon the accomplishments of the San Ildefonso school of painters and Hopi painters such as Fred Kabotie, who were successful \\"Flatstyle\\" easel artists in the 1910s and 1920s in Arizona and New Mexico. These artists were inspired by Pueblo mural painting and pottery painting traditions. Their work often features pastoral scenes in muted colors. Collectively, these three Flatstyle movements were sometimes derided by Native artists in the 1960s as \\"Bambi Art,\\" which has been criticized as nostalgic, sentimental, and limited in scope.Morand et al. 105  Bacone College influence  Acee Blue Eagle was a student at Chilocco Indian School and a student of Oscar Jacobson's at OU, Blue Eagle helped shape the Bacone style. Blue Eagle, being Muscogee Creek, Pawnee, and Wichita, used Southeastern Woodland and Central Plains influences in his work, which frequently portrayed cultural or historic information about his tribes in a stylized, narrative form. The first Bacone College's art department director was musician/storyteller, Mary \\"Ataloa\\" Stone McLendon from 1932 until 1935, she had built the structure that later became an early classroom for the art department (and is now named the Ataloa Lodge Museum). She was followed by Blue Eagle serving as the second director from 1935 to 1939. Woody Crumbo (Potawatomi) succeeded him in 1938.Silberman 86 1938 is the year artist Ruthe Blalock Jones (Shawnee/Delaware/Peoria) gives for the establishment of the Bacone School of Indian painting,Wyckoff 55 while some would give the year 1935.Parker, Gerri. \\"Native American Art in Oklahoma: The Kiowa and Bacone Artists.\\" DeAnza College. 27 July 2004 (retrieved 8 Nov 2009) Style and media Both Blue Eagle's and Crumbo's styles were also influenced by the streamlined, bold look of Art Deco. Casein on illustration board was a popular medium, as well as gouache and watercolor. Technical skill in draftsmanship was emphasized, as was the ethnographic accuracy of subjects portrayed. Paintings were aesthetically pleasing, with contours of a certain hue often surrounded by outlines of lighter tints, to emphasize the spiritual nature of the subject. Figures were brilliantly colored with backgrounds of a \\"subdued palettes of greens, blues, and browns,\\" as Ruthe Blalock Jones writes.Wyckoff 54 Blue, in particular, is a color representing sorrow, loss, and memory for some Southeastern tribes, and is often a preferred background color. Implied narrative gave the Bacone style a sense of drama. Development The Philbrook Museum of Art of Tulsa, Oklahoma helped foster the development of the Bacone style with its Indian Annual competitive art show from 1947 to 1957.Wyckoff 40 The Five Civilized Tribes Museum of Muskogee, Oklahoma and the Cherokee Heritage Center of Park Hill, Oklahoma both host annual arts shows with categories specifically for this style of art (the Cecil Dick award and the Jerome Tiger award, respectively).

Building Two Reno architects were hired to design this 16,600 dollar building, C.D. McDonald and J.J. Beatty. Friedhoff and Hoeffel, two Reno contractors, constructed this two-and-a-half story building to accommodate one hundred children. The bottom floor is made of rusticated concrete blocks, providing a foundation for the main body of the school. The face of the building is quite elaborate, with two balanced pedimented gables over two projecting bays, and a smaller gable over the main entrance. In 1935, this structure was enlarged according to plans created by Delongchamps, preserving the look of the building. This structure continued serving to function of Yerington's elementary school until 1980.

Release and Reception While not a chart success ‚ÄúMiles of Eyes‚Äù was considered a ‚Äòturntable hit‚Äô due to its incessant airplay on Irish radio for five weeks. And though it was not initially a substantial help to Jimmy's popularity it was favoured in retrospect by Irish music critics years later when he gained acknowledgement as a songwriter for other artists. In 1988 ‚ÄúMiles of Eyes‚Äù was covered as a single by Linda Martin and performed on the RTE programme ‚ÄúLive at Three‚Äù to renewed recognition .

Corrective maintenance is a maintenance task performed to identify, isolate, and rectify a fault so that the failed equipment, machine, or system can be restored to an operational condition within the tolerances or limits established for in-service operations.MIL-STD-3034 Reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) Process .  Definition  A French official standard defines \\"corrective maintenance\\" as maintenance which is carried out after failure detection and is aimed at restoring an asset to a condition in which it can perform its intended function (NF EN 13306 X 60-319 standard, June 2010).\\"Maintenance ex√©cut√©e apr√®s d√©tection d'une panne et destin√©e √† remettre un bien dans un √©tat dans lequel il peut accomplir une fonction requise.\\" Corrective maintenance can be subdivided into \\"immediate corrective maintenance\\" (in which work starts immediately after a failure) and \\"deferred corrective maintenance\\" (in which work is delayed in conformance to a given set of maintenance rules).  Standards  The technical standards concerning corrective maintenance are set by IEC 60050 chapter 191 ¬∞Dependability and quality of service\\" The NF EN 13306 X 60-319 is a subset of IEC 60050-191.  Choice  The decision to choose corrective maintenance as a method of maintenance is a decision depending on several factors as the cost of downtime, reliability characteristics and redundancy of assets.  Methods  The steps of corrective maintenance are, following failure, diagnosis ‚Äì elimination of the part, causing the failure ‚Äì ordering the replacement ‚Äì replacement of the part ‚Äì test of function and finally the continuation of use. The basic form of corrective maintenance is a step-by-step procedure. The object's failure triggers the steps. Modern technologies as the use of Industry 4.0 features reduce the inherant drawbacks of corrective maintenance. by e.g. providing device history, fault patterns, repair advice or availability of spare parts.

Tables are designed using 3D models found within the editor, and rendered using a 3D real-time engine. Pinball table layout, graphic design, and audio are provided by users during the construction and development of table design. Future Pinball allows users to create original tables based upon a default table which only contains flippers, slingshots, shooter lane, and shooter. Additional playfield components are added from a library containing surface, guide, objects, rubber, targets, lights, triggers, ramps, and displays. User created artwork can be added to the playfield, plastics, and backglass translite. Game coding is required, and is accomplished through Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting (VBS) via an embedded script editor.

Geography Kainaliu is located in the Kona district at coordinates, along the Hawaii Belt Road, also called the MƒÅmalahoa Highway or state route 11. For demographic information, see the census-designated places of Honalo, Hawaii to the north or Kealakekua, Hawaii to the south. History The town was named for an ancient canoe bailer who worked for King Keawenuiaumi in the sixteenth century, from kƒÅ i nƒÅ liu in the Hawaiian language. It was also the site of an early coffee farm of Governor Kuakini. The historic Lanakila Congregational church was built here in 1865‚àí67. Its founder Rev. John Davis Paris (1809‚Äì1892) and his family are buried in the cemetery. The church was built on the land of William Johnson, who would marry the grandnephew of Isaac Davis, and have a daughter who married the son of Rev. Paris, and another who married wealthy businessman William Herbert Shipman. In 1868, the self-proclaimed prophet Joseph Kaona convinced a band of followers the world would soon end. They tried to take over Lanikila church, then formed a communal camp on the beach. After the loss of two lives, they were captured and briefly imprisoned. In 1932 the Tanimoto Theater opened here, showing both American and Japanese films for workers in the Kona coffee industry. It was designed by William Harold Lee, and seated 325. After World War II the name was to Aloha Theater. It was shut down in the 1970s, but restored and re-opened, playing mostly live events. It is the oldest theater in Kona that is still operating. The theater now houses a restaurant and since 2003 has been the home of the Aloha Performing Arts Company. The Kona Research Station of the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources of the University of Hawaii is located here. Although a trail originally led to a small settlement at the beach, the road was moved uphill to accommodate the growing traffic through the coffee- producing region. The two-lane road is now often congested, resulting in what locals call the \\"Kainaliu crawl\\". An attempt to open a bypass highway in 2000 was stalled by lawsuits, but a portion was opened in 2009. The legal challenge to the rest of the new highway had risen to the Supreme Court of Hawaii. The road was a condition of the H≈çk≈´lia development of a golf course and vacation home development near the shoreline.

Aach's painting style is known for its intense and well placed pigmentation, which stemmed from his deep interest in color theory and color relationships. This interest in color theory and philosophy would lead him to write one of the most notable translations of Goethe's Color Theory. Personal life and teaching Herb Aach was born in Cologne, Germany in 1923. It was in Germany where Aach would be exposed to fine art, studying under German expressionist painter Ludwig Meidner. Nazi persecution caused his family to flee, and in 1938 he arrived in New York City. In 1942 he enlisted in the United States Army and a year later he became a U.S. citizen. After serving during World War II, in Kassel, Germany, he returned to New York in 1946 where he studied under John Ferren and Rufino Tamayo at the Brooklyn Museum Art School. In 1948 he moved, with his new wife, to Mexico City where he continued his fine art studies at Escuela de Pintura y Escultura. Upon returning from Mexico, Aach would practice painting in what was described as \\"relative isolation,\\" between 1954‚Äì1963 in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. He would eventually move back to New York City in 1963 and began teaching at Queens College in 1965, where he would continue to teach for the rest of his life. At Queens he taught studio art and color theory and became a favorite of students, gaining tribute in the 1968 school yearbook and voted twice as \\"Teacher of the Year\\". He would serve as chairman of the arts department from 1976‚Äì1979. He also taught at the Pratt Institute from 1966‚Äì1969. In the 1970s Aach visited East Germany to participate in the International Research and Exchanges Board outreach program to broaden cultural exchanges between the West. While in East Germany he studied at the Goethe archives in Weimar and became interested in rose windows. Back in New York, he worked with city officials to paint city bridges bright colors, such as the Madison Avenue Bridge which was painted lavender. He became president of the Artists Technical Research Institute in 1975. In 1979 he was diagnosed with cancer and due to illness he became unable to paint, taking up drawing as his main format. He died October 13, 1985 of cancer at the Memorial Sloan‚ÄìKettering Cancer Center. Career Painting Aach's early professional career was heavily inspired by the work of John Ferren and his ideas regarding color theory. Upon returning to the United States from Mexico, Aach explored his ideas about color execution in painting, where he developed the color expressionism style. This style formed out of his time developing paint at Art Crayon Company, which provided him access to pigments rarely accessible for public use and allowed him to experiment with newly developed pigmentation which he added to his own paints. He was also provided new pigments by DuPont and by the mid-1960s he began using fluorescent paints to achieve what has been described as \\"intensity and inner light\\". In the mid-1960s he moved from creating lush brushstrokes to creating larger areas of color upon the canvas allowing him to seek a \\"purer framework in which to explore color relationships.\\" His estate describes the importance of color relationships in his art: > Color relationships were central, built on innate physiological > predispositions, and color was therefore too important to waste as a mere > \\"label\\" for establishing objectural references. color wheel In 1974 he created the body of work Precession of Equinoxes. In this series Aach started with covering canvas in thin layers of gesso, inspired by Giotto's fresco-like surfaces. After laying the groundwork for his canvas, he painted sharp lines between color regions and used his signature fluorescent colors. Even with a use of hard lines, Aach believed his use of color overpowered the placement and appearance of the lines. Art critic Noel Frackman described the series as \\"handsome, uncomplicated paintings\\". Writing Inspired by his interest in color theory, in 1971 Aach edited and translated Goethe's Theory of Colours. He also contributed articles about color theory and practice and reviews to various arts publications. Reception Louis Finkelstein described Aach's work as being heavily \\"located in cultural tradition\\" in relation to his influences, those he influenced, and the skills and styles of Irish manuscripts, textiles, Chinese and Colombian art. In 1974 art critic Noel Frackman declared Aach a pioneer.

Early years Born in Glasgow, \\"K.J.\\" (as he was known to his friends) was educated at a local high school before leaving at the age of sixteen to start a career in journalism. He worked as a reporter and sub-editor for local newspapers, including The News and the Evening News. Moving south in the late 1880s, he worked for papers in Leicester and Birmingham before moving to London in search of employment there. Though his contribution to starting a new newspaper, The Evening, in 1892 proved futile, he remained convinced that a halfpenny morning daily would be economically viable.Dilwyn Porter, \\"Jones, (William) Kennedy\\", in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, H.C.G. Matthew and Brian Harrison, eds. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), vol. 30, p. 577. Work with Northcliffe After working for a time for The Sun as chief sub-editor, in 1894 he took a gamble along with The Sun's assistant editor, Louis Tracy and acquired an option to purchase the Evening News. Though enjoying a circulation of 100,000, the newspaper was running at a loss, and Jones and Tracy both hoped to sell the paper quickly to Alfred Harmsworth, who was looking to purchase his first London daily. In August the three signed an agreement in which Jones and Tracey each received 7¬Ω percent of the profits generated by the newspaper. Jones soon took over as editor, remaking the paper with new typography and a greater emphasis on sports coverage, competitions, serialized fiction, and attention-grabbing feature articles, at which Jones excelled. This was a new style of journalism which proved enormously profitable.J. Lee Thompson, Northcliffe: Press Baron in Politics, 1865‚Äì1922 (London: John Murray, 2000), pgs. 22-23. Jones's gruff, abrasive manner soon helped established him as Harmsworth's business manager, and Harmsworth gave him considerable freedom in making decisions. In 1895 Jones acquired the Glasgow Daily Record, as part of a plan to acquire a chain of provincial dailies. This plan was abandoned the following year with the launch of the Daily Mail, which embodied Jones' vision of an halfpenny paper marketed to the middle class and produced in London for a nationwide market. Though not the editor, Jones was in charge of the style and content, and his instinct for what his readers wanted helped make the Daily Mail a runaway success, growing from an initial planned run of 100,000 to over 500,000 copies in circulation within three years of its launch.http://www.conradfirst.net/view/periodical?id=28 Though he seemed to enjoy his hard-nosed reputation as Harmsworth's business manager, Jones was capable of acting with more subtlety, as he did in 1908 when he served as an intermediary for Harmsworth's ultimately successful negotiations to purchase The Times. Though Jones introduced many of his innovations, he was not elected to the paper's board of directors and was denied the editorial influence he expected. After an intestinal operation in 1912, Jones sold his shares in the newspapers at a handsome profit, retaining a chairmanship of Waring & Gillow until 1914.History of the Times, vol. IV, The 150th Anniversary and Beyond, 1912‚Äì1948 (London: Printing House Square, 1952), pgs. 124-126. Later years Having retired from business, Jones turned to politics. He ran as an independent in a 1916 by-election for Wimbledon, enjoying a protest vote against the prevailing wartime party truce but ultimately losing the seat to Stuart Coats. A few months later, he ran unopposed as a Unionist in a by- election for Hornsey. He worked for the Ministry of Food in 1917 and demonstrated an interest in London's transport issues. He founded The East Finchley Constitutional Club which is still open. He was a member of the Sylvan Debating Club. He died of pneumonia in October 1921.Porter, op cit, p. 578.

There is reluctance among some organizations to label events as honor killings to avoid stigmatizing Muslim and Arab cultures. Circa 2017 City University of New York John Jay College College of Criminal Justice professor Ric Curtis lead a team that analyzed honor killing statistics from Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom and made a proxy estimate for the United States based on that, resulting in an estimated 23-27 annual honor killings in the U.S. In 2017 Jesse Singal of New York Magazine wrote \\"there‚Äôs effectively no evidence that honor killings are common at all, according to one of the only (if not the only) studies attempting to estimate how prevalent that crime is.\\" Executive Order 13769 \\"Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States\\" stated that the U.S. federal government would collect information on honor killings committed by foreigners resident in the U.S.; Singal stated that the lack of prevalance of honor crimes in the U.S. \\"makes the language of Trump‚Äôs EO odd\\". In 2015 senior fellow of Center for Advanced Studies on Terrorism Farhana Qazi stated that the actual number of honor killings was higher than the reported statistics due to a reluctance to embarrass relatives of the deceased. In 2012 Zuhdi Jasser of the think tank American Islamic Forum for Democracy argued that honor killings were a phenomenon in the U.S. that need to be investigated. Instances Palestina Isa In 1989 in St. Louis, Missouri, sixteen-year-old Palestina (Tina) Isa was murdered by her Palestinian father, Zein Isa, with the aid of her Brazilian mother, Maria Isa. Their daughter listened to American popular music such as dance, rap, R&B;, and rock. After learning that Palestina had taken a part-time job without her parents' permission, and dated an African American man, her father felt she had become too modernized. On the day of her murder, Zein repeatedly stabbed his daughter Tina, while her mother Maria held her down. On December 20, 1991 both Zein and Maria Isa were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. He later died of diabetes complications on February 17, 1997. Maria's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment without parole; she died on April 30, 2014, in a Vandalia, Missouri, prison at the age of 70. Amina and Sarah Said Amina and Sarah Said were the children of Egyptian immigrant Yaser Abdel Said and American Patricia \\"Tissie\\" Owens. Both girls were born in Dallas, Texas, Amina on March 2, 1989, and Sarah on March 16, 1990. The girls were found shot to death in a taxi at the Omni Mandalay Hotel in Irving, Texas, on January 1, 2008. Both girls had left their home in Lewisville, Texas, earlier that evening, with their father Yaser Said. At 7:33 pm CT a call came into the Irving Police Department's 911 call center. The call was from Sarah Said. She had been shot nine times and told the operator, \\"My dad shot me and my sister. I'm dying!\\" Their mother, Patricia Said, claims that both girls were killed for having non-Muslim boyfriends. Death threats had been made by Yaser against the girls. They ran away and were safe, but their mother brought them back. Yaser Said was an FBI Top Ten Fugitive until his capture in 2020, the FBI was offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Said has been featured on America's Most Wanted as well as on a Fox News special about honor killings in America; he was also on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. Yaser Abdel Said was captured on August 26, 2020, aged 63. He had been on the run for over twelve years up until then. Sandeela Kanwal In July 2008, New York Post writer John P. Avlon claimed that the murder of 25-year-old Sandeela Kanwal-- by her father, Chaudhry Rashid--was an \\"American Honor Killing.\\" Rashid strangled Kanwal to death with a bungee cord after she tried to end her arranged marriage. Chaudhry Rashid was then sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Aasiya Zubair In February 2009, Muzzammil Hassan was arrested and charged with murdering his estranged wife Aasiya Zubair with a knife and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. The Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Islamic Society of North America responded with an \\"Open Letter to Muslim Leaders\\", expressing shock and sadness at the murder, condemning domestic violence, and calling on imams and Muslim leaders to \\"provide support and help to protect the victims of domestic violence\\" and \\"to never second-guess a woman who comes to us indicating that she feels her life to be in danger.\\" Imam Mohamed Hagmagid Ali, vice-president of ISNA, stated: \\"This is a wake up call to all of us, that violence against women is real and cannot be ignored. It must be addressed collectively by every member of our community.\\" Noor Almaleki Faleh Hassan Almaleki, an Iraqi immigrant, used his vehicle to strike and kill his daughter Noor Almaleki (aged 20) in a Phoenix valley parking lot in October 2009; he also severely injured her boyfriend's mother, Amal Khalaf. Police said Almaleki told detectives and witnesses after the October 2009 incident that he was angry at his daughter because she was \\"too Westernized,\\" defying Iraqi and Muslim values. Noor had shunned an arranged marriage to a first cousin in Iraq, and was living with her boyfriend and his mother, police said. Earlier, she had insisted on driving and crashed the family van. County prosecutor Laura Reckart said an enraged Almaleki hid in the parking lot waiting for her and her boyfriend's mother and then \\"revved and raced that car right into them.\\" Following his daughter's death, Almaleki fled to Mexico and later to London, where he was taken into custody upon his arrival. After four days of deliberation, the six-man, six-woman jury at Maricopa County Superior Court convicted him of second-degree murder. The jury also convicted him of aggravated assault for crashing his vehicle into Khalaf, and two further counts of hit and run. Subsequently, Almaleki was sentenced to 34 ¬Ω years in prison. Gelareh Bagherzadeh and Coty Beavers Jordanian-American Ali Mahmood Awad Irsan was sentenced to death in a Texas court on August 14, 2018 for the murders of Gelareh Bagherzadeh and Coty Beavers in Greater Houston. Bagherzadeh, an Iranian-American, had encouraged Irsan's daughter Nesreen to renounce Islam and to convert to Evangelical Christianity. Coty Beavers, who was also an Evangelical Christian, was Nesreen's husband. American Muslim community response Leaders of the American Muslim community have condemned the practice. Members of the Council on American-Islamic Relations have condemned all honor killings as well as specific incidents. Many Muslim leaders in the US say that Islam does not promote honor killings and that the practice stems from sexism and tribal behavior that predates the religion. \\"You're always going to get problems with chauvinism and suppressing vulnerable populations and gender discrimination,\\" says Salam Al-Marayati, executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council. In February 2009, after the high-profile killing of Aasiya Zubair, Muslim leaders began a nationwide, unified effort entitled \\"Imams Speak Out: Domestic Violence Will Not Be Tolerated in Our Communities,\\" asking all imams and religious leaders to discuss domestic violence in their weekly sermon or their Friday prayer services. The group, \\"Muslim Men Against Domestic Violence\\", was founded soon after the murder.

Amnesty International USA stated that the murder was in headlines across the United States \\"because it happened in Arizona\\" instead of a faraway foreign country. Background Her father, Faleh Hassan Almaleki, originated from Basra, Iraq. The family, which left Iraq when Noor was four, moved to the Phoenix area in the mid-1990s. Almaleki and her family lived in Glendale, Arizona and later in the Paradise Views subdivision of Phoenix. She attended Dysart High School in El Mirage. Before the crime occurred, Faleh received his U.S. citizenship and Noor had graduated from high school. Before her death she attended Glendale Community College. She began having conflicts with her parents over her lifestyle and dress. Her father had her go to Iraq to marry an older cousin, but she flew back to Arizona in 2008 and began dating someone of her own choosing. Abigail Pesta, the editor-at-large of Marie Claire, wrote \\"It's unclear whether a wedding actually took place.\\" In the spring of 2009 she moved into her own apartment but lost income when her family members turned up at her places of employment, and she went back to her family's house. In June 2009 she moved into the household of other Iraqi Americans, former friends of the family. She developed a romance with the son of the family, making her own family upset. Pesta stated that \\"Noor filed for a restraining order, but seems never to have finalized the paperwork.\\" Paul Rubin, in the Riverfront Times, wrote \\"From their perspective, a man's daughters are his property, and they are supposed to live with him until he decides otherwise.\\" Crime and arrest On October 20, 2009 she was assisting her boyfriend's mother with translation matters, at an office of the Arizona Department of Economic Security, in Peoria. Outside of the office, Faleh struck the two with his vehicle. As a result her brain bled and was injured, even though the skull never fractured, and portions of her body were paralyzed. The collision also injured the other woman, to the point where her pelvis was fractured. Faleh did not stop and render aid, nor did he call for emergency help. At the hospital doctors performed surgery on Noor's spine, and police officers were assigned to guard her. The authorities did not reveal to her family where she was, fearing that her mother or siblings may try to kill her. Noor was put in a coma. Pesta wrote \\"police records indicate that her family tried to help her father flee abroad.\\" Faleh drove to Mexico, left his car in the city of Nogales, and then boarded an airline flight to London from Mexico City. The UK Border Agency did not allow Faleh to enter the UK, and he was arrested after British authorities returned him to the United States. A urinary tract infection spread to her heart. Maricopa County medical examiner Dr. Kevin Horn stated that it was the infection, and not the direct injuries from the collision, which caused Almaleki's death. On November 2, she experienced brain death and her life support was disconnected.  Criminal penalty and aftermath  The trial began on January 24, 2011. Faleh's lawyers stated in his trial that while he indeed hit the two women with his car, he did not intend to kill them, and therefore was guilty of second degree murder. Prosecutors attempted to get a first degree murder conviction, but did not seek capital punishment against Faleh. Faleh was convicted of second degree murder on February 22, 2011. The jury did not find that the act was premeditated. In April 2011, Faleh was sentenced, at age 50, on multiple counts: for murdering his daughter he was sentenced to 16 years, for injuring her boyfriend's mother he received 15 years, and for leaving the scene of a crime without permission he received three and one half years. Because they are to be served consecutively, Faleh received a total of 34 and one half years in prison as his penalty. A friend established a Facebook group in her honor; by 2010 its membership was about 4,000. 48 Hours had an episode about this crime.

Her abstract and figurative work were also influenced by her time spent in Saint Croix and Haiti, where she lived off and on throughout the 1950s.  Early life and education  Abbott was born in New York City, where she attended the Chapin School. Her family lineage traces back to John Adams, the second president of the United States. Her mother, Elizabeth Grinnell, was a poet and syndicated columnist with Hearst newspapers. Her family would spend time in the summer in Southampton, New York in Long Island. She was a student of artist George Grosz, while attending the Art Students League of New York. At the experimental school, Subjects of the Artist, Abbott worked with Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, and David Hare. Abbott also studied in the late 1930s at the Corcoran Museum School (now known as Corcoran School of the Arts and Design) in Washington DC. She was briefly married to painter Lewis Teague from 1943 until 1946. Soon after her separation from Teague, she married businessman Tom Clyde. Clyde and Abbott spent many winters in Haiti and St.Croix. Here, she found many inspirations, such as the people and landscapes, that often inspired her paintings.  Career and later life  After World War II, Abbott began seriously pursuing a career the art world and she joined the \\"Downtown Group\\", which represented a group of artists who lived in lower Manhattan. In 1946, she set up an art studio on Tenth Street in Manhattan. Her location in Manhattan granted her access to a sort of inner circle of artists. Philip Pavia invited her to be one of the only three women included in \\"The Artist's Club\\" alongside Elaine de Kooning and Perle Fine. \\"Generally speaking the women at the Club weren't treated differently than anyone else -- an artist was an artist. Sometimes you might get treated like a girl because you were pretty. I was chosen to collect the dues and go buy the booze because I was pretty and the guys would pay up if I asked them to. Other times you had to be tough to be taken seriously,\\" Abbott said. In 1948-49, Willem de Kooning became influential in her artistic development. Their time spent together after he lectured at Subjects of the Artist, is cited as significant for her use of large-scale gesture. Abbott and de Kooning, alongside others including Jackson Pollock and Robert Motherwell, frequently visited the Cedar Street Tavern. This tavern is hailed as a famous meeting place for the Abstract Expressionist thinkers. Abbott has said that while there, they discussed ideas, art, and philosophy. In the 1950s, Abbott began a collaborative project between herself and Barbara Guest. Guest, a first- generation poet at the New York School. Abbott made paintings she called \\"poetry paintings\\" that were directly inspired by the words and images associated with Guest's poetry. Her paintings feature bright colors and were inspired by nature and her time spent traveling in the Caribbean islands with her husband. She died at age 98 on August 23, 2019 of heart failure.

Jeff Thompson was a cotton-clad sidewheel ram of the Confederate Navy during the American Civil War. The ship was selected in January 1862 by Captain James E. Montgomery to be part of his River Defense Fleet. At New Orleans on 25 January, Capt. Montgomery began to convert her into a cottonclad ram by placing a oak sheath with a iron covering on her bow, and by installing double pine bulkheads filled with compressed cotton bales. Service history Battle of Plum Point Bend When General M. Jeff Thompsons conversion was completed on 11 April, she steamed to Fort Pillow, Tennessee, where she operated in defense of the river approaches to Memphis. On 10 May 1862, General M. Jeff Thompson, in company with seven other vessels of Montgomery's fleet, attacked the ironclad gunboats of the Federal Mississippi Flotilla. The Battle of Plum Point Bend which followed witnessed successful ramming tactics by the Confederates, but General M. Jeff Thompson, under Captain J. H. Burke, was not able to get into the battle except with her guns. These she manned coolly and effectively despite the discouraging effect of heavy Union fire. Montgomery's force held off the Federal rams and gunboats until Fort Pillow was successfully evacuated on 1 June. Then the Confederate vessels fell back on Memphis to take on coal. Battle of Memphis Following the Federal capture of Fort Pillow, Flag Officer Charles Henry Davis, USN, commanding the Mississippi River Squadron pressed on without delay and appeared off Memphis with a superior force on 6 June 1862. Montgomery, unable to retreat to Vicksburg, Mississippi, because of his fuel shortage, and unwilling to destroy his boats, determined to fight against heavy odds. In the ensuing Battle of Memphis, General M. Jeff Thompson was heavily hit and set on fire by Union shells. She ran aground and was abandoned by her crew. She burned to the water's edge and her magazine blew up violently, strewing the shore with iron braces and fastenings, with charred remains of broken timbers, and leaving her wrecked remains half buried and half sunk.

Biography  Jean was the son of Gerard de Montagu and Biette de Cassinel or Biota Cassinelli (c. 1340 ‚Äì around 1380), called la belle Italienne (\\"the beautiful Italian woman\\"). She was the daughter of Fran√ßois Cassinel (died 1360), a sergeant in the Royal Army, and great-granddaughter of Bettino Cassinelli, who had immigrated from Italy to Paris. It was said that he was the illegitimate son of Charles V of France, but Merlet writes that Charles was only 12 or 13 at the time of Jean's birth. Jean had two brothers: G√©rard de Montagu the Younger (died 1420), who was bishop of Poitiers and bishop of Paris; and Jean de Montagu (killed 25 October 1415 at the Battle of Agincourt), who was bishop of Chartres, and archbishop of Sens. He made a career at the royal court, rising to become Grand Treasurer and Grand Master of France. Being the leading figure of the royal government during the period following the assassination of Louis, the Duke of Orl√©ans, in the ongoing Armagnac-Burgundian Civil War, he developed a very bitter rivalry with the Duke of Burgundy, John the Fearless, who sought to hold the Regency (and the income of the Royal Household) in place of the mentally incapable King Charles, as his father had done. In 1409, John the Fearless had him arrested with the help of the Provost of Paris during one of King Charles' mad spells. The Queen and the Duke of Berry, among several others, pleaded for his release to no avail. After an expedited summary trial where he unsuccessfully appealed to the then Burgundian- controlled Parliament a forced confession of treason and other charges upon being subjected to torture, Montagu was beheaded on 17 October 1409 in front of a large crowd in Paris, at the Gibbet of Montfaucon.

It originally operated from 1972 to 1978 at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. The roller coaster is a prefabricated model that features an electric spiral lift mechanism, and it was one of the earliest known coasters to use this lift mechanism.List of electric spiral lift roller coasters on RCDB.com Ride layout The Jumbo Jet, like all electric spiral lift roller coasters, reached the top of its lift hill by way of a gently-graded spiraling helix, before beginning its first drop. Unlike many roller coasters, which use a traditional chain lift, the Jumbo Jet was propelled with small wheel motors up the incline of the helix. These sort of coasters soon became a very common type of steel roller coaster in the 1970s, and were distinguished from later steel roller coaster designs that were characterized by their thicker, tubular-steel tracks. After climbing the spiral lift, riders plunge into a series of tight turns using a figure-eight pattern and ending with a double- helix. When it debuted, Jumbo Jet was billed as the fastest of its kind and was known for its views of Lake Erie and steeply banked turns (some at up to 70 degrees). History Jumbo Jet in July, 1973 Jumbo Jet was manufactured by notable roller coaster designer Anton Schwarzkopf, and was the first of the Jet Star 3 model in the Jumbo Jet line. The coaster was located in the same beachfront location where a wooden roller coaster called Cyclone once stood before.List of Cedar Point roller coasters It was also the location that housed the now-defunct Disaster Transport, an indoor roller coaster, as well as the location where GateKeeper stands presently.Map of Cedar Point, The Toledo Blade, May 26, 1972 While at Cedar Point, Jumbo Jet carried between 1.6 and 1.8 million passengers every year. Jumbo Jet was eventually replaced in 1979 by the new WildCat coaster. Although Jumbo Jet was only at Cedar Point for a short time, the roller coaster subsequently moved to a number of different amusement parks, including Palace Playland in Maine, Malm√∂ Folkets Park in Sweden, Beoland in Russia, Dreamland in Belarus, and its present location of Chelyuskintsev Park also located in Belarus.

The British launched an amphibious attack at the Humen strait (Bogue), capturing the forts on the islands of Chuenpi and Taikoktow. Subsequent negotiations between British Plenipotentiary Charles Elliot and Chinese Imperial Commissioner Qishan resulted in the Convention of Chuenpi on 20 January. As one of the terms of the agreement, Elliot announced the cession of Hong Kong Island to the British Empire, after which the British took formal possession of the island on 26 January.  Background  In September 1840, the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing dynasty fired Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu and replaced him with Qishan.The Chinese Repository, vol. 9, pp. 412‚Äì413 British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston instructed Plenipotentiary Charles Elliot to have the ports of Canton, Amoy, Fuzhou, Ningpo, and Shanghai opened for trade; to acquire the cession of at least one island (or if the Chinese refused, the establishment of a secure British enclave on the mainland); and to secure compensation for confiscated opium as well as military costs incurred in China.Hanes & Sanello 2004, p. 117Le Pichon 2006, p. 39 On 1 December, Elliot wrote to Palmerston that these demands would be secured within ten days. Three days after the deadline, Elliot wrote to Governor- General of India Lord Auckland that he had failed to get the concessions, but one was still in prospect. He then conceded that any settlement would be \\"far short of the demands of the government.\\"Fay 1997, p. 270 In negotiations with Qishan, Elliot wanted $7 million over a period of six years and the surrender of Amoy and Chusan as permanent British possessions. Qishan offered $5 million over twelve years, so they agreed to $6 million. However, Qishan refused Elliot's territorial demands. On 17 December, Elliot countered with an offer to abandon Chusan, which the British captured in July 1840, and for another port to be chosen later in its place. After Qishan rejected the offer, Elliot told him, \\"There are very large forces collected here, and delays must breed amongst them a very great impatience.\\"Hanes & Sanello 2004, p. 118 The year passed with no final settlements. An opium clipper that subsequently sailed into Canton brought with it a rumour that the emperor had decided to wage war. On 5January 1841, Elliot prepared for an attack on Canton, informing Qishan that an attack would commence in two days if agreement could not be reached. He allowed Commodore Gordon Bremer, commander-in-chief of the British forces, to make offensive operations.Mackenzie 1842, p. 14  Battle  British operations began at 8:00 am on 7January from Sampanchow Island, below the Humen strait (Bogue).The Chinese Repository, vol. 10, p. 37 By 9:00 am, the East India Company steamers Enterprise, Madagascar, and Nemesis assisted in embarking the following forces who landed unopposed below the Chuenpi Island artillery batteries: *504 Royal Marines under Captain Samuel Ellis *33 Royal Artillery under Captain J. Knowles, operating a 24-pounder howitzer and two 6-pounder field guns *137 seamen from the Wellesley, Blenheim, and Melville under Lieutenant Wilson *104 troops of the 26th and 49th Regiments under Major Johnstone *607 troops of the 37th Madras Native Infantry under Captain Duff *76 Bengal Volunteers under Captain Bolton An additional 30 seamen assisted in dragging the 24-pounder and two 6-pounders into position, and 15 sailors from the Blenheim were employed in the rocket and ammunition service. Major Thomas Pratt of the 26th Regiment commanded the land force of about 1,500 men.Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 227Hall & Bernard 1844, p. 119 After advancing , the British spotted the upper fort and an entrenchment comprising a deep ditch with surrounding breastwork. The Chinese cheered when they saw the British, waved their flags in defiance, and opened fire from the batteries. In response, the British cannons on the crest of the hill commenced firing. The Chinese then returned fire for about 20 minutes. The steamers Queen and Nemesis, under Captain Edward Belcher of the Sulphur, fired shells into the upper fort while the Calliope, Hyacinth, and Larne ships (under Captain Thomas Herbert) attacked the lower fort. In less than an hour, the combined bombardment silenced the Chinese batteries. By 10:00 am, the upper fort had been captured, and the lower fort surrounded and stormed by Royal Marines.Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, pp. 223‚Äì224 After the capture, the Nemesis attacked a fleet of about 15 war junks under Admiral Guan Tianpei in Anson's Bay. The junks mounted 7 to 11 guns of various calibre from 4- to 12-pounders.MacPherson 1843, p. 267The Nautical Magazine 1841, p. 415 The ship fired a Congreve rocket that struck a junk near the admiral, which a British officer described as follows: The Nemesis (right background) destroying Chinese war junks in Anson's Bay Nemesis and other British boats engaging Chinese junks at Chuenpi At about 11:30 am, the Chinese on board the junks hauled down their flags.Hall & Bernard 1844, p. 127 At noon, two cutters of the Nemesis sailed towards Admiral Guan's junk, described by an officer as \\"immensely large\\" and mounting 14 or 15 guns, some of them brass and \\"beautifully chased\\".The United Service Journal 1841, p. 242 They found only one man on board who after seeing the crew board the ship, jumped over the bow. Meanwhile, Captain James Scott of the Samarang commanded the attack on Taikoktow Island (west of Chuenpi). When the forts began firing on the British vessels at 10:20 am, the Samarang returned fire ten minutes later after anchoring away. The Modeste, Druid, and Columbine later anchored in succession. Scott reported that \\"in a few minutes, so destructive and well directed was the fire of our ships, that that of the enemy was silenced, with the exception of an occasional gun or two.\\"Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 232 At 11:20 am, the ships embarked their crewmen to storm the forts where the Chinese remained inside until driven out. The Chinese could not withstand the onslaught of British muskets during hand-to-hand combat. After capturing the forts, the Chinese guns were spiked and thrown into the river.The Chinese Repository, vol. 10, p. 41 In total, 38 British were wounded, many from an explosion of an extensive magazine after capturing the Chuenpi fort.Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 229 Commodore Bremer credited the Chinese for fighting \\"with the greatest credit and devotion\\" in the batteries and reported their losses at 500 to 600 out of a force of 2,000 men.Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 225 Chinese records indicate 744 casualties (277 killed and 467 wounded).Mao 2016, pp. 206‚Äì207 The high Chinese casualties were due to the impression they had that British troops would give no quarter.Ouchterlony 1844, p. 96 100 Chinese prisoners who laid down their arms were released the next day.Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 226 11 junks were destroyed Belcher 1843, p. 144 and 191 artillery pieces were captured.Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 243 According to Qing scholar Wei Yuan, Kuan sent Rear-Admiral Li T'ing-Y√º to Canton to request more troops, which the \\"whole official body\\" supported except Qishan, who spent the night writing peace proposals.Parker 1888, p. 25  Aftermath  Elliot sent a Chinese prisoner to Kuan, with a letter explaining \\"the usages of civilised warfare\\" and that if the forts did not hoist their colours the following day, they would not be attacked.Bingham 1843, p. 30 At 11:30 am on 8January, British ships led by the Blenheim sailed up the Bocca Tigris. As they approached Anunghoy Island (north of Chuenpi), a boat rowed by an old woman displayed a white flag.Mackenzie 1842, p. 25Ouchterlony 1844, pp. 100‚Äì101 A man from the ship was taken on board a British vessel to deliver a request from Kuan that hostilities be suspended for three days in order to contact Qishan.Mackenzie 1842, pp. 25‚Äì26MacPherson 1843, p. 72 Cancellation of the attack order prompted Lieutenant John Ouchterlony to note that it \\"certainly created a feeling of great disappointment throughout the fleet.\\" Elliot addressed the cancellation in a circular aboard the Wellesley: \\"A communication has been received from the Chinese commander-in-chief, which has led to an armistice, with the purpose to afford the high commissioner time to consider certain conditions now offered for his acceptance.\\"The Chinese Repository, vol. 11, p. 578 On 20January, after the Convention of Chuenpi, Elliot announced \\"the conclusion of preliminary arrangements\\" between Qishan and himself. They involved the cession of Hong Kong Island to the United Kingdom, a ¬£6 million indemnity payable to the British government, direct and equal ties between the countries, and trade in Canton to be opened within ten days following the Chinese new year.The Chinese Repository, vol. 10, p. 63 They also agreed to the restoration of Chuenpi and Taikoktow to the Chinese, and the evacuation of Chusan.Bulletins of State Intelligence 1841, p. 270 On 26 January, the Union Jack was raised on Hong Kong, and Commodore Bremer took formal possession of the island, under a feu de joie from the marines and a royal salute from the anchored men-of-war.Belcher 1843, p. 148 On 29January, Elliot proclaimed that Chinese natives \\"shall be governed according to the laws and customs of China, every description of torture excepted\\" and that \\"all British subjects and foreigners residing, or resorting to the island of Hongkong, shall enjoy full security and protection, according to the principles and practice of British law\\".The Chinese Repository, vol. 10, p. 64 When the news reached the emperor, he ordered Qishan to be \\"degraded from his office\\" and to stand trial at the Board of Punishments.Martin 1847, p. 66 Qishan faced several charges including giving \\"the barbarians Hongkong as a dwelling place\\".Davis 1852, p. 50 In his response, he claimed, \\"I pretended to do so from the mere force of circumstances, and to put them off for a time, but had no such serious intention.\\" The court denounced him as a traitor and sentenced him to death. He was imprisoned for several months, but at the end of 1841 he was allowed, without authority or rank, to deal with the British.Davis 1852, pp. 51‚Äì52 On 21April 1841, Lord Palmerston wrote a letter of reprimand to Elliot and recalled him for not securing the earlier demands as ordered. Palmerston dismissed Hong Kong as \\"a barren island with hardly a house upon it.\\"Le Pichon 2006, p. 40 In May 1841, Henry Pottinger replaced Elliot as plenipotentiary.

Arunachalam (4 March 1944 ‚Äì 21 January 2004) was an Indian politician and former Member of Parliament elected from Tamil Nadu. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from Tenkasi constituency as an Indian National Congress candidate in 1977, 1980, 1984, 1989 and 1991 elections and as a Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) candidate in 1996 election.  Early life  M.Arunachalam was born on 4 March 1944 to Mr.Moockiah and Mrs.Muthammal in Vellanaikottai village, in the district of Tirunelveli, southernmost part of India. It is a small village at the foot of western ghat region. The days when there was no electricity and traveling facilities as we have now, Arunachalam enjoyed life as a son of an agriculturist in the green fields enjoying nature in its unpolluted form, helping his parents in the fields, taking care of the crops and livestock. Swimming was his favourite hobby in which he excelled. He is the second son of a family of six children- having an elder brother, two younger brothers and two younger sisters and was the second graduate from his village after his elder brother. From childhood he experienced the social evils like untouchability, economical injustice, colour race and casteism all which gave him the determination to do something for the society and decided that politics is the only way by which he can serve his community. He suffered several humiliations during his life as a student, but he was firm and the sufferings he had undergone had strengthened his resolve to become somebody in the society. He made a strong decision to study well, convinced that education alone would unlock the doors of opportunities and pave way for advancement- for without knowledge and education, there can be no power. He finished his schooling in Pulliangudi and Vasudevanallur, walking 2‚Äì4 km daily. He did his pre-university course from V.O.Chidambram College Tuticorin, graduated from St.Xaviers college, Palayamkottai, had his post-graduation from Gandhigram University, Dindugul, and Bachelor of Law from Law College, Chennai. During(after his degree, post graduation and law college studies) the holidays Arunachalam did not want to sit idle so he worked in offices like National Small Savings Corporation and All India Radio, Trichy.  Post-education  After he got his law degree, his ambition of becoming a lawyer was fulfilled. He started his career as a junior advocate under T.S. Ramanatha Iyer ‚Äì a straightforward, upright person with Gandhian principles who was called ‚ÄòTiger of the bar‚Äô in Tenkasi. By sheer hard work and perseverance, he had a roaring practice, soon he established an office for himself and expanded it with four colleagues and two juniors. He was selected for the post of Munsif for Pondicherry Sessions court, which he did not want to join. He was always ready to subordinate his personal advancement for the cause of the country and for the cause of depressed classes for whom he was the only hope.  Political career  Despite several acknowledged handicaps and limitations, Arunachalam rose from very humble beginnings entering politics at an early age and was quickly enticed to national politics at his young age. As a mere party volunteer, he was Youth Congress Secretary in Tirunelveli (District Congress Committee). In 1977 he first contested, won and became the Member of Parliament from Tenkasi (Reserved constituency). That was the period when The Janata Party formed its Government in the center for the first time. Since power did not matter to Arunachalam he was ready to be in the opposition. As a man of Gandhian Principles he did not hesitate to stand by the democratic values of his party. Throughout his long political career he was steadfast to his loyalty to the Congress and the Gandhian moral and political ideology and he never felt himself persuaded by the rationalist, atheistic, religious, iconoclastic, communal and secessionist ideologies of his time. Drawn by an irresistible inner spirit of nationalism he reached the possible highest rank in the country(Union Cabinet Minister), also achieved a high reputation for his record of performance as a competent and efficient Member of Parliament during his six consecutive terms of his office to the Lok Sabha making up two decades and an outstanding national leader. He provided an unprecedented kind of leadership with simple, astute and pragmatic principles. He had attained popularity, which was unique. There were other leaders who were respected, looked up to and loved but the adoration which M.Arunachalam had, could hardly be rivaled by many others. The impact of M.Arunachalam in the socio-political life of Tamil Nadu is so unassailable that even his better political adversaries had to invoke the political traditions of M.Arunachalam for their political survivals. During his long and busy life, he came in close and active contact with a number of state and national leaders and his relations with them, how he reacted to them and their social and political activities, and how he, in his turn influenced them is a matter of particular interest to one and all. His position in the country's affairs brought him close to a number of prominent personalities and often he was called upon to intervene and settle disputes in the organization, which he did successfully for the most part, on the basis of his knowledge of men and matters and using his innate talent for effecting a consensus in complex political situations.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on November 5, 2009. In the episode, the library department tries to take control of a vacant lot where Leslie plans to build a park. Ron's ex-wife, one of Leslie's directors, sexually manipulates Ron to get what she wants. The episode was written by Mike Scully and directed by Troy Miller. \\"Ron and Tammy\\" featured Megan Mullally, the real-life wife of Parks actor Nick Offerman, in a special guest appearance as Ron's ex-wife, Tammy, who appears in several other episodes in the following seasons. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was seen by 4.93 million household viewers; its rating of 2.2 was the season's highest to that point. \\"Ron and Tammy\\" received highly positive reviews and is widely considered one of the best Parks and Recreation episodes, with many commentators praising Offerman's performance. Tammy later returned for the third season sequel episode, \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two\\" and several subsequent episodes. Plot Andy (Chris Pratt) takes over as the shoeshiner at the Pawnee town hall, replacing \\"Old Gus\\" (Jack Carter), who insults everybody during a farewell party. Later, Mark (Paul Schneider) breaks the bad news to Leslie (Amy Poehler) that the Pawnee library has placed a planning claim for Lot 48, which Leslie has been working to turn into a park. Leslie and the rest of the parks department express hatred for the library, which Leslie declares a \\"diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats\\", much to the confusion of Ann (Rashida Jones). Ron (Nick Offerman) is particularly angry to learn his ex-wife Tammy (Megan Mullally), who he insists is evil incarnate, is the new library director. Leslie decides to confront Tammy directly, only to find Tammy seems to be a friendly woman who instantly agrees to let Leslie have Lot 48 as a \\"professional courtesy\\". Impressed, Leslie brings Tammy to the parks department so she can talk to Ron and work out their differences. Tammy and an agitated Ron go off to have coffee, and Donna (Retta) insists to Leslie that the arrangement is a mistake because the two act crazy when they are together. At a local diner, Ron and Tammy immediately start a very loud argument in front of the other patrons. Moments later, however, the two are publicly making out on the table in front of everyone. The two rush off to a motel, where they frantically remove their clothing before even entering the building. Ann and her boyfriend Mark run into Andy, Ann's ex-boyfriend. Andy flirts with Ann in front of Mark, and openly admits he plans to win her back from him. Mark asks advice from Tom (Aziz Ansari), who suggests Mark should take the high road (although Tom tells the documentary crew that he never takes the high road, but tells everyone else to do so, so there is more room for him on \\"the low road\\"). Mark tries to have a gentlemanly discussion with Andy, who continues to insist he loves Ann, pointing to the many photos he has of her around his shoeshine station. Finally, Ann confronts Andy and tells him to stop discussing her with Mark, as well as to remove her photos from the wall. A cheery and singing Ron (who is wearing his \\"Tiger Woods\\" outfit, which is an outfit he wears after having sex) openly discusses the details his sexual exploits with Tammy to an uncomfortable Leslie. Although she is initially pleased with the results of her meddling, Leslie soon realizes Tammy is using sex to manipulate Ron to give her control of Lot 48. Leslie confronts Tammy, who admits to the plot and brags that this is how the library operates. Leslie tries to get Ron to break up with Tammy, but he insists he cannot confront her without Leslie's help. The two go to the library, where Ron starts to cave in when Tammy flirts with him. Leslie tells Ron to do whatever will make him happy, even if it means giving up the lot. Ron, impressed that anyone would put his own needs before their own, decides instead to break up with Tammy and give the lot back to Leslie. After breaking the news to Tammy off-camera, he leaves the library with a push-pin stuck in his forehead, and part of his mustache missing, and he and Leslie flee the library. The two share a drink, where Leslie encourages Ron to insult Tammy. Production \\"Ron and Tammy\\" was written by Mike Scully and directed by Troy Miller. The episode featured comedian and actress Megan Mullally in a guest appearance as Ron's ex-wife, Tammy. Mullally is the real- life wife of Nick Offerman, who plays Ron. Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur conceived the idea for the story, and asked Offerman whether he and Mullally would be opposed to her playing such a terrible character. Offerman was extremely responsive to the idea. Mullally said she enjoyed the script, particularly the dialogue of Ron describing Tammy, more than Tammy's part herself. Offerman and Mullally improvised many of their on-screen fights, as well as the varied methods of unusual kissing between the two characters. During the diner scene, in which Ron and Tammy switch between violent fighting and passionate kissing, Offerman accidentally pulled a diner table out of the wall after placing Mullally on top of it and kissing her. The scene was used in the final episode. Offerman said of filming the diner scenes, \\"At the end of doing that for a few hours, we said, you know that feels like it was five weeks worth of really good therapy.\\" During a scene with Ron and Tammy start stripping while running into a motel room, Mullally removed her top and appeared topless during filming. Mullally improvised the move and did not tell the crew she planned to do it. She said of filming the scene, \\"I didn't care, it was six in the morning, who cares, I didn't know anybody.\\" Offerman said his favorite scene in the episode was the one in which Leslie tried to break up with Tammy for him. He particularly enjoyed the rapport between Poehler and Mullally, and said he \\"just wanted to pinch himself\\" to prevent from laughing. Ron talks about the stock photo on his wall of a brunette woman holding a plate of breakfast and how it symbolizes his favourite things, and how \\"today he got the real thing\\" after a naked Tammy made him breakfast. In the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation, a photo of retired basketball coach Bobby Knight is on the wall. When it had to be removed for legal reasons, Parks and Recreation Schur searched an image library for \\"things we thought Ron would like\\" and found the breakfast photo. Schur said he thought it was perfect for the character, and it inspired the dialogue in the episode. The character Tammy later returned for the third season sequel episode, \\"Ron & Tammy: Part Two\\". Within a week of the episode's original broadcast, two deleted scenes from \\"Ron and Tammy\\" were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the first two-minute-long clip, Ron describes Tammy to Leslie in increasingly horrible ways, and Leslie talks to Tammy about previous problems the two had had, including an instance in which Tammy seduces Ron's father. In the second 90-second clip, Tom directs customers to Andy's shoeshine in exchange for a 40 percent commission, while Mark tries to get Ann to abandon her nursing patients to spend more time with him. Lawrence, a neighbor with a long-standing feud with Andy, mocks him by giving him dozens of soiled shoes to clean. Cultural references The day after having sex with Tammy, Ron comes to work wearing a red shirt and black pants, which prompts Tom to observe that Ron always dresses like golf pro Tiger Woods after having sex. This joke was written before the story of Woods' extramarital affairs scandal broke in the news in November 2009. Andy is said to have auditioned for the reality television show Survivor and the television game show Deal or No Deal. During an audition tape, he is shown gutting a fish to prove he could perform on Deal or No Deal, even though the action is far more appropriate for Survivor. During one scene, to Leslie's shock and confusion, Tammy said she would rather be Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, than Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady and wife of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Reception Ratings In its original American broadcast on November 5, 2009, \\"Ron and Tammy\\" was seen by 4.93 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. Among viewers aged between 18 and 49, the episode drew a 2.2 rating/6 share; a share represents the percentage of households using a television at the time the program is airing. It was the highest rating to that point for the season, and a 10 percent jump from the previous episode, \\"Greg Pikitis\\". Reviews \\"Ron and Tammy\\" received critical acclaim and is widely considered one of the best episodes of Parks and Recreation. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said \\"Ron and Tammy\\" was the funniest episode of the season, particularly for the dead-pan performance of Nick Offerman. Sepinwall also praised the parks employees' hatred for the library, and the fact that minor characters Jerry and Donna are further developing. Matt Fowler of IGN called it a \\"particularly solid episode\\", and he enjoyed seeing Leslie serve as the voice of reason. Fowler said the Andy subplot was less funny than the main plot, but it advanced Andy's character. Steve Heisler from The A.V. Club praised the episode and the performance of Offerman, who he said showed a deeper comedic range than in previous episodes. Heisler also praised Pratt and Poehler, who he said shined in showing a more sensible side. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis called the episode \\"damn near perfect\\" and said it made her \\"fall truly, madly, deeply in love with Parks and Recreation.\\" Ross Luippold of The Huffington Post called \\"Ron and Tammy\\" one of the highlights of the season. Steve Kandell of New York magazine called \\"Ron and Tammy\\" one of the moments when Parks and Recreation \\"found its voice and its footing\\". Dose writer Kat Angus said \\"Ron and Tammy\\" solidified Parks and Recreation as \\"the funniest show on TV this season\\". Angus praised Offerman's performance and his pairing with Mullally. TV Guide writer Matt Roush, who had previously been very critical of Parks and Recreation, called \\"Ron and Tammy\\" \\"unquestionably the show‚Äôs best episode to date\\". Roush particularly praised the comedic chemistry between Offerman and Mullally, who he said \\"make beautiful comic music together\\". Time magazine reviewer James Poniewozik called it an \\"excellent episode\\", and said it balanced well the show's formula of comedy focused on people and small-town government. H.T. \\"Hercules\\" Strong, a regular columnist with Ain't it Cool News, praised Poehler and Mullally, and said the editing, particularly during the diner scene with Ron and Tammy, was worthy of an Emmy Award nomination. CNN associated producer Henry Hanks praised the \\"uproarious performances\\" of both Offerman and Mullally, while another CNN review of called Mullally's guest performance \\"Emmy-worthy\\", and praised the performances of Offerman, Poehler and Pratt. It also said, \\"Poehler‚Äôs development of her character this season has been great to watch\\". DVD release \\"Ron and Tammy\\", along with the other 23 second season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a four-disc DVD set in the United States on November 30, 2010. The DVD included deleted scenes for each episode. It also included a commentary track for \\"Ron and Tammy\\" featuring Nick Offerman, Megan Mullally, and series co-creators Michael Schur and Greg Daniels.

Due to the high cost of electricity in Puerto Rico versus Arkansas, USA, Vassallo saw a savings the company between 10 and 13 cents per kilowatt in energy bills. As a result, ultimately the company moved all of its production facilities to the United States, and by 2011 its manufacturing facilities in Coto Laurel, Ponce, were being rented out to a college named Caribbean University.

Examples  Since the release of the Wii console, people have been exploring different new ways in which to use the Wii Remote. Many third-party applications are currently in development through Wii homebrew.Jamin Brophy- Warren, Magic Wand: How Hackers Make Use Of Their Wii-motes, Wall Street Journal, April 28, 2007 One popular Windows program called GlovePIE allows the Wii Remote to be used on a personal computer to emulate a keyboard, mouse or joystick. Connecting the Wii Remote to a personal computer is done via a Bluetooth connection. The Bluetooth program BlueSoleil has been proven to successfully connect a Wii Remote to a PC. Still another program (like GlovePIE) is needed to utilize the Wii Remote's protocol and to use the data it offers. The Wii Remote Bluetooth protocol can be implemented on other devices including cell phones, which often have poor usability with games. Two students have demonstrated this concept by creating a driver software that has the capability to connect the Wii Remote to a Symbian OS smartphone. The idea behind this driver is that a mobile phone with a TV-out port can replace the game console. Programmer Johnny Lee has posted video demos and sample code at his website related to the use of the Wii Remote for finger tracking, low-cost multipoint interactive whiteboards, and head tracking for desktop VR displays. This was the subject for his presentation at the prestigious TED conference, where he demonstrated several such applications. The WiimoteProject forum has become the discussion, support and sharing site for Lee's Wii Remote projects and other newer developments. The Wii Remote is also used in fields outside of standard computing. The United States government has experimented with using it to control Packbot, a bomb disposal robot. Studies have also been conducted to use the Wii Remote as a practice method to fine-tune surgeons' hand motions. Utilizing DarwiinRemote, researchers at the University of Memphis have adapted the Wii Remote for data collection in cognitive psychology experiments.Nintendo Wii With A New Mission: Wiimote As An Interface Bridging Mind And Body Autodesk have released a plugin that allows the Wii Remote to control orientation of 3D models in Autodesk Design Review.  Controller alternatives  It was not until a few years after the Wii was released that third party companies such as Nyko and Mad Catz began making cheaper alternatives to the Wii Remote, sometimes in a variety of colors. Nyko's Wand controller is one such controller, with another version, Wand+, announced to include built-in MotionPlus functionality without the need for changing attachments.Nyko's Wand+ Has Wii Motion Plus Built Right In There have also been several third party Nunchuk controllers, some of which have wireless functionality.  Glove kits and grips  Nunchuk with the Grip-It accessory attached Although Nintendo has released its own free Wii Remote Jacket that is shipped by request to existing Wii Remote owners, third-party glove kits to provide a better grip and cushioning (when compared to an un-jacketed remote) have been available for the controller since its launch. These have been produced in several colors, some of which glow in the dark or change hue depending on the heat of the player's hand. There are various themes as well, including The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess and Pok√©mon Battle Revolution. The Grip-It is a rubber overlay for the analog sticks of the Nunchuk and Classic Controller. These items increase the overall thumb grip on the analog sticks and give them added cushioning.Grip-It  Steering wheels  Prior to Nintendo's own Wii Wheel, several third-party steering wheel accessories had been introduced for the Wii Remote. One released by Ubisoft, the Wii Steering Wheel, was developed by Thrustmaster. It is bundled with certain games, such as Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT Pro Series. The accessory, which is only for aesthetic/ergonomic enhancement, is meant for driving-style gameplay in which the Wii Remote would be held lengthwise in a two-handed gamepad orientation, steering the subject by tilting the controller. The Wii Steering Wheel is also sold separately. Since the Wii Steering Wheel was revealed, other similarly designed steering wheel accessories have been produced, including the Wii Racing Wheel by Intec.Gamestop.com - Buy Wii Racing Wheel - Wii  Sword and shield attachments  Sword and shield attachment sets have been released by various manufacturers, including ASiD Tech and Camy International. The accessories are simply shells, and do not provide any other functional purpose. The ASiD kit comes with a sword, a shield, and knife with a design resembling a scimitar, all molded from monotone plastic (white or black). The Hero Pack by Camy International consists of a sword and a shield, with colored designs very similar to the Master Sword and Hylian Shield from The Legend of Zelda series. The blade of the Hero Pack sword is made of soft foam for safety.Camy Hero Pack With both sets, the Wii Remote is cradled in the handle of the sword or knife so that the face buttons are accessible, with clearings for the B button and pointer lens. The Nunchuk is clipped into the handle of the shield. The configurations correspond to the sword and shield controls for The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. Only three Wii games use Wii Remote and Nunchuk gestures to implement sword-and-shield combat, which are Twilight Princess, The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest and The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. In addition to fantasy-based sword attachments, there are also sci-fi laser sword attachments for the Wii Remote, which would befit Star Wars video games released for the Wii (such as Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed and Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Lightsaber Duels) that implement lightsaber combat with the Wii Remote. GameStop sells the Wii Dual Glow Sabers made by dreamGEAR.Wii Dual Glow Sabers Thrustmaster, Intec, CTA Digital have also manufactured similar laser sword attachments that are widely available for purchase.  Sports packages  The Wii Sports pack was released by GameStop in the United States and Logic3 in Europe. It includes a baseball bat, a golf club, and a tennis racket. It is very similar to the sword accessory and attaches to the Wii Remote to allow a more realistic experience with Wii Sports. Soon after GameStop released their pack, PDP (formally Pelican Accessories) released a Wii Nerf Sports Pack. It is identical to GameStop's pack however all the attachments are made out of Nerf foam material. The boxing gloves are a separate accessory to the Wii Sports pack. With those, the player can put the Wii Remote and Nunchuk inside each glove underneath where one slips in hands. The Nunchuk is assigned to the left glove while the Wii Remote is right. In this way one can punch like an actual boxer instead of jabbing the controllers away from oneself. The Wii Cue is a snooker cue extension for the Wii Remote. It is bundled with the game WSC REAL 08: World Snooker Championship. The Wii Cue is in effect a large stick that comes out in front of the Wii Remote. The player holds the remote in one hand and rests the cue between the thumb and forefinger to simulate a cue for snooker or pool. The Wii Rod is a fishing rod attachment for the Wii Remote. The remote slips into a plastic jacket that has a rod on the end. It also features a reel that the Nunchuk fits into, allowing the player to reel in the fish with the Nunchuk. The Wii Rod will be bundled with the game Rapala's Fishing Frenzy with Rod.Wii Rod  Chargers  Nyko Charging Station (a.k.a. Nyko Charging Cradle) While Nintendo does not offer any rechargeable options for the Wii Remote, recharging systems have been developed by various third- party peripheral companies. Nintendo has not released a rechargeable battery kit in regions outside Japan, but the Wii Remote and WaveBird controllers both use special battery contacts that are compatible with previously-released Game Boy Advance accessories (AGB-003 and AGB-004, battery and charger respectively). Several manufacturers offer direct-charging systems, many of which involve an integrated battery pack/compartment cover with electrical contacts that connect to a charging cradle. Other available features include silicone-covered battery packs for added grip, nunchuk cradles, and compatibility with WaveBird and Game Boy Advance. After Nintendo introduced the protective Wii Remote Jacket as standard-issue for Wii Remotes, peripheral companies later released contactless direct-charging systems which utilize inductive charging, allowing a Wii Remote to be charged with a Wii Remote Jacket on. On August 25, 2008, Sanyo released its first Contactless Charger Set for Wii Remote in Japan, which features Sanyo's \\"eneloop\\" low self- discharge NiMH battery technology, and is marketed under the eneloop brand. The Contactless Charger Set for Wii Remote is made under official license from Nintendo. On May 11, 2009, Performance Designed Products released the Energizer Induction Charge System in the United States, which is compatible with the Wii MotionPlus. To better facilitate charging for both Wii Remotes and Wii Remotes with Wii MotionPlus, some newer inductive charging systems feature alternative designs which use magnets to align the controllers. Devices include the Energizer Flat Panel Induction Charger and the Nyko Charge Base IC, both released in late 2009. The Psyclone- and React-branded Wii 4-Dock Recharge Station was made the subject of a product recall in August 2009, due to fire risk. The Joytech \\"Wii Power Station\\" charging kit was made the subject of a product recall in March 2010, also due to fire risk. Mad Catz also released a Sonic the Hedgehog collectable Wiimote charger in late 2010.  Arcade joysticks  With the announcement of Neo Geo games being available on the Wii Virtual Console service, third-party game peripheral manufacturer Hori revealed the \\"Fighting Stick Wii\\" controller. An expansion of the Wii Remote, the Fighting Stick Wii is an arcade style controller with compatibility with the non-analog functionality of the Classic Controller (the L and R buttons have no analog functionality, and analog sticks are not included). In addition, the action buttons have turbo button functionality (approximately 20 presses per second). The controller was released in Japan on August 30, 2007, for JP¬•5,280. The Fighting Stick Wii was released on November 6, 2007 in the United States. SNK Playmore have also released a Wii-compatible version of the Neo Geo Stick 2, which resembles the first party controller of the Neo Geo console. Like the Hori Fighting Stick Wii, it has similar non- analog Classic Controller functionality. It was released in Japan on April 10, 2008. Overline Gaming has released an arcade joystick attachment, named The Shaft. In conjunction with the US Release of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars. Mad Catz released a joystick known as the Tatsunoko Vs. Capcom Arcade Fightstick, which not only works with Tatsunoko Vs. Capcom, but with most Virtual Console and Wii games which use the classic controllers (one exception though is Heavy Barrel on Data East Arcade Classics due to the use of the classic controller's right thumbstick for aiming purposes).  Gun peripherals  Despite an official Wii Zapper expansion released by Nintendo, some gun peripherals have been shown by third parties. The first of these appeared in early April, when video game retailer GameStop listed a \\"Wii Blaster\\" peripheral on its website, with a release date of May 1, 2007. Originally listed without a specified manufacturer, the Wii Blaster had been speculated to be the Zapper,Nintendojo ~ Nintendo News, Previews, Reviews, Analysis and Interaction but has since been indicated to be produced by third party accessories manufacturer Core Gamer. According to GameStop on May 5, 2007, the Wii Blaster release date was changed to June 26, 2007 and is available for purchase.Gamestop.com - Buy Wii Blaster - Wii  Musical instrument controllers  A Guitar Hero controller for the Wii The Wii version of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is bundled with a white Gibson Les Paul style guitar controller. It includes a slot for the Wii Remote to fit into, though the Wii Remote Jacket must be removed first, and utilizes the wireless capabilities, accelerometer, rumble feature and speaker of the Wii Remote. It also features an analog stick that can be used to navigate the Wii Menu. Like the PS3 and Xbox 360 guitar controllers, the Wii Les Paul can be customized with detachable faceplates. The Les Paul also comes with the special edition of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith which includes an Aerosmith faceplate. The Gibson Les Paul controller is also available for purchase separately from the game. At the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show, Nyko revealed a similar guitar controller for the Wii, a replica of a butterscotch blonde Fender Telecaster. This marks the first third-party guitar controller for the console. Other third-party guitar controllers have also since become available. In lieu of using guitar controllers, the Wii version of PopStar Guitar uses a Wii Remote controller shell called the AirG that allows players to play air guitar-style in conjunction with the Nunchuk.XS Games Reveals AirG Peripheral for PopStar Guitar In addition to a revised guitar controller, Guitar Hero World Tour, the sequel to Guitar Hero III features a wireless drum kit controller which also has a slot for the Wii Remote. The Wii version of Taiko no Tatsujin features its own drum controller called the TaTaCon (styled as a miniature taiko drum) that plugs into the Wii Remote.TGS 08: Taiko Drum Master Wii hands-on The Wii version of Samba de Amigo features additional maraca shaped attachments for the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. And in 2009, the DJ Turntable was released to accompany DJ Hero.  Wii jOG  jOG for the wii, or as it is more commonly known, Wii jOG is a device developed by New Concept Gaming for Nintendo's Wii console. It was released on October 31, 2008 in the United Kingdom and is based on a similar device made by the same company for the Sony's PlayStation 2 console. New Concept Gaming went into liquidation in 2010, and all official websites went offline. The device serves as a pedometer that attaches to the Nunchuk extension of the Wii Remote. The device detects body motion, and users can move characters on the screen by making steps or by jogging in place. The device is compatible with Wii games which use the nunchuck joystick, with some games being more compatible than others. Studies conducted by John Moores University have shown that the device makes users exercise, saying that users will take between 6,000 and 10,000 steps per hour of gameplay while using the device, burning approximately 225 kcal per hour. Users have also experienced a 40% higher heart rate using the Wii jOG than playing a video game while seated.

Representatives from the de facto Micheletti government and deposed President Manuel Zelaya reached the agreement after several weeks of diplomatic dialogue in late 2009.  Dialogue  The Guaymuras dialogue began after the failure of the San Jos√© accord to achieve a diplomatic solution to the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis. The dialogue involved representatives from both Roberto Michelleti and Manuel Zelaya, and was facilitated initially by Oscar Arias.  Agreement  On 30 October 2009, the Organization of American States announced that representatives from both Micheletti and Zelaya had reached an agreement that would place the decision to restore Zelaya to the presidency in the hands of the National Congress. The content and image of the signed accord was released to the public. Text of Agreement Preamble We,translation used is from this source checked to original Spanish Honduran citizens, men and women convinced of the necessity to strengthen the state of law, to aid our constitution and the laws of our Republic, deepen democracy and assure a climate of peace and tranquility for our people, have carried out a frank and intense process of political dialogue to seek a negotiated and peaceful exit to the crisis in which our country has been submerged in recent months. As fruit of this dialogue in which has predominated the wisdom, tolerance, and patriotic spirit of all the participants, we have drafted a political accord that will permit the reestablishment of civic harmony and assure a proper climate for democratic governability in our country. This accord, we are sure, will define the road to peace, reconciliation, and democracy, urgent demands of Honduran society. The agreement on this accord demonstrates yet again, that Honduran men and women are capable of successfully carrying out dialogue and thanks to that and by means of it, reach the high goals that society demands and the country requires. In virtue of the foregoing, we have agreed on the following accords: The Government of National Reconciliation and Unity To achieve reconciliation and strengthen democracy, we will form a Government of Unity and National Reconciliation made up of representatives of the various political parties and social organizations, recognized for their capabilities, honesty, aptness, and willingness to dialogue, who will occupy the distinct secretariates and subsecretariates, as well as other dependencies of State, in conformity with article 246 and following of the constitution of the Republic of Honduras. In light of the fact that before the 28 of June, the Executive Power had not submitted a General Budget of Income and Expenses for consideration to the National Congress, in conformity with that established in article 205, number 32 of the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras, this government of unity and national reconciliation will respect and function on the basis of the general budget, recently approved by the National Congress for fiscal year 2009. Renouncing the convocation of a National Constituent Assembly or reforming the unreformable articles of the Constitution. To achieve reconciliation and fortify democracy, we reiterate our respect for the Constitution and the laws of our country, abstaining from making calls for the convening of a National Constituent Assembly, in direct or indirect manner and renouncing also promoting or aiding any popular poll with the goal of reforming the Constitution in order to permit presidential re-election, modify the form of government or contravene any of the irreformable articles of our Magna Carta. In particular, we will not make public declarations nor exercise any type of influence inconsistent with articles 5; 373 and 373 [sic: 374?] of the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras, and we reject energetically every manifestation contrary to the spirit of said articles and of the special law that regulates the referendum and the plebiscite. The General Elections and the transfer of Government To achieve reconciliation and fortify democracy, we reiterate that, in conformity with the articles 44 and 51 of the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras, the vote is universal, obligatory, egalitarion, direct, free and secret, and it corresponds to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, with full autonomy and independence, to supervise and execute everything related to the electoral acts and processes. At the same time, we make a call to the Honduran people to peacefully participate in the next general elections and to avoid all kinds of demonstrations that would oppose the elections or their results, or promote insurrection, antijuridical conduct, civil disobedience or other acts that could produce violent confrontations or transgressions of the law. With the goal of demonstrating the transparency and legitimacy of the electoral process, we ask urgently that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal that it authorize and accredit the presence of international missions from now until the declaration of the results of the general elections, as well as the transfer of powers that will take place, in conformity with Article 237 of the Constitution of the Republic, the 27 of January 2010. The Armed Forces and National Police To reach reconciliation and fortify democracy, we affirm our will to comply in all its measures with article 272 of the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras, according to which the Armed Forces remain at the disposition of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal from one month before the general elections, for the purpose of guaranteeing the free exercise of suffrage, the custody, transparency, and guarding of the electoral materials and all the other aspects of security of the process. We reaffirm the professional, apolitical, obedient and non-deliberative character of the Honduran Armed Forces. In the same way, we agree that the national police should be strictly subject to that prescribed in its special legislation. Executive Power To achieve reconciliation and fortify democracy, in the spirit of the themes of the proposed San Jose Accord, both negotiating commissions have decided, respectfully, that the National Congress, as an institutional expression of popular sovereignty, in the use of its powers, in consultation with the points that the Supreme Court of Justice should consider pertinent and in conformity with the law, should resolve in that proceeding in respect to \\"return the incumbency of Executive Power to its state previous to the 28 of June until the conclusion of the present governmental period, the 27 of January of 2010\\". The decision that the National Congress adopts should lay the foundations to achieve social peace, political tranquility and governability that society demands and the country needs\\". The Verification Commission and the Truth Commission To achieve reconciliation and fortify democracy, we are disposed to the creation of a Commission of Verification of the promises assumed in this Accord, and of those that shall derive from it, coordinated by the Organization of American States (OAS). Said commission will be made up of two members of the international community and two members of the national community, these last will be sought one by each of the parties. The Verification Commission will be charged with giving witness of the strict completion of all of the points of this Accord, and will receive for this the full cooperation of Honduran public institutions. Incompletion of any of the commitments contained in this Accord, proven and declared by the Verification Commission, will produce the activation of measures that the Commission will establish against the transgressor or transgressors. With the goal of clarifying the deeds that occurred before and after the 28 of June 2009, there will also be created a Truth Commission that will identify the acts that led to the present situation, and provide to the Honduran people elements to avoid that those deeds will be repeated in the future. This Commission of Dialogue recommends that the next Government, in the framework of a national consensus, constitutes the said Truth Commission in the first half of the year 2010. The normalisation of relations of the Republic of Honduras with the International Community On committing ourselves to faithfully comply with the promises assumed in the present Accord, we respectfully ask the immediate revocation of those measures and sanctions adopted at a bilateral or multilateral level, that in any manner would affect the reinsertion and full participation of the Republic of Honduras in the international community and its access to all forms of cooperation. We make a call to the international community that it should reactivate as soon as possible the projects of cooperation in effect with the Republic of Honduras and continue with the negotiation of future ones. In particular, we ask urgently that, on the request of competent authorities the international cooperation be made effective that might be necessary and opportune for the Verification Commission and the future Truth Commission to assure the faithful completion and follow-through of the commitments acquired in this Accord. Final Dispositions Any difference in interpretation or application of the present Accord will be submitted to the Verification Commission, which will determine, in keeping with that disposed in the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras and in the legislation in effect and through an authentic interpretation of the present Accord, the solution that corresponds. Taking into account that the present Accord is a product of the understanding and fraternity among Honduran men and women, we ask vehemently that the international community respect the sovereignty of the Republic of Honduras, and fully observe the time-honored principle in the Charter of the United Nations of non- interference in the internal affairs of other States. Calendar of completion of the Accords Given the immediate entrance into effect of this accord from the date of its signing, and with the goal of clarifying the timetable for completion and follow-through of the commitments acquired to reach national reconciliation, we agree on the following calendar of completion: *30 of October 2009 1\\\\. Signing and entry into effect of the accord. 2\\\\. Formal delivery of the accords to Congress for the effects of point 5, of \\"Executive Power\\". *2 of November 2009 1\\\\. Appointment of the Verification Commission *Beginning with the signing of the present Accord and no later than the 5 of November 1\\\\. Appointment and installation of the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation *27 of January 2010 1\\\\. Celebrate the transfer of government *First half of 2010 1\\\\. Formation of the Truth Commission Final Declaration In the name of reconciliation and the patriotic spirit that has convened us at the table of dialogue, we commit to complete in good faith the present Accord and that which derives from it. The world is witness to that demonstration of unity and peace, to which we commit our civic conscience, and patriotic devotation. Together, we shall know to demonstrate our valor and determination to fortify the State of Law and construct a tolerant, pluralistic, and democratic society. We sign the present Accord in the city of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, the 30th of October 2009. Acknowledgement We take advantage of the occasion to thank the accompaniment of the good offices of the international community, in particular the OAS, and its Secretary General, Jose Miguel Insulza, the Missions of Chancellors of the Hemisphere; the President of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias Sanchez; the ultimate government of the United States, its president Barack Obama; and its Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. The entry into effectiveness of the Tegucigalpa/San Jose Accord For internal effects, the Accord has full effectiveness from its signing. For effects of protocol and ceremony, there will be carried out a public act of signing on the 2nd of November 2009.  Failure of the accord  Micheletti asked Zelaya to provide him with a list of candidates that Micheletti could select from and include in a unity government. Zelaya chose not to give a list of candidates to Micheletti‚Äîarguing that he should be at the head of any unity government‚Äîwhile several of the other parties did submit names for consideration. Zelaya also stated that the Congress was unacceptably delaying the agreed-upon vote on his restoration. Zelaya had hoped to be back in office by November 5, the deadline for the two sides to establish a power-sharing government. \\"By Thursday, the government of national unity should be installed,\\" he said in a meeting broadcast by Radio Globo. \\"By that day, point No. 5 has to be resolved,\\" he added, referring to the clause of the agreement that covers his return to office. In fact, the accord did not establish a firm deadline by which Congress has to make a final decision on Zelaya's reinstatement, Organization of American States Political Affairs Secretary Victor Rico noted following Zelaya's comments. \\"There is no timeframe for Zelaya to return to office,\\" he said. \\"Only Congress can make that determination.\\" When Micheletti announced he had formed what he called the unity government without input from Zelaya, Zelaya declared the agreement \\"dead\\" early on November 6. Diplomats from the United States have attempted to revive the pact since then through public statements and private meetings with the two parties.

During the Napoleonic Wars she served with some success in the Baltic and the Caribbean. Belette was lost in the Kattegat in 1812 when she hit a rock off L√¶s√∏. Baltic Belette was commissioned in April 1806 under Commander Richard Piercy for the North Sea. Commander John Phillimore took command in September and sailed Belette in the English Channel and the Downs, taking part in Commodore Edward Owen's attack on Boulogne. Belette was occupied in early 1807 with conveying supplies to the besieged town of Kolberg. In June 1807 Belette was off Suffolk when she tried to land a M. Bedezee, a Prussian envoy carrying some important despatches. The boat overturned a few hundred meters off shore and Bedezee drowned, as did a midshipman and three crewmen. A master's mate and a crewman were saved, but the despatches were lost.Burke, Edmund (1807) The Annual register of world events: a review of the year. (London: Longmans), Volume 49, p.447. Next, she was attached to Admiral James Gambier's fleet which returned to the Baltic to attack Copenhagen again in 1807. Phillimore distinguished himself during the battle, particularly in an engagement at the end of August, when Belette became becalmed off the Danish coast. Sixteen Danish gunboats attacked Belette, which sank three of them before boats from other British ships arrived and towed her clear. Gambier rewarded Phillimore for his courage by giving him the honour of carrying Gambier's despatches to the Admiralty. As a result, Phillimore received a promotion to post-captain on 13 October; however he remained with Belette. The expedition to Copenhagen resulted in prize money for Bellette both for warships and merchant vessels. Belette was one of seven British warships sharing in the proceeds of the capture on 28 August of the Danish merchant vessel Sally. Then Belette is listed among the vessels sharing in the prize money for the ships and provisions that the British captured at Copenhagen. Bellette also shared with and a number of other warships in the captures of several merchant vessels: the Aurora (30 August), Paulina (30 August), Ceres (31 August), Odiford (4 September), and Benedicta (12 September). On 19 November Belette, with the gun-vessels Tigress and Safeguard in company, recaptured the ship Lively. Belette brought the British ambassador, Lord Hutchinson back to Britain in February 1808. While sailing to Gothenburg he encountered a Danish Navy two-decker, but was able to escape by sailing into shallower waters. Caribbean In February 1808 command passed to George Sanders who sailed her on the North Sea station.Sanders had commanded in the Baltic the previous year He then took her to the Leeward Islands, sailing on 3 May 1808. Belette captured a privateer on 2 July after a pursuit of 12 hours that ended some 70 miles SE of Barbados. The privateer was the Jalouse, which was armed with four 12-pounder guns and had a crew of 75 men. Sanders described her as sailing remarkably fast and as having done \\"much Mischief to the Trade.\\" Before running afoul of Belette, Jalouse had captured the Mary and the Lark, both of Halifax, and the General Green, of Surinam, which last some other British warship had since recaptured. Around this time Belette captured the privateer Franchise, of nine guns and 70 men. Belette captured Franchise windward of Barbados and carried her into Barbados.Lloyd's List, no. 4278, - accessed 10 February 2015. In August Belette captured the French privateer Jos√©phine, which the Royal Navy took into service as Morne Fortunee. In British service she was armed with eight 18-pounder carronades and two 6-pounder guns, and had a crew of 55 men.{{refnSome accounts give the privateer's name as Morne Fortunee, and report that she originally carried 14 guns. Admiral Lord Collingwood received intelligence that the French corvette Rapide was on her way from Bayonne with dispatches and he asked Admiral Lord Alexander Cochrane to attempt to intercept her. On 8 August Belette captured Rapide, of one gun and 22 men, and took her into Barbados. However, Rapides captain had managed to throw the dispatches overboard before Belette captured her. On 23 July duplicates of the dispatches and much besides were found concealed aboard the cartel Phoenix, which had sailed from Cayenne and had stopped in Barbados. She had aroused suspicion, leading Cochrane to having her searched. Because carrying these documents was a violation of the cartel (truce) flag, the British seized Phoenix and sent the seized documents in .National Register, (11 September 1808), p.584. On 23 August Belette captured the French privateer schooner Confiance, of seven guns (though pierced for 16) and 70 men. She was three days out from Cayenne. The Royal Navy took Confiance into service as . On 5 December 1808 Belette captured the French letter of marque brig Revanche, of six 12-pounder guns and 44 men. Revanche was taking provisions from Bordeaux to Guadeloupe when she encountered Belette. Sanders described her as having been \\"a very successful Privateer all this War, and was intended for a Cruizer in those Seas.\\" Belette sent Revanche into Antigua.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4325. In February 1809, Belette participated in the combined naval and military assault and capture of the French-held island of Martinique. This qualified those of her crew still alive in 1847 for the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM) with clasp \\"Martinique\\". Belette was among the 42 warships that shared in the proceeds for the capture of Martinique. She then participated in the capture of Guadeloupe (January ‚Äì February 1810), which earned for her crew the clasp \\"Guadaloupe\\" to the NGSM, as well as further prize money, which she shared with 49 other vessels. The medal data indicates that David Sloane took command after Martinique and before Guadeloupe. He may, in fact, have sailed her back to the Leeward Islands from Britain. North Sea & Baltic In 1811 Sloane took Belette back to home waters. Danish records suggest that in the summer of 1811 she was in the North Sea. Unknown to the British, Danish Captain Hans Peter Holm had returned to Egersund (SW Norway) with Lolland and four other brigs.Tops√∏e-Jensen, Vol 1, p.599.Wandell (1915), p.368. On 1 May 1811,O'Bryne (1849), p.274. the British sent four boats from Belette, and ,Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, p.14. into the western end of the sound, expecting to capture some shipping or do other mischief. The circumstances of locality and wind did not permit the Danish brigs to enter the sound from the further end, but Holm sent the Danish ships' boats under Lieutenant Niels Gerhardt Langemach Tops√∏e-Jensen, Vol 2, p.68. up the sound to oppose the British. Some of the Danes landed to set an ambush from the cliff tops, whilst the armed boats were hidden behind a skerry. As the British rowed boldly in, they met unexpected fire from howitzers and muskets; they immediately withdrew, with the Danish boats in pursuit. The Danes captured one of the British boats and her crew of an officer and 17 men, who had come from Belette. The Danes would have captured more but for the confusion that an explosion of a powder keg on one of the Danish boats caused. The confusion enabled the remaining British boats to reach the protection of their squadron. By 1812 Belette was in the Baltic. On 24 May, Belette and captured the Danish sloop St. Jorgen. After the outbreak of the War of 1812, the British navy seized a number of American ships in British ports or that had otherwise not received the news. Belette was among the vessels sharing in the capture, on 12 August, of the Cuba, Caliban, Edward, Galen, Halcyon, and Cygnet. On 30 October, Belette was protecting the rear of a convoy when her acting master, Mr. James Turnbull, took her yawl and off Roms√∏ captured a Danish rowboat armed with two 2-pounder guns and small arms. The Danes put up a short but spirited resistance before surrendering. Five men of the Danish crew of a lieutenant and 15 men were severely wounded.The letter in the London Gazette gives the name of Belettes captain as Swan. This is probably a mistake, or Swan was temporary. Loss On 24 November 1812 Belette, under Sloane, was in the Kattegat leading Russian ships through the south-west passage of Anholt towards Gothenburg when she went aground on a sunken rock called \\"John\\" (or \\"Fannot\\") off L√¶s√∏. She filled with water and broke in two. The shoals were shallow enough that her rigging remained above water. Her crew took to the rigging but during the night many died of exposure or fell into the sea when they lost their grip. Only six of her entire crew of 120 or so men and boys escaped death from exposure or drowning.

They returned to Recife in 1987 to perform in the city's nightclubs and play with various local musicians. In 1992, Bicudo joined the group. The trio's first name was Palladium. Later, the trio was renamed Tusch. The band was founded as Mallavoodoo in 1996 in Recife, Pernambuco, when Perrelli joined the trio. The band's influences included rock and roll, progressive rock, jazz and blues, and its songs combined classical and electric instruments. Initially, Jo√£o Maur√≠cio served as vocalist. However, he left the group after a short time. Mallavoodoo, now a quintet, began playing at a Recife nightclub, Sant√≥rio Geral. However, the group preferred playing instrumental music and gradually included their own songs in their repertoire. Mallavoodoo's four instrumentalists (Silveira, Bicudo, Lobo and Perrelli) stayed together for ten years, and recorded the band's first album, O inverno e a gar√ßa, which was released in 2001. The production of this album, which cost 28,000 reais, was financed by Jayme da Fonte Hospital and Recife City Hall. A show was held to celebrate the release in Shopping S√≠tio da Trindade, Recife, in 2001. In 2006, Perrelli was replaced by Barros, another very experienced musician. The group's new lineup recorded its second album in the same year, Soma. Both albums were produced by Thales Silveira and financed by Recife City Hall. Since its inception, the band has played in many festivals around Brazil and especially Pernambuco. Among all the events which the group performed in, the most traditional were: Recife Jazz Festival and Festival de Inverno de Garanhuns. In both albums, Mallavoodoo sought new directions for contemporary instrumental music. Their members usually play instrumental covers of the songs of bands such as the Beatles and Deep Purple, with no vocals. Mallavoodoo is considered one of the main instrumental music groups in Brazil's Pernambuco state.

Between 3,000 and 5,000 people visit the market every Saturday.  History  The Eugene Saturday Market first opened on May 9, 1970 with 29 vendors. It was located on city property adjacent to a city-owned parking structure in downtown Eugene. Each vendor paid $1 to participate. On the opening Saturday, it rained all day. Nevertheless, the market was successful enough that the Eugene City Council agreed to allow the hippies to continue using the site.\\"Downtown market trial OK‚Äôd\\", The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 28 April 1970, p. 9B.Bryerton, Gene, \\"New outdoor mart has damp opening\\", The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 10 May 1970.\\"Saturday market to begin\\", The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 5 June 1970.Bryerton, Gene, \\"Saturday Market in Overpark area establishes some rules\\", The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 20 September 1970.

As a result, the Eugene Saturday Market was officially established. This arrangement with Lane County allowed the use of the Park Blocks only during the summer months. In the fall, the vendors were required to move to the upper level of a county-owned parking structure,Paseman, Llyod, \\"Saturday Market decides to move\\", The Register- Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 26 August 1971. known as the \\"butterfly lot\\", across the street from the Park Blocks. The Eugene Saturday Market continued to operate in those two locations until the end of the 1982 season.\\"Market move a good one\\", The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 2 December 1982. Over time, the Saturday markets held in the parking structure lost their customer base. As the number of vendors dwindled, the Saturday Market board of directors began working with the City of Eugene and Lane County officials to find a new venue. In April 1983, the Eugene Saturday Market was relocated to a two-block park area at the intersection of Oak Street and 8th Avenue. This new venue was an attractive setting, with a central fountain and had enough space for 100 to 125 vendors. It was also centrally located in the downtown areas. Over the years, this has helped attract people to the market. In 2006, the City of Eugene prepared a master plan for the Park Block area. The plan included the Saturday Market as an important element in the area's long-term development.‚ÄúExecutive Summary‚Äù , Eugene Park Block Master Plan, City of Eugene, Eugene, Oregon, October 2006.

It inspired the creation of a similar market in Portland, which took the same name, the Portland Saturday Market, and has been in operation since 1974.  Farmers market  In 1978, a county task force was created to determine if a farmers market could be successful if it were located adjacent to the Eugene Saturday Market. The concept was to offer an open-air venue for local growers to market their produce directly to the public. The Eugene Saturday Market organization would oversee the new farmers market. Based on the task force's recommendation, the county approved the first farmers market in August 1979. It was held on Saturday in a parking lot adjacent to the Saturday Market. The Lane County Farmers Market became an independent organization in 1989.

In the episode, stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb and their friends host a circus in their backyard, attracting much attention from the neighborhood. The boys' sister, Candace, tries to expose the cirque to her mother while experiencing an allergic reaction to wild parsnips. \\"Jerk De Soleil\\" was written by Bobby Gaylor and Martin Olson, and directed by series co-founder Dan Povenmire. Povenmire additionally provided the voice for Candace on scenes where the character was experiencing an allergic reaction, as the crew was unable to lower the voice of her regular actress, Ashley Tisdale, to the necessary degree. The episode was originally broadcast on February 10, 2008, as part of the special marathon event \\"Phineas and Ferb-urary.\\" It received generally positive reviews. Plot Plans for Phineas, his stepbrother Ferb, and their friends Isabella, Baljeet, Buford, and Django to go to the local circus, \\"Cirque de lune\\" are ruined after the performance is canceled due to the ringleader having an allergy after Baljeet comes from his mom's car at the start of the episode. Undeterred, the boys and their friends decide to build their own circus in their backyard and have themselves and their other friends act as performers. The cirque tent is speedily put up and the group prepare their costumes. Candace discovers the boy's circus and has set out to tell their mother, Linda, when Jeremy, a boy who has romantic feelings for her, stops by to give her a basket of plants. Unfortunately they include some wild parsnips, which give Candace an allergic reaction: to hide her hives and deep, scratchy voice she dons a sweatsuit and a paper bag before going to the mall to tell Linda about the boys' plans, and then sings E.V.I.L. B.O.Y.S. where Linda, Vivian Garcia-Shapiro, and Jeremy's mom are. Exasperated, Candace returns to the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through the roof of the tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving everyone in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.

It features a debate between prominent antitheist Christopher Hitchens and Douglas Wilson, a Presbyterian pastor of Christ Church, a Calvinist Christian church located in Moscow, Idaho. Described by Hitchens as a \\"buddy-and-road\\" movie, it provides an overview of several days' worth of debates following the release of their book Is Christianity Good for the World? The book was generated by correspondence published in the magazine Christianity Today. Production The partnership between Hitchens and Wilson began in 2007, when Hitchens invited anyone to debate his viewpoints, following the release of his book God is not Great. Wilson's agent heard the offer and put him in touch with Hitchens, leading to a series of written debates published in Christianity Today, which eventually were compiled into the book Is Christianity Good for the World?. Filmmaker Darren Doane heard about the exchanges between the two and sought them out to make a film. The film was featured on CNN, Fox News; NPR; The Laura Ingraham Show and others. After the men finally met in person while shooting the film, both got along well, despite their heated exchanges, in part because of a shared appreciation for P. G. Wodehouse. Reception Hitchens said in Slate magazine, \\"I haven't yet run into an argument that has made me want to change my mind... However, I have discovered that the so-called Christian right is much less monolithic, and very much more polite and hospitable, than I would once have thought, or than most liberals believe.\\"http://www.slate.com/id/2233586/ Wilson argued that atheists could be good people, could share Christian values and Christians could repudiate many things atheists also repudiated. He also argued that atheists could not argue for an objective moral standard but could affirm a standard, if it happened to exist, that of \\"eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow maybe we die\\", but no other.

The engagement took place in the Indian Ocean off the Seychelles archipelago, north of Madagascar. Pinguin caused slight damage to Cornwall, before its fire on Pinguin caused an explosion and sank it. A British sailor was killed and about of the and Indian Merchant Navy prisoners on Pinguin, captured from over thirty merchant vessels, were also killed.

Manwaring) was a heavy cruiser of the Kent subclass, built in the mid-1920s. It had a displacement of , carried eight guns in four twin turrets, four anti-aircraft guns in two twin turrets, two four-barrel 2-pounder pom-pom guns and two machine guns. Cornwall had an aircraft catapult, three Supermarine Walrus amphibious aircraft and had a maximum speed of . Pinguin The auxiliary cruiser Pinguin (Captain Ernst-Felix Kr√ºder), was originally the freighter Kandelfels, which had been launched in 1936. After conversion to an auxiliary cruiser it became to the Kriegsmarine. Pinguin was armed with six guns, a gun, two anti-aircraft guns, four autocannon, two torpedo tubes, 300 mines and an Arado Ar 196 A-1 floatplane. By 15 January, Pinguin (Raider F to the British) had Norwegian merchant vessels by commerce raiding. It had captured three factory ships and 11 whalers belonging to the same whaling company. The prizes were sent to Occupied France where one was renamed and was used as minelayer for the German raiders in the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. In April, Pinguin sank three British merchant ships in the Indian Ocean, close to the Equator. Prelude After sinking Clan Buchanan on 28 April, Pinguin sailed north-west and on 4 May, fuelled and provisioned Adjutant, which was sent away to wait at a rendezvous near the Saya de Malha Bank. Just after on 7 May, Pinguin intercepted and sank the tanker British Emperor, which was on passage from Durban to Abadan, about east-south-east of Cape Guardafui. Emperor had sent a distress message and Cornwall, en route to refuel at the Seychelles Islands intercepted the message, when about south of the attack. Cornwall altered course to north-north-west and increased speed to . A plan was devised to catch the raider, using the Walrus spotter aircraft carried by Cornwall to close the raider's furthest on line and then search to cover the largest potential variations of the raiding ship's speed and course. Cornwall increased speed to , heading north between the Seychelles and the Chagos Archipelago. Vice-Admiral Ralph Leatham the Commander-in-Chief East Indies Station, ordered other ships to participate in the search. was sailing westwards at from Nine Degree Channel towards Socotra, while , which was north of Cape Guardafui, sailed for Eight Degree Channel, making for Colombo. , steaming from the Gulf of Aden, passed Cape Guardafui that morning at , to a position about south-east of the headland. The ship then turned south-west at towards the Equator, about from the African coast. Farther west, the armed merchant cruiser , patrolled from the Equator to a position to the south-west. On the afternoon of 7 May, the two aircraft on Cornwall flew reconnaissance sorties for three hours and then altered course to get on the line of the main Vignot search. This was plotted for a mean speed of for an hour after the time of the raider report, assuming that the raider needed an hour to sink British Emperor and then depart at full speed until dark. At Cornwall turned east- south-east and slowed to search on this line, before the moon set. At dawn, Cornwall sent both aircraft to search an area three knots on either side of the raider's estimated speed and turned east at (steaming away from the raider). At on 8 May, one of the aircraft sighted a ship heading south-west at , about west of Cornwall but did not report the sighting, until landing at about At Cornwall altered course to about west-by-south and increased speed to . The second aircraft was launched again at and at it reported that the unknown ship was steaming at and had hoisted the signal letters of a Norwegian motor-vessel Tamerlane, which the raider resembled but was not on the list of expected ships. Battle Cornwall increased speed to then to . At an aircraft was launched to give the bearing, course and speed of the suspected ship by wireless; the ship became visible from Cornwall at The ship began transmitting raider reports, claiming to be Tamerlane. Despite orders to heave-to and two warning shots, the ship maintained course and speed for more than an hour, until the range was fewer than yards. At Cornwall turned to port and the suspected raider made a larger turn to port, opening fire with five guns just before Due to mechanical failures, Cornwall did not return fire for about two minutes and was frequently straddled by shells fired at a rapid rate, before firing two salvoes from the forward The fore steering gear of Cornwall was disabled by a shell hit and after going out of control for a moment, the after steering gear used. By all of Cornwall's guns had opened fire, with the advantage of superior range finders and director fire-control systems, instead of local gun control. A salvo hit Pinguin, which blew up at and sank north of the Seychelles, about from where it had sunk British Emperor. Aftermath Analysis The commerce-raiding voyage of the Pinguin had lasted from 22 June 1940 ‚Äì 8 May 1941 and the ship sank or captured of About of shipping was sent to Germany as prizes. Cornwall returned to Durban for repairs until 10 June; the tactics of the captain of Cornwall in shadowing, attempted to identify and closing with Pinguin was criticised by the Admiralty. The crew of Pinguin had been skilful in disguising the ship and it was difficult to approach a suspicious, yet unidentified ship. A raider had the tactical advantage in deciding when to open fire, before it was unmasked and investigating ships courted danger, if the vessel approached from a direction favourable to a raider's guns and torpedoes. Allied ships were given secret call-signs and a system was devised for the investigating ship to refer to the Admiralty by wireless to verify ship identities. The new methods made ship identification much easier but took months to implement and similar events occurred, when ships were either allowed to sail on and turned out to be raiders or were intercepted and sprang a surprise on the British warship. The success against Pinguin and other raiders was due to the navy Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC) of the Naval Intelligence Division, at the Admiralty. The OIC tracked raiders, based on the position of the sinking of Allied merchant ships and by collating rare sightings and distress signals. German commerce-raiders kept radio silence, avoided common shipping routes, searching for independently routed vessels and tried to prevent their victims from transmitting wireless messages. From May to November 1941, the Germans lost Pinguin and two more commerce-raiders but Enigma decrypts by the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS;) was only involved in one sinking. German commerce-raiders used the (Home Waters) Enigma settings, known as Dolphin to the British, before departing and when returning to Germany. The seven raiders at sea in May 1941 had sailed in 1940, before Enigma intelligence became available to the British. When at sea, Enigma-equipped raiders used the settings if they broke radio silence, which Hut 4 at Bletchley Park never managed to penetrate. Atlantis, the third raider lost in 1941, was sunk by on 22 November after the British read U-boat signals in the setting, introduced in October 1941, to arrange a re-fuelling rendezvous. Casualties A British sailor near to the stern of Cornwall was killed when Pinguin opened fire. Among the men on Pinguin were and Indian merchant sailors, captured from over thirty merchant vessels.

Biography Adams was born in Stockton, California. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1949, after which she took courses at the California College of Arts and Crafts, University of the Pacific and the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1950 she moved to New York City and enrolled in the art program at the Brooklyn Museum where she studied under Max Beckmann, John Ferren and Reuben Tam. In 1956 she won a Fulbright scholarship to study in France, where she traveled with her husband, Vincent Longo, who is also a painter and printmaker. Adams taught at Bennington College from 1964 to 1993, and was appointed Visiting Professor of Art to Yale University's Master of Fine Arts program from 1990 to 1994. In 1995 she won the Vermont Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts. Her style, a mixture of modernism and abstraction, is described by Adams as \\"yield[ing] more to qualities than ideas, more to matter than its naming\\". She continues, \\"...I sense a release of potentiality, a release of more than we know....I conclude that of whatever else the artist's effort may consist, it abounds in restless projective extension; innately it bounds toward the vision of an anticipatory not-as-yet.\\" Exhibitions Adams's first solo exhibition was in 1954 at the Korman Gallery, later renamed the Zabriskie Gallery, under the ownership of Virginia Zabriskie. Adams had 20 solo exhibitions at the Zabriskie Gallery between 1954 and 1997. Additionally, her art was featured at various other venues including the Fleming Museum at the University of Vermont, Burlington (1977), the Rutgers University Art Gallery in New Brunswick, New Jersey (1978), and the Jaffe/Friede/Strauss Gallery, Dartmouth College, New Hampshire. In 1993 she was made a member of the National Academy of Design. In 1994, she exhibited at Dartmouth College's Art Gallery.

Reviews Her first solo exhibition at Zabriskie was described in the New York Times as \\"quiet, but intense,\\" while simultaneously abstract and \\"filled with lyrical allusions\\". Among the exhibited works was, Ribbons of Breath (1954), which used brightly colored, intertwining shapes in gouache and watercolor. Adams work was later characterized as \\"suggest[ing] a desire to assert the tangible actuality of what appears before the eye\\". In 1960, Dore Ashton asserted that Pat Adams's works detail her \\"visual experiences of nature and her spiritual insights about the cosmos\\". Ashton places Adams in the same category as artists like Odilon Redon and Mark Tobey, in that they each \\"seek to find what is 'within' the inmost secrets of the universe\\". Hilton Kramer further noted that Adams has a \\"mystical temperament\\" and is \\"extraordinarily inventive in conjuring up a world of delicate perceptions and inward feelings\\". Kramer also notes that her \\"paintings fill the eye with an almost hypnotic bath of completely delightful visual detail\\". In 2003, Adams exhibited a collection of new paintings at the Zabriskie Gallery including both small and larger works. Zabriskie describes this collection as \\"build[ing] gritty encrustations over rudimentary patterns and shapes...result[ing] in a friction between the particular and the universal\\". Some paintings included in this exhibition were Into the Garden (2003), Situation (2002), Following From (2002), and What Follows (2003). What Follows, in particular, has been described as \\"a soft, dusty mist vibrat[ing] through the space...almost impossibly, shift[ing] on occasion into liquid, giving buoyancy to the dot-filled oval and the circles in its field\\". A 50th anniversary exhibition of her first show at Zabriskie and the start of her relationship with dealer Virginia Zabriskie was held 2005. Martica Sawin's essay accompanied this exhibition, in which she describes Adams's paintings Arriving, (1994) and Late, New, Again, Round (1985) in the same in much of the same context as Ribbons of Breath. Adams's Sweetness (1990) \\"offers a microcosm of the many divergent possibilities one might encounter traversing the cosmos of the mind‚Äôs eye\\", and one of her newer paintings Be/Hold (2004) \\"has the power to draw the eye toward the minutiae of its variegated surfaces\\". Overall, Pat Adams's work has been well-received, and she's even been called \\"one of the most important abstract painters working today\\".

It began when Leander ordered an un-flagged freighter to stop for an inspection. The freighter raised the Italian colours and engaged Leander which sank Ramb I shortly after. Most of the Italian crew were rescued and taken to Addu Atoll, then Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Leander patrolled southwards to investigate more reports of commerce raiders. Background East African Campaign In January 1941, British forces simultaneously advanced from Sudan and Kenya into Eritrea, Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland, as the navy blockaded and bombarded Italian harbours. The port of Kismayu in Italian Somaliland was occupied on 14 February and sixteen Italian and German ships there were sunk or captured, except for one vessel. Merka and Mogadishu were occupied on 25 February and several hundred Allied merchant sailors were liberated. As Allied forces closed on Massawa, the Italian Red Sea Flotilla was ordered to break out and run for friendly ports. A group of Italian vessels consisting of the colonial ship Eritrea and the auxiliary cruisers and attempted to operate as commerce raiders while en route to Japan. The Italian squadron managed to evade the British blockade on 20 February and scattered into the Indian Ocean, Ramb I heading for the Dutch East Indies. HMS Leander was the leader of the of cruisers, armed with eight guns, ten guns, twelve Vickers machine guns in quadruple mounts and eight torpedo tubes. Leander also had armour plating over her turrets, deck and magazines and a top speed of . Ramb I Ramb I (3,667 GRT) was an auxiliary cruiser, a merchant ship adapted for naval service and lacked armour protection. Ramb I was armed with two guns and eight anti-aircraft machine guns. Ramb I was slower than Leander, with a maximum speed of . The ship had departed Suez on 10 June 1940 for Massawa on the Red Sea coast, from where the ship made short cruises along the coast of Eritrea but was mainly used for anti-aircraft defence of the port. As British and Commonwealth troops neared the port, Ramb I and Coburg (7,400 GRT), a German freighter, escaped from Massawa on the night of 20/21 February 1941 and passed into the Gulf of Aden. One ship was sighted near the island of Socotra off the Horn of Africa but it was considered too dangerous a location to attack. Prelude Acting on reports of commerce raiders in the area, Leander detached from convoy US 9 off Bombay on 22 February. Passing west of the Laccadive and Maldive islands, to a patrol area west of One and a Half Degree Channel. At on 27 February, Leander was steaming east, about north of the Equator and west of the Maldives. The captain, Robert Bevan altered course to the north to head for One and a Half Degree Channel, because news of the capture of Mogadishu had been received by radio on the previous day. Italian ships in the port might have sailed along that route for the Far East. Action At a ship was sighted ahead and Leander increased speed to , gradually overhauling the vessel. As Leander closed, a gun was seen on the ship's forecastle and the silhouette of the ship resembled an Italian Ramb-class fruit carrier. Leander went to action stations at and when ordered to identify itself ten minutes later, the vessel hoisted a British merchant flag. When ordered to give its signal letters, the ship hoisted four letters which were not listed in British signal books. Leander made the secret challenge but received no reply and the ship maintained its course and speed. A boarding party was standing by and at the ship was ordered to stop instantly but no reply was received. A few minutes later, the ship hoisted the Italian merchant flag and trained its guns on Leander. The cruiser was broad on the beam of the Italian ship and at was an easy target for its guns and torpedoes. At the Italian ship opened fire and thirty seconds later, Leander replied. The Italian fire was inaccurate and it was estimated that only about three shells were fired from each gun. A few shell splinters hit Leander, which fired five salvoes in a minute, then ceased fire to observe results. Leander made the flag signal \\"Do you surrender?\\", the Merchant flag was seen to be lowered and the crew began to abandon ship. Leander had hit the ship several times in the forepart and a fire burned, visible through a large hole in the side. A boat was lowered from Leander with a boarding party to try to save the ship and two lifeboats were seen leaving the vessel as men jumped overboard or scrambled down the side. An Italian officer in the water called out that the boarding party should not approach the ship, as it was burning and laden with ammunition. The boarding party laid off and as the fire spread, a big explosion before the bridge shot flames and smoke high into the sky, the ship settling bows first. As the fire burned, there was another explosion and five minutes later the ship sank under a cloud of black smoke. Leander recovered the boarding party and the Italian lifeboats, while edging away. Aftermath One Italian sailor had been killed by shellfire during the engagement; the Italian captain, ten officers and 92 sailors were rescued, of whom one man was seriously wounded, four were slightly injured. The seriously wounded man died in surgery during the afternoon and was buried at sunset. The prisoners said that Ramb I had been badly damaged by the shell hits and as Leander closed, the order to abandon ship had been given. Leander proceeded eastward and arrived at Addu Atoll next morning. The Italian prisoners were transferred to the oiler Pearleaf with an armed guard of nineteen ratings and an officer; the ship made for Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Leander was sent to investigate wireless direction-finding indications that Axis ships were in the vicinity of the Saya de Malha Bank, several hundred miles south- east of the Seychelles Islands and north-east of Madagascar. Coburg with a prize, Ketty Brovig, a Norwegian tanker, was spotted south-east of the Seychelles by a spotter aircraft from and both ships were scuttled when Canberra and Leander approached them.

History 1970s ‚Äì 1980s In 1977, Utah State University students Scott Watterson and Gary E. Stevenson founded Weslo, Inc.,\\"Proform, Weslo Health-Equipment Firms Sign a Deal to Boost Their Financial Fitness,\\" The Deseret News, November 15, 1994] a company that imported Asian kitchen and tableware, along with marble products. In 1979, Weslo began selling wood- burning stoves under the Fire King brand. In the 1980s, they began manufacturing trampolines, and then, under the name ProForm Fitness Products, treadmills, exercise bikes, indoor rowers, and home gyms. In 1988, Weider Health and Fitness acquired Weslo and ProForm, and in 1990, moved them into the current headquarters in Logan. 1990s In 1994, Weider sold ProForm and Weslo, along with Weider Care, to IHF Capital Inc,\\"ICON says it‚Äôs scrapping stock offering,\\" The Deseret News, September 27, 1996 a group led by Mitt Romney's Bain Capital, in a deal equaling US$450 million.

ICON acquired HealthRider in 1996,\\"ICON Health & Fitness to Acquire HealthRider,\\" The Deseret News, July 9, 1996 NordicTrack in 1999, and FreeMotion Fitness, Inc in 2001. 2010s In late October 2015, manufacturing activities at the Logan, Utah facility were moved offshore. This resulted in the laying off of more than four hundred workers. The former manufacturing space will now become a television studio to make advertisements, a showroom, and engineering and innovation offices. Some of the manufacturing jobs are now being replaced with industrial design, marketing, engineering and computer programming positions. In 2017, ICON created a partnership with Southern Virginia University where the company established an on-campus call center allowing paid employment and flexible hours for students to be employed while attending the University. ICON also donated branded fitness equipment to the student fitness center and the athletic training center. In March 2018, Icon sold the Altra Running brand to VF Corporation for an undisclosed amount. Legal History ICON Health & Fitness was central to a United States Supreme Court case regarding frivolous lawsuits and fee shifting. ICON Health & Fitness had sued Octane Fitness in 2009 alleging patent infringement. Octane was granted a summary judgement stating its designs did not infringe, and asked to be reimbursement for attorneys' fees. Ultimately, the Supreme Court held that Octane deserved reimbursement of its legal fees. ICON was held liable for $1.6 million in fees by the district court, which was later upheld on appeal.

He is a singer, musician, songwriter, producer, filmmaker, photographer, and graphic designer. He also served as director of Digital Media & Entertainment Programs for San Francisco State University Extended Learning. He has won ten Billboard songwriting awards. Early life Abaya is a native of San Francisco's Bernal Heights neighborhood. He became involved in music during childhood, taking up the piano at age six, the drums at age eleven, and the guitar at age twelve. He became involved in film and photography at the age of nine. At seventeen, Abaya enrolled at San Francisco State University. Initially a psychology major, he ultimately proposed a special major in multimedia, combining studies in film, audio, video, computers and electronics. He chose to call his major \\"Technology Interface\\", a name he selected from suggestions he received from members of American Zoetrope. Music Craig Abaya Abaya is a singer and cites his main instruments as guitar, piano, and drums. Although there is no direct influence on his passion for music, he would often hear his mother, a classical pianist, play the family piano, favoring the composer Claude Debussy. He also took up recording from a young age, moving from 2- and 4-track analog tape to ADAT and eventually to DAWs (digital audio workstations). At 17, he formed his first professional band, the grunge/metal trio \\"Apparition.\\" At this time, he also wrote and performed music with the local church youth choir. After disbanding \\"Apparition,\\" he founded the 4-piece group \\"The Basics\\" and later, \\"Abaya,\\" in an attempt to merge his divergent musical interests. He has won numerous songwriting awards in various genres, including 10 from Billboard Magazine. In 2009, Abaya released his first solo album, The Fine Art of Politics. In 2014, he composed and played guitars and bass on the DJ Qbert album, Extraterrestria. The same year, Craig released the single, \\"This Jail I Made.\\" In 2016, he composed and performed the orchestral music score to the film, Ambush. In 2018, his long time musical collaborator, Fred Wolford, expressed a desire to record a series of cover songs. As a result, Craig released a version of Neil Finn's \\"Truth\\" featuring Wolford and drums, Tom Edwards on bass, Leslie Caroline on backing vocals. In 2019, Abaya released the album, One Bus to Mercy, singing and playing several instruments and also hosting a number of guest artists. Despite his reputation for eschewing record labels (especially majors), Abaya signed, but later tore up, a contract with MCA/Universal Music Group and released this album on his own ARTifice music label (as with his previous releases). Late that year, he released his music video for the song \\"Restless Soul.\\" Originally, he referred to it as \\"the world's first crowd-sourced composition, because, years earlier, he had played a riff on social media and asked everyone what they thought the song should be about. He eventually wrote and recorded the song, including many of their ideas (mostly metaphorically). Shortly after releasing the video, showing Craig in solitude, recording himself performing all of the parts, the Covid-19 Pandemic rapidly spread and the irony of the visuals and title weren't lost on him. In 2020, Craig released his single and \\"socially distanced music video\\" of the Who song, \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", featuring Craig on guitar and vocals; along with vocalists, Nisha Anand, Lena Shabanova, Danelle Abaya, and Marissa Abaya. All performers recorded themselves from their respective homes.] In a description to the video, Craig wrote: ‚Ä≥We each recorded our own singing at home as we physically distanced. \\"'Behind Blue Eyes' was written in 1970 by Pete Townshend for his dystopian rock opera 'Lifehouse' and released the following year on The Who‚Ä≤s album, 'Who‚Ä≤s Next.' It‚Ä≤s written from the perspective of the opera's anti-villain, who is forced into lifelong emotional armor in a world in which something called \\"The Grid\\" (a futuristic worldwide computer network from which physically distanced humans receive everything including news and entertainment) is taken over by forces that wish to control it and the people. Pete's ideas for his opera were a mystery to everyone to whom he tried to explain it. It nearly drove him mad and nearly to suicide. 'Lifehouse' was visionary, not just because it predicted the web and social media but because it predicted the sinister ways in which it could be used. Some of us have lost loved ones to influences over our modern day 'grid.' We hope you enjoy our acoustic version of 'Behind Blue Eyes.'‚Ä≥ Abaya is a Grammy voting member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.  Filmmaking  Abaya started making films at age 9, starting with The Battle of McLaren Park, in which he spliced a scene of Clint Eastwood as a jet squadron leader from the classic sci-fi film, ‚Äò‚ÄôTarantula‚Äô‚Äô and earning his first television screen credit from films he shot age 12. In 2002, Apple, Inc. approached Abaya with an opportunity to make a feature film with his student crew. With a team of students and sponsors, he directed Bruce Hornsby Live at Villa Montalvo for DIRECTV. In 2003, Abaya served as concert shoot director for the feature, Joan Armatrading, All the Way from America. In 2006, Abaya became the producer/director of the Stern Grove Festival web series of videos including live performances, artist talks, and interviews. Joining him is his long time friend and collaborator, Philip J. Gallegos. In 2008, after having served as their live concert photographer for many years, Abaya became the resident filmmaker and concert photographer at the Bridge School. The school, which is for children with severe speech and physical impairments, was founded by Neil Young and Pegi Young. In 2015, Abaya began filming episodes of the web series, Marissa Anne the Media Fan. In 2016, Abaya served as director of photography, first assistant director, editor, and music composer for the 2017 neo-noir film, Ambush. In 2018, Abaya and 9 camera film crew filmed The Bammies Reunion Concert, featuring, Narada Michael Walden, Neal Schon, Sammy Hagar, Eddie Money, Pablo Cruise, Jefferson Starship and Brandeis Marin. In 2020, Abaya served as producer/director on the 10-part series \\"Stern Grove Festival - Best of the Fest\\" and the 3-part webinar titled \\"Cortical Visual Impairment\\" written by and starring Dr. Christine Roman- Lantzy. Craig also writes, directs and edits his own music videos. Craig is a new media council member of the Producers Guild of America. Photography Craig became interested in photography at age 9 when he received his first point-and-shoot camera. Among his first photos were shots of the aftermath of a police chase including officers making an arrest. Music being his first love, he wanted to capture some of his musical heroes. For years he did so with borrowed photographic equipment but eventually purchased his first professional camera. His early photos included such musical artists as The Who, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Alice Cooper, Tina Turner, Chris Isaak, Elton John, Tom Petty, Leon Russell and Heart. Occasionally, he would have the opportunity to meet and photograph non-music based celebrities including Gilda Radner and Monty Python's Michael Palin. In 2000, The Bridge School invited Craig to be their official concert photographer. In 2006, Apple.com published an interview with Craig about his photography. In 2013, San Francisco's Macworld/iWorld Expo made Craig their featured artist with a gallery of his concert films and photography entitled Craig Abaya: The Art of Rock'N'Roll from Analog to Digital.https://web.archive.org/web/20130108073851/http://www.macworldiworld.com/live- zone/digital-art-gallery/ Craig's photos have appeared in L.A. Times, Gentry Magazine, Rolling Stone Magazine, and other publications. Academics Abaya earned his first teaching experience at SFSU's Graduate Film school while he was still an undergraduate, but eventually took a full-time position teaching in Silicon Valley plus occasional stints at San Francisco State University and elsewhere. Eventually, he moved to SFSU College of Extended Learning, where he worked from 2000 to 2015, teaching and directing departments in Multimedia Studies, Music/Recording Industry, Digital Film Production, and Web Development.

The modes of a negative multinomial distribution, Statistics & Probability Letters, Volume 76, Issue 6, 15 March 2006, Pages 619-624, ISSN 0167-7152, 10.1016/j.spl.2005.09.009. Suppose we have an experiment that generates m+1‚â•2 possible outcomes, {X0,...,Xm}, each occurring with non-negative probabilities {p0,...,pm} respectively. If sampling proceeded until n observations were made, then {X0,...,Xm} would have been multinomially distributed. However, if the experiment is stopped once X0 reaches the predetermined value x0, then the distribution of the m-tuple {X1,...,Xm} is negative multinomial. These variables are not multinomially distributed because their sum X1+...+Xm is not fixed, being a draw from a negative binomial distribution. Properties Marginal distributions If m-dimensional x is partitioned as follows : \\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{X}^{(1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{X}^{(2)} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\text{ with sizes }\\\\begin{bmatrix} n \\\\times 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (m-n) \\\\times 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} and accordingly \\\\boldsymbol{p} : \\\\boldsymbol p = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\boldsymbol p^{(1)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol p^{(2)} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\text{ with sizes }\\\\begin{bmatrix} n \\\\times 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (m-n) \\\\times 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} and let : q = 1-\\\\sum_i p_i^{(2)}=p_0+\\\\sum_i p_i^{(1)} The marginal distribution of \\\\boldsymbol X^{(1)} is \\\\mathrm{NM}(x_0,p_0/q, \\\\boldsymbol p^{(1)}/q ). That is the marginal distribution is also negative multinomial with the \\\\boldsymbol p^{(2)} removed and the remaining p's properly scaled so as to add to one. The univariate marginal m=1 is the negative binomial distribution. Independent sums If \\\\mathbf{X}_1 \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{NM}(r_1, \\\\mathbf{p}) and If \\\\mathbf{X}_2 \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{NM}(r_2, \\\\mathbf{p}) are independent, then \\\\mathbf{X}_1+\\\\mathbf{X}_2 \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{NM}(r_1+r_2, \\\\mathbf{p}). Similarly and conversely, it is easy to see from the characteristic function that the negative multinomial is infinitely divisible. Aggregation If :\\\\mathbf{X} = (X_1, \\\\ldots, X_m)\\\\sim\\\\operatorname{NM}(x_0, (p_1,\\\\ldots,p_m)) then, if the random variables with subscripts i and j are dropped from the vector and replaced by their sum, :\\\\mathbf{X}' = (X_1, \\\\ldots, X_i + X_j, \\\\ldots, X_m)\\\\sim\\\\operatorname{NM} (x_0, (p_1, \\\\ldots, p_i + p_j, \\\\ldots, p_m)). This aggregation property may be used to derive the marginal distribution of X_i mentioned above. Correlation matrix The entries of the correlation matrix are :\\\\rho(X_i,X_i) = 1. :\\\\rho(X_i,X_j) = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{cov}(X_i,X_j)}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{var}(X_i)\\\\operatorname{var}(X_j)}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{p_i p_j}{(p_0+p_i)(p_0+p_j)}}. Parameter estimation Method of Moments If we let the mean vector of the negative multinomial be \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}=\\\\frac{x_0}{p_0}\\\\mathbf{p} and covariance matrix \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Sigma}=\\\\tfrac{x_0}{p_0^2}\\\\,\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\mathbf{p}' + \\\\tfrac{x_0}{p_0}\\\\,\\\\operatorname{diag}(\\\\mathbf{p}), then it is easy to show through properties of determinants that \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Sigma}=\\\\frac{1}{p_0}\\\\prod_{i=1}^m{\\\\mu_i}. From this, it can be shown that :x_0=\\\\frac{\\\\sum{\\\\mu_i}\\\\prod{\\\\mu_i}}{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Sigma}-\\\\prod{\\\\mu_i}} and : \\\\mathbf{p}= \\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Sigma}-\\\\prod{\\\\mu_i}}{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Sigma}\\\\sum{\\\\mu_i}}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}. Substituting sample moments yields the method of moments estimates :\\\\hat{x}_0=\\\\frac{(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}{\\\\bar{x_i})}\\\\prod_{i=1}^{m}{\\\\bar{x_i}}}{\\\\mathbf{S}-\\\\prod_{i=1}^{m}{\\\\bar{x_i}}} and : \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{p}}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{S}-\\\\prod_{i=1}^{m}{\\\\bar{x}_i}}{\\\\boldsymbol{S}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}{\\\\bar{x}_i}}\\\\right)\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\bar{x}} Related distributions * Negative binomial distribution * Multinomial distribution * Inverted Dirichlet distribution, a conjugate prior for the negative multinomial * Dirichlet negative multinomial distribution References Waller LA and Zelterman D.

Trouble with C-in-C ULFA's C-in-C Paresh Baruah has reportedly been speaking to various associates about a confederal agreement with the Government of India if the outfit's General Body approves. Raju Baruah is known to have strongly opposed talks for which a trouble has been brewing between the two. He was also believed to be publicly chastised by the C-in-C. Any decision-making power had been taken away from him and he said to be 'under treatment' - but in fact in quasi-detention - at the Mirpur Military Hospital. Death rumour In December 2000, the Assam Rifles issued a press release in Agartala claiming that Baruah was killed in a gun-battle between two fractions of the outfit in the Chittagong hill tracts in Bangladesh. The next day a person identifying himself as Paresh Baruah called up newspaper offices and broadcasting agencies from an undisclosed location and rubbished the Army's claim and said that it was nothing but a mere propaganda of the Indian government against the outfit's movement and nothing had happened to Raju Baruah. Arrest On December 4, 2009, Baruah with the outfit's chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa along with eight others, surrendered before the Indian authority near the Indo-Bangladesh border in Meghalaya. They were said to be taken into custody by the Border Security Force the moment they had crossed the border near Dawki in Meghalaya's East Khasi Hills. Release After one year of jail custody under Government of Assam, Raju Barua got bail and released on November 27, 2010. Raju Baruah, was accorded a grand welcome by hundreds of his supporters on Saturday when he came out of Guwahati jail on Saturday. Earlier, Baruah was granted bail in two Tada cases and in one CBI case. After being released from jail, Baruah left for his native place Bahjani in Nalbari district under special security cover. His family and friends came to the Guwahati central jail to welcome him. Baruah said he would be involved in solving the Ulfa problem along with others. Public reactions & surrender On December 5, 2009, Baruah along with the outfit's chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa and Rajkhowa's bodyguard Raja Baruah were produced before the chief judicial magistrate, Kamrup. He with Rajkhowa rubbished police's claim that they had surrendered. They emerged as heroes among the crowd for the denial of surrender. They got the biggest boost when public encouraged them not to surrender shouting - \\"Surrender nokoribaw\\" (Do not surrender). \\"Moi surrender kora nai aru surrender nokoruw (I have not surrendered and will never surrender)\\", said Baruah to the crowd.

His primary interests include the philosophy of David Hume, philosophy of religion, philosophy of language, epistemology, and moral philosophy. Millican is particularly well known for his work on David Hume, and from 2005 until 2010 was co-editor of the journal Hume Studies. He is also an International Correspondence Chess Grandmaster, and has a strong interest in the field of computing and its links with Philosophy. Recently he has developed a new degree programme at Oxford University, in Computer Science and Philosophy, which accepted its first students in 2012. He currently hosts the University of Oxford's Futuremakers podcast, winning a CASE Gold Award in 2019. From 2014 to 2017 he maintained EarlyModernTexts.com, a site which hosts the writings of famous Early Modern writers in a somewhat modified form to make the text simpler to understand.  Education  Peter Millican attended Borden Grammar School in Sittingbourne in Kent, United Kingdom. He read Mathematics and then Philosophy and Theology at Lincoln College, Oxford from 1976-1980\\\\. Staying at Lincoln College, Millican took the Philosophy B.Phil in 1982 (with a thesis in Philosophical Logic). Millican later obtained his PhD with a thesis on Hume, Induction and Probability, and also a research MSc in Computer Science, while employed at Leeds.\\"Peter Millican-About Me\\", 2 November 2008  Academic career  After teaching at the University of Glasgow from 1983, Millican was appointed in 1985 to a permanent Lectureship at Leeds University, teaching both Computing and Philosophy. After 20 years at Leeds, in 2005 Millican was appointed as Gilbert Ryle Fellow in Philosophy at Hertford College, Oxford, promoted to Reader in Early Modern Philosophy in 2007, and Professor of Philosophy in 2010. In 2009, he was appointed as the first \\"David Hume Illumni Fellow\\" at University of Edinburgh, a visiting position that he occupied during 2010‚Äì11. Research Millican is best known for his research on David Hume, notably on the development of Hume's philosophy, and on the interpretation of his writings on induction and causation. In a 1995 paper, Millican gave a detailed analysis of Hume's famous argument concerning induction, aiming to reconcile its apparent sceptical thrust with Hume's clear endorsement of inductive science: the previous interpretations that he was attacking had either condemned Hume as an inconsistent sceptic, or denied the scepticism entirely. His 2002 collection included a paper refining his analysis, and arguing against recent revisionary non-sceptical interpretations (particularly those proposed by Don Garrett and David Owen)‚Äîthis debate is still ongoing in his 2012 paper. The collection also emphasised the distinctive importance of Hume's work in the 1748 Enquiry, with the controversial implication that the Enquiry, rather than the Treatise, should be taken as presenting Hume's definitive perspective on the main topics that it covers. Millican has published a series of substantial papers with the aim of deciding the so-called \\"New Hume\\" debate, which has been the most prominent controversy in Hume scholarship over the last 20 years (\\"New Humeans\\" take Hume to be a believer in a form of causation that goes beyond the constraints of his famous \\"two definitions of cause\\"). The first of these appeared in a 2007 collection on the debate, the second in the July 2009 issue of Mind, and the third (responding to replies) in a 2010 collection on causation. The Mind paper concludes that \\"the New Hume interpretation is not just wrong in detail‚Äîfailing in the many ways documented above‚Äîbut fundamentally misrepresents the basis, core, point and spirit of Hume's philosophy of causation\\". A reviewer of the third paper judges that \\"Millican convincingly argues that none of his opponents' attempts to [answer his criticisms] are plausible. I am not alone in thinking the New Hume debate has run its course; as Millican says at the end of his essay, 'it is time to call it a day' (p. 158).\\" Much of Millican's other research, while not itself historical, has focused on Humean topics such as induction, probability, and philosophy of religion, but also on philosophy of language. His most significant non-Humean papers are on the logic of definite descriptions (1990), the morality of abortion (1992), and Anselm's Ontological Argument (2004).\\".\\"Peter Millican-Research\\", 2 November 2008 Philosophy and computing As an educator, Millican's most distinctive contributions have been on the interface between Computing and Philosophy, devoting most of his career at Leeds to developing the teaching of Computer Science and programming to students in the Humanities. In 2012 he championed a new degree in Computer Science and Philosophy at Oxford University (see Degrees of the University of Oxford). To encourage students in the Humanities to get involved in Computing, Millican has developed a number of user-friendly software teaching systems. Barack Obama autobiography In 2008 and 2009, some Republican commentators advanced claims that used Millican's software to claim Barack Obama's autobiography, Dreams from My Father was written or ghost-written by Bill Ayers. Millican insists the claim is false. In a series of articles in American Thinker and WorldNetDaily, author Jack Cashill claimed that his own analysis of the book showed Ayers' writing style, and backed this up citing analyses by American researchers using Millican's Signature software. In late October 2008, shortly before the Presidential election, Republican Congressman Chris Cannon and his brother-in-law attempted to hire Millican to prove Ayers' authorship using computer analysis. Millican refused after they would not assure him in advance that his results would be published regardless of the outcome.Thomas Burr, \\"Congressman Cannon questions Obama authorship\\" , Salt Lake Tribune, 11 March 2008 (courtesy link to article lede: )Obama book under scrutiny\\", United Press International, 2 November 2008 After some analysis Millican later criticised the claim, saying variously that he had \\"found no evidence for Cashill's ghostwriting hypothesis\\", that it was \\"unlikely\\" and that he felt \\"totally confident that it is false\\".

He had a difficult childhood and takes out his anger on the world by bullying others and taking advantage of his mother's position. Liang Mu Cheng (Ady An) also had a rough past, but still strives to protect her stepmother from learning that her mother's boyfriend sexually harasses her; Liang applies to college to escape this abuse. Guang Xi and Mu Cheng meet over a dispute about a car. Guang Xi believes that Mu Cheng is manipulative, and he swears to make her show her true colors. Guang Xi then makes a bet with his friends that he can get Mu Cheng to kiss him within 24 hours. He asks Mu Cheng out, and her stepmother forces Mu Cheng to go on the date since she fears that Guang Xi can shut down the school canteen, which she co-owns. Mu Cheng has her own problems with the date since Guang Xi had threatened to have her best friend, Hua Tuo Ye (Chris Wu), expelled from the school because he gave Mu Cheng a book from the school library. Guang Xi wins his bet, and Mu Cheng goes home to her stepmother, who encourages Mu Cheng to sell her body. She also mocks Mu Cheng's desire to play the piano again. Mu Cheng rushes out of the house in anger and runs to the college. She finds a piano in there and plays Air on the G String by Bach. Guang Xi, asleep in the room, hears her and is reminded of his father, who committed suicide years before. He forces Mu Cheng to stop and accuses her yet again of being manipulative. He then attempts to make Mu Cheng strip, but stops when she starts to cry. Guang Xi asks her to start playing the piano for him every night. Mu Cheng's stepfather learns about the arrangement and takes advantage of it. When Guang Xi is away, he goes into the music room and attempts to rape Mu Cheng, but is caught by Mu Cheng's stepmother and Guang Xi. Mu Cheng's stepfather tries to blame it on Mu Cheng, but Guang Xi knows that he is lying and the school gets involved. Because there is no evidence to prove Mu Cheng innocent or guilty, a Truth Investigation Court is held at the school to find justice. Guang Xi represents Mu Cheng as her lawyer. Tuo Ye finds evidence and presents it to the court, which helps to win the case. Problems arise when Guang Xi's mother doesn't approve of her son's relationship with Mu Cheng, and she forces an arranged relationship between Guang Xi and He Yi Qian (Ann Hsu). Guang Xi later finds out that he has a tumor in his brain that has been affecting his behavior. At this point, the chances of survival are very low unless he undergoes a new surgical procedure pioneered by He Yi Qian's father. However, in order to have the operation, he has to leave Mu Cheng and marry Yi Qian. He refuses, but Mu Cheng finds out and, wanting Guang Xi to have the life-saving operation, she leaves him, later finding out that she is pregnant with his son. Six years pass by and Mu Cheng lives a quiet life with her and Guang Xi's son, Xiao Le. During the operation that saved his life, Guang Xi lost his memory and doesn't remember Mu Cheng at all. He is now engaged to Yi Qian and has become a successful lawyer. Guang Xi starts to regain his memory after taking on a case where he defends his client from rape charges. After winning the case, he hears his client speaking about the victim offensively and begins to remember what happened with Mu Cheng. Infuriated, he becomes violent with his client and, as a consequence, is sentenced to 240 hours of community service in the same town that Mu Cheng and Xiao Le are living in. He builds a strong bond with Xiao Le, and Mu Cheng is reminded of why she loves him. After ten days of community service, Guang Xi leaves and returns to his normal life. On his wedding day with Yi Qian, he finds an SD card in his bracelet that had been with him for six years. The card contains photographs of him and Mu Cheng, which cause him to regain all of his memories. After realising that Xiao Le must be his son, and remembering Mu Cheng leaving him, Guang Xi becomes bitter and vengeful, telling Mu Cheng that she must marry him or else he will take away Xiao Le. While on a trip with Guang Xi, Mu Cheng discovers that Tuo Ye has been accused of killing a gang leader. She and Tuo Ye's mother beg Guang Xi to defend Tuo Ye, and he agrees reluctantly. He finds the real murderer, a girl who was kidnapped by the gang and was abused via unwanted use of drugs. Guang Xi intends to divorce Mu Cheng, as he believes that she is in love with Tuo Ye, but Tuo Ye tells him the truth about why Mu Cheng left him. However, Guang Xi still sends Mu Cheng divorce papers, but their son forces them to reveal their true feelings.

His contributions to supported employment Devlieger, P., Rusch, F., Pfeiffer, D. (2003) Rethinking disability: The emergence of new definitions, concepts, and communities(pp. 207-208). Philadelphia, Pa: Garant Publishers. include the establishment of the first ‚Äúsupported work‚Äù model in the fall of 1975 at the University of Washington while a doctoral student. Early career  Rusch received his undergraduate degree in psychology from the University of Oregon in 1971. He went on to earn a master's degree at the University of Oregon in 1972 in special education. Rusch completed his doctoral program in 1977 in special education and began his career at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He replicated his supported employment program in 1978 Rusch, F. R., & Mithaug, D. E. (1980). Vocational training for mentally retarded adults: A behavior analytic approach. Champaign, IL: Research Press. with the addition of an apartment-training program that provided employees with the training and support that they required to remain independent of adult day programs and segregated housing options typically available at the time. Eventually, Rusch turned his attention toward special education high school students and how they were being prepared for work. While a professor of special education at the University of Illinois he graduated numerous doctoral students who have assumed teaching and research positions at major universities throughout the United States, including an endowed chair. His early research career at the University of Illinois also included testing a model of supported employment that became the preferred approach for individuals with disabilities in the United States Widely recognized as responsible for the birth of supported employment as an alternative to sheltered employment, Rusch and his students influenced the way special education and rehabilitation funded training, evaluation and long-term employment in this country. Over a five-year period, Rusch and his students helped start over 125 supported employment programs in the states of Illinois and Kansas. These demonstrations led to over 100 publications by his students between the period beginning 1987 and ending in 1994. His first text was recognized by the President's Committee on Mental Retardation as the first text to overview the methods that should be used to promote employment among persons with disabilities, leading to his being awarded the American Association on Mental Retardation‚Äôs Educator of the Year Award. During this period he worked with Senator Paul Simon‚Äôs staff in crafting changes in legislation that promoted the emergence of transition service for high school students in an effort to better prepare youth to escape the potential of sheltered employment by being better prepared for work and independence after high school. Later career Over the past 30 years, Rusch and his students have been studying self-instructional strategies that utilize coworkers as change agents, and issues related to secondary education reform, including program development (cost-benefit analysis). He has also served as associate editor for numerous journals and has published over 200 books, chapters and articles. Rusch is one of the most-cited social scientists in the country; he was identified as the 15 most productive researcher in the field of mental retardation worldwide. Rusch and his colleagues at the University of Illinois established the Transition Research Institute, and later the National Transition Alliance, which was designed to improve transition services and outcomes, build states‚Äô capacity to form coalitions that better serve students with disabilities in the education mainstream, provide technical assistance to states implementing school-to-work systems change, and produce and disseminate information related to transition. Collaborators in the Alliance included the National Transition Network at Minnesota, the Academy for Educational Development in Washington, D.C., the National Alliance for Business, the National Council of Chief State School Officers, and the National Association of State Directors of Special Education. Research methodologies utilized by Rusch have included secondary analysis of the outcomes reported by the federally mandated Longitudinal Study of Youth in Transition, matched-pairs analysis of the effectiveness of a high school education, qualitative analysis of model programs, and meta-evaluations of model program outcomes. Several of Rusch's publications identified new methods of inquiry, including meta-analysis using repeated measures, withdrawal designs for use with intra-subject experimental designs, and new conceptual frameworks to better understand cost-benefit analysis of model programs. Rusch joined the Penn State faculty in 2004,http://www.ed.psu.edu/educ/espse/special-education/people/frank-r-rusch and is continuing his research related to utilizing cognitive strategies to promote learning among persons with mental retardation. He is also involved in a ten-year follow-up study of coworker involvement, a 25-year retrospective analysis of supported employment, and the examination of a secondary model intervention utilizing experimental and control subjects attending schools in the greater Philadelphia school district and surrounding area.

Some are popular hikes, such as Mount Rinjani, Mount Semeru, and Mount Kerinci, while others are much more obscure, and some do not even have official names. Some famous Indonesian mountains, such as Mount Bromo and Tangkuban Perahu, are not ribus because they are connected to higher peaks by high passes and therefore do not achieve enough topographic prominence.

Pedro L√≥pez de Monforte (; floruit 1103‚Äì35) was an Iberian nobleman and castellan, probably originally from the Rioja. He was most active in the Kingdom of Le√≥n, where he was appointed a count, the highest rank in the kingdom, by Alfonso VII sometime before 1 July 1131.Barton, 281. The identity of his family is unclear. His brothers were Jimeno and Lope L√≥pez, both majordomos under Queen Urraca.Reilly, 141, calls Pedro himself a \\"future mayordomo\\" as of 20 November 1119. He may have been a son of Lope √ç√±iguez and thus kinsmen of the house of Haro that held the Lordship of Biscay. The family of Pedro's wife, Sancha G√≥mez, is also unclear. She is known by name only from a charter of their daughter Countess Urraca, in which the latter granted some lands she had inherited from both parents to the Diocese of Burgos in 1173.Urraca refers to herself in this charter as filia comitis Petri Lopez de Monfort. A certain \\"countess Sancha\\" (Santia comitissa) made a donation to the monastery of San Salvador de O√±a on 19 December 1135 along with her sister Estefan√≠a and brother Rodrigo G√≥mez. This may be the widow of Pedro L√≥pez. Pedro was a courtier during the latter half of the reign of Queen Urraca. He witnessed nineteen royal diplomas between 1114 and 1125.Reilly, 219. On the death of Pedro Ans√∫rez in 1117 Pedro L√≥pez received the strategically important tenencia (lit. \\"holding\\") of Salda√±a,First recorded in saldania on 20 November 1119. which he ruled until 1126.At least until 12 December, although Reilly, 285, cannot find him there after March 1125. He may also have received Pedro Ans√∫rez's other holdings on the R√≠o Carri√≥n. The influence of Pedro and his brothers at court and their likely background in the Rioja has led some scholars to conclude that they were either exiled by Alfonso I of Aragon and Navarre or had first come to Le√≥n with Alfonso in the early 1110s.Reilly, 223‚Äì24. In 1119 Pedro was handed the government of Monforte,By 30 June. which he continued to rule until 1132.At least until 7 September. After the accession of Alfonso VII, Pedro joined his brother and the rest of the Leonese nobility in greeting the king and paying him homage in the capital city of Le√≥n, after the king had taken it from the rebellious supporters of the Lara brothers Pedro and Rodrigo Gonz√°lez.Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris, I, ¬ß4, cf. Barton, 126. Between 1129 and 1133 Pedro sporadically held other tenencias from the crown, such as: Ferrino,Per a charter of 2 April 1129. Mayorga,Per charters of 7 August 1129 ‚Äì 21 January 1130. R√≠o Seco,Per a charter of 17 March 1131. Salamanca,Per a charter of 21 January 1133. and Gat√≥n.Per a charter of 7 May 1133. Pedro was atop the list of confirmants in at least three royal charters in these years, indicating his high status at the court of Alfonso VII.The three occasions were 1 February 1132, 18 August 1132, and 2 January 1133. In 1130, before 14 March, Pedro was given the fief of Toro and held it consistently down to at least his final appearance in the records, and probably until his death in or after September 1135. Sometime while he was \\"ruling Salamanca\\" (mandante Salamancha), although the duration of this rule cannot be precisely dated, Pedro attempted but failed to install his own candidate in the vacant Diocese of Salamanca.Barton, 193. In 1133 the bishop, Nu√±o, disappears from the records, probably deceased. A synod held at Le√≥n in 1134 appointed Berengar of Toledo to succeed him, although Berengar did not take the title bishop-elect until the summer of 1135 and he was not consecrated by his archbishop, Diego Gelm√≠rez, until March 1136. The name of Pedro L√≥pez's candidate was also Pedro, and was said to enjoy the support of the \\"clergy and people of Salamanca\\" (clerici Salmanticenses et populus). The Archbishop of Toledo, Raymond de Sauvet√¢t, accused him of being \\"altogether unsuitable\\" (absolute simplex) and having granted church benefices to his supporters. Raymond suggested that Diego Gelm√≠rez at first supported the uncanonical bishop, who was only removed after lengthy negotiations.Fletcher, 287‚Äì90. It has been speculated that the fall of the bishop Pedro, the disappearance of Pedro L√≥pez from the records, and his brother Lope's loss of the office of majordomo all in 1135 may have all resulted from a military failure on the part of the count, and his consequent loss of the support of the king. The military defeats of the Salamancan militia in 1132‚Äì34 are recorded in the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris, but without mentioning Pedro L√≥pez.Fletcher, 290, cf.

Overview Gossner Foods specializes in producing varieties of Swiss cheese, but makes about 30 types of cheese all together. Sealed Milk Boxes for longer shelf life The company also produces UHT shelf stable milk for retail sale, and for the military. Gossner Foods has a contract to supply UHT milk to American troops stationed around the world, with the exception of the Persian Gulf region. Kuwaiti-based company Public Warehousing was awarded that contract, since federal law permits the U.S. military to buy non-American products in combat zones. The company is headquartered in Logan, and has plants in El Centro, California, and Heyburn, Idaho, and employs more than 500 people. Gossner buys milk from 300 farm families throughout Utah and Idaho. As of 2012, the chief executive officer was Dolores Gossner Wheeler. History Edwin Gossner Sr. was born in 1909 in the eastern region of Edliswil-Waldkirch, Switzerland. In 1930, he moved to Burke, Wisconsin, to work in his brother's cheese factory. After a three-year apprenticeship learning the techniques his brother acquired at the Swiss Cheesemaking School of Switzerland, Edwin took over the factory. The factory burned down in 1937, so Gossner moved to California, where he worked for the Rumiano Cheese Company. In 1941, Gossner opened a cheese factory in Cache Valley, Utah, a location he chose because the climate and elevation resembled that of Switzerland, and because of the abundant supply of local milk. In 1946, his factory was the largest Swiss cheese factory in the world, producing 120 wheels of cheese each day. In 1966, Gossner founded the current company, Gossner Foods.

Tel Aviv South railway station was the name of two former railway stations in Tel Aviv, Israel, which were situated in two different locations. The original station opened in 1920, then in 1970 it was relocated 2.5 km south-east, and it finally closed to passengers in 1993. History Original location The station, originally named Tel Aviv Custom House Station, was built in 1920 by the British Mandate Authorities. Its first location , at a distance of approximately 2.5 km from the Jaffa railway station, was facing the short Mikveh Israel Street, where the railway had followed a narrow curve between Yehuda Halevi Street and Railway (HaRakevet) Street. The construction of the station and its adjacent custom house was part of rebuilding the whole Jaffa‚ÄìJerusalem railway, which had been damaged during World War I, in standard gauge, rather than the original 1.05 metre gauge. This was one of the first civil engineering works the British carried out, once their governing mandate was established by the League of Nations. The new station and customs house were built to replace the existing Jaffa Customs House, which was old, congested and could not cope with the growing level of cargo traffic at that time. In 1935, an office building named Beit Hadar (in Hebrew, the \\"Citrus House\\"), the first steel frame structure in Tel Aviv, was built next to the station by architect Carl Rubin. From that point on the station was also known as Beit Hadar Station. During the 1948-49 Israeli War of Independence service on the Jaffa‚ÄìJerusalem railway was suspended and only resumed on August 7, 1949 following the signing of the 1949 Armistice Agreement with Jordan. On September 20, 1949, once the Tel Aviv North railway station was opened (which was later renamed Bnei Brak railway station), the station was renamed Tel Aviv South railway station. At this time it also became a terminus, as the section of track to Jaffa railway station was lifted and the Jaffa station closed. Relocation By the 1960s, the movement of trains on the Jaffa‚ÄìJerusalem railway was disturbing the growing vehicle traffic along the major Tel Aviv artery of Petah Tikva Road, later renamed Begin Road, therefore it was decided to relocate the station 2 km further out of town. The new station was opened on 26 November 1970. The tracks between the New Tel Aviv South Station and the original Customs House Station were lifted; however the Station building remained in place, in the central reservation of HaRakevet Street; the station name can still be clearly seen on the building, although the structure itself is now abandoned and neglected. Although the new station was quite spacious, with a large indoor passenger concourse, 4 platforms and additional sidings, it had only 16 rail services per day when it opened (8 in each direction). The station was poorly used due to its remote location far away from the city centre (unlike its previous location which was much more centrally located). This contributed to a significant drop in passenger traffic and in 1979 the passenger rail service to Be‚Äôer Sheva was halted and the service to Jerusalem reduced to one train a day in each direction. However, in 1990, new suburban service to Rehovot railway station was introduced. Closure In 1993, as part of the Ayalon Highway project the railway lines in the Tel Aviv area were re-aligned. New tracks were laid within the highway's central reservation, finally linking the coastal line from Haifa to Northern Tel Aviv with the railway line from Southern Tel Aviv to Lod and from there to Jerusalem, Be‚Äôer Sheva and Ashdod (from 2005 also to Ashkelon and Ben Gurion Airport) to the south; thus creating a continuous rail corridor from the north of Israel to the south through Tel Aviv for the first time. Previously, all rail traffic from the north of the country to and from the south had to bypass the entire Tel Aviv metropolitan area from the east. Since the new Ayalon railway bypassed the station, all passenger service to the station was discontinued and moved to the Tel Aviv Central railway station, though Tel Aviv South Station remained connected to the rail network via a short spur to the Ayalon railway. Later, additional stations were built along the Ayalon Highway, including the nearby HaHagana and Holon Junction railway stations. The station today Today the station is used as a training site for Israel Railways and occasionally as a stabling point. Tel Aviv South rail yard Located east of the historical 1970 station location is the active Tel Aviv South rail yard and stabling point which is situated in the central reservation within the two carriageways of Highway 1, south of Tel Aviv HaHagana Station and the Kibbutz Galuyot Interchange where Highway 1 merges into the Ayalon Highway.

He was a son of Somhairle mac Giolla Brighde, King of the Isles and Ragnhildr √ìl√°fsd√≥ttir. Other sons of Somhairle and Ragnhildr include Dubhghall, Raghnall, and possibly Amhlao√≠bh. Aonghus' father was the common ancestor of Clann Somhairle. The succession of this kindred upon Somhairle's death is uncertain. The Clann Somhairle imperium appears to have spanned from Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south. It is possible that Aonghus came to rule in the north, with Dubhghall centred in Lorne, and Raghnall in Kintyre and the southern islands. Although one mediaeval chronicle appears to indicate that Dubhghall succeeded Somhairle, Raghnall eventually gained dominance, perhaps at Dubhghall's expense. In time, Raghnall and Aonghus came into conflict, and Aonghus is recorded to have defeated Raghnall outright in 1192. The fact that Raghnall does not appear on record after this event could mark his downfall and death. In 1209, Raghnall's sons are recorded to have defeated the men of Skye, and the following year Aonghus and his sons are reported to have been slain on the same island. These events appear to indicate that Aonghus succeeded Raghnall in about 1192, and was killed by the latter's sons‚ÄîRuaidhr√≠ and Domhnall‚Äîafter which Ruaidhr√≠ seems to have secured control of the succession. As a result of the kin-strife between Raghnall and Aonghus, Raghnall appears to have forged an alliance with the family of Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland. One consequence of the struggle between the brothers seems to have been the extension of authority of the steward's family into Cowal and the islands of the Firth of Clyde. Although Ruaidhr√≠ originally seems to have held power in Kintyre, his later descendants are known to have held lordship in the Hebrides and the lands the main territories that came to be known as Garmoran. One possibility is that these territories were gained after Aonghus' death, and the annihilation of his line. Clann Somhairle dynast Locations relating to Aonghus' life and times.

According to the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, Somhairle and Ragnhildr had several sons: Dubhghall, Raghnall, Aonghus, and Amhlao√≠bh.McDonald, RA (2012) p. 182 n. 168; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 116; Anderson (1922) p. 137; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 60‚Äì61. Aonghus appears to have been a younger brother of Raghnall.Murray, N (2005) p. 288. The Clann Somhairle claim to the kingship of the Isles seems to have stemmed from its descent from Ragnhildr,Beuermann (2012) p. 5; Williams (2007); Woolf (2005); Brown (2004) p. 70. a granddaughterWilliams (2007) p. 141 ill. 14; Power (2005) p. 33 tab.; Brown (2004) p. 77 fig. 4.1; Sellar (2000) pp. 192 tab. i; Roberts (1997) p. 94 fig. 5.1. of the common ancestor of the Crovan dynasty.McDonald, RA (2012) p. 150; McDonald, RA (2007a) p. 50; Duffy (2004a). In the mid twelfth century, Somhairle confronted Ragnhildr's brother, Gu√∞r√∏√∞r √ìl√°fsson, King of the Isles, and wrested the kingship from him. Somhairle's coup resulted in the division of the Kingdom of the Isles between his descendants and Gu√∞r√∏√∞r's.Duffy (2004a); Sellar (2004). There is uncertainty regarding the succession of the Clann Somhairle leadership after Somhairle's death in 1164.

One possibility is that Dubhghall was succeeded or supplanted by Raghnall,Addyman; Oram (2012) ¬ß 2.3; Oram, RD (2011) pp. 156‚Äì157; Woolf (2007) p. 80; Woolf (2004) p. 105; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 198. whose recorded title of rex insularum, dominus de Ergile et Kyntyre (\\"king of the Isles, lord of Argyll and Kintyre\\")McLeod (2002) pp. 29, 31; Sellar (2000) p. 195; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 198; Paul (1882) p. 678 ¬ß 3170; Document 3/30/1 (n.d.). could indicate that Raghnall claimed control over the Clann Somhairle territories.Sellar (2000) p. 195. The name of Aonghus' brother, Dubhghall, as it appears on folio 16v of British Library Cotton Domitian A VII (the Durham Liber vitae): \\"\\".Stevenson, J (1841) p. 4; Cotton MS Domitian A VII (n.d.). Although there is no direct evidence that Somhairle's imperium fragmented upon his death, there is reason to suspect that it was indeed divided between his sons.Sellar (2000) p. 195; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 70; Roberts (1997) p. 97. Whilst the division of territories amongst later generations of Clann Somhairle can be readily discerned, such boundaries are unlikely to have existed during the chaotic twelfth century.Brown (2004) p. 75 n. 11; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 70; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 198. It is possible that the territory of the first generation of Clann Somhairle stretched from Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south: with Aonghus ruling in the north, Dubhghall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Raghnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 198. Attestations and extirpation The names of Aonghus and his brother, Raghnall, as they appear on folio 143r of GKS 1005 fol (Flateyarb√≥k): \\"'\\".Flateyjarbok (1862) p. 508 ch. 439; GKS 1005 Fol (n.d.). As with Dubhghall, the year and circumstances of Raghnall's death are uncertain as surviving contemporary sources fail to mark his demise.McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 78‚Äì79. In 1192, the Chronicle of Mann records that he was defeated by Aonghus in a particularly bloody battle.Oram, RD (2011) p. 157; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 247; Murray, N (2005) p. 288; Oram, RD (2000) p. 106; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 74‚Äì75; Roberts (1997) p. 98; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) pp. 197‚Äì198; Anderson (1922) p. 327; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 80‚Äì81. The chronicle does not identify the location of the battle, or elaborate under what circumstances it was fought. Nevertheless, it is possible that the conflict took place in the northern part of the Clann Somhairle domain where some of Aonghus' territories may have lain. Whilst the clash between Raghnall and Aonghus could have been result of Raghnall's rise in power and expansion at Dubhghall's expense,McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 74‚Äì75. the encounter could also mark Raghnall's downfall,Woolf (2004) p. 105. and perhaps even his death. seal of Alan fitz Walter, displaying an armed knight on horseback.Stevenson, JH (1914) pp. 16‚Äì17 pl. 1 fig. 1, 17; Macdonald, WR (1904) p. 320 ¬ß 2535; Birch (1895) p. 265 ¬ß 15731; Hewison (1895) pp. 38‚Äì39 fig. 2; Laing (1850) pp. 127 ¬ß 772, pl. 3 fig. 2; Liber Sancte Marie de Melrose (1837) pl. 7 fig. 2. There is reason to suspect that the inter-dynastic infighting amongst Clann Somhairle was capitalised upon by the ambitious neighbouring kindred of Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 246‚Äì247; Oram, RD (2000) p. 106. At some an uncertain date, Raghnall is known to have made a grant to the Cluniac priory of Paisley.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 247; Murray, N (2005) p. 288; McDonald, RA (2004) pp. 195‚Äì196; Oram, RD (2000) p. 111 n. 95; McDonald, RA (1997) pp. 148, 222, 229; McDonald, A (1995) pp. 211‚Äì212, 212 n. 132; Registrum Monasterii de Passelet (1832) p. 125; Document 3/30/3 (n.d.). This religious house‚Äîwhich in time became an abbeyBarrow (2004).‚Äîwas closely associated with Walter's family.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 247; Murray, N (2005) p. 288. Since Raghnall's grant appears to postdate the clash between him and Aonghus, it could be evidence of an attempt by Raghnall‚Äîwho may have been seriously weakened from his defeat‚Äîto secure an alliance with Walter's son and successor, Alan fitz Walter, Steward of Scotland.Oram, RD (2011) p. 157; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 247; Murray, N (2005) p. 288; Oram, RD (2000) pp. 106, 111 n. 95. Earlier in the century, the steward's family had accumulated substantial lordships near Renfrew and in northern Kyle.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 243; Barrow (2004). Possibly before Walter's death in 1177,Oram, R (2011); Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 243. or perhaps during the tenure of his succeeding son, the family seems to have extended its influence westward into Cowal, and beyond the frontier of the Scottish realm into the islands of the Firth of Clyde.Oram, RD (2011) p. 157; Barrow (2004); Brown (2004) p. 30. rook gaming pieces of the Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 161 fig. 6g, 185 fig. 12. The Scandinavian connections of leading members of the Isles may have been reflected in their military armament, and could have resembled that depicted upon such gaming pieces.Strickland (2012) p. 113. The fact that Bute seems to have fallen into the hands of this kindred by about 1200 could indicate that Alan capitalised upon Clann Somhairle's internal discord and thereby seized the island. Alternately, it is also possible that Alan received the island from Raghnall as payment for military support against Aonghus, who seems to have had gained the upper hand over Raghnall by 1192.Oram, RD (2011) p. 157; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 247. Alan's extension into the west may well have been a cause of concern for William I, King of Scotland. Not only were these islands outwith his own jurisdiction, but they formed part of the Kingdom of the Isles, and were technically within the jurisdiction of the Norwegian commonwealth.Murray, N (2005) p. 288; Oram, RD (2000) p. 106. It is possible that the alliance between Alan and Raghnall partly precipitated the king's establishment of a royal castle and burgh at Ayr in 1197.Oram, RD (2011) p. 157; Murray, N (2005) p. 288. This fortress extended Scottish royal authority into the outer Firth of Clyde region, and was probably intended to dominate not only William's peripheral barons,Oram, RD (2011) p. 157; Oram, RD (2000) p. 106. but also independent rulers‚Äîsuch as those of Clann Somhairle and the Crovan dynasty‚Äîjust beyond the borders of the Scottish realm.Oram, RD (2011) p. 157; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 112; Duffy (1993) p. 73; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 199. Alan's westward expansion appears to have suddenly ceased by about 1200,Murray, N (2005) p. 289, 289 n. 21; Oram, RD (2000) p. 132. perhaps partly in consequence of royal anxiety concerning the alliance.Oram, RD (2000) p. 132. In 1210, the chronicle reports that Aonghus, and his three sons, were slain in battle on Skye.Oram, RD (2011) pp. 168‚Äì169; Woolf (2007) p. 80; Brown (2004) p. 71; Sellar (2000) p. 195; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 80; Roberts (1997) p. 98; Anderson (1922) p. 387; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 82‚Äì83.

Ostensibly the name of Aonghus' nephew, Domhnall mac Raghnaill, as it appears on folio 47v of British Library Cotton Julius A VII: \\"\\".Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 102‚Äì103; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). The annal-entry of 1209 and the chronicle account of 1210 appear to reveal that the Clann Somhairle kin-strife was the cause of increasing instability in the Isles.Oram, RD (2011) pp. 168‚Äì169. These two sources could well refer to connected events.Power (2005) p. 39. For instance, they may be evidence that Raghnall's sons were attempting to extend their authority over the island,Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 248. and it is possible that it was Ruaidhr√≠ and Domhnall who overcame and slew Aonghus and his sons on Skye.Brown (2004) p. 71; Woolf (2004) p. 105. This last stand on Skye could indicate that Aonghus had succeeded Raghnall as the representative of Clann Somhairle, and that Raghnall's sons responded by eliminating their uncle and his line.Woolf (2007) p. 80; Woolf (2004) p. 105. If so, it is possible that Ruaidhr√≠ seized the Clann Somhairle succession after the annihilation of Aonghus' branch of the kindred.Woolf (2007) pp. 80‚Äì81. These accounts of Hebridean warfare may, therefore, signify a radical redistribution of the Clann Somhairle imperium.Oram, RD (2013) ch. 4; Power (2005) p. 39. The fact the two episodes took place at the same time a Norwegian fleet is reported to have ravaged the Hebrides could indicate that there was some sort of correlation between these events.McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 112; Power (2005) p. 39; Roberts (1997) p. 98; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 197. For example, it is possible that the Clann Somhairle civil-warring was capitalised upon by these sea-borne interlopers. In fact, one of the leaders of the Norwegian contingent was √ìspakr su√∞reyski, a man who appears to have been a member of Clann Somhairle. Aftermath The name of Aonghus' nephew and apparent successor, Ruaidhr√≠ mac Raghnaill, as it appears on folio 63r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 489 (the Annals of Ulster).Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1214.2; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1214.2; Bodleian Library MS.

In the second decade of the century, the Chronicle of Mann reveals that the wife of the reigning representative of the Crovan dynasty, R«´gnvaldr Gu√∞r√∏√∞arson, King of the Isles, was the sister of the bride of R«´gnvaldr's rival half-brother, √ìl√°fr Gu√∞r√∏√∞arson.Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 36; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 116; Woolf (2007) p. 81; Pollock (2005) p. 27, 27 n. 138; Woolf (2003) p. 178; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 85; Anderson (1922) p. 457; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 84‚Äì85. Although the precise identity of the half-brothers' shared father-in-law is uncertain,Oram, RD (2013) ch. 4; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 116‚Äì117. the chronicle describes him as a nobleman from Kintyre.McDonald, RA (2016) p. 339; Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 36; Oram, RD (2013) ch. 4; McDonald, RA (2007a) p. 73 n. 35; McDonald, RA (2007b) pp. 78, 116; Woolf (2007) p. 81; Pollock (2005) p. 27 n. 138; Duffy (2004b); Woolf (2003) p. 178; McDonald, RA (1997) p. 85; Anderson (1922) p. 457; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 84‚Äì85.

It is possible that R«´gnvaldr's kingship was formally recognised by Ruaidhr√≠ as the principal member of Clann Somhairle, and that Ruaidhr√≠ thereby established himself as a leading magnate within a reunified Kingdom of the Isles.Oram, RD (2013) ch. 4; Woolf (2007) p. 81. Such a development may have taken place at about the time of Aonghus' elimination. Ruaidhr√≠ was the eponymous ancestor of Clann Ruaidhr√≠.Duffy (2007) p. 10; McDonald, RA (2007b) p. 110; Murray, N (2005) p. 291; Duffy (2004c) p. 47; Oram, RD (2000) p. 117; Sellar (2000) p. 195; Murray, A (1998) p. 5; Duffy (1993) p. 77.

They operated both on their website \\"RevolutionMuslim.com\\" and through street preaching and protests. They frequently protested outside the Islamic Cultural Center of New York, a moderate Muslim mosque. The website was eventually shut down on November 2010, shortly after the arrest of one of the leaders. By November 2013, Morton, Zachary Adam Chesser, and al-Khattab‚Äîthe organization's leaders‚Äîhad all been arrested and convicted in US courts. Morton was released in 2015 and al-Khattab in 2016, while Chesser is scheduled to be released in 2032.  History  The group of 5‚Äì10 members was co-founded in 2007 and run by two American converts to Islam, Yousef al-Khattab (born Joseph Cohen) and Jesse Curtis Morton (who used the pen name Younes Abdullah Mohammed), who said their spiritual leader was Abdullah al-Faisal. Al-Khattab had been born to a secular Jewish family from Atlantic City, New Jersey. He later became an Orthodox Jew and moved to Israel, where he studied at an Orthodox rabbinical school. He and his family converted to Islam and moved to the Palestinian Territories as well as East Jerusalem. He is said to have worked driving a taxi, operating a pedicab, or running a restaurant. At that time, he took the Muslim name Yousef al-Khattab. Jesse Curtis Morton, a Columbia University graduate,Dina Temple-Raston, \\"'Revolution Muslim' A Gateway For Would-Be Jihadis\\" , 13 October 2010, PBS: Part 3, Terrorism Made in America, accessed 13 January 2013 was a friend of al-Khattab's. As he embraced Islam, he used the pen name Younes Abdullah Mohammed. The group promoted propaganda against the United States, Jews, Israel and others on its website, including moderate Muslims. The website was largely run by member Jesse Curtis Morton, aka Younes Abdullah Mohammed, a New York resident, but other contributors were from outside New York. In addition to propagandizing via the website and blogs, the group has distributed anti-Israeli literature and regularly protested outside moderate mosques in New York City. The mosques have called the police several times because of RM activities, but its members have not caused violence at the mosques. The website also served as a source for threats against Jews and Jewish organizations, particularly from al-Khattab. Legal and law enforcement officials in the US monitored the group, and described its activities at the time as protected by the First Amendment. The Anti-Defamation League has monitored the group and its members since 2006. A later terrorist influenced by Revolution Muslim was Terry Lee Loewen, who attempted to bomb the Wichita, Kansas airport in December 2013. In December 2009, al-Khattab expressed support on the website for Nidal Malik Hasan, the US Army psychiatrist accused of the Fort Hood shooting in November of that year. The Department of Defense classified the events as \\"workplace violence,\\" pending Hasan's court-martial. On December 12, 2009 al-Khattab posted a video on the group's website announcing that he had retired and was moving to Morocco, and that the group would be run by Abdullah as-Sayf Jones. According to a video Jones made, he was born David Scott Jones and grew up in Brevard County, Florida. He converted to Islam at the age of 16, taking the name Abdullah as-Sayf. After following the group online, in 2009, Jones moved to New York in 2009 and joined RM. In April 2010, Abdullah as-Sayf Jones publicly left the group; he announced having become a practitioner of Shia Islam. He has since spoken out frequently against Revolution Muslim and radical extremism. He has counseled Muslim youths against being attracted to extremist organizations. In April 2010, Revolution Muslim posted a statement on its blog from Anwar al-Awlaki, a prominent American-Yemeni cleric then in hiding in Yemen. US officials have alleged that he was connected to various terrorists, including the 9/11 hijackers and the Christmas Day 2009 bomber. The Fort Hood shooter had communicated with him when doing research on Muslims in the American military. Alwaki said in that statement, \\"America cannot and will not win. The tables have turned and there is no rolling back of the worldwide Jihad movement.\\" On October 30, 2013, al-Khattab pleaded guilty to using his position as a leader of the \\"Revolution Muslim\\" websites to use the Internet to place others in fear of serious bodily injury. This related to postings made in January 2009, in which he encouraged visitors to the website to seek out the leaders of Jewish Federation chapters in the U.S. and \\"deal with them directly at their homes.\\" Al-Khattab gave the names and addresses of synagogues in New York and another Jewish organization in Brooklyn. He also posted maps and directions to various Jewish facilities, and a link to The Anarchist Cookbook. Al-Khattab was sentenced to three years in prison in April 2014.  Analysis  Mia Bloom, a political science professor at the Pennsylvania State University's International Center for the Study of Terrorism, says Revolution Muslim may look like amateurs when compared with other extremist websites, but is still a threat. She has studied the process of its attracting dissidents to the website. \\"It may lead people who become radicalized by it to turn to other, more dangerous Web sites,\\" such as those run by terrorist organizations, she said, or to terrorist actions. She characterized the RM message as ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù and \\"misinformed\\" about Islam. Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations, said regarding the Revolution Muslim group, > \\"[It is] an extreme fringe group that has absolutely no credibility within > the Muslim community, they also cuss you out. In fact, most Muslims suspect > they were set up only to make Muslims look bad. We just have very deep > suspicions. They say such outrageous, irresponsible things that it almost > seems like they're doing it to smear Islam.\\"Scott Collins and Matea Gold, > \\"Threat against 'South Park' creators highlights dilemma for media > companies\\", Los Angeles Times, April 23, 2010  Influences  Law enforcement organizations followed the website to keep track of posters and others attracted to it. Colleen LaRose, also known as \\"Jihad Jane,\\" said she frequently watched Revolution Muslim videos on their YouTube channel. The scholar Jarret Brachman, a specialist on terrorism and contributor to Foreign Policy magazine, said she was the type of person fascinated by jihad but not belonging to a terrorist organization; he coined the term \\"jihobbyist\\" for such people in his 2008 study of global terrorism. He noted such activists may be motivated to take part in violence while not knowing much about the religion. A number of other prominent and lesser known terrorists were also associated with the site, including Samir Khan, Jose Pimentel and Carlos Eduardo Almonte. In November 2009 CNN published an interview about the organization and a video of Revolution Muslim protest activities from their website, which showed Younes Abdullah Mohammed saying, that U.S. troops were \\"legitimate targets ‚Äì until America changes its nature in the international arena.\\" He said that Osama bin Laden was a role model. CNN aired the previously scheduled program the evening after the Fort Hood shootings; no connection has been made between the Revolution Muslim statements and the shooting.  Threats  Revolution Muslim wrote threats on its website against Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the creators of the TV cartoon series South Park, because one of their episodes depicted Muhammad in a way they described as insulting. Zachary Adam Chesser, under his user name of Abu Talhah al-Amrikee, wrote the threat and had been active in posting other inflammatory material on the website. The Revolution Muslim website threatened the two men with violent retaliation and listed the addresses of both Comedy Central's New York office and Stone and Parker's production office in Los Angeles. The 20-year-old Chesser had a history over nearly two years of publicizing terrorist propaganda under his Muslim pen name on websites and blogs, and promoting violence against non-Muslims. A resident of Fairfax County, Virginia, he may have converted to Islam (The Fairfax Times and the Washington Post have published differing accounts). Friends and acquaintances said that in 2009, he became more extremist, adopting increasingly conservative views and traditional Islamic dress, and promoting them for others. On July 21, 2010 Chesser was arrested on federal terrorism charges.\\"South Park\\" Threatener Arrested\\" , The Smoking Gun (2010-07-21). Retrieved on 2010-12-12. Earlier that month he had been barred from boarding a flight to Uganda; he intended to fly on to Somalia and join foreign \\"freedom fighters\\" with Al-Shabab. After the terrorist group claimed responsibility for bombing a World Cup semi-final in Uganda, Chesser called the FBI and said he wanted to report information on the group.\\"Zac Chesser Timeline\\" , Washington Post, 2010, accessed 13 January 2013 He pleaded guilty to all charges in October 2010 and in February 2011 was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Yousef Al-Khattab used Revolution Muslim to post a series of threats against the Jewish community, going so far as to post lists of individuals and organizations, addresses, and suggested ways to harm them. Al-Khattab pleaded guilty to using the web to threaten the Jewish community in October, 2013.  Times Square car bomb  On May 1, 2010, a failed car bomb attempt was discovered by the New York City Police Department near the eastern corner of 1 Astor Plaza, the headquarters of Comedy Central parent company Viacom. The New York Daily News reported that police were looking into a possible link between the attempted bombing and the threats against Comedy Central. It turned out to be an unrelated event by Faisal Shahzad, a naturalized American citizen with ties to the Pakistani Taliban. Shahzad was arrested, pleaded guilty to ten counts, and was sentenced to life in prison. Revolution Muslim denied any involvement with the incident. Jesse Curtis Morton, aka Younes Abdullah Mohammed, the co-founder who still ran the group's website at the time, was in Times Square speaking out against President Barack Obama. But he said of the failed car bomb, \\"What do you think, I commanded somebody to blow up a building in the middle of Times Square? [...] It had nothing to do with the 'South Park' controversy. It was not an attack targeting Viacom.\\"  Hacking and closure  In June 2010, Revolution Muslim's website was hacked and redirected to an image of the Prophet Muhammed The United States shut down the Revolution Muslim website in late 2010 due to its threats of violence made against British MPs; it posted the addresses of the MPs. Chesser had been arrested in July 2010 and pleaded guilty to all federal charges, receiving a sentence of 25 years in prison. Mohammed (Morton) was arrested in 2011, convicted and sentenced in 2012 to more than ten years in prison.  Former members  Prior to the closure of its website, most of the original members left the group from late 2009 to early 2010. Some have publicly denounced the organization. Yousef Al Khattab, a co-founder, left the organization in December 2009 and went to Morocco. From there he published statements critical of it and its leaders. He said it had become a haven for what he described as \\"Muslim misfits.\\"\\"Backgrounder: Revolution Muslim Yousef al-Khattab\\" , Anti- Defamation League, 10 June 2010, accessed 10 January 2013 Hours after he pleaded guilty, he also posted a message on his Facebook page renouncing his former views as \\"disgusting\\" and not representative of Islam, and asking forgiveness for them. He served 85% of his 30-month sentence and was released from federal prison on August 2, 2016. While Yousef has denounced his former over the top interviews and online posts as well as sincerely apologizing for his uneducated and non-Sunni misunderstanding of Islam, he refused to become a government informant as can be seen in his sentencing minutes and pre-trial minutes. Jesse Curtis Morton, a co-founder, was sentenced to 11 1/2 years in federal prison. He became a prison informant for the FBI and was released after serving only 3 years of an 11 1/2 year sentence. After his release he began work as a counterterrorism researcher at George Washington University and was seen as a shining example of the countering violent extremism (CVE) industry. Since his denouncing of his former beliefs and ideologies, Morton has given support to the Ahmadiyya Movement on more than one occasion by giving them interviews and retweeting their website links. David Scott Jones (pen name Abdullah as-Sayf Jones) is another former leader who has left and denounced the organization. He left for religious reasons, saying he had become an Ash'ari Sunni Sufi and then a few months later an observant of Sh'ia Islam. He realized that Islam was not all about hate. He later explained in a collection of online posts that he was concerned with the direction of RM and did not want to be part of it. Today he actively speaks against organizations such as Revolution Muslim and works with Muslim youth to keep them from being attracted to extremist groups. He had a series of online debates with Jesse Curtis Morton, aka Younes Abdullah Muhammad, who fled from New York to Morocco in November 2010. Morton was arrested in Morocco in 2011 and tried in federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia, for soliciting murder through the Revolution Muslim website, as he was part of the threats against the South Park creators and published addresses related to them. He pleaded guilty to three charges.\\"New York man guilty of South Park murder threat\\", ABC News, 9 February 2012, accessed 10 January 2013  References   External links  * Archives of the old website Category:Islamist groups Category:Abdullah Yusuf Azzam Category:Organizations based in New York (state) Category:Islam and antisemitism Category:Defunct websites Category:Islamic activist organizations Category:Islamic organizations based in the United States ","title":"Revolution Muslim"},{"id":"24994373","text":"Wen-Pin Hope Lee (; born 1967) is a Taiwanese composer.

Opened in August 2013 with 126 hospital beds, the Kaiser Permanente facility is planned to later expand to 174 beds. It was designed by Ellerbe Becket Architects and Petersen Kolberg & Associates Architects/Planners. The $220 million hospital includes Kaiser‚Äôs Sunset Medical Office that opened in 1987 on the west side of the Portland metropolitan area. History Kaiser-Permanente broke ground on their Sunset Medical Office on in what was then unincorporated Washington County in August 1986. The facility, a two-story brick building designed by Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership, was built at a cost of $5.2 million and opened in 1987. The organization originally planned to build a hospital on the site in addition to their medical offices. It dropped those plans in the mid-1990s and sold 35 acres (14 ha) of the site to Trammell Crow Company in 1997 for construction of apartments. In June 2005, Kaiser announced plans to build a 138-bed hospital at the site that had since been annexed by Hillsboro after deciding not to build a hospital in Vancouver, Washington. Kaiser had planned to purchase from sportswear maker Nike near Beaverton for construction of a hospital, but Nike backed out after Beaverton planned to annex Nike's headquarters. Hillsboro earlier rejected proposals by Providence Health & Services to build a new hospital in the Orenco section of the city, with Hillsboro-based Tuality Healthcare opposed to the Providence plan due to the proximity to its Tuality Hospital (the only hospital in the city), in downtown Hillsboro. However, Tuality was not opposed to Kaiser's hospital proposal, as it did not view the health maintenance organization's hospital as a direct competitor. The original plans in Hillsboro called for a $285 million facility on which construction would have begun in fall 2006, with opening in spring 2009. Once completed, the first phase was to have of space, and would grow from an initial 138 beds. The main hospital building, two parking garages, a medical office building, and a hospital support building were to be part of the first phase of construction, with additional buildings and hospital beds to be added later to bring the total size of the campus to . The city rejected the initial design plans as too industrial in design and did not grant a request to allow for structures over in height. Hillsboro‚Äôs planning commission approved a revised plan in November 2005 that included one building planned to be tall along with aesthetic improvements to the campus, and the city council approved the plans the following month. Kaiser would also be responsible for some infrastructure improvements in the Tanasbourne area to mitigate the increased traffic generated by the hospital complex. In 2006, competitors Legacy Health Systems and Providence, who both operate hospital networks in the Portland metropolitan area, opposed the project and attempted to have the state not issue a certificate of need required to build a hospital in Oregon. After public hearings and arguments by both sides, Kaiser was issued the certificate of need in January 2007, but pushed back the opening to 2010. In September 2007, Kaiser decided to review its plans for the project and put the hospital on hold. Kaiser worked to redesign the hospital and in September 2008 announced that construction of the facility would begin in 2009. The new design called for an initial 121 beds and grow to 174 at an estimated cost of $285 million. Hillsboro approved the new plans for a smaller hospital in February 2009, with Kaiser to begin construction in June 2009. The new plans would have the $242 million hospital open in 2013 with 126 hospital beds on a campus of , with full build out on the site to be completed by 2040. On June 17, 2009, construction began with a groundbreaking ceremony attended by local dignitaries including Hillsboro mayor Jerry Willey and Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski. After excavation during the summer, construction of the steel and concrete frame began in 2010. As of August 2010, completion was scheduled for spring 2012, with construction costs totaling $220 million out of a total cost of $360 million. Kaiser announced in April 2012 that construction would end in summer 2012 and the hospital would open in August 2013 at a cost of $344 million. The facility held open houses in May 2013 and set the opening date as August 6, 2013. In May 2013, the hospital was certified as a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold building. The hospital opened on August 6, 2013. Design Located on Evergreen Parkway at Stucki Avenue just west of 185th Avenue, the medical center includes Kaiser‚Äôs Sunset Medical Office in the Tanasbourne neighborhood. The facility is expected to employ about 1,100 people. The facility was the first new hospital in Washington County in almost 40 years. The designs and artwork incorporate modern theories of creating an environment that is pleasing to assist in the healing process, which includes an exterior plaza that can host a farmer's market. Certified as LEED Gold, the medical center's green features include water retention tanks, wood composite insulation, and renewable energy, among others, at the $344 million hospital. Ellerbe Becket Architects and Petersen Kolberg & Associates Architects/Planners designed the facility and Andersen Construction was the general contractor. The design of the hospital included templated floor plans that re-used existing interior designs employed at other Kaiser hospitals, which helped reduce costs. Unlike many California based Kaiser facilities, the Westside Medical Center has a brick and glass exterior, and a more extensive waterproofing system underground. The hospital opened with 126 hospital beds in a building, but is planned to expand to 174 beds inside a facility. This expansion will be accomplished with a planned construction of a second patient tower. The second tower will also be triangular in shape and connect to the main hospital building. The main hospital building is in the middle portion of the southern half of the campus, with the first patient tower to the west along 194th Terrace. The first parking structure is also on that street, north of the patient tower, while the central utility plant is in the southeast corner. When all phases are completed, the campus will include a nearly parking structure and two other buildings totaling with the campus covering over on the site. Departments include surgery, intensive care, emergency, labor and delivery, neurology, orthopedics, cardiology, and allergy. The campus also includes a public health resources center and a pharmacy.

She is most commonly associated with fellow Belgian comics writer Herg√© (Georges Remi) and his Adventures of Tintin series.  Early life  She was born Josette Marie Louise Nondonfaz in Spa, Belgium. There she studied drawing and portraiture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Li√®ge. She married Joseph Baujot in 1944, with whom she moved to Argentina. The couple bought a vineyard there and had a son. Her life changed abruptly when Joseph was shot dead while hunting in 1953. It was reported that he had been shot by members of the French or Belgian resistance who had tracked him down; however Joseph lived long enough to inform police that he had been accidentally shot by his friend. Josette returned to Brussels after his death. She eventually found work at the Herg√© Studios. In Brussels she met cartoonist Joseph Loeckx, also known by his nom de plume Jo-El Azara, creator of the character Taka Takata. He would remain her lifelong companion. Career Originally, Herg√© drew the cartoons for Tintin completely in black and white. As the popularity of the cartoons increased, he hired colorists to add color to the work. Baujot was hired in 1953, and eventually became Herg√©'s main colorist, along with Edgar Pierre Jacobs. She arrived as work was being completed for Destination Moon (Objectif Lune). Herg√© was eventually very pleased with the outcome of her coloring. Baujot developed a distinct style of coloring, involving mixing of shades as opposed to the standard use of stark, contrasting colors. She would hone her technique throughout the upcoming Tintin projects, the next being Cigars of the Pharaoh (Les Cigares du Pharaon, 1955). Despite having differences and often arguing over ideas and plans, Herg√© admired and respected Baujot, and they remained close friends.

He was one of the founders of Sambo, a martial art technique developed in the Soviet Union. Kharlampiyev worked as a physical education trainer at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, and also was a student of boxing, fencing, acrobatics, and mountaineering. In 1938, Kharlampiyev presented Sambo to the USSR All-Union Sports Committee, which recognized the martial art as an official sport. Biography Kharlampiyev's grandfather, Georgy Yakovlevich Kharlampiyev, was a gymnast and fist-fighter. For many years, he collected, studied, and classified various techniques of hand-to- hand combat and self-defense. –•–∞—Ä–ª–∞–º–ø–∏–µ–≤—ã: –≥–∏–º–Ω–∞—Å—Ç—ã, –±–æ–∫—Å—ë—Ä—ã, –±–æ—Ä—Ü—ã, –∫—É–ª–∞—á–Ω—ã–µ –±–æ–π—Ü—ã –∏ –¥–∞–∂–µ - –∞–ª—å–ø–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—ã Kharlampiyev's father, Arkady Georgievich Kharlampiyev (1888-1936), graduated with honors from the Academy of Arts and was sent to Paris at the state's expense to continue his studies. After a while, due to lack of funds to continue his studies, he began to fight in a professional European boxing ring. He soon became the champion of France, and then Europe (in the absolute category). After that he returning to Russia to begin making boxing popular. He was considered one of the founders of the Russian boxing school. From his early childhood, Kharlampiyev was trained by his grandfather and father. At the age of six, he acted in a group of aerial acrobats in a circus. By 16, he had already become a versatile athlete and a well-trained wrestler and boxer. Sambo Kharlampiyev dedicated his life to the creation and development of a new application of martial arts - Sambo. At the beginning of 1920, he began to collect and systemize national games containing methods of struggle, and in 1934 to describe and classify sports and fighting techniques. In 1936, he graduated from the Russian State University of Physical Education, Sport, Youth and Tourism (Department of Judo directed by Vasili Oshchepkov). Starting in 1935, Kharlampiev led judo training at the Moscow Palace of Sports, known as the \\"Wings of the Soviets\\". From 1945 to 1952, he worked the senior manager of the Central \\"Dynamo\\" Council. From 1953 on, he was Associate Professor of the Department of Physical Education. Kharlampiyev created the Sambo system including a sports subsystem (which is the foundation). Sambo is commonly practiced by the Soviet, and later Russian, militaries (which was seen as the target application). The sport subsystem eventually became known as Sambo Wrestling (or simply Sambo), and the combat form as Combat Sambo. By creating the system of Sambo, Anatoly Kharlampiyev carefully studied judo and mastered it in practice. In judo, he saw evidence of a new type of combat clothing, enriched with the most effective techniques of other forms of struggle. He mastered judo under the direction of Vasili Oshchepkov during a long-term stay in Japan and practiced in the Kodokan Judo school. During his years as physical training instructor at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East (TAS) and the International Society of red stadium builders (OSMKS), Kharlampiyev continued to study different kinds of combat. Comprehension of the essence of the struggle (both science and art) assisted learning techniques and tactics of fights outstanding fighters (Ivan Poddubny, Klimenty Buhl et al.). For a number of years Kharlampiyev traveled to the Central Asian and Caucasus republics for the study of national kinds of struggle. He studied and systematized techniques and training methods. He took part in the competitions. With a body weight of 72 kg, he sometimes beat heavyweights. The 1983 film Invincible was based on these journeys, and the character \\"Andrei Khromov\\" was based on Kharlampiev. His role was played by Andrei Rostotsky. World War II The development of a new kind of wrestling was halted by World War II when Anatoly Kharlampiev volunteered and was sent to the front in the Red Army on July 7, 1941. Since September 1941 he was with the 18th Infantry Division of the Leningrad region of Moscow. After the war After the war, Anatoly Kharlampiyev stepped up his activities on the development and spreading of a new kind of wrestling. Since 1947, the holding of the USSR championships continued. In 1947, the Second All-Union gathering of trainers was held on the initiative of Kharlampiyev. During this conference it was decided that the new type of combat clothing, cultivated in the Soviet Union would be called Sambo (abbr. From the \\"self-defense without weapons\\"). At the same assembly, it was decided to create a Federation of Sambo. Sambo competitions became a regular occurrence in the cities, regions and republics of the Soviet Union. It began publication of educational materials for Sambo. Sports and educational work with young people, young people and security forces in the sections Sambo, which was held by Anatoly Abramovich (head coach of the anti DSO \\"Wings of the Soviets\\" (Moscow); senior \\"Dynamo\\" CA coach (1945-1952)) and his companions, He boosted the number involved in the fight Sambo in the USSR. In those years, Anatoly Kharlampiev may have been one of the most prolific Sambo coaches. In 1953, Kharlampiyev became Associate Professor of Moscow Power Engineering Institute (MPEI). Since that time, Sambo began to spread to universities in Moscow and other cities of the USSR. Death Kharlampiyev died on April 16, 1979.

He started his career as a traveling \\"one-man band\\", but later changed his focus to making documentaries and films about his life. Life and work Marc Israel was born and raised in Cinnaminson Township, New Jersey. A graduate of the New School for Social Research, Israel spent the remainder of his twenties hitchhiking the world and performing as a one-man-band. His often-improvised songs were of a humorous and sometimes bawdy nature, based on early American musical forms such as Delta Blues and primitive country music. Beginning in 1994, Israel lived and performed with Allen Ginsberg on and off until the poet's death. His first feature-length film, How I Spent My Summer Vacation (1997), documented one of his cross-country hitchhikes as well as the effects and aftershocks of Ginsberg's passing on his close friends. It featured conversations with futurist Geoff Manaugh, poet Anne Waldman, and a host of strangers in their cars. In 1999, due to mounting stage fright, Israel ceased performing music, but continued creating films of various lengths, genres, and styles, often focusing on his own emotional troubles, presented with candor and humor. In 2000, he completed the low-budget comic/horror fiction film Frankenstein's Little Monster, a re-visioning of Mary Shelley's novel focusing on the monster's frenzied sexual desires and eventual spiritual awakening. It included Beat Generation poet Peter Orlovsky in the role of Hindu holyman Rick Shaw. The documentary La Hamburguesa Magica (2003) presents a plagued and near-fatal Mexico misadventure undertaken by Israel and then-girlfriend Elyse Allen. By film's end they have separated and Marc is in a mental hospital. Nearer My God to Thee (2005), then follows a heartbroken and fragile Israel to Brazil, where he is seeking the help of famed \\"miracle man\\" Jo√£o de Deus (medium) (John of God). It also explores the previous year's difficulties leading to this journey, including tendinitis, an invasion of ants into his house, an accidental wound to his penis, the aforementioned heartbreak, and a newly failed relationship.http://www.lizbeck.net/2007/10/14/documentary-film- making/ A Balancing Act (2007), which won \\"Best Comedy Documentary\\" at both the Atlanta International Documentary Film Festivalhttp://www.docufest.com/awards.html and Montezuma International Film Festival, begins by tracking Israel as he presents Nearer My God to Thee at festivals, but departs from his trademark self-surveillance style as he learns about a mysterious event in Vietnam where contestants balance various objects on motorbikes. His curiosity leads him first to the Museum of Ephemerata in Texas where the curators restore him to health with their life-affirming attitudes and endless supply of Kombucha tea, then to Iowa City where he develops a strong kinship with an eccentric university scholar who lectures on the balancing contest, and eventually to Southeast Asia, hitchhiking through Thailand, Cambodia, and finally Vietnam, where the contest takes place. After A Balancing Act, Marc Israel has created a series of short films including Encounters With Sarahhttp://www.artslant.com/ny/articles/show/4708(commissioned by Found Magazine founder Davy Rothbart), a music video about his cat Barkley,http://www.neatorama.com/2008/07/29/barkley-the-cat a documentary about folk music legend Michael Hurley, and \\"an epic sea odyssey\\" filmed entirely in his bathtub using rubber duckies. While Israel's personal documentaries have been lauded for their emotional honesty,http://www.dpselfhelp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t;=8889 some viewers have questioned the legitimacy of Israel's claims to mental illness. \\"Supposedly suffering from an undiagnosable condition....the more he dwells on himself, the more convinced he is (and the less convinced the viewer is) of his mysterious handicaps\\", writes one film critic. Alternately, there has been some speculation about whether the Museum of Ephemerata's \\"unique\\" Kombucha brew really had the positive mental health effects Israel claimed. \\"I no longer wanted to kill myself or anyone else. It caused a 'rebirth of wonder' within my whole molecular structure\\", says Israel in A Balancing Act. Mr. Israel started his own Kombucha brand, Phenomenal World Kombucha (named after his production company Phenomenal World Cinema), but halted operations due to an overwhelming increase of supply and demand inspired by word-of-mouth, association with his films, and endorsements by Michael Hurley.

Composed of men and women, the band performs at all SIU football home games and marches in parades for SIU homecoming, the Du Quoin State Fair and Carbondale Lights Fantastic. The band has also performed in halftime programs for the Chicago Bears, St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Rams, as well as presidential addresses in Carbondale by Bill Clinton. The band is known for its \\"Saluki Salute to America\\", a patriotic medley that opens with \\"America The Beautiful\\" and then moves to \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", performed by two solo, antiphonal trumpets. \\"Salute to America\\" has been performed by the band at many functions, including the 1982 World Series. History The Marching Salukis began as a military-style marching band, and began evolving into its present form around 1965 under the directorship of Donald Canedy. Tuxedo jackets and homburg hats were adopted as the uniform, arrangements of jazz, big band and rock music started to come into use, and a loose approach to marching drills was taken. Many of the early arrangements were written by Grammy-winning composer Glen Daum, a trombonist in the band in the 1960s, and are still in use.SIUC alum sings praises of liberal arts education In the late 1960s to 1997, the band was led by Michael D. Hanes. Other directors have included Nick Koenigstein(1967-68 while Hanes was on military tour of duty), Dan Philips (assistant 1988-1997), Travis Almany (1997), Matt Bishop (1998), Thomas Bough (1999-2005), and Andrew Tucker (2005 - 2009). In 2009 The School of Music hired Dr. George Brozak, former director of The Mighty Sound of the Southeast, as the new director. The Marching Salukis featured several innovations in its early years, including a baby grand piano on wheels, wheeled percussion carts (the \\"Rhythm on Wheels\\", which included a pair of timpani) and a violist (usually a non-musician playing a dummy instrument although Dane Ronvik actually performed on cello in the early 1980s). The tuxedo uniform has gone through several alterations over the years. For a time, there were different colored jackets for the various sections of the band: Black band (low brass and tenor and baritone saxophones), red band (high brass, alto saxophones and the other woodwinds), plaid band (percussion) and white band (drum majors). In 1989, the uniform was changed to maroon jackets (former black band), white jackets (former red band) and maroon vests. The drum majors wear all-white tailcoats. The uniform was changed again in 2010 to coincide with the opening of SIUC's new Saluki Stadium. The new uniform is a modern interpretation of the Marching Saluki tradition of tuxedo-style attire. The new uniform consists of a tuxedo style top which emulates a jacket, vest, ruffle front shirt and bow tie, and black pants. The drum majors wear white coats and the instrumentalists wear maroon coats. Unlike previous incarnations which included a homburg hat, the new design incorporates a fedora. In the 2015 marching season, the use of drum major batons was incorporated into the pre-game show. In 2013, the band received a gracious grant from the Chancellor for new instruments. All instruments used by the band are new. All members now using instruments provided by the school, paying only a modest maintenance fee. In the seven years under the direction of Brozak, the band has grown and in 2014 had over 200 members. In recent decades, the marching drills on the field have become more contemporary with innovative formations, and the addition of a snare drum line. However, the parade drills still feature some scramble band band remnants, namely the \\"Saluki Scatter\\", during which the band members break formation and greet bystanders on the parade route. In the late 1980s, a flag corps, the Saluki Silks, became the official color guard to the band. Then in 2011, a dance team, the Saluki Dazzlers, became the official dance team of the band. Administered by the SIU School of Music, the Marching Salukis are a music class (MUS 011), and members receive one course credit for participation in the band. Membership in the band is open to all student musicians, music majors or not, while the drum line, Salukis Dazzlers, and Saluki Silks is by audition. Members of the Marching Salukis in the 2015 season also received a $500 stipend for membership.SIUC : School of Music Saluki Pep Band During basketball season, the Saluki Pep Band performs at all home games of the Salukis' men's and women's basketball teams.

It is now part of 2GO Travel, subsidiary brand of the 2GO Group. Supercat was the sister company of SuperFerry and Cebu Ferries. Supercat operated 7 vessels in 7 ports around the Philippines. Brief history 200px Batangas - Calapan route is one of the most important shipping routes in the Philippines. During the early 1990s, the route was dominated by a single large shipping company. Travelling during those days could take up to 3 hours and be uncomfortable. In 1994, Rodolfo G. Valencia, then Governor of Oriental Mindoro, invited the Aboitiz Group to ply the route. His intention was to bring a more convenient and faster alternative to Mindoro. Under the management of Universal Aboitiz Inc., M/V SuperCat 1, their pioneer vessel, traveled between Batangas and Calapan in only 45 minutes. SuperCat added routes throughout the Visayas Region. High-speed crafts became popular in the Philippines. In 1997, Sea Angels (owned by Negros Navigation) merged with Universal Aboitiz and Hong Kong Park View Holdings to form the Philippine Fast Ferry Corporation.An assessment of Year One of the Aquino administration (30 June 2011), philippinebusiness.com.ph (archived from the original on 2011-07-22). SuperCat also acquired the 2 vessels of Waterjet Shipping Corporation (owned by Waterjet Netherlands Antilles). They renamed it as SuperCat 17 (former Waterjet 1, currently FastCat Ryde) and Supercat 18 (former Waterjet 2, currently FastCat Shanklin). The merger was eventually dissolved in 2002 and SuperCat became solely owned by Aboitiz. The abolition of the WG&A; merger then soon unraveled. SuperCat sacrificed some of its vessels and their corresponding routes in order to sustain its fast craft operations. SuperCat also downsized from 200 to just 100 employees. From the 1990s to early 2000s, all SuperCat vessels were waterjet-propelled. Due to economic problems, Aboitiz was forced sell ships reducing an original fleet of fourteen down to just seven.SuperCat attacks Philippine ferry standards (May 1, 2005), allbusiness.com (archived from the original on 2008-03-19), To cope with the soaring fuel prices, SuperCat started replacing their previous fleet with more fuel-efficient vessels.

He was a Holocaust perpetrator responsible for atrocities committed by the Einsatzgruppen in German-occupied Poland and the Soviet Union and was convicted after the war of numerous war crimes. SS career Schaper joined the SS and was promoted to the rank of SS-Untersturmf√ºhrer on 20 April 1935. He achieved the rank of SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer on 20 April 1937. Before the 1939 invasion of Poland, Schaper worked at the SD principal offices of Nazi Germany. During the German occupation of Poland Schaper served as commander of Kommando SS Zichenau-Schr√∂ttersburg ‚Äì a Nazi Einsatzgruppe, one of five such formations created in eastern Poland and composed of 500‚Äì1000 functionaries of the SS and Gestapo. Schaper operated in the P≈Çock (renamed Schr√∂ttersburg) district administered by Count von der Groeben. His superior was Sturmbannf√ºhrer Hartmut Pulmer, a Gestapo chief based in Ciechan√≥w (renamed Zichenau).Thomas Urban, \\"Poszukiwany Hermann Schaper\\" (A Wanted Man), Rzeczpospolita, 01.09.01 Nr 204. Interrogation of Hermann Schaper, http://www.polish-jewish- heritage.org/eng/IPN_Interregation_of_Schaper.htm:de:Hartmut Pulmer Schaper's death squad was deployed in the newly formed Bezirk Bialystok district soon after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Himmler himself visited Bia≈Çystok on 30 June 1941 and pronounced that more forces were needed in the area, because the massive chase after the fleeing Red Army left behind a security vacuum. On 3 July additional formation of Schutzpolizei arrived in the city from the General Government, led by SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Wolfgang Birkner, veteran of Einsatzgruppe IV from the Polish Campaign. The relief unit, called kommando Bialystok, was sent in by SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer Eberhard Sch√∂ngarth on orders from the Reich Main Security Office, due to reports of Soviet guerrilla activity in the area with Jews being of course immediately suspected of helping them out. On 10 July 1941 Schaper's Einsatzgruppe was subdivided into dozens of smaller commandos (Einsatzkommandos) numbering from several to several scores of people whose mission was to kill Jews, alleged communists and the Soviet NKVD collaborators in the captured territories often far behind the advancing German front. The entire Einsatzgruppe employed the same, systematic method of mass killing across many Polish villages and towns in the vicinity of Bia≈Çystok. Schaper's murderous rampage south-east of East Prussia included Wizna (end of June), WƒÖsosz (5 July), Radzi≈Ç√≥w (7 July), Jedwabne (10 July), ≈Åom≈ºa (early August), Tykocin (22‚Äì25 August), Rutki (4 September), PiƒÖtnica, Zambr√≥w as well as other locations.  Postwar trials  At the beginning of the 1960s, the war crimes committed by Schaper were investigated by the German Judicial Centre for Prosecuting Nazi Crimes in Ludwigsburg. The prosecutors had called a key witness, the German Kreiskommissar in ≈Åom≈ºa, who named the Gestapo paramilitary Einsatzgruppe B under SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Hermann Schaper in the course of Birkner's investigation. Schaper was charged in 1964 with personally directing the Einsatzkommando responsible for the mass killing of Jews in the city. Two witnesses from Israel ‚Äì Chaja Finkelstein from Radzi≈Ç√≥w and Izchak Feler from Tykocin ‚Äì recognized Hermann Schaper from photographs as the one responsible also for the pogrom in Radzi≈Ç√≥w on 7 July 1941, as well as the mass murders in Tykocin of 25 August 1941. The methods used by Schaper's death squad in these massacres were identical to those employed in Jedwabne (a few kilometers distance) only three days later. Schaper denied the charges, and the Germans found the evidence insufficient to prosecute him at that time. He lied to interrogators that in 1941 he had been a truck driver and used false names. Legal proceedings against him were terminated on 2 September 1965 despite his positive identification by the courts.Thomas Urban, reporter of the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung; Polish text in Rzeczpospolita, 1‚Äì2 September 2001 He was retried in Germany in 1976 for other crimes against Poles and Jews and was sentenced to six years in prison, however following an appeal this was overturned and his health was declared too fragile for a new trial.The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933‚Äì1945, Geoffrey P. Megargee, Martin C. Dean, and Mel Hecker, Volume II, part A, pages 943-944.. Schaper was convicted along with Franz Hartmann, Hans Doermage, Kurt Baresel also from the Gestapo station at Ciechan√≥w for their complicity in holocaust-related crimes.https://www.jta.org/1976/11/23/archive/5-ex-nazis- sentenced-to-prison Another defendant, Ernst Schardt was acquitted. Charges against Otto Roehr were dropped. Schaper died of old age in his nineties.

Career Magpayo is one of only a few people in the industry to have worked in all media: theater, radio, film, and television. Her career in broadcasting started when she was about 18 years old, after she joined radio comedians Andoy Balunbalunan and Dely Atay-Atayan as a group singer. She got her first counselling program on radio station DZRH on October 6, 1953. She eventually transferred to the L√≥pez family-owned DZMM.

This signaled her to resume her broadcasting career. After Martial Law, Magpayo became the first ever anchor of the then reopened DZMM 630, but after a few years, she transferred to DZRH. There, she continued radio shows until she had a total airtime of nearly seven decades, rightfully earning the title \\"First Lady of Philippine Radio.\\" Even as an octogenarian, she maintained a full work schedule at the station, hosting a nightly show Ang Inyong Tiya Dely (\\"Your Aunt Dely\\") apart from her usual weekend program.

He was a member of the House of Representatives from 2001 to 2010, representing the 1st district of Makati and later served as the Philippine Ambassador to the United Nations from 2017 to 2018. He was the host of the editorial segment titled \\"Teditorial\\" for ANC's nightly newscast The World Tonight Early life Locsin was born in Manila on November 15, 1948. His father was the prominent newspaperman and publisher Teodoro Locsin Sr. who was hailed from the Locsin family of Molo, Iloilo's Negros Occidental branch. He studied in the Ateneo de Manila University and received a bachelor's degree in Law and Jurisprudence. Supreme Court nominations When Senior Associate Justice Leonardo Quisumbing retired from the Supreme Court in 2009, Locsin was among the candidates nominated by the Judicial and Bar Council as a potential replacement. However, he was not appointed to the said post. In 2012, he was nominated as chief justice to replace Renato Corona but the post eventually went to then-Associate Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno. United Nations He was designated as the Philippines' Permanent Representative to the United Nations by President Rodrigo Duterte in 2017. It was announced that he accepted the appointment on September 18, 2016. His term officially began when he presented his credentials to Ant√≥nio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, on April 19, 2017. Under his leadership, the Philippines voted to abstain from the challenge against the legality of the Independent Expert on SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) at a November 2016 session. Also, the Philippines was among 10 nations that voted against a UN resolution urging Myanmar to end its military campaign against Rohingya Muslims living in the Rakhine state in November 2017. Additionally, the country was one of only 35 nations to abstain on the UN vote to declare the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital null and void during an emergency December 2017 session of the UN General Assembly. In March 2018, Locsin submitted the country's letter of withdrawal from the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC, after President Duterte expressed his intent to withdraw from the court. Locsin vacated the post of Permanent Representative of the Philippines to the United Nations on October 12, 2018 upon assuming the post of foreign affairs secretary. Foreign Affairs Secretary Locsin (left) with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in February 2019 On October 11, 2018, Locsin announced that president Rodrigo Duterte offered him the post of Secretary of Foreign Affairs, which was held by Alan Peter Cayetano. Cayetano will run in the 2019 elections for representative of Taguig city, effectively vacating the position. He was sworn in by President Duterte as foreign affairs secretary on October 17, 2018, and his appointment confirmed by the Commission on Appointments on November 28, 2018. Personal life Relationships He is married to Ma. Lourdes Barcelon, who ran for Congress at the First District of Makati for the Liberal Party, but lost to outgoing Councilor Monique Yasmin Lagdameo of PDP‚ÄìLaban. She ran for such post as her husband is ineligible to seek reelection after three consecutive terms of service. He was formerly married to Philippine Stock Exchange director Vivian Yuchengco. They have two daughters, Margarita and Bianca. Social media presence Locsin frequently uses social media as a platform to air his views. He is pro-death penalty, citing in Twitter that the President should order the mass murder of cops who hurt others. He has been criticised for his controversial use of social media. He is against the use of Filipino languages such as Tagalog in debates, preferring English.

Filipino language In late March 2016, he was chastised by internet users over his Twitter comments calling the Tagalog language \\"inappropriate to pointed debate\\" during the Visayas leg of PiliPinas Debates 2016. He later defended his comments concerning the use of Tagalog in debates. Philippine Drug War Locsin expressed support for the Philippine Drug War on August 21, 2017, through Twitter, comparing the campaign against drugs of President Rodrigo Duterte to Adolf Hitler's Final Solution and said he does not believe in the rehabilitation of drug addicts. He followed this with another remark that the \\"Nazis were not all wrong\\" and said people should keep an open mind drawing criticism. He cited Hitler's military and economic policies that \\"are paying off even now in German primacy in Europe\\" but conceded that the Holocaust \\"wiped out his economic contribution.\\" Locsin later retracted these remarks by deleting the tweet, however threatened individuals who criticized him. Rape as a heinous crime On February 20, 2017, the majority bloc members of the House of Representatives caucused to remove rape from the list of possible death penalty offenses. When the official Twitter account of the ABS-CBN News Channel reported this, Locsin tweeted a reply: Locsin in a tweet said that while rape is a crime; an \\"indignity\\" and \\"outrage\\" it is not a heinous crime. Though he went on to mention select cases of rape as \\"heinous\\" such as a gang rape in India and an incident where the rapist is an ugly man. He then said that killing is not heinous or premeditated saying its a common crime. His posts were criticized by some users of Twitter. Philippine Rise On February 14, 2018, Locsin tweeted that criticizers of the Chinese names imposed by China on the Philippine Rise, which have been recognized by the International Hydrographic Organization, are 'childish and stupid', sparking a word war on the issue. Criticizers noted that Locsin is the current ambassador to the United Nations and should be one the first to defend the Philippines' sovereignty and sovereign rights. Locsin did not reply afterwards.  Sabah  On July 27, 2020, a tweet by the Embassy of the United States to the Philippines regarding the donation of hygiene kits by Filipino expatriates from Sabah indicated that Sabah belongs to Malaysia. Locsin quoted the tweet and replied that \\"Sabah is not in Malaysia\\". In response, on July 29, the foreign minister of Malaysia, Hishammuddin Hussein, called Locsin's remarks irresponsible and damaging to bilateral ties, and summoned the Philippine ambassador to Malaysia, Charles Jose. In response, on July 30, Locsin also summoned the Malaysian ambassador to the Philippines, Norman Muhamad. The Philippines has a claim to much of eastern Sabah, the entirety of which is considered as Malaysian territory. Support of gasoline as a disinfectant On August 1, 2020, Locsin quoted a tweet by radio and television personality Mo Twister criticizing President Rodrigo Duterte's remarks about using gasoline as a disinfectant for face masks. Locsin asked the radio and television personality \\"...what if he's [Duterte] right? Seriously, bro.\\" He added that he knew of people in small towns who used to kill head lice by dropping them into kerosene.

They were members of the Chicagoland Football League and Northern States Football League from 1974-1978 and now plays in the United Championship Football League (UCFL). They were the first professional or semi- professional team to play American football on the European continent. History Founded by local businessmen Jim Foster and Jim Williams in 1974, The team roots can be traced back to the Des Moines Vikings, a semi-pro football team that operated until 1973. The Newton Nite Hawks were coached by Tom Ross during their first season and consisted of several players from the after-mentioned Vikings and played in the Chicagoland Football League (CFL) . The team earned their first ever franchise victory by defeating the Brighton Park Bengals 48-0. After a slow start, the Nite Hawks went on to win 4 of their last 5 games and earned a spot in the CFL playoffs. They were the first team in CFL history to make the playoffs in their first year of operation. The Nite Hawks finished their inaugural season 5-5-1. The 1975 season was a breakout year for the Nite Hawks. Jim Williams took over the head coaching duties as the team finished 10-2, won the American Division Title and captured the CFL championship with a 17-7 win over the Niles Saints. Statistically, the Nite Hawks led the league many categories, including total offense and total defense. In their third year of existence, the 1976 Nite Hawks made the league playoffs for the third consecutive year under new coach Dick Altemeier. The team finished the season 6-5 after a loss to the Delavan (Wisconsin) Red Devils in the first round of the CFL playoffs. The Newton Nite Hawks made football history in 1977. Through the entrepreneurial efforts of Jim Foster, the Newton Nite Hawks were chosen to play a 5-game football tour in Europe (see below) with the Chicago Lions in early June. Additionally, the Nite Hawks became a member of the Northern States Football League. In their final year in Newton, the team finished 5-5 in 1978 under coach Herb Taylor. After winning all 5 games in Europe, the Nite Hawks posted a 7-3 record in the 1977 NSFL regular season. They played all home games at H. A. Lynn Field after three previous seasons at Holland Patterson Field. European Championship In an effort to establish and promote American football in Europe, the Nite Hawks were the first professional team (pro or semi-pro) at any level to play American football on the European continent, as the team and league rival Chicago Lions played a 5 game tour in 3 countries during June, 1977. Organized by the Intercontinental Football League (unrelated to the Intercontinental Football League, the predecessor of NFL Europe), an organization that was founded by Bill Kapp in 1973 and staged similar tour a year earlier between two college teams - the Texas A&I; Javelinas and the Henderson State Reddies. Games were played in Versailles, France; Lille, France; Landstuhl, Germany; Gratz, Austria; and Vienna, Austria. The games in Lille and Gratz drew 21,000 and 13,000 fans respectively. The Nite Hawks swept the Lions, winning all 5 contests and the first (and only) European Professional Football Cup. The IFL attempted to schedule additional games in Linz, Austria and Bucharest, Romania, but logistics and politics proved too difficult for the contests to take place. Nite Hawks running back Mark Fetter scored the first professional touchdown on European soil, a 6 yard run en route to a victory in Versailles, France. 2019 to present In 2019, two Newton entrepreneurs - Gordon Head and Mark Mackerman II - resurrected the team, after they got the approval from original owner Jim Foster, and started to play in the Midwest Football League. They went 9-1 in regular-season, winning the Southwest Division and the Wester Conference titles, but lost 22-28 to Missouri Ravens in the championship game. For the 2020 season the Nite Hawks joined a merger between the and the Midwest Football Alliance - The United Championship Football League (UCFL). In the inaugural UCFL season they finished with a 5-1 record and clinched the 2nd seed for playoffs, but lost to the Midwest (MO) Titans 30-8 in the Semi- Finals. Home Field The Nite Hawks played their home games in Newton at Holland-Patterson Memorial Field (1974‚Äì1976) and H.A. Lynn Field (1977‚Äì1978). The team often practiced at Industrial Park located in the north end of Newton. The new team plays at the Valley Stadium in West Des Moines, Iowa, after they were unable to reach to an agreement with the Newton Community School District Board of Education for the use of H.A. Lynn Stadium. Uniforms The Nite Hawks wore 3 uniform tops during their 5-year history: *1974-75: Black with gold numerals on front/back and shoulders. The sleeves were trimmed with the words IOWA on one sleeve, and HAWKS on the other. *1976-77: Black with gold numerals on front/back and shoulders. Small hawk logo placed on sleeves. The word IOWA was placed above the front chest numerals. *1978: Black with gold numerals on front/back and shoulders. The word NITE HAWKS was placed above the front chest numerals.

Earth's rotational velocity is not constant over time. Any motion of mass in or on Earth causes a slowdown or speedup of the rotation speed, or a change of rotation axis. Small motions produce changes too small to be measured, but movements of very large mass, like sea currents, tides, or those resulting from earthquakes, can produce discernible changes in the rotation and can change very precise astronomical observations. Global simulations of atmosphere, ocean, and land dynamics are used to create effective angular momentum (EAM) functions that can be used to predict changes in EOP. The collection of earth orientation parameters is fitted to describe the observed rotation irregularities. Technically, they provide the rotational transform from the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) to the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS), or vice versa, as a function of time. Components Universal time Universal time (UT1) tracks the Earth's rotation in time, which performs one revolution in about 24 hours. The Earth's rotation is uneven, so UT is not linear with respect to atomic time. It is practically proportional to the sidereal time, which is also a direct measure of Earth rotation. The excess revolution time is called length of day (LOD). Coordinates of the pole Due to the very slow pole motion of the Earth, the Celestial Ephemeris Pole (CEP, or celestial pole) does not stay still on the surface of the Earth. The Celestial Ephemeris Pole is calculated from observation data, and is averaged, so it differs from the instantaneous rotation axis by quasi-diurnal terms, which are as small as under 0.01\\" (see Seidelmann, P.K. 1982: Celest. Mech., 27, 79.). In setting up a coordinate system, a static terrestrial point called the IERS Reference Pole, or IRP, is used as the origin; the x-axis is in the direction of IRM, the IERS Reference Meridian; the y-axis is in the direction 90 degrees West longitude. x and y are the coordinates of the CEP relative to the IRP. Celestial pole offsets Celestial pole offsets are described in the IAU Precession and Nutation models. The observed differences with respect to the conventional celestial pole position defined by the models are monitored and reported by the IERS.

In the United States, Derek Elley of Variety described it as bleak and violent, but praised it as \\"well drawn in all its diversity (and with occasional humor) by a good cast.\\" James Mudge of Beyond Hollywood gave it a positive review: \\"Although its premise may sound overly familiar, Gangster High certainly stands as one of the best teen violence films of recent years, with Park proving that he has not lost his touch when it comes to dealing with tales of troubled youth. Hard-hitting and gripping, it offers a different and arguably more convincing take on the usual themes, and contains enough vicious action to entertain as well as provoke.\\" The film was distributed in the Netherlands on DVD in 2009 by Splendid Film.

Built in 1320, the church was destroyed by enemy bombing during the blitz in November 1940. In 1957 the shell of the church was dedicated as a memorial to the sailors of the Merchant Navy. It is a Grade II* listed building. __TOC__ History The first documentary evidence of the existence of Holyrood was in 1160 when Henry II granted the Chapels of St. Michael, Holyrood, St. Lawrence and All Saints' to the monks of St. Denys. The name of the church, \\"Holy Rood\\", indicates its Saxon origins; if the church had been founded after the Norman conquest, it would have been named \\"St. Cross\\". The original church was situated in the centre of the High Street, then known as \\"English Street\\", but in 1320, the church was pulled down and rebuilt on its present site on the eastern side of the road. During the Middle Ages, the church was situated at the centre of the town and was the parish church for the south-eastern quarter. As such, it became a focal point for life in the town and was used as a place of worship by crusaders en route to the Holy Land, soldiers heading for Agincourt in 1415 and Philip II of Spain in 1554 on his way to marry Queen Mary at Winchester Cathedral. In his 1801 \\"Walk Through Southampton\\", Sir Henry Englefield describes Holy Rood thus: By 1841, the organ had been moved to the western end of the church. In \\"The Market Towns of Hampshire\\" written in 1841, the church was described thus: > Holy Rhood church, a large and ancient structure, consists of a nave with > side aisles and a choir or chancel; it has a tower and spire at the south- > west angle, and a colonnade or portico, which occupies the whole front. The > church contains several stalls of neat workmanship, a wooden screen of the > time of Elizabeth or James I, a neat Gothic font, and some fragments of fine > painted glass in the windows. In 1848‚Äì49 the vicar, Reverend William Wilson, set about restoring the church, retaining parts of the 14th century chancel and aisles and the south-west tower and spire. At the same time, the wooden Doric colonnade, known locally as the \\"Proclamation\\", which stood immediately outside the church was demolished. Wilson's efforts turned Holyrood from a quiet run down church on the corner of Bernard Street to a very popular church. Writing in 1850, Philip Brannon said: > Holyrood Church, with the exception of the chancel and tower, is newly > rebuilt, or rather restored, in a manner that reflects the highest credit on > the Vicar and committee who promoted, and on the architect, builder, and > carver who executed the work. The effect of the interior is very fine; the > rich tracery of the great west window ‚Äì the lofty pointed arches between the > body and the aisles, with the neat clerestories above them ‚Äì the ancient > chancel ‚Äì and the open timber roof ‚Äì produce a very imposing whole, > judiciously preserved by the position of the organ, which does not here > obtrude a heavy square mass on the sight, blinding other principal features, > but is placed on the right. In the census of 1851, it was recorded that the church had a seating capacity of 974, with 462 attending morning service and 405 in the evening. Over the next 90 years, local residents would flock to hear the services and sermons, and it became the place in which to see the New Year in, with the church also becoming known as the \\"Church of the Sailors\\". Southampton in the second world war During the night of 30 November 1940, the centre of Southampton became the target for German bombers, when 800 high explosive bombs and 9,000 incendiaries were dropped on the town centre. In this attack, and that a week earlier, 214 people were killed and nearly 500 properties were totally destroyed. By the morning, Holyrood was a smoking ruin and St. Mary's church was gutted, although nearby St. Michael's survived unscathed. Southampton lost seven churches during the blitz, as well as the nearby Audit House, the Ordnance Survey offices and many shops, factories and homes. During the blitz, the beautiful 14th/early 15th century brass lectern was rescued from the ruins and is now fully restored in St. Michael's. In 1957, the ruins of the church were restored and dedicated as a memorial to Merchant Navy seafarers and the ruins of the church were scheduled as an ancient monument. By 2004, because of the exposure of internal features to the elements and problems with the structure, the church was in danger of collapsing. As a result, a grant of ¬£670,000 was received from the Heritage Lottery Fund to repair the tower and the chancel, with a new lighting scheme being installed to make the former church a feature of Southampton's night skyline. The Merchant Navy Association contributed a further ¬£5,000 to the repair fund \\"to enable (merchant seamen) to remember their colleagues and careers in an appropriate high quality setting\\". Holyrood today Holyrood Church, Southampton. Following the destruction of the church during the blitz, the only parts of the church still standing are the tower at the south-western corner and the chancel at the eastern end, together with large parts of the north walls. The wooden spire was lost as was the great west window, whilst the central area of the church was completely destroyed. On the west face of the tower there is a memorial plaque to Charles Dibdin (1745‚Äì1814) described as a \\"native of Southampton, poet, dramatist and composer, author of Tom Bowling, Poor Jack and other sea songs\\". Above the plaque are the clock and church bells, which feature pre-1760 Quarter jacks, small figures that strike the quarters of each hour. Inside the church, under the tower is a memorial fountain, erected in 1912‚Äì13 for those who lost their lives in the sinking of the RMS Titanic, which was removed from its original site in Cemetery Road on Southampton Common. The fountain is supported on four stone columns, with a curved pediment on each side with carvings depicting the \\"Titanic\\", surmounted by a four-columned cupola. The memorial is augmented by audioposts installed in 2007, from which can be selected historical recordings made by the Southampton Oral History Unit which \\"give the listener a very real impression of what the now ruined church looked like before the war and what that area meant to those who loved it\\". The whole edifice is dedicated to the men of the Merchant Navy and hosts the annual Merchant Navy Day memorial service; in the corner of the former nave is an anchor behind which is a plaque bearing the legend: > The church of Holyrood erected on this site in 1320 was damaged by enemy > action on 30 Nov 1940. Known for centuries as the church of the sailors the > ruins have been preserved by the people of Southampton as a memorial and > garden of rest, dedicated to those who served in the Merchant Navy and lost > their lives at sea. As part of the improvements in 2004‚Äì06, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, the artist metal worker, Charles Normandale created a series of wrought iron metal screens, gates and railings for the Chancel and Titanic Memorial Fountain. The chancel, now with a glass roof, and nave are used for temporary exhibitions and musical events.

This temple, named Xuanfu Palace, began construction in 1504 and was completed 12 years later, under the Zhengde Emperor. The temple later came to be known as Huilongguan. After its completition, the temple was often used by the Ming emperors as a stopping place between the Forbidden City and the Ming tombs at Tianshou Mountain. This may explain why the temple was also known as Huilongguan (Returning Dragon View). Alternatively, the name could have come from a nearby Taoist temple named Huilong, which would have been visible from Xuanfu Palace.

History Logo of LaserMotive used until the company changed its name in 2017 The predecessor to PowerLight Technologies, LaserMotive, was founded in 2006 by physicists Tom Nugent and Jordin Kare. The company's initial goal was to win the NASA Centennial Challenges Power Beam challenge. After winning the challenge, LaserMotive focused on developing the power beaming technology for commercial application on UAVs and successfully demonstrated the transfer of 400 watts of power over 1 kilometer.http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/stp/centennial_challenges/after_challenge/lasermotive.html In 2017, LaserMotive changed its name to PowerLight Technologies, hired three new advisors, and officially announced the launch of commercial applications for its power-over-fiber technology. The company's new CEO Richard Gustoffson described this new focus on power-over-fiber as a \\"major transformation\\" for the company. PowerLight also continues to work toward commercial application of its technology to free-space power transmission. Technology The power beaming system uses a laser running from a power supply. To define the beam size at its destination, the laser's light can be shaped by a set of optics. This light energy can be sent through air or the vacuum of space, onto a photovoltaic (PV) receiver, where it is converted back into electricity. In addition to delivering energy through air or space, PowerLight adapted the technology to deliver electricity through an optical fiber.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ3Zh85Ki_c By transmitting a focused laser light through optical fiber to a solar cell-like receiver, this technology allows for power to be provided over hundreds of meters in environments where electric transmission by copper wire is not optimal, either due to the higher weight of wire compared to glass fiber, or due to operational constraints imposed by electromagnetic fields generated by electrical transmission by wire. Uses include ground, air, and underwater applications. The electrical-to-optical conversion efficiency of modern laser technology can be as high as 85%,Paul Crump, et al.,SHEDs Funding Enables Power Conversion Efficiency up to 85% at High Powers from 975-nm Broad Area Diode Lasers.

At the 2009 Challenge, on November 6, 2009, LaserMotive successfully used lasers to drive a device up a cable suspended from a helicopter. Energy is transmitted to the climber using a high-power infrared beam. LaserMotive's entry, which was the only one to top the cable, reached an average speed of and earned a $900,000 prize.

Walpers Annales Botanices Systematicae 6(1861)393-394. Berlin. Like other members of this subgenus, E. catillus has thin stems which show no tendency to produce pseudobulbs, covered with tight, tubular sheathes which bear distichous leaves on the upper part of the stem, a long apical peduncle covered from its base with tight tubular sheathes, and a lip which is adnate to the column to its apex. The plant height is variable, from 0.2 m to 1 m. The leathery leaves grow as long as 7.5 cm, and as wide as 3.5 cm. The inflorescence is usually a raceme, although paniculate inflorescences have been observed; the flowers are born close together near the end of the raceme. The flowers are red to violet and white, and open fully. The oblong sepals are grow to 1.5 cm long, the petals are somewhat smaller. As is typical of E. sect. Schistochila, the lip has lateral lobes and a medial lobe, which divides in two in this species. As is typical of E. subsect. Tuberculata, the lip margins are crenulate to lacerate, and the lip bears an irregularly-shaped tubercule; in this species, the large tubercule extends much of the way down the medial lobe and into the lateral lobes, is mostly white, and is accompanied by two small colored calli, one on either side of the column apex.

Early life Lane was born 31 July 1864 in Waialua and was personally named after Kamehameha V. He was a brother of John Carey Lane and of Irish-Hawaiian who claimed to be descended from Kamehameha I and the Irish Monarchy. He expressed this claim openly to fellow insurgents receiving the nickname \\"Kamehameha\\". Family Lane married Elizabeth Lokai Haohele who had their daughter Bernicia Kailiponi Lane (1898‚Äì1942). Military career Lane was a Royal Guard during the Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He joined the insurgency and was a Lieutenant and third-in-command in the 1895 Uprising under Robert W. Wilcox and Samuel Nowlein. Lane was known to be intimidating standing six feet tall. He was a Second-in-command during the Battle of Diamond Head where his brother was captured. During the Battle of MƒÅnoa he was separated from the retreating insurgent force and fled into the Koolau mountains. He came out of hiding after fighting subsided believing a foreign intervention had come, after asking a passerby he discovered the Revolution was crushed. Contrary to the fears of Lt. Lane and the warning to Government Forces to use caution when encountering him, he surrendered peacefully to police becoming the last insurgent to be captured. After being brought to police headquarters he was escorted by six guards for fear that he might overpower the regular number for a normal prisoner. He was locked in with over a hundred undernourished POWs. He protested that night making noise with food trays and yelling to provide additional food.

It was originally raised in 1917 during the First World War but was disbanded the same year without seeing active service. Later it was re-raised as a part of the Militia in 1938 in Brisbane, Queensland. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War they initially undertook garrison duties in Australia, however, in 1942 they were deployed to New Guinea where they took part in the Battle of Milne Bay, during which the Japanese were defeated for the first time in a major land battle. In late 1943, the 61st Battalion was withdrawn back to Australia for a period of re-organisation and training before being deployed overseas again in late 1944. This time they were deployed to Bougainville, where the Australian 3rd Division had taken over from the American garrison and the battalion joined the drive towards the Japanese stronghold at Buin in the south of the island. Following the end of the war, the 61st Battalion was disbanded as part of the demobilisation process on 8 January 1946. History Formation The 61st Battalion was initially raised in the United Kingdom in February 1917 as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during the First World War in an effort to raise the 6th Division. However, following manpower shortages that occurred as a result of heavy losses amongst the AIF on the Western Front in 1917 and the failure of attempts to introduce conscription in Australia, it was decided to disband the division and its subordinate units in September 1917 and use their personnel to reinforce other units.. As a result, the 61st Battalion was disbanded without seeing active service. In 1938, the 61st Battalion was re-raised as part of the Militia in response to growing tensions in Europe. At this time, the battalion was formed in the Brisbane‚ÄìIpswich area with a small detachment based in Toowoomba.. The main driving force behind convincing the government to establish the battalion was Sir Donald Cameron, and from the outset it was intended that the unit should be a Scottish battalionOther Australian Scottish battalions that existed at the time were the 5th Battalion (Victorian Scottish Regiment), the 16th Battalion (Cameron Highlanders of Western Australia), the 27th Battalion (South Australian Scottish Regiment) and the 30th Battalion (New South Wales Scottish Regiment). and approval was gained for its personnel to be equipped with Scottish-style uniforms including kilts and Glengarry caps. The funds for this equipment, however, were not provided for by the government and was a cost that the battalion had to meet itself, which it did so through an appeal for donations from the public.. At this time many of the battalion's initial personnel were men of Scottish birth or ancestry, although later intakes of personnel included men of diverse heritage. In 1939, the battalion was officially bestowed with the title of the \\"Queensland Cameron Highlanders\\", when an alliance with the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders was approved by King George VI.. alt=A middle aged man wearing military style dress and a Glengarry cap Training was undertaken on a voluntary and unpaid basis with weekly parades being undertaken at Kelvin Grove, while field training took place at Fraser's Paddock in Enoggera and Redbank.. By July 1939, the battalion's strength was 550 officers and other ranks.. Second World War =Home duties= At the outset of the Second World War, due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory,. the decision was made to raise an all volunteer force, the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), to serve overseas‚Äîinitial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England‚Äîwhile it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland from possible attack and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training.. Although ultimately the number of men that joined the units of the 2nd AIF from the Militia was in fact lower than anticipated, a large number of such personnel left to seek an opportunity to serve overseas. In this time the 61st Battalion lost many of its experienced senior officers and non-commissioned officers to the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions that were raised in Queensland, as well as to the Royal Australian Air Force.. Of note was the loss of the battalion's pipe and drum band, which joined the 2/25th en masse. A 61st Battalion officer, Major Charles Withy, also went across with them serving initially as the second in command and then later as the 2/25th's commanding officer.. alt=Soldiers standing with rifles on parade Nevertheless, despite this loss of personnel the battalion undertook a number of periods of continuous training throughout 1940‚Äì42 as the Militia were called up progressively for various periods of extended training consisting of between 70 and 90 days.. During this time they joined the rest of the 7th Brigade, to which they were assigned, at Chermside, Queensland. While there, the battalion replaced its Scottish equipment with regular service gear. In September 1941, as the strategic situation in the Pacific worsened, the battalion was \\"called up\\" to provide full-time service for the duration of the war. As a result of this, the battalion was brought up to its full strength of 910 personnel of all ranks. In December, after the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor and Malaya, they undertook defensive duties around Caloundra before moving to Townsville in May 1942 to defend against a possible invasion.. =Milne Bay, 1942‚Äì43= In early 1942, the situation in the Pacific grew worse as the garrison at Singapore fell and the Japanese began to advance south towards Australia. In March, they landed Lae and Salamaua on the north coast of New Guinea, and then later in July they landed at Buna and Gona in Papua.. By this time the Australian government decided to bring the units of the 2nd AIF back from the Middle East to defend against a possible Japanese invasion of Australia and although this process had begun, the only troops available to respond immediately to the Japanese landings were units from the Militia. Troops from the 30th Brigade had already been deployed around Port Moresby, however, over the course of a month in July and August the 61st Battalion, along with the rest of the 7th Brigade, was moved to Milne Bay,. situated on the eastern tip of New Guinea, where the 61st took up defensive duties around the airstrip at Gili Gili alongside the 25th Battalion. alt=A black and white photograph of Australian soldiers patrolling along a muddy track surrounded by thick jungle. The men are armed with rifles which are held at the high port position and are wearing tropical uniforms consisting of shorts and lightweight short sleeve shirts. One of the soldiers is patrolling without a shirt. On the night of 25/26 August 1942 about 2,000 Japanese marines with tank support carried out an amphibious landing north of Milne Bay.. As the Japanese advanced towards the 7th Brigade's main defensive position from their beachhead around Waga Waga, the 61st Battalion bore the brunt of the initial assault and temporarily halted the Japanese advance with an ambush before launching a counterattack against them... The following morning, however, after the 2/10th Battalion had come under attack from Japanese armour, the 61st Battalion was also forced back towards the No. 3 airstrip, where they formed a defensive line against the main Japanese thrust which came on 31 August. With strong artillery support, the 61st and 25th Battalions managed to turn back the Japanese attack, inflicting heavy casualties and in the process seizing the initiative. Following this, elements of the 18th Brigade advanced towards the Japanese beachhead, which they subsequently captured on 6 September, inflicting upon the Japanese their first defeat in a major battle on land during the war. During its involvement in the battle, the 61st Battalion suffered 19 killed and 27 wounded.. They remained at Milne Bay until March 1943, however, when they were withdrawn to Donadabu, near Port Moresby where the battalion undertook training exercises and carried out patrols around the villages that were scattered around the start of the Kokoda Track. As the battalion was brought back up to full establishment, they were warned out for combat on a number of occasions, however, eventually it was decided to withdraw the 7th Brigade back to Australia in November 1943.. For his leadership of the battalion during this time, the 61st Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Meldrum, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Captain Charles Bicks, who had commanded 'B' Company during the fighting around Milne Bay,. also received a DSO. =New Guinea and Bougainville, 1944‚Äì45= After a period of leave, the battalion began to reform on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland during February 1944 and for the next eight months they undertook a number of exercises and training periods as they prepared for the next stage of the war.. During this time, the battalion's authorised strength was reduced to 803 men of all ranks, as the 3rd Division was converted to the Jungle divisional establishment. On 20 July 1944, the 61st Battalion embarked upon HMAT Katoomba in Cairns and proceeded overseas again. They arrived at Madang in New Guinea four days later. As it was considered that there were still isolated pockets of Japanese in the area, the battalion began patrolling operations almost as soon as they had landed.. They remained at Madang, undertaking garrison duties, until November 1944 when the 61st Battalion was transferred to Torokina on Bougainville Island as Australian troops took over responsibility of the island from the American garrison.. Initial Allied intelligence estimates placed the size of the Japanese forces on Bougainville at around 18,000 men, however, it was later determined that the number was closer to 40,000.. Nevertheless, it was decided that the Australians would go on the offensive and would pursue a three pronged advance across the island, with the main effort being an advance in the southern sector along the narrow coastal plain towards the Japanese stronghold at Buin.. Initially, the 7th Brigade, to which the battalion was attached, was employed in the northern sector holding positions along the Numa Numa trail, however, in January 1945 they took over from the 29th Brigade which had been operating in the southern sector and from then until March, the 61st Battalion took part in the advance inland from the Jaba River through Mosina, Sisirua, and Mosigetta towards the Puriata River. Men from the 61st Battalion patrol along the Mosigetta River on Bougainville in March 1945 Advancing in bounds, occupying company bases and sending out patrols, the battalion began its move south on 15 January 1945.. Throughout the rest of the month, the battalion was involved in a number of relatively minor engagements with the Japanese as they carried out patrolling and ambush operations along the Australian line of advance. By the start of February they reached Mosina and after receiving intelligence that a Japanese force had been detected at Warapa, they sent out to raid their camp. Upon reaching Warapa the patrol set fire to the huts in which the Japanese force was billeted and then withdrew. Later reconnaissance determined that 15 Japanese had died in the blaze.. By 12 February the battalion married up with patrols from the 25th Battalion that were moving along the Tavera River and then later, as the battalion continued on towards Mosigetta, one company linked up with patrols from the 9th Battalion on 17 February.. In late February, the Japanese forces around Mosigetta withdrew after pressure from Captain Ted Hutchinson's company in an action for which he was later awarded the Military Cross. The 61st Battalion, after establishing its headquarters at Mosigetta, continued its advance alongside the 25th Battalion.. After the 25th Battalion crossed the Puriata, a patrol from the 61st strove for the Hari where they clashed with a group of between 15 and 20 Japanese holding an entrenched position. Upon establishing contact, the patrol's artillery forward observation officer called down indirect fire from the supporting artillery battery and as the patrol assaulted the position, the Japanese defenders withdrew, leaving six of their dead behind. The position was subsequently revealed to consist of four main pits and 20 other smaller ones.. After this engagement the battalion was withdrawn from the line for a brief period due to concerns about its morale while the rest of the 7th Brigade continued the advance along the Buin road throughout February and into March.. alt=A location map, depicting a portion of the western coast of Bougainville, showing the relative position of Slater's Knoll, the Buin Road and several other key locations Throughout March Japanese resistance steadily increased and during this time a number of attacks were made on the Australian rear areas and line of communications. As a result, the 61st Battalion was re-committed to the advance, with a company being allocated to defend the 25th Battalion's rear echelon along the Buin Road near a feature named \\"Slater's Knoll\\".. As the Japanese launched a counteroffensive designed to check the Australian advance, the 61st Battalion's main engagement came between 29 March and 5 April when they took part in the Battle of Slater's Knoll. On 30 March the battalion's 'A' Company was attacked six times by a Japanese force of about 300 men.. This attack was repulsed for the loss of two Australians killed and two wounded.. At dawn the following morning, 'A' Company attempted to clear the Japanese from the track that led back to Slater's Knoll, however, coming up against an entrenched force of about 70 Japanese, they were forced to abandon the attempt after exchanging fire for 45 minutes.. Over the course of the next week, the Japanese launched a number of attacks on the Australians around Slater's Knoll, during which time they suffered an estimated 620 men killed and over 1,000 wounded.. The main Japanese attacks, however, were concentrated on the 25th Battalion and for the majority of the battle the 61st took part in defensive operations on the periphery of the 25th's position to protect their rear and to provide close infantry support to the Matilda tanks of the 2/4th Armoured Regiment.. During this time, the 61st Battalion was involved in a number of \\"minor contacts\\".. The incidents of disease and casualties, coupled with combat fatigue and poor leadership resulted in a poor state of morale in the battalion in this period. On 9 April, the 7th Brigade commander, Brigadier John Field, relieved the 61st Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Walter Dexter, who had been suffering from arthritis, of his command.. Major William Fry, formerly of the 9th Battalion, was given the task of temporarily commanding the battalion until Lieutenant Colonel Terrence Farrell could take over the following month. As problems with men refusing to go on patrol and lax performance of duty continued throughout early April, the 61st Battalion remained in the role of rear area security for the remainder of the 7th Brigade's involvement in the sector.. On 15 April, following the conclusion of the fighting around Slater's Knoll, the 7th Brigade was relieved by the 29th and they returned to Torokina where they remained until the end of the war. Over the course of the campaign, the 61st Battalion lost 48 men killed or wounded.. Disbandment Following the end of hostilities the 61st Battalion took part in the surrender ceremony that took place at Torokina. Later, as they were waiting for repatriation back to Australia, the battalion was employed guarding Japanese prisoners of war. In November orders arrived for the battalion to return to Australia and after embarking on the Westralia, they landed at Cairns on 19 November 1945, and moved back to Brisbane by train.. As the battalion's strength dwindled as a result of the demobilisation process and men returned to civilian life, the decision was made to disband the unit. This occurred on 8 January 1946 at Victoria Barracks, Brisbane.. Casualties throughout the war consisted of 48 killed or died on active service and a further 56 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: two Distinguished Service Orders, three Military Crosses, eight Military Medals and 17 Mentions in Despatches. Alliances The 61st Battalion held the following alliances:. * United Kingdom ‚Äì Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders. Battle honours For their service during the Second World War, the 61st Battalion received five battle honours: * South-West Pacific 1942‚Äì1945, Milne Bay, Liberation of Australian New Guinea, Mosigetta and Puriata River..

Meadow was born in northeastern New Mexico. She lost both of her back hooves to frostbite and was found badly wounded on a neighbor's property by Nancy Dickenson, who has helped over a dozen other animals that have been injured. After seeing the serious injuries of the wounded calf, Dickenson wanted to give her the ability to walk again. After consulting with veterinarians to ensure Meadow could lead a quality life, the doctors amputated a portion of the calf's hind legs and fitted her with new prosthetics. Colorado State veterinarian Dr. Robert Callan stated that he believes this to be the first bovine calf to be fitted with double prosthetics. He has based this claim with talks he has had with other veterinarian clinics and schools. Procedure The procedure took place at the Colorado State University's (CSU) Veterinary Teaching Hospital. The procedure involved five anesthesiologists, expert large animal veterinarians, surgeons, and CSU veterinary students. The reason for the large number of anesthesiologists was due to the number of difficulties involved in anesthetizing cattle. The most difficult of these is keeping the animal from aspirating its stomach contents while put asleep during surgery. When a person undergoes surgery, they first go a period of time without eating or drinking before an elective surgery. This allows the patient's stomach to empty and decreases the opportunity of aspirating stomach content while placed under an anesthetizing agent. These precautions can not be undertaken when dealing with livestock. The calf's stomach has compartments that work \\"like a giant fermenting vat\\". This means that the stomach can never be emptied. Because of this, the food material within the stomach is frequently regurgitated back into the mouth. Coupled with a large amount of saliva, this placed the calf at a high risk of aspiration of this material. This in return could lead to an airway obstruction and later pneumonia. Recovery left Meadow has since returned from the successful operation and prosthetic fittings. Dickenson has said she is adjusting well to her new legs as she recuperates at her new home at Twin Willows Ranch. She can be seen running and grazing, and is said to be \\"making friends with goats in a nearby pen.\\" References Category:Individual cattle Category:Prosthetics Category:Individual animals in the United States ","title":"Meadow (calf)"},{"id":"24995467","text":"Frederic Whiting (1874 - 1 August 1962), was an English painter who had studied at the Acad√©mie Julian and taught at Heatherley School of Fine Art with Iain Macnab and Bernard Adams.

He was also known by the nicknames la belva (\\"the beast\\") and il capo dei capi (Sicilian: 'u capu di 'i capi, \\"the boss of bosses\\"). Riina succeeded Luciano Leggio as head of the Corleonesi criminal organisation in the mid 1970s and achieved dominance through a campaign of violence, which caused police to target his rivals. Riina had been a fugitive since the late 1960s after he was indicted on a murder charge. He was less vulnerable to law enforcement's reaction to his methods, as the policing removed many of the established chiefs who had traditionally sought influence through bribery. In violation of established Mafia codes, Riina advocated the killing of women and children, and killed blameless members of the public solely to distract law enforcement agencies. Hit man Giovanni Brusca estimated he murdered between 100 and 200 people on behalf of Riina. Although this scorched-earth policy neutralized any internal threat to Riina's position, he increasingly showed a lack of his earlier guile by bringing his organisation into open confrontation with the state. As part of the Maxi Trial of 1986, Riina was sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia for Mafia association and multiple murder. After 23 years living as a fugitive, he was captured in 1993, provoking a series of indiscriminate bombings of art galleries and churches by his organisation. His lack of repentance subjected him to the stringent Article 41-bis prison regime until his death on 17 November 2017. Early life and career Riina was born on 16 November 1930, and raised in a poverty-stricken countryside house in Corleone, in the then- province of Palermo. In September 1943, his father Giovanni found an unexploded bomb; his father attempted to open it to sell the powder and metal, but in doing so, set it off, killing himself and Riina's seven-year-old brother Francesco, while injuring his other brother Gaetano.Enrico Deaglio, Raccolto rosso: la mafia, l'Italia e poi venne gi√π tutto, Feltrinelli, 1993, p. 158. At the age of 19, Riina was sentenced to a 12-year prison sentence for having killed Domenico Di Matteo in a fight; he was released in 1956. The head of the Mafia family in Corleone was Michele Navarra until 1958, when he was shot dead on the orders of Luciano Leggio, a ruthless 33-year-old Mafioso, who subsequently became the new boss. Together with Riina, Calogero Bagarella and Bernardo Provenzano (who were three of the gunmen in Navarra's slaying), Leggio began to increase the power of the Corleonesi.Profile: Bernardo Provenzano , BBC News, 11 April 2006. In the early 1960s, Leggio, Riina and Provenzano, who had spent the previous few years hunting down and killing dozens of Navarra's surviving supporters, were forced to go into hiding due to arrest warrants. Riina and Leggio were arrested and tried in 1969 for murders carried out earlier that decade. They were acquitted because of intimidation of the jurors and witnesses. Riina went into hiding later that year after he was indicted on a further murder charge and was to remain a fugitive for the next 23 years. In 1974, Leggio was captured and imprisoned for the 1958 murder of Navarra. Although Leggio retained some influence from behind bars, Riina was now the effective head of the Corleonesi. He also had close relations with the 'Ndrangheta, the Mafia-type association in Calabria. His \\"compare d‚Äôanello\\" (a kind of best man and trusted friend, typical of the Southern Italian tradition) at his wedding in 1974 was Domenico Tripodo, a powerful 'Ndrangheta boss and prolific cigarette smuggler. E ora la ‚Äôndrangheta supera cosa nostra: Intervista a Enzo Ciconte , Polizia e democrazia, November‚ÄìDecember 2007 The Corleonesi's primary rivals were Stefano Bontade, Salvatore Inzerillo and Tano Badalamenti, bosses of various powerful Palermo Mafia families. Between 1981 and 1983, the Second Mafia War was instigated by Riina, and Bontade and Inzerillo, together with many associates and members of both their Mafia and blood families, were killed. There were up to a thousand killings during this period as Riina and the Corleonesi, together with their allies, wiped out their rivals. By the end of the war, the Corleonesi were effectively ruling the Mafia, and over the next few years Riina increased his influence by eliminating the Corleonesi's allies, such as Filippo Marchese, Giuseppe Greco and Rosario Riccobono. In February 1980, Tommaso Buscetta had fled to Brazil to escape the brewing Second Mafia War. Mafia leadership Allegations of political influence Prior to Riina's faction becoming the dominant force on the island, the Sicilian Mafia were based in Palermo, where they controlled large numbers of votes, enabling mutually beneficial relationships with local political figures such as mayors of Palermo Vito Ciancimino and Salvatore Lima. Ciancimino, who was born in Corleone, corruptly allowed untrammelled property development on the well-known valley known as \\"Conca d'Oro\\" (Golden Bowl), amassing a vast fortune in the process. Lima granted a valuable monopoly concession on tax collection to Mafia businessman Ignazio Salvo, and was instrumental in Rome-based Giulio Andreotti becoming a force in national politics. In his turn, Salvo acted as financier to Andreotti.Follain, J., Vendetta, 2012 These connections caused some to suspect that Riina had forged similar links with Andreotti, although the courts acquitted Andreotti of associations with the Mafia after 1980.'Kiss of honour' between Andreotti and Mafia head never happened , The Independent, 26 July 2003 Baldassare Di Maggio alleged that Riina met with the then Prime Minister Andreotti at Salvo's home and greeted him with a \\"kiss of honour\\"Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 392Andreotti and Mafia: A Kiss Related , The New York Times, 21 April 1993 Le dichiarazioni di Baldassare Di Maggio, in Sentenza Andreotti Andreotti dismissed the charges against him as \\"lies and slander ‚Ä¶ the kiss of Riina, mafia summits ‚Ä¶ scenes out of a comic horror film\\". Veteran journalist Indro Montanelli doubted the claim, saying Andreotti \\"doesn't even kiss his own children\\"., Time, 3 June 1996 Di Maggio's credibility had been shaken in the closing weeks of the Andreotti trial, when he admitted killing a man while under state protection.

A law to create a new offence of Mafia association and confiscate Mafia assets was introduced by Pio La Torre, secretary of the Italian Communist Party in Sicily, but it had been stalled in parliament for two years. La Torre was murdered on 30 April 1982. In May 1982, the Italian government sent Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, a general of the Italian Carabinieri, to Sicily with orders to crush the Mafia. However, not long after arriving, on 3 September 1982, he was gunned down in the city centre with his wife, Emanuela Setti Carraro, and his driver bodyguard, Domenico Russo. In response to public disquiet about the failure to effectively combat the organisation Riina headed, La Torre's law was passed ten days later.Inside The Mafia , National Geographic Channel, June 2005. On 11 September 1982, Buscetta's two sons from his first wife, Benedetto and Antonio, disappeared, never to be found again, which prompted his collaboration with Italian authorities. This was followed by the deaths of his brother Vincenzo, son-in-law Giuseppe Genova, brother-in-law Pietro and four of his nephews, Domenico and Benedetto Buscetta, and Orazio and Antonio D'Amico. Buscetta was arrested in Sao Paulo, Brazil once again on 23 October 1983, and extradited to Italy on 28 June 1984. Buscetta asked to talk to the anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, and began his life as an informant, referred to as a pentito. =Christmas Massacre= Buscetta was the first high-profile Sicilian Mafiosi to become an informant; he revealed that the Mafia was a single organisation led by a Commission, or Cupola (Dome), thereby establishing that the top tier of Mafia members were complicit in all the organisation's crimes.Follain, p.19-21 Buscetta helped judges Falcone and Paolo Borsellino achieve significant success in the fight against organized crime that led to 475 Mafia members indicted, and 338 convicted in the Maxi Trial. In an attempt to divert investigative resources away from Buscetta's key revelations, Riina ordered a terrorist-style atrocity, 23 December 1984 Train 904 bombing; 17 people were killed and 267 wounded. It became known as the \\"Christmas Massacre\\" (Strage di Natale) and was initially attributed to political extremists. It was only several years later, when police stumbled on explosives of the same type as used in Train 904 while searching the hideout of Giuseppe Cal√≤, that it became apparent that the Mafia had been behind the attack. Rapido 904: \\"Un intreccio tra mafia, camorra e politica\\" , Il Fatto Quotidiano, 27 April 2011 =Assassination of Falcone and Borsellino= As part of the Maxi Trial, Riina was given two life sentences in absentia. Riina pinned his hopes on the lengthy appeal process that had frequently set convicted mafiosi free, and he suspended the campaign of murders against officials while the cases went to higher courts. When the convictions were upheld by the Supreme Court of Cassation in January 1992,Giovanni Falcone, Paolo Borsellino and the Procura of Palermo , Peter Schneider & Jane Schneider, May 2002, essay is based on excerpts from Chapter Six of Jane Schneider and Peter Schneider, Reversible Destiny: Mafia, Antimafia and the Struggle for Palermo, Berkeley: U. of California Press the council of top bosses headed by Riina reacted by ordering the assassination of Salvatore Lima (on the grounds that he was an ally of Giulio Andreotti), and Giovanni Falcone. The aftermath of the bomb attack that killed Giovanni Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards On 23 May 1992, Falcone, his wife Francesca Morvillo and three police officers died in the Capaci bombing on highway A29 outside Palermo. Two months later, Borsellino was killed along with five police officers in the entrance to his mother's apartment block by a car bomb in via D'Amelio.Interview of agent Vullo the day after the massacre. Both attacks were ordered by Riina. Ignazio Salvo, who had advised Riina against killing Falcone, was himself murdered on 17 September 1992. The public was outraged, both at the Mafia and also the politicians who they felt had failed adequately to protect Falcone and Borsellino. The Italian government arranged for a massive crackdown against the Mafia in response. Claims of negotiations with the government Giovanni Brusca later claimed that Riina had told him that after the assassination of Falcone, Riina had been in negotiations with the government. Former interior minister Nicola Mancino said this was not true.Folain, Vendetta, p. 150 In July 2012, Mancino was ordered to stand trial on charges of withholding evidence about alleged 1992 talks between the Italian state and the Mafia.Italy: Ex-interior minister implicated in mafia negotiations , AND Kronos International, 25 July 2012 Some prosecutors have theorized that Borsellino's murder was connected to the alleged negotiations.Follain, Vendetta, p. 187 In 1992, Carabinieri Colonel Mario Mori met with Vito Ciancimino, who was close to Riina's lieutenant Bernardo Provenzano. Mori was later investigated on suspicion of posing a danger to the state after it was alleged he had taken a list of Riina's demands that Ciancimino had passed on. Mori maintained his contacts with Ciancimino were aimed at combating the Mafia and catching Riina, and there had been no list. Mori also said Ciancimino had disclosed little beyond implicitly admitting he knew Mafia members, and that key meetings were after Borsellino's death.Follain, Vendetta, p. 44 & pp. 187‚Äì8 Capture Riina reprimanded Balduccio Di Maggio, an ambitious Mafioso who had left his wife and children for a mistress, telling him he would never be made a full boss. Knowing Riina would order the death of subordinates whom he considered unreliable, Di Maggio fled Sicily and collaborated with the authorities. At the entrance to a complex of villas where a wealthy businessman who acted as Riina's driver lived, Di Maggio identified Riina's wife. On 15 January 1993, Carabinieri arrested Riina at his villa in Palermo. He had been a fugitive for 23 years.Italy Arrests Sicilian Mafia's Top Leader , The New York Times, 16 January 1993Brother of top Mafia turncoat shot , BBC News, 21 March 1998Follain pp. 212‚Äì213 Terror attacks After Riina was captured in January 1993, numerous terror attacks were ordered as warning to its members to not turn state's witness, but also in response for the overruling of the Article 41-bis prison regime.The Olive Tree of Peace: The massacre in via dei Georgofili , The Florentine, 24 May 2012) On 14 May 1993, television host Maurizio Costanzo, who had expressed delight at the arrest of Riina, was almost killed by a bomb as he drove down a Rome street; 23 people were injured. The explosion was part of a series. Less than a fortnight later, on 27 May, a bomb under the Florence Torre dei Pulci killed five people: Fabrizio Nencini and his wife Angelamaria; their daughters, nine-year-old Nadia and two-month-old Caterina; and Dario Capolicchio, aged 20. Thirty-three people were injured. Attacks on art galleries and churches left ten dead and many injured, causing outrage among Italians. Some investigators believed that most of those who carried out murders for Cosa Nostra answered solely to Leoluca Bagarella, and that consequently Bagarella actually wielded more power than Bernardo Provenzano, who was Riina's formal successor. Provenzano reportedly protested about the terroristic attacks, but Bagarella responded sarcastically, telling Provenzano to wear a sign saying \\"I don't have anything to do with the massacres\\".Follain, (2012), Vendetta, pp. 230‚Äì231 Further controversies Riina behind bars in court after his arrest in 1993 Giovanni Brusca‚Äîone of Riina's hitmen who personally detonated the bomb that killed Falcone, and later became an informant after his 1996 arrest ‚Äì has offered a controversial version of the capture of Tot√≤ Riina: a secret deal between Carabinieri officers, secret agents and Cosa Nostra bosses tired of the dictatorship of the Corleonesi. According to Brusca, Bernardo Provenzano \\"sold\\" Riina in exchange for the valuable archive of compromising material that Riina held in his apartment in Via Bernini 52 in Palermo.Schneider & Schneider, Reversible Destiny, p. 156Lodato, Ho ucciso Giovanni Falcone, pp. 135‚Äì37 The Carabinieri's ROS (Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale) persuaded the Palermo Public Prosecutor's Office not to immediately search the Riina's apartment, and then abandoned surveillance of the apartment after six hours leaving it unprotected. The apartment was only raided 18 days later but it had been completely emptied. According to the Carabinieri commanders the house was abandoned because they didn't consider it to be important and they actually never told the prosecutor to be willing to maintain the surveillance during the following days. This version of Riina's arrest has been denied by Carabinieri commander, general (at the time deputy head of the ROS). Mori, however, confirmed that channels of communication were opened with Cosa Nostra through Vito Ciancimino ‚Äì a former mayor of Palermo convicted for Mafia association ‚Äì who was close to the Corleonesi. To sound out the willingness of Mafiosi to talk, Ciancimino contacted Riina's private doctor, . When Ciancimino was informed that the goal was to arrest Riina, he seemed unwilling to continue. At this point, the arrest and cooperation of Balduccio Di Maggio led to the arrest of Riina. In 2006, the Palermo Court absolved Mario Mori and Captain \\"Ultimo\\" () ‚Äì the man who arrested Riina ‚Äì of the charge of consciously aiding and abetting the Mafia. According to an FBI memo revealed in 2007, leaders of the Five Families voted in late 1986 on whether to issue a contract for the death of then U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Rudy Giuliani. Heads of the Lucchese, Bonanno, and Genovese families rejected the idea, though Colombo and Gambino leaders, Carmine Persico and John Gotti, encouraged assassination. In 2014, it was revealed by former Sicilian Mafia member and informant, Rosario Naimo, that Riina had ordered a murder contract on Giuliani during the mid-1980s. Riina allegedly was suspicious of Giuliani's efforts prosecuting the American Mafia and was worried that he might have spoken with Italian anti-mafia prosecutors and politicians, including Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, who were both murdered in 1992 in separate car bombings. According to Giuliani, the Sicilian Mafia offered $800,000 for his death during his first year as mayor of New York in 1994. In November 2009, ‚Äì the son of Vito Ciancimino ‚Äì said that Provenzano betrayed the whereabouts of Riina. Police sent maps of Palermo to Vito Ciancimino. One of these was delivered to Provenzano, then a mafia fugitive. Ciancimino said the map was returned by Provenzano, who indicated the precise location of Riina's hiding place.Boss Riina 'betrayed' by Provenzano , ANSA, 5 November 2009Italy: Top Mafia fugitive 'betrayed' by boss , Adnkronos International, 5 November 2009 Prison Riina was held in a maximum-security prison in Parma with limited contact with the outside world in order to prevent him from running his organization from behind bars. Over US$125,000,000 in assets were confiscated from Riina, and his vast mansion was also acquired by the crusading anti-Mafia mayor of Corleone in 1997. The mansion was subsequently converted into a police office and opened in 2015. In total, Riina was given 26 life sentences and served his sentence in solitary confinement. In mid-March 2003, he underwent surgery for heart problems and in May of the same year he was admitted to a hospital in Ascoli Piceno due to a heart attack. Later that September, he was again hospitalized for heart problems. In 2006, he was transferred to the Opera prison in Milan and, again due to heart problems, was admitted to the San Paolo hospital in Milan. On 4 March 2014, he was hospitalized again. On 31 August 2014, newspapers reported that in November of the previous year, Riina was also threatening against Luigi Ciotti.

Life Fowler was from a Birmingham working-class background and went to King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys there. After completing his studies at Christ Church, Oxford, Fowler was first appointed Lecturer in Classics at Magdalen College (1976‚Äì77), subsequently Dyson Junior Research Fellow in Greek Culture at Balliol College (1978‚Äì80), then, at the early age of 28 years, Fellow and Tutor in Classics at Jesus College, holding simultaneously a University Lecturership in Greek and Latin Literature at Oxford University (1981‚Äì99). Endowed with an outgoing temperament, Fowler was connected to numerous classicists in North America and Europe. His command of Italian enabled him to give even extemporized talks in that language. Thus, he became an important middleman between Italian Latinists and British classicists in the eighties. He kept close ties in particular with Gian Biagio Conte and Alessandro Barchiesi and the Italian peridiocal Materiali e discussioni per l'analisi dei testi classici. Fowler also was on the editorial boards of further periodicals (amongst others Journal of Roman Studies and Arachnion). Fowler married classicist Peta Fowler (n√©e Moon) in 1977 and they had a daughter, Sophia. He died in Oxford on 15 October 1999. Work Although he did not leave a monograph at the time of his premature death, Fowler is to be reckoned amongst the outstanding Latinists of his generation on account of his intellectual range and originality. He was one of the pioneers in the application of modern literary theory and information technology within classical studies. His special research area in Latin literature was Roman Epicureanism and the works of Lucretius and Virgil, subjects to which he made numerous contributions, as he did to others. A book on Lucretius did not appear, however, nor did the long-awaited book with the provisional title Unrolling the Text: books and readers in classical Latin poetry, which was to cover the history of the book roll in antiquity and its function in ancient poetry. Nevertheless, a commentary on part of Book II of Lucretius has been published posthumously by his wife Peta. Moreover, Fowler wrote Subject Reviews in Latin Literature for the periodical Greece and Rome from 1986 to 1993 and was, together with his wife Peta, area editor for Latin literature in the third edition of the Oxford Classical Dictionary (see in particular his contributions on Lucretius, Virgil and Literary Theory and the Classics). As for literary theory, he worked in particular on irony, closure and intertextuality. Selected publications Commentary * Lucretius on atomic motion.

He is credited with creating the field of transportation economics and was one of the pioneers of cliometrics.Edward L. Glaeser, \\"Remembering the Father of Transportation Economics\\", The New York Times (Economix), October 27, 2009.  Life  Born in Pasco, Washington, Meyer attended Pacific University 1945‚Äì1946, after which he served in the United States Naval Reserve 1945‚Äì1948. He received his B.A. from the University of Washington in 1950 and his Ph.D (David A. Wells Prize) from Harvard University in 1955.Reflections on the Cliometrics Revolution: Conversations with Economic Historians His dissertation topic‚Äîbusiness investment decisions‚Äîcoincided with that of a Harvard classmate, Edwin Kuh, leading them to merge both papers and publish it as The Investment Decision: An Empirical Study in 1957. He was a Junior Fellow from 1953‚Äì1955. He married Lee Stowell (1928‚Äì2003) December 17, 1949 and they had three children, Leslie Karen, Ann Elizabeth and Robert Conrad. Meyer was a professor at Harvard University's Department of Economics from 1955 to 1968, at Yale's Department of Economics from 1968 to 1973, and at the Harvard Business School from 1973 to 1983. He served and as the president of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) from 1967 to 1977, before the NBER was moved to Cambridge, MA. Meyer was a consultant to the National Transportation Policy Study Commission from 1977 to 1979. He served as vice chairman and board member of Union Pacific Railroad. He died on October 20, 2009 after a long period of battling with Parkinson's disease.\\"John R. Meyer death notice\\", The Boston Globe, October 22, 2009. At the time of his death he was the James W. Harpel Professor of Capital Formation Emeritus at Harvard Kennedy School.  Research  Meyer was open to interdisciplinary collaboration in his research. He combined engineering with economics. In order to understand the cost structure in the transportation industry he had to work together with engineers. After years of services in such endeavors, Meyer received the Roy W. Crum Distinguished Service Award in 2002.http://www.trb.org/AboutTRB/CrumAward.aspx  Transportation economics  Meyer and three co-authors (Merton Peck, John Stenason and Charles Zwick) published The Economics of Competition in the Transportation Industries in 1959. This book conducted a thorough analysis of costs and demand which enabled the authors to study what the railroad industry might look like if it were better governed. Regulation of railroads had implicitly given incentivizes to passenger over freight trains. This made railroads less efficient and also less profitable because intercity rail‚Äôs great comparative advantage was in moving goods over long distances. Meyer's second great influential book on transportation economics was The Urban Transportation Problem, co-authored with John Kain and Martin Wohl (an engineer). That book described the process of American suburbanization and the rapid switch from public transportation to cars.  Cliometrics  Meyer was a pioneer of New Economic History, also called Cliometrics. In 1958 and fellow Harvard professor Alfred H. Conrad published ‚ÄúThe Economics of Slavery in the Antebellum South‚Äù in the Journal of Political Economy. Using rigorous statistics, the authors concluded that the view that slavery in the United States would have disappeared without the American Civil War, as purported by Charles W. Ramsdell, Ulrich Bonnell Phillips, and other historians, was ‚Äúa romantic hypothesis which will not stand against the facts.‚Äù This anticipated the study by Nobel-laureate Robert Fogel, who would later conclude the same thing.

G. Wells advocating socialism. Published by the Fabian Society, This Misery of Boots is the expansion of a 1905 essay with the same name. Its five chapters condemn private property in land and means of production and calls for their expropriation by the state \\"not for profit, but for service.\\"H.G. Wells, This Misery of Boots (London: The Fabian Society, 1907), Ch. 3. Synopsis Chapter 1: The World as Boots and Superstructure Wells's point of departure is a reminiscence of a conversation with \\"a realistic novelist . . . a man from whom hope had departed.\\" An encounter with a limping tramp spurs a discussion of the 10‚Äì20% of the British population that suffers from \\"this misery of the boot.\\" They classify the various sources of discomfort (bad material, bad fit, bad condition, various sorts of chafe, the wear of the sole, splitting and leaks, etc.) and agree that most boots are a constant source of ‚Äústress, giving pain and discomfort, causing trouble, causing anxiety.‚Äù But Wells's friend finds the subject too depressing to continue: ‚ÄúIt does not do to think about boots,H.G. Wells, This Misery of Boots (London: The Fabian Society, 1907), Ch. 1. he exclaims. Chapter 2: People Whose Boots Don‚Äôt Hurt Them Wells, however, disagrees. \\"[A]ll these miseries are preventable miseries, which it lies in the power of men to cure,\\" he proclaims, and cites another friend who has achieved prosperity and no longer endures \\"the miseries of boots\\" but now suffers all the more, albeit vicariously, from the miseries of others, because he no longer believes that they are \\"in the very nature of things.\\" He blames the statesmen who \\"ought to have foreseen and prevented this.\\" Wells exhorts his readers not to \\"be humbugged for a moment into believing that this is the dingy lot of all mankind. . . . Don't say for a moment: 'Such is life.'\\"H.G. Wells, This Misery of Boots (London: The Fabian Society, 1907), Ch. 2. Chapter 3: At This Point a Dispute Arises Wells says he is not advocating a \\"childish and impossible equality,\\" but insisting that \\"There is enough good leather in the world to make good sightly boots and shoes for all who need them, enough men at leisure and enough power and machinery to do all the work required, enough unemployed intelligence to organise the shoemaking and shoe distribution for everybody.\\" What prevents this is \\"this institution of Private Property in land and naturally produced things,\\" the \\"claim and profit\\" of \\"land-owners, cattle-owners, house-owners, owners of all sorts.\\" The solution lies in \\"refusing to have private property in all these universally necessary things.\\" Wells endorses expropriation by \\"the State\\" and the administration of land, railways, shipping, and businesses \\"not for profit, but for service.\\"H.G. Wells, This Misery of Boots (London: The Fabian Society, 1907), Ch. 3. William J. Hyde calls Wells's view of property \\"the somewhat conventional socialist's view.\\" William J. Hyde, \\"The Socialism of H.G. Wells in the Early Twentieth Century,\\" Journal of the History of Ideas 17.2 (April 1956). Chapter 4: Is Socialism Possible? Private property in land and \\"many things of general utility\\" is no more \\"necessary and unavoidable\\" than \\"private property in our fellow-creatures, or private property in bridges and roads.\\" Wells denies any owner's right to compensation, but adds that \\"it is quite conceivable that we may partially compensate the property owners and make all sorts of mitigating arrangements.\\" Wells denies that the rich will uniformly oppose socialism and asserts that many of this class will see that they would be \\"happier and more comfortable in a Socialistic state of affairs.\\" It is, rather, \\"the ignorance, the want of courage, and the stupid want of imagination of the very poor\\" that is more likely to \\"obstruct the way to Socialism.\\"H.G. Wells, This Misery of Boots (London: The Fabian Society, 1907), Ch. 4. Chapter 5: Socialism Means Revolution Wells argues that socialism requires \\"a complete change, a break with history. . . . The whole system has to be changed.\\" \\"If you demand less than that, if you are not prepared to struggle for that, you are not really a Socialist.\\" The essential problem is to enlist \\"the self-abnegation, the enthusiasm, and the loyal cooperation of great masses of people.\\" To that end, Wells calls on socialists to persuade others, organize their movement, and clarify their beliefs. \\"For us, as for the early Christians, preaching our gospel is the supreme duty.\\" His final piece of advice: \\"Cling to the simple essential idea of Socialism, which is the abolition of private property in anything but what a man has earned or made.\\"H.G. Wells, This Misery of Boots (London: The Fabian Society, 1907), Ch. 5. Background Wells had considered himself a socialist since the mid-1880s, but his socialism was one marked by \\"a unique personal bias\\" and \\"is always projected toward a world order.\\"William J. Hyde, \\"The Socialism of H.G. Wells in the Early Twentieth Century,\\" Journal of the History of Ideas 17.2 (April 1956), p. 217. In 1886-1889 Wells had undertaken a study of the classic utopian writings of the Western tradition, and in the 1890s he integrated his socialistic beliefs with his views on evolution. He read psychology to seek practical insights. In the first decade of the twentieth century Wells refined his views, writing many essays and four book-length works promoting socialism: Mankind in the Making (1903), A Modern Utopia (1905), Socialism and the Family (1906), and New Worlds for Old (1908).David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 91-102. Wells joined the Fabian Society on March 13, 1903.Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 159. He remained a member until 1908. Redaction Wells had published an article entitled The Misery of Boots in Vol. 7, No. 27, of the Independent Review (December 1905), a magazine founded in 1904. He worked this up into a talk delivered to the Fabian Society on 12 January 1906. Despite its implicit criticism of Sidney and Beatrice Webb as engaged merely in \\"odd little jobbing about municipal gas and water,\\"H.G. Wells, This Misery of Boots (London: The Fabian Society, 1907), Ch. 5. Wells's talk was received with enthusiasm, and it was reprinted in 1907 as a Fabian pamphlet.Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 173. But its publication was delayed because Wells was engaged in an effort to wrest control of the Fabian Society away from the Webbs, among others, and some of his remarks in This Misery of Boots were perceived as \\"sneers\\" at the Webbs.Norman and Jeanne MacKenzie, H.G.

He was part of the Argentina sevens team before joining Leicester in 2009 following his full international d√©but against that summer. Career 2009‚Äì10 season He was given a trial by Leicester before the start of the 2009/10 season, he was later given a full contract ahead of French international Nicolas Jeanjean who was also at Leicester on a trial basis at the time. Gonz√°lez Amorosino made an instant impression, scoring 4 tries in his first 6 matches, including 2 in the opening two rounds of the Heineken Cup and one in Leicester's win against a South African touring XV at Welford Road. However he suffered a stress fracture in his leg early in November in an LV Cup match and missed the 2010 November internationals. The Argentina management hit out at Leicester for playing him in two matches in three days. He returned from his injury in January 2010 but from this point onwards he played very little for Leicester, despite the good start to his career at Leicester. Gonz√°lez Amorosino played for Argentina during the 2010 mid year tests against Scotland and France, starting 2 of the 3 matches. 2010‚Äì11 season Lucas was given very few chances in his second season, he played just 3 matches in which he scored 2 tries. He played for Argentina during the 2010 November internationals, and played well setting up a try against in the Pumas victory over Italy. He left Leicester at the end of the season and joined French Top 14 side Montpellier in search of game time. On Amorosino's departure the Leicester coach Richard Cockerill commented \\"he has not developed and come on as well as we would have both liked.\\" However it could be said that Amorosino was unfairly ignored during his time at Leicester. In total Amorosino scored 6 tries in 11 starts for Leicester. Gonz√°lez Amorosino played for Argentina in the 2011 mid year tests and was selected for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. 2011‚Äì12 season Lucas played for Argentina in the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and played in all the Pumas matches apart from the first match against England. He was named man of the match against Romania, earning himself a place on the bench against Scotland. Against Scotland he scored the late match winning try for Argentina to help them through to the quarter finals, the try was seen as one of the best of the tournament. Amorosino made the second highest linebreaker throughout the World Cup. Once Gonz√°lez Amorosino arrived back from the World Cup to his new club Montpellier, he started very well and was named by French rugby newspaper Midi Olympique as the player of the round 12. 2015‚Äì16 season He was part of Argentine squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England.

Agostino Rocca (1895 ‚Äì 17 February 1978) was an Italian businessman. Life and times Agostino Rocca was born in 1895 in Milan. His family relocated to Rome early in his childhood, and he completed secondary school studies at the Collegio Militare di Roma. He enrolled at the Accademia Militare di Torino in 1913, but left to enroll in the Italian Army at the outset of World War I. During the war he saw combat against Austro-Hungarian forces. Following the war, he enrolled in the Politecnico di Milano in 1921 to study enginerring and married Maria Queirazza. Rocca began as an engineering apprentice at Dalmine, a steel maker, in 1923. He later became a financial advisor, and worked for a number of prominent Italian firms, mainly in the manufacturing sector. He was made part of the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI), the centerpiece of the Mussolini regime's corporate state, in 1933, and joined the body's military industries committee, becoming a member of the board of directors of a number of venerable names in Italian industry and engineering, notably Dalmine and Ansaldo, and overseeing their conversion into defense contractors ahead of hostilities leading to World War II. He was appointed to the powerful post of director of Finsider, the IRI's financial arm, in 1938, but began distancing himself from Mussolini in 1941, and was dismissed. The transfer of the retreating Mussolini regime into northern Italy, and the declaration of the Italian Social Republic over the area in 1943, led Rocca to break with the regime, joining the British-sponsored opposition group Otto, and suffering arrest in Asti and Milan. Following the fall of the regime, he was arrested in Milan in April 1945 on the charge of collaborationism, but no longer an executive or administrator, and a belated opponent of the deposed fascist state, Rocca was released without charges. He founded the Compagnia Tecnica Internazionale (Italian, Technical International Company) in September 1945. Founded in Milan, Rocca's fledgling company was renamed as Techint, its abbreviated telex code.The Independent Awarded a contract to build a 1,600 km (1,000 mi) gas pipeline from Comodoro Rivadavia to Buenos Aires in 1949 by President Juan Per√≥n, Techint became a leading government contractor during Per√≥n's ambitious infrastructure program. Establishing subsidiaries in Brazil (1947), Chile (1951), and Mexico (1954), the company purchased a majority stake in Dalmine (Rocca's erstwhile employer), in 1954, and opened its first seamless steel tube plant in Campana, the same year. Techint's Ensenada plant, in 1969, became the only Argentine manufacturer of cold rolled steel. These developments prompted the Argentine government to enter into a tentative partnership with Techint through its state steel concern, Somisa. The joint venture with Techint's Propulsora Siderurgica was first announced in 1967, though, ultimately, a similar arrangement was concluded instead with a leading competitor, Acindar.R√≠o Negro: Significativa propuesta realizada a Acindar The aging industrialist transferred management of the company to his elder son, Roberto Rocca, in 1975, and died in Buenos Aires on February 17, 1978, at age 83.

As one of the four stars in the Keystone asterism (see yellow quadrangle), it is one of the constellation's more easily recognized. It has an apparent visual magnitude of +3.2, which is visible to the naked eye and makes it one of its brighter members. The Hipparcos satellite mission estimated its distance at roughly 115 parsecs from Earth, or about 377 light years away. The overall reduction in the star's visual magnitude due to extinction from the intervening matter is 0.11.  Properties  The star Pi Herculis, rendered with Celestia software, as it might appear from 3 Astronomical Units away. Pi Herculis is a bright giant star with a stellar classification of K3 II. P.C. Keenan and R. E. Pitts (1980) graded it as a spectral type K3 IIab and it is sometimes listed with this alternate classification. The star is enormous compared to the Sun, having a mass that is 4.5 times solar and a radius approximately 60 times depending on which wavelength the star's angular diameter is measured at. Due to limb darkening, all giant and supergiant stars present unique challenges when measuring their photosphere. This orange-hued giant shines with 1,330 times the luminosity of the Sun. It is a low-amplitude photometric variable star showing a typical change of roughly 0.0054 in magnitude over a 24-hour period.  Possible planetary system  Low-amplitude radial velocity variations with a period of 613 days in the bright giant have suggested the possible presence of a substellar companion. If this is really due to a low-mass object, such a companion would be as small as 0.027 Solar masses (27 times the mass of Jupiter, probably a brown dwarf) and 3 astronomical units away from the bright primary. A substellar companion is only one of several hypotheses to explain the star's behaviour. Most likely the cause of the variation is weak pulsation of the star's atmosphere. With a luminosity more than 1,000 times that of the Sun, an orbit where a planet could be habitable would be located 37 AU away from Pi Herculis‚Äîin Solar System terms, halfway between Neptune and Pluto's orbits.

Predominately a Militia formation, the division's main role during the war was as a base command headquarters, although elements saw action in New Guinea against Japanese forces during the Finisterre Range campaign and in New Britain. It was disbanded in July 1946. History In July 1942, a headquarters was raised to command the units that had been sent to Milne Bay, to establish a series of airfields there after the Battle of the Coral Sea. The majority of the staff for this headquarters came from the 1st Division, and at the time of its establishment it was called \\"C Force\\" and became Milne Force in August 1942. Only a limited number of troops were assigned, with the first elements being two companies of Militia troops from the 55th Battalion, bolstered later by the arrival of the 7th Infantry Brigade and then the 18th Infantry Brigade, a veteran Second Australian Imperial Force unit. Throughout late August and early September, the Japanese attempted to land troops to capture the airfields and in the Battle of Milne Bay were defeated by the defending Milne Force elements. In October, the 17th Infantry Brigade arrived to relieved the 18th, which was despatched to Buna in December 1942. It was decided that the formation would assume a more active role and in December 1942, Milne Force was renamed the 11th Division. Upon establishment, the division was commanded by Major-General Cyril Clowes. It remained around Milne Bay until January 1943, when the 5th Division arrived to relieve it and the division was transferred to Port Moresby. At Moresby, the 11th Division headquarters relieved the 6th Division staff and took the base units, including the 7th Brigade, under command. A further move occurred in July 1943, when the divisional headquarters was flown to Dobodura, assuming responsibility for the area between Oro Bay and Buna from the US 41st Infantry Division. The division commanded the 6th and 29th Infantry Brigades, both Militia formations. The 29th was transferred to the 3rd Division in August to take part in the fighting around Salamaua. Commander of the 11th Division, Major-General Allan Boase, with staff officers at Dobodura, October 1943 In September 1943, Major- General Allan Boase took command of the division. The following month division came under the control of II Corps having previously been assigned to I Corps (and before that New Guinea Force). The divisional headquarters moved to Lae in February 1944, relieving the 5th Division, which was transferred to Finschhafen to relieve the 9th Division. At Lae, the division resumed the base command with the 29th Brigade as its only fighting formation. In April 1944, the corps' headquarters moved to Dumpu and it later relieved the 7th Division, which had been fighting a campaign through the Markham and Ramu Valleys and into the Finisterre Ranges. Assuming control of the 15th and 18th Infantry Brigades, the division continued the advance towards Madang, linking with the 5th Division around Bogadjim, before being moved back to Wau in early May 1944, leaving its divisional carrier company at Dumpu and transferring several units to the 5th Division. Headquarters returned to Lae in this time, although the 6th Infantry Brigade was pushed forward to Bulolo in June 1944. Following this, the divisional headquarters was relieved by the 3rd Division in July 1944 and returned to Australia, later to be reconstituted on the Atherton Tablelands around Kairi, in Queensland. In August, the division moved to Mapee. The 11th became one of six Australian divisions converted to the Jungle division establishment. The division later fought a brief campaign on New Britain in the last year of the war, landing at Jacquinot Bay and taking over from the 5th Division in July 1945. On New Britain, the division assumed command of the 4th and 13th Infantry Brigades. These formations pushed towards Wide Bay and Open Bay, as the Australians sought to contain the much larger Japanese garrison on the Gazelle Peninsula, rather than carry out a direct assault on the main Japanese position at Rabaul. In August, the war came to an end and the 11th Division entered Rabaul and oversaw the surrender of the Japanese garrison. Division headquarters remained in Rabaul until late April 1946 during which its constituent units and elements of its staff were repatriated to Australia in individual drafts. On 25 April 1946, its remaining cadre of 20 personnel embarked on SS Ormiston, bound for Sydney. The disbandment of the 11th Division was completed by 1 July 1946, when the last personnel marched out for demobilisation. Some personnel from the division later served in the 67th Infantry Battalion, undertaking occupation duties as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan..

It derives from the SGI compilers for the MIPS architecture R10000 processor, called MIPSPro. After being acquired and re-sold, by March 24 2017, Pathscale was reported to be looking for another buyer of its assets. As of May 2017 its open source compiler has been removed from its GitHub account and the official company web site is down. History PathScale was founded in 2001 as Key Research and its original mission was to develop clustered Linux server solutions based on a low-cost 64-bit design. In late 2003 the company came out of stealth mode and was called PathScale. The word PathScale is descriptive of the company's original design goals for clusters. In early 2003 with the success of the AMD Opteron, efforts at the company switched to other products like high-performance 64-bit compilers. The seeds of the company were sown over 20 years ago at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Four of the company's seven founders all worked together building the S1 supercomputer back in the early 1980s. The first chief technical officer at PathScale, Tom McWilliams, had the initial idea for the company and incorporated in July 2001. He added three of his LLNL colleagues (Jeff Rubin, Jeff Broughton, Fred Chow) to the company shortly thereafter. McWilliams had been a company founder at Valid Logic Systems and Key Computer and worked at SGI, Sun Microsystems and Amdahl Corporation. Chow was formerly chief scientist for compilers at SGI and MIPS. PathScale Inc. was acquired and re-sold several times. First by QLogic in February 2006, for about $109 million. A network technology called InfiniPath was marketed as TrueScale by QLogic, and then sold to Intel and became the basis of Omni-Path. The compiler technology was acquired by SiCortex in August 2007, and by Cray in August 2009, when SiCortex was liquidated. Cray owned the intellectual property until March 2012 when a new PathScale Inc. acquired all assets.

They have lived alone for years in their own private world. Sometimes they seem like brothers. Sometimes even like lovers. Despite knowing that all sons must one day live their own lives, Aleksei is conflicted. The father knows he should accept a better job in another city, perhaps search for a new wife. The film begins by showing The Father comforting his son Aleksei, who just has a nightmare. Following in his father's path, Aleksei attends military school. He likes sports, tends to be irresponsible and has problems with his girlfriend, who is jealous of Aleksei's close relationship with his father. Eventually she breaks up with him. During the weekend, Fyodor comes visiting the Father, who served with his own father in the army, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of the latter. Fyodor revealed to Aleksei that he also visited the previous night, but The Father did not tell Aleksei about it.

He was also known as Liu Jinchen (Hanyu Pinyin), or Liu Chin-ch'en (Wade-Giles) (). Biography Liu Baojun was born in 1892 in the village () of Caozhou. He was a master of Meihuaquan, a style that he may have learned from Kong Qingbiao. After working as a bodyguard, from 1925 onwards he taught in Peixian. He was executed in 1947, accused of collaborating with the Japanese occupation army. From the transcript of a short interview with Chang Yu-shin, son of Chang Dsu Yao (a famous student of Liu Baojun, who later moved to Italy): In October 1925 Liu Baojun participated in a competition in Nanjing, where he won a pair of double sabres (shuangdao) as a prize. In 1937, in Peixian, he participated in a competition in which he won a banner with a golden dart as a prize. Master Liu was a direct-lineage student of Yang style tai chi chuan Grandmaster Yang Chengfu, as evidenced in Yang Chengfu's first book, the Taijiquan Shiyongfa, that contains the list of his disciples, where Liu Baojun's name appears. Liu Baojun and Meihuaquan Liu Baojun belonged to the Bai branch of the Meihuaquan martial art family (Baijiazhi Meihuaquan). When he moved to Peixian, he created his own branch of the style, which was later called, in his honor, Liupai Meihuaquan (Boxing of the Plum Flower, of the School of Liu.) Initially he taught with Li Zhengting, who was from the Luodi Meihuaquan family, but they later parted ways. His most famous students in Peixian were Chang Dsu Yao, Fang Dunyi (), Fang Dunle (), Zhao Houfu (), and others.

The swelling can increase until it ruptures and drains. It can be caused by infection from Actinomyces bovis or Brucella abortus organisms, but may also occur due to parasite infestation, skin trauma, or badly fitting horse tack. Because of modern efforts to reduce the incidence of brucellosis in livestock, horses are less exposed to the Brucella abortus organism, and hence most modern cases of poll evil arise from trauma linked to a horse striking its head against poorly designed or low-clearance structures, or to improper use of equipment, particularly leaving a halter on the horse around the clock. The term has been in use since at least the 1750s. Before modern antibiotics were developed, the condition was very difficult to treat. In the 18th century, it was treated with remedies such as vinegar, wine, elder flower and even turpentine. Today, cases caught early can be cleaned with peroxide, ice packs and diluted dimethyl sulfoxide solution, with antibiotics used to prevent or slow infection. If the infection has set in and there is a discharge, antibiotic treatment along with hot packs and surgery under local anesthesia to remove infected and dead tissue is usually required. Fistulous withers is a similar condition but on the animal's withers.Henson, Frances (2009) Equine Back Pathology: Diagnosis and Treatment, John Wiley and Sons, , p.163 References Category:Horse diseases ","title":"Poll evil"},{"id":"24996834","text":"Map showing ancient Thessaly.

As well as maintaining a registry of pedigrees, the club promotes and sanctions events for purebred dogs, including annual dog shows and specialty shows. The Kennel Club of India is a member of the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale. The Kennel Club of India is also one of the few kennel clubs to be members of the International Organization for Standardization. History There were several established kennel clubs in India during the British colonial period from 1857 to 1947, including in Hyderabad, Ootacamund, Mysore, and Calcutta. These clubs followed procedures followed in kennel clubs in the United Kingdom. It was much after independence that the idea for a centralized structure for all these kennel clubs across the country was conceived. The Kennel Club of India was established in 1978. Today The Kennel Club of India is the leading authority on registration on purebreds and maintains the only recognized registry. It issues Pedigrees for purebreds and litters. It hosts annual shows across the country and awards championships to various breeds of dogs. The 2019 chairman of KCI is Mr. S. Pathy who has shown and bred dogs for over forty years under the kennel name \\"Sans Craintes\\" (meaning \\"without fear\\" in French). Pathy is also a member of the Singapore Kennel Club and an all-breeds judge. He has bred a few \\"Dog of the Year\\" winners and bred Dobermans, Labradors, Siberian Huskies and other breeds. C.V. Sudarsan, an expert on whippets is the secretary. Registration The Kennel Club of India registers litters of puppies born in India whose sire and dam have both been registered (listed as \\"Bred in India\\"). The club also registers puppies and dogs that have been imported from other countries. The club also registers puppies and dogs that are purebred but whose parents do not carry any papers. These dogs are registered as purebreds with \\"unknown pedigree\\". Pedigree papers or certificates are issued by the club and are continuously appended as the dog keeps winning championships or keeps changing owners. The most common breeds registered by the Kennel Club of India are Great Danes, Rottweilers, Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, Dachshunds, Dalmatians, Dobermanns and Pugs. Dog shows Specialty and general dog shows are conducted by the Kennel Club of India all over the country. These shows are generally held from December to May. The shows follow procedures and guidelines complying with regulations of the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale. Dogs are issued challenge certificates and championship certificates. Dogs are awarded points (depending on their breed and temperament) in every dog show and at the end of the year. The dog receiving the most show points receives the Dog of the Year award. The other awards include: Best in Class, Best of Breed, Best in Group, Best in Show The club also has awards for breeders of the year and also a special award for \\"Bred in India\\" dogs to encourage breeders to develop good bloodlines in India. Specialty dog shows In addition to general dog shows, the kennel Club of India organizes specialty dog shows meant for particular breeds only. This include dog shows for separate breeds. Many breeds in India have their own clubs that participate in these events. These clubs include: * German Shepherd Dog Club of India * Great Dane Club of India * Indian Sieger Show * The Labrador Retriever Club Of India * Tamil Nadu Rottweiler Association * Great Dane Club Of India (South) The Indian Kennel Gazette In addition to the shows, the Kennel Club of India publishes a monthly magazine, the Indian Kennel Gazette for all its members.

It is considered a part of the larger Aizu campaign. Background On September 20, 1868 the pro-Sh≈çgunate ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei was proclaimed at Morioka, capital of the Nanbu clan who rule Morioka Domain. The territory of the Nambu extended along the northeastern half of Mutsu Province, as far north as Shimokita Peninsula, and the Nambu controlled a subsidiary domain at Hachinohe. The northwest of Mutsu Province was dominated by the Nambu clan's hereditary rivals, the Tsugaru clan of Hirosaki Domain, with a subsidiary domain at Kuroishi.Koyasu Nobushige (1880), Buke kazoku meiyoden vol. 1 (Tokyo: Koyasu Nobushige), p. 25. (Accessed from National Diet Library , 17 July 2008) The Tsugaru first sided with the pro-imperial forces of Satch≈ç Alliance, and attacked nearby Sh≈çnai Domain.McClellan, p. 175.Mark Ravina (1999), Land and Lordship in Early Modern Japan (California: Stanford University Press), pp. 152-153. However, the Tsugaru soon switched course, and briefly became a member of the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei.Onodera, p. 140. However, for reasons yet unclear, the Tsugaru backed out of the alliance and re-joined the imperial cause after a few months. The village of Noheji in what is now part of Aomori Prefecture was an important port for the Nambu clan on Mutsu Bay. Noheji was garrisoned by approximately 400 men from Hachinohe Domain after the defection of the Tsugaru back to the imperial side. The port was shelled by Kubota Domain warship Shunyo-maru commanded by Saga Domain's Nakamuta Kuranosuke on September 10, but with little damage to the village or reported casualties. The battle In the pre-dawn hours of September 23, a force of 180 men from Hirosaki and Kuroishi Domains, divided into three companies, converged on Noheji, capturing the outlying hamlet of Makado, which they fired, destroying 64 homes and one Buddhist temple. The Nambu garrison at Noheji responded to the fire, coming under attack as they approached the burning hamlet. The Nambu forces attempted to encircle the Tsugaru attackers to cut off their escape, with only partial success. In the ensuing melee, Tsugaru forces managed to penetrate into the village to almost within sight of the Nambu garrison headquarters before the death of their leader, Kojima Nagayoshi, sparked a retreat. Accounts of the number of casualties of the battle vary widely. Based on the number of graves at the cemetery at Noheji, at least 27 men from both sides perished and were buried in the town. Per the official domain records from Hirosaki Domain, the Tsugaru clan lost 29 men, and similar records from the Nambu clan indicate losses of 45 men on the Nambu side. Consequences As a result of this minor skirmish, Tsugaru Domain was able to prove its defection from the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei and loyalty to the imperial cause. Tsugaru forces later joined the imperial army in attacking the Republic of Ezo at Hakodate.Koyasu, Buke kazoku meiyoden vol. 1, p. 6. As a result, the entire clan was able to evade the punishment meted out by the government on the northern domains after the establishment of the Meiji government.Ravina, p. 153. On November 6, 1869, Hirosaki Domain dispatched two emissaries to Noheji, to meet with the leaders of Makado hamlet. The emissaries claimed that the Tsugaru clan had been forced into attacking Noheji under pressure from Saga Domain, and offered rice and timber for the rebuilding of the hamlet.

As now circumscribed, the family includes about 170 species grouped in about 11 genera, including Cannabis (hemp, marijuana), Humulus (hops) and Celtis (hackberries). Celtis is by far the largest genus, containing about 100 species.Stevens, P.F. (2001 onwards) \\"Cannabaceae\\", Angiosperm Phylogeny Website, retrieved 2014-02-25 Cannabaceae is of the rose order (Rosales). Members of the family are erect or climbing plants with petalless flowers and dry, one-seeded fruits. Hemp (Cannabis) and hop (Humulus) are the only economically important species. Other than a shared evolutionary origin, members of the family have few common characteristics; some are trees (e.g. Celtis), others are herbaceous plants (e.g. Cannabis). Description Members of this family can be trees (e.g. Celtis), erect herbs (e.g. Cannabis), or twining herbs (e.g. Humulus). Leaves are often more or less palmately lobed or palmately compound and always bear stipules. Cystoliths are always present and some members of this family possess laticifers. Cannabaceae are often dioecious (distinct male and female plants). The flowers are actinomorphic (radially symmetrical) and not showy, as these plants are pollinated by the wind. As an adaptation to this kind of pollination, the calyx is short and there is no corolla. Flowers are grouped to form cymes. In the dioecious plants the masculine inflorescences are long and look like panicles, while the feminine are shorter and bear fewer flowers. The pistil is made of two connate carpels, the usually superior ovary is unilocular; there is no fixed number of stamens. The fruit can be an achene or a drupe. Classification Classification systems developed prior to the 1990s, such as those of Cronquist (1981) and Dahlgren (1989), typically recognized the order Urticales, which included the families Cannabaceae, Cecropiaceae, Celtidaceae, Moraceae, Ulmaceae and Urticaceae, as then circumscribed. Molecular data from 1990s onwards showed that these families were actually embedded within the order Rosales, so that from the first classification by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group in 1998, they were placed in an expanded Rosales, forming a group which has been called \\"urticalean rosids\\". Genera Humulus lupulus with nearly mature fruits (hops) Cannabaceae comprises the following genera: * Aphananthe Planch. (5 spp.) * Cannabis L.‚ÄîHemp (1 sp.) * Celtis L. (73‚Äì109 spp.) * Chaetachme Planch. (1 sp.) * Gironniera Gaudich. (6 spp.) * Humulus L.‚ÄîHop (3 spp.) * Lozanella Greenm. (2 spp.) * Parasponia Miq. (5‚Äì10 spp.) * Pteroceltis Maxim. (1 sp.) * Trema Lour. (12‚Äì42 spp.) Phylogeny Modern molecular phylogenetics suggest the following relationships: Uses Carbon dating has revealed that these plants may have been used for ritual/medicinal purposes in Xinjiang, China as early as 494 B.C. Hop (Humulus lupulus) has been the predominant bittering agent of beer for hundreds of years. The flowers' resins are responsible for beer's bitterness and their ability to extend shelf life due to some anti-microbial qualities. The young shoots are used as vegetable. Some plants in the genus Cannabis are cultivated as hemp for the production of fiber, as a source of cheap oil, for their nutritious seeds, or their edible leaves. Others are cultivated for medical or recreational use as marijuana. Induced parthenocarpy in pistilate flowers, and selective breeding are used to produce either higher or lower yields of THC, other cannabinoids, as well as terpenes with desired flavors or aromas, such as blueberry, strawberry, or even citrus. Many trees in the genus Celtis are grown for landscaping and ornamental purposes.

Verostko developed his own software for generating original art based on form ideas he had developed as an artist in the 1960s. His software controls the drawing arm of a machine known as a pen plotter that was designed primarily for engineering and architectural drawing. In coding his software Verostko conceives of the machine's drawing arm as an extension or prosthesis for his own drawing arm. The plotter normally draws with ink pens but Verostko adapted oriental brushes to fit the drawing arm and wrote interactive routines for achieving brush strokes with his plotters. In 1995, he co-founded the Algorists with Jean-Pierre H√©bert. Biography Roman Verostko was born in Tarrs, Pennsylvania, a coal-mining town fifty miles east of Pittsburgh. A painter in his early life, he also studied as a Benedictine monk at Saint Vincent Seminary in Latrobe, Pennsylvania from 1952 to 1968, joining the faculty there in 1963. His monastic travels took him to places such as New York, Washington, and Paris. After leaving religious life in 1968, he continued experimenting with automatic drawing that led him to explore methods of writing code to achieve some form of computer automatism. This led him to redirect all his artistic practices toward algorithmic art. He married Alice Wagstaff in August 1968. She was a psychologist and gave seminars at the monastery when Verostko met her. She died in 2009.Minnesota's Roman Verostko, the grandfather of computer art StarTribune. Retrieved 9 June 2014. He now resides in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he taught at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design (MCAD) from 1968 to 1994 and holds the title of Professor Emeritus. Education After graduating from high school, Verostko studied at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, where he received a diploma in illustration in 1949. In 1950 he entered the Saint Vincent Archabbey scholastic program for monks that included entrance to Saint Vincent College, monastic vows in 1954, a BA in philosophy in 1955,four years of Theology in the St. Vincent Major Seminary and ordination as a priest in 1959. While Verostko remained a monk attached to Saint Vincent Archabbey, he pursued graduate work in the early 1960s at other institutions, first in an MFA program at Pratt Institute in 1961, then studies in art history at New York University and Columbia University from 1961 to 1962. Verostko then traveled to Paris, where he studied printmaking at Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17 from 1962 to 1963, as well as took courses at the √âcole du Louvre and visited religious sites. Much of Verostko's work in Paris \\"pursued visual manifestations of inner experience that transcended rational observation\\". For many of these 'automatic' works he maintained a private notebook of 'experience states' related to their execution\\". Perhaps unsurprisingly, Hayter worked very closely with the Surrealists, exploring semi-automated methodologies for image-making in the belief that its source was the irrational. Hayter also associated with many of the forerunners of the Algorists, among them Le Corbusier. Many of the themes Verostko would explore in his life's work - EXAMPLES - emerged in this time period in and around Paris. He resumed creating abstract expressionist paintings and toured an innovative light-and- sound show he had created based on the Psalms, while editing the New Catholic Encyclopedia in Washington, D.C. Verostko wrote his first code in punch cards at the Control Data Institute in the late 1960s. In the summer of 1970, with a Bush Foundation Fellows Grant to explore \\"the humanization of new technologies\\", he worked with Gyorgy Kepes at MIT's Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS). \\"But my real coding work began with the first personal computers, the Apples we had in '78 and the IBM that came out in August 1981,\\" he said. Artworks In 1982, Verostko developed an interactive program which produced a computer-generated light show called the \\"Magic Hand of Chance\\". It was a mere 32 kb in size and was written in the computer language BASIC on a first-generation IBM PC. The \\"Magic Hand\\" was capable of running for days without repeating itself. He went on to create his Hodos software, an integrated program of routines that, to his mind, attempted to mime some of the procedures he had used in his pre-algorist years. His first pen plotter, a Houston Instruments DMP-52, with 14 pen stalls, provided a rich palette of inks for his drawing routines. He also created routines for driving oriental brushes adapted to the machine's drawing arm. By 1987 he had integrated expressive brush strokes with colorful clusters of pen strokes. Examples of his algorithmic plotter work include the Pathway series, the Pearl Park Scriptures, the Diamond Lake Apocalypse and the Manchester Illuminated Universal Turing Machine, produced in honor of Alan Turing. In 1990, Verostko published an artist's book in honor of George Boole, in a limited edition.Verostko, Roman (1990). Derivation of the laws of the symbols of logic. Minneapolis : St. Sebastian Press. . Each copy of the book contains unique multi-pen plotter drawings with the frontispiece including a single brush stroke created using the same algorithm. In 2008, Verostko installed an \\"upside-down\\" mural, with 11 units spanning two stories inside the main entrance of the Fred Rogers Early Childhood Learning Center located on the Saint Vincent College campus, Latrobe, Pennsylvania. The images are digital transformations of his original pen and ink drawings created for an \\"Upsidedown Book\\" in the 1970s.

This form of art has circumvented the traditional dominance of the gallery and museum system, delivering aesthetic experiences via the Internet. In many cases, the viewer is drawn into some kind of interaction with the work of art. Artists working in this manner are sometimes referred to as net artists. Internet art can happen outside the technical structure of the Internet, such as when artists use specific social or cultural Internet traditions in a project outside it. Internet art is often‚Äîbut not always‚Äîinteractive, participatory, and multimedia-based. Internet art can be used to spread a message, either political or social, using human interactions. The term Internet art typically does not refer to art that has been simply digitized and uploaded to be viewable over the Internet. This can be done through a web browser, such as images of paintings uploaded for viewing in an online gallery. Rather, this genre relies intrinsically on the Internet to exist, taking advantage of such aspects as an interactive interface and connectivity to multiple social and economic cultures and micro- cultures. It refers to the Internet as a whole, not only to web-based works. Theorist and curator Jon Ippolito defined \\"Ten Myths\\" about Internet art in 2002. He cites the above stipulations, as well as defining it as distinct from commercial web design, and touching on issues of permanence, archivability, and collecting in a fluid medium. History and context Internet art is rooted in disparate artistic traditions and movements, ranging from Dada to Situationism, conceptual art, Fluxus, video art, kinetic art, performance art, telematic art and happenings. In 1974, Canadian artist Vera Frenkel worked with the Bell Canada Teleconferencing Studios to produce the work String Games: Improvisations for Inter-City Video, the first artwork in Canada to use telecommunications technologies. An early telematic artwork was Roy Ascott's work, La Plissure du Texte, (Unedited transcript including organizational discussion.) performed in collaboration created for an exhibition at the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1983. Media art institutions such as Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, or the Paris-based IRCAM (a research center for electronic music), would also support or present early Networked art. In 1997 MIT's List Visual Arts Center hosted \\"PORT: Navigating Digital Culture,\\" that included internet art in a gallery space and \\"time-based Internet projects.\\"https://www.artnetweb.com/port/ Artists in the show included Cary Peppermint, Prema Murthy, Ricardo Dominguez, and Adrianne Wortzel. In 2000 the Whitney Museum of American Art included net art in their Biennial exhibit.The Whitney Biennial 2000. See also \\"Now Anyone Can Be in the Whitney Biennial\\" in The New York Times (March 23, 2000), and \\"The Whitney Speaks: It Is Art\\" in Wired Magazine (March 23, 2000). It was the first time that internet art had been included as a special category in the Biennial, and it marked one of the earliest examples of the inclusion of internet art in a museum setting. Internet artists included Mark Amerika, Fakeshop, Ken Goldberg, and ¬Æ‚Ñ¢ark. With the rise of search engines as a gateway to accessing the web in the late 1990s, many net artists turned their attention to related themes. The 2001 'Data Dynamics' exhibit at the Whitney Museum featured 'Netomat' (Maciej Wisniewski) and 'Apartment' (Marek Walczak and Martin Wattenberg), which used search queries as raw material. Mary Flanagan's ' The Perpetual Bed' received attention for its novel use of 3D nonlinear narrative space, or what she called \\"navigable narratives.\\" Her 2001 work in the Whitney Biennial, 'collection' collected items from hard drives around the world and displayed them in a 'computational collective unconscious.' Golan Levin's 'The Secret Lives of Numbers' (2000) visualized the \\"popularity\\" of the numbers 1 to 1,000,000 as measured by Alta Vista search results. Such works pointed to alternative interfaces and questioned the dominant role of search engines in controlling access to the net. Nevertheless, the Internet is not reducible to the web, nor to search engines. Besides these unicast (point to point) applications, suggesting that there is some reference points, there is also a multicast (multipoint and uncentered) internet that has been explored by very few artistic experiences, such as the Poietic Generator. Internet art has, according to Juliff and Cox, suffered under the privileging of the user interface inherent within computer art. They argue that Internet is not synonymous with a specific user and specific interface, but rather a dynamic structure that encompasses coding and the artist's intention. The emergence of social networking platforms, understood to be \\"web-based services that allow individuals to... construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system... articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and... view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system\\", facilitated a transformative shift in the distribution of internet art. Early online communities were organized around specific \\"topical hierarchies\\", whereas social networking platforms consist of egocentric networks, with the \\"individual at the center of their own community\\". Artistic communities on the Internet underwent a similar transition in the mid-2000s, shifting from Surf Clubs, \\"15 to 30 person groups whose members contributed to an ongoing visual-conceptual conversation through the use of digital media\\" and whose membership was restricted to a select group of individuals, to image-based social networking platforms, like Flickr, which permit access to any individual with an e-mail address. Internet artists make extensive use of the networked capabilities of social networking platforms, and are rhizomatic in their organization, in that \\"production of meaning is externally contingent on a network of other artists' content\\".

The 2007 Hull City Council election took place on 3 May 2007 to elect members of Hull City Council in England. One third of the council was up for election and the Liberal Democrats gained overall control of the council from no overall control. Overall turnout was 27%. After the election, the composition of the council was *Liberal Democrat 30 *Labour 20 *Independent 7 *Conservative 2 Campaign Before the election the Liberal Democrats had run the council as a minority administration since the 2006 election. However, by the time of the 2007 election they only had 24 seats on the council as compared to 25 for the Labour party; with 2 Conservatives, 6 in the independent group and 2 other independent councillors making up the council. The Liberal Democrats generally received support from the Conservatives and one of the independent councillors, while Labour usually got support from the independent group. As a result, the election was expected to be close with both main parties hopeful of forming the administration after the election. All three of the Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservatives parties contested the 19 seats which were up for election. There were also 11 independent, 6 Green, 3 British National Party and 3 United Kingdom Independence Party candidates. An important issue in the election was poor housing in Hull, with the council planning to spend ¬£200 million on refurbishing council properties. An important division between Labour and the Liberal Democrats was over free school meals, with Labour wanting to extend the 3 year long pilot scheme which saw all primary school pupils get free meals. However the Liberal Democrats planned to reintroduce charges for lunches while keeping breakfasts free. As the Liberal Democrats were only defending 7 seats and had won the most votes in the 2006 election they were optimistic of making gains. They pointed to the fact that the council had recently received a second star in the council performance ratings, and were also seen as likely to benefit due to the unpopularity of the national Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, with even the Labour leader on the council saying that \\"the sooner he goes, the better\\". The Liberal Democrats targeted the Labour held wards of Drypool, Ings, Newington, Pickering and Sutton, as well as Derringham where the independent councillor Clare Page stood down at the election. Election result The results saw the Liberal Democrats gain 6 seats, including 5 from Labour, to hold 30 seats and thus win a majority on the council. The Liberal Democrat gains included all 6 wards which they had been targeting, with the results seen as a reflection on the Labour party nationally. The result was welcomed by the national Liberal Democrat leader, Menzies Campbell, who described the result in Hull as \\"tremendous\\". This was the first time any party had a majority on the council since 2002 and also the first time that the Liberal Democrats had ever won a majority in Hull. Meanwhile, Labour, on 20 seats after the election, were in their worst position on the council for nearly 40 years. Following the election defeat the leader of the Labour group on the council, Ken Branson, stood down as leader and was succeeded by Steve Brady. Ward results No elections were held in Bricknell, Southcoates East, Southcoates West and St Andrews wards.

She is best known for her work on grammaticalization, subjectification, and constructionalization. Traugott earned her BA in English Language at Oxford University in 1960 and her PhD in English Language at the University of California, Berkeley in 1964. She was a pioneer in generative historical syntax. Dissatisfaction with generative models led her to collaborate with Paul Hopper (Carnegie Mellon University) and develop a functional approach to grammaticalization, understood as the change whereby lexical items and constructions come in certain linguistic contexts to serve grammatical functions (Hopper and Traugott 1993, revised ed. 2003). More recently she has worked with Graeme Trousdale (University of Edinburgh) on constructionalization. Based in Construction Grammar, constructionalization provides a framework that incorporates several aspects of grammaticalization and lexicalization within a unified theory of how new meaning-new form constructions arise. Other interests include the development of pragmatic markers, especially those in utterance-final position.  Career  Elizabeth Traugott's initial appointment was in the English Department at the University of California, Berkeley (1964-1970). After year-long teaching appointments at the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and University of York, UK, she was appointed Associate Professor of Linguistics and English at Stanford University in 1970, and Professor in 1977. She served as Chair of the Department of Linguistics at Stanford University from 1980-1985 and as Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies from 1985-1991. Elizabeth Traugott was honored with honorary doctorates from Uppsala University (2006) and The University of Helsinki (2010).

It serves as the main railway terminal for the state under Keretapi Tanah Melayu offering KTM ETS services, as well as handling freight trains. Although there are 9 tracks, only four are electrified and three of the electrified tracks are used for the ETS service. The remaining 6 other tracks are used for freight trains. Designed by Arthur Benison Hubback, the current station was officially opened in 1917. Affectionately known as the Taj Mahal of Ipoh by its locals, the building also houses a station hotel called the Majestic Hotel.  Early history  The first Ipoh station was constructed in 1894 as railway tracks for the Perak Railway (PR) were first laid along Ipoh, serving the town for 20 years through the final years of the PR and its consolidation into the Federated Malay States Railways (FMSR). In 1914, construction of a second station and hotel to replace the first station began; dogged by material shortages and escalating costs of labour during the Great War, the station was only completed in 1917. The new double-storey station building was constructed with vastly larger space to not only house railway offices, but also Majestic Hotel, an enclose hotel that also boasted a restaurant and a bar. Originally offering 17 bedrooms which directly grant access to the second floor loggia, the hotel upgraded its number of rooms to 21 in 1936. For over 80 years, through the operational years of the FMSR and its eventual successor, Malayan Railways, the station's overall layout has remained largely unchanged since its construction due to minimal upgrading exercises throughout the wider Peninsular Malaysian railway network.  Architecture  Closeup of the Ipoh station's station building facade, depicting its ornate construction and scale relative to parked road vehicles. Like many early stations built under Perak Railway, the 1894 station's construction was rudimentary, consisting of a single-storey wooden structure with massive pitched tiled roofs and an overall open air layout. The 1917 station's design was conceptualised by Arthur Benison Hubback, a British architectural assistant to the Director of Public Works credited for designing various public buildings in British Malaya in various vernacular colonial Western styles as well as \\"Neo- Moorish/Mughal/Indo-Saracenic/Neo-Saracenic\\" styles that draw influences from British Indian colonial architecture. In contrast to the Kuala Lumpur railway station, the Ipoh station's exterior is more distinctively Western in design, drawing elements of late-Edwardian Baroque architecture and incorporating moderate rustication on the base of the ground floor, opened pointed and arched pediments, extensive use of engaged columns, and a large central dome over the porte-coch√®re, while integrating vernacular elements such as deep, open air loggias into the ground floor and upper floor of the building (the ground floor's loggia measures at 183 metres, the length of the station's frontage). In spite of its overall aesthetics, elements of Indo-Saracenic architecture are still found in the form of miniature chhatris towering over corner support columns on both sides of the structure. The 1917 station originally boasted three platforms; one side platform and two island platforms connected by tunnels, with steel-and-wood pitched canopies as shelter.  Electrification and reconstruction  As part of KTM's double tracking and electrification project between Ipoh and Rawang, the Ipoh station was significantly renovated over the course of the 2000s. The most dramatic change is the total rebuilding of the platform area, which composed of new platforms levelled to the height of train carriage entrances, as well as accommodation for newly laid double track and overhead lines; the upgrade also replaced the original tunnels between platforms and canopies with an overhead bridge and a curving steel-framed train shed, although the platforms' original wooden benches were retained in the process. Although some interior refurbishment on portions of the ground floor of the main building were also conducted, remaining elements of the station building, including the station's Majestic Hotel, were preserved. The overhaul was completed in October 2007, three months before the conclusion of railway electrification between Ipoh and Rawang.  Ipoh Station Square and Ipoh cenotaph  The Ipoh station is fronted by a large square known as the Ipoh Station Square. For much of its early history the square is a lawn sparsely lined with trees; a garden park was eventually built over the site over the course of the 1970s and 1980s, incorporating heavier vegetation, tiled and paved pathways, and a plaza containing sculptures and fountains. Between 2011 and 2013 the entire square was heavily stripped and rebuilt as an open plaza featuring minimalist terraces, and wider open lawn patches. The reconstructed square is rebranded as the \\"Ipoh Heritage Square\\", serving as the starting point of the Ipoh heritage trail. The square is also prominent for a cenotaph erected in the centre. Unveiled during the 1927 Armistice Day, the stone brick cenotaph was built to honour men from Perak who have died in the Great War. The cenotaph has subsequently been modified with new plaques to honour fallen soldiers from Perak in World War II, the Malayan Emergency, the Indonesian confrontation and the \\"Re-insurgency Period\\". As a result of the cenotaph's location the square has been a long-time local venue for Remembrance Day and Anzac Day. Some earlier plaques have been removed and replaced in an intervening change; the original brass plaque for the Great War dead has been restored although it is reinstalled on a different side of the cenotaph while several decorative brass parts have remained missing; to counter further vandalism the brass plaque has been covered with protective plastic shielding. A more recent addition is a memorial plaque that pays tribute to combatant and non-combatant prisoners of war who died building the Thailand‚ÄìBurma Railway. The cenotaph, along with a matured Ipoh tree planted in 1980, are some of the few elements of the Ipoh Station Square that were preserved during the 2011‚Äî2013 rebuild.  In popular culture  * The 1917 station's exterior and original platform level are illustrated as the backdrops for the final act of Town Boy (1981). * The Ipoh station was used as a shooting location for the film Anna and the King (1999).

Overview Roberto Rocca was born in Milan, in 1922, as the eldest son of Maria Queirazza and Agostino Rocca. The elder Rocca was an engineering apprentice who would later become a member of the board of directors of the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI), the centerpiece of the corporate state advanced by Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.Fundaci√≥n Konex: Roberto Rocca During World War II, Roberto Rocca enlisted in the Italian Navy, serving from June 1942 until September 8, 1943, as a Second Lieutenant in Naval Engineering on board a submarine. He graduated as Mechanical Engineer at the Politecnico di Milano in July 1945, though seven months later, the family left Italy for Buenos Aires, Argentina.Techint The Independent His father's new establishment, Techint, prospered during the administration of populist President Juan Per√≥n, and Rocca enrolled at MIT, earning a degree in science at the end of 1949. Involved in Techint since its initial, 1945 establishment, Rocca served an engineer and in the company's technical department. He was named head of the technical department in 1959, and oversaw the company's expansion into the steel industry. He became General Manager of Techint at the end of 1969, and CEO upon his father's retirement in 1975.Fondazione Dalmine: Agostino Rocca Agostino Rocca died in 1978, leaving his elder son as Chairman and CEO. Techint was, by then, a conglomerate with 15,000 employees, two steel manufacturing facilities in Argentina and with international engineering and construction interests. Buffeted by problems in the Argentine economy during the 1980s, Techint expanded its Latin American activities. Techint participated in the privatization drive adopted by President Carlos Menem in the early 1990s, purchasing a majority stake in Argentina's then-leading steel manufacturer, the state-owned , in 1992. Techint bids for two electric utilities serving the Buenos Aires area came in second, however. Rocca converted Somisa into Siderar, and integrated Techint's cold rolled steel operations (for which Somisa had long been a leading supplier, reportedly at a loss to the state concern) into Siderca. Between 1992 and 1996 Siderar raised its share of domestic consumption of flat steel (used in major appliances and the auto industry, among others) from about 56 percent to about 79 percent.Funding Universe: Siderar Relinquishing the presidency of Techint to his elder son, Agostino, in 1993, he became president of Siderca in 1996, as well as of Dalmine, a steelmaker based in Bergamo, Italy, acquired in 1996. Rocca embarked on a five-year investment program for Siderar, modernizing operations and shedding unprofitable units. Productivity almost tripled during this period, and costs per ton fell by 28 percent. Siderar was listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange in 1996. A further joint venture was entered into with Tamsa, in Mexico, and a controlling stake was purchased in Sidor (the leading steelmaker in Venezuela) in 1998, Confab (Brazil), in 1999, and in NKK (Japan), in 2000, making it the first Japanese steel company in foreign majority ownership.NKK press release (August 1, 2000) In 1998, Konex Foundation from Argentina, granted him the Diamond Konex Award for Institutions-Community-Enterprizes as the most important businessman in the last decade in his country. The family was shaken by the April 28, 2001, aviation death of Agostino Rocca, president of Techint and Roberto Rocca's successor.Ragni di Lecco: Agostino Rocca Agostino's younger brother, Paolo Rocca, was appointed to the post. Subsequently, Siderca was listed on the NYSE, and Techint's steel operations, the group's centerpiece, were reorganized as Tenaris in October 2002, basing the subsidiary in Luxembourg and converting Techint into a holding company.Tenaris:About us A patron of the arts and philanthropist, Rocca served as Vice President of the Mozarteum Argentino, Honorary President of the C√≠rculo Italiano and Honorary Member of the Institute for Industrial Development (IDI), all prominent non-profit organizations in Argentina. He was elected the first chairman of Tenaris, but died in his native Milan, on June 10, 2003, at the age of 81. Growing alongside the Argentine economic recovery that followed, Siderca's steel tube shipments grew from 2.5 million tons in 2003 to 4.5 million in 2008.

Life and work B√∂ttger was born in Aschersleben, Germany in 1806. After attending the primary school there he joined the school of the Franksche Stiftung in Halle an der Saale at the age of eleven. In 1824, B√∂ttger started to study theology, but in parallel also attended the science lectures at the University Halle. The lectures of Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger had a strong influence on him. B√∂ttger left the university in 1828 and worked as cleric and teacher at different locations. The contact with Schweigger never faded and in 1831 B√∂ttger decided to leave the theology career. He was offered a job at the voluntary association for chemistry in Frankfurt in 1835. His first major work in Frankfurt was the improvement of the electrotyping method for the production of printing plates. B√∂ttger received his PhD from the University of Jena in 1837 and was appointed as full professor in Frankfurt in 1842. B√∂ttger married Christiane Harpke in 1841, and they had eight children. He and Christian Friedrich Sch√∂nbein, a German-Swiss chemist, discovered nitrocellulose independently in 1846. Both scientists collaborated to earn money with the invention, but they were not successful. The development of the safety match in 1848 and the synthesis of the first organocopper compound, the explosive copper(I) acetylide Cu2C2 in 1859 were examples for his chemistry research. B√∂ttger stayed at the University of Frankfurt am Main for the rest of his life, although he was offered positions at other universities. He died of a liver illness in 1881.

Biography Early life and career Keating was born in Aldershot, England, in 1910 and arrived in New Zealand in 1926 alongside family members. He found employment with the New Zealand Post Office and attended the University of Auckland part-time, eventually graduating with a master of arts majoring in history. He married Marguerita Mary (Rita) Wigg in Dunedin on 29 March 1948 with whom he had four sons and one daughter. He was Vice-President of the New Zealand Post Office Association from 1949 to 1954 and a member of the Post Office Promotion Board from 1950 to 1954. He was a member of the Government Superannuation Board from 1948 to 1953. Political career At the 1953 local-body elections he stood unsuccessfully for the Wellington Harbour Board on the Labour Party ticket. Keating represented the Hastings electorate from 1954 to 1960, when he was defeated by National's Duncan MacIntyre. He attempted to regain the seat in 1963, but was unsuccessful. Keating was thought of as a potential cabinet member at the formation of the Second Labour Government. The press thought him the most qualified member of the Labour caucus for the position of Postmaster-General due to his work experience prior to entering Parliament. However he was not selected for cabinet and remained a backbencher. For the duration of the government Keating defended the government's record and countered attacks from the opposition regarding taxation levels. He particularly highlighted the success of the introduction of the Pay-as-you-earn tax (PAYE) as an improvement to the tax system in place prior to Labour taking office. He was a member of the Labour Party's national executive from 1957 to 1960 and chairman of the Wellington Labour Party Division from 1968 to 1975. In 1969 Keating stood for the vice-presidency of the Labour Party. He gained minimal support with only 2 delegates voting for him in the ballot. Later career After politics he became a tutor and senior lecturer in industrial relations at Victoria University of Wellington. Keating also served as a director of the Bank of New Zealand from 1975 to 1987. He had previously been a member of the bank's housing allocation committee from 1947 to 1960. In the 1986 Queen's Birthday Honours, Keating was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, for public and community services. Death He died in 1987 in Wellington after a lengthy illness. He was survived by his wife, five children and three grandchildren.

The station was officiated by Sir Hugh Low.Malayan Railways 100 years 1885 - 1995 The station was the eastern terminus of the Taiping-Port Weld Railway Line, Malaysia's first railway line. The tracks of the line no longer exist as they were dismantled in the 1980s. The second station, which replaced the original Taiping railway station, was the relocated to the Jalan Stesen site between the 1890s to early 1900s. This station was in operation until it was replaced by a new station that was built as part of the Ipoh-Padang Besar Electrification and Double-Tracking Project. The old station is still standing and is being preserved. The new station, which is situated to the northeast of the second station, began operations on 27 February 2014. The KTM ETS's ETS Transit began serving this station when services commenced on 10 July 2015. A day later on 11 July 2015, ETS Ekspres trains began serving this station.

The station is served by the KTM ETS and the KTM Komuter Northern Sector trains. It previously served as the southern end of the International Express from Bangkok, Thailand, which now ends at Padang Besar. The station is located near to, and linked via covered pedestrian walkways, the Penang Sentral and the Sultan Abdul Hamid Ferry Terminal for ferries to Penang Island. The end of the line at this station is \\"Chainage Zero\\", and as such, regarded as the starting point of the KTM West Coast Line and also the line to Padang Besar, which is connected to the State Railway of Thailand network. All distances for the two lines are measured from the end of the line here. History The station began operations in 1967 when the railway swing bridge over the Perai River was opened, allowing the rail line which had prior to this terminated at Perai (also known as Prai and Prye), to continue to Butterworth. Before the railway line was extended to Butterworth, all rail services began from Perai, where ferries to Penang Island also departed. The railway line between Prai and Bukit Mertajam was opened in July 1899, and as sections of the West Coast Line were completed, allowed trains to run from Prai to Seremban by 1903, and Johor Bahru by 1909. The line to Padang Besar was completed in 1918, allowing the first International Express to run between Prai and Bangkok's Thonburi Station that year. New station On 5 August 2011, the old Butterworth station building was officially closed and subsequently demolished. It was replaced with a temporary station located about 30m away, next to the KTM Bhd (KTMB) parcel office. A new Butterworth railway station was then built as part of the Electric Double Tracking Project. North Butterworth Container Terminal The Butterworth station is also connected to a freight terminal known as the North Butterworth Container Terminal (NBCT) to handle freight cargo from the south at Johor and from the north at Thailand (via Padang Besar railway station). Until 1 July 2011, the container terminal also sent shipments and received emptied freight rolling stock to and from Kampong Bahru railyard in Singapore near Tanjong Pagar railway station.

Daly and Thomas Lodge, British Medical Journal (International Edition), 22 March 1997, Vol. 314 Issue 7084, p906 Stuart-Harris was born in 1909 in Kings Norton, the son of a Birmingham general practitioner Charles Herbert Harris and his wife, Helen Parsons. In 1935, he received a ¬£55 a year fellowship from the bequest of Sir Henry Royce (of Rolls-Royce) to conduct research at the National Institute for Medical Research into the cause and cure of influenza. The following year he went to the United States on a Rockefeller scholarship. In World War II he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps in Europe and the Far East, commanding field laboratories, ending with the rank of colonel and showing an early acumen in the diagnosis of infective diseases. He himself contracted some of those diseases he studied, notably typhus and typhoid. When he was appointed to the chair at Sheffield in 1946 the shortlist included George White Pickering and Robert Platt who respectively became regius professor of medicine and master of Pembroke College at Oxford and professor of medicine at Manchester and president of the Royal College of Physicians. At Sheffield, Stuart-Harris carried out research into poliomyelitis and influenza viruses (the oral polio vaccine underwent its first trials at Sheffield) and set up a major research and epidemiological unit to investigate respiratory illnesses. He identified the difference between influenza and the common cold, showing that several strains of influenza virus existed and that vaccination against one was not necessarily proof against another. He was honoured with a C.B.E. in 1961 and a knighthood in 1970.Postgraduate Medical Journal, February 1979, pp. 71-72 After retirement he served as postgraduate dean for five years and adviser to the new Chinese medical school in Hong Kong.

The facilities for each country operate from separate counters inside the railway station building at the platform level. After disembarking from a train, rail passengers are processed for exiting or entering both countries by walking from one counter to the other before boarding trains travelling into the relevant countries. There are currently no trains going across the Malaysia-Thailand border with the State Railway of Thailand's International Express no longer serving Butterworth, Malaysia and the termination of Keretapi Tanah Melayu's Senandung Langkawi and later, Ekspres Semenanjung service to Hat Yai. All Malaysian and Thai trains now terminate at this station and as such, passengers would already have completed their CIQ procedures before boarding their trains. Previously for the International Express and KTM's express service to Hat Yai, passengers would have to disembark, go through the CIQ procedures from both countries inside the station before reboarding the train for their onward journey. Trains would wait for all passengers to be processed before departing.

He is best known today for his woodcut prints and for the decorative works on the Torshov Church in Oslo. Background Tidemand-Johannessen received his artistic education at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry 1935‚Äì37 under Per Krohg, and made his debut at H√∏stutstillingen in Oslo in 1936. Tidemand- Johannessen then began studies at the Berlin University of the Arts, but was expelled by the Nazi management of the academy after three weeks for allegedly being a \\"Degenerate artist\\". After that, he participated in an illegal, underground academy in Berlin for about a year, and made study trips to Austria and Hungary.Tidemand-Johannessen p. 42, √òstby p. 265, Norsk kunstnerleksikon p. 261 During World War II, Tidemand-Johannessen participated in the defense of Norway in 1940, and then in the Norwegian resistance to the German occupation.Tidemand-Johannessen p. 42, Norsk kunstnerleksikon p. 261 He was arrested in February 1941 by the Nazi authorities. For a year and a half, between February 1941 and July 1942, he was being moved between the prisons in √Ökebergveien and M√∏llergaten 19. Then, from 9 July 1943 onwards he was imprisoned at Grini concentration camp. Tidemand-Johannessen was editor-in- chief of the magazine Avant-garden, which was published by the Young Communist League of Norway until the liberation from German occupation in 1945. He continued in this position when the magazine became legal after the war. In the late 1940s he also served as a culture journalist/writer for Friheten, the party's daily newspaper.√òstby p. 265, Norsk kunstnerleksikon p. 261, Flor p. 18, Tidemand Johannessen p. 42 After the war Tidemand-Johannessen taught for a while at the National Academy of Craft and Art Industry, and played a central role in the idealist-communist circles at the academy up until the Furubotn Purge within the Communist Party of Norway in 1949.Egeland p. 19 In his time Tidemand-Johannessen became well known, and to some degree controversial, because of his radical ideas about art. In an interview in the Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang in 1953, he argued for erasing the line separating art from the crafts. Tidemand-Johannessen himself printed large, unnumbered editions of woodcuts on a manual book printing press, made possible by innovative techniques involving heat and pressure applied to the specially prepared wood panels. As a result, he could produce graphic art of high technical quality at prices most people could afford.Barlaup 12 December 1953 Tidemand-Johannessen married Blanche Aanesen and had two children, of whom the son Kjeld Tidemand- Johannessen also became an artist.  Graphic Art  Tidemand-Johannessen produced most of his graphic art during the years 1946‚Äì1958. Much of this work is in the medium of woodcut prints. He is considered to be part of the Norwegian color-woodcut school, along with others like Paul Ren√© Gauguin.Rude p. 28, Flor p. 16, Norsk kunstnerleksikon p. 261, Helliesen p. 170 Tidemand- Johannessen was known for his experimental approach to both process and expression, and his own visual vocabulary evolved to a large extent during his relatively few years as a practicing print-maker. While his early work has been described as lyrical, his later work is far more stylized and formal.Norsk kunstnerleksikon p. 261, Stenstadvold 10 October 1958 The woodcut To kvinner from 1954 is an example of his later work. It is part of Storebrand's art collection. The series Norway in 12 Original Color Woodcuts was, in the Norwegian version, published in a large edition by the publishing house Yngvil Forlag in the fall of 1953 and was presented as mass-produced book illustrations, with printed signatures. The series deals with subjects drawn from the country's National Romanticist movement of the nineteenth century, by way of images from different and contrasting regions of Norway, in a rejuvenated design idiom and with specific themes associated with each month of the year. The series was also published in an English version, distributed by Johan Grundt Tanum Bokhandel.  Exhibitions  Before the war, Tidemand- Johannessen participated in H√∏stutstillingen in Oslo in 1936, 1937 and 1939. From 1946 he had several solo exhibitions, and was represented in many group shows ‚Äì in Norway, Europe and Brazil. After his death in 1958 there was a memorial exhibition of his work in Galleri Per in Oslo, where he had shown at several occasions since 1947.Norsk kunstnerleksikon p. 261 In more recent years, Tidemand-Johannessen has been represented in two group retrospectives: Den norske tresnittskolen (The Norwegian Woodcut School) at the National Gallery of Norway in Oslo from 23 August ‚Äì 26 October 1997, and Europeisk fargegrafikk fra Ateneums samlinger (European Color Prints from the Ateneum's Collection), Ateneum, Helsinki, from 1 October 2005 ‚Äì 26 March 2006.  Collections  Tidemand-Johannessen is represented in the collections of the National Gallery of Norway, with eight prints, as well as in several other Norwegian galleries, both public and private. Outside of Norway, he is represented in the Statens Museum for Kunst, K√∏benhavn; Nationalmuseum, Stockholm; Ateneum, Helsinki; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam; Victoria and Albert Museum, London; Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow; Metropolitan Museum, New York.  Torshov Church  Tidemand-Johannessen collaborated with the architect Ulf Nyquist and designed the decorative elements for Torshov Church (Torshov kirke) in Oslo. The church was inaugurated on Whitsunday in 1958, and is considered to be the first modern church building of its kind in Norway. These decorative elements mainly consist of stained-glass windows, glass mosaics and decorative iron-work. At his death, Tidemand-Johannessen had completed three of the twelve stained-glass windows. The remainder were completed by Jardar Lunde (1909-1990). The decorative iron-work was executed by the master smith Fred Becker after Tidemand-Johannessen's designs.  Design  Tidemand-Johannessen built, prepared and carved the original wood panels for printing bookbinding designs for a number of books for several publishing houses in Oslo. He explored other techniques as well, like embedding molten metal in wood objects. In the fall of 1956 Tidemand- Johannessen exhibited a group of work in intarsia at Norway Design in Oslo. These were produced in collaboration with Asta Musedalslien at Norsk Intarsia AS in Tyristrand, after designs by Tidemand-Johannessen. This exhibition received a favorable review from Bonytt, an established Norwegian magazine of arts and interior design.Refsum pp. 62‚Äì63 In the 1950s, Tidemand-Johannessen designed a table-service for Stavangerflint, produced in a limited commemorative edition for Norges Kooperative Landsforening.  Writings  In the first years after the war, Tidemand-Johannessen wrote a short-story collection and two novels, published by Gyldendal Norsk Forlag: Vi syntes ikke det hastet (1945); Prolog over en avd√∏d kj√¶rlighet. Noveller (1946) and Utenfor slentrer folk forbi (1948).

Ron Hubbard's discussion of abortion in his 1950 book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. Hubbard wrote in Dianetics that abortion and attempts at abortion could cause trauma to the fetus and to the mother in both spiritual and physical ways. Scientologists came to believe that attempted abortions could cause traumatic experiences felt by the fetus, which would later be remembered as memories referred to in Scientology as \\"engrams\\". In the Scientology technique called Auditing, Scientologists are frequently queried regarding their sexual feelings and behaviors. These questions about Scientologists' sexual behavior are often posed to members during \\"security checks\\", a specific form of auditing sessions where individuals are required to document their divergence from the organization's ethics. One of the questions asked in these security checks is, \\"Have you ever been involved in an abortion?\\". A female former member of Scientology's elite organization called the Sea Org discussed the views of Scientology concerning abortion with sociologist Stephen A. Kent. She told Kent that while the Sea Org operated at sea during the mid-1970s, women understood that they were not to have children. She stated to Kent that women on the ships were pressured into having abortions. In 1994, former Scientologist and Sea Org member Mary Tabayoyon filed a legal declaration in which she said that while at Scientology's base in Hemet, California members of the Sea Org were instructed not to have children, and were coerced to have abortions. In 1999, former Scientologist Jesse Prince told The Press- Enterprise that after his wife Monika became pregnant while both were working at the Scientology complex Golden Era Productions in Gilman Hot Springs, California, she was ordered to have an abortion in order for the couple to remain in the Sea Org. Scientology representatives at the time asserted that Prince's wife chose of her own volition to have an abortion, and was not forced to do so. In 2001, former Scientologist Astra Woodcraft told the San Francisco Chronicle that if a woman gets pregnant while in the Sea Org, she will either be sent to a lower-level organization of Scientology, or be pressured to have an abortion. In April 2008, Woodcraft appeared along with Scientology leader David Miscavige's niece Jenna Miscavige Hill on the ABC News program Nightline, and both asserted that Sea Org members who become pregnant are told to either leave or get an abortion. Claire Headley was an employee at Scientology's facility Golden Era Productions from 1991 to 2005 and a Scientologist and Sea Org member. In 2009, she filed a lawsuit against Golden Era Productions in which she asserted she was forced to undergo two abortions in order to keep her position with her employer. Scientology representative Tommy Davis described her lawsuit as \\"utterly meritless\\", and said that Scientologists who sign up for the Sea Org know that they are \\"becoming a part of a highly dedicated, highly disciplined, very regulated lifestyle as part of a religious order\\". Laura Ann DeCrescenzo filed a lawsuit in 2009 against Scientology, in which she asserted that she was forced to have an abortion at age 17. In commentary on Scientology and practices in the Sea Org, new religious movements scholar J. Gordon Melton told the San Francisco Chronicle that members of the Sea Org are discouraged from having children. Melton wrote in a contribution in the book New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America that he had yet to see documents confirming whether Scientology had a policy demanding that pregnant members of the Sea Org get an abortion. In an article for the Marburg Journal of Religion, sociologist Stephen A. Kent wrote that \\"researchers should not be surprised to learn of pressures that Sea Org women felt to either abort pregnancies or give-up children for adoption\\". Kent commented, \\"Sea Org obligations override many personal and family obligations and responsibilities, and devotion to the Scientology cause often appears to take priority over the needs of children.\\" L. Ron Hubbard's views Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard wrote in Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health that abortion and attempts at abortion could cause trauma to the fetus and to the mother in both spiritual and physical ways. The St. Petersburg Times reported on how Hubbard's views from Dianetics affect Scientology practitioners, \\"Abortion is therefore rare among Scientologists, recognizing that even the fetus may have already been occupied by a spiritual being. In some instances, abortion might be chosen of health concerns of the mother or other personal factors.\\" Hubbard asserted, \\"It is a scientific fact that abortion attempts are the most important factor in aberration\\", and stated \\"Attempted abortion is very common. ... Twenty or thirty abortion attempts are not uncommon in the aberree.\\" He believed that attempted abortions led to ulcers. Hubbard wrote in Dianetics, \\"The child on whom the abortion is attempted is condemned to live with murderers whom he reactively knows to be murderers through all this weak and helpless youth!\\". He asserted: In a 1950 article in Look magazine, Albert Q. Maisel wrote, \\"Unlike many religious groups, the proponents of dianetics have nothing against birth control. But the greatest of all crimes and the root of most evils, as they see it, is the attempt - or even just the verbal wish - to cause the abortion of a child already conceived. They object here, not so much on moral grounds, as because such attempts - or such wishes and thoughts - load down the time track with the basic-basic demon engram.\\" In his 1951 book Science of Survival, Hubbard wrote that a mother who reached a status of 1.1 (\\"Covert hostility\\") on the \\"tone scale\\" listed in the book would \\"attempt the abortion of her child\\", and that any woman who attempted an abortion would occupy this level or below. Such a woman, he wrote, \\"can be expected to be unreliable, inconstant and promiscuous; and the child is looked upon as evidence of this promiscuity.\\" According to The World's Religions: The Study of Religion, Traditional and New Religion, \\"early Dianetics enthusiasts believed that attempted abortion of the fetus by its mother caused \\"traumatic experiences in intra-uterine life\\". Stephen J. Hunt noted in Alternative Religions that Scientologists believe certain events in one's life may trigger a memory referred to in Scientology as an \\"engram\\". Hunt wrote, \\"The engram may be triggered by association of events and objects. Although the conscious mind will eventually forget an incident, the reactive mind stores every detail. According to Hubbard, some of the most powerful engrams are constructed while still in the womb. The unborn child hears the angry words of parents caught up in marital disputes or perhaps talk of abortion. Scientology practice Auditing In the Scientology technique called Auditing, Scientologists are frequently queried regarding their sexual feelings and behaviors. These questions about Scientologists' sexual behavior are often posed to members during \\"security checks\\", a specific form of auditing sessions where individuals are required to document their divergence from the organization's ethics. Scientologists on the spiritual pathway known as \\"The Bridge to Total Freedom\\" are given security checks, and those of the level called Operating Thetan receive these checks once every six months. Scientology officials explained that the security checks are given \\"to make sure they're using the tech correctly\\". Among the sexual questions asked in the Scientology security checks include, \\"Have you ever practiced sex with animals?\\", \\"Have you ever practiced sodomy?\\", \\"Have you ever slept with a member of a race of another color?\\", and \\"Have you ever been involved in an abortion?\\". Sea Org In a 1987 interview with sociologist Stephen A. Kent, a former member of Scientology's elite organization called the Sea Org discussed the views of Scientology with regard to abortion in the 1970s. During the mid-1970s, the Sea Org operated on vessels at sea. Women understood that it was not permitted to raise children on board the ships. According to woman interviewed by Kent, these women on board the Sea Org ships were pressured to undergo abortions. \\"On the ship, I know of a lot of people that had abortions, because they didn't want to leave the ship. It wasn't like anybody said 'You have got to get an abortion.' It was more an implied thing. If you don't you're going to leave,\\" said the woman to Kent. According to Brian Kelly, editor in chief of From the Housestops journal, Sea Org members were shown unpublished writings by L. Ron Hubbard in order to assure them that having an abortion was not against Scientology practices. \\"To convince members that its OK to have an abortion, when the organization was supposedly anti- abortion, pregnant Sea Orgers were shown unpublished writings of Hubbard where he taught that babies didn‚Äôt receive their own spirit until birth,\\" wrote Kelly. Mary Tabayoyon joined Scientology in 1967 and became a member of the Sea Org in 1971, later leaving Scientology in 1992. Tabayoyon filed a legal declaration on August 26, 1994 in the case Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz, describing Scientology's practices on having children in the Sea Org. Tabayoyon wrote that a Sea Org order issued September 26, 1986 stated that having children while in the elite division of Scientology was forbidden. She said that while at Scientology's base in Hemet, California, \\"members of the Sea Org were forbidden to have any more children if they were to stay on post[,] and the Hubbard technology was applied to coercively persuade us to have abortions so that we could remain on post\\". According to Tabayoyon this pressure was exerted during a Scientology procedure known as \\"ethics handling\\", where individuals were instructed to go along with L. Ron Hubbard's policies as well as those of Scientology. Tabayoyon said \\"[I] gave up my child due to my greatly misguided obligation and dedication to the Sea Org\\". She stated she made the decision to give up her child because she was \\"indoctrinated to believe that I should never put my own personal desires ahead of the accomplishment of the purpose of the Sea Org\\". In 1999, former Scientologist Jesse Prince told The Press-Enterprise that after his wife Monika became pregnant while both were working at the Scientology complex Golden Era Productions in Gilman Hot Springs, California, she was ordered to have an abortion in order for the couple to remain in the Sea Org. \\"The order devastated both my wife and me. Our dedication as Sea Org members clashed violently with our intentions as parents and we went through a personal nightmare,\\" said Prince in an affidavit filed in a legal case in Colorado. Scientology representatives at the time asserted that Prince's wife chose of her own volition to have an abortion, and was not forced to do so. Prince said that his wife was never the same after her abortion, and decided she wanted to leave Scientology. The couple left Scientology in 1992. Golden Era Productions general manager Ken Hoden told The Press-Enterprise that per Scientology policy, employees are not allowed to work at the Gilman Hot Springs facility if they have children under six years of age because the difficult work schedule would not permit the parents to spend sufficient time with their children. \\"We don't think it's right for parents to spend time away from their kids. Every person that says they have been coerced are saying it for another reason. Nobody is coerced into doing anything in the Church of Scientology. The purpose of Scientology is to increase a person's self- determinism,\\" said Hoden. The director of public affairs for the Church of Scientology International, Aron Mason, said Prince's statements were motivated by financial reasons, and stated to The Press-Enterprise, \\"He is only existing because he gets paid to say the party line for people who are anti- Scientologists.\\" Betty Hardin, a former worker in the finance department at Golden Era Productions, has described routinely driving pregnant women to the Planned Parenthood center in Riverside, California to obtain abortions and follow-up treatment. According to Hardin, she eventually got out of being the driver for the \\"abortion run\\" because the anti-abortion activists who often picketed the Planned Parenthood center saw her so often that they came to recognize her. Tera Hathaway filed an affidavit in 2001 which stated, \\"[The Executive Director] had gone on to say that at this point in my life it is better to do the greatest good for all. That spending my life ‚Äòclearing the planet‚Äô which means basically to get the planet saved from insanity, would be the greatest good, in other words, a far more noble endeavor than leaving staff to raise a child. She went on to tell me that the spirit doesn't enter the baby's body until the baby is born. She made the point that all I would be ‚Äòkilling‚Äô is a piece of meat essentially. We discussed this for a couple of days and she showed me definitions in the L. Ron Hubbard Technical Dictionary to persuade me to have an abortion.\\" A protester holds a sign which reads: \\"C[hurch] o[f] S[cientology] forces its female members to get abortions\\" (February 10, 2008) In 2001, former Scientologist Astra Woodcraft told the San Francisco Chronicle that she decided to attempt to get pregnant because she thought this would help her get out of Scientology, due to its practices with regard to abortion. \\"If you get pregnant, they'll send you to one of their smaller, lower-level organizations. In reality, you're very heavily pressured to get an abortion , but I figured it was my only way to get out,\\" said Woodcraft. A bio page on a website Woodcraft created in 2008 said she \\"left Scientology for good when the church tried to pressure her to have an abortion\\". Scientology leaders told the San Francisco Chronicle that the organization does not have a policy on abortion, but instead leaves the decision up to the individual. In 2003, The Times of India reported that \\"Forced abortions, beatings, starvation are considered tools of discipline in this church.\\" In 2005, a former high-ranking member of the Sea Org told the New York Post, \\"It is estimated that there have been some 1,500 abortions carried out by women in the Sea Organization since the implementation of a rule in the late '80s that members could not remain in the organization if they decided to have children. And if members who have been in the Sea Organization for, say, 10 years do decide to have kids, they are dismissed with no more than $1,000\\" as a severance package. Former Scientologist and Sea Org member Karen Pressley recounted to Andrew Morton in the 2008 book Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography that she was often asked by fellow Scientologists for loans so that they could get an abortion and remain in the Sea Org. \\"I had a real problem because I don't believe in abortion,\\" said Pressley. She repeated the allegation in a book she wrote, detailing her escape from Scientology. Morton wrote that \\"Scientology officials reject as 'simply false' the assertion that Sea Org women are encouraged, as a matter of policy, to have abortions.\\" In April 2008, Astra Woodcraft appeared on the ABC News program Nightline along with Jenna Miscavige Hill, the niece of Scientology leader David Miscavige. Astra Woodcraft said that when she was about 17 years old, Scientology came up with a policy that Sea Org members could not have children. \\"If you get pregnant when you're in the Sea Org, you either have to leave or you get an abortion. I know people who have gotten like up to four abortions,\\" said Hill. Astra's father Lawrence Woodcraft told Nightline, \\"She was very upset when she was about 16 or 17 and told me they suddenly decided to change the rules and Sea Org members were no longer allowed to have children.\\" Two years later, Astra became pregnant, and she said that she was asked about this by a high-ranking member of the Sea Org, \\"A very high-level Sea Org member one day saw me and asked me what I was doing and I said I was leaving and I said I was pregnant and he said, 'Oh, is it too late for an abortion?' I didn't even know what to say in response.\\" Former Scientologist and actor Jason Beghe and former Scientologist and Sea Org member Marc Headley commented on issues of Scientology and abortion in September 2008 at a conference in Hamburg, Germany sponsored by Germany‚Äôs Department of Interior Affairs. \\"It is against the codes of Sea Org to have children. If a female staff member for some reason was married, and got pregnant, then she's basically forced or convinced to have an abortion. If she refuses to have an abortion, then she will be offloaded from the Sea Organization and in most cases, declared; and she will not be able to speak to any of her family or friends that are Scientologists,\\" said Headley. In 2009, husband and wife Marc and Claire Headley filed lawsuits against Scientology's Golden Era Productions, asserting the organization participated in human trafficking and violated United States labor law on the state and federal level. Claire Headley was an employee at Golden Era Productions from 1991 to 2005, and stated in the lawsuit that she worked \\"long, hard hours for illegal wages, was forced to have (two) abortions to keep her job and was subjected to violations of personal rights and liberties for the purpose of obtaining forced labor.\\" Scientology representative Tommy Davis described the Headleys' lawsuits as \\"utterly meritless\\" in a statement to The Press-Enterprise. Davis said that \\"As members of the religious order called the Sea Organization, we have dedicated our lives to the service of the Scientology religion.\\" He told The Press-Enterprise, \\"Here's the thing that's so disingenuous about (the lawsuits). When you join the Sea Organization, you know you are voluntarily signing up and becoming a part of a highly dedicated, highly disciplined, very regulated lifestyle as part of a religious order. It's tough. It's not meant to be easy.\\" Laura Ann DeCrescenzo filed a lawsuit in 2009 against Scientology, in which she asserted the organization had engaged in \\"human trafficking, obstructing justice, employment violations, discrimination and violation of privacy\\". \\"There are two very different versions of Scientology. There is the Scientology as presented to the outside world and there is a different Scientology in which plaintiff lived and worked for approximately 13 years. In the Scientology world plaintiff experienced, 12-year-old children are taken from their homes, asked to sign employment contracts and put to work. Pregnant women are coerced to have abortions,\\" wrote DeCrescenzo in her complaint. She asserted in the complaint that while in Scientology she was \\"coerced to have an abortion\\". The complaint stated, \\"At age 12, plaintiff signed her first 'Contract of Employment.' She left school, home and family to work for the Church of Scientology International. This required that plaintiff move to another state. She was married to a co-worker at age 16, became pregnant while still a minor and was coerced by CSI to have an abortion at age 17.\\" In March 2009, investigative journalist Nathan Baca of KESQ-TV interviewed former Scientologist Maureen Bolstad. Bolstad said that women who worked at Scientology's headquarters were forced to have abortions, or faced being declared a \\"Suppressive Person\\" by the organization's management. Bolstand told Baca, \\"If a woman gets pregnant, and does not abort the child, then they are declared a suppressive person. Because, it kind of started out gradually. At first, the thing was, the Church of Scientology International did not want to pay for child care.\\" L. Ron Hubbard stated those declared suppressive persons, \\"cannot be granted the rights ordinarily accorded rational beings\\". As part of their protest movement against Scientology, in June 2009 the group Anonymous released a statement highlighting what it referred to as \\"abuses in the Sea Org\\", including \\"Child labor, coerced abortions, harsh working conditions, human trafficking, cruel punishment, disconnection of families\\", and asserted a \\"Cadet Org\\" for children within the Sea Org \\"was disbanded as unnecessary when abortions were made mandatory for Sea Org women.\\" Australian politician Nick Xenophon, an independent member of the Australian Senate, gave a speech to the Australian Parliament in November 2009, about statements he had received from former Scientologists. He said that he had been told members of the organization had coerced pregnant female employees to have abortions. \\"I am deeply concerned about this organisation and the devastating impact it can have on its followers,\\" said Senator Xenophon, and he requested that the Australian Senate begin an investigation into Scientology. According to the letters presented by Senator Xenophon, the organization was involved in \\"ordering\\" its members to have abortions. Former Scientologist Aaron Saxton sent a letter to Senator Xenophon stating he had participated in coercing pregnant women within the organization to have abortions. \\"Aaron says women who fell pregnant were taken to offices and bullied to have an abortion. If they refused, they faced demotion and hard labour. Aaron says one staff member used a coat hanger and self-aborted her child for fear of punishment,\\" said Senator Xenophon. Carmel Underwood, another former Scientologist, said she had been put under \\"extreme pressure\\" to have an abortion, and that she was placed into a \\"disappearing programme\\", after refusing. Underwood was the executive director of Scientology's branch in Sydney, Australia. Former Scientologists Anna and Dean Detheridge of Sydney had been Scientology staffers for 17 years, and according to Senator Xenophon they had been \\"subjected to physical and mental abuse during their time with the organisation\\". The Senator said that, \\"Anna and Dean also provided evidence where information they and others have revealed to the church have been used to blackmail and control. They also provided more information about coerced abortions.\\" Mike Ferriss, the head of Scientology in New Zealand, denied the claims of forced abortions, saying to 3 News \\"There are no forced abortions in Scientology and if Aaron Saxton or anyone else coerced someone into having an abortion then they are way outside of the Church's policy and ethical conduct. We respect human life and the rights of mother's and families in such matters. The Church does not intervene.\\" In March 2010, former Scientologist Janette Lang stated that at age 20 she became pregnant by her boyfriend while in the organization, and her boyfriend's Scientology supervisors \\"coerced them into terminating the pregnancy\\". \\"We fought for a week, I was devastated, I felt abused, I was lost and eventually I gave in. It was my baby, my body and my choice, and all of that was taken away from me by Scientology,\\" said Lang. Lang explained why she chose this time to come forward, \\"I'm speaking out today because the time has come for victims of Scientology to be heard.\\" Scientology spokesperson Virginia Stewart rejected the statements made by Janette Lang, and asserted, \\"The Church of Scientology considers the family unit and children to be of the utmost importance and does not condone nor force anyone to undertake any medical procedure whatsoever.\\" Commentary In his book A Piece of Blue Sky, author Jon Atack commented, \\"A rather peculiar aspect of Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health was Hubbard's emphasis on 'attempted abortions.'\\" Atack pointed out that Hubbard thought attempted abortions caused ulcers, and noted, \\"He had been suffering from a duodenal ulcer since 1943. Author George Malko wrote in Scientology: The Now Religion that \\"Hubbard's extensive discussion of things sexual, his concern with abortions, beatings, coitus under duress, flatulence which causes pressure on the foetus, certain cloacal references, all suggest to me a fascination which borders on the obsessive, as if he possessed a deep-seated hatred of women. All of them are being beaten, most of them prove to be unfaithful, few babies are wanted.\\" Hubbard's interest in abortions was criticized in the 1965 Anderson Report as \\"a morbid preoccupation with matters relating to abnormal behaviour of women\\" and \\"a prurient and distinctly unhealthy attachment to abortions, rape, perversion, and similar matters.\\" New religions scholar J. Gordon Melton told the San Francisco Chronicle that Scientology discourages members of the Sea Org from having children. \\"They don't look at children as a resource, but as a problem. Children take people off-line, so they discourage members of the Sea Org from having children,\\" said Melton. In the book New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America, Melton contributed a chapter, \\"A Contemporary Ordered Religious Community: The Sea Organization\\". In the piece, Melton commented on statements he had seen about Scientology and abortion in \\"anti-Scientology literature\\". Melton wrote, \\"It has been asserted in some anti-Scientology literature that the Church had, at least for a time period, demanded that any female Sea Org members who became pregnant obtain an abortion. I have been unable to find any verification of that allegation.\\" Melton went on to assert, \\"Given the nature of the church, were this ever to have become a policy of the Sea Org, there would have undoutedly been a paper trail of documents which, if they existed, have never been produced.\\" In an article in the Marburg Journal of Religion, Stephen A. Kent discussed Scientology and abortion, writing \\"Because the attitude among some Sea Org leadership appears to be that children hinder adults from performing their vital assignments, researchers should not be surprised to learn of pressures that Sea Org women felt to either abort pregnancies or give-up children for adoption.\\" He commented, \\"Taken together, the interviews, legal declarations, media accounts, and internal documents present troubling glimpses into the lives of Scientology's most committed members. Sea Org obligations override many personal and family obligations and responsibilities, and devotion to the Scientology cause often appears to take priority over the needs of children.\\" In a 1998 speech, attorney and Scientology critic Graham E. Berry commented on Mary Tabayoyan's affidavit about Scientology and abortion, \\"Mary Tabayoyan has testified as to how she and other Scientologists were ordered to have abortions; and I have argued before a court that that constitutes instructions to commit murder. At the very least, it denies a woman freedom of choice with regard to abortion. And why does Scientology do this? Because children require \\"Family Time\\" and \\"Family Time\\" interferes with production; the production of things that produce money.\\" In a May 2009 speech before the cult monitoring organization FECRIS, Berry cited \\"forced abortions\\" among what he referred to as \\"Scientology‚Äôs many secular abuses and crimes\\". In a 2009 article in Catholic Online, associate editor and former Archbishop of the Charismatic Episcopal Church, Randy Sly, pointed out what he saw as a contradiction between Scientology's stated pro-life stance on abortion, with its reported practices. \\"Those who were pregnant were counseled to seek abortions, even though Scientology publicly affirmed a pro-life position,\\" wrote Sly.

The project is a part of the Institutional Critique mouvement, but also relies on relational art practices. The ideas behind the project were formulated by Anton Koslov Mayr in his essay \\"On Art and Domination\\", Jon Refsdal Moe's \\"Staging Cultural Prosperity\\" and Sueli Rolni's \\"The Geopolitics of Pimping\\". Artout Project was set up as a service company offering as a product artists' time, rather than any material work. Any interested party can hire an artist to spend time with and this in itself constitutes a creative act. The project was conceived as a meditation on the relationship between art collectors and art producers, exploring new territories of intersubjectivity and institutional control.  2009 Bridge Art Fair  In 2009 the Artout Project was invited as a special feature of Bridge Art Fair in New York.

It fell into disuse as with the rest of the portion of the railway line from Sentul to Batu Caves. During the Sentul Raya masterplan by YTL Corporation Berhad, the Kampung Batu station was demolished, and rebuilt for the KTM Komuter Port Klang-Sentul line extension. Upon completion in July 2010, the station was served by the Port Klang Line which ran from Port Klang to Batu Caves. In December 2015, following a change in the services of the KTM Komuter, the portion of the railway line between Sentul and Batu Caves stations including Kampung Batu station was transferred to the Seremban Line, with trains now running between Pulau Sebang/Tampin and Batu Caves stations. The station will be connected to the future MRT Putrajaya Line that is currently being constructed beside the existing KTM station. It is set to be completed and to start operations by July 2021.

Working from the perspective of the client who consumes a product or service, \\"value\\" is any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for. Lean approach makes obvious what adds value by reducing everything else which does not add value.

There are, however, different implementations of this idea that don't necessarily apply all of the principles with equal weight. Two well-known types are \\"Kanban\\" and \\"Last Planner System\\". The term Kanban comes from manufacturing but was adapted for software development by David Anderson when he was working at Microsoft in 2005 and inherited an underperforming maintenance team. Anderson, David. (2010) \\"Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business.\\" The success of the approach in that environment, led Anderson to experiment with Kanban in projects, with similarly positive results. As Anderson publicised his findings through talks and his book , software developers began to experiment with Kanban and it is now one of the most widely used methods for managing agile software development projects. The Last Planner System is used principally in construction and particularly focuses on pull and flow but perhaps more important than those is its emphasis on a collaborative approach in which all trades work together to create a visual representation of the work that needs to be done.

Detail of the tympanum here Islamic influences on Western art refers to the influence of Islamic art, the artistic production in the Islamic world from the 8th to the 19th century, on Christian art. During this period, the frontier between Christendom and the Islamic world varied a lot resulting in some cases in exchanges of populations and of corresponding art practices and techniques. Furthermore, the two civilizations had regular relationships through diplomacy and trade that facilitated cultural exchanges. Islamic art covers a wide variety of media including calligraphy, illustrated manuscripts, textiles, ceramics, metalwork and glass, and refers to the art of Muslim countries in the Near East, Islamic Spain, and Northern Africa, though by no means always Muslim artists or craftsmen. Glass production, for example, remained a Jewish speciality throughout the period, and Christian art, as in Coptic Egypt continued, especially during the earlier centuries, keeping some contacts with Europe. Islamic decorative arts were highly valued imports to Europe throughout the Middle Ages; largely because of unsuspected accidents of survival the majority of surviving examples are those that were in the possession of the church. In the early period, textiles were especially important, used for church vestments, shrouds, hangings and clothing for the elite. Islamic pottery of everyday quality was still preferred to European wares. Because decoration was mostly ornamental, or small hunting scenes and the like, and inscriptions were not understood, Islamic objects did not offend Christian sensibilities. In the early centuries of Islam, the most important points of contact between the Latin West and the Islamic world from an artistic point of view were Southern Italy and Sicily and the Iberian peninsula, which both held significant Muslim populations. Later the Italian maritime republics were important in trading artworks. In the Crusades Islamic art seems to have had relatively little influence even on the Crusader art of the Crusader kingdoms, though it may have stimulated the desire for Islamic imports among Crusaders returning to Europe. Numerous techniques from Islamic art formed the basis of art in the Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture of Norman Sicily, much of which used Muslim artists and craftsmen working in the style of their own tradition. Techniques included inlays in mosaics or metals, ivory carving or porphyry, sculpture of hard stones, and bronze foundries. In Iberia the Mozarabic art and architecture of the Christian population living under Muslim rule remained very Christian in most ways, but showed Islamic influences in other respects; much what was described as this is now called Repoblaci√≥n art and architecture. During the late centuries of the Reconquista Christian craftsmen started using Islamic artistic elements in their buildings, as a result the Mud√©jar style was developed. Middle Ages Map showing the main trade routes of late medieval Europe. Islamic art was widely imported and admired by European elites during the Middle Ages.Hoffman, 324; Mack, Chapter 1, and passim throughout; The Art of the Umayyad Period in Spain (711‚Äì1031), Metropolitan Museum of Art timeline Retrieved April 1, 2011 There was an early formative stage from 600-900 and the development of regional styles from 900 onwards. Early Islamic art used mosaic artists and sculptors trained in the Byzantine and Coptic traditions.. Instead of wall-paintings, Islamic art used painted tiles, from as early as 862-3 (at the Great Mosque of Kairouan in modern Tunisia), which also spread to Europe.. According to John Ruskin, the Doge's Palace in Venice contains \\"three elements in exactly equal proportions ‚Äî the Roman, the Lombard, and Arab. It is the central building of the world. ... the history of Gothic architecture is the history of the refinement and spiritualization of Northern work under its influence\\".The Stones of Venice, chapter 1, paras 25 and 29; discussed pp. 49‚Äì56 here Gold Maraved√≠ issued by Alfonso VIII of Castile in imitation of the Almoravid dinar, 1191. The Arabic text makes Christian professions. Islamic rulers controlled at various points parts of Southern Italy and most of modern Spain and Portugal, as well as the Balkans, all of which retained large Christian populations. The Christian Crusaders equally ruled Islamic populations. Crusader art is mainly a hybrid of Catholic and Byzantine styles, with little Islamic influence, but the Mozarabic art of Christians in Al Andaluz seems to show considerable influence from Islamic art, though the results are little like contemporary Islamic works. Islamic influence can also be traced in the mainstream of Western medieval art, for example in the Romanesque portal at Moissac in southern France, where it shows in both decorative elements, like the scalloped edges to the doorway, the circular decorations on the lintel above, and also in having Christ in Majesty surrounded by musicians, which was to become a common feature of Western heavenly scenes, and probably derives from images of Islamic kings on their diwan..

Decorative arts Hispano-Moresque dish, approx 32cm diameter, with Christian monogram \\"IHS\\", decorated in cobalt blue and gold lustre, Valencia, c.1430-1500. A wide variety of portable objects from various decorative arts were imported from the Islamic world into Europe during the Middle Ages, mostly through Italy, and above all Venice.The subject of Mack's book; see Chapter 1 especially. In many areas European-made goods could not match the quality of Islamic or Byzantine work until near the end of the Middle Ages. Luxury textiles were widely used for clothing and hangings and also, fortunately for art history, also often as shrouds for the burials of important figures, which is how most surviving examples were preserved. In this area Byzantine silk was influenced by Sassanian textiles, and Islamic silk by both, so that is hard to say which culture's textiles had the greatest influence on the Cloth of St Gereon, a large tapestry which is the earliest and most important European imitation of Eastern work. European, especially Italian, cloth gradually caught up with the quality of Eastern imports, and adopted many elements of their designs. Byzantine pottery was not produced in high-quality types, as the Byzantine elite used silver instead. Islam has many hadithic injunctions against eating off precious metal, and so developed many varieties of fine pottery for the elite, often influenced by the Chinese porcelain wares which had the highest status among the Islamic elites themselves ‚Äî the Islamic only produced porcelain in the modern period. Much Islamic pottery was imported into Europe, dishes (\\"bacini\\") even in Islamic Al-Andalus in the 13th century, in Granada and M√°laga, where much of the production was already exported to Christian countries. Many of the potters migrated to the area of Valencia, long reconquered by the Christians, and production here outstripped that of Al-Andaluz. Styles of decoration gradually became more influenced by Europe, and by the 15th century the Italians were also producing lustrewares, sometimes using Islamic shapes like the albarello.Caiger-Smith, Chapters 6 and 7 Metalwork forms like the zoomorphic jugs called aquamanile and the bronze mortar were also introduced from the Islamic world. Mud√©jar art in Spain Mud√©jar art is a style influenced by Islamic art that developed from the 12th century until the 16th century in the Iberia's Christian kingdoms. It is the consequence of the ' between the Muslim, Christian and Jewish populations in medieval Spain. The elaborate decoration typical of Mud√©jar style fed into the development of the later Plateresque style in Spanish architecture, combining with late Gothic and Early Renaissance elements. Pseudo-Kufic ciborium, circa 1200 with rim engraved with Arabic script, Limoges, France, 1215-30. Louvre Museum MRR 98. The Arabic Kufic script was often imitated in the West during the Middle-Ages and the Renaissance, to produce what is known as pseudo-Kufic: \\"Imitations of Arabic in European art are often described as pseudo-Kufic, borrowing the term for an Arabic script that emphasizes straight and angular strokes, and is most commonly used in Islamic architectural decoration\\". Numerous cases of pseudo- Kufic are known in European religious art from around the 10th to the 15th century. Pseudo-Kufic would be used as writing or as decorative elements in textiles, religious halos or frames. Many are visible in the paintings of Giotto. Examples are known of the incorporation of Kufic script such as a 13th French Master Alpais' ciborium at the Louvre Museum. Architecture =Arab-Norman culture in Sicily= Christian buildings such as the Cappella Palatina in Palermo, Sicily, incorporated Islamic elements, probably usually created by local Muslim craftsmen working in their own traditions. The ceiling at the Cappella, with its wooden vault arches and gilded figurines, has close parallels with Islamic buildings in Fez and Fustat, and reflect the Muqarnas (stalactite) technique of emphasizing three-dimensional elements The diaphragm arch, Late Antique in origin, was widely used in Islamic architecture, and may have spread from Spain to France. = \\"Saracen style\\" = The Liwan or Sanctuary of the Mosque of Ibn-Tuloon (1878)Ebers, Georg. \\"Egypt: Descriptive, Historical, and Picturesque.\\" Volume 1. Cassell & Company, Limited: New York, 1878. p 213 Scholars of the 18-19th century, who generally preferred Classical art, disliked what they saw as the \\"disorder\\" of Gothic art and perceived similarities between Gothic and Islamic architecture. They often understated the case that Gothic art fully originated in the Islamic art of the Mosque, to the point of calling it \\"Saracenical\\". William John Hamilton commented on the Seljuks monuments in Konya: \\"The more I saw of this peculiar style, the more I became convinced that the Gothic was derived from it, with a certain mixture of Byzantine (...) the origin of this Gotho-Saracenic style may be traced to the manners and habits of the Saracens\\"William John Hamilton (1842) Researches in Asia Minor, Pontus and Armenia p.206 The 18th-century English historian Thomas Warton summarized: = Pointed arch = The Romanesque exterior of Monreale Cathedral, Sicily, shows the influence of Islamic architecture. The pointed arch originated in the Byzantine and Sassanian empires, where it mostly appears in early churches in Syria. The Byzantine Karamagara Bridge has curved elliptical arches rising to a pointed keystone. The priority of the Byzantines in its use is also evidenced by slightly pointed examples in Sant'Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna, and the Hagia Irene, Constantinople. The pointed arch was subsequently adopted and widely used by Muslim architects, becoming the characteristic arch of Islamic architecture. According to Bony, it has spread from Islamic lands, possibly through Sicily, then under Islamic rule, and from there to Amalfi in Italy, before the end of the 11th century. The pointed arch reduced architectural thrust by about 20% and therefore had practical advantages over the semi-circular Romanesque arch for the building of large structures. The pointed arch as a defining characteristic of Gothic architecture appears to have been introduced from the Islamic, in some areas, but to have evolved as a structural solution in late Romanesque, both in England at Durham Cathedral and in the Burgundian Romanesque and Cistercian architecture of France. =Templar churches= Seal of the Knights Templar featuring a domed building, whether from a dome from Al-Aqsa, the Dome of the Rock or the aedicula of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre In 1119, the Knights Templar received as headquarters part of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, considered by the crusaders the Temple of Solomon, from which the order took its common name. The typical round churches built by the knights across Western Europe, such as the London Temple Church, are probably inspired by the shape of Al-Aqsa or the Dome of the RockGod and Enchantment of Place: Reclaiming Human Experience, David Brown, Oxford University Press, 2004, page 203. Islamic elements in Renaissance art Pseudo-Kufic script in the Virgin Mary's halo, detail of Adoration of the Magi (1423) by Gentile da Fabriano. The script is further divided by rosettes like those on Mamluk dishes. Pseudo-Kufic Pseudo-Kufic is a decorative motif that resembles Kufic script and occurs in many Italian Renaissance paintings. The exact reason for the incorporation of pseudo-Kufic in early Renaissance works is unclear. It seems that Westerners mistakenly associated 13th-14th-century Middle-Eastern scripts as being identical with the scripts current during Jesus's time, and thus found natural to represent early Christians in association with them: \\"In Renaissance art, pseudo-Kufic script was used to decorate the costumes of Old Testament heroes like David\\".Freider. p.84 Mack states another hypothesis: Oriental carpets Verrocchio's Madonna with Saint John the Baptist and Donatus 1475-1483 with small-pattern Holbein Islamic carpet at her feet. Carpets of Middle-Eastern origin, either from the Ottoman Empire, the Levant or the Mamluk state of Egypt or Northern Africa, were used as important decorative features in paintings from the 13th century onwards, and especially in religious painting, starting from the Medieval period and continuing into the Renaissance period. Such carpets were often integrated into Christian imagery as symbols of luxury and status of Middle-Eastern origin, and together with Pseudo-Kufic script offer an interesting example of the integration of Eastern elements into European painting. Anatolian rugs were used in Transylvania as decoration in Evangelical churches. Islamic costumes 15th-century Mamluks depicted in The Arrest of St. Mark from the Synagogue, Giovanni di Niccol√≤ Mansueti, 1499. Islamic individuals and costumes often provided the contextual backdrop to describe an evangelical scene. This was particularly visible in a set of Venetian paintings in which contemporary Syrian, Palestinian, Egyptian and especially Mamluk personages are employed anachronistically in paintings describing Biblical situations. An example in point is the 15th century The Arrest of St. Mark from the Synagogue by Giovanni di Niccol√≤ Mansueti which accurately describes contemporary (15th century) Alexandrian Mamluks arresting Saint Mark in an historic scene of the 1st century CE. Another case is Gentile Bellini's Saint Mark Preaching in Alexandria. Ornament A Western style of ornament based on the Islamic arabesque developed, beginning in late 15th century Venice; it has been called either moresque or western arabesque (a term with a complicated history). It has been used in a great variety of the decorative arts but has been especially long-lived in book design and bookbinding, where small motifs in this style have continued to be used by conservative book designers up to the present day. It is seen in gold tooling on covers, borders for illustrations, and printer's ornaments for decorating empty spaces on the page. In this field the technique of gold tooling had also arrived in the 15th century from the Islamic world, and indeed much of the leather itself was imported from there. Like other Renaissance ornament styles it was disseminated by ornament prints which were bought as patterns by craftsmen in a variety of trades. Peter Furhring, a leading specialist in the history of ornament, says that: > The ornament known as moresque in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (but > now more commonly called arabesque) is characterized by bifurcated scrolls > composed of branches forming interlaced foliage patterns. These basic motifs > gave rise to numerous variants, for example, where the branches, generally > of a linear character, were turned into straps or bands. ... It is > characteristic of the moresque, which is essentially a surface ornament, > that it is impossible to locate the pattern's beginning or end. ... > Originating in the Middle East, they were introduced to continental Europe > via Italy and Spain ... Italian examples of this ornament, which was often > used for bookbindings and embroidery, are known from as early as the late > fifteenth century. Elaborate book bindings with Islamic designs can be seen in religious paintings. In Andrea Mantegna's Saint John the Baptist and Zeno, Saint John and Zeno hold exquisite books with covers displaying Mamluk-style center- pieces, of a type also used in contemporary Italian book-binding.

Its importance has increased because of the vast and quickly increasing amount of legal documents available through electronic means.Jackson et al., p. 60 Legal information retrieval is a part of the growing field of legal informatics.  Overview  In a legal setting, it is frequently important to retrieve all information related to a specific query. However, commonly used boolean search methods (exact matches of specified terms) on full text legal documents have been shown to have an average recall rate as low as 20 percent,Blair, D.C., and Maron, M.E., 1985, p.293 meaning that only 1 in 5 relevant documents are actually retrieved. In that case, researchers believed that they had retrieved over 75% of relevant documents. This may result in failing to retrieve important or precedential cases. In some jurisdictions this may be especially problematic, as legal professionals are ethically obligated to be reasonably informed as to relevant legal documents.American Bar Association, Model Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 1.1, http://www.abanet.org/cpr/mrpc/rule_1_1.html Legal Information Retrieval attempts to increase the effectiveness of legal searches by increasing the number of relevant documents (providing a high recall rate) and reducing the number of irrelevant documents (a high precision rate). This is a difficult task, as the legal field is prone to jargon,Peters, W. et al. 2007, p. 118 polysemesPeters, W. et al. 2007, p. 130 (words that have different meanings when used in a legal context), and constant change. Techniques used to achieve these goals generally fall into three categories: boolean retrieval, manual classification of legal text, and natural language processing of legal text.  Problems  Application of standard information retrieval techniques to legal text can be more difficult than application in other subjects. One key problem is that the law rarely has an inherent taxonomy.Peters, W. et al. 2007, p. 120 Instead, the law is generally filled with open-ended terms, which may change over time. This can be especially true in common law countries, where each decided case can subtly change the meaning of a certain word or phrase.Saravanan, M. et al. 2009, p. 101 Legal information systems must also be programmed to deal with law-specific words and phrases. Though this is less problematic in the context of words which exist solely in law, legal texts also frequently use polysemes, words may have different meanings when used in a legal or common-speech manner, potentially both within the same document. The legal meanings may be dependent on the area of law in which it is applied. For example, in the context of European Union legislation, the term \\"worker\\" has four different meanings:Peters, W. et al. 2007, p. 131 #Any worker as defined in Article 3(a) of Directive 89/391/EEC who habitually uses display screen equipment as a significant part of his normal work. #Any person employed by an employer, including trainees and apprentices but excluding domestic servants; #Any person carrying out an occupation on board a vessel, including trainees and apprentices, but excluding port pilots and shore personnel carrying out work on board a vessel at the quayside; #Any person who, in the Member State concerned, is protected as an employee under national employment law and in accordance with national practice; It also has the common meaning: 5. A person who works at a specific occupation. Though the terms may be similar, correct information retrieval must differentiate between the intended use and irrelevant uses in order to return the correct results. Even if a system overcomes the language problems inherent in law, it must still determine the relevancy of each result. In the context of judicial decisions, this requires determining the precedential value of the case.Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2008, p. 8 Case decisions from senior or superior courts may be more relevant than those from lower courts, even where the lower court's decision contains more discussion of the relevant facts. The opposite may be true, however, if the senior court has only a minor discussion of the topic (for example, if it is a secondary consideration in the case). A information retrieval system must also be aware of the authority of the jurisdiction. A case from a binding authority is most likely of more value than one from a non-binding authority. Additionally, the intentions of the user may determine which cases they find valuable. For instance, where a legal professional is attempting to argue a specific interpretation of law, he might find a minor court's decision which supports his position more valuable than a senior courts position which does not. He may also value similar positions from different areas of law, different jurisdictions, or dissenting opinions. Overcoming these problems can be made more difficult because of the large number of cases available. The number of legal cases available via electronic means is constantly increasing (in 2003, US appellate courts handed down approximately 500 new cases per day), meaning that an accurate legal information retrieval system must incorporate methods of both sorting past data and managing new data.Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2007, p.1  Techniques  Boolean searches Boolean searches, where a user may specify terms such as use of specific words or judgments by a specific court, are the most common type of search available via legal information retrieval systems. They are widely implemented but overcome few of the problems discussed above. The recall and precision rates of these searches vary depending on the implementation and searches analyzed. One study found a basic boolean search's recall rate to be roughly 20%, and its precision rate to be roughly 79%. Another study implemented a generic search (that is, not designed for legal uses) and found a recall rate of 56% and a precision rate of 72% among legal professionals. Both numbers increased when searches were run by non-legal professionals, to a 68% recall rate and 77% precision rate. This is likely explained because of the use of complex legal terms by the legal professionals.Saravanan M., et al. 2009, p. 116 Manual classification In order to overcome the limits of basic boolean searches, information systems have attempted to classify case laws and statutes into more computer friendly structures. Usually, this results in the creation of an ontology to classify the texts, based on the way a legal professional might think about them.Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2008, p. 2 These attempt to link texts on the basis of their type, their value, and/or their topic areas. Most major legal search providers now implement some sort of classification search, such as Westlaw's ‚ÄúNatural Language‚ÄùWestlaw Research, http://www.westlaw.com or LexisNexis' HeadnoteLexis Research, http://www.lexisnexis.com searches. Additionally, both of these services allow browsing of their classifications, via Westlaw's West Key Numbers or Lexis' Headnotes. Though these two search algorithms are proprietary and secret, it is known that they employ manual classification of text (though this may be computer-assisted). These systems can help overcome the majority of problems inherent in legal information retrieval systems, in that manual classification has the greatest chances of identifying landmark cases and understanding the issues that arise in the text.Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2008, p. 3 In one study, ontological searching resulted in a precision rate of 82% and a recall rate of 97% among legal professionals.Saravanan, M. et al. 2009, p. 116 The legal texts included, however, were carefully controlled to just a few areas of law in a specific jurisdiction.Saravanan, M. et al. 2009, p. 103 The major drawback to this approach is the requirement of using highly skilled legal professionals and large amounts of time to classify texts.Schweighofer, E. and Liebwald, D. 2008, p. 108 As the amount of text available continues to increase, some have stated their belief that manual classification is unsustainable.Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2008, p. 4 Natural language processing In order to reduce the reliance on legal professionals and the amount of time needed, efforts have been made to create a system to automatically classify legal text and queries.Ashley, K.D. and Bruninghaus, S. 2009, p. 125Gelbart, D. and Smith, J.C. 1993, p. 142 Adequate translation of both would allow accurate information retrieval without the high cost of human classification. These automatic systems generally employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that are adapted to the legal domain, and also require the creation of a legal ontology. Though multiple systems have been postulated, few have reported results. One system, ‚ÄúSMILE,‚Äù which attempted to automatically extract classifications from case texts, resulted in an f-measure (which is a calculation of both recall rate and precision) of under 0.3 (compared to perfect f-measure of 1.0).Ashley, K.D. and Bruninghaus, S. 2009, p. 159 This is probably much lower than an acceptable rate for general usage.Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2009, p. 3 Despite the limited results, many theorists predict that the evolution of such systems will eventually replace manual classification systems.Maxwell, K.T., and Schafer, B. 2009, p. 9Ashley, K.D. and Bruninghaus, S. 2009, p. 126  Citation-Based ranking  In the mid-90s the Room 5 case law retrieval project used citation mining for summaries and ranked its search results based on citation type and count. This slightly pre- dated the Page Rank algorithm at Stanford which was also a citation-based ranking. Ranking of results was based as much on jurisdiction as on number of references. Loui, R.

The body of the larvae is cylindrical and slightly flattened and is up to long. The pupa is in length. The antennae of the pupa extend beyond the wings at the level of the eighth segment. Behavior Damaged wood from Xeris spectrum galleries and pupal chambers Xeris spectrum are found in open pine forests. Males often begin to fly a few days earlier than females. The females drill their ovipositors into the tree, just under the bark, and deposit their eggs. Females lay eggs in coniferous trees, usually spruce, pine and larch. Although Xeris spectrum does not have any symbiotic fungi, it often takes advantage of the fungal symbionts of other wood wasp species. A study of the reproductive strategies of Xeris spectrum showed that the females often lay their eggs on wood where other wood wasps of species with symbiotic fungi have already laid their eggs. This allows the Xeris spectrum larvae to benefit from the fungi. In addition, adult Xeris spectrum emerge from their holes at two different times: one group emerges in summer with the species of other wood wasps, while the other group emerges the next spring. The larvae are very different from the adults, both in lifestyle and appearance. The newly hatched larvae have access to food in the wood of damaged trees. As the larvae gnaw on the wood, the holes grow wider and deeper. Evidence of the larvae is noticeable in the deposits of wood chips and faeces that are left behind by the larvae. Just before the chrysalis stage larva boring a small chamber about into the tree. Xeris spectrum belongs to the group of insects with complete metamorphosis (Endopterygota), who undergoes a metamorphosis during development. Between the larval stage and the adult stage is the chrysalis stage, a rest period, in which wasps inner and outer bodies change. The larvae's pliable and soft body is transformed into a pupa with a hard shell. When the shell is hard starting transformation from larva to the adult. The internal organs are lost in varying degrees down to a cell mass. A reorganization takes place and the animal transformed. The length of the pupa phase varies according to temperature. The entire development from egg to adult takes several years. Damage Xeris spectrum is considered to be a pest in the timber industry. The damage caused by the wasp damages the wood and decreases its value. Xeris spectrum is most prevalent in homogeneous stands of fir and mixed stands of fir and spruce that have been damaged by wind, fire, snow and pathogenic fungi. The density of the larvae can reach up to 60 specimens in of tree stem.

It was the first in a series of great earthquakes that ruptured part of the Sumatran segment of the Sunda megathrust. It caused a damaging tsunami that was particularly severe near Padang, where a 150‚Äì200 ton English ship was driven 1 km inland up the Arau River. Background The island of Sumatra lies on the convergent plate boundary between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The convergence between these plates is highly oblique near Sumatra, with the displacement being accommodated by near pure dip-slip faulting along the subduction zone, known as the Sunda megathrust, and near pure strike-slip faulting along the Great Sumatran fault. The major slip events on the subduction zone interface are typically of the megathrust type. Historically, great or giant megathrust earthquakes have been recorded in 1797, 1833, 1861, 2004, 2005 and 2007, most of them being associated with devastating tsunamis. Smaller (but still large) megathrust events have also occurred in the small gaps between the areas that slip during these larger events, in 1935, 1984, 2000 and 2002. Damage The earthquake caused the collapse or damage of many houses. The tsunami surge drove an English sailing ship of 150‚Äì200 tons, moored in the Arau River, about 1 km inland, destroying several houses as it went. Smaller boats were driven up to 1.8 km upstream. In Air Manis, the whole town was flooded and the bodies of several people who had climbed trees to escape the surge were found the next day in the branches. Only two fatalities were reported from Padang itself but many more from Air Manis. The Batu Islands were also reported to be affected. Characteristics 250px Earthquake The shaking at Padang lasted one minute. Reports in 1845 and 1847 said either that this was the strongest earthquake in the memory of the residents of Padang or the strongest for forty years. Tsunami The run-up of the tsunami at Padang and the village of Air Manis is estimated to be in the range of 5-10 m. Modelling of tsunami effects using source parameters estimated from the uplift of coral microatolls, provide a reasonable match to the sparse historical records. The tsunami reports for this event are localised around Padang and it has been suggested that the tsunami may have been caused by an underwater landslide triggered by the earthquake.
