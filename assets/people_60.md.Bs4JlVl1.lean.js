The state was founded in 1785 and its capital was located in Ajaigarh, Madhya Pradesh. Ajaigarh's last ruler signed the accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1950. History Ajaigarh was the capital of a princely state of the same name during the British Raj. Ajaigarh was founded in 1765 by Guman Singh, who was the nephew of Raja Pahar Singh of Jaitpur State. After Ajaigarh was captured by the British in 1809, it became a princely state in the Bundelkhand Agency of the Central India Agency. It had an area of 771 mile2 (1997 km2), and a population of 78,236 in 1901. The rulers bore the title of sawai maharaja. He commanded an estimated annual revenue of about ¬£15,000/-, and paid a tribute of ¬£460/-. The chief resided at the town of Nowgong, at the foot of the hill-fortress of Ajaigarh, from which the state took its name. This fort, situated on a steep hill, towers more than 800 ft (244 m) above the eponymous township, and contains the ruins of several temples adorned with elaborately carved sculptures. The town was often afflicted by malaria, and suffered severely from famine in 1868-1869 and 1896‚Äì1897. The state acceded to the Government of India on 1 January 1950; the ruling chief was granted a privy purse of Rs. 74,700/-, and the courtesy use of his styles and titles. All of these were revoked by the government of India in 1971, at the time when these privileges were revoked from all erstwhile princes. The former princely state became part of the new Indian state of Vindhya Pradesh, and most of the territory of the former state, including the town of Ajaigarh, became part of Panna District, with a smaller portion going to Chhatarpur District. Vindhya Pradesh was merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956.

It originates in the province of Catanzaro, and takes its name from the former town of Nicastro, which since 1968 has been part of Lamezia Terme. The Nicastrese is raised mainly in the area of origin, but also in the neighbouring provinces of Cosenza and Reggio Calabria. Photographic evidence suggests that it may be closely connected to the old \\"Araba\\" breed of the area. The Nicastrese is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders. The breed was officially recognised in June 2004. On 1 January 2002 the total number for the breed was estimated at 8000; at the end of 2013 the registered population was variously reported as 4975 and as 4454. Use The average milk yield of the Nicastrese is 180 litres in 150 days for primiparous, 220 l in 210 days for secondiparous, and 260 l in 210 days for pluriparous, nannies. The milk averages 4.3% fat, 3.5% protein and 4.7% lactose.

A festival is an event ordinarily staged by a community, centering on and celebrating some unique aspect of that community and its traditions, often marked as a local or national holiday, mela, or eid. A festival is a special occasion of feasting or celebration, usually with a religious focus. Aside from religion, and sometimes folklore, another significant origin is agricultural. Food (and consequently agriculture) is so vital that many festivals are associated with harvest time. Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in autumn such as Halloween in the northern hemisphere and Easter in the southern.

It depicts the King (Pharaoh) as a child and dates from the 18th Dynasty (New Kingdom). The object received the find number of 8 and today is displayed with the inventory number JE 60723 in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.  Discovery  The discovery of the Head of Nefertem is controversial, since Howard Carter did not document the piece in his excavation journal. The Head was found in 1924 by Pierre Lacau and Rex Engelbach in KV4 (the tomb of Ramses XI), which was used as a storehouse for the excavation efforts, among the bottles in a box of red wine.Thomas Hoving: Tutankhamun: The Untold Story. pp. 318‚Äì324. At this time, Carter was not in Egypt on account of the strike and closure of Tutankhamun's tomb and the withdrawal or cancellation of the excavation license of Lord Carnarvon's widow Lady Almina. Carter later stated that he had found the head among the rubble in the entry corridor of KV62.Zahi Hawass: King Tutankhamun. The Treasures Of The Tomb. p. 16. In his first season of excavations, the head was not mentioned; at the time Carter only noted partially broken and full-standing alabaster vessels and vases of painted clay in the entrance-way. There is not even photographic documentation of the head in the excavation journal as there is for other pieces found in the tomb.Griffith Institute, Oxford,Howard Carter's diaries and journals. Part 1: October 28 to December 31, 1922. The first excavation season in the tomb of Tutankhamun. 25 and 26 November 1922 These facts not only led to further disputes in the study of Egyptian antiquities, but also aroused the suspicion in some quarters to this day that Carter had attempted to steal the head.Andreas Austilat, Arch√§ologie: Retter oder R√§uber? In Tagesspiegel 22 January 2010.  Description  Tutankhamun as Nefertem emerging from a blue lotus bloom, Egyptian Museum, Cairo The partially damaged head of Nefertem is carved out of wood and is high. The stucco coating is painted red, though large sections have been damaged; Carter attributed this to its seizure by Egyptian authorities in 1921.The Griffith Institute, Oxford. Tutankhamun: Anatomy of an Excavation. The Howard Carter Archives. \\"Head of the King\\", Carter No. 008 The eyebrows, the typically Egyptian kohl eye liner, and the pupils of the bust were painted in dark blue. The head of the king is completely shaved, but shaven stubble in the form of black paint is visible. The head has Tutankhamun's facial features and depicts him as a child. As on his golden deathmask, Tutankhamun's ears are pierced. Of all the artefacts found to date, this head is the only depiction of him as a child.Peter Munro: Tutanchamun als Sonnengott. In the exhibition catalogue Tutanchamun in K√∂ln. p. 140.  Significance  The sculpture depicts the Pharaoh in the guise of Nefertem, the god of the dawning sun.I.E.S. Edwards, Tutankhamun: His Tomb and its Treasures. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art & Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1976, 18.Zahi Hawass. Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs. Washington, DC: National Geographic, 2005, 81 The child- god Nefertem springs from a blue lotus, which was associated with the revival of the Sun in the morning because its buds close at night and reopen at dawn.Zahi Hawass. Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs. Washington, DC: National Geographic, 2005, 64 The blue base of the bust symbolises the primordial waters from which the sun rose at the beginning of creation. The Pharaoh was closely associated with the Sun, but the depiction of him in the guise of this particular solar deity was meant to magically guarantee that the Pharaoh would be reborn once more, just as the Sun is reborn at dawn.Zahi Hawass. Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs. Washington, DC: National Geographic, 2005, 15  In Egyptian art  Like the depictions of the daughters of Akhenaten and Nefertiti found at Tell el-Amarna, the head of Nefertem has the elongated head and neck wrinkles typical of Amarna art. This suggests that the creation of the head occurred during the Amarna period. The depiction of the king as a child is among the most beautiful of all Egyptian art from the end of the 18th Dynasty. The head of Nefertem has been exhibited in travelling exhibitions of selected original finds from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including, among others, the Treasures of Tutankhamun (1972‚Äì1981).Exhibition catalogue Tutanchamun in K√∂ln. von Zabern, Mainz 1980, .

It was built during the first half of the 13th century and contains sculptural decoration in both Romanesque and Gothic styles. The interior is decorated by medieval wall paintings. It belongs to the parish V√§skinde, in the Diocese of Visby. History and architecture The current church was built during the first half of the 13th century and replaced an earlier stone church on the same site, fragments of which still remain in the wall between the choir and nave. Of the presently visible church, the choir is the oldest part, with the nave and tower being built successively. Paintings were added in the 13th century through 15th centuries. For some reason, the tower was never finished and does not reach its originally intended height. The church has two portals on the western fa√ßade, one leading to the choir and a larger main portal, located on the south side of the nave. The smaller is the older and still Romanesque in style, while the main portal is Gothic, and more elaborate. Additionally, there is an entrance on the north fa√ßade. The window openings are all original, and have not been enlarged during later centuries. Inside, the church is decorated by medieval murals, uncovered in the early 21st century. They depict the Passion of Christ and scenes from the Bible. The church has some medieval items: a triumphal cross (late 13th century), a baptismal font (13th century), and a wooden sculpture depicting Mary. The altarpiece is Baroque, executed in 1664, and the pulpit is from 1744. The church was renovated in 1965-66, and again in the early 2000s (decade). B√§l Church lies in the parish V√§skinde, in the Diocese of Visby. It is used by the Church of Sweden.

The Foundation‚Äôs mission is to form correct academic and historical understanding of Russian abstract art in the global context.  Collection  The collection of the Foundation is based on creative work by members of The New Reality artistic group, as well as on vast archival material, connected with their art, the Foundation aims at defining and demonstrating the place of this group in particular, and Russian abstraction in general, in the evolvement line of history of art. Foundation is focusing on the artists, who were attending Studio for a long time and formed the very core of it, such as Ely Beliutin, Vladislav Zubarev, Lutsian Gribkov, Vera Preobrazhenskaya, Tamara Ter- Gevondyan, Anatoly Safokhin, Svetlana Nekrasova, Elena Radkevich, Alexander Krukov. The New Reality Studio was a group of abstract artists, it emerged at end the 1950s and had been existing until the death of their leader Ely Beliutin in 2012. Their aim was the revival and natural development of the Russian avant-garde and abstract art of 1920s. Abstract art, having started with works by Wassily Kandinsky, did not get development in Russia, and for almost 30 years was excluded from professional vocabulary, but, in spite of this, gained a powerful momentum in the West.https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/exhibits/origins-of-the-russian-avant- garde,1080034.html Works by Wassily Kandinsky, Kazimir Malevich, Larionov, Lisitsky, Alexander Rodchenko illustrate these artists‚Äô unique experiments with color, shape, space, but, first and foremost, they vividly reflected changing social identities, that is, fulfilled the main purpose of art. Ely Bielutin made it his mission to create truly contemporary art, and as a result of his activities, aspired to found a new Academy of Arts. This makes members of his group followers of the early 20th century masters not only from the formal-stylistic point of view, but ideologically as well. That is why their intellectual and creative heritage is indispensable for understanding evolvement of any innovative idea in art.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/rbth/culture/8006418/Documentary-on- forbidden-Russian-avant-garde-art-The-Desert-of-Forbidden-Art.html  Foundation‚Äôs Mission  Studies of the system of interaction with artists, devised by Ely Bielutin and his disciple Vladislav Zubarev, and analysis of Bielutin‚Äôs theory of common ability to contact and Zubarev‚Äôs theory of temporal art demonstrated that these methods are universal and can be used working with people of various occupations, not only of creative professions. The Foundation developed an educational program based on these theories that includes lectures and workshops, and is being prepared for introduction into Russian higher education institutions. To realize its goals the Foundation plans to engage into intensive educational activities, including cooperation with Russian and foreign non-profit and academic organizations, public-owned and private museums. The Foundation‚Äôs activities are not limited to collaborating with acknowledged masters, but are oriented towards engaging young artists who dedicate their art to current issues and search for new creative forms. The second goal of the Foundation is to adapt and integrate new methods into educational process in order to help develop original creative thinking in students.

Its purpose is to enable the extraction of rich mineral deposits in the eastern Limpopo province, and to supply water to towns, industries and communities in the Sekhukhune district, where service delivery was of a poor standard. The completion of the dam was delayed by four years (2010 to 2014) due to supply chain problems, technical and equipment problems, deficient environmental impact studies, resettlement of families in the area, and labour strikes. The flagship dam in the Olifants system, South Africa's largest dam since the 1970s, was developed by the Department of Water Affairs. The project of R3,4 billion involved innovative solutions in energy dissipation and the use of roller-compacted concrete, for which the department received a Fulton award.Awarded by the Concrete Society of Southern Africa It was the second phase of the Olifants River Water Resources Development Programme (ORWRDP), the only viable solution for water delivery to the Nebo plateau, where some 800,000 people are resident. The first phase, completed in 2006, included capacity improvements to the Flag Boshielo Dam.

Louis Vivet (also Louis Viv√© or Vive) (b. February 12, 1863, in Paris, France) was one of the first mental health patients to be diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, colloquially known as \\"multiple [or] split personalities.\\" Within one year of his 1885 diagnosis, the term \\"multiple personality\\" appeared in psychological literature in direct reference to Vivet.  Early life and first symptoms  Vivet was born on February 12, 1863, in Paris to a young mother who worked as a prostitute and who beat and neglected him. After turning to crime at age eight, Vivet was sent to a house of corrections, where he was raised until the age of 18. While working on a farm at age 17, Vivet became paralyzed from the waist down due to severe trauma resulting from a viper wrapping itself around his hand, inducing psychosomatic paralysis. Vivet went on to work as a tailor during his paralysis, until one-and-a-half years later, when he suddenly regained the use of his legs and began walking. When confronted by the asylum (which had begun housing him upon his paralysis) regarding his newfound ability to walk, Vivet responded with confusion, not recognizing any of the hospital staff and accusing them of imprisoning him.  Diagnosis and multiple personalities  Dr. Bourneville = Diagnosis and treatment = Although Vivet was purported to have up to ten personalities, recent re-evaluations of the medical literature has led some psychologists to believe that he had only two personalities, and that any other personalities were the direct result of hypnosis by therapists. Vivet's symptoms, including loss of time and amnesia, were explained by the first psychologist to treat him, Camuset, as divisions in his personality, and were not directly linked to his history of childhood trauma until his case was re-evaluated approximately 100 years later. Some experts believe that Vivet did not have DID at all, and that his behavior was similar to that of a fugue state. Philosopher Ian Hacking has argued that the term \\"multiple personality disorder\\" first came into use on July 25, 1885, when Vivet entered the health system and became the subject of intensive psychiatric experimentation. He was subjected to a variety of treatments for what doctors initially believed to be \\"hysteria,\\" including \\"morphines, injections of pilocarpine, oil of ipecac to induce vomiting, and magnets on numerous parts of the body; but the only treatment that could halt an attack was pressure on the achilles tendon or the rotulian tendon below the kneecap...he was repeatedly hypnotized.\\" = Multiple personalities = The return of Vivet's motor skills was accompanied by a stark change in personality: when paralyzed, Vivet was kind, reserved, intellectual, and meek, while in his walking state, he was arrogant, confrontational, and conniving. Vivet's memories were segregated entirely between his different personalities. He had no recollection of his actions conducted as his various personalities...he could only recall the memories of his current personality, except any memories pre-dating the traumatic viper incident. Psychologist Pierre Janet described Vivet as having six different \\"existences.\\" He continues:  In popular culture  * Robert Louis Stevenson was influenced by Vivet's story while writing the novella Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

After being on the road for several years, attracted by a bohemian lifestyle, he decided to live with a native tribe in the Amazon rainforest before moving to Europe to form the music group Robby Maria & The Silent Revolution, which gained cult status in the Berlin alternative music scene.  Early life  Robby Maria was born Robert Maria Mu√±oz on August 10, 1971. His mother Maria Teresa Mu√±oz was of Argentinian origin and his father Alfred an Austrian natural scienist from Vienna. Growing up in the southern German countryside, Maria first pursued a career as a football professional, which was suddenly terminated at the age of 14. The family literally impoverished overnight, removals followed and Maria withdrawed into the world of music moving to Hollywood, California. There he hoped to establish a rock band but the industry tried to turn the songwriter into a Latin Lover type of Act, which Maria strictly refused to be. He accepted a job in a New Orleans paint shop, saved enough money to leave the U.S. and traveled almost the entire South American continent by foot, bus and boat. Maria joined a native tribe in the Amazon rainforest and got initialized by the tribe's shaman.  Career  = 2005-2012: Killmotorhill and Robby Maria & The Silent Revolution = Maria returned to Europe to readapt his musical career and once again moved to Germany. In a Berlin shared apartment he got introduced to drummer Anni M√ºller with whom he started the band Killmotorhill playing locations in and around Berlin. In 2008 bass player Simon Birkholz joined the duo and the new established trio renamed to Robby Maria & The Silent Revolution. The self- produced and self-distributed EP Apocalyptic Folk Music gained the band cult status among the alternative music scene after being turned down by several record labels before. Nevertheless, the band broke up shortly after the release of their self-titled debut album on April 20, 2012 due to musical and personal differences. Robby Maria & The Silent Revolution were reported to have played their last gig on August 5, 2012 at the Berlin Teahouse Open Air in the city's largest urban park Tiergarten. Around the same time Maria appeared on a non-commercial side-project with composer Stephan Metzner. Under the name of Metzner & Maria the two musicians recorded and published a limited edition of their \\"song and poetry album\\" 9o1 Independence on the isle of Cyprus within only 3 months of time. Maria and Metzner financed the venture themselves not wanting any outside production company to \\"spoil the authenticity of the work\\". Metropolis 2013 = 2013: Metropolis = In late 2012 Robby signed a contract with the German independent label Timezone and began working on his first solo album Metropolis which was released on March 8, 2013, shortly after the release of the digital single Days in the City in February. The Album received particularly good reviews in Germany and Austria, comparing Maria's voice to the young David Bowie and enabling him to embarque on his very first solo tour ever, playing 66 locations throughout Europe within four months. On the \\"Metropolis-Tour\\" Maria presented the songs of the Album strictly acoustic with only an acoustic guitar and his voice. = 2014: Welcome To My Secret Heart = On July 15, 2014 Maria's Label announced the release of the follow-up album Welcome To My Secret Heart on October 10, 2014. Maria had been working on the tracks for the new album in the recording studios of the formerly broadcasting company of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin during the winter. On July 17 Maria confirmed this information by posting some pictures of the studios on Facebook with the caption \\"Here we recorded the album:'Welcome To My Secret Heart' On February 6, still being in the recording process of the album, Maria performed three songs at the Troubadour Festival in Berlin. The first single \\"Sick Young Man\\", was released on September 19, presenting Maria as a lost soul in the midst of a highly socialised environment followed by the release of Welcome To My Secret Heart on October 10. A second single, \\"The Game\\", was released on November 21, 2014 alongside the previously unreleased bonus track Father in order to promote the Album. Maria described his second studio album as being \\"still apocalyptic and dark but in a more personal sense and with the help of several guest musicians from all over Europe and Canada.\\"  Musical Style  As his musical style did not fit any categorization, Maria came up with the term of \\"Apocalyptic Folk Music\\" referring to the combination of dark, poetic lyrics and melodic vocals based on folky guitar arrangements His music has also been noted for its untypical singer songwriter character with European dimension and its references to various aspects of pop culture, particularly that of the era of young David Bowie.

It can be viewed as a decolonization of science. MƒÅori science is practiced by the MƒÅori people; the indigenous people of New Zealand. As a result of separation from the other nations, the MƒÅori developed their own culture and practices. Largely a product of MƒÅori Renaissance of the later 20th and early 21st centuries, most MƒÅori science is project-based with science-based organisation partner with iwi organisations and typically government funding. Outputs typically include traditional scientific outputs (i.e. articles in peer reviewed journals) as well as concrete benefits for iwi. Examples include: * Geothermal toxicity in food: NIWA / Te Arawa Lakes Trust. *Identifying novel antimicrobial compounds: Victoria University of Wellington / NgƒÅpuhi / NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua o Kaipara. MƒÅori science is taught at a tertiary level at Victoria University of Wellington and Canterbury University. Women in Maori Science Women have made great contributions to MƒÅori science. One notable woman was Wahakaotirangi. Wahakaotirangi brought kumara to the Waikato region of New Zealand. When in Waikato, Wahakaotirangi built gardens in which she experimented with growing edible and medicinal plants, in particular studying how to make the kumara grow in the cooler climate of Waikato. This was an essential innovation for the Tainui people of Waikato, as it provided them a reliable and sustainable source of food. Wahakaotirangi was also a part of the invention and launch of the Tainui canoe. Other notable women in the field of MƒÅori science are Makereti Papakura, who wrote a thesis on the MƒÅori people, and Rina Winifred Moore, the first female Maori doctor in New Zealand. Colonization and erasure MƒÅori society refers to experts in a skill or art as tohunga. Tohunga were often the only source of medicinal knowledge and education in MƒÅori culture. The New Zealand Parliament passed the Tohunga Suppression Act in 1907 - this made tohunga status illegal and punishable by fines or imprisonment. The Act stayed in operation until 1962, and caused in part the erasure of MƒÅori knowledge and science. Impact MƒÅori science had major impacts on New Zealand. For example, Wahakaotirangi‚Äôs innovations in agriculture ensured the formation and survival of the Tainui people. This influence persists, and is seen in such cases as the New Zealand Department of Conservation‚Äôs Biodiversity Strategy, which states that by 2020, ‚Äútraditional MƒÅori knowledge, or matauranga MƒÅori, about biodiversity is respected and preserved and informs biodiversity management‚Äù.

Michael Honywood D.D. (1597 ‚Äì 7 December 1681) was an English churchman, Dean of Lincoln from 1660. Honywood was a bibliophile and he founded and funded the Lincoln Cathedral Library. Life He was sixth son and ninth child of Robert Honywood of Charing, Kent, and of Marks Hall, Essex, by his second wife, Elizabeth. daughter of Sir Thomas Browne of Betchworth Castle, Surrey; Mary Honywood was his grandmother, and the parliamentarian Sir Thomas Honywood an elder brother. He was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, and graduated B.A. in January 1615, M.A. 1618, B.D. 1636, and D.D. (by royal mandate) 1661. Honywood became fellow of Christ's, where Thomas Bainbridge was master, and served the university offices of taxor in 1623, and of proctor in 1628. Richard Crackenthorpe, a friend, records help received from Honywood in his work on logic. He took part in college management, and helped forward the erection of the new fellows' buildings, completed in 1644, by advancing money, which was not repaid till 27 August 1649. While Honywood remained a fellow, John Milton was not eligible for a fellowship, under a statute limiting fellows to just one per county (by birth: Honywood and Milton were both born in Middlesex. In 1640 Honywoood was appointed to the college living of Kegworth, Leicestershire, but he did not reside there; and when the First English Civil War threatened Cambridge at the beginning of 1642, he crossed to the Low Countries. During the protectorate he was at Utrecht, enjoying the friendship of William Sancroft and devoting himself to the collection of books. Another fellow bibliophile and friend from this time was Thomas Browne. In 1643 Bainbridge ineffectually wrote to Honywood urging him to return, so as not to exceed the statutable limit of absence, which would defeat his wish that Honywood should succeed him as master. In 1645 Honywood was still abroad. Over Bainbridge's protests, the parliamentary commissioners for Leicestershire sequestered Honywood's living of Kegworth, and a new rector was appointed in 1649. At the Restoration Honywood returned to England, and resumed his living of Kegworth. The sectaries in his parish gave him some trouble, and in 1667 Richard Gibson, a Quaker who refused to pay his tithes, was thrown into prison, and was detained there several years at Honywood's suit. Some of the fellows of Christ's College hoped that he might be appointed master, at a time when Ralph Cudworth held the post. On 12 October 1660 Honywood was installed dean of Lincoln, retaining Kegworth in commendam for the rest of his life. He set to work to repair damage done to Lincoln Cathedral and its precincts, and re-established the long-suspended choral service, finding money for both from his own purse. He defended the old rights of the dean and chapter, and reasserted the franchises of the close. Honywell died unmarried at his deanery on 7 December 1681, aged 85. He gave ¬£100 towards the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral. Friends included Herbert Thorndike, Humphrey Henchman and George Morley, and Samuel Pepys, who called him \\"a simple priest, though a good well- meaning man\\" (Diary, 6 August 1664). Lincoln Cathedral library Wren Library, Lincoln Cathedral Honywood's major work contribution to Lincoln Cathedral was to spend ¬£780 of his own money on the library which was designed by Sir Christopher Wren, on the site of the ruined north walk of the cloister. In this building he placed 5,000 of his own books, which he presented to the chapter. Honywood's books were in two collections. His first collection was gathered in England and it had been seized by Parliamentary forces when he was abroad. His brothers are thought to have interceded as his eldest brother was a Parliamentarian colonel. The second part of the collection consisted of the books that Honywood had purchased whilst he was in Holland before the Restoration. The collection contained (2014) a series of rare seventeenth- century tracts, including the first issue of John Milton's Lycidas, his Tetrachordon, and Smectymnuus. Early printed books of William Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde and others, which originally formed part of Honywood's library, were sold by the chapter at the suggestion of Thomas Frognall Dibdin, with his Lincolne Nosegaie. Today the \\"Wren Library\\" contains portraits of Honywood and his grandmother, Mary Honywood, who had 114 grandchildren.The Wren Library, Anna Marie Roos, Royal Society, retrieved 30 December 2014 Family Honywood's memorial in the cathedral nave Honeywood's grandmother was Mary Honywood a woman known for her longevity and the number of descendants she had.

First Book Award In 2012, Mack established the First Book Award, in collaboration with the National Media Museum, Bradford and the Wilson Centre for Photography, London. This annual photography publishing award is open to photographers who have not previously had a book published by a third party publishing house (this does not include self-published print on demand projects). The call for submissions emphasises a predilection for projects conceived in book form: works that find a voice through the book. The award is not an open submission ‚Äì but instead each year, a diverse array of international nominators are asked to recommend suitable projects. Submissions open in January, the winner is announced in April, and the winning work is published by Mack and the National Media Museum in June. =Winners= *2012: Anne Sophie Merryman, Mrs. Merryman's Collection. *2013: Paul Salveson, Between the Shell. *2014: Joanna Piotrowska, FROWST. *2015: Ciar√°n √ìg Arnold, I went to the worst of bars hoping to get killed. but all I could do was to get drunk again. *2016: Sofia Borges, The Swamp. *2017: Emmanuelle Andrianjafy, Nothing's in Vain. *2018: Hayahisa Tomiyasu, TTP. *2019: Jerome Ming, Oobanken. *2020: Damian Heinisch, 45.

It was released as the album's lead single on 20 March 2014 through LL Recordings. Background \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\" was written and produced by Lykke Li and Bj√∂rn Yttling for Li's third studio album, I Never Learn (2014). The singer spent two-and-a- half years writing the album in Los Angeles, California, following the end of a long-term romantic relationship. \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\", the second song she penned for the album, was written in Sweden, prior to her move to Los Angeles. Regarding the song, she told The Guardian, \\"I wrote it in Sweden when I was packing up my shit, and I'd just gotten out of a relationship and it was a horrible time. I just had the hurt, shame, sadness, guilt, longing.\\" The vocal track used in the final song is a demo. Yttling played the acoustic guitar, the Moog Taurus and the zither on \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\". Erik Arvinder, Anderas Forsman, Erik Holm and Ketil Solberg played the violin, while Cecilia Linn√© played the cello and Anders Pettersson played the steel guitar. Mariam Wallentin provided additional vocals. Critical reception \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\" garnered positive reviews from music critics. Michael Cragg of The Guardian called it \\"vintage Lykke Li\\". He noted that while it is \\"obviously incredibly sad\\", it still manages to never be \\"morose or cloying\\" as \\"there's something almost uplifting about wallowing in [Li's] pain\\". Jamieson Cox of Time felt the song was a \\"strong preview\\" to I Never Learn. Alex Young of Consequence of Sound said it is not a \\"prototypical sad song\\" as the accented piano instrumentation and the \\"booming\\" chorus add \\"a sense of hope\\" in the midst of the melancholic lyrics. While reviewing I Never Learn for The Independent, Andy Gill recommended readers to download \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\", while Sara Harowitz of Exclaim! picked it as a standout on the album, complementing its drum beats. musicOMH writer John Murphy likened it to Li's previous singles \\"I Follow Rivers\\" and \\"Sadness Is a Blessing\\", labeling it a \\"future classic\\". Drowned in Sound's Tom Fenwick named it a \\"truly captivating single\\". Remix A remixed version of \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\", featuring American rapper ASAP Rocky, premiered exclusively on Beats Music on 21 April 2014. The remix was later made available for download on digital retailers on 28 April 2014. While the instrumentation and Li's vocals are untouched, the remix adds a \\"thumping\\" bass line and a rap verse by ASAP Rocky. Corinne Cummings of Rolling Stone rated the remix three stars out of five, writing, \\"The combination doesn't always exceed the sum of its parts, but Sad Rocky's lyrics ‚Äì 'If love don't work, it just gon' hurt/It all goes bad, it just get worse' ‚Äì have their charms.\\" John Surico Spin commented that \\"So as unlikely as the Swedish singer's recruitment of ASAP Rocky for a remix may look on paper, the team-up actually makes some solid sense.\\" Music video The music video for \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\" was directed by Tarik Saleh and released on 10 April 2014.

It is not generally eaten or used as fodder by farmers but there is some evidence that it has been used as such during periods of famine.Vorontsova, M.S., Dransfield, S., Renvoize, S., Besnard, G., McRobb, A., Razanatsoa, J., Prisca, N.O., Rakotoarisoa, S.E., Ralimanana. (2018). Identification guide to the Grasses and Bamboos in Madagascar. Kew Publishing. Due to the importance of the crop varieties of rice (Oryza. sativa and O. glaberrima) globally, the evolution of the Oryza genus as a whole has been studied extensively.Elert, E. (2014) Rice by the numbers: A good grain. Nature. 514(S50-51). A lot of information about O. punctata has been elucidated as a secondary benefit to this commercial research. O. punctata evolved some 5 million years ago in the second of two rapid radiation events that occurred in the Oryza L. genus.Zou, X.H., Zhang, F.M., Zhang, J.G., Zang, L.L., Tang, L., Wang, T. and Ge, S. (2008). Analysis of 142 genes resolves the rapid diversification of the rice genus. Genome, Biology. 9(R49). Description Oryza punctata is a caespitose (tussock forming) annual hydrophyte (grows in/ on water).Flora Zambesiaca accessed on 10 October 2019 http://apps.kew.org/efloras/namedetail.do?qry=namelist&flora;=fz&taxon;=7908&nameid;=20229 The culm base of O. punctata is spongy and greater than 4mm in diameter. The culm is glabrous (smooth and without hairs) and striate (parallel longitudinal grooves); it is erect or geniculately (bent like a knee) ascending and from 50‚Äì120 cm tall with 3-5 nodes.Harker, K.W. and Napper, D. (1960) An Illustrated Guide to the Grasses of Uganda. The leaf sheath is scarious, often spongy, aerenchymous (spongy tissue that forms spaces of air channels), distinctly striate, it can be loose and often slips away from stem, rounded or slightly keeled towards the upper section, auricled at the mouth, smooth and glabrous. Leaf Lamina are between 15‚Äì45 cm and 0.5-2.5 cm in length and width respectively, they are linear or narrowly elliptic, acuminate, broadest in the middle, pale green or rarely glaucous, slightly flaccid, expanded or folded at the midrib, asperulous (slightly rough), has a distinct midrib visible beneath.Ligules are mostly greater than 4mm in length and up to 8mm; they are soft, rounded, truncate or somewhat acute, whitish and often split along their longitudinal axis when dried; ligules are occasionally lacerate/ glabrous.Tateoka, T. (1965) A Taxonomic Study of Oryza eichingeri and O. Punctata. Bot. Mag. Tokyo. 78, 156-163. Flowering occurs from November to April. Inflorescence panicles branch structure is spreading, 15-35 x 3‚Äì17 cm, solitary or occasionally adnate; narrow to widely elliptic or occasionally fan shaped. These panicles are erect or drooping slightly, rachides obtusely angular; glabrous or inconspicuously scaberulous, pedicels 2-5mm in length. Spikelet length and width are between 4.9-6.5mm and 1.9-2.6mm respectively (length is usually 2.5x width). Spikelets are transversely attached to the pedicel, they are asymmetrically elliptic to oblong or broadly oblong viewed laterally, glaucous/ greyish-green. Intermediate forms have been observed where it can be difficult to distinguish between O. punctata and O. eichingeri. Glumes are much reduced to a thin whitish rim. Sterile lemmas are about equal in dimensions,1-1.5mm in length, glabrous, acute and triangular. Fertile lemma are just shorter than the spikelet, they are semi-elliptic- oblong when viewed laterally, coriaceous; flanks are finely tesselate, shortly but stiffly hispid or rarely glabrous, keel and margins are ciliate, lateral apical protrusions almost always distinct. O. punctata awns are pale yellow, have rigid bristles which are straight or flexuous and commonly exceed 3 cm (2-7.5 cm) in length. Palea are shorter and thinner than the lemma, apex acute or tapering into a point. Anthers are 1.3-1.5mm long and oblong shaped with a pale violet colour. Botanically the Fruits of rice plants are known as caryopses, which here are 4-4.75mm x 1.5-1.75mm in length and width respectively; they are oblong, glabrous and pale brown. Etymology The common name for Oryza punctata Kotschy ex Steud. is Red rice. Oryza is a noun meaning rice in Late Latin (or»≥za), it has origins in Ancient Greek (√≥r≈´za) which lent from an Eastern Iranian language.Lewis, C.T., and Short, C. (1879). A Latin Dictionary, Oxford: Clarendon Press. Punctata means pointed or punctuated in Latin. The former most likely applies to this species. The synonym Oryza Schweinfurthiana Prodoehl. was published in Bot. Arch. (1922) but is not accepted.Botanisches Archiv. Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte Botanik. K√∂nigsberg and Dahlem bei Berlin. https://www.ipni.org/p/1652-2 Habitat and Ecology Oryza punctata grows in rock-pools, permanent pools near rain forest and swampy soils near streams. O. punctata is a pest plant in commercial rice cultivation in Zwaziland. The plant itself is of no use for grazing although there is some recorded use of the species for food in Kenya.Vaughan, D.A. (1994) The wild relatives of rice: a genetic resource handbook. International Rice Research Institute, Manila, Philippines O. punctata is one of two wild rice species that can be found in Madagascar. It only produces a small number of seeds and so if it is eaten at all, it is usually during a period of desperation such as a famine. Distribution Oryza punctata is distributed across tropical Africa and Madagascar as well as Thailand and other parts of Indo-China. In terms of altitude, O. punctata can be found between 33 and 1230m above sea level. O. punctata has a large geographic distribution. It is native to Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, C√¥te d 'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.Darbyshire, I., Kordofani, M., Farag, I., Candiga, R. & Pickering, H. (eds.) (2015). The Plants of Sudan and South Sudan: 1-400. Kew publishing, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Taxonomy and systematics Oryza punctata is one of over 300‚Äô000 Angiosperm plant species. O. punctata is in the Poaceae family (Grasses) belonging to a large clade known as the Monocotyledon (Monocots), which consists of 93 families. Monocots are characterised by a single cotyledon, parallel leaf venation and scattered vascular bundles.Willis, K.J. and McElwain, J.C. (2014). The Evolution of Plants. (2nd Edn). Oxford University Press, UK. 181-183pp. Earliest evidence of Monocots is based on fossil pollen and dates back to the early Aptian some 117mya as read in. Earliest grass pollen and flower fossils date back to approximately 60-55mya but Poaceae only became dominant over many other plants groups about 24 mya; this is thought to be due to cooling and drying of the environment.Kellogg, E.A. (2000). The grasses: a case study in macroevolution. Annu. Rev. Biosystem. Ecol. 31, 217-238.Chapman, G.P, (1996). The Biology of Grasses. Cambridge University Press, UK, 273p. The genus Oryza L. (Rice) diverged from the rest of Poaceae (Grasses) relatively recently, approximately 14 mya.Tang, L., Zou, X.H., Achoundong, G., Potgeiter, C., Second, G., Zhang, D.Y., Ge, S. (2010). Phylogeny and biogeography of the rice tribe (Oryzeae): Evidence from combined analysis of 20 chloroplast fragments. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution. 54, 266-277. Oryza L. originated in Asia and began to diversify, spreading to Australia, America and Africa in 3, 1 and 4 separate dispersal events respectively. Oryza L. has experienced two rapid radiation periods: the first event happened about 10 mya and the second - more recent - took place 5 mya. These two rapid radiation periods can account for the majority of diversity within the genus, the second of which lead to the emergence of Oryza punctata. Additional research is needed to investigate relationship between these radiation events and geographic dispersal events. Rice (Oryza L.) has been widely studied in systematics and many other disciplines due to its agricultural importance, making up 19% of the calories consumed worldwide every day. A taxonomic description of Oryza punctata has been provided above.Hutchinson, J., Dalzeil, J.M., Keay R.W.J., Hepper, N. (2014) Flora of West Tropical Africa (2nd edn) Crown Agents for Overseas Publishing and Administrations, Millbank, London, S. W. 1. With global populations set to reach 10 billion by 2050, it is essential to improve key crops species such as rice.Stein, J.C., Yu, Y., Copetti, D., Zwickl, D.J., Zhang, L., Zhang, C., Chougule, K., Gao, D., Iwata, A., Goicoechea, J.L. and Wei, S., 2018. Genomes of 13 domesticated and wild rice relatives highlight genetic conservation, turnover and innovation across the genus Oryza. Nature genetics, 50(2), p.285. Systematics can help play a role in identifying wild crop relatives and investigating them for useful genetic adaptations.Judd, W.S., Cambell, C.S., Kellog, E.A., Stevens, P.F., Donoghue, M.J. (2015). Plant Systematics, A Phylogenetic Approach. (4th Edn). Sinauer: Oxford University Press. While O. punctata may itself be a pest species in paddy fields, wild rice species are seen as a valuable source of useful genes which can be carried over into agricultural species. Resistance to brown planthopper (BPH) and Zigzag leafhopper (ZLH) have been seen in O. punctata, which infests commercial rice plants.Jena, K.K. (2010). The species of the genus Oryza and transfer of useful genes from wild species into cultivated rice, O. sativa . Breeding Science: 518-523. Additional Information Oryza punctata L. is listed as a species of least concern according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This means the species has been assessed and is not a focus for species conservation. However, O. punctata has been cited as a rare species in some parts of native range such as Uganda, or stated that it had a rare frequency in southern Africa.

Beginning as an assistant to the Hoapili, Governor of Maui, he served many political posts including Assistant Judge of the first Supreme Court of Hawaii, an original member of the Board of Commissioners to Quiet Land Titles, a multiple-term representative in the Hawaiian legislature and circuit judge for Maui. An early convert to Christianity and devout adherent of the Protestant faith, his first name is a Hawaiian form of the Biblical name Zerubbabel. Early life Ka ªauwai was born around 1799 or 1806, in the district of Kona on the island of Hawaii. Although not of chiefly descent, his family belonged to the \\"old class of chief's right-hand men.\\" Later historian Jon Kamakawiwo ªole Osorio stated he was a chief, of Maui lineage.; ; At a young age, he attracted the attention of Kamehameha I and later came under the patronage of High Chief Hoapili, one of Kamehameha's advisor and loyal companion and later Governor of Maui. He worked in the household of Hoapili and became his loyal subject. Later writer noted that Ka ªauwai \\"must have been an extraordinary youth to secure, as he did, the confidence and love of this old chieftain.\\" Ka ªauwai revered Hoapili as a father figure and accompanied him into battle and fought in the 1824 rebellion of Humehume, on the island of Kauai. He was present when the American missionaries, who arrived in Hawaii in 1820, established a mission station at Lahaina. After the converted Hoapili imposed a law requiring his household retainers to learn the Hawaiian alphabet or otherwise be deprived of food, the obedient Ka ªauwai abstained from food for two entire days and he learned to read and write. He and his friend David Malo became interested in Christianity at the same time and both served as early helpers to the missionaries in Lahaina, although unlike Malo, he was never licensed to preach. Under the order of Hoapili, he helped build the stone church of Kalani ªohua, on Maui.; ; With Malo, he attended the Lahainaluna became one of the first generation of Hawaiians to receive a western education by the American missionaries who arrived in Hawaii in 1820. Reginald Yzendoorn, author of History of the Catholic Mission in the Hawaiian Islands, later wrote that Ka ªauwai was a judge and Calvinist deacon who related the burning of the Roman Catholic chapel of Wailuku in 1843 to his mother-in-law Marie Leahi, an early Catholic female catechumen. In the early Hawaiian Protestant mission, deacons did not have to be licensed to preach. Ka ªauwai became an experienced fisherman, manager of the chief's canoes and an early physician. He worked as his headman or right-hand agent to Governor Hoapili and was effectively the Lieutenant Governor of Maui in all but name. In their first meeting in 1832, Reverend Richard Armstrong described how Hoapili trusted him with all his important business including accessing and collecting taxes, managing his property, and conducting tours of the island of Maui, and thus became a highly respected and well-loved official in the public view. In October 1851, the Privy Council of State, the advisory council for the king, recommended him as a candidate for the Governorship of Maui left vacant by the death of James KƒÅnehoa Young, but the council eventually voted eight to three to recommended the appointment of Prince Lot KapuƒÅiwa (the future Kamehameha V) instead. However, Prince Lot never seem to have taken up this position either because KƒÅnehoa's deputy Paul Nahaolelua remained acting governor until his own appointment in 1852.; Political career In 1842, Ka ªauwai was elected by the Hawaiian legislature to serve as one of the four Assistant Judges of the Supreme Court of Hawaii, the first formed in the Kingdom of Hawaii between 1842 and 1848, which was headed by King Kamehameha III and the Kuhina Nui KekƒÅuluohi and after her death Keoni Ana. These four judges of the Supreme Court were not Associate Justices (like later individuals appointed after 1848) but served in the capacity of an assistant to the Chief Justice, i.e. the King. He sat as a judge from 1842 to 1846, before resigning in November, 1846.; ; He was succeeded by Joshua Ka ªeo. In 1842, King Kamehameha III also appointed Ka ªauwai as one of the five original members of the Board of Commissioners to Quiet Land Titles, a government committee in charge of settling or quieting land claims of the Great MƒÅhele. He served in this post from February 10, 1846 until his resignation on March 21, 1850; an experienced attorney Joshua Kekaulahao was appointed in his place after he resigned.; ; ; ; ; Mauna Kilika, an early government building and meeting place for the Legislature of Hawaii from 1845 to 1852 According to historian Samuel Kamakau and contemporary legislative records, Ka ªauwai was one of the early \\"representatives of the people\\" who assembled with the king and the chiefs in the first session of the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom which met between April and May 1841, at Lua ªehu, in the early capital of Lahaina. Instead of a direct vote, these early representatives were appointed by recommendation from the people of the four main islands to the king.; In 1842, Kamakau replaced him as one of the two representative for Maui in the next session. Records and legislative roster from the monarchy do not list him as a representative of the other sessions of the 1840s. After the expansion of representation in the 1850s and the introduction of direct suffrage in 1851, he was elected as a member of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the legislature, and sat for four terms in the legislative assemblies of 1851, 1852, 1854 and 1855. No records exist for his representation in 1851, but he represented the district of Makawao, Maui in 1852, for Hamakua, Maui in 1854, and for Honolulu, Oahu in 1855.; ; ; ; ; ; ; Writing after his death, Reverend Jonathan Smith Green noted, \\"As a member of this body, I had the testimony of Judge Lee, often repeated, that no Hawaiian member equalled him for solid worth. Mr. Lee was Speaker once or twice when Kaauwai was a member, and knew him well. Had he lived, he would doubtless have continued to serve his generation by the will of God.\\" He served as a magistrate for Makawao. He was also a judge of the Circuit Court of Maui from April 27, 1855 until his death in August 8, 1856. Aside from politics, Ka ªauwai was a successful entrepreneur and was regarded as a \\"man of wealth\\". He acquired and accumulated extensive property in Honolulu and Maui, and according to Reverend Armstrong, who was pastor at Kawaiaha ªo Church and knew him in later life, stated \\"He did accumulate property; he had lands, houses, cattle, and money. But he did not hoard these fruits of his industry‚Äîhe gave freely to aid in every good work; gave for the support of the Gospel; aided in building meeting houses and school houses; in sending the Gospel to the heathen, and in assisting the needy.\\" On March 1849, he attempted to purchase the island of Kaho ªolawe from the King and the Land Commission. Ka ªauwai offered $400 for the entire island, which had been previously used unsuccessfully as a male penal colony. The offer was refused by the King and his Privy Council of State, and a subsequent application dated to August 18, 1854 for a fifty-year lease at $200 per year was also declined.; ; ; ; He also worked as a farmer and acquired property on Maui for growing taro and banana, which he won prizes for at the Hawaiian Agricultural Society in 1851. In later life, he became a resident of Wailuku and Makawao and was a donor and attendant of the church at Makawao, founded by Reverend Green, after developing a rift with the Wailuku Congregational Church. Falling ill while he was in Honolulu, Ka ªauwai returned to his native Maui for a change of climate which did nothing to improve his health.

First established in 1857, by 1880 it was owned by Sir Samuel Wilson went to England and selling it to Samuel McCaughey bought Toorale along with another property, Dunlop Station. The old shearing shed was built in 1873 and in 1894 about 265,000 sheep were shorn there. In 1892 the poet, Henry Lawson worked as a roustabout in the Toorale woolshed.

Early life and education Borr√†s & Mass√≥ manufacture, Matar√≥ Ram√≥n Mass√≥ Tarruella was born to an established, much branched and well-to-do Catalan bourgeoisie family. His grandfather, Ram√≥n Mass√≥ Marcer, originated from the small seaside town of Sant Pere de Ribes. In 1885, during rapid expansion of the Catalan clothing manufacturing, he moved to Barcelona to set up his own business; he started a company specializing in dyes for the textile industry (his cousin, Ram√≥n Oliveras Mass√≥, became an academic and taught chemistry in the Barcelona-based Escuela de Ingenieros Industriales until 1936). His son, Juan Mass√≥ Soler, entered the family business in 1912 and developed it into a successful chemical company. Member of many Catalan commercial and trade institutions, he married Nuria Tarruella Riu. The couple had 8 children, 3 sons (Jos√© Luis, Ram√≥n, Juan Antonio) and 5 daughters (Montserrat, Isabel, Maria Amelia, Pilar and Nuria), all raised in a profoundly Catholic and traditional ambience. In the 1950s Jos√© Luis and Juan Antonio got engaged in the family company and later turned it into Comercial Qu√≠mica Mass√≥ Sociedad An√≥nima, which expanded into new market sectors and remains active until today. In the early 1960s Juan Antonio left the family enterprise and commenced studying canon law, ordained as a priest in 1965; following his transfer to Australia he later became head (Regional Vicar) of Opus Dei there, the position retained until his death. As a child Ram√≥n together with his family fled Barcelona, the city which fell under the anarchist control during the first months of the Civil War. The family settled in San Sebasti√°n in the nationalist zone. The Mass√≥ boys joined Pelayos, the Carlist organization for older children animated mostly by the Catalan emigrees, but terminated their engagement following amalgamation of the Carlist and Falangist juvenile organizations; as a kid Mass√≥ took part in the 1937 anti-unification demonstrations, allegedly shouting \\"death to Franco\\" and \\"death to Falange\\". Following the end of hostilities the family returned to Barcelona, where Ram√≥n together with his brothers became a teenage member of the Catalan Opus Dei. In late 1940s Mass√≥ moved to Madrid studying Filosofia y Letras to graduate in Philosophy (later he became also T√©cnico en Publicidad). During his university years he joined Agrupaci√≥n de Estudiantes Tradicionalistas, a technically illegal though tolerated Carlist student organization. Enraged by increasing marginalization of Carlism within the political realm of the regime he developed his childish anti-Falangist sentiments into a firm anti-Francoist outlook. Engaged in leafleting campaigns and skirmishes against the official SEU organization, in 1954 Mass√≥ (recommended by the Carlist political leader Manuel Fal Conde) grew to the position of Delegado Nacional of AET. Aspiring Carlist Don Javier, 1960 Mass√≥ was increasingly disappointed by the perceived somnolent atmosphere of the movement's circulos, with the older generation trapped in recollections of the long gone days of glory. Highly emotional semi-clandestine 1956 attempts to dissuade the Carlist claimant from a would-be dynastical union with the Alfonsinos and to inspire him towards a decisive policy proved unsuccessful. The Mass√≥-led aetistas, upset with the diffident Don Javier, decided to focus on his eldest son Carlos Hugo, with whom the group found common ground during his brief stay in Madrid en route to Portugal in 1955. Carlos Hugo, at that time a French citizen completing PhD in economics in Oxford, threw himself into the Spanish politics in liaison with Mass√≥ and his team. Following half a year spent quietly in Bilbao on improving his castellano and learning Spanish politics (his key tutor Mass√≥ just commenced teaching at the local Colegio Gaztelueta), the prince made a public debut during the annual Carlist amassment at Montejurra in May 1957. The entry, repeatedly rehearsed, meticulously planned and pre-agreed with the Carlist leadership, turned out to be a masterpiece of public appearance. The unexpected prince's presentation generated exploding enthusiasm of the crowd, excited by youth, optimism and royal firmness of the speaker (though the lecture contained only one reference to God and included phrases sounding like an offer to Franco). Mass√≥ and his team ensured that La Proclama de Montejurra gets propagated in the Carlist circulos across Spain. In 1958 Carlos Hugo's speech ‚Äì again carefully crafted by the prince, Mass√≥ and the team ‚Äì called for profound change, put social issues on the forefront and contained a positive reference to Franco. During the following years the snowballing attendance at Montejurra transformed it from a Carlist-flavored local Via Crucis to the largest (save official, religious and football gatherings) public amassment in Francoist Spain. Carlos Hugo, 1964 The emergence of Carlos Hugo and the hugocarlistas coincided with the overall change in the Carlist strategy towards Francoism; in 1955 the intransigent Fal Conde was replaced as the movement's leader by a collective governing body, which initiated a new collaborative policy. Tactically Mass√≥ also opted for limited collaboration with Francoism (which cost him AET leadership in 1957), judging that gaining room for action is vital for his further aims. However, while the new Carlist leader Jos√© Mar√≠a Valiente sincerely hoped for some sort of prudent partnership between Francoism and Carlism, Mass√≥ aimed at dismantling the regime from within. Moreover, while Valiente oriented himself towards the army and bureaucracy, the hugocarlistas approached the hardcore syndicalist Falange sector, likewise promoting new social order and disdainful towards greedy capitalism. The collaborative approach appeared to work: in the early 1960s the Carlists were granted a few media and organizational concessions. The hugocarlistas benefited the most, opening a number of new periodicals turned into their ideological tribunes (mostly Azada y asta and Montejurra), galvanizing the chain of C√≠rculos Culturales V√°zquez de Mella and launching their own workers' organization, MOT, all of them becoming later dissemination channels of their political vision. Protagonist Carlist the Carlist standard As Carlos Hugo moved to Madrid he organized the young collaborators, dubbed camarilla and headed by Mass√≥, into his Secretar√≠a Pol√≠tica. The partnership of the old and the young leaders seemed smooth, though some of the former started suspecting the latter of dangerously Leftist ideas. Backed by the aging claimant the hugocarlistas assumed more powers as the newly established Junta de Gobierno diluted the authority of Valiente. Mass√≥ outplayed the chief opponent, Jos√© Luis Zamanillo, marginalized him in 1962‚Äì1963 and finally got him expelled early 1964. From this moment on the hugocarlistas spelled out their vision of Carlism more openly; the same year they published Esquema doctrinal, a lecture which avoided open challenge to Francoism and presented a monarchist corporative political organization combined with anti-capitalist and democratic principles. During the 1965 Montejurra the hugocarlistas voiced their praise of socialism and even Marxism at unprecedented levels. It is not clear whether Mass√≥ intended to instaurate the Carlist dynasty by means of new social mobilization or he tried to promote profound transformation using Carlos Hugo as an agent of change; anyway, the two threads became intertwined. The immediate political objective of Mass√≥ was to prevent the Alfonsist restoration. The young Carlists dogged the juanista ni√±o, boycotting or jeering Juan Carlos; they publicly humiliated the royal prince and his wife a few times. At the same time, Mass√≥ engineered a campaign to promote Carlos Hugo across the country. The operation revealed much understanding of the media role in the consumer society, as it exploited common tabloid threads and kept feeding the press with new scoops (the prince as a miner in Asturias, at a parachute course, at Sanfermines) and taking advantage of charm and youth of the prince's three sisters. The efforts proved fairly successful, as in the tightly censured media the Borbon-Parmas gained sort of nationwide positive recognition. The greatest scoop came in 1964, when Carlos Hugo married princess Irene of the Netherlands. At this point, however, the regime propaganda machine was firmly ordered to backtrack. Franco, though personally delighted that the Dutch royal family (one of the harshest critics of his regime) was publicly humiliated by a Spanish royal hopeful, grew increasingly anxious that the popularity of Carlos Hugo might get him cornered when it comes to an inescapable dynastical decision. Despite wide TV coverage across Western Europe the Spanish media played down the event, which marked hard limits of Mass√≥'s strategy and got him bitterly disappointed. In mid-1960s Mass√≥ realized that his strategy had failed; moreover, he realized that Leftist phraseology (with socialismo and autogesti√≥n most prominent catchwords) had divided and debilitated Carlism. In 1965 he loosened his ties with Carlos Hugo by moving from Madrid to Pamplona, where he commenced teaching at the Opus Dei university. As opposition against his influence mounted from the orthodox Traditionalist camp of Valiente and from the militantly Leftist group of Jos√© de Zavala, in 1966 Mass√≥ ceased as head of Secretar√≠a Pol√≠tica; in 1967 he and some of his collaborators handed their resignations and withdrew from politics. He remained loosely related to Carlism, e.g. shortly before death taking part in historical conference, Media pundit and academic IESE (contemporary view) In late 1960s Mass√≥ settled in Pamplona, working as an academic teacher at Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa (IESE), a prestigious business school founded by Opus Dei back in 1958. It was there that he completed the Alta Direcci√≥n curriculum himself, a holistic leadership program offered to top corporate managers. Finally disillusioned with Opus Dei and with its role during the process of installing Juan Carlos as the future king of Spain, Mass√≥ broke with the organization and moved to Barcelona. In his native city he joined Universidad Aut√≥noma de Barcelona (UAB), where he became catedratico in Departamento de publicidad at the Facultad de Ciencias de la Informaci√≥n. UAB library Mass√≥'s small booklet Estrategia para unas extra√±as elecciones (1977) earned him local media recognition and triggered co-operation with La Vanguardia; he became its key politics and public affairs commentator (until 1984). Mass√≥ experienced most of the Spanish transition to democracy not as a protagonist but as a witness, periodically having a regular column in the Sunday issue. As a press pundit he was careful to remain within the limits of political science and styled himself as an unbiased scholarly observer, though his hostility to Francoism and support for reforms remained evident. In general opposed to sectarian politics, he occasionally kept referring to Lenin as a political authority. His commentary suggested also that Mass√≥ sort of put up with the royal function of Juan Carlos and with his role in the Spanish transition. In late 1970s together with his former Carlist collaborator Jos√© Antonio Parilla he engaged in the Nono Art publishing house and co-ordinated work on a popular series Breu Hist√≥ria de Catalunya (1979‚Äì81). Communication expert la Caixa brand In mid-1970s Mass√≥ co-founded Alas, one of the first media agencies in Spain and became head of its Barcelona branch. About the same time he launched the term \\"politing\\", intended as a merger of \\"politics\\" and \\"marketing\\" and meant as a specialized knowledge (if not a science itself) on the crossroads of social sciences, public relations and politics. His work Introducci√≥n al ‚Äúpoliting‚Äù. Lanzamiento de un aspirante (1976), apart from gaining official prizes (Premio Markedit, Premio Instituto Nacional de Publicidad), generated also significant interest among the academics, politicians and commentators. The book was formatted as a systematic theoretical lecture on the basics of political marketing, though it contained many explicit and implicit references to the 1957‚Äì1967 political experiences of the author. Relative success of launching Carlos Hugo became one of Masso's key credentials as a scholar in public relations and as a businessman running commercial (he claims authorship of La Caixa brand) and social (e.g. cancer awareness) media campaigns. He followed with another book, De la magia a la artesan√≠a: el politing del cambio espa√±ol (1980), becoming a nationwide recognised scholar and giving courses organised by Sociedad Espa√±ola de Anunciantes, Instituto Nacional de Publicidad or Escuela Oficial de Radio y Television. communication model (sample) In the 1990s Mass√≥ switched his focus to media with El exito de la cultura light: Anuncios y noticias (1993) and Noticias frente a hechos: Entender la realidad despues de leer los periodicos (1997). Later on he broadened his interest into the wider realm of public communication, focusing on combined multidimensional holistic forms and channels of information exchange named \\"integral communication\\". He co-founded the Barcelona-based Institut de Comunicaci√≥ Integral, an independent college specializing in marketing, brand communications and public relations, and became its president. ICOMI turned out to be a commercial (though not necessarily scientific) success and became a fashionable educational institute (incorporated into Universidad Abad Oliva CEU in 2003). During the last decade Mass√≥ published successive books on culture, communications and politics: Otro rey para Espa√±a: cr√≥nica del lanzamiento y fracaso de Carlos Hugo (2004), Los √∫ltimos d√≠as de la Telecracia (with Enrique Nebot, 2009), Nacimiento y muerte de las marcas (with Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a-Lavernia Gil, 2010), Navegando por el cachondeo de la historia (2012) and even a children's book, La segunda vida de Don Jos Kintana (1999). He maintaied Twitter and Facebook accounts, scarcely active during last years of his life. Reception Juan Carlos de Borb√≥n In the 1990s, looking back on his political past, Mass√≥ admitted defeat at the hands of a competitive group of Machiavellian players coming from the same Opus Dei hotbed (especially L√≥pez Rod√≥), who outplayed him by dismantling Francoism with technocratic strategy and with Juan Carlos as a better marketed and better designed version of Carlos Hugo. He denied charges that he had implanted Marxism within the Carlist realm; he rather pointed to the Juan V√°zquez de Mella heritage, based on sociedalismo and the concept of organic society. In historiography Mass√≥ remains a rather divisive and ambiguous figure, with little agreement as to his role and intentions. Some historians (Payne, Bartyzel) maintain that he unleashed forces which either destroyed Carlism or turned it into its own antinomy. Some historians (Clemente, Martorell P√©rez) claim that he helped to safeguard Carlist identity or at least contributed to emphasizing genuine Carlism and sidetracking its accidental threads. Some historians (MacClancy, Caspistegui Gorasurreta) suggest that he commenced the process of redirecting Carlism from traditional and orthodox path to a new formula. Some historians (Perez-Nievas) do not consider Mass√≥ worth mentioning and present de Zavala as the leader of the group. According to one group of studies (Martorell P√©rez, MacClancy) Mass√≥ was primarily motivated by dynastical objectives, according to another (Clemente) he was not a monarchist at all. There are scholars (Bartyzel) who consider him a radical Leftist approximate to Marxism, there are others (Clemente) who consider him a \\"neocapitalist technocrat\\". Certain works (Martorell P√©rez, in line with Masso's own later narration) present Carlos Hugo as a politician invented and created by Mass√≥, certain works (Clemente) present Mass√≥ as Carlos Hugo's sidekick, useful at one political phase and to be replaced at the following one. Mass√≥'s departure from politics is explained by failure of his policy (Martorell P√©rez), by Carlos Hugo's decision to replace him (Clemente), by his alleged falling in love with one of Carlos Hugo's sisters (Fraga), by pressure from Opus Dei (Lavard√≠n), by combined efforts of enemies from the Right like Valiente and from the Left like de Zavala (P√©rez Madrigal) or by pure greed (Zabala). Carlist concepts over time One thing most historians agree on is that Mass√≥ proved instrumental in dismantling Traditionalist Carlism (though they do not agree whether a non- Traditionalist Carlism can actually exist). None of the currently operating Carlist grouplets admits deference to Mass√≥. Traditionalists (carloctavistas, sixtinos, CTC) tend to view him as a turncoat, the progressives (Partido Carlista, javierocarlistas) tend to view him as merely a former fellow- traveller. Before death he dedicated his future corpse to scientific research, and hence there was no funeral arranged and there is no grave. His death was acknowledged on few websites related to Partido Carlista, though not by major Spanish media.

It is a bulbous perennial, that is native to Turkey, and has blue scented flowers. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, and has many known cultivars. Description It is similar in form to Iris histrio, but with flowers a deeper shade of blue,Donald Wyman and shorter stem. It has bulbs which are coated with a solid brown fibrous network. It has leaves that grow up to high, and are squarish in cross section, thicker than in other Reticulatas. They appear after the flowers have bloomed or sometimes as they open.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) It has a very very short stem. The flower is about tall. It blooms in early spring, normally January, or February. It has flowers that vary in shade from bright blue to violet.Christopher Bricknell (Editor) Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls have a yellow signal, with many black spots, also they have a yellow ridge. The flowers can last up to a week on the plant, depending on the weather. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has been counted several times. As 2n=17 by Randolph & Mitra in 1959, 2n=16 by Johnson & Mathew in 1989 and 2n=16+1B, Johnson & Brandham in 1997. It is normal stated as 2n=16, or 2n=17. Taxonomy It is sometimes known as the 'Orchis Iris', ‚Äòwinter iris‚Äô, or 'Harput iris', after the Turkish city of Harput.Dan H. Meckenstock It was first published as Iris reticulata var. histrioides and described by G.F.Wilson in Gardeners' Chronicles ser.3 Vol.9 n page 117 in 1891. In 1892, in the 'Journal of Horticulture' Vol.III Issue 24 on page 121, Samuel Arnott republished it as Iris histrioides. The specific epithet histrioides, refers to resembling Iris histrio.D. Gledhill Iris histrioides was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 3 April 2003, then updated on 1 December 2004. Distribution and habitat It is native to Europe. =Range= It is found in Asia minor, or Turkey, near Amasya. =Habitat= It commonly grows on the mountain slopes, within pine forests, at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation It was on the 1997 IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants.Kerry Scott Walter, Harriet J. Gillett (Editors) Cultivation It is a hardy species, to between USDA Zone: 5 - 8. It is hardier than Iris histrio. But be planted in well-drained soils, to protect from summer rains, which will rot the bulb. It is suitable for a rock or gravel garden or front of border.Chester-Davis, Leah It likes rocky soils that dry out completely in summer. Once the bulb has been planted, it can take many years to reach flowering size. Also it has the habit of the main bulb splitting into many bulblets, that can take many years to reach flowering size. Grows well outside but also good in the alpine house. This species is represented in cultivation by several cultivars. Cultivars known * Iris Angel Tears' (blue with a honey mark on white ground with a small yellow vein), * Iris 'George' (purple), * Iris 'Katharine Hodgkin'(light blue standards, pale yellow falls, a 1960s hybrid of Iris histrioides and the primrose-yellow Iris winogradowii), * Iris 'Harmony' (light blue, a hybrid between I. histrioides and Iris reticulata), * Iris 'Joyce' (deep blue falls and sky blue standards), * Iris 'Lady Beatrice Stanley' (dark blue or pale-blue flowers and a mass of dark spotting on the falls), * Iris 'Major' (royal blue), * Iris 'Pauline' (light blue, a hybrid between I. histrioides and I. reticulata), Iris histrioides f. major GotBot 2016.jpgIris histrioides f. major Iris histrioides 'George' 1.jpgVariety 'Gerorge' Iris histrioides 'Katharine Hodgkin' 3.JPGVariety 'Katharine Hodgkin' Subspecies * Iris histrioides var. sophenensis also, from Turkey is deep violet-blue with little veining or spotting, narrow petals and a yellow ridge.Stuart Max Walters (Editor) Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C.

It is from Turkey in Asia. It has 2 gray-green or bluish green, thick leaves, short slender stem holding a scented flower, in shades of yellow. They are spotted olive-green or green and have a deep yellow or orange crest. Description Iris danfordiae has a narrowly ovoid, bulb,Kelly D. Norris with whitish netted coats. It has 2 leaves (per bulb), tall. They are linear, four-angled in cross section,Donald Wyman and gray-green, or bluish green. The leaves sometimes appear together with the flowers, and sometimes after the flowers. It has a slender stem, that can grow up to between tall. They hold 1 flower each. It is one of the first reticulata irises to bloom,Christine Skelmersdale even blooming through the snow.Diana Beresford- Kroeger In early spring, between January, and March. It has fragrant (scented of honey,) flowers,Martyn Cox in shades of yellow. From bright yellow, deep yellow, to orange. The flowers are in diameter. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are spathulate (spoon shaped), and spotted olive-green, or green. In the centre of the falls is a deep yellow or orange crest. The standards are vert short, in some cases just bristles. Later after flowering, it produces a seed capsule. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It was counted in 1959 by Randolph & Mitra as 2n=27, then in 1997 by Johnson & Brandham as 2n=18 and 27. Taxonomy thumb It is pronounced as (Iris) EYE- ris (aphylla) dan-FORD-ee-ay (danfordiae). It is commonly known as dwarf iris, buttercup Iris, or Danford's iris.John Greenlee This species was introduced from Cilicia, Turkey in 1876, by Mrs C. G. Danford (an English plant hunter of the Asia minor regions). It was first published and described as Xiphion danfordiae Baker and described by John Gilbert Baker in J. Bot. Vol.14 n page 265 in 1876. It was then reclassified and published as Iris danfordiae by Pierre Edmond Boissier in 'Fl. Orient.' Vol.5 on page 124 in July 1882. Iris danfordiae is an accepted name by the RHS, and it was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 23 January 1989, then updated on 2 December 2004. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate Asia, mainly Asia Minor. =Range= It grows in the Taurus Mountains of southern Turkey. =Habitat= It grows on exposed dry rocky and sunny slopes, at the edges of coniferous forests or woods, close to the snowline. It is normally found at an altitude of above sea level. Cultivation thumb It is cold hardy, to between USDA Zones 5 - 9. It is sometimes deemed less reliably perennial than other bulbs. It prefers to grow in neutral to alkaline soils, which are high in potassium and phosphate. It prefers sandy and well drained soils both in summer and winter. It prefers positions in full sun. It is suitable for a rock or gravel garden or front of border.Leah Chester-Davis During mild season the bulb and plant is susceptible to slug damage. =Propagation= It can be propagated by division or by seed growing. Seeds are best grown by collecting dry, mature seed capsules, and sowing the seeds. Division, is carried out by lifting the main bulb and splitting into many bulblets, that (once replanted) can take many years to reach flowering size. This is best carried out when the foliage has died down.David Squire The bulbs should be planted deeply to flower reliably in later seasons. =Hybrids and cultivars= Iris danfordiae has the following cultivars: 'Atilla', 'Bornm√ºlleri', 'Danfordiae Hort'. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske References Other sources * Ald√©n, B., S. Ryman, & M.

Home-grown opera companies both professional and amateur began forming in the 19th century. In 1843 a purpose built theatre for the performance of Italian opera was established in Bucharest. Its inaugural performance was Bellini's Norma. Opera was also performed by the students at the conservatory established by The Philharmonic Society of Bucharest. By the early 19th century, works by native Romanian composers began to be performed, although usually with librettos in German (or occasionally Hungarian). The notion of a Romanian national opera tradition emerged in the mid-19th century with the appearance of operas on Romanian subjects, often based on historical events, with Romanian-language librettos.Grout, Donald Jay and Williams, Hermine Weigel (2013). A Short History of Opera, p. 538. Columbia University Press. The country's principal national opera company, Romanian National Opera, Bucharest (Opera Na»õionalƒÉ Bucure»ôti), had its roots in the formation of the Opera Society (Societatea Opera). In 1921 under the patronage of Queen Maria and Octavian Goga the society became a state institution with state funding. Their inaugural performance was on 8 December 1921 with George Enescu conducting the Bucharest premiere Wagner's Lohengrin.Opera Na»õionalƒÉ Bucure»ôti.

Built in the 13th and 14th century, the church underwent major changes during a renovation at the turn of the 19th‚Äì20th centuries. Dalhem Church lies in the Diocese of Visby of the Church of Sweden. History The very first church on the site was a stave church, now vanished. This was followed by small stone church on the same site. This church, probably Romanesque in style, seems to have had a choir with an apse. In the presently visible church, the choir and nave are the oldest parts, dating from the 13th century. The tower, the main portal and the large window on the western fa√ßade date from the 14th century. The construction was led by Cistercian monks from nearby Roma Abbey. The church was subsequently left more or less unchanged, with only some furnishings - notably, the carved wooden pulpit (1637) - being added later. In 1899 a major renovation of the church started, which to a large degree transformed the church. Renovation A corner of the interior, showing parts of the murals painted in 1899-1914\\\\. In 1899 a renovation of the church began. Architect and artist Axel Haig (known in Sweden as Axel Herman H√§gg, 1835‚Äì1921) collected money, also internationally, for the thorough undertaking. The work continued for fifteen years, until 1914. The church was substantially altered both externally and internally, in an attempt to make the church appear even more medieval. The renovation was considered remarkable at the time, and led to the church being called the \\"national shrine of Gotland\\". Today, the renovation has been described instead as a \\"harsh and loose reconstruction of the Middle Ages\\". It remains a clear example of the ideas of cultural heritage conservation prevalent at the time. Architecture The church consists of three distinct parts: the tower, nave and choir. The tower, which reaches over is adorned with galleries, an influence of art from the Rhine valley and topped with a form of spire known as a Rhenish helm. The main portal, on the south fa√ßade, is decorated with carved stone sculptures with motifs unusual for Gotland (14th century). In the wall adjacent to the northern portal, a tombstone originating from the earlier stone church has been immured. The exterior of the church has been whitewashed but the underlying limestone was laid bare during the 1899-1914 renovation. Inside, the church is completely dominated by the changes made in 1899-1914, but among the later additions there are several original, medieval details. The church for example has the oldest preserved stained glass windows on Gotland (made by a German artisan), but to these have been added complementing windows in medieval style during the 1899-1914 renovation. Several medieval murals also survive, depicting e.g. the crucifixion and the archangel Michael. The walls are however dominated by the many paintings made by Haig during the renovation. A niche intended to house the bread and wine of the Eucharist, is actually a surviving fragment from the earlier, Romanesque church. The church also has a processional cross from the 14th century and a baptismal font from the 12th century, but almost all of the other furnishings stem from the great renovation of the church. A minor renovation was carried out again in 1969, and it was then decided that the church should be kept in the condition it was after the 1899-1914 renovation.

He was born in Ankara, Turkey in 1960. He is the principal and founder of GAD in Istanbul, established in 1994. At GAD (Global Architectural Development), Avcƒ±oƒülu has completed a number of projects of varying function and size in Turkey and regionally. Early life and education Celal G√∂khan Avcƒ±oƒülu was born in Ankara, Turkey to Selahattin Avcƒ±oƒülu, a bureaucrat and Y√ºcel Avcƒ±oƒülu, n√©e Erkul, a housewife. He has one sister, Serihan Avcƒ±oƒülu, who is an economist. His parents met in the Hacettepe district of Ankara while his family's roots can be traced back to Istanbul and Albania on his father's side and Istanbul, Bosnia and Thessaloniki (Selanik) in the Balkans on his mother's. His father worked as a bureaucrat for the Turkish State Railways, (T√ºrkiye Cumhuriyeti Devlet Demiryollarƒ±), and the family often travelled throughout Turkey that included visits to archaeological sites such as the Greco-Roman city of Ephesus in the Mediterranean and Aegean coasts that became an inspiration for his interest in architecture. He went to high school in Istanbul at Boƒüazi√ßi Lisesi in Baltalimani from 1974-77 with his youth primarily spent in the Kuzguncuk district of √úsk√ºdar on the Asian side of the city. During his time living in Kuzguncuk he was able to witness the construction of the Bosphorus Bridge in the adjacent district of Beylerbeyi that motivated his curiosity for structure and structural engineering. During his time as a high school student, his interest in art and architecture brought him to take classes in sculpture at Istanbul's Fine Arts Academy - ƒ∞stanbul Devlet G√ºzel Sanatlar Akademesi now known as Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University. In construction he was influenced by the work of the many \\"Design Build\\" architects working as building contractors in Turkey in the 1970s including spending time as an intern on the construction sites of his uncle, the architect and construction contractor Tandoƒüan Erkul. Throughout his career Avcƒ±oƒülu in addition to his architectural practice would have key relationships with Turkey's contractors and builders seeking to advance economic and operational models for construction. He was accepted to the ƒ∞stanbul Develt G√ºzel Sanatlar Akademesi in 1977 and after briefly attending architecture school in Edirne, Turkey, he would instead go on to start and complete his education in architecture at Sel√ßuk University in Konya at a distance from Istanbul. Part of the reason for his decision to pursue architectural education in Konya was that it was a relatively calmer setting in a tumultuous time in Turkish history that included the urban conflicts of the Political violence in Turkey (1976‚Äì1980) and the succeeding 1980 Turkish coup d'√©tat. He eventually graduated with a professional degree in architecture in 1983 during an extended 7 year tenure. Towards the end of his architectural education he worked as an intern with Turkish modernist architect Cengiz Bekta≈ü from 1981 to 1983 who was also based in Kuzguncuk, Istanbul, and later started a practice Mimarlik Hizmetleri Ltd from 1990-1994 with the architect Nevzat Sayƒ±n whom he had met during his time at the office of Bekta≈ü. He was active in the milieu of architects and archaeologists in Bekta≈ü's circle which prompted him to explore Central Anatolia in detail including Cappadoccia. Later he would go further east, intrepidly hitchhiking on his own through Turkey to the Iranian regions of Khorasan and Isfahan on the Silk Road ending up in Samerkand in Uzbekistan. The end of his student days was marked by his internship on the restoration project of the Uzbek Sufi Lodge in √úsk√ºdar, Istanbul, where he worked closely with the traditional carpenter craftsman, Eyup usta, on the complete reconstruction of the historical timber Ottoman building financed in part by the Turkish-American businessman, Ahmet Erteg√ºn. This experience with traditional building would also be a trajectory he would pursue in his professional practice. Career Avcƒ±oƒülu is the founder and has been the principal of Global Architectural Development (GAD) since 1994. Avcƒ±oƒülu taught at the √âcole Sp√©ciale d'Architecture in Paris. His projects include residences, office and hotel buildings, cultural, public and commercial spaces in Istanbul, Bodrum, New Jersey, New York City, Washington, D.C., Virginia, Connecticut, Libya, Beirut, Riyadh, and Kiev.

It is located next to St. Anne's Church. Dedicated to Saints Francis of Assisi and Bernardino of Siena, it is an important example of Gothic architecture in Lithuania. History Interior After their arrival in Vilnius, Bernardine monks built a wooden church in the second half of the 15th century, and at the end of the same century - a brick one. In the early 16th century it was reconstructed, apparently with the participation of a master from Gdansk (Danzig) Michael Enkinger. In the beginning of the 16th century the church was incorporated into the construction of Vilnius defensive wall, so there are shooting openings in its walls. Afterwards it was renewed many times, particularly after the 1655-61 war with Moscow, when the Cossacks ravaged the church killing the monks and citizens who had taken shelter there. In the times of the Soviet occupation it was closed down and handed over to the Art institute. In 1994, the brethren of St. Francis returned to the church. According to the legend, the Bernardine monks used to tell such good sermons that crowds would come to listen. That is why the church is so large. Architecture Church and Monastery are some of the largest sacral buildings in Vilnius, although in the 17th and 18th centuries they acquired the Renaissance and Baroque features. Being much larger and more archaic than the St. Anne's Church, it forms and interesting and unique ensemble with the latter. Gothic pointed-arch windows and buttresses stand out on the fa√ßade. Above them rises a pediment with twin octagonal towers on the sides and a fresco depicting the Crucifix in the middle niche. A Gothic presbytery is the oldest part of the church. Eight high pillars divide the church interior into 3 naves. There are many valuable 16th-century wall paintings in Bernardine church and the oldest known artistic Lithuanian crucifix sculpture from the 15th century. The walls of the naves are decorated with Gothic polychrome frescoes, partly uncovered in 1981 - dynamic, colourful figural compositions on biblical and hagiographic themes, with occasional inscriptions in Gothic characters, floral ornaments, heraldic insignia etc. These mural paintings date from the early 16th century and are considered unique in the world: their composition and type of presentation of the subject matter belongs to Renaissance, and the stylistics - to the Gothic style.Prof. Tomas Venclova. VILNIUS; R. Paknys Publishing House, The Bernardine monastery north of the church, built simultaneously with the church, was renovated and reconstructed several times. Since its founding, a novitiate and a seminary operated at the monastery, a rich library had been accumulated, and a scriptorium operated. There artists, craftsmen and organists among the monks. The monastery was closed in 1864, and the building housed soldiers' barracks. In 1919 it was given to the art faculty of the university, later - to the Art Institute (now the Art Academy).

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Greeley House is located on the north side of New Hampshire Route 108, just a few feet from the roadway, at a point where it bends, mainly to avoid the house. It is a 2¬Ω-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide on the first floor and three on the second. The entrance is at the center, framed by a modest surround with a peaked lintel. The rear roof line extends to the first floor, giving the house a saltbox profile, and there is a shed-roof addition on the east side which was added in the 1960s. A gabled dormer projects from the rear roof face. The house is believed to have been built in 1718 by Joseph Greeley. Its prominent location along the major east‚Äìwest route through the town (between Kingston and Seabrook) has made it a landmark in the town for many years.

Jailbait images can be differentiated from child pornography as jailbait images do not usually contain nudity. Jailbait depicts tween or young teen girls in skimpy clothing such as bikinis, short skirts, or underwear. The online distribution of jailbait images has caused legal and moral controversy, in some cases leading to the censorship of both the images and the word itself as a search term. Legality, censorship and online impact The legal status of jailbait images is controversial. When questioned regarding their legality, legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin stated he thought it was not illegal, though legal expert Sunny Hostin was more skeptical, describing jailbait images as \\"borderline\\" child pornography which may be illegal. While the images may be legal, they are often considered to be in poor taste. Jailbait is amongst the list of banned hashtags at the photo- sharing website Instagram, and the social networking website Tumblr. The term is also blocked on Google Instant. Jailbait images have been defended on the grounds of free speech, and have also been defended on the grounds they are similar to mainstream sexualised images of minors, such as those in the music video for \\"...Baby One More Time\\" by Britney Spears, who was 16 years old at the time of filming. Jailbait images are often collected directly from girls' Facebook pages. Numerous webpages and forums are devoted to jailbait images. As well as uploading and sharing images, popular discussion topics at jailbait communities include ephebophilia, the difference between ephebophilia and pedophilia, and debating whether images of certain girls are too young or old to be classified as jailbait. Vice magazine commented on the lack of attention the press paid to the role popular jailbait image boards had on the suicide of Amanda Todd. An individual who was alleged to be harassing Todd prior to her suicide was tracked down by posts and images he uploaded to jailbait forums on the Internet. They also describe online jailbait communities as \\"a very insidious force on the Internet that is pitting overly clever pedophiles against insecure teenagers.\\" They have also been said to \\"offer a window into a disturbing mindset.\\" Self-identified pedophiles can be found in jailbait communities. =Reddit controversy= The most infamous online jailbait community was the subreddit section \\"/r/jailbait\\" on the website Reddit. It was the first result when searching for \\"jailbait\\" on Google, and was at one point the second largest search term that brought visitors to Reddit, topped only by the word \\"Reddit\\" itself. The jailbait subreddit received widespread attention after Anderson Cooper devoted a segment of his TV program on September 29, 2011, to condemning both the subreddit itself and Reddit for hosting it. On October 10, 2011 the subreddit was shut down by Reddit administrators.

Mason J. Young House, also known as the William Boyd House, is a historic house and connected farm complex at 4 Young Road in Londonderry, New Hampshire. With a building history dating to 1802, it is a well-preserved example of a New England connected farmstead. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Gen. Mason J. Young House is located just off Londonderry's commercial area of New Hampshire Route 102, at the corner of Young Road and Cross Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a gable roof and a central chimney. It is five bays wide and three deep with a columned portico (c. 1900) sheltering its front entry, and a single-story porch (dating to the mid-19th century) extending along the side. The interior has well-preserved period woodwork. A two-story wing extends to the rear of the house, which is further extended by a series of sheds connecting the house to a carriage house and dairy barn. The main house is reported by family accounts to have been built in 1802, on a farm that was in active use since 1757. The land was first settled by Mason Boyd, and the house was built by William Boyd. Originally a subsistence farm, it was transformed into a dairy farm in the mid-19th century, delivering milk and other products to Boston by railroad.

Anar Mammadli (full name Mammadli Anar Asaf oglu - born 1978 in Yevlakh) city, Azerbaijan Republic.He is a prominent human rights activist in Azerbaijan. Anar Mammadli is active in observing and monitoring elections, and repeatedly criticized the conduct of elections by the authorities in Azerbaijan. On 16 December 2013, Mammadli was arrested and jailed, following outspoken criticism of presidential elections in October 2013. In spite of international protests, A. Mammadli was sentenced to more than 5 years in jail, in May 2014. On 29 September 2014, while still in detention, Mammadli was awarded the V√°clav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which honours \\"outstanding\\" action in defence of human rights. Activism Mammadli began his activism in the late 1990s. In 1997 he established the Secular Progress Youth Organization together with Bashir Suleymanli and other young co-founders. In 2001, Anar Mammadli participated in setting up the Election Monitoring Center. Five months before the Azerbaijani Presidential Elections in 2008, the registration of this organization was cancelled by the Khatai District Court on May 14, 2008 based on a technicality in official filings. In response, Anar Mammadli and Bashir Suleymanli established the Election Monitoring and Democracy Studies Center (EMDS) in December 2008. Mammadli's organization is a member of the European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations (ENEMO), European Platform for Democratic Elections (EPDE), Network of Parliament Monitoring Organizations and the Civil Society Forum of the Eastern Partnership Program of the European Union, and Mammadli participated in numerous election observations internationally. In addition to his activism, Mammadli has worked as a journalist, holding a variety of positions as newspaper reporter, commentator, editor and assistant to the editor in chief at ‚ÄúMerkez‚Äù(\\"Center\\"), ‚ÄúHurriyet‚Äù (\\"Freedom\\"), and ‚ÄúBug√ºn‚Äù (\\"Today\\"), from 1998-2002. Arrest After vocal criticism of the presidential elections held on 9 October 2013, the EMDS found itself under increasing pressure. In its report on the elections, the EMDS had highlighted a series of irregularities, saying that conditions for a free and democratic vote had not been met. Shortly after EMDS published its report, the General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan opened a criminal case against Mammadli and he was arrested on 16 December 2013. On 26 May 2014,A. Mammadli was sentenced to 5 years and 6 months by the decision of Baku Grave Crimes Court. Mammadli was charged with illegal entrepreneurship, tax evasion, abuse of official authority to influence on the results of election, charges rejected by Mammadli and his lawyers. The trial and sentence was criticized by many international organizations and human rights groups. Amnesty International Organization considers Anar Mammadli to be a prisoner of conscience, and a number of countries have called for his release. In September 2014, Mammadli was awarded the V√°clav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). With this award, the Council of Europe wants to honour \\"outstanding civil society action in defence of human rights\\". Mammadli is a graduate from the Azerbaijan University of Languages.

Retrieved August 4, 2014. in conjunction with The Onions decision to stop its print edition and shift its focus exclusively to the internet. According to ClickHole's senior editor, Jermaine Affonso, the website \\"is The Onion's response to click-bait content\\" and serves as \\"a parody of online media\\". Critics noted that, on a deeper level, ClickHole illustrates the shallow nature of social media content and media sites' desperation to share such content. On February 3, 2020, the website was acquired by the team behind Cards Against Humanity. After the purchase, the website's employees became its majority owners, and will retain complete creative control. As a result of the purchase, the website went on hiatus from February 3 to May 20. Background ClickHole aims to mock content posted on media sites, using satire, and tries to make its content shareable. According to its website, ClickHole wants \\"to make sure that all of [its] content panders to and misleads [its] readers just enough to make it go viral\\". In most of its posts, ClickHole tries to convey an underlying message, usually poking fun at social media users or societal behaviors. The website aims to publish content frequently, setting a target of 7‚Äì10 new posts daily. Content ClickHole publishes content in the form of articles, videos, quizzes, blogs, slideshows, and features. Since being founded in June 2014, ClickHole has published parodies of nostalgic content, advice, motivational quotes, sport analysis, life hacks, fashion, and think- pieces (all of which mimic the style and tone of content posted by media sites such as Buzzfeed and Upworthy). Another popular feature is \\"oral histories\\" of TV shows, websites, and other usually very recent pop culture phenomena. The ClickHole team meets frequently to brainstorm about new ideas and topics that can be written about. The team uses social media feeds as inspiration for topics to satirize, based on the clickbait that is shared most often. ClickHole ensures that its employees put detail into how each topic should be addressed from a satirical point of view, so that its ideas are conveyed successfully. It also was revealed that the team is still at a stage where it is experimenting with ideas to see what is best received by its audience. Content posted on ClickHole also is shared on social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, and Pinterest. In February 2015, ClickHole began posting interactive fiction adventure games called ClickVentures. On February 23, 2017, ClickHole temporarily changed its name to Cruft. The change was unexplained, and the name was changed back the following day. On May 17, 2017, ClickHole was changed to PatriotHole, declaring itself to be \\"the only viral media site brave enough to SCREAM about REAL Americans\\" and \\"the internet‚Äôs last stand against the tyranny of the Leftist Media.\\" As PatriotHole, the site's journalistic style shifted to resemble fringe right wing news websites such as Breitbart and InfoWars. The site's logo was changed from an orange spiral pattern to a white eagle with orange lines spanning between its wings. Two days later, the site changed back to normal, although PatriotHole was spun off into its own section. On August 29, 2017, PatriotHole introduced Doug Baxter as the host of its eponymous web video series which premiered on September 6, 2017. The show features Baxter as a parody of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, parodying Jones's views on subjects like Hillary Clinton, globalists, 9/11 conspiracy theories, and products sold through the InfoWars website. On May 9, 2018, ClickHole launched a new liberal-themed site called ResistanceHole, which has a similar theme to PatriotHole but targets liberal news media in its satire, and 'attacks' figures like Donald Trump and Mike Pence (as opposed to PatriotHole, which targets ones like Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders). Reception Within the first week of release, some readers criticized ClickHole for what they saw as a lack of originality. It was accused of using Upworthy, The Huffington Post and Buzzfeed for inspiration for its headlines, slideshows, and quizzes respectively. One hundred days after its launch, Fast Company praised the site, saying it was \\"earning praise from just about every corner of the Internet\\", with 36% web traffic generated via sharing on Facebook. The format established by ClickHole is being emulated by some campus satirical newspapers, such as The Michigan Every Three Weekly and The Georgetown Heckler with their spin-off. Various writers predicted that the website will be a long-term success because its content has consistently been creative and targets a wide audience. They assumed this to be the case as long as ClickHole's audience understand that the website parodies clickbait, and is not clickbait in itself. Sam Parker of The Guardian said it was unclear whether ClickHole is \\"a satire of clickbait, or good satire done as clickbait\\". Many users of social media have taken ClickHole articles to be literal (especially those addressing controversial topics), and have expressed their anger and confusion online. =Celebrity recognition= Actor and director George Takei mentioned the website on his official Facebook account after the ClickHole team published an article dedicated to him (\\"10 Things We Hope George Takei Likes Enough To Share This List\\") and repeatedly tried to contact him through social media. In another instance, the Facebook account of Robert Downey, Jr. posted a link to the article \\"What Robert Downey Jr. Would Look Like Today,\\" which had the satirical premise of the actor having died several years ago and stating, \\"I always try to defy expectations.\\" Writer and comedian B.J. Novak tweeted in March 2018 that the writers at ClickHole \\"are doing brilliant work.\\" After falling for a fake quote attributed to him on ClickHole, Anderson Cooper dedicated the \\"Ridiculist\\" segment of the May 20, 2015, episode of Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ to the website.

In August 1942, it was commanded by Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá, and was the largest and the most elite military unit of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá at that time.  Establishment and initial structure  The Lim-Sand≈æak Chetnik Detachment was established by Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá, based on an agreement between ƒêorƒëe La≈°iƒá and Italian General Alessandro Pirzio Biroli signed on 24 July 1942 after about two months of negotiations. The agreement \\"legalised\\" the detachment with the Italian occupying forces. Chetniks that had not been \\"legalised\\" were much more numerous and important. The Italians tolerated groups of illegal Chetniks and gave them the status of a \\"national peasants' militia\\". The Lim-Sand≈æak Chetnik Detachment was a mobile unit consisting of four battalions, one for each region within the sector. Bijelo Polje, Berane, Andrijevica and Kola≈°in had one battalion each. According to the agreement, the detachment was authorised to a strength of 1,500 men who received a salary, food, clothes and arms from the Italians.  Expansion  On 12 July 1942, Chetnik headquarters met in Zimonjiƒáa Kula to decide about the allocation of Chetnik commands and areas of responsibility, and Montenegro was divided into western and eastern sectors. Bajo Stani≈°iƒá was appointed as the commander of the western sector, while Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá was appointed as the commander of the eastern sector, which matched the existing territory of his detachment. At a further conference held the following month, ƒêuri≈°iƒá's sector was expanded to include Prijepolje, Priboj, Nova Varo≈° and Sjenica. After this expansion the Lim- Sand≈æak Chetnik Detachment was reorganized into four corps: * Kom Corps * Lim Corps * Mile≈°eva Corps It was planned to include Deƒçane Corps, consisting of three brigades (Peƒá, Istok and Drenica) as part of the detachment, but this plan remained only on paper. According to Chetnik documents, the Lim-Sand≈æak Chetnik Detachment had 200 officers and 15,349 men available for military service. They were armed with 13,116 rifles, 51 light machine guns, 15 machine guns and 5 mortars. The Italians also authorised ƒêuri≈°iƒá to raise a gendarmerie in his sector, which was used to terrorise members and supporters of the Partisans and the population in general.  Battles  The detachment participated in the Third Enemy Offensive against the Partisans. In the middle of May 1943, prior to the formal commencement of Case Black, around 2,000 men from this detachment, including ƒêuri≈°iƒá, were captured by German forces. Vojislav Lukaƒçeviƒá succeeded ƒêuri≈°iƒá as the commander of the remaining men of the detachment.

Whenever Allah wishes to speak by way of revelation, the Tablet comes in contact with the forehead of Israfil, then he looks into it and reads what is in it. Israfil would then convey it to Mika'il and he in turn would convey it to Gabriel, and the angel Gabriel, would convey it to the prophets, on whom be peace. And as for the fainting fit which would come upon the Prophet, it used to take place at the time of Allah's addressing him by reason whereof he would also feel a heaviness and perspire. But Gabriel, on account of respect for the Prophet, would never enter his presence until he sought permission, and he used to sit before him (the Prophet) in the manner of a slave.

Although a live event (with just one brief break) The Battle of Orgreave was filmed in real time by Hollywood director Mike Figgis for Channel 4's programme of the same name. With a minimum of direction, Figgis' camera crews recorded the action as it unfolded around them, resulting in footage that is very similar to that taken during the actual clash in 1984. Other events include The Roman Army and Chariot Experience (RACE) in Jerash, Jordan in 2005, and ancient to modern era and multi-period shows for the Army Benevolent Fund, British army and others.

He is considered one of the fathers of Bulgarian and Romanian anarchism. Biography The son of Ivancho Stoyanov, a Bulgarian active militant for national liberation from Rouss√©, and Gabriela von Walter, a German woman, Paraskev was born on January 30, 1871 in the city of Giurgiu, Romania, where his father had fled to escape persecution from the Ottomans. Belonging to a wealthy environment, Paraskev Stoyanov enjoyed a solid education, he studied at Bucharest's \\"Saint Sava\\" high school and at medical universities in Romania, France and Switzerland. After primary school in Bucharest, he adhered to socialist ideas through high school, then to anarchism after reading Peter Kropotkin's pamphlet \\"An Appeal To The Young\\". Thus, in high school, he founded book clubs for students studying socialism and anarchism and began to spread anarchism among the workers in Romania, coming to be considered the \\"father\\" of anarchism in the country. He translated into Romanian Errico Malatesta's numerous pamphlets, including \\"For The Voters\\", \\"Between Peasants \\" and \\"Anarchy\\". In 1890, he went to perfect his studies of medicine in Paris, and took part in an international conference of students and the publication of a libertarian manifesto with Italian libertarian socialist Francesco Saverio Merlino. Arrested the same day, then released on bail a few months later, he moved to Italy, then found refuge for a time in Switzerland, where he met the leading theorists of the anarchist movement: Peter Kropotkin and √âlis√©e Reclus. After graduating in medicine at W√ºrzburg, Germany (1895), he became a professor of surgery in the first propaedeutics Medical Faculty in Sofia and wrote the first textbooks on surgery. In 1895, as a medical student, Stoyanov climbs Mt. Grand Combin, Switzerland, reaching 4318 m, and was greeted by Aleko Konstantinov, who is considered a pioneer of Bulgarian alpinism. This is the first documented ascent of a Bulgarian to a height greater than 4000 m. Stoyanov lived and worked in Varna between 1905 and 1918. There he established the Children Sea Sanatorium for Tuberculosis of Bones and Joints which was the only one of its kind on the Balkan Peninsula. Originally it was located in inadequate sheds in the area of \\"Karantinata\\". In the sanatorium were admitted children from 3 to 15 years of age from all over Bulgaria with no differentiation in their social status. From all the children under treatment 95% either improved their condition or were fully recovered. Prof. Dr. Stoyanov gained a worldwide recognition as one of the founders of Thalassotherapy (Seawater Therapy) and Heliotherapy (Sun Treatment). He urged persistently, \\"Bulgarians should turn to the sea and start using its values!\\" Today, the founder of Bulgarian surgery - Professor Dr. Paraskev is namesake of the Medical University of Varna and Multi-profile Hospital for Active Treatment in Lovech. Streets in Pomorie and Varna bear his name.

Founder of a group of Mexican companies, such as Reliance de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., and Potencia Industrial, S.A.  Early years  His father, Enrique Guillermo Gottfried Zender, born in Peru to American parents, was an electrical engineer who had come to Mexico City in 1910 with the Westinghouse Company from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1918 he married Maria Guti√©rrez Zertuche, a Mexican citizen, whose parents and grandparents were officers of the Mexican Army. During his early years, Mario Gottfried attended the American School in Mexico City. Later, his father was offered a job in the German Siemens Electrical Company in the US, and the family moved in 1926 to New York City, where he grew up until the age of twenty-one.  Military career  Mario Gottfried during his flight training in 1942. In 1940, while attending Pratt Institute of Technology in New York, he applied to enter the USA Army Air Corps. Meanwhile, in early 1941, he joined the Army Infantry Center at Camp Upton, in Long Island, and at Camp Eustis, Virginia. During a stopover at Fort Shafter, Hawaii, on the way to the Philippines, he received his acceptance into the aviation cadet training program at Allan Hancock College of Aeronautics in Santa Maria, California. During his training at Air Force Bases in Merced, California, and Luke, Arizona, he used to fly BT-13's, P-36's and P-40's, for graduating later as a fighter pilot in April 1942.

He served in Alaska 11th Fighter Squadron and, between 1942 and 1943, was continually transferred between the 42 ¬∫ and 54 ¬∫ Troop Carrier Squadrons. Gottfried logged over one thousand hours of flight time during his missions in places like Naknek, Nome, Bethel, Dutch Harbor and the Aleutian Islands in the C45 (DC3). In 1943, he was awarded the Air Medal and Distinguished Flying Cross at the Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, for his great performance as a transport pilot in the Aleutian Islands during World War II. Between 1944 and 1945, he was assigned to different U.S. Air Force Bases: Baer Field, Indiana; Grenada, Mississippi; Bergstrom in Austin, Texas; and then to Sedalia, Missouri. During his service in Sedalia, while he was instructor of instructors, he met Martha Joy Young and got married on January 29, 1945, in Glendale, Arizona. In late 1945, he retired from the U.S. Air Force, although years later he became president of the Air Force Reserve Officer Association in Mexico City and an active member of the Air Force Association.

In 1945, Mario Gottfried moved to Mexico City, where he collaborated with the business plan of his father, Enrique Gottfried, now a representative of American electrical manufacturers in Mexico. After the preliminary success, in 1958 they began to manufacture electric motors and generators as Reliance de Mexico, S.A., under the supervision of the Reliance Electric Company of Cleveland, Ohio. His brother, Gustavo C. Gottfried, also ex-aviator of World War II, joined them. Placement of a \\"Colibr√≠\\". President Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo with Mario H.

In 1968 they produced more power-generating equipment as Potencia Industrial, S.A., and in the early 70's, his children Mario and Carlos joined the company. Years later, the firm grew from making small motors of 1 to 50 horsepower (HP), to huge industrial motors and generators up to 10,000 HP. The enterprise also became a benchmark for wind and hydro-power industry, and uninterruptible power systems, after several patents in these technologies; as in the case of the \\"Hummingbird\\" or \\"Colibr√≠\\", a permanent magnet generator of 5 and 10 kilowatts (kW), in commerce since 1975. According to various publications, is \\"the first Mexican wind turbine, besides being a global pioneer in permanent magnet direct drive generators.\\" By 1980, close to 600 units were exported to the United States and Canada. The company, led by Mario Gottfried, continued to thrive in their operations until 1982, when the initial achievements were threatened by a severe financial crisis in Mexico that affected the industrial sector, which became even more acute with the process of economic aperture in 1988. The company manages to survive and in the early nineties continued to push ahead with manufacturing innovations, and celebrating contracts with recognized companies, such as Electric Products Company of Cleveland, Ohio; Alternative Energy Institute (AEI); Louis Allis Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Zond and Enron Wind; Federal Electricity Commission (CFE); Petr√≥leos Mexicanos (Pemex); and more.

The company was officially named One to One (North West) Ltd. On 29 July 2019, Joanne Parkington informed her staff the company would cease trading on 31 July 2019. The company signed a contract to provide midwifery services with NHS Wirral in November 2011. The company provided a single midwife to see women through antenatal care, birth and postnatal care. Midwives working for the company were allowed to go into NHS hospitals to act as advocates of support if the woman chooses a hospital birth. One to One Midwives had a 33% home birth rate, compared to the National average of 2%. They aimed to ensure continuity of care. Expectant mothers felt safer giving birth during the 1950s because they had one midwife looking after them throughout their pregnancy, according to Heidi Thomas, writer of hit television show Call The Midwife. It was alleged that the company misled women about their low rates of intervention, instrumental deliveries, Caesarean sections and stillbirths because those women were transferred to hospital for assistance when there was a problem. One to One Midwives were available across Essex and the Northwest of England under Any Qualified Provider rules. In November 2017 the company celebrated the birth of its 10,000th baby since starting in 2011 on the Wirral. More than 30% were born at home. Two of their midwives were shortlisted for the 2019 MaMa awards. Controversy In October 2014, after the death of two babies, it was reported that NHS England had launched an investigation led by Trafford Clinical Commissioning Group. Andrew Gwynne MP, from Labour's shadow health team, said it was vital that the results were made public. He said that private providers are not subject to Freedom of Information laws. ‚ÄúIf they are providing a public service, with public funds, for the benefit of the public, they should not be outside of scrutiny\\". The company claims that the report by the Manchester Evening News was misleading. The babies were born in hospital and died of natural causes, one at a few days old and one at a few weeks. The review performed by the Greater Manchester Clinical Commissioning Groups was not an investigation into the deaths but a quality review on the service that they provide. They say the article is a direct result of their challenging the ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù in relation to maternity services. One to One Midwives responded to the article drafted by the Manchester Evening News, quoting: \\"In order to reassure those of you that may be receiving care from One to One I would like to correct a number of inaccuracies in the article. Both of the babies died of natural causes, one baby died at a few days old and one baby died at a few weeks. Both of the babies were born in hospital and there were no concerns raised about the care the mothers or babies had received from One to One. Following on from the sad events both families continued to receive care and support from their One to One midwives.\\" The company offices in Warrington had graffiti reading ‚Äònot NHS‚Äô scrawled on the shutters twice in May 2018. In July 2020 the Warrington Guardian reported that the company had failed to pay bills to maternity units in Warrington, St Helens, Liverpool, Chester, Mid Cheshire and Wirral when they took over woman‚Äôs care when there were complications they couldn't handle. The outstanding debts totalled more than ¬£2.6 million. Between 2013 and 2019 the company was paid a total of ¬£5,834,242 by Wirral Clinical Commissioning Group, the lead commissioner. Parkington called the CCG tariff ‚Äònot viable or sustainable‚Äô just before the company collapsed.

During the 1950s, he won several significant desegregation lawsuits and was, for a quarter of a century, the president of the Greensboro branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Beginning in 1955, Simkins used the courts and local referenda to compel the desegregation of recreational facilities, schools, and hospitals and end discrimination in the delivery of public housing, banking services, and city services.  Background  Simkins was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, on August 23, 1924, the first child of George C. Simkins Sr., a dentist and community leader, and Guyrene Tyson Simkins, an educator. He grew up in sports and was a natural athlete, and was even a nationally ranked badminton player. Simkins attended Dudley High School in Greensboro before matriculating into Herzl Junior College in Chicago, and then Talladega College, from which he graduated. He earned his dentistry degree from Meharry School of Dentistry in 1948 and completed his rotating internship at Jersey City Medical Center. Simkins opened a private dentistry practice upon returning to Greensboro and joined the Guilford County Health Department, becoming the first African American employed there.  Gillespie Golf Course  In 1940, the city of Greensboro constructed a golf course using public funds - 65 percent of which were provided by the federal government ‚Äì as part of the Works Progress Administration. The course was opened in 1949 by the city of Greensboro as a public facility exclusively for whites. In 1955, Simkins decided to challenge the city council's segregation rule by going to the Gillespie Park course to play. On December 7, 1955, the same week the Montgomery bus boycott was launched in the wake of Rosa Park's defiance of bus segregation, he and five others went to the Gillespie Park course where they presented green fees, but were not given permission to play ‚Äì they were told the Gillespie Park Golf Course was a private course for members only.From the George Simkins Jr. Papers, Archives Collection, F.D. Bluford Library, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, NC Simkins placed seventy-five cents, the green fee for the course, on the counter and proceeded to the course after insisting on his right to play. The manager approached Dr. Simkins and his five companions and demanded they leave, but they refused and continued to play. That night, Simkins and the five other players were arrested and charged with trespassing. On February 6, 1956, all six men were convicted of simple trespass and fined fifteen dollars and court costs. They appealed to the Superior Court, and were found guilty in December 1956. The trespass charges were finally thrown out by the North Carolina State Supreme Court in June 1957. In a second trial, which was ordered because the arrest warrants had been altered to call Gillespie a \\"club\\" rather than a \\"course\\", a list of everyone who played at Gillespie was obtained. Two members of the all- white jury were on the list. The judge imposed a maximum 30-day sentence. Before the appeal to the state Supreme Court, middle district judge Johnson J. Hayes of North Wilkesboro gave the 6 a declaratory judgment, calling the \\"so- call lease\\" as a private facility invalid. \\"To hold otherwise would open a Pandora's box by which governmental agencies could deprive citizens of their constitutional rights by the artifice of a lease,\\" Hayes wrote in his opinion. Hayes ruled that the plaintiffs were unlawfully denied access to use Gillespie Park and \\"this was done solely due to the color and race of plaintiffs\\" and said he intended to open the golf course to all citizens. \\"The golf club permits white people to play without being members, except it requires the prepayment of green fees\\", he wrote. \\"The plaintiffs here paid their fees, were forced off the course by being arrested for trespass. Everybody knows this was done because the plaintiffs were Negroes and for no other reason. This court cannot ignore it.\\" The statement and evidence, however, were left out of the record presented to the state Supreme Court, which denied the criminal appeal. The case, Wolfe v. North Carolina, was presented to the U. S. Supreme Court in 1958, which ruled 5-4 against the Gillespie 6.Wolfe v. State of N. C., 364 U.S. 177, 80 S. Ct. 1482, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1650 (U.S.N.C. 1960) \\"Chief Justice Earl Warren and the rest of the justices couldn't understand why something so important was left out of the record\\", Simkins said. Thurgood Marshall (director ‚Äìgeneral for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund) said \\"George, your lawyers ought to be the ones going to jail instead of us the way they screwed the case up.\\" A strong dissenting opinion by Chief Justice Warren prompted North Carolina Governor Luther Hodges to commute the jail sentences of the five surviving plaintiffs. After the clubhouse was burned two weeks before Judge Hayes' order to integrate the course, the Fire Marshall condemned the entire facility. Greensboro's City Council voted to go out of the recreation business, eventually selling the property on which nine of the holes were built. It took seven years, a campaign to vote in a completely new City Council and the pleading of the entire community, including former pro Ernie Edwards, to get Gillespie reopened. On December 7, 1962, the nine remaining holes at Gillespie welcomed golfers again. Simkins was the first man to tee off. \\"It's about time\\", he said before striking the ball.  Simkins et al. v. Greensboro  In October 1956, while the initial trespass case was still active, Dr. Simkins filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina against the City of Greensboro for racial discrimination in maintaining a public golf course for white citizens only.Simkins v. City of Greensboro, 149 F. Supp. 562 (M.D.N.C. 1957) aff'd, 246 F.2d 425 (4th Cir. 1957) Simkins et al. v. Greensboro was filed by Dr. Simkins as head of the local chapter of the NAACP, and he was joined by nine others, including the five golfers who had joined him in December 1955. On March 20, 1957, the court ruled in favor of Simkins, stating in the opinion that the city of Greensboro could not escape its legal duties to provide equal privileges to all citizens to enjoy city functions. The case was immediately appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the District Court's ruling and ordered the city to discontinue operating the course on a segregated basis.City of Greensboro v. Simkins, 246 F.2d 425 (4th Cir. 1957)  Simkins v. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital  In the early 1960s, only nine hospitals existed for African Americans in North Carolina, and most were overcrowded and offered inadequate healthcare. According to historian Karen Thomas, \\"Most hospitals in North Carolina and throughout the South did not accept black patients on an equal basis and did not allow black physicians to admit patients or train as interns.\\" Even though most North Carolina hospitals were privately operated, some accepted state and federal funds and that implicated possible government discrimination. Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital was one of two Greensboro hospitals that had received state and federal funds via the 1946 Hill-Burton Hospital Survey and Construction Act. After his patient had been denied by the Cone and Long Hospitals, George discovered that the same facilities had been built with federal funding. This fact opened a pathway for a possible legal remedy. Because the hospitals had accepted government funds they were not strictly private, George and other plaintiffs filed their suit on these grounds. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that Public Health Service Regulations providing separate-but-equal services violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The NAACP assisted the plaintiffs as they gained support behind their petition, and the activist group hired Conrad Pearson, an NAACP attorney from Durham, to file the petition to federal district court. On December 5, 1962, the U.S. District Court of the Fourth Circuit decided in the hospitals' favor. Judge Stanley contended that Moses H. Cone and Wesley Long were both private hospitals, not government entities. Relying on The Civil Rights Cases (1883) reasoning, Judge Stanley opined that the two hospitals had a right to discriminate if they chose to. Even though the plaintiffs lost, they appealed to the U.S Court of Appeals, and in November 1963, the court overruled the previous court's decision. The appellate court found that the hospitals had violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because they were connected to the government through the Hill-Burton funds. In addition, the court found that the two Greensboro hospitals had violated the Constitution. Although the black health facilities were separate from white hospitals they most definitely were not equal. After their loss, the hospitals filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy filed a brief for Simkins and the other plaintiffs, but the Supreme Court denied the case. According to Karen Kruse Thomas, the Simkins v. Cone (1963) \\"decision marked the first time that federal courts applied the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to prohibit racial discrimination by a private entity\\" (Encyclopedia of N.C., p. 1038). The year after the Simkins decision, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, officially prohibiting private discrimination in public places.Simkins v. Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp., 211 F.

Encyclopedia of North Carolina (University of North Carolina Press: Chapel Hill, NC) 2006 Heralded by many as a landmark case, Simkins became the Brown v Board of Education decision for hospitals. Between 1963 and 2001, there were over 260 references to Simkins in other legal decisions, more than any other case involving hospital racial discrimination.  Wachovia Bank Picketing  In the spring of 1964, Simkins helped start a movement in Greensboro to gain African-Americans \\"consideration for non-traditional jobs on basis of ability and for on-the-job training\\" in order to \\"afford equal employment opportunity\\" by organizing picketing of Wachovia Bank for job discrimination. Wachovia maintained that it \\"hired on the basis of merit\\", yet employed no African-Americans in any of their Greensboro offices. Picketing began on April 28, 1964, and ended just forty-eight hours later with the hiring of two African-American tellers. In a letter to Wachovia, George noted that Wachovia was able to \\"find the qualified Negros it had been unable to locate during the last two years\\" when he had first broached the topic Wachovia's discriminatory practices as head of the Greensboro NAACP.

The film features Vikram Prabhu, Sri Divya, Soori, and John Vijay in the lead roles. The film commenced shoot from May 2014. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics, but it was a box office hit. Plot Police Pandi (Soori), the owner of a real estate agency, borrows 15 lakhs from Vatti Varadhan (John Vijay), a local rowdy and don, to start his business. Murugan (Vikram Prabhu) is Pandi's assistant, and he gives the media an advertisement in which he persuades people to buy land from 'his' company, making many people persuaded from it. A billionaire wants to buy all the land, and when he is about to sign the papers, they find out that the land is actually a graveyard, causing the billionaire to not buy the land. When they are in the bar drinking alcohol, a call comes on Pandi's phone. Murugan answers it, thinking that it was the broker who sold them the land, but it was actually Varadhan. Murugan talks to Varadhan in foul language, and when he ends the call, Pandi tells him that it was actually Varadhan. He then goes to another table and asks a man for some wine. The whole group befriends the man, who is mute. The next morning, they find themselves in Varadhan's house, where it is just like jail. There are many people who work there because they could not give back the money they borrowed. They all end up working there, except for Murugan, who saved Varadhan when a few men tried to kill him, causing him to become his supervisor. One day, a worker in there gets to go home, revealing to the others that 'Chinnamma' lets some people go. When Murugan inquires about her to Pandi, he tells himthat she is Varadhan's sister. Murugan then goes to her room and threatens her to let them go as well, but when he sees Yamuna/'Chinnamma' (Sri Divya), he immediately falls for her and starts wooing her, but she does not accept him. One day, Varadhan arranges for his engagement, and Murugan and Pandi start arranging everything. When the Iyar Swamji asks them to bring the bride, Murugan gets shocked seeing Yamuna as the bride. When Pandi asks Varadhan's servants why they brought Varadhan's sister, they revealed that she is not his sister and is the woman that he has been waiting to marry. Murugan drinks wine after hearing this but then sees Yamuna escaping. They get on a lorry, and Yamuna reveals why she escaped. Yamuna's mother died when she was five years old, and her father Manickam (Gnanavel) looked after her. Manickam takes care of the people's problems, considers them as his own, and helps them. He promises the men that he will give Varadhan the money they borrowed, and helps them. One day, Manickam dies, and no one helps Yamuna give Varadhan the money that Manickam promised to give. Varadhan gives her an idea by saying that if she marries him, she will not need to give the money, so Yamuna reluctantly agrees. Murugan then asks if she needs any help, but Yamuna refuses, and they separate. Somehow, Varadhan finds them and hits Murugan unconscious. He forcefully takes Yamuna with him and arranges their marriage. However, the man who is unable to speak, later revealed to be a terrorist, dies, and their marriage stops. Yamuna sees Murugan, hugs him, and asks him to kill Varadhan and stop the marriage. Murugan agrees and plans to kill him, but everything does not go according to plan when some terrorists kidnap Varadhan. Finally, Yamuna and Murugan are united together by quarreling.

It was found to have a different painting hidden under it using X-ray technology in 2014 by a group of art historians and scientists from the Phillips Collection in Washington, assisted by scientists from the Cornell University High Energy Synchrotron Source. Painting qualities In The Blue Room we can see Picasso‚Äôs blue period being fully developed. His cool hues and strong use of natural light draw the viewer in to see this young idealized woman bathing in a tub in what we can assume is her bedroom. Although the painting could be described as patchy or mildly unclear, the subject and scene are still identifiable. The woman's figure and small studio background are typical of Picasso's blue period, as seen in other works such as The Blind Man‚Äôs Meal (1903).‚ÄúPablo Picasso: The Blind Man‚Äôs Meal‚Äù. Among Picasso's monochromatic paintings, The Blue Room has a significant role along with The Old Guitarist due to their rich details and inspiration sources rather than other portraits of the artist. The poster on the wall and colors chosen carefully to allude hope as inner meaning, come forefront in a superficial examination. Painting materials The painting was investigated by several scientific methods in 2017.Favero, P., Mass, J., Delaney, J., Woll, A., Hull, A., Dooley, K. and Finnefrock, A. (2017). Reflectance imaging spectroscopy and synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence mapping used in a technical study of The Blue Room by Pablo Picasso. Heritage Science, 5(1). The investigation revealed the hidden portrait described below and the identity of the pigments used in both paintings. Picasso employed a wide palette of vivid pigments such as vermilion, viridian, chrome yellow, and cadmium yellow. He used predominantly Prussian blue for the blue areas.Pablo Picasso, The Blue Room, ColourLex Hidden painting Although this piece can be considered typical of Picasso‚Äôs early blue period works, something interesting has come up in the last few years concerning this piece. Using x-ray cameras, scientists from the Phillip‚Äôs Collection in Washington discovered another painting just underneath the surface: a portrait of an old man resting his head in his hands.Simon, ‚ÄúBuried by Picasso, The Man Beneath ‚ÄòThe Blue Room‚Äô Tells a Story,‚Äù 1. Identity of this old man is assumed as art dealer Ambroise Vollard whose Vollard Art Gallery at Rue Laffitte. Vollard has had a crucial role in Picasso's art career by providing him his first exhibition in France. Possible conclusions Historians who have collectively collected biographical information regarding Picasso and his life during his Blue Period have concluded that he likely painted over another of his paintings because of his prolificacy in painting but lack of extra canvases. His economic state would not have allowed him to purchase the many materials needed in order to be a full-time artist. His ‚Äúmelancholy blue portraits‚Äù did not result in many eager buyers, or people willing to pay for the portraits he created of random people off the street. Picasso likely painted over several of his works until one would sell, earning money to purchase more materials.Simon, Buried by Picasso, The Man Beneath 'The Blue Room' Tells a Story, 1.

Description The station was one of the three original stations opened on the Cowbridge and Aberthaw Railway. It served the village of St Mary Church, which was about a mile to the west, and also served a number of other smaller settlements, none of which were particularly close to the railway.Chapman 1984, p. 63 The station consisted of a single platform with a building of red and yellow bricks. It was of a similar design to the one at Cowbridge, but smaller. It had a goods-loop opposite the platform. The station was fully signalled and the signal box was located on the platform beside the passenger building. St Mary Church Road was the only station on the Cowbridge-Aberthaw line to be signaled. The remainder of the line was worked on the 'one engine in steam' principle.Chapman 1984, p. 63 History Like the rest of the stations between Cowbridge and Aberthaw Low Level, St Mary Church Road was underused from the outset. The signal box was closed in 1900 and the station was without signals from then on.Chapman 1984, p. 77 The loop was retained as a siding and new ground-frames were added to control it. Closure The passenger service ended in 1930. Goods facilities lasted for another two years but they themselves were very meagre.Chapman 1984, p. 104 Goods came mostly from private sidings, but by the 1930s, the limeworking facilities at Aberthaw and Greldaw were closed. The Aberthaw Cement Works sent most of its traffic by the Vale of Glamorgan Line and the limeworks at St Athan sent only small amounts of traffic by rail. By 1932, the station handled just a small amount of agricultural traffic. The Great Western Railway duly closed the station on 1 November 1932.Hall 2009, p. 89 After closure, the stationmaster, Mr Billy Lewis, was transferred to Ystradowen. The site today Although most traces of the station are gone, the red and yellow station building still stands, and is in quite good condition. It is now used for agricultural purposes.

Both the houses and their residents were obliged to display the yellow star by Budapest mayoral decree.  Unique in the Holocaust  Although houses reserved for Jews were occasionally marked in Germany, and Nazi-occupied France and the Netherlands, the Hungarian legal prescription of marking all Budapest houses in which Jews were obliged to reside with a yellow star was unique in the history of the Holocaust.  Antecedents  A series of anti-Jewish laws and decrees introduced from 1938 onwards gradually excluded Jews from participation in intellectual professions, banned marriages and sexual relations between Jewish men and non-Jewish women, and designated individuals as ‚ÄòJewish‚Äô on the basis of family lineage, thus defining those who had converted to Christianity as Jews. On 25 November 1940, Hungary joined the Axis, and declared war on the Soviet Union on 27 June 1941. Jewish men and others defined as ‚Äòpolitically unreliable‚Äô were conscripted for forced labour in auxiliary roles from 1941 onward. By 1942, tens of thousands of Jewish forced labourers had been sent to the Eastern Front to face arduous conditions. In a bid to stop her wartime ally from leaving the war, Germany troops occupied Hungary on 19 March 1944. Former Hungarian ambassador to Berlin D√∂me Szt√≥jay was appointed Prime Minister by Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy, and Adolf Eichmann and his commando also arrived in Budapest on the same day. From 5 April 1944, all individuals defined as Jewish and over the age of six were obliged to wear a 10 x 10 cm yellow Star of David on their outer clothing. In May 1944, the Hungarian Interior Ministry limited Jews‚Äô access to bath houses, hotels, restaurants and cinemas, and prescribed certain times of day when Jews were allowed to buy rationed groceries.  Creation of the yellow-star houses  On 16 June 1944, with the aim of forcibly relocating and concentration the Jewish community of Budapest, which just under one-quarter of the city‚Äôs population √Åkos Farkas, the mayor of Budapest issued the first decree and a list of over 2,600 designated yellow-star houses. The deadline for moving in was midnight on 21 June 1944. A second Budapest mayoral decree issued on 24 June 1944 attached a final list of 1,944 designated yellow-star houses. In the intervening period, residents submitted petitions to Budapest Metropolitan Council: non-Jews wanted their houses removed from the list, while Jewish residents wanted their houses added. Compared to the first June 16 list of houses, the second list contained far fewer houses on the western Buda side of the Danube. Mass relocation was overseen by the police and the Jewish Council in Hungary. The 1,944 yellow-star houses functioned as compulsory places of residence for Budapest Jews until late November 1944 when, following the Arrow Cross takeover of power on 15 October 1944, Jews were moved into the 7th district ghetto, or to a ‚Äòprotected‚Äô house in the 13th district, where neutral states in World War II (Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, and the Vatican), as well as the Italian diplomat Giorgio Perlasca, and the International Committee of the Red Cross provided protection for those holding protection documents in 119 ‚Äòprotected‚Äô houses, 98 of which were also yellow- star houses.

In keeping with US immigration laws, the orchestra submitted its list of members for clearance. Seven musicians were not given clearance; this was later pared down to six: Budd, Dirk Keetbaas, William Kuinka, Abe Mannheim, John Moskalyk, and Steven Staryk (later known as the Symphony Six), who were denied access to the United States under suspicion of leftist activities. The performers had associated openly with communist or communist front organizations in the vein of artistic collaboration, but denied the charges of political involvement. Budd later said in an interview that she had been a member of a left-wing youth group. At the end of the season the orchestra did not renew its contracts with these musicians. This created a controversy in Canada. =Later career= After her contract was not renewed in 1952, Budd went on to play with the Halifax Symphony Orchestra, the Hart House Orchestra, the CBC Symphony Orchestra, and the orchestras of the Canadian Opera Company, the National Ballet of Canada, and the Stratford Festival. In 1964 she was rehired by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and performed as a double bassist until 1989, becoming \\"one of the most beloved members of the orchestra\\".

It was published between 1757 and 1792, and copies were given to selected recipients across Europe. Despite the title, the Antichit√† di Ercolano shows objects from all the excavations the Bourbons undertook around the Gulf of Naples. These include Pompeii, Stabiae, and two sites in Herculaneum: Resina and Portici. The engravings are high quality and the accompanying text displays great scholarship, but the book lacks the information on context that would be expected of a modern archaeological work. Le Antichit√† was designed more to impress readers with the quality of the objects in the King of Naples' collection than to be used in research. The book gave impetus to the neoclassical movement in Europe by giving artists and decorators access to a huge store of Hellenistic motifs. Background Victory sacrifices to Athena (volume 2) The excavations at Heculaneum began in 1711, when a well was being dug for the new country house of Emmanuel Maurice, Duke of Elbeuf at Portici. The well turned out to have been sunk into the buried and richly ornamented proscenium of the theater of Herculaneum, and yielded several valuable marbles, including a statue of Hercules. The duke was extremely short of money. He smuggled the pieces to Rome to be restored, and then \\"gave\\" them to Prince Eugene of Savoy, his cousin. In 1738 Charles VII of Naples ‚àí after 1759, Charles III of Spain ‚àí began excavations to find objects for his private collection of antiquities, imposing tight security on the site. Interest was maintained by the hope of finding more objects of similar value to the first set of statues. In 1739 a set of large mythical groups were found in the \\"Basilica\\". By 1748 the excavations had unearthed eight full-sized bronze statues. The large works were restored and put on display in the king's museum at Portici. The smaller works were generally not exhibited. The excavations were done by slaves, and it seems that much was destroyed or stolen. News of the finds spread, and Charles drew criticism for the secrecy and lack of science in the excavations. Publication Nereid on a panther (volume 3) The first publication to record the findings was a large folio book called Disegni intagliati in rame di pitture antiche ritrovate nelle scavazioni di Resina (Copper engravings of the ancient paintings discovered in the excavations of Resina) printed in 1746. Despite the title, the book included drawings of statuettes in bronze and marble, lamps and reliefs. Some engravings showed the objects as they were, while others showed the artist's reconstruction of the original. There were many inaccuracies. The book gave no indication of the locations where the objects were found. Only three copies have survived. These may be the only ones that were produced, perhaps because Charles was dissatisfied with the result. The Prodromo delle Antichit√† di Ercolano (Preface to the Antiquities of Herculaneum) was prepared by Ottavio Antonio Bayardi, cousin of the prime minister Giovanni Fogliani, and issued by the Stamperia Reale in 1752. The five volume work tells stories of Hercules and tries to prove that the city was in fact Herculaneum, which had not been in doubt since an inscription was found in 1738, but says nothing about the findings. In 1754 Bayardi published a one volume catalog of the findings. Without illustrations, and with only the most cursory descriptions of the 2,000 objects listed, the catalog has little value. In 1755 Charles appointed fifteen savants to a newly formed Accademia Ercolanese to study the artifacts and publish the findings. The committee engaged twenty-five leading artists to prepare drawings and engravings on the finds, including Giovanni Elia Morghen, Carlo Nolli and Giovanni Battista Casanova. The best engravers were given the most interesting pieces. A given engraver would be given all pieces of a given style, to ensure consistency. The academy issued volumes of the work from 1757 to 1792. They were not sold, but were given to the \\"happy few\\" that were chosen as recipients. Two thousand copies were printed of the first volume. Charles abdicated in 1759 and was succeeded by the eight-year-old Ferdinand IV. Publication continued under the regent Tanucci. The first four volumes depicted paintings. These were painted wall fragments, including fragments removed from the portico. The fifth volume, published in 1767, was devoted to bronze busts. Another volume on bronze statues was issued in 1771. Plates from the Antichita were copied in London in 1773. Another volume on paintings came out in 1779. An abridged version of the book was published in 1789. The last volume, in 1792, depicted lamps and candelabras. The volumes do not include depictions of the marbles. Centaur and lyre player Contents Despite the title, the Antichit√† di Ercolano shows objects from all the excavations the Bourbons undertook around the Gulf of Naples. These include Pompeii, Stabiae, and two sites in Herculaneum: Resina and Portici. The book displays a high level of scholarship for the time, and the engravings are of high quality. Most engravings show the frame, if known, have a measurement scale, and are accompanied by a scholarly essay. Some of the smaller objects do not have entries, but are reproduced as unnamed headpieces or tailpieces. There are about 619 copperplate engravings, some double, 836 vignettes and 540 illuminated letters designed by Luigi Vanvitelli and engraved by Carlo Nolli. The organization was based more on aesthetics than on explaining the context of the Roman site. The first volume contains the largest and most beautiful images. The images of paintings on fragments of the porticus are spread across all five volumes to cover paintings, since the first set of fragments from the portico were found in 1738, and the second set in 1761 after the first two volumes had been published. The artists again indulged in their imagination. A horseback rider that had been shown in the Disegni intagliati with the horse's tail and the rider's right hand missing was drawn by Vincenzo Campana as if it were in undamaged condition. Images within each volume are grouped by location, more because they have consistent styles than to show the Roman context. The text typically gave no information about the date and place of the find. The largest four images from the portico are depictions of Theseus, Hercules and Telephus, Achilles and Chiron, and Marsyas and Olympus. The engravers treat them as flat paintings, although in fact they were concave, and their shape shows where they were originally placed in the building. The book contains only a small selection of the paintings that were taken to Portici, although it seems that drawings were made of all these paintings. From 1765 onward the artists drew each painting as it appeared on the wall it decorated. Eagle Lamp (volume 8) Response The images in the Antichit√† di Ercolano, with their Hellenistic origins, had huge appeal to Europeans of the time, and the book provided a great stock of classical motifs that could be used by designers and scholars. The publication was more an advertisement for the collection of remains held in the Palace of Portici than an archaeological record. It was said that due to the book \\"students of antiquity - that is virtually all lovers of art - would have felt bound to go to Naples, as they were bound to go to Florence and Rome.\\" The discussion the book generated was mainly about the artistic merits of the wall paintings than about Roman life. It did not cause the rise of neoclassicism, which had earlier origins, but it had a large influence on the decorative arts in Europe. The plates were often used as sources for paintings. Thus Nicolas Gosse and Auguste Vinchon seem to have used it for a series of Scenes from Ancient Life painted in gray-scale for the Louvre. Robert Adam, the British designer, copied figures in the book from the \\"Villa of Cicero\\" to the ceiling of the Red Drawing Room at Syon House in 1761-62. The 1763 La Marchande d'Amours (or La Marchande √† la toilette) by Joseph-Marie Vien is a well known example of early French neoclassicism. It is based on an engraving by Carlo Nolli of a painting on the same subject from volume 3 of the Antichit√† di Ercolano. Vien was open about his borrowing, and invited his audience to compare the two works. The main difference is in the intensity of expression of the three women in Vien's picture, the seller looking at the buyers and the buyers looking at the cupid, compared to the blank expressions and unfocused gazes of the women in Nolli's engraving.

Himmelpforten Convent (Low Saxon: Klooster Hemelpoorten, ; ) was founded as a monastery of nuns following the Cistercian Rule during the 13th century in Himmelpforten, in today's Lower Saxony, Germany. During the 16th century, it was converted into use as a Lutheran Damsels' Convent. The Himmelpforten Convent was founded before 1255 and finally dissolved in 1647.Peter von Kobbe, Geschichte und Landesbeschreibung der Herzogth√ºmer Bremen und Verden: 2 vols., G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Rupprecht, 1824, vol. 1: p. 120\\\\.

As the Cistercian Order had restricted the incorporation of the growing number of women's monastic communities who followed the Cistercian Rule, and since no existing deed neither records the incorporation of the Himmelpforten Convent, nor the appointment of a Father Abbot, as usual for an affiliated community of women, Porta Coeli most likely never officially joined that Order.Silvia Schulz- Hauschildt, Himmelpforten ‚Äì Eine Chronik, Gemeinde Himmelpforten municipality (ed.), Stade: Hansa-Druck Stelzer, 1990, p. 33\\\\.

No ISBN.Adding up to the conflict was the fact that the Archdiocese of Bremen, upholding the claim of the merged Hamburg Archdiocese, tried to enforce its claim as metropolis over the new Baltic dioceses, whose incumbent bishops again, originating from the Bremian prince-archbishopric, strove for the erection of a Baltic metropolis, succeeding in 1253/1255 with the elevation of Riga to an archdiocese, with Dorpat as its suffragan. In their aim to establish unrivalled territorial control, the Bremen Cathedral Chapter, led by its then Provost Gerard of Lippe,Being a son of Bernard III, Lord of Lippe he was promoted by his granduncle Prince-Archbishop Gebhard to be elected provost, striving to succeed him, he gained support among the enfranchised capitular canons and acted as rivalling archbishop, however, he succumbed to Count Hildebold of Wunstorf, the other rivalling archbishop, in a feud and was most likely killed in action in 1259. besides fulfilling religious tasks of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bremen also wielding the secular rule in the much smaller Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, together with the prince-archbishop of Bremen, then Gerard's sick granduncle , since 1251 represented by Coadjutor , Prince- Bishop of Paderborn, being Gerard's uncle and Gebhard's nephew, managed to integrate the Porta Coeli convent and its holdings as a temporality within the prince-archiepiscopal sovereign territory. With establishing Porta Coeli as a prince-archiepiscopal outpost to observe and surveil the peasants' ambitions Gerard and Simon of Lippe pursued Prince-Archbishop Gebhard's long-term project of enforcing the reign over the free peasants, e.g. manifesting in Gebhard's earlier subjection of the Stedingers. The integration of Himmelpforten Convent into the prince-archiepiscopal temporalities was fixed in a deed, issued in 1255, on the occasion of moving the convent to then Eylsede/ Eulsete village (literally: Eylo's/Eilhard's seat), later adopting the Low Saxon translation tor Hemmelporten or to der Himilporten of the convent's Latin name Porta Coeli (Gate of Heaven;Cf. the Christian imagery of Mary of Nazareth as the Gate of Heaven refers to Ezekiel's \\"closed gate\\" (). modern standard German: Himmelpforten).Silvia Schulz-Hauschildt, Himmelpforten ‚Äì Eine Chronik, Gemeinde Himmelpforten municipality (ed.), Stade: Hansa-Druck Stelzer, 1990, p. 23\\\\.

For the threat of Wursten Bremen's Prince-Archbishop Johann Rode was prepared, since already on 16 November he and Hamburg's three burgomasters (upcoming, presiding, and outgoing), Johannes Huge, Hermen Langenbeck and Henning Buring had concluded a defensive alliance. Rode appealed at the burghers of Bremen, Hamburg and Stade, which considered the areas downstream the rivers Elbe and Weser their own front yard existential for their free maritime trade connections, so the three Hanseatic cities supported Rode, who further won the Ditmarsians, free peasants under Bremen's loose overlordship.Elke Freifrau von Boeselager, ‚ÄûDas Land Hadeln bis zum Beginn der fr√ºhen Neuzeit‚Äú, in: Geschichte des Landes zwischen Elbe und Weser: 3 vols., Hans-Eckhard Dannenberg and Heinz-Joachim Schulze (eds.) on behalf of the Landschaftsverband der ehemaligen Herzogt√ºmer Bremen und Verden, Stade: Landschaftsverband der ehemaligen Herzogt√ºmer Bremen und Verden, 1995 and 2008, vol.

Wursten was thus threatened by Oldenburg from the west and by Magnus from the east. In order to avoid war on two fronts Rode tried to ease the relation with Magnus, but in vain.

Now the allied troops of Sweden, the city of Bremen and the Prince- Archbishopric of Bremen under Achatius Tott captured the prince-archbishopric and John Frederick resumed his office as its Administrator regnant. Highly indebted as he was after recruiting and arming his troops allied with the Swedes, he brought in a bill to confiscate all the monasteries in the prince- archbishopric. However, on 20 and 28 May 1633O.S. on the diet in Basdahl the estates of the prince-archbishopric rejected that, but allowed the Administrator regnant to collect the revenues of the monasteries until the Thirty Years' War would end.

Possessions and revenues Porta Coeli never developed a sustainable farming of its own. Its landed estates and other revenue-yielding assets did not form a closed compound but were dispersed in the central and northeastern part of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (Stade Geest and Bremian Elbe Marshes). Like many other nunneries Porta Coeli lived of feudal leases, tithes and other dues, earlier often in kind, such as also socage and serjeanty.

History The estate was transferred to the Diocese of Viborg in 1404. It became the property of the Crown in 1536 and was sold to Henrik Below (1540‚Äì1606), a nobleman with the Danish court. The oldest section of the building is the south wing, which was constructed c. 1521. The east and north wings followed between 1525 and 1530. The western end of the north wing was destroyed by an incoming tidal wave in 1534. The large arched windows were walled up, leaving only narrow sighting slits. The oldest part of the building is the cellar with cross vaults supported by pillars. The ramparts and the double moat served to defend the castle from cannon fire. Castle entrance After Below acquired the castle, he fitted it out as a stately family home with towers and a ballroom. With the Reformation, the castle lost its importance as a fort and was uninhabited for an extended period. In 1702, Axel Rosenkrantz acquired the dilapidated property and proceeded to renovate it. On his death in 1724, his son Mogens Rosenkrantz took it over. In 1784, Peder Nissen, a rich farmer from Ribe bought the castle, leaving it to his 17-year-old son Nis Nissen when he died four years later. After Nis's death in 1849, the property came into the hands of successive owners, none of whom were able to carry out necessary repairs. Finally, after a fire in 1937, the state decided to acquire the castle and the estate. Restoration work was completed in 1941, leading to the opening of the building as a museum on 15 June 1941. Open to visitors The castle museum is open to visitors from mid-April to the end of October.

One of the largest cicadas in South Africa, this species reaches 40‚Äì50 mm in length. Its wings display green, brown and translucent patches, and are covered with silvery hairs. It is endemic to South Africa, and occurs in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces. It prefers indigenous forests, where undergrowth is sparse and trees are more than 4m tall, but may also be found in stands of Quercus robur, Populus deltoides, pine and eucalyptus. It is also unusually found in dense riverine bushes in KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape. Males usually call from a position a few meters above the ground on a shady limb of a tree, with a good view of the immediate surroundings and potential predators. Males often sing in chorus to attract mates, particularly at dusk and dawn, enabled to do this by an endothermic metabolism which rises to more than 22 ¬∞C above ambient temperature. This endothermy during crepuscular hours allows the use of optimal atmospheric conditions for acoustic communication and reduces chances of predation to a minimum. The species also produces an encounter call used in courtship and maintaining personal space within choruses, behaving aggressively to other males venturing closer than about 50 cm. Choruses may start up at any time of the day, but concentrate their calling in a half-hour period at dawn and dusk.

Published in 1963, it was her seventh novel. Plot The Unicorn is set in a remote area on the west coast of Ireland. The book begins with the arrival of Marian Taylor, a young English school teacher who has accepted a position as governess at an isolated country house called Gaze Castle. She is surprised to learn that there are no children at Gaze, and that she will be teaching French and Italian to the lady of the house, Hannah Crean-Smith. Part 1 describes Marian's growing awareness of the situation at Gaze Castle, as recounted to her by other characters. Her main informant is Denis Nolan, the estate's clerk. She learns that Hannah has been confined to Gaze and its grounds by her husband Peter for seven years as punishment for having been unfaithful to him and for nearly killing him. Peter had been an abusive and unfaithful husband, and was often absent. During one of these absences, Hannah had an affair with Pip Lejour, who owns a nearby house called Riders. Peter arrived home unexpectedly and caught them in bed together. Later, after a struggle between Hannah and Peter, Peter fell over a cliff. He was badly injured but survived. He then left Gaze, leaving the estate in the hands of his former lover Gerald Scottow. In Part 2 the narrative focus moves to Effingham Cooper, another outsider who arrives on the scene from London. Effingham is a successful public servant in his forties who is visiting his retired former Philosophy tutor Max Lejour, Pip Lejour's father, at Riders. Effingham is in love with Hannah and he tries to persuade to run away with him, but she refuses. He resigns himself to the situation, seeing himself as a courtly lover adoring Hannah from afar. Marian urges him to join her in a plan to rescue Hannah. He refuses, saying that Hannah is resigned to her fate and does not want to leave. In Part 3 Effingham changes his mind and the rescue attempt takes place. He and Marian try to take advantage of Gerald Scottow's absence to abduct Hannah in Effingham's car, but the attempt fails. Another car, driven by Max's daughter Alice Lejour, unexpectedly comes toward them, and Effingham's car goes off the driveway and gets stuck in mud. Gerald Scottow returns to Gaze just in time to see what has happened. Effingham leaves with Alice in her car. Later, Alice returns with the news that Effingham has become lost in the bog. Part 4 begins with Effingham's experiences wandering in the bog, in which he becomes stuck before being rescued by Denis Nolan. Gerald announces that Peter Crean-Smith is returning to the house after an absence of seven years. Hannah summons Gerald to her room, where he spends several hours. Gerald announces that he is going to take Hannah away from Gaze before Peter arrives. Parts 5, 6 and 7 describe a series of violent events that result in the deaths of several of the main characters. After Gerald announces that Peter is not returning after all, and that he and Hannah are staying, Pip Lejour comes to Gaze and asks Hannah to leave with him, but she refuses. Hannah shoots and kills Gerald, and later runs away from the house and falls or jumps from a cliff and is killed. On his way back to Gaze after hearing of Gerald's death, Peter is killed when the car in which Denis is driving him from the airport goes into the sea. At the end of the novel Effingham and Marian return separately to London. Major themes The novel's dramatic plot and remote setting are characteristic of Gothic fiction. Murdoch biographer and critic Peter J. Conradi notes the author's effective use of \\"the stage props and scenery of the Romantic sublime\\", including massive cliffs overlooking a dangerous sea, isolated castles, mysterious megaliths, and a deadly bog containing carnivorous plants. Both religion and philosophy are important themes in the book. The central character Hannah is a believing Christian and the unicorn of the title is a symbol of Christ. The book's philosophical themes are presented chiefly by the Platonist philosopher Max Lejour, in his conversations with his former student Effingham Cooper. Their discussion of the situation at Gaze Castle in Chapter 12 deals with power, freedom, suffering, and especially with the nature of \\"goodness\\". The typically Murdochian situation of an \\"enchanter\\" character surrounded by his or her coterie is exemplified by the household at Gaze. The relationships among the characters also illustrate the connection between erotic love and power relations that runs through Murdoch's fiction. Literary significance and reception According to Conradi, The Times \\"was mystified by The Unicorn\\", while The Tablet and The Month reviewed it favourably. The New York Times reviewer emphasized the novel's Gothic characteristics, and commented that it \\"has that magnetic quality that is more usually the attribute of the detective story\\". The reviewer suggests that while the \\"familiarity of her material is one of her strengths\\", the reader is \\"led further and further into the mystery and terror of existence\\". Several critics have remarked on the \\"closed\\" nature of the novel. Murdoch herself distinguished between the open novel, in which the characters are free to act, and the closed novel whose structure creates \\"a mythic and poetic intensity which the characters on occasion subserve\\". She has been criticized for exercising a \\"tyranny of form over character\\" while writing \\"according to the dictates of an obsolete standard and within the context of tired patterns\\". Conradi, on the other hand, argues that Murdoch's closed novels, of which The Unicorn is one, were not mere experiments in genre fiction, secondary to her more character-driven works, but were \\"central to her purpose\\". Robert Scholes devoted a chapter in his 1967 book The Fabulators to The Unicorn. The variety of fabulation he attributes to the novel is allegory. He argues that while using \\"the conventions of English soft-boiled mystery fiction\\", Murdoch actually \\"toys with conventions\\". In his view, Marian and Effingham allegorically represent modern ideas and attitudes, while the Gaze household represents medieval Christianity and the Riders household headed by Max Lejour represents Platonic philosophy. A later academic interpretation of The Unicorn argues that Murdoch metafictionally deconstructs her own elaborately Gothic setting and story by encouraging the reader to see through the characters' self-deception.

It existed from 1955 to 1988. Since that time, Bible- Presbyterian (\\"B-P\\" or \\"BP\\") churches have continued to exist separately. The movement grew out of the Bible Presbyterian Church in the United States. , there were 20,000 members in 32 B‚ÄìP churches. Roland Chia suggests that the BPC was noted for a belief in literal six-day creation and a preference for the King James Version (\\"KJV\\"). History The BPC was founded in 1955 by Timothy Tow. Tow had been influenced first by John Sung, and later by Carl McIntire. He was strongly opposed to liberal theology and ecumenism, and the de-facto link of the English service he founded in 1950 in a Chinese Presbyterian church in the Chinese Presbyterian Synod that was connected to the World Council of Churches (\\"WCC\\") in promoting modernist ecumenism in opposition to the International Council of Christian Churches (\\"ICCC\\"). A conflict ensued and the English Service pastored by Tow in Life Church (ÁîüÂëΩÂ†Ç) or Say Mia Tng (Teochew dialect) at Prinsep Street (not to be confused with Prinsep Street Presbyterian Church) severed connections with the Synod in 1955 to form Life Bible-Presbyterian Church (\\"Life B‚ÄìP Church,\\" \\"Life BP Church\\" or \\"Life BPC\\"). In 1988, after experiencing a period of significant dissension, the Synod of the BPC voted to dissolve itself. According to Roland Chia, it was \\"mainly due to strong differences in interpreting the Doctrine of Biblical Separation, Fundamentalism, and Neo-Evangelicalism\\"‚Äîas in the statement issued by the BPC on 30 October 1988 describing the dissolution. Divisions =Fundamentalist and Evangelical= The B-P churches are essentially divided into two factions. One group of churches subscribes to the fundamentalist stance of the founders; the other considers itself to be evangelical. This latter group of churches is denounced by the former to be \\"neo-evangelical\\" or \\"liberal\\", and are often called \\"the new B-Ps\\" because of a different interpretation on the doctrine of \\"Biblical Separation\\". The evangelical branch of B-P churches embraces the fellowship of any church and seminary that professes evangelical Protestant Christianity and extends cooperation with para-church organizations like Campus Crusade for Christ International. Thus, many aspiring ministers prefer an evangelical seminary (such as Fuller Theological Seminary, Temple Baptist Seminary, Singapore Bible College, Trinity Theological College, Singapore or University of Nottingham) over the B-P's own seminary, Far Eastern Bible College (\\"FEBC\\"), which is fundamentalist.

The initiative uses a multi- pronged approach to achieve the overall aims of preventing and controlling malaria and reducing malaria-related morbidity and mortality in countries of the Americas. AMI priorities for malaria prevention are as follows, diagnosis and treatment, drug resistance and epidemiological surveillance, vector control, pharmaceutical management, quality of medicines, communication and networking.  History  The rationale for creating AMI was and still remains the need to provide and invest in targeted activities to improve malaria control in the Amazon basin countries where 88% of malaria cases in Latin America and the Caribbean are reported. The Americas also where medication used to treat P. falciparum malaria are being reported to be ineffective. Nearly 95% of the malaria burden in the Americas is located in the Amazon basin region, as well as 98% of the Plasmodium falciparum infection. When AMI first launched the initial participating countries included Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, Bolivia, and Venezuela. By 2008 Venezuela ceased participation, Bolivia followed in 2013. AMI later expanded to eleven countries adding Central American countries Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.  Description  AMI's approach to enhance malaria control in the eleven participating countries is to identify, support, and implement evidence-based interventions. AMI partners share knowledge and lessons learned by networking across different countries, both in the Americas and around the world. AMI hopes that all participating countries will develop strong health systems, strategic planning programs, monitoring, and evaluation, operational research and country level capacity-building. To achieve the malaria control objective, AMI has created the following set of goals and priorities. =Goals= #Ensure malaria control programs incorporate selected best practices #Improve malaria control at the sub-regional level #Contribute to decrease malaria morbidity and mortality =Priorities= Provide effective malaria control and treatment by: *Assessing efficacy of currently used medicines and suitable replacements *Choosing and implementing new treatment policies *Improving diagnostics quality assurance and quality control *Expanding access to diagnostics test and good quality antimalarial medicines * Strengthening vector surveillance and control and disseminating information Since AMI has been introduced, the Americas have seen a 60% decrease in reported cases and 70% decrease in death due to malaria. From 2007 to 2008 the Americas reported 30% less cases of malaria as well as a 52% decrease in mortality. By 2008, reports of fatal malaria cases dropped by 83%. There was a decline in incidence rate from 2000 to 2012 in 18 of the 21 endemic countries. By 2015 Brazil, Colombia, and Peru are estimated to achieve reduction of > 75%, while Panama is estimated to achieve a reduction of 25% to 50%. Guyana is the only participating country to report an increase in cases between the years 2000 and 2012. As of 2013 Belize moved from the control phase to the pre-elimination phase joining Ecuador, while the other endemic countries remain in the control phase. Admiral Tim Ziemer, U.S Global Malaria Coordinator, said the work of PAHO, WHO member countries and the U.S. (supported through the Amazon Malaria Initiative) have been critical to this success. Currently AMI is working on five priority areas for the AMI region: 1) consolidating the gains achieved during the first ten years of work and contributing further attention to P. vivax malaria and to populations with special needs; 2) making malaria control activities more feasible, independent of AMI contribution; 3) developing a regional approach to malaria prevention and control; 4) helping national malarial control programs contribute to the decentralization effect in the health sector as well as modifying malaria control strategies to divers and emerging epidemiological setting; 5) implementing the Strategy and Plan of Action for Malaria in the Americas for 2011-2015. = Strategy and plan of action for malaria = In September 2011, countries in the Americas approved a strategy and plan of action for malaria and established key targets for 2015. The Americas plan of action includes a 75% reduction in malaria morbidity as well as 25% reduction in malaria related deaths by 2015. The plan also calls to implement malaria elimination activities in areas where elimination seems possible, reverse trends in countries where malaria case were on the rise, and prevent any reintroduction of malaria in countries deemed malaria-free. A new multi-year strategy and plan of action will be presented to the 55th Directing Council in 2016. As part of strategic communication and advocacy on behalf of malaria control in the region, AMI partners participate in the commemoration of international awareness days such as World Malaria Day on April 25 and Malaria Day in the Americas on November 6.  Amazon Network for the Surveillance of Antimalarial Drug Resistance  Through its support for AMI, USAID helped the Pan American Health Organization to create the Amazon Network for the Surveillance of Antimalarial Drug Resistance (RAVREDA). The goal of RAVREDA is to use a network of sentinel sites to monitor medicine efficacy and address antimalarial drug resistance. RAVREDA first launched as an effort to support participating countries to revise their antimalarial drug treatment policies, and promote the implementation of science-based malaria control policies. RAVREDA is a country-led collaborative that monitors the emergence and spread of resistance to antimalarial medicines and addresses the risk of malaria reemergence. The AMI/RAVREDA has assisted countries in the region to develop drug efficacy protocols. REVREDA tailors to local epidemiological situations as well as conducts studies of therapeutic efficacy. The purpose of AMI/RAVREDA is to be the motivating role in partnerships, filling regional gaps, assisting regional and subregional coordination, supporting in the preparation of Global found applications, and creating a foundation for malaria elimination in areas where it seems feasible.

The oldest parts date from the 12th century, and the church has been little altered since the end of the 13th century. Its interior is richly decorated with medieval murals. It belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby. History and architecture The church is constructed of limestone. The oldest part of Ekeby Church is the tower, dating from the end of the 12th century and Romanesque in style. The nave and choir are circa one century younger and Gothic in style. At the end of the 13th century, the tower was also heightened to its present height. MThe two southern portals are richly decorated with sculptures. These were originally painted, and fragments of colour survive. Inside, the church is profusely decorated with medieval murals. The nave has murals from the 13th, 14th and 18th century, and the choir from the early 19th century in the form of blue trompe l'oeil draperies. Among the other murals, the large paintings depicting the apostles are the oldest, from the end of the 13th century. Under them are paintings done by the Master of the Passion of Christ depicting, on the northern wall, the Passion of Christ and, on the southern, the childhood of Jesus. During a renovation in 2004, further murals were discovered. Originally, all the windows had stained glass panes, but today only a few original remain. Three conserved windows with glass paintings are from the end of the 13th century. An unusual niche in the choir, probably designed as a storage for the bread and wine from the Eucharist, retains remarkably well-preserved paintings from the end of the 13th century. Among the furnishings, the accomplished Romanesque triumphal cross deserves mention. It is from the end of the 12th century. The sandstone baptismal font is also an unusual fine piece, from approximately the same time. Scholars believe that it may have been made by either Master Majestatis or Hegvald. The Church was restored in 1942-1943, under the direction of architect Olle Karth (1905-1965). An restoration of the exterior was also carried out in 1971-1972. It is associated with the Diocese of Visby of the Church of Sweden.

The Aspromontana is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders. At the end of 2013 the registered population was variously reported as 27,164 and as 26,249. Characteristics The Aspromonte goat is of medium size, standing about at the withers; average weight is for billies and for nannies. The head is small, with a straight profile. Both sexes usually have tassels and are bearded and horned. The horns are flattened and lyre-shaped, and have a tuft of hair between them. The ears are horizontal or erect; in a small percentage of cases the crop-eared mutation is seen. The abdomen is fairly large for the size of the animal, with a straight back, and a moderately sloping, developed rump). The udder of the female, with medium-sized teats, are firmly attached, similar to those of sheep, and only rarely pyriform. The hooves are long, with thick, dark soles. Males have larger heads and horns, stronger limbs, and coarser hair. The coat is long, with a Cashmere-type undercoat, and usually ruddy, but there are various colour variant classifications, including red-and-white, black-and-white, grey, brown, brown-and-red and particoloured. The skin is described as \\"fine and elastic\\", and usually matches the coat, though may range from pink to grey-black. The Aspromonte's annual fertility rate is (i.e. bred females who give birth) is 98%, with average age of first parturition of 15 months. Reproductive productivity is 148-159%, depending upon how calculated. Breeding goals are to improve prolificity (twinning rate) and the yield and quality of meat and milk. Some conformational defects, such as crop ear, are tolerated, while others, such as a short coat or a coarse or heavy head, are not. Uses The Aspromonte is a dual-purpose goat, raised both for meat and for milk. It is a frugal and hardy breed, and has an important role in vegetation management and maintenance of the mountain pastures of the Aspromonte massif, thus contributing to fire prevention, soil stability and the conservation of local biodiversity and the ecosystem. The minimum milk yield of Aspromonte nannies is 120 litres in 150 days for primiparous, 130 L in 160 days for secondiparous and 180 L in 210 days for pluriparous animals. Reported averages are, respectively, 140 L in 150 days, 150 L in 160 days, and 220 L in 210 days. The milk averages 3.95% fat, 3.57% protein and 4.63% lactose, and is used to make local cheeses of many kinds. These include, among others, caciotta, cacioricotta, canestrato dell'Aspromonte, caprino dell'Aspromonte, caprino di Limina, giuncata di capra, musulupu dell'Aspromonte, mixed-milk cheeses such as caciocavallo di Cimin√†, and various kinds of fresh, baked, smoked or salted ricotta. Many of these have PAT status as traditional products of the area. Consumption of goat's meat, particularly of adult nannies, is notably higher in the province of Reggio Calabria than anywhere else in Italy. Calabrian goat's meat has PAT status, and there are numerous traditional local goat's-meat dishes. Aspromonte kids weigh about at birth, and reach at 30 days.

The organization was founded in San Francisco in 1969 by George C. Kiskaddon, founder of Marine Chartering Company, and Dr. Jerold M. Lowenstein, director of the Pacific Institute of Nuclear Medicine.  Early history  After its foundation in 1969, Oceanic Society grew rapidly in the San Francisco Bay Area through membership drives, citizen science programs involving Bay Area yacht owners, and an Expeditions program. The organization's initial focus was on environmental issues in the Pacific Ocean, but the Bay Area chapter simultaneously sought to create a model that would be re-created by chapters worldwide. In 1974, Christopher du Pont Roosevelt, grandson of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, took on the leadership of Oceanic Society and served as the organization's president, CEO, and trustee until 1985. Under Roosevelt's leadership the organization moved its headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut and expanded nationally to more than 60,000 members in 5 chapters. = Oceanic Society Patrol = One of Oceanic Society's most important programs in its early years was the Oceanic Society Patrol, which was established In 1972 as a way to engage Bay Area yacht owners and pilots as volunteer participants in research and monitoring for ocean conservation. The Boat Patrol enlisted and trained private boat owners to monitor water quality, collect oceanographic data, monitor marine mammals and other species, transport biologists to the Farallon Islands (through the Farallon Patrol), document pollution events, and perform other tasks as volunteers at their own expense. Similarly, the Air Patrol of light plane flyers monitored enforcement of environmental regulations and pollution events, industry and shipping activity, and collected data on marine mammals. The Patrols also participated in education and outreach through lectures and by inviting volunteer participants aboard their craft. = Oceanic Society Expeditions = The Oceanic Society Expeditions program was formally established in 1972 to support the organization's efforts to ‚Ä≥create a more oceanic society.‚Ä≥ The Expeditions program allowed Oceanic Society's members to participate in ship-based expeditions around the world, sometimes accomplishing specific research objectives. Early Expeditions included New Zealand, Australia, Europe, the Caribbean, South and Central America, and the California coast. As Oceanic Society's membership grew, so did the demand for Expeditions, and the program was expanded to include many more destinations and departures. The Oceanic Society Expeditions program continues to this day, and includes eco-tourism programs and volunteer vacations to global destinations that include the Galapagos Islands, Palau, Raja Ampat, Belize, Kenya, the Polar Regions, and more. = California Whale Watching = Public interest in whale watching grew dramatically in the early 1970s as the ‚Ä≥Save the Whales‚Ä≥ movement brought global attention to the plight of these animals. Oceanic Society ran its first whale watching trip to the Farallon Islands in 1975 aboard a former Coast Guard Cutter, M/V Alert, and soon began to offer regular whale watching trips out of Sausalito, Pillar Point, and Bodega Bay, California, and eventually to Baja California out of San Diego. Oceanic Society continues to offer whale watching in the San Francisco Bay Area, with two separate whale watching seasons: 1) Gray whale watching from January through May, and 2) Farallon Islands whale watching from May through November. = Oceans Magazine = From 1974 to 1989, Oceanic Society published the popular and widely distributed Oceans Magazine, that featured articles, images, and maps pertaining to ocean research, exploration, and conservation issues, as well as updates about the work of Oceanic Society's chapters. Oceans Magazine was founded by Jack C. Reynolds and originally published by Trident Publishers, Inc. of San Diego, CA in January 1969. In the editorial of \\"Oceans\\" Magazine Volume 1, Number 1, publisher Jack Reynolds wrote, ‚Ä≥To effect a better world, it is our responsibility to educate ourselves in all facets of living, to be creative in philosophy, exploring, enterprise and leisure. On these premises, I launch Oceans Magazine.‚Ä≥ Oceanic Society took over the publication in 1974, publishing at first five, then six issues a year until April 1989 when publication ceased after the release of Volume 22, Number 1.  Current work  = Turneffe Atoll, Belize = Oceanic Society maintained a field research station at Blackbird Caye in Turneffe Atoll, Belize, from 2001 to 2016. The station served as a base for marine research, principally on bottlenose dolphins, Antillean manatees, sea turtles, American crocodiles, and other species, as well as long-term coral reef monitoring. = Ulithi Atoll, Micronesia = Since 2004, Oceanic Society has been assisting community-based marine conservation efforts in Ulithi Atoll in the Federated States of Micronesia. Oceanic Society's involvement in Ulithi began through support to a local sea turtle research and conservation program, and subsequently expanded to include a broader effort to sustainably manage Ulithi's marine resources.

His art serves the simple, neglected, homeless of existence. It features the fellows from the Nippon and other ships, marked by the hard life in ports as well as on board. His art shows the interiors of East End bars, where you get acquainted with the dark side of life. His art however isn't any 'social' art of the arrogant, placarding character there was so much of especially during the 1920s and 30s. It's social, not in attitude or trend, but with objectivity and revealing sharpness in the human portrayal that sometimes seems almost brutal - repulsive, but sadly true. Yet it's, however always carried by compassion. Never by sentimentality. This involves a simple statement of: 'Such is man'. But from the ravaged features, and the gout-ridden limbs stiff from work there's still a notion emanating of how man should look like and could look like.\\" Ekel√∂f, Gunnar, Torsten Billman, Konstrevy No. 5-6, Stockholm, 1942, p. 227.

Biography  = Early years = Born in Kullavik, Sweden, Torsten Billman disliked school, with the drawing lessons as the only exception. During a drawing lesson with a substitute teacher Torsten had on a piece of blotting paper drawn a detailed composition, which was supposed to represent an Indian with his tent and utensils. \\"After the teacher had inspected the pictures produced by the class, Torsten was called to his desk. He expected a sympathetic judgment from the teacher; yes, he also hoped that he might impress a certain girl in the class. So he stepped forward fearlessly. He had hardly reached the plattform when he received such a box on the ear that he fell to the floor. As he crestfallen rose to return to his own desk he was further rebuked by the teacher, who ordered him immediately to fling the drawing in the red-hot stove.\\" Sj√∂berg, Leif, Torsten Billman and the Wood Engraver's Art, The American Scandinavian Review, Vol. LXI, No. 2, June 1973, New York, N.Y., p. 163. \\"It was my first vernissage\\", said Torsten Billman.Montgomery, K√ºllike, Torsten Billman, Bildf√∂rlaget √ñppna √ñgon, Stockholm, 1986, p. 9. The father, Frans Ludwig Billman (1862‚Äì1930), was born in Berg' parish near Billingen. Here Torsten Billman's grandfather had worn himself out in the hell of a crofter's holding. Torsten's mother Maria (1870‚Äì1953), born Hultgren, came from Sk√∂vde. Both parents had grown up under very poor conditions in V√§sterg√∂tland. Frans Billman's great talent for tailoring allowed him, despite only 14 days of elementary school, go to Copenhagen and London to train himself to become a fine tailor. In the 1890s Frans and Maria moved to workingclass suburb Haga, Gothenburg. 1909 they moved, with their three-year-old daughter Ingegerd (b. 1906), to Kullavik (south of Gothenburg). In Kullavik Frans Billman opened his own tailor shop. Frans wished that Torsten also should become a tailor; so Torsten's artistic interest lay dormant after he finished school in 1924. Torsten also understood that the father got fewer and fewer customers, as more and more hand-tailors in the mid-1920s were knocked out by the expanding clothing industry. So for good reasons Torsten had no desire to become a tailor - he longed out, away! Lennervald, Dan, Torsten Billman, bildmakaren, published by Halland Art Museum and The Workers' Educational Association in Sweden, Kungsbacka, 2010, p. 12. What he looked for was both freedom and contact with human beings, work communion.Jungmarker, Gunnar, Torsten Billman, Folket i Bilds Konstklubb, Svenska M√§stargrafiker IV, Stockholm, 1956, p. 6. = Years at sea = Billman was 17 years old when he in Stockholm, 1926, signed on SS Valencia; a cargo- boat plying the Mediterranean.

Convention Fixing the Minimum Age for the Admission of Young Persons to Employment as Trimmers or Stokers. Entry into force: 20 Nov 1922. In 1927 he became a coal trimmer. His artistic awakening was on SS Nippon, in 1928, a bigger long-distance runner plying the Far East. With white school chalk he drew caricatures of his fellow seamen and officers on the soot-blackened walls and bulkheads of the stokehole. Drawings that evoked encouragement from the men in the forecastle and also from the officers.Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, p. 19. \\"That ship put my slumbering pictoral talent in motion. I documented and I stored images - this I understood afterwards\\", Billman recalls.Sj√∂berg, Leif, New York, 1973, p. 164. After the next ship SS Nordic, early in 1929, he told his sister, Ingegerd, that he wanted to become an artist.Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, p. 21. He worked on five different merchant ships 1926-1929 and 1932 as a deckhand (1926‚Äì27), coal trimmer and stoker. = First woodcut = Torsten Billman's cousin on his mother's side Nils Svahn (1890‚Äì1936) was an editorial cartoonist at the newspaper Social-Demokraten, in Stockholm 1920‚Äì29. During Torsten's visit in Stockholm in the autumn of 1929, Nils explained a little about the woodcut for Torsten. Returned to Kullavik from military service in the Navy in Karlskrona, as a stoker on 1929‚Äì30, he made his first woodcuts Hands (1930) and Thirst (1930) as an unemployed stoker.List of graphic artwork 1930-1988, has been made by curator K√ºllike Montgomery at Gothenburg Museum of Art and later also at Nationalmuseum's graphics department, Stockholm.

Billman had not been to any art museum or anything like that and he know nothing about woodcut technique, so his first wood engravings was cut out of the wood of a margarine case with an ordinary carpenter's knife.Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, p. 23. Artistically he was \\"the complete savage\\", but he became interested when he saw reproductions of Frans Masereel and K√§the Kollwitz and when he later saw lithographs by Honor√© Daumier it was a stirring experience for him.Hoppe, Ragnar & Wettergren, Erik (editors), Graphic Art In Sweden Today, P. & D. Colnaghi & Co. Ltd., 14 Old Bond Street, London, 1946, p. 16. Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, p. 23. The reproductions of Frans Masereel, K√§the Kollowitz and Honor√© Daumier were from the Swedish journals Tidevarvet and F√∂nstret, that his sister Ingegerd Billman had sent to him. = Images to union magazine = Torsten Billman's first published images (an ink drawing) was published in the November 1930 issue of the union magazine Eldaren (The Stoker). He also made a few covers for the union magazine Sj√∂mannen (The Sailor). His very last work of art was the Christmas 1988 issue cover.Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, p. 104, 108, 111. = Art studies = Upon the recommendation of a German woman in Kullavik he gained admittance in 1931 to The Industrial Arts School in Gothenburg, with Hjalmar Eldh as a teacher. Billman studied book illustration at the school. A good example of woodcut making from this period is A Fiddlers Burial (1931), inspired by a poem from collection of verse Black Ballades by the Swedish poet Dan Andersson. He also made five linoleum cuts (linocut) with which he illustrated Upton Sinclair's novel Jimmie Higgins (unpublished illustrations). A sympathy for the little fellow and the underprivileged is a pervading characteristic of all his graphic work from that time on. When Frans Billman died in 1930 the family had received some money on Frans' life insurance. During the second term at The Industrial Arts School Torsten Billman had no money left for the studies. One morning in April 1932, on the train from Kullavik to art school, Billman wrote to his sister about expensive water colours he can't afford to buy. Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, p. 28, 438. Letter to Ingegerd Billman from Torsten Billman 1932-04-19 (Torsten Billman estate). Billman tried to get work on a ship again. When he in the summer of 1932 signed on his last ship, SS Marie, he had bought some sketchbooks so that he could draw during the trip. With these drawings he was accepted, in 1933, as a student at Valand School of Fine Arts in Gothenburg. The teacher Sigfrid Ullman (1886‚Äì1960) early discovered Torsten Billman. Under Sigfrid Ullman's direction he was able to work according to his own intuition, and here he came on an even keel again. Torsten Billman left Valand 1934, after only three terms.Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, pp. 29 - 32. = Woodcuts made after the trip to Antwerp 1936 = In the spring of 1936 the Swedish composer G√∂sta Nystroem, that was curator at G√∂teborgs Konsthall 1934-36, organizes a scholarship to Billman. Billman was given the opportunity to study art in March and April in Antwerp. The journey gave inspiration for new motifs. But above all had the harbour environments strongly reminded him of his years as a sailor. Within a year after the trip he made some of his classic black and white woodcuts with sailor motifs such as: Through the Red Sea - Changing of the guard in the stokehole (1936) and The newly signed on sailors (1936), which is one of Billman's best-known woodcuts. About the woodcut Stoker watch goes over deck in the storm (1936/37) the artist said: \\"I remember the first scene I got inspiration from. It was when the watch came up and the boat was filled with water and there they stood up to their necks in water, so to speak. That I thought, I would try to portray. But it took many years. I had stored such motifs.\\" Ryndel, Nils (editor) & R√∂hlander, Bengt (producer), Bilder med s√§lta (Pictures with Saltiness).

Film by Sveriges Television (SVT), Stockholm 1984. = At the crossroads = Torsten Billman's girlfriend since 1933 (Valand School of Fine Art), Kristina Hedenstr√∂m (b. 1910), traveled to Paris in March 1938 to study art. Billman visited Paris in May and September 1938, and he met Swedes who had participated in the Spanish Civil War. The impressions from the journeys through Nazi Germany by train was a confirmation that a new major European war was imminent. During the visit in September he realized that their relationship was over ‚Äì Kristina's intension was to stay in Paris. In March 1939 Billman traveled to London. He made drawings for newspapers in Gothenburg and also visited Tate Gallery and The British Museum. In London he entered a planned marriage of convenience with a Jewish woman from Germany who intended to flee via Sweden. In mid-August 1939 Billman biked to Paris (from Gothenburg) to try to persuade Kristina to return to Sweden, when a major war in Europe seemed to be coming closer by the day. After a week in Paris World War II breaks out. The 10 September 700 Swedes were transported by train from Paris to Dieppe. From Dieppe they were evacuated by two Swedish hired boats ‚Äì over mined waters ‚Äì to Gothenburg. Kristina Hedenstr√∂m never returned to Sweden. She died in Paris in November 1943 only 33 years old.Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, pp. 36 - 39. = Anti-Nazi images = After the Valand period Billman worked sporadically as a drawer for G√∂teborgs Handels- och Sj√∂fartstidning 1934‚Äì40. The newspaper was led by the legendary editor-in- chief Torgny Segerstedt (1876‚Äì1945), which made the newspaper internationally known for his uncompromising anti-Nazi stance. Billman would later cooperate with Torgny Segerstedt's daughter the journalist and politician Ingrid Segerstedt Wiberg, which resulted in a buon fresco and a book etc. From 1936 until 1945 Billman made images (inkdrawings and woodcuts) against fascism and Nazism. Not many newspapers dared to publish them.Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, p. 66, 71. See: Satirarkivet, note 1. = Grisaille woodcuts 1940‚Äì45 = In a letter of November 1937, to art historian Gunnar Jungmarker (1902‚Äì1983) at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, Billman reveals that he is in an artistic crisis. The black and white woodcut restricts his expression - too brutal contrasts between black and white surfaces.Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, p. 436, 132. Letter to Gunnar Jungmarker from Torsten Billman 1937-10-27 and 1937-11-03. (Nationalmuseum). It was not until 1940 he was able to present a woodcut with several grey tones, developed from the ordinary black printing ink. Jungmarker called this type of woodcut: grisaille woodcut.Jungmarker, Gunnar, Stockholm, 1956, p. 26. A time-consuming printing process, exclusively for handprinting, with several grey-wood blocks (1-4) aside from the black and white key block. These first free grisaille woodcuts (made before the work with Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment, in 1945) are based on self- perceived events for example from Billman's sailor years 1926-32, European travels 1936-39 and trips around Sweden during the war years. Some shining grisaille woodcuts are French Restaurant (1940), Artist Family (1941), Wilderness Kitchen (1942), Around a Guitar Player (1942), Stairway in the South (1942), Stormy Day, Dieppe sept. 1939 (1944) or Tropical Harbour (1945).Hoppe, Ragnar & Wettergren, Erik (editors), Graphic Art In Sweden Today, London, 1946, p. 17. = Book illustrator = Torsten Billman made a name for himself with the ink drawings he made in 1941‚Äì43 to illustrate Harry Martinson's poetry collection Nomad (1931).Jaensson, Knut, Nya illustrerade b√∂cker (New illustrated books), Konstrevy, No. 1-2, Stockholm, 1944, pp. 59 - 60.Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, pp. 162 - 167. Harry Martinson, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1974, like Billman had been through the mill and worked as a seaman. The illustrated edition, with some new poems, was published in 1943 by Albert Bonniers f√∂rlag in Stockholm. Most impressive are his penetrating studies of the characters in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment. Billman's illustrations was published by Bonniers in 1948 and 1980. This consist of some 40 grisaille woodcuts. Art critic Tord Baeckstr√∂m in G√∂teborgs Handels- och Sj√∂fartstidning wrote about the grisaille woodcuts: \\"Billman concentrates the expression of a picture with remarkable assurance - with a few jabs of his iron he can summerize a face which speaks the poet's own language, an interior that breathes a hopeless misery, or a suggestion of a wintry street scene so that one feels the pull of Dostoevsky's prose.\\" Leif, Sj√∂berg, New York, 1973, p. 168. The publisher, collector and art connoisseur Gerard Bonnier (1917-1987) said about Billman's Dostoevsky-images: \\"I find them to be some of the best book illustrations made in Sweden during the 1900s.\\" Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, p. 443. Letter to Torsten Billman from Gerard Bonnier 1946-10-02 (Torsten Billman estate). In 1970 Billman illustrated Georg B√ºchner's tragedy Woyzeck with 24 woodcuts - another high point among his literary illustrations. Woyzeck the little man who is completely at the mercy of his capricious and cruel masters. \\"Billman squarely places social responsibility on himself as an artist: He clearly sides with the underdog.\\" Sj√∂berg, Leif, New York, 1973, p. 170. = Buon fresco painter = Between 1943 and 1949 Billman made his largest buon frescoes, in scope and artistic quality. When Billman 1943 was asked, by the ombudsman Knut Ring at Swedish Seafarers' Union and the art historian Carl Nordenfalk at Gothenburg Museum of Art, if he wanted to carry out a buon fresco on two walls of 20 metres in the New Seamen Homes ceremonial room, Billman had just worked with woodcuts and small ink illustrations.Nordenfalk, Carl, Torsten Billman, monumentalm√•lare och illustrat√∂r, Konstrevy No. 5‚Äì6, Stockholm, 1944, pp. 227‚Äì232. But 1943 Billman start to work on his first buon fresco painting To Sailors - Workers at Sea (1944) in Seamen's Home in Gothenburg. Billman depicts coal trimmer and stoker down in coal bunkers and stokeholes with self- perceived realism, which has not been previously seen in buon frescoes.Nordenfalk, Carl, Stockholm, 1944, p. 230, 232. There are also events from World War II, for example when Nazi aircraft attacking a merchant ship etc. Billman's fresco sketches for Development of Society was awarded first prize in Nationalmuseums major competition for public art in conjunction with the exhibition Good Art in Homes and Assembly Halls in Stockholm 1945. In 1947 the buon fresco was completed in The People's House in G√§vle. The buon fresco portrays key processes in Swedish history, from the 1870s (Modern Breakthrough) to the end of World War II. Billman have placed the socialist agitator August Palm (1849-1922) in the center of the fresco as a criticism to the labour movement's establishment about their forgotten history and heritage. The two other main figures in the G√§vle-fresco is the author August Strindberg, next to a scene from his novel The Red Room (Strindberg) and the publicist Torgny Segerstedt. The buon fresco In Front of Sm√•lands Taberg (1949) in The People's House in Norrahammar (outside J√∂nk√∂ping/Sweden) is Torsten Billman's work to the honour of labour. With realism, poetry and local colour Billman portrays a recognizable everyday work among the foundry workers in Norrahammar. = Grisaille woodcuts after 1963 = In 1963 Billman returns with his political satires Time Images. Billman had not made any \\"political\\" pictures since World War II. Billman use his developed grisaille-technique in prints such as: The Murder of Lee Oswald (1964), The Warren Commission (1964), Indian Appeals to Lincoln (1965), Mozart's funeral (1965),Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, pp. 279 - 284. The grisaille woodcut Mozart's funeral (1965) is Torsten Billman's paraphrase of Pierre-Roch Vigneron's (1789-1872) Le Convoi du Pauvre (1819). This sought after grisaille woodcut was printed by Torsten Billman only in a few copies. Party (1967) and Tear Gas in Paris (1968). In The Murder of Lee Oswald and The Warren Commission Torsten Billman incisively commented events in the wake of the assassination of president John F. Kennedy. The Murder of Lee Oswald uncovers, in the condensed black satire, complex links people only could sense but, then, couldn't put into words. Two pictures ‚Äì made when it happened ‚Äì who went against the grain of mainstream media and which today has a prophetic force.Lennervald, Dan, Kungsbacka, 2010, pp. 286 - 287. Bertrand Russell wrote appreciatively to Torsten Billman about these two grisaille woodcuts.Ryndel, Nils & R√∂hlander, Bengt, Sveriges Television (SVT), Stockholm, 1974.

She is the founder of the Garbage Patch State. Biography Finucci is married to the current Ambassador of Italy to the Holy See, Pietro Sebastiani. The couple has four children and four grandchildren. She attended the University of Florence graduating magna cum laude, writing her thesis about Charles Rennie Mackintosh. During her career as an architect, she has lived and worked in Moscow, New York, Paris, Brussels, and Madrid. Her projects have been published in various magazines and books.

In 2010, her work was featured in a solo exhibition titled Paradigms at the Lu.CCA Museum. =The Garbage Patch State project= In 2013 she began her monumental artistic cycle named Wasteland, a transmedia project confronting the problem of the huge islands of plastic garbage spread through the oceans, such as the Pacific Trash Vortex. The idea was to make this \\"territory\\" into a federal state. \\"Since the Garbage Patch keeps on being ignored by public opinion mainly because it is not visible, I came up with the idea of creating a State out of these islands completely formed by plastic wastes whose surface amounts to around sixteen million square kilometers\\" stated the artist. On 11 April 2013, with the General Director and other UNESCO authorities, Maria Cristina Finucci planted the flag of her new State and gave the inauguration speech of the Garbage Patch State. It marked the official beginning of the Wasteland cycle. During the Venice Biennale of 2013, the Garbage Patch State, like the majority of other states, had its own pavilion in the yard of the Ca‚Äô Foscari University. Thousands of colored plastic cups climbed over the walls surrounding the ancient building as if they were going to reach the lagoon. In 2014 the Garbage Patch State went to Madrid for ARCO, the international art fair, with a public installation on Gran V√≠a. This work consisted of a \\"sheet\\" made out of plastic bottles containing flower sprouts, that at night lit up with camera flashes. For the first National day of the Garbage Patch State, the artist inaugurated the first Embassy in the MAXXI Museum of Rome. She also realized a new installation consisting of a long plastic \\"wave\\" composed of thousands of fragments of recycled plastic bottles. From September to October 2014 the Garbage Patch State was hosted in the UN headquarters in New York. Among the collateral events of Milan EXPO 2015, the artist created a new installation \\"The Vortex\\", commissioned by Bracco Foundation. The Vortex is now part of the permanent collection of the Bracco Foundation. In the same year, the hall of the High Level Conference Bluemed for climate in Venice hosted a mysterious animal formed by plastic wastes from the oceans, the Bluemedsaurus. Crawling through the masses of wastes of the world, the plastic snake reached Paris to show itself to the heads of states present for the Climate Conference COP 21. The Wasteland cycle continues on the island of Mozia (Trapani), with a monumental installation consisting of five millions of plastic cups contained in metallic cages. The structure, seen from above, forms the word HELP. In June 2018, for World Oceans Day, Maria Cristina Finucci launched her latest work: a new HELP sign appeared in the Forum, Rome, as a sign of alarm to the millions of tourists visiting this famous archeological place.

Master of the Straus Madonna in the RKD He is possibly the same person as Cenni di Francesco di Ser Cenni. One of the most individual and lyrical Late Gothic Tuscan painters, he bridges the gap between Agnolo Gaddi and Lorenzo Monaco. His slender, pale figures blend spiritual evanescence with Giottesque solidity of form and are at their most expressive in the Man of Sorrows with Instruments of the Passion of c. 1395 and the Annunciation of c. 1405 (both Florence, Accademia), in which a highly refined sense of design balances perfectly with a poetic and vivid sense of colour. Striking touches of realism, as seen in the cockerel of the Passion or Gabriel's lilies, enliven these scenes. The subtly modelled Virgin and Child with Two Angels in the church at Sagginale (nr Borgo San Lorenzo), originally flanked by Sts John the Baptist and Dominic (both Oxford, Christ Church Picture Gallery), is one of the Master's finest mature works. Like Starnina and influenced in part by Spinello Aretino and the Giottesque revival, his graceful yet quietly compelling figures were important for the generation of Masolino in the last years of the Late Gothic style.

Breeze on drum programming arrangement; Eric Hurtig, Jay Henry, Dary Sulich, John Cicchetti, and Keith Friedman on engineering; Knut Bohn on engineering mixing; Mark Mandelbaum on mixing tracks B1 to B3; and production assistance by Boogie Down Productions. The release was met with lukewarm reception.  The Source  Shecter began The Source magazine in 1988 in Cambridge, MA with his roommate David Mays initially as an effort to promote his rap music radio show on WHRB 95.3 FM. Often cited as ‚ÄúThe Bible of Hip Hop,‚Äù the magazine devoted coverage to the rising rap and hip-hop music genres. Shecter served as editor-in-chief of The Source, while Mays handled publishing duties. While still in college, the two hired Harvard Law student James Bernard as senior editor overseeing culture-related content, and Ed Young as the associate publisher. The four men immediately became shareholders in the ownership of the magazine. Inspired by Rolling Stone, Spin, The Village Voice, and NME magazine, The Source carried the original tag line \\"The Voice of the Rap Music Industry.\\" The magazine originally attracted a younger audience, ages 12 and 13, and featured numerous reoccurring columns such as \\"Unsigned Hype\\", reporting on up-and-coming music artists. Throughout its years, The Source would go on to feature cover stories on the crack cocaine epidemic, police brutality, and New York‚Äôs investigations of high-profile emcees. The magazine's officers relocated to New York City in 1990 with the intention to expand the magazine into a mainstream market publication. The Source was re-branded as \\"Hip-Hop Music, Culture, and Politics\\", and Shecter brought on numerous additional staff including Matty C, Reef, Reggie Dennis, and Philadelphia childhood friend Chris \\"Cee\\" Wild. The team was known as the \\"Source Mind Squad.\\" Not long after the relocation to New York, Mays secured the magazine's first newsstand distribution agreement, quickly increasing the publication's distribution from 30,000 to 80,000. The first newsstand edition of The Source featured rap performer Tracy Lauren Marrow, also known as Ice-T, in New Jack City. The magazine was heavily funded by selling ad space throughout it, most notably the ongoing Tommy Boy ad. Tom Silverman and Monica Lynch are cited as being extremely supportive of The Source in its earliest days. Shecter is cited as one of the first to recognize the potential and talent of rap performer Christopher Wallace, also known as Notorious B.I.G. Shecter received an early recording of Wallace rapping over an instrumental of Big Daddy Kane's \\"Ain't No Half-Steppin'\\", and promoted the artist through the \\"Unsigned Hype\\" column of The Source. Performer and producer Sean John Combs contacted Shecter soon after to gather information on the artist with interest in signing him under his label. Occasionally The Source received backlash from the artists it covered due to negative reviews. Compton, California-based west coast hip hop artists Rodney-O & Joe Cooley openly criticized the magazine in 1993 for a poor review of their album Fuck New York. American hip hop group Public Enemy created a music video mocking Shecter and James Bernard after Bernard criticized their music in a recent article. As The Source became more popular, it started a touring show in New York City called The Source Tour, featuring artists such as Cypress Hill, Hit Squad, Redman, K-Solo, Das EFX, and many others. Shecter left The Source magazine in 1995 as Mays's Boston-based hip hop group The Almighty RSO and Raymond Scott, also known as Benzino, gained greater influence over the publication. The publication has over eight million subscribers worldwide and remains one of the most popular hip-hop magazines in the world.  Entrepreneur  Jonathan Shecter has launched a number of companies after his departure from The Source magazine in 1995. Inspired by Hugh Hefner and American television show Playboy After Dark, Shecter began Hip-Hop Honeys in 2003, a DVD series that mixed soft-core pornography with hip hop music and culture. Shecter also launched Game Recordings, a single-specializing label that was heavily influential in the careers of Royce da 5'9\\" and Purple City's Agallah. Shecter was also involved in the promotion of rapper Marshall Bruce Mathers III, also known as Eminem, early in his career. Shecter is the co- founder and president of Screen Werks, a DJ-centric video platform which creates music-driven original video production. Shecter has also invested in and helped start a number of websites connected to his various properties and partnerships, including those for Hip Hop Honeys, Money for Honeys, Urban DVD Club, and Hip Hop Site.  The Vegas years  Shecter relocated to Las Vegas from New York City in 2003, where he first began many of his start-ups including the Hip Hop Honeys DVD series. He was recognized as a dance music promoter and representative for numerous DJs throughout the city, including Mark Ronson, Stretch Armstrong, DJ Premier, Milo Berger, also known as DJ Mighty Mi of The High and Mighty, and brokered a deal for Adam Michael Goldstein, also known as DJ AM, with the Pure Group in 2006. DJ AM‚Äôs arrival in Las Vegas started a popular style of music in the city called ‚Äúmash-up‚Äù, which is a song created by blending two or more pre-recorded songs, usually by overlaying the vocal track of one song seamlessly over the instrumental track of another. The style was popular in Las Vegas for several years, and helped pave the way for Electronic Dance Music (or EDM), which became mainstream by 2012. Jonathan Shecter was an avid poker player in Las Vegas, participating in ten tournaments between April 9, 2005 and June 12, 2007; finishing in the top ten in three of the tournaments, top 20 in two of the tournaments, and top 30 in three of the tournaments. Shecter works with numerous up-and-coming artists in the Las Vegas area, including Philadelphia-born parody-artist Keith From Up Da Block.  Wynn Hotel career  Shecter currently serves as the Director of Programming for the Wynn Las Vegas nightclubs Surrender and Encore Beach Club. The clubs feature at least 34 musicians who perform often throughout the year, including Diplo, Avicii, Madeon, David Guetta, Zedd, and many others. Shecter has partnered with Ultra Music on numerous occasions to create compilation albums for the Wynn's nightclubs Surrender, Encore Beach Club, and Andrea's Restaurant. These albums are sold throughout retail outlets inside the Wynn Las Vegas. Shecter was instrumental in the development of a recording studio for the nightclub's resident DJs in late 2013. After requests from artists Diplo, R3hab, and Afrojack, the Wynn built the studio beneath the Encore Beach Club with the assisted guidance of local DJ, producer, and engineer Luca Pretolesi, also known as Digital Boy. The studio consists of a main control room, vocal booth, lounge, and support facilities.

The standards focus on the interoperability and discoverability of objects within the network, and treat media as first-class citizen. The standard also describes a programming methodology that allows objects to describe their behaviors (features) to other objects over the network and allows objects to change their behavior dynamically at runtime. Application developers developing to the SMPTE ST 2071 standards focus on writing their applications to the behaviors they wish to support and not the object or class of object that implements those behaviors. Media as a first-class citizen The SMPTE ST 2071 standards define media as a first-class citizen, changing the focus from controlling devices and services to controlling media. This paradigm shift provides a more natural method of discovering, managing, and manipulating media as it harmonizes the way media is controlled with the way that it is conceptually perceived. Features as first-class citizens The SMPTE ST 2071 standards define a development methodology that elevates features to a first-class citizen status, allowing for those features to be decoupled from the objects that implement them. The standard defines capabilities as uniquely identified features that may be defined through normative prose and/or interface definition languages, such as OMG IDL or WSDL, and consequently documented or registered within a repository to foster feature-level interoperability within heterogeneous environments. Interoperability and new applications The interoperable exchange of media requires common file formats, compression/encoding techniques, transport mechanisms, semantics, and a common means by which media can be discovered, located, accessed, and managed. The SMPTE ST 2071 suite of standards defines an open protocol for the control of objects within an Internet of Things with provisions for the representation and control of media as a first-class citizen. The SMPTE ST 2071 Media & Device Control standard also defines a new programming methodology by which complex behaviors can be modeled as sets of uniquely identified features, known as capabilities, and a framework by which the endpoints exposing these capabilities can be made discoverable. As with media, SMPTE ST 2071 elevates capabilities (features) to a first-class citizen status, allowing for those capabilities to be decoupled from the objects that expose them. This new methodology can be used to simplify existing applications by facilitating the discovery of media services within a local area network and/or the Cloud. New applications may also be written to control mediacentric objects (devices and services) without forehand knowledge of the implementation of those objects. Commands may also be embedded within media streams to facilitate the initiation of action within the receiving system if the capabilities are exposed by the receiving system or can be ignored if they are not. This may prove useful for the control of objects on the receiving end, such as the control of tactile devices or some yet to be identified application.

The bill would increase the size of the territory of the Northern Mariana Islands, start an energy plan for the areas, and expand turtle conservation efforts. The bill was introduced into and passed by the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Omnibus Territories Act of 2013 would convey to the government of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) submerged lands surrounding such Islands and extending three geographical miles outward from their coastlines. The bill would include the CNMI among the islands where the President may establish naval defensive sea areas and airspace reservations when necessary for national defense. The bill would amend the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 to add 2013 and 2015 as years in which there shall be no increase in the minimum wage applicable to the CNMI. The bill would revise the treatment of supplemental fees imposed for employment of nonimmigrant workers paid into the Treasury of the CNMI government for the purpose of funding ongoing vocational educational curricula and program development by CNMI educational entities to: (1) require such government to provide to the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) a plan for the expenditure of funds, a projection of the effectiveness of the expenditures in job placement of U.S. workers, and a report on changes in employment of U.S. workers attributable to prior year expenditures; and (2) require a biennial report by the Secretary on the effectiveness of meeting the goals set out in the CNMI's annual plan for the expenditure of funds.

The bill would expand marine turtle conservation assistance under the Marine Turtle Conservation Act of 2004 to include the United States and its territories. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on December 19, 2013. This is a public domain source. S. 1237 would amend laws concerning the territories of American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (collectively known as insular areas). The legislation would authorize federal agencies to waive the requirement to provide local matching funds to receive certain federal grants in the insular areas; the amount of the waiver could not exceed $500,000. The legislation also would create a fund that would pay compensation to people and their family members who were victims of the Japanese occupation of Guam during World War II. Finally, S. 1237 would require reports to the Congress by the United States Department of the Interior, the Government Accountability Office, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy concerning issues faced by the insular areas. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that enacting S. 1237 would increase net direct spending by about $20 million over the 2015-2024 period. Because the bill would affect direct spending, pay-as- you-go procedures apply. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues. Implementing the bill would increase spending subject to appropriation by about $1 million over the 2015-2019 period, assuming availability of appropriated funds. S. 1237 would impose no intergovernmental or private- sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Omnibus Territories Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States Senate on June 27, 2014 by Sen. Ron Wyden (D, OR). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. On June 18, 2014, the bill was passed with an amendment by the Senate by unanimous consent. Debate and discussion After the bill had been passed by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, it was amended on the Senate floor. The amendment removed the provisions of the bill that provided war claims to people for the World War II Japanese occupation of Guam and the provision that allowed the requirement than some federal grants be matched with local funds in order to be awarded. Guam's representative in Congress, Madeleine Bordallo, was \\"extremely disappointed\\" by this change and said that she was \\"committed to continuing our fight for war claims for our manamko despite all the obstacles the conservative Republicans continue to raise.\\" The changes were made so that the bill could pass by unanimous consent. In testimony about the bill, the Department of the Interior said that \\"despite the fact that the Department cannot support each and every provision, the bill gives and airing to important territorial issues of long standing.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas S. 1237 *beta.congress.gov S. 1237 *GovTrack.us S. 1237 *OpenCongress.org S. 1237 *WashingtonWatch.com S. 1237 *Congressional Budget Office's report on S. 1237 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Omnibus Territories Act of 2013"},{"id":"43088921","text":"Drawing of a peacock Hans Verhagen den Stommen or Hans Verhagen der Stomme (alternative spelling: Verhaghen) (c. 1540-1545 in Mechelen - c. 1600 in Antwerp) was a Flemish painter and draftsman whose exact drawings of animals were influential on other artists who regularly copied them.

There was also a painter called Hans Verhaghen from Mechelen who worked around 1600 in Rotterdam and Delft, who is believed to have painted cartoons for the tapestry works.

Oxford University Press. 18 June 2014 His nickname ‚Äò‚Äôden Stommen‚Äô‚Äô means 'mute' in Dutch and indicates that he may have been mute. Work Drawing of a stone marten He is mainly known for his animal drawings. The √ñsterreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna holds a codex of Naturstudien (studies of nature) that was once the property of Emperor Rudolf II. Four of the drawings in the folio are inscribed in the handwriting of the Flemish court painter Joris Hoefnagel attributing the drawings to a 'Hans Verhagen den stommen van Antwerpen'. Other than these four studies in the Naturstudien Codex, only 20 drawings by the same hand are known. These drawings which depict animals are kept at the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin. One drawing shows the elephant that was exhibited in Antwerp in the autumn of 1563. Hans Verhagen den Stommen shows very exact observation skills in his drawings. He usually drew animals in their characteristic outline or in complementary views using opaque colours. In his drawing of a stone marten included in the Naturstudien Codex, Verhagen neatly represents the individual hairs of the animal.Rebecca P. Brienen, From Brazil to Europe: the Zoological Drawings of Albert Eckhout and Georg Marcgraf, in: Karel A. E. Enenkel, Paulus Johannes Smith, Early Modern Zoology: The Construction of Animals in Science, Literature and the Visual Arts, Volume 7, Issue 1, BRILL, 2007, p. 295 His works can be regarded as the start of scientific animal illustration in Antwerp. His zoological reliability had a significant influence on other artists, such as Hans Bol and Joris Hoefnagel. Hoefnagel used some of the drawings of Verhagen as models for his four-volume manuscript of natural history miniatures. Anonymous artists working in the later 16th century and the early 17th also copied his work.

Published in 1996 it became an international bestseller due in large part to the humour and unabashed bravado the author uses to describe his life and the sheer scale of his drug deals involving, amongst others, the CIA, MI6, the IRA and the Mafia. The book received mostly positive reviews, though some critics were initially sceptical of some of the more outlandish details portrayed. It was adapted for film in 2010 as Mr. Nice. Overview Welsh born Marks began small scale dealing of hashish in the late 1960s whilst at Oxford University studying nuclear physics and, later, a postgraduate degree course in philosophy. His activities rapidly expanded after a chance meeting with a Pakistani supplier made him realise how lucrative drug smuggling could be. After teaming up with Jim McCann, a senior member of the IRA, his business was soon bringing in huge amounts of cash and he began setting up various legitimate businesses as a front, to launder the proceeds of his hashish smuggling. At one time he claims to have had 25 such companies, 89 phone lines and 43 aliases, including the name used for the title of this book, Mr. Nice, an alias he adopted after buying a passport from a convicted murderer of that name. Following his arrest in 1980 in a combined operation by British and Spanish police, Marks managed to avoid a lengthy sentence by claiming to be a spy for the British intelligence agency MI6. He was eventually caught again, this time by the American DEA, and sentenced to life in prison at Terre Haute federal penitentiary in Indiana. He was released after seven years and allowed to return to the UK. Film adaptation Mr. Nice, directed by Bernard Rose and starring Rhys Ifans and Chlo√´ Sevigny.

Juan Dom√≠nguez de Mendoza: Soldier and Frontiersman of the Spanish Southwest. 1627-1693. University of New Mexico Press. In addition, Father Perea, a priest, worked on the affairs of the province, occupying positions such as Commissioner of the Inquisition and a member of the Definitory, the standing committee of the custody. Meanwhile, Fray Francisco de Porras was assigned to the post of Custodio, taking the place of Perea, because he (even though he was an agent of the Inquisition) decided to remain in Moqui Village to continue with the conversion to Christianity of the indigenous population of the place. = Trade relations = On his way to New Mexico, Ceballos tried to trade with the natives of some villages with Franciscan missions, using the monks as their agents. When the Franciscans refused to accept the trade with the Native Americans, Ceballos threatened them if they refused to agree to the maintenance of their business relationships. Ceballos arrived in Sante Fe on 3 March 1632 after leaving Mexico City, and one of his first official acts was a sanction to avenge the death of two missionaries who had been killed on Zuni lands, Friars Letrado and Aivide. However, he tried to maintain his business, occupying the role of governor in order to enrich himself \\"by enlisting the assistance of the friars\\". Thus, Ceballos had numerous items that he had brought from Mexico City to sell to the Amerindians and the friars.Weber, David J. (Third edition, 1982). The Taos Trappers: The Fur Trade in the Far Southwest, 1540-1846. The University of Oklahoma Press. Page 19. According to Elizabeth Ann Harper John, he plundered New Mexico, expropriating the belongings of settlers and Native Americans. In addition, he traded in Santa Barbara \\"nine wagons load of loot\\" and most of the New Mexican livestock. Three years later, the population of New Mexico suffered hunger and disease.John, Elizabeth Ann Harper (Second edition, 1996). Storms Brewed in Other Men's Worlds: The Confrontation of Indians, Spanish, and French in the Southwest, 1540-1795. University of Oklahoma Press. Page 84. In 1633 Ceballos issued laws that banned the workshops in the encomiendas and the use of Native Americans for personal service. Also the King Charles II of Spain issued laws prohibiting work by Indigenous women and sons who had not yet the minimum age to pay taxes. However, the requirements of some laws were not clear. It was allowed the settlers to force the Native Americans to work in exchange a wages. Many of them were indebted to the settlers. Mayors and jailers forced the Native American prisoners to work for certain persons in the convents.New Mexico Office of the Historian: Francisco de la Mora y Ceballos. Retrieved on June 18, 2014. In addition, Ceballos established the obligation to pay taxes to New Mexico on \\"wheat, corn, cassava, fish, cotton, vegetables, or anything else\\". In addition, it was recommended that government officials in the province call a meeting of the royal officials, prelates, the bishop, and some \\"disinterested\\" persons to discuss the issue and decide the amount of money that people had to pay through tributes. The trustees were supposed to obey the decision by law, and their salary would be limited to the amount that had been set. However, the civil authorities and parts of the church disobeyed those laws, due, respectively, to the \\"selfishness\\" and \\"jealousy\\" that they had. Francisco de la Mora y Ceballos was replaced by Francisco Mart√≠nez de Baeza in 1635, returning (probably) to modern Mexico sometime in this year.

At Cambridge, rich charming and good looking he may have outshone even Byron, who was to remain a lifelong friend, by his conscious adoption of immense style, his wit and pretensions to grandeur. Extremely well read in the classics, including the classical writers of Egypt and Nubia. He left a potential career in Parliament to follow in the steps of Byron and William Beckford to Spain and Portugal to pursue and Bohemian lifestyle among the gypsies of Granada and then for the risk and adventure of travel in the Near East.‚Äù\\"Paul Starkey et al, ‚ÄúTravellers In Egypt‚Äù, p. 51.

Life One of the twelve sons of Sir Lawrence Hyde of Salisbury, he was educated at Westminster School, and then elected in 1625 to Trinity College, Cambridge. He became fellow of his college, was appointed tutor 1636, and proceeded M.A. 1637. He was created D.D. of Oxford University in January 1642‚Äì3. Hyde was presented to the rectory of Brightwell-cum-Sotwell, in Berkshire, but after 1645 the living was sequestered from him for \\"scandal in life and disaffection to the Parliament\\". By an order of the parliamentary committee, dated 8 March 1649, he was granted a fifth of the annual value of the living for the support of his family, but his successor, John Ley, succeeded in obtaining a dispensation from this payment in 1652, on the ground that Hyde was possessed of lands and woods in Wiltshire, and that his wife's father was wealthy. The matter was publicised by John Ley in An Acquittance or Discharge from Dr. E. H. his Demand of a Fifth Part of the Rectory of Br. in Barks, 1654, which included An Apologie against the Doctors Defamations ‚Ä¶ at Oxford and elsewhere, and A Preparative to further Contestation about other Differences. It was followed in 1655 by General Reasons ‚Ä¶ against the Defalcation of a Fifth Part of the Minister's Maintenance, ‚Ä¶ whereto are added particular Reasons against the Payment ‚Ä¶ to Dr. E. H. ‚Ä¶ Together with an Answer to a Letter of the said Dr. E. H., occasioned by the late Insurrection at Salisbury. A version of the \\"further Contestation\\" is thought to be referenced in A Debate concerning the English Liturgy ‚Ä¶ drawn out in two English and two Latine Epistles written betwixt Edward Hyde, D.D., and John Ley, published by Ley in 1656. Hyde retired from Brightwell to Oxford, and resided in the precincts of Hart Hall. He studied in the Bodleian Library, and preached in Holywell church in the suburbs till silenced by adverse opinion. In 1658 he obtained through the influence of his exiled kinsman Edward Hyde, letters patent for the deanery of Windsor, but died 16 August 1659 at Salisbury. He was buried in Salisbury Cathedral. Works Hyde was the author of: *A Wonder and yet no Wonder: a great Red Dragon in Heaven, London, 1651. *The Mystery of Christ in us, London, 1651. This consists of six sermons on various topics. *A Christian Legacy, consisting of two parts: i. A Preparation for Death, ii. A Consolation against Death, Oxford, 1657. *Christ and his Church, or Christianity explained, under seven Evangelical and Ecclesiastical Heads, &c.; With a Justification of the Church of England, London, 1658. *A Christian Vindication of Truth against Errour, concerning these Seven Controversies, London, 1659. The book is against \\"G.B.\\", who had written on the Roman Catholic side against the English church. After Hyde's death, Richard Boreman edited two works left in manuscript: *The True Catholick's Tenure, or a good Christian's Certainty, which he ought to have of his Religion, and may have of his Salvation, Cambridge, 1662. *Allegiance and Conscience not fled out of England, or the Doctrine of the Church of England concerning Allegiance and Supremacy: as it was delivered by the former Author upon the occasion and at the time of trying the King by his own Subjects; in several Sermons, anno 1649, Cambridge, 1662. A Latin poem by Hyde is prefixed to James Duport's translation of The Book of Job into Greek verse (1637), and he contributed to the Cambridge Poems some verses in celebration of the birth of the Princess Elizabeth (1635).

Formula The SET rate follows the inverse of the fourth power of the distance :k_{SET}=({{1}/{\\\\tau _{D}})({d_{0}}/{d})^{4}} where \\\\tau _{D} is the donor emission lifetime, d is the distance between donor-acceptor, and d_{0} is the distance at which SET efficiency decreases to 50% (i.e., equal probability of energy transfer and spontaneous emission). Efficiency The energy transfer efficiency also follows a similar form :\\\\phi _{SET}=\\\\frac{1}{1+({d}/{d_{0}})^{4}} Due to the fourth power dependence SET can cover a distance more than 15 nm, which is almost twice the efficiency of FRET. Theoretically predicted in 1978 by Chance et al. it was proved experimentally in 2000s by different workers. Applications The efficiency of SET as nanoruler has been used in live cells.

Lytton & Co., nicknamed The Hub and Lytton's, was a department store chain headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The first store opened on State Street in 1887 and the last store closed in 1986. History Henry Charles Lytton first opened a store in Ionia, Michigan, but it proved unprofitable. Later forays in Grand Rapids, Michigan and Indianapolis, Indiana provided Lytton with enough capital to open a store in the Loop of Chicago, Illinois. The store, which he nicknamed The Hub, opened in 1887 on the corner of Jackson and State Streets in the Otis Building. It specialized in mass- produced menswear, a rarity at the time. In 1913, the store moved across the street into a new eighteen-story skyscraper known as the Lytton Store Building. Designed by Marshall & Fox, The Hub used the lower eight floors and both basements. The store then began to sell sporting goods. Lytton retired in 1917 and his son George took over. Henry would return to the head of the company in 1933 when George died. In 1934, Lytton opened a store at the Century of Progress world's fair. By the late 1930s, The Hub had branches in Evanston, Illinois; Oak Park, Illinois; and Gary, Indiana. The company grossed $19 million in 1946. Also that year, the company name was officially changed to Henry C. Lytton & Co. to commemorate Lytton's 100th birthday. Lytton remained president until his death in 1947 at age 101. The chain was purchased by Thomas Raffery, the former head of Venture Stores, and Matthew Kallman, formerly of Stix Baer & Fuller, in 1983. The firm, then consisting of twelve stores, went bankrupt the next March. Nine of its branches were then dissolved to raise money to maintain the flagship store on State Street. The company went out of business in 1986. Wieboldt's, another Chicago department store chain bought the Lytton's name as well as their remaining inventory. They had planned to relaunch Lytton's but never happened as Wieboldt's also filed for bankruptcy and subsequently went out of business in 1987. The store building is now owned and used by DePaul University and is part of the Loop Retail Historic District.

It houses a wide range of materials, including original biographical profiles, oral history interview transcripts, video content, timelines, bibliographies, teaching resources, and an original 40-minute documentary on the emergence and current status of feminist psychology in the United States. The project is continually expanding and currently has a database containing the profiles of over 250 psychologists from around the world. PFV is also an online teaching resource, with sample syllabi for teaching history of psychology from a feminist perspective, teaching guides for incorporating PFV material into history and psychology of gender courses, assignments, handouts, and teaching videos. PFV is a free resource and all interview transcripts are downloadable as .pdf files; all video content is available at the site and at the psychsfeministvoices YouTube channel; all interview transcripts are copyrighted to Feminist Voices except where indicated.  History  The Psychology's Feminist Voices project was founded by Alexandra Rutherford in 2004. It began as a collection of oral histories with contemporary feminist psychologists, many of whom established the field of feminist psychology in the United States and Canada in the early 1970s. It quickly expanded, however, to encompass a larger goal: the documentation of women throughout psychology's history, as well as a large and diverse sample of feminist psychologists in order to create a comprehensive picture of the impact of gender, women's participation, and feminism, on the development of psychology as a science and profession. The online resource, www.feministvoices.com, was launched in 2010 and now has a corresponding Facebook site, YouTube channel, and Twitter feed. This project is based at York University, Toronto, Canada. It has received funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, and has been endorsed by the Society for the Psychology of Women, Division 35 of the American Psychological Association (APA), the Society for the History of Psychology, Division 26 of the APA, the Section on Women and Psychology of the Canadian Psychological Association, and the Association for Women in Psychology.  Structure  The Psychology's Feminist Voices digital archive has two main sections: Women Past (1848-1950) and Feminist Presence(1950-). The Women Past section contains profiles of women who received their doctoral degrees in psychology before 1950. The Feminist Presence section features profiles of and interviews with self-identified feminist psychologists who received their doctorates after 1950. Both sections contain the following subsections: Profiles: Each psychologist has a profile page containing their training, affiliations, biographies, media links, photographs, and a list of selected works. The Feminist Presence profiles also usually include transcripts and video clips of interviews conducted by the PFV team. Timeline: Provides a chronology of major events in feminist history and psychology, beginning with the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention up to recent breakthroughs such as the publication of the report on the trafficking of women and girls by The Society for the Psychology of Women Special Committee. Resources: Includes bibliographies, teaching materials, websites, and archives with relevant collections. All of these resources are meant to serve as starting points for teaching and research on the history of women in psychology and science, as well as the history of feminism. An original teaching video series, \\"Feminist Psychologists Talk About...\\" is also featured. The first video in the series is on women's mental health and feminist therapy. Search Page: The content of the site is searchable by keyword, name, birth and death dates, training location, and affiliation. This page also includes a rotating banner of ‚ÄúFeatured Psychologists.‚Äù = Additional Content = Video Resources: The Changing Face of Feminist Psychology is an original documentary that uses archival material and interviews to explore the context in which feminist psychology emerged and how it has shaped the field of psychology.

The Manche Ch ºol took the name Manche from the name of their main settlement. They were the last group of eastern Cholan-speakers to remain independent and ethnically distinct. It is likely that they were descended from the inhabitants of Classic period (c. 250-900 AD) Maya cities in the southeastern Maya region, such as Nim Li Punit, Cop√°n and Quirigu√°. The first Spanish contact with the Manche Ch ºol was in 1525, when an expedition led by Hern√°n Cort√©s crossed their territory. From the early 17th century onwards, Dominican friars attempted to concentrate the Manche into mission towns and convert them to Christianity. These attempts alarmed their warlike Itza neighbours to the northwest, who attacked the mission towns and fomented rebellion among the Manche. The Manche Ch ºol in the mission towns were badly affected by disease, which also encouraged them to flee the towns. In the late 17th century, Franciscan missionaries argued that further attempts at peaceful pacification of the Ch ºol were useless and argued for armed intervention against the Manche Ch ºol and their Lakandon Ch ºol neighbours. The Manche were forcibly relocated in the Guatemalan Highlands, where they did not prosper. By 1770, most of the Manche Ch ºol were extinct. The few survivors were soon absorbed into the surrounding Q ºeqch ºi Maya population. Language Spanish colonial documents refer to the inhabitants of a broad swathe of territory as Chols or Cholans; this territory extended from the Laguna de T√©rminos through the Lacandon Jungle across the foothills of the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes eastwards to southern Belize. A number of distinct Chol- or Cholan-speaking groups inhabited this area; the Manche Ch ºol were just one of these groups and spoke the now extinct Ch ºolti º language. Ch ºolti º was descended from the Classic Maya language used in hieroglyphic texts. Ch ºolti º was very closely related to the Ch ºol, Cholan and Ch ºorti º languages. The Ch ºolti º language is evidenced from a single document written in the late 17th century in the Manche Ch ºol territory; it has been held in the library of the American Philosophical Society since the 19th century. The document is the Arte y vocabulario de la lengua Cholti, 1695 by Spanish friar Francisco Mor√°n, with the catalogue number Mss.497.4.M79. It was compiled in the Manche village San Lucas Tzalac. The term manche, is derived from the elements men, meaning \\"artisan\\", and che, meaning either \\"tribe\\" or \\"tree\\"; it was the name of a large Manche Ch ºol settlement. Territory Principal settlements, neighbours and trading partners of the Manche Ch ºol The Manche Ch ºol inhabited the southern Pet√©n Basin, southern Belize, and the area around Lake Izabal. Their territory consisted of tropical rainforest upon a low-lying limestone plain, crossed by fast-flowing rivers. It also featured small areas of savannah and extensive swamps. The Manche Ch ºol occupied a frontier region between the jurisdictions of the Spanish colonial authorities in Yucat√°n and Guatemala. The Manche Ch ºol had frequent contact with the inhabitants of Cahab√≥n, to the southwest, which continued after Cahab√≥n was incorporated into the Spanish Empire. The Manche Ch ºol were bordered to the north by the Mopan Maya and to the west by the Acala Maya, who were probably another Ch ºol-speaking group. Further west were the Lakandon Ch ºol, occupying land around the tributaries of the upper Usumacinta River. To the northwest of the Manche Ch ºol were the Itza, with their territory centered upon their island capital of Nojpet√©n, upon Lake Pet√©n Itz√°. To the east, the Manche Ch ºol bordered the Caribbean Sea, and in the 17th century Dominican friar Joseph Delgado mentioned that the Manche Ch ºol had settlements scattered along the Caribbean coast almost as far north as Bacalar, now within the borders of Quintana Roo state in southeastern Mexico. Settlements on the Caribbean coast in the early 17th century included Yaxhal, Paliac, Campin and Tzoite. There were further towns in the Cancu√©n River drainage, including Manche (renamed San Miguel Manch√© by the Spanish), Chocahau, Yaxha (colonial San Pablo Yaxh√°) and Yol (colonial Santo Domingo Yol). The closest Manche town to colonial Verapaz was Tzalac (referred to as San Lucas Salac by the Spanish), from Cahab√≥n. This was a large Manche settlement on the Sarstoon River, close to the Gracias a D√≠os rapids. Society Men either went naked or wore cloths covering their lower regions; women wore fine skirts woven from cotton, and some used a fine white cloth to cover their head and chest. The Manche Ch ºol, based on their distinctive attire, in particular their turban-style headdresses, were probably descended from the Classic period inhabitants of the region; similar headdresses were illustrated in Classic Maya art from Nim Li Punit and such headdresses were restricted to the southeastern Maya lowlands and were used at cities such as Cop√°n, Quirigu√°, and their satellites. Manche Ch ºol men grew their hair long; they were forced to cut it short upon their evangelisation and this caused much ill-feeling. The Manche Ch ºol practised polygamy; converted Manche men were forced to give up all their wives except one. This was said to have caused such distress among some Manche men relocated to the Guatemalan Highlands that they were reported to have died. The Manche Ch ºol subsisted upon a maize-based diet; maize was mostly consumed in liquid form, such as in posole, and was probably eaten as tamales. The Manche diet also included beans, chilli, sweet potato and turkey. Plantain and sugar cane were introduced to the Manche after European contact. The Manche Ch ºol used a variation of the Maya calendar, using a 365-day year divided into eighteen 20-day \\"months\\" and ending with a 5-day unlucky period. They worshipped a number of nature-based Maya deities, particularly gods of mountains and dangerous mountain passes, gods of rivers and whirlpools, and of crossroads. One named god was Escurruchan or Xcarruchan, a mountain god that was said to inhabit a mountain top close to the Gracias a D√≠os waterfall on the Sarstoon River. On top of the mountain was a well-kept plaza with a fire that was kept permanently lit so travellers could make offerings of copal incense. Another mountain god was called Vatanchu, which translates as \\"straight god\\", who inhabited a peak on the road from Chulul to Manche. The Manche Ch ºol god of death and the underworld was called Cizin. In 1635 Mart√≠n Tovilla, governor of Verapaz, related that the principal gods of the Manche were called Canam, Man, and Chuemexchel. He reported that Manche priests dressed in finely painted vestments fashioned from tree bark. Priests were served during rituals by young women wearing feathers, garlands and necklaces. The Manche offered sacrifices to their deities that included copal incense, turkeys and human blood, both from personal bloodletting and from human sacrifice. Organisation and commerce The Manche Ch ºol lacked a complex political organisation, and possessed no large towns within their territory. Their largest settlement was Manche itself, with about one hundred multi-family houses. Manche was also the name of the principal lineage at Manche and this lineage was the origin of the populations of the other Manche Ch ºol towns. Nito was another principal settlement, and an important port for maritime trade that maintained strong links with places as far away as the province of Acalan in what is now southern Campeche in Mexico. Otherwise, the Manche Ch ºol lived in generally small settlements governed by one or more chieftains; they were less politically complex than their Lakandon and Itza neighbours, and were not ruled by a principal king or chieftain. They grew relatively little maize, rather concentrating their agricultural production upon the prestige crops of cacao, annatto and vanilla. All the main settlements, both on the coast and inland, were noted for their prodigious cacao and annatto plantations. The Manche Ch ºol were integrated into a regional trade network that included their Itza and Lakandon Ch ºol neighbours, and involved the exchange of Manche produce such as cacao, annatto and vanilla for salt, the only Maya source of which was controlled by the Itza after the Spanish conquest of the province of Acalan. This trade monopoly was maintained by force on the part of the Itza, who vigorously ensured that the Manche Ch ºol remained subservient to them. After the Manche towns on the coast of Belize fell under Spanish control in the 16th century, they continued to have close links with the independent inland Manche settlements. Trade continued and intermarriage was common. The towns in the Cancu√©n River drainage traded via land and riverine routes with both the independent Itza (notably with Nojpet√©n) and with colonial Verapaz (principally with Cob√°n and Cahab√≥n). There were two main trade routes used by the Manche Ch ºol; the first went north along the Mopan River to Chacchilan, then overland to Nojpet√©n. The second followed the Cancu√©n River to Yol, and there joined the Pasi√≥n River northwards, leaving the river when it turned west and continuing overland to Nojpet√©n. Xocmo, on the Sacapulas River, was a trading port where the Manche and Lakandon Ch ºols met to trade cacao and annatto. Xocmo had a major fair, still taking place as late as 1676, where traders arrived from various colonial and independent settlements; these included Nojpet√©n and the towns of Cob√°n, San Agust√≠n Lanqu√≠n and Sacapulas in colonial Verapaz. The Chols traded cacao and annatto into the encomienda towns of Verapaz in exchange for metal tools (particularly axes and machetes) and salt. Other products traded to the Manche by the Q ºeqchi º of colonial Verapaz included cotton textiles and quetzal feathers. The Q ºeqchi º used this trade to supply products demanded by their Spanish overlords under the repartimiento system. The Manche produced a number of products for trade, manufactured from resources in the southern Maya Mountains of Belize; these included blowguns, bows and arrows, finely sculpted greenstone axes, hammocks, manos and metates, pottery, and cane, all of which were traded across the southern Maya region. Spanish contact Conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s passed through Manche Ch ºol territory in 1525, and described it as sparsely populated. In the 16th century, the coastal towns of Campin and Tzoite were given in encomienda to Hernando S√°nchez de Aguilar; they fell within the jurisdiction of colonial Bacalar, on the Yucat√°n coast near Chetumal. Although some Manche Ch ºols visited the Dominican friars in Cob√°n, Verapaz, in 1564, the central Manche were not contacted by the Spanish again until 1603, when Dominican missionaries first attempted to evangelise them, and started to gather the scattered inhabitants into towns. In the second half of the 16th century, the still-independent Manche Ch ºol became a refuge for Christianised Maya living under Spanish domination in Verapaz, who wished to escape and live as apostates among them and their Lakandon Ch ºol neighbours. In 1596, Dominican friar Juan Esguerra reported seeing eleven Manche traders in Cahab√≥n; he claimed that the Manche Ch ºol were frequent visitors to the town. In 1600 the regular presence of Manche Ch ºol traders in Cahab√≥n was again reported, and they were said to arrive in greater numbers for the town's festivities in honour of its patron saint. Friar Esguerra complained in 1605 of the great number of Christianised Q ºeqchi º Maya of Cahab√≥n that were fleeing the town to live as apostates among the Manche Ch ºol. By 1606 the missionaries had concentrated many Manche Ch ºols in nine new mission towns, and had started to penetrate the territory of the neighbouring Mopan Maya, who were on the borders of the fiercely independent Itza of central Pet√©n. By 1628 the Dominicans were tending to 6,000 Maya in the part of Manche Ch ºol territory that they had gained access to. This figure included some apostate refugees from Spanish-controlled Cahab√≥n. Estimates of the total Manche Ch ºol population in the mid-17th century vary from 10,000 to 30,000, with prominent 20th-century Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson preferring the lower figure as opposed to the high-end estimates by 17th-century chroniclers. The Dominican penetration of Mopan territory alarmed the Itza, who started to harass the Manche Ch ºol, driving them away from the mission towns. In spite of the Dominicans' successes among the Manche in the early 17th century, they suffered a serious setback in the early 1630s when the Itza and Mopan attacked the Manche Ch ºol mission towns, driving out the Dominicans for decades. The Dominicans returned in the 1670s and were able to re-establish several missions in the region. In the late 17th century, the Spanish friars complained of the infidelity of the Manche; that they were quick to adopt Christianity and equally quick to abandon it. Friar Francisco Gallegos complained that trying to concentrate the Manche in mission towns was \\"like keeping birds in the forest without a cage\\". Due to the historical links between the Manche Ch ºol and the inhabitants of Spanish Cahab√≥n, the Spanish colonial authorities used the Maya inhabitants of Cahab√≥n as guides, interpreters and lay preachers in their attempts to bring the Manche within the empire. By the 1670s the Manche Ch ºol were in a difficult position, on the one side forced to bow to Itza trade demands under the threat of armed reprisals, and on the other side forced into extortionate trade with the Spanish encomienda towns. In the late 1670s, Sebasti√°n de Olivera, alcalde mayor (governor) of Verapaz, imposed compulsory trade prices upon the Manche Ch ºol, forcing one town to buy 70 machetes at 2.5 times the going price, paid in cacao. Refusal to trade was met with violence, and if the Manche could not afford the price demanded then Olivera's representatives would seize goods, clothing, poultry and previously traded metal tools. In 1684 three Franciscan friars were killed during an attempt to evangelise the inhabitants of Paliac. The three missionaries had been accompanying a Spanish expedition to collect valuable cacao; the expedition is likely to have involved considerable Spanish violence. It is likely that the friars were sacrificed by cutting out their hearts. Extinction In 1678 the Manche Ch ºol population was devastated by disease; in the area around the town of San Lucas Tzalac it killed every child under six years old and almost all of those under the age of ten. Total deaths, including adults, numbered over 400 and the epidemic prompted all the Manche Ch ºol in the affected region to abandon the mission towns and flee into the forest. The Spanish made a number of further attempts to pacify the Manche Ch ºol, but these were ultimately unsuccessful, and the Manche Ch ºol rebelled in 1689. In that year many Manche Ch ºol were forcibly relocated to the Urr√°n Valley in the highlands, resulting in the abandonment of many of the Manche orchards; this eventually led to the collapse of the regional trade network that by then had been fully linked with colonial Guatemala and supplied it with unknown quantities of cacao. In 1694, two Franciscan friars set out from Guatemala to see if they could succeed where the Dominicans had failed. Antonio Margil and Melchor L√≥pez left Cob√°n in August 1693 to seek out the hostile Lakandon Ch ºols in the depths of the rainforest. Antionio Margil had already spent two years among the Manche Ch ºol. Although they found the Lakandon, the mission was a failure and the friars were forced to flee. Disappointed by their failure, in April 1694 the friars wrote a letter to the president of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, Jacinto de Barrios Leal, stating their belief that any further peaceful attempts at converting the Ch ºol peoples were pointless, and that the time had come for military action. The conquering Spanish carried out several operations to relocate the Manche to Alta Verapaz, with their relocation being completed in 1697, a short time after the Spanish finally defeated their Itza Maya neighbours to the northwest. Most of the surviving Manche Ch ºol were forcibly resettled in the Guatemalan Highlands, in the villages of El Chol and Bel√©n, in the Urran Valley near Rabinal. The resettled Manche Ch ºol suffered from the abrupt change of climate from tropical lowland rain forest to the cold highlands. They were often not provided with suitable clothing by their Spanish overlords, and many died. The depopulation of the Manche and Lakandon Ch ºol lands, and the resulting collapse of long-standing trade routes, resulted in the gradual impoverishment of colonial Verapaz. In 1699 a Spanish expedition under the command of sergeant Mart√≠n de Montoya was sent from the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza (formerly Nojpet√©n) to investigate Indian activity in the former Ch ºol and Mopan territories. He found evidence that there were still surviving Maya in all the lands he crossed, as evidenced by the carefully tended cacao and vanilla orchards. At this time there were said to be 400 relocated Maya from the same area living in Bel√©n. By 1710 the population of Manche Ch ºol in Bel√©n had fallen to just four; everyone else had died as a result of disease, hunger and melancholy. By 1770 the Manche Ch ºol were all but extinct; their original territory had been abandoned and had reverted to wilderness, and the few survivors relocated to the highlands numbered not more than 300 in the whole Urran Valley, where there were almost as many Spanish and ladinos. Many Manche Ch ºol in Verapaz were absorbed into the expanding Q ºeqchi º Maya population, which gradually occupied the vacated Manche lands. It is possible that a few Manche Ch ºol survived in the forested interior of Toledo District in Belize, to be later absorbed by incoming Q ºeqchi º in the late 19th century. In the very early part of the 19th century, a handful of Maya were still recorded as speaking Ch ºol in Cob√°n. Legacy The highly specialised Manche production methods for annatto, cacao and vanilla were adopted by the incoming Q ºeqchi º and are still applied on a small scale. Among the modern-day Q ºeqchi º, a tradition still exists that these orchards belong to their ancestors, the ch ºolcuink spirits, who lack salt and swap cacao for it.

He was head of the fine art department at the Central School of Art and Design in London from 1971 to 1975, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1973.  Life  Clatworthy's Bull in the Alton Estate council housing estate in Roehampton, in south-west London Clatworthy was born at Bridgwater, Somerset, on 31 January 1928, to Ernest Clatworthy, a railway clerk, and Gladys, n√©e Jugaler; he went to Dr. Morgan's Grammar School in Bridgewater. He studied the violin as a boy and was uncertain whether to become an artist or a musician. In 1945‚Äì46 he studied at the West of England College of Art, and then did National Service. From 1947 to 1949 he was at the Chelsea School of Art in London, where he studied under Bernard Meadows, and then in 1950‚Äì51 went to the Slade School of Fine Art. He worked briefly as an assistant to Henry Moore; it was Moore who persuaded him to attend the Slade rather than the Royal College of Art. In the early 1950s Clatworthy was, with Anthony Caro, Elizabeth Frink and Eduardo Paolozzi, among the young sculptors brought in by Frank Martin to teach in the new sculpture department at Saint Martin's School of Art. In 1956 he joined The London Group. From 1960 until 1972 he taught at the Royal College of Art and, between 1967 and 1971, also at the West of England College of Art. He was a governor of Saint Martin's from 1970 to 1971, and then, until 1975, head of the fine art department at Central. He was elected a Royal Academician on 26 April 1973. Clatworthy was married twice: in 1954 to Pamela Gordon, the daughter of Gertrude Lawrence, with whom he had two sons and a daughter, and from whom he was divorced; and in 1989 to Jane Illingworth Stubbs. After the break-up of his first marriage in the 1970s he moved with his new wife to an isolated farmhouse at Cynghordy, near Llandovery, in southern Wales, where he spent his later life as a recluse. He died on 15 or 16 March 2015.  Work  Clatworthy is considered one of the informal Geometry of Fear group of sculptors, so named by Herbert Read in 1952. Many of Clatworthy's sculptures are bronzes of animals, often with heavilytextured surfaces. His first solo show was at the Hanover Gallery in 1954, and in 1959 his work was shown there with that of Arp, C√©sar, Giacometti, Matisse and Picasso. His work is in the collections of the Tate Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Arts Council of Great Britain. His portrait bust of Elizabeth Frink (1983) was bought by the National Portrait Gallery in 1984. Two of his works are installed as public art: a Bull commissioned by the London County Council in 1956‚Äì57 is now in the Alton Estate council housing estate in Roehampton, in south-west London; and Horseman and Eagle, commissioned in 1984‚Äì85 for a new office block at 1 Finsbury Avenue in the City, is now in the grounds of Charing Cross Hospital in Hammersmith. In about 1990 Clatworthy developed a skin infection which prevented him from working in plaster, and turned to painting, mostly figures and portraits of unidentified people. He returned to sculpture in 2002.  Reception  In the 1950s Clatworthy was among the best-known sculptors in Britain. The critic David Sylvester thought his work the best by any sculptor younger than Moore; Clatworthy and his LCC Bull appeared on the front page of the Sunday Times in 1957; the Tate Gallery bought the first of two of his bull sculptures in the same year. His reputation later faded.  References  Further reading * Keith Chapman (2012). Robert Clatworthy: Sculpture and Drawings. Bristol: Sansom & Co. .

Life  =Family and conflict with the Hamdanids= The Buyid amirates in ca. 970 Abu Ishaq was born on 21 September 953, his father was Mu'izz al-Dawla, while his mother was a daughter of the Dailamite officer Ispahdost. Abu Ishaq had four brothers named Bakhtiyar, Habashi, Marzuban, Abu Tahir, and a sister named Zubayda. Abu Ishaq, during his youth, was tutored in Baghdad. In 967, Mu'izz al-Dawla died and was succeeded by Bakhtiyar, who was then given the title of \\"'Izz al-Dawla\\". In ca. 972, Abu Ishaq was given the honorific title of \\"Umdat al-Dawla\\". In 973, while Izz al-Dawla and his Turkish general Sabuktakin were campaigning in the territories of the Hamdanid ruler Abu Taghlib, the latter outflanked the Buyid army and marched towards Baghdad. Abu Ishaq, along with his mother, the Abbasid Caliph al-Muti, including the women and children of the city, fortified themselves in a castle, waiting for Sabuktakin to return to Baghdad. The vizier of 'Izz al-Dawla, Ibn Baqiyya, shortly arrived to Baghdad and aided Abu Ishaq in strengthening the defenses of Baghdad. In the end a treaty was made, which resulted in the restoration of Mosul and its surrounding areas to the Hamdanids. =Rebellion of Sabuktakin= Some months later, 'Izz al-Dawla, who had financial difficulties, tried to solve them by seizing the Turkish fiefs, most of which were in Khuzestan. At the same time, he dismissed Sabuktakin from his post. These actions made most of the army become hostile to 'Izz al-Dawla, and while 'Izz al-Dawla was away from Baghdad, the army under Sabuktakin then wished to make Abu Ishaq to become the new Buyid ruler of Iraq. Abu Ishaq shortly received these news, and at first thought to join them, but after the urging from his mother, he declined the proposal. The army then shortly openly rebelled, and Abu Ishaq along with his mother and brother Abu Tahir, including their followers, then made an agreement with Sabuktakin to stop resistance in return for safety. The rebels shortly managed to capture Baghdad, and then marched towards Wasit, where 'Izz al-Dawla had forfitred himself. During the siege, Sabuktakin died, and was succeeded by Alptakin as the leader of the rebels. Fortunately for the family of 'Izz al-Dawla, his cousin, 'Adud al-Dawla, the ruler of Fars, who had been ordered by his father Rukn al-Dawla to aid 'Izz al-Dawla, arrived to Iraq, and in 974, along with 'Izz al-Dawla and Abu Ishaq, including other officers, advanced towards al- Mada'in, and by 975 the rebels were completely defeated. After order was made in Iraq, Abu Ishaq was given a robe of honor by Rukn al-Dawla. He was also appointed as the governor of Ahvaz by 'Izz al-Dawla. Map of Early Islamic Syria and its provinces =Invasion of 'Adud al-Dawla and the flight to Syria= In 976, after the death of Rukn al-Dawla, war shortly ensured between 'Izz al-Dawla and 'Adud al-Dawla. Abu Ishaq was then sent to 'Askar Mukram in Khuzistan to secure the front of Izz al-Dawla's kingdom. Meanwhile, 'Adud al- Dawla was advancing towards Ramhurmuz, where he routed the army of the city and captured it. After receiving the news of the fall of Ramhurmuz, 'Izz al- Dawla ordered Abu Ishaq to withdraw from 'Askar Mukram and return to Iraq. 'Adud al-Dawla then advanced towards Iraq, and routed another army, which made Abu Ishaq, his brother, and Ibn Baqiyya flee from the frontier. 'Adud al-Dawla eventually managed to capture Baghdad, and gave 'Izz al-Dawla and his brothers permission to settle in Syria. 'Izz al-Dawla, along with his son Marzuban ibn Bakhtiyar and his brothers Abu Ishaq and Abu Tahir, then went to Damascus, which had been captured by the rebel Alptakin and his followers. Alptakin warmly received the Buyid brothers and their followers, but then made them involved in his conflict with the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt. A battle shortly ensued at Ramla. However, during the battle, Marzuban betrayed Alptakin and abandoned the battlefield. The forces of Alptakin were shortly defeated, and Abu Tahir was killed, while Abu Ishaq was taken captive by the Fatimids. After this event, Abu Ishaq is no longer mentioned any source.

After the defeat of his father in 977 at the hands of his relative 'Adud al-Dawla, he, along with his father and uncles went to Damascus, where they were warmly received by its ruler, Alptakin, who, however, made them involved in his conflict with the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt. A battle shortly ensured at Ramla between the army of Alptakin and the Fatimids. However, during the battle, Marzuban betrayed Alptakin and abandoned the battlefield. The forces of Alptakin were shortly defeated, and Marzuban's uncle Abu Tahir was killed, while his other uncle Abu Ishaq Ibrahim was taken captive by the Fatimids.

He had served as a professor of Sanskrit at the Scottish Church College in Calcutta.Teaching Staff: Sanskrit in 175th Year Commemoration Volume. Scottish Church College, April 2008. page 573 He was a key figure in reviving many manuscripts of the PaippalƒÅda-Sa·πÉhitƒÅ and its ancillary literature like the ƒÄ·πÖgirasakalpa after painstaking search over years in Orissa and south-west Bengal. Durgamohan Bhattacharyya‚Äôs discovery of a living tradition of the PaippalƒÅda-Sa·πÉhitƒÅ, unknown until then, was hailed in the Indological world as epoch making. Ludwig Alsdorf went so far as to say that it was the greatest event in Indology. Bhattacharyya died in 1965 leaving his edition of the text incomplete. This task was completed by his son Dipak, whose critical edition of the first 18 kƒÅ·πá·∏ças was published by the Asiatic Society, Calcutta came out in three volumes in 1997, 2008 and 2011. Early life In the early 1900 he with other members of his family, migrated to Sahanagar, Lalbag in the district of Murshidabad. The family was poor and could not send its young children to an English medium school. His early education was derived from tols and chatuspathis, where the main subjects taught were Bengali and Sanskrit, the medium of education primarily being Bengali. Durgamohan was an exceptionally brilliant student and by the year 1915 he had appeared at several Sanskrit Upadhi examinations and topped the list of candidates for the several examinations on Sanskrit conducted by the Government of Bengal. He acquired the highest degrees in Kavya, Sankhya and Purana and got the title of Bhagavataratna. Durgamohan with his widowed mother (Sarada) and only younger brother moved to his maternal uncle's house in Calcutta. Coming to know about the keen desire of Durgamohan to study English, his senior maternal uncle took him to Suresh Chandra Kundu, then the headmaster of Town School, Calcutta, an institution of great reputation. It was an immense task for Durgamohan to achieve as he had already reached the age of 16 and he was required to complete the normal course of ten years in a single year. He successfully completed the task and in 1917 he sat for the Entrance Examination of the University of Calcutta and was declared successful, obtaining a place in the First Division of successful candidates. The Intermediate Examination (F.A.) was achieved in 1919 at the Vidyasagar College, the B.A. Examination with a First Class honours Degree in Sanskrit from the Scottish Church College was gained in 1921 and the master's degree in Sanskrit was obtained in 1923 from the University of Calcutta. Career =Early career= After completing his studies in the University, Durgamohan decided to take up the educational line as his field of activities. Having served as a Professor of Sanskrit in the Narasinha Dutt College of Howrah for some time, he joined the Scottish Church College as a professor of Sanskrit and Bengali and eventually became the head of the department of Sanskrit in the early thirties. In 1952 he was inducted in the West Bengal Senior Educational Service as Professor of Vedic Language, Literature and Culture in the Postgraduate Training and Research Department of the Sanskrit College, which position he occupied till the date of his death. He used to be invited by learned societies like the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Asiatic Society of Bombay, the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, and others to deliver talks on specific topics particularly the Vedas. He was awarded gold medals by the Asiatic Societies for his services in the field of Sanskrit. =Work on PaippalƒÅda-Sa·πÉhitƒÅ= He had come to infer from many sources that of the four Vedas, the Atharva Veda and its practice had not become extinct in India as many scholars of repute used to hold and propagate. To prove his conviction in this regard he visited a large number of places all over India, and, ultimately a few years before his death, he was able to locate a place in Orissa, Guhiapal to be precise where he found the Atharva Veda to be actively practiced and there he discovered several Oriya manuscripts in which the PaippalƒÅda-Sa·πÉhitƒÅ, one of the nine versions of the Atharva Veda was faithfully reproduced. The discovery was made known to the world and the belief about the extinction of the practice of Atharva Veda was proved incorrect. He was hailed for his painstaking effort and perseverance in the unearthing of the PaippalƒÅda-Sa·πÉhitƒÅ as an epoch making discovery. He started serious work on the PaippalƒÅda-Sa·πÉhitƒÅ, and publications also started which received acclamations from scholars all over the world. But unfortunately Durgamohan fell ill with cancer and died on 12 November 1965. His task was completed by his son Dipak Bhattacharya whose critical edition of the first 18 kƒÅ·πá·∏ças published by the Asiatic Society, Calcutta came out in three volumes in 1997, 2008 and 2011. (Input source Mrs Lila Chakraborty, Mr Joy Bhattacharya) Personal life Durgamohan had five sons and four daughters. His wife Bhavani Bhattacharya died in 1992.

From 1897 Franc√© studied biology for eight semesters and became a student under the Hungarian protozoa scientist (Protozoenforscher) Geza Entz. During this time he undertook fourteen botanical expeditions. In 1898 he was appointed Deputy Head of the Institute of Plant Protection of Agricultural Academy in Hungarian- Altenburg. Here he published his first natural philosophical work. Thereupon Franc√© received in 1902 the invitation to come to Munich. In 1906 he founded the \\"Deutsche Mikrologische Gesellschaft\\" (German micrological Company) and its institution over which he presided as director. He was editor of this company and co-founder of the journal Mikrokosmos (1907). He was editor of other periodicals, such as Jahrbuch f√ºr Mikroskopiker and Mikrologische Bibliothek. In 1906 Franc√© initiated the eight-volume monumental work \\"The Life of Plants\\", whose first four volumes (1906-1910) are from his own pen. The publishing company advertised this book as \\"Pflanzen-Brehm\\" (\\"Plant- Brehm\\", after the famous book \\"Brehms Tierleben\\"). In 1922, he published a popular version of the scientific evidence on the soil biota in a booklet \\"Das Leben im Ackerboden\\" (Life in the soil). Throughout his busy life he wrote 60 books and a variety of popular science articles and writings. In the \\"Walter Seifert Verlag\\" he was the editor of the journal \\"Telos - fortnightly magazine for work and success\\" (Telos ‚Äì Halbmonatsschrift f√ºr Arbeit und Erfolg). As a renowned graphic artist Franc√© developed the technique of \\"feather stitch\\" (Federstich), which is rooted in the copper engraving (Kupferstich). Stages of his life are Dinkelsb√ºhl, Wroclaw, Salzburg, Munich and Dubrovnik-Ragusa. In his life he wrote many books in which he anticipated many modern ecological ideas. Franc√© died of leukemia in 1943 in Budapest. He is buried together with his wife in Oberalm, Austria.  Legacy  Organic farming is based in part on the findings by Franc√©, which were published in his books \\"Das Edaphon\\" , 1913, and \\"Das Leben im Ackerboden\\", 1922, (Life in the soil) and a series of articles in the journal Mikrokosmos made available for a broad public. But this scientific source is usually concealed. His wife Annie Franc√©-Harrar Annie Franc√©-Harrar, a well-known biologist and author, worked many years with him and continued after his death in 1943 parts of his scientific work. Today Raoul H. Franc√© is rediscovered as the founder of \\"Biotechnik\\" (Now called \\"Bionics\\"). His books \\"Das Edaphon\\" and \\"Das Leben im Ackerboden\\" were again published as reprints since 1959.http://stiftung- france.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=44&t;=299 Many of his then and now progressive ideas only gained its assessment at the end of the 20th century. In Munich and Dinkelsb√ºhl a street bears his name.

The River Solent is a now-extinct river which during the Paleocene would have flowed around the area which is now the coastlines of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. History The River Solent was one of three major rivers in central and southern England, together with the Proto-Thames and Bytham, but unlike the other two it was not destroyed by the extreme Anglian Glaciation around 450,000 years ago. It became extinct after flooding following the end of the last ice age, becoming submerged and incorporated into the Solent, a strait of the English Channel that sits between the Isle of Wight and Hampshire. The River Solent's source was the River Frome, and the River Solent's tributaries, the River Test, River Itchen, the River Avon and the River Medina still survive today. Several towns on both the South Coast and the Isle of Wight are built near features of the River Solent - Cowes and East Cowes are built around the mouth of the River Medina, which formed due to the flooding of one of the shallow valleys formed by the River Solent. Geology The areas around the River Solent are, like most of Hampshire, made up of chalk and Tertiary (mostly Eocene) clays and sands with minor limestones.http://www.solentprotection.org/about-the-solent/what-is-the- solent/ References Category:Rivers of Hampshire Category:Rivers of the Isle of Wight Category:Former rivers ","title":"River Solent"},{"id":"43090371","title":"2014‚Äì15 Loyola Marymount Lions men's basketball team"},{"id":"43090374","text":"Abakar Adoum (born 18 August 1984) is a retired Chadian football player.

It is found in sheltered areas of reefs away from direct wave action to depths of . Biology Lobophyllia ishigakiensis is a zooxanthellate species of coral. It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the symbiotic dinoflagellates that live inside its soft tissues. These photosynthetic organisms provide the coral with organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes providing up to 90% of their host's energy needs for metabolism and growth. Its remaining needs are met by the planktonic organisms caught by the tentacles of the polyps. Status This coral has a wide range but is rare throughout its range. It is particularly susceptible to coral bleaching and to coral diseases.

() was the agricultural machinery division of the French car manufacturer Renault established in 1918 from its armored military vehicles division. While in operation, Renault Agriculture had various partnerships with major manufacturers and focussed production on tractors. The company was sold between 2003 and 2008 to German rival Claas. Renault Agriculture was dissolved in 2008 and its facilities became part of Claas' tractor division. Claas' tractor division and Renault's Auto Ch√¢ssis International are Renault Agriculture successors. History An Ar√®s, one of the last models of Renault Agriculture. After the end of World War I, the Renault company used its experience in armored tanks to devise agricultural vehicles. The Renault's Department 14 (responsible for the FT tank) developed the first tractor of the company, the Type GP, which was powered by an engine similar to that of the FT (a four-cylinder) and had tracks. The most distinguishable differences of the new tractor with the FT were the front- engine design and the reduced weight. The tractors were assembled in Renault's Billancourt factory since 11 November 1918 on the same production lines that the tanks and tested at Louis Renault's farm in Herqueville. The Type HO introduced in 1921 replaced the tracks by more conventional wheels. In 1926, Renault introduced the Type PE which was extensively revised compared to its predecessors, incorporating a new engine with reduced consumes and a vertical radiator. In 1931, with the PE1, the radiator was moved from the middle position used in the previous models to the front and, in 1933, the model became the first France-produced rubber-wheeled tractor. The company also started to develop versions for specific markets, as vineyards. With the aim of reducing the fuel costs, it introduced its first diesel-engined model, the Type VI, in 1932. By 1938, Renault was producing about 40 tractors per month and was the largest French manufacturer. In 1920, Renault founded the Le Mans engineering centre. Shortly after, plans to move the agricultural machinery production to the new site were revealed. However, the new factory was inaugurated in 1940 and the production was stopped because of World War II. Following the war and nationalisation, the Le Mans plant resumed production. The location was divided into a foundry section, a mechanical parts section (supplying the factories of Flins and Billancourt), a painting section and a tractor manufacturing section. At the time, Le Mans was the third largest Renault's operation in France after Billancourt and Cl√©on. The following years saw the arrival of the D, N, E and Super model series. In 1956, Renault Agriculture standardised the orange colour for its models. In 1950, Renault was the largest tractor manufacturer within France, producing 8,549 units, the 58% of the country's total production. In 1961, Renault introduced the 385 model, with a 12-gear transmission. Apart from its own engines, Renault used MWM and Perkins units. In the 1960s, it produced the One-Sixty Diesel for Allis-Chalmers. In 1968, the company introduced its first four-wheel drive model. In 1972, Renault partnered with Carraro and sold some models of that company with the Renault badge. During the 1970s and 1980s, it also sold models from Mitsubishi. At the 1981 SIMA exhibition Renault Agriculture unveiled the TX range, with comfort elements designed in collaboration with the Renault's car division. The last Renault tractors had ancient gods' names. From late 1993 to 1998, Renault Agriculture and John Deere had a partnership agreement by which the former received John Deere engines manufactured at the Saran factory and in return it supplied John Deere with tractors marketed as the 3000 series. In 1994, Renault Agriculture and Massey Ferguson formed a strategic partnership, as part of which they set up an equally owned joint venture called Groupement International de M√©canique Agricole (GIMA) at a facility located next to Massey's Beauvais factory with the aim of manufacturing transaxles and related components. In 1995, Renault Agriculture agreed to market products from the British agricultural machinery manufacturer JCB through its dealership network in France. In 1997, the company took a 16.6% stake of Rovigo-based Agritalia, a manufacturer of orchard tractors for various clients. In 2000, it purchased a stake in the Indian manufacturer International Tractors (the owner of the Sonalika marque), forming a Sonalika- Renault joint venture. In 2003, as part of a plan to shed non-core assets, Renault sold a 51% majority stake in Renault Agriculture's tractor manufacturing plant to Claas. In 2006, Claas increased its ownership to 80% and in 2008 took full control and renamed it Claas Tractor. By 2005, the Renault marque was phased out and all the tractor models produced at Le Mans were badged as Claas.

Career  J. Andrew Keith, and his brother William H. Keith Jr., had seen ads in Journal of the Travellers Aid Society that stated that Game Designers' Workshop (GDW) was seeking authors; Loren Wiseman brought them on to begin freelancing for GDW in 1978 or 1979, and together the three of them set up much of the early tone for the Traveller universe. J. Andrew Keith's writing for the Journal of the Travellers Aid Society was so extensive that he began to use the pseudonyms John Marshal and Keith Douglass. The Keith brothers were making enough money that they were able to freelance full-time starting around 1979. The Keith brothers began working for FASA by the end of 1980. FASA began getting into publishing adventures for Traveller beginning with Ordeal by Eshaar (1981) by the Keith brothers, who then wrote FASA's \\"Sky Raiders\\" trilogy (1981-1982). J. Andrew Keith briefly edited the magazine High Passage in 1982 before the High Passage Group told FASA that they could not publish additional High Passage material; FASA replaced this magazine with a new J. Andrew Keith magazine called Far Traveller, which began publication in October 1982. When FASA ended its support of Traveller, the Keith brothers moved their Traveller writing to a new company called Gamelords, but continued working for FASA in other capacities. The Keith brothers wrote seven supplements for Gamelords, including The Mountain Environment (1983), The Undersea Environment (1983), and The Desert Environment (1984). J. Andrew Keith wrote some adventures for Fantasy Games Unlimited's Chivalry & Sorcery before the line ended. The Keith brothers expanded into FGU's other lines in 1985 including Aftermath!, Daredevils, Flashing Blades, and Psi World. The Keith brothers also designed Freedom Fighters (1986), one of the last role- playing games published by FGU.  Works  Andrew was a rather prolific Science Fiction and Role-Playing Game author, and the bibliography presented below is in no way comprehensive.

Life Born on 7 October 1801, he was fourth son of William Hussey, rector of Sandhurst, near Hawkhurst in Kent. For a time at Rochester grammar school, in 1814 he was sent to Westminster School, in 1816 became a king's scholar, and in 1821 was elected to Christ Church, Oxford. There he resided for the remainder of his life. He obtained a double first-class in the B.A. examination, Michaelmas 1824, and proceeded M.A. in 1827 and B.D. in 1837. After a few years spent in private tuition, Hussey was appointed one of the college tutors, and held the post until he became censor in 1835. He was appointed select preacher before the university in 1831 and again in 1846. He was proctor in 1836, in which year he was an unsuccessful candidate for the head-mastership of Harrow School. In 1838 he was appointed one of the classical examiners at Oxford, and from 1841 to 1843 was one of the preachers at the Royal Chapel, Whitehall. In 1842 Hussey gave up his college duties on his appointment to the newly founded regius professorship of ecclesiastical history. the canonry of Christ Church later attached to the professorship was not then vacant, a salary was paid by the university. In 1845 Hussey was presented by the dean and chapter of Christ Church to the perpetual curacy of Binsey. He was subsequently appointed rural dean by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, and was elected one of the proctors in convocation for the diocese of Oxford. In 1854, when the new hebdomadal council was appointed, Hussey was chosen one of the professorial members. He died rather suddenly of heart disease on 2 December 1856. To the dean and chapter of Christ Church he bequeathed the ecclesiastical history and patristic theology works of his library, for the use of his successors in the chair. Works For the benefit of his students, Hussey edited the histories of Socrates of Constantinople (1844), Evagrius Scholasticus (1844), Bede (1846), and Sozomen (3 vols. finished after his death, 1860). In a volume of Sermons, mostly Academical (Oxford, 1849), he published a Preface containing a Refutation of the Theory founded upon the Syriac Fragments of three of the Epistles of St. Ignatius, then recently discovered and published by William Cureton. His conclusion, later generally adopted, was that these fragments of the Ignatian Epistles contain only certain extracts from the Epistles, and not the whole text. In 1851, at the time of Universalis Ecclesiae he published a manual on The Rise of the Papal Power traced in Three Lectures (reissued, with additions, in 1863). Hussey was opposed to the Oxford movement but was not partisan. He issued a pamphlet in February 1845 containing Reasons for Voting upon the Third Question to be proposed in Convocation on the 13th inst., in which he argued the unreasonableness of the proposal to condemn Tract 90 a second time, four years after its first appearance. He wrote also An Essay on the Ancient Weights and Money and the Roman and Greek Liquid Measures; with an Appendix on the Roman and Greek Foot, Oxford, 1836, based on examination of ancient coins. Family Hussey married Elizabeth Ley, sister of his friend and contemporary at Christ Church, the Rev. Jacob Ley. She survived him with one daughter. His eldest sister, Charlotte Sutherland, gave to the Bodleian Library in 1837 a large collection of historical prints and drawings.

The species in uncommon throughout its range, and is threatened by the global loss of coral reef habitats. Description Colonies of Acanthastrea rotundoflora are either massive or encrusting. The corallites are plocoid and rather widely separated, and in small colonies there is a conspicuous central corallite. The septa have long pointed teeth. The general colour of this coral is rusty-brown, dark brown or green. Biology Acanthastrea rotundoflora is a zooxanthellate species of coral. It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the symbiotic dinoflagellates that live inside its soft tissues. These photosynthetic organisms provide the coral with organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes providing up to 90% of their host's energy needs for metabolism and growth. Its remaining needs are met by the planktonic organisms caught by the tentacles of the polyps. Status This coral has a wide range and is moderately common. It is less susceptible to coral bleaching than some related species because it occurs in deeper water. The population trend for this species is unclear, but the main threats faced by corals in general are related to climate change and the mechanical destruction of their coral reef habitats; increasing damage from extreme weather events, rising sea water temperatures and ocean acidification. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this species as being a \\"near-threatened species\\". All corals receive protection by being listed on CITES Appendix II.

Background =The federal treaty power= As part of the British North America Act, 1867, the Parliament of Canada was granted power to implement certain treaties: During the 1920s, as a result of the growing political and diplomatic independence of the various Dominions of the Empire, the Balfour Declaration of 1926 stated that the United Kingdom and the Dominions were: When Canada subsequently gained full independence following passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931, s. 132 was not amended to reflect its changed status. =The Labour Conventions= As a consequence of the Treaty of Versailles, the International Labour Organization was established, in which Canada became a member. Between 1919 and 1928, the ILO adopted several conventions, including: :* the Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919, :* the Weekly Rest (Industry) Convention, 1921, and :* the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention, 1928. Their ratification and implementation were not carried out, following a 1925 reference to the Supreme Court of Canada which declared that only the provincial legislatures had the competence to do so with the first two conventions, except with respect to federal civil servants and workers in those parts of Canada not within the limits of a province. The decision in that ruling was unanimous. In 1935, the Parliament of Canada ratified the conventions, and subsequently passed: :* The Weekly Rest In Industrial Undertakings Act,S.C. 1935, c. 14 :* The Minimum Wages Act,S.C. 1935, c. 44 and :* The Limitation of Hours of Work Act.S.C. 1935, c. 63 This change in position followed the Privy Council's decision in the Aeronautics Reference, which declared: As there was debate as to whether the Parliament had the competence to pass these Acts, reference questions were given to the Supreme Court as to in what particular or to what extent each of them was ultra vires. Reference to the Supreme Court of Canada The Court was evenly divided, 3-3, on each of the questions. Duff CJ, holding that all Acts were intra vires, as the conventions arose from the Treaty of Versailles, said: In his dissent, Rinfret J (as he then was) argued that the conventions were separate and did not arise as a consequence of the Treaty, the 1925 Reference was binding, and moreover that they were not properly ratified at all, declaring: Appeal to the Privy Council The Board held that all Acts were ultra vires. In his ruling, Lord Atkin held: :* \\"The obligations [arising from the conventions] are not obligations of Canada as part of the British Empire, but of Canada, by virtue of her new status as an international person, and do not arise under a treaty between the British Empire and foreign countries.\\" :* \\"No obligation to legislate in respect of any of the matters in question arose until the Canadian executive, left with an unfettered discretion of its own volition, acceded to the conventions, a novus actus not determined by the [Treaty of Versailles].\\" :* \\"For the purposes of sections 91 and 92 [of the BNA Act] ... there is no such thing as treaty legislation as such.\\" :* \\"The question is not how the obligation is formed, that is the function of the executive: but how is the obligation to be performed and that depends upon the authority of the competent legislature or legislatures.\\" Even though the Statute of Westminster 1931 had made Canada fully independent in governing its foreign affairs, the Board held that s. 132 did not accordingly evolve to take that into account. As noted at the end of the judgment, Aftermath =Labour relations= The scope of the federal jurisdiction with respect to labour relations, as determined by the 1925 reference, continued to apply until 1955, when the Stevedores Reference held that it extended to all works and undertakings falling under it. In that judgment, Abbott J declared: =Federalism= The Reference served to promote the concept of dual federalism, where the provinces could act as separate communities within a wider political union. As a result, spillover effects by an Act passed by one level of government onto the other level are not tolerated, and are dealt with by the courts through declaring the measure to be ultra vires, or \\"read down\\" so that it remains within the jurisdiction of the originating legislature. As to its general effect on federal and provincial jurisdiction, it has been suggested that the \\"watertight compartments\\" doctrine, generally construed as stating that nothing can be added or taken away, may be more properly described as meaning that a head of power can encompass more than it did at the beginning of Canadian Confederation in 1867, but it should not encompass less. The Supreme Court in 2011 summarized its present approach in Reference re Securities Act: =External relations= The Reference expressly left undecided the question as to the extent of the federal power to negotiate, sign and ratify treaties that deal with areas falling within provincial jurisdiction. After 1949, the Supreme Court tended to side more with the federal government, and in 1955 subsequently ruled that international agreements between provinces and foreign governments were allowed only if they did not involve treaty obligations but merely reciprocal or concurrent legislative action. This judgment has generated extensive debate about the complications that were introduced in implementing Canada's subsequent international obligations, and it has been condemned for being out of touch with Canadian economic and political realities. The Supreme Court of Canada has indicated in several dicta that it may be ready to revisit the issue in an appropriate case.Canadian Interpretation and Construction of Maritime Conventions , at note 25 An indication that that may eventually happen came in a comment by Dickson CJ in 1987: Further reading  * Notes References Category:Canadian federalism case law Category:Judicial Committee of the Privy Council cases on appeal from Canada Category:1937 in Canadian case law Category:Canadian labour case law Category:Canadian constitutional case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases ","title":"Labour Conventions Reference"},{"id":"43090690","text":"Kenje Ogata (June 1, 1919 ‚Äì January 18, 2012) was one of five documented Nisei to serve in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II.

Club career Born in Mairinque, in the S√£o Paulo state, C√©sar started competing in hometown club Atl√©tico Sorocaba in the Campeonato Paulista, where his performances sparked the interest of Ponte Preta which signed him on a loan deal on 26 April 2013. At Ponte Preta, C√©sar assumed a starting position, helping the team reach the 2013 Copa Sudamericana Finals, lost to Lan√∫s, moving permanently to Macaca side in December 2014. As the Brazilian team sought to benefit financially from recent performances, on 2 July 2014, they announced that C√©sar had signed a five-year deal with incumbent Portuguese champions Benfica for an undisclosed fee, later confirmed to be ‚Ç¨2.2M for half of his economic rights. On 14 December 2014, he debuted in the Primeira Liga, in a Benfica 0‚Äì2 away win at Porto, replacing injured Luis√£o. In late January 2015, he suffered a muscular injury, missing several months, only reappearing on 2 May 2015, when he played for reserve side in a 1‚Äì0 home win against Braga B in Segunda Liga. On 18 July 2015, C√©sar was loaned to Flamengo, until 30 June 2016. Despite being regularly used, his spell was not without controversy. In May 2016, he was approached by Flamengo fans outside a shopping market, who verbally insulted him and threw rocks at his car, with his wife and child inside. Two weeks later, in a match with Palmeiras, he stopped a Gabriel Jesus's goalbound shot with his hands, committing a professional foul, which carried a potential nine match ban. Flamengo asked Benfica to retain him for another year, but they declined. Upon returning to Portugal, he was loaned to Nacional for one-year. He played 30 games there, not avoiding relegation as the club finished last in Primeira Liga. Nacional's President attacked him saying he was the worst centre-back he had ever saw. C√©sar defended himself saying he always gave it all for the club and it was coward to name a culprit. In July 2017, he went on his third loan at Benfica, now to Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal. Mid-season, C√©sar requested to return to Brazil and signed with Juventude from S√©rie B. Eight months later, he terminated his contract with Benfica and joined Santa Clara on a two-year deal.

Receiving his elementary education there, he qualified as a surgeon at Glasgow University, and for a time, about the end of the 18th century, practised his profession in Ireland. Somewhat later he acted as captain in the North Lowland Regiment of fencibles, and settled in Glasgow. On 10 January 1803 Hunter became proprietor of the Glasgow Herald and Advertiser, to which he then for 34 years spent most of his time running. Soon afterwards, in a French invasion scare, he figured first as major in a corps of gentlemen sharpshooters, and secondly as colonel commandant of the fourth regiment of Highland local militia. Sitting on Glasgow town council, Hunter also rose to be a magistrate. In 1820 fresh military activity brought him forward as commander of a choice corps of gentlemen sharpshooters. From this time till 1837, when he retired from the Herald‚Äîthen a sheet of four pages, appearing bi-weekly‚Äîhe was one of the most prominent Glasgow citizens. After retiring Hunter settled at Rothesay, and he died on 9 June 1839 when visiting his nephew, Archibald Blair Campbell, D.D., parish minister of Kilwinning, Ayrshire.

Born in the city of Montreux, Switzerland of Italian origin, Emmanuel retains right to work status in both the United States and European Union. Beginning in 2010 he was awarded the position of principal conductor of the internationally acclaimed concert series Video Games Live, and is also known for his compositions on the multi-award-winning score of the video game Advent Rising. Early life Playing piano at the age of six, Emmanuel began his classical music studies upon acceptance to the Montreux Conservatory, in his hometown. As a teen, he discovered the jazz of Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock and began performing publicly at age 14. By his late teens, Emmanuel‚Äôs jazz quartet was to debut on the outer stages of the famed Montreux Jazz Festival. Emmanuel studied with eminent jazz educators Dick Grove, Lou Levy, Thierry Lang and pursued conducting studies in Los Angeles with Jack Feierman. Emmanuel‚Äôs prolific jazz composing was recognized when he was awarded Montreux‚Äôs most prestigious commission, at the age of 28. His concerto grosso September Suite, premiered at the Stravinsky Auditorium. The live recording marked the beginning of Emmanuel¬πs recording career. Film music Emmanuel began pursuing collaborative work with visual and movement artists in Europe, when he was awarded a visiting artist visa by the United States in 2000. He continued his training at UCLA in post graduate studies and privately with critically acclaimed, multi-Emmy winning television composers Alf Clausen (The Simpsons), and Jay Chattaway (Star Trek). He began working at the Paramount Music Library in 2003 as part of the score preparation team.

The House of Santcliment was an aristocratic and noble Spanish Catalan House established by Tom√†s de Santcliment, lord of Mequinenza between 1230 and 1244. He was granted authority by James I of Aragon over the castles of Cinca, Malda, and Maldanell as a reward for his participation in the conquest of Valencia. He bought the castle of Alcarr√°s from Guillem de Cardona in 1249.  History  =Branch of Lleida= In the fourteenth century, the members of this branch resided on Carrer Major of Lleida and lorded over territories that include Alcarr√†s, Montagut, Sarroca de Lleida, Llardecans, and Vilanova de Remolins. The house also owned large estates in Flix and La Palma d'Ebre (the last two were sold to Barcelona in 1398). Francesc de Santcliment, was one of the notable figures in the Lleida branch of the House of Santcliment. He served under Peter IV of Aragon, who sent him as ambassador to Avignon in 1336 and as a defender of the Aran Valley against the bishop of Comminges. Francesc founded the family chapel in the cathedral of Lleida. One of his children, Pere, was chancellor of the University of Lleida (1387-1403), canon, and then bishop of Lleida. His other son Francesc was paer in 1380 and veguer in 1413. The son of Francesc, Bernat de Santcliment, carried out a long lawsuit against the chapter of Lleida due to a dispute over a property near Montagut, which he lost. He also fought in the war against John II of Aragon in 1467 and was paer. By the sixteenth century, this branch was already in decline after losing Alcarr√°s, Sarroca, and Llardecans. =Branch of Barcelona= Pere de Santcliment was the first prominent member of the Santcliment branch in Barcelona. He was mentioned by James I of Aragon as \\"our scribe.\\" The members of this branch continued to serve as notari major of the chancery under Peter III of Aragon. The court positions held by the House helped this Barcelona branch amass fortune. The Santcliments continued to invest in the purchase of lands in addition to their small lordship near the Catalan capital in order to ensure their relevance to the group of distinguished citizens. The Barcelona branch of the Santcliment had a rich heritage and their legacy can be traced in their properties in and around Barcelona and these include: the torre de Bell-lloc in Sant Andreu de Palomar, consisting of mills and farms; the Torre Vella in Badalona and the casa de la Murtra near Santa Coloma. In addition, the Santcliment was granted land holdings after the conquest of Sardinia and a member of this house was part of Spain's campaign to control the island.

Farwell & Co. was a department store in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The store's history traces back to 1836, when the Wadsworth brothers came to Chicago to sell goods. E. S. Wadsworth eventually formed a partnership with Thomas Dyer and John Putnam Chapin as Wadsworth, Dyer & Chapin. Following a series of ownership changes, the company fell under the executive control of John Villiers Farwell, for whom the company was renamed. A profitable clothing store, Philip Wadsworth & Co., was later spun off from the company. John V. Farwell & Co. was the most successful store in the city until the 1871 Great Chicago Fire. The store continued to operate after the fire, but faced stiff competition from former partners Marshall Field and Levi Leiter. It was purchased by Carson, Pirie & Co. in 1926. History In 1836, E. S. Wadsworth came to Chicago, Illinois from New England to make land purchases and sell goods. His brother Julius soon followed. They soon formed a partnership with Thomas Dyer and opened a shop on Lake Street in a building owned by F. C. Sherman. The partnership later built their own store on South Water, between Clark and LaSalle Streets. The Wadsworths and Dyer then built a warehouse across the street from this second store to hold and sell grain. They also built a meatpacking house south of the Twelfth Street Bridge. As an investment, the Wadsworths built a store on the corner of Lake and Wabash Avenue. In 1843, Julius Wadsworth left the company due to poor health. In his place, John Putnam Chapin joined the operation, which became known as Wadsworth, Dyer & Chapin. They built a new slaughterhouse on the South Branch of the Chicago River and arranged a deal to slaughter cattle raised by Jesse and Isaac Funk. Wadsworth focused on retail operations while Dyer and Chapin concentrated on the meatpacking interests. In 1846, Chapin was elected the 10th Mayor of Chicago. Wadsworth moved the company to a retail focus while Dyer left to start his own meatpacking operation. Before the firm split, Wadsworth, Dyer & Chapin became one of the thirteen entities to support the creation of the Chicago Board of Trade; Dyer was named its first president. Longtime senior partner John Villiers Farwell William Henry Phelps was admitted as partner and the firm became Wadsworth & Phelps. Shortly thereafter, they accepted a Mr. Cooley as a senior partner, becoming Cooley, Wadsworth & Phelps. Phelps left the company in 1850 and was replaced by John Villiers Farwell; the store was restyled Cooley, Wadsworth & Co. Wadsworth retired in 1863. In 1864, the company was restyled Farwell, Field & Co. after Marshall Field and Levi Leiter were admitted to the partnership. However, the next year, Field and Leiter left to join Potter Palmer in Field, Palmer, Leiter & Co. (later Marshall Field & Co.) The store continued as John V. Farwell & Co. with a partnership consisting of Farwell, Charles B. Farwell, William D. Farwell, John K. Harmon, and S. N. Kellogg. Kellogg retired in 1867 and Simeon Farwell was admitted as a partner in 1870. John V. Farwell & Co. operated out of a building at 112-116 Wabash Avenue. Clothing operations were spun off into their own firm, first Huntington, Wadsworth & Parks and later the boot and shoe company C. M. Henderson & Co. In October 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the building and much of the surrounding area. A new building was then commissioned at the northwest corner of Monroe and Franklin Streets. In 1883, a new eight-story building at the corner of Market and Monroe Streets opened from the shop. Farwell left in the mid-1880s to invest in lands in Texas, namely the XIT Ranch. The company was sold to Carson, Pirie & Co. in 1926.

The abbey was built in the 12th century. After the Reformation, its lands were confiscated by the Crown and subsequently turned into a crown estate. Apart from the ruined church, the estate includes a manor house built in 1733 for the crown estate, known in Swedish as Roma kungsg√•rd. The manorial cultural landscape with avenues and large fields surrounding the ruined church and the manor is unique on Gotland. History The ruined abbey church, the west fa√ßade Roma Abbey is located in an area with old cultural traditions. The thing for all of Gotland was located on this strategical location on the middle of the islands, possibly as early as the Viking Age. Usually during the Middle Ages, abbeys like Roma were founded on land donated by the land-owning aristocracy, and the absence of any such group on Gotland may explain the location of the abbey. The land around the thing was common property and could therefore be used for founding an abbey. The abbey was founded in 1164 by Cistercian monks from Nydala Abbey in Sm√•land on mainland Sweden. Its name in Latin was Sancta Maria de Gutnalia. Eventually the abbey grew in importance and acquired large landholdings both on Gotland and in the present-day Baltic states. The abbey had particularly large holdings on Saaremaa island and in present-day mainland Estonia. During the Reformation, the abbey was disbanded and its lands on Gotland confiscated by the Danish Crown circa 1531 (as Gotland at the time belonged to Denmark). The abbey was converted into the seat of the Danish governor, and the buildings that no longer served any direct purpose were left to decay. After the Peace of Br√∂msebro in 1645, when Gotland became Swedish, it became the property of the Swedish Crown. In practice, the change of ownership meant few tangible changes for the estate. Towards the end of the 17th century, the Swedish Crown had put the land out for rent as a leasehold estate. In 1728 it befell the governor of Gotland, Johan Didrik Gr√∂nhagen. He constructed the manor house, partially using building material from the abbey. During World War II, a military airfield was established nearby and the manor house and its annexes were used by the military up until the 1990s. During this time the abbey suffered further neglect and damage. Today the abbey and the manor are owned by the National Property Board of Sweden. During summer theatre plays are staged among the ruins, a tradition that was initiated in 1989 and today attracts as many as 25,000 visitors every year, according to the organisers. Architecture Medieval portal incorporated in the manor =Manor= The manor house, unique in its kind on Gotland, was modelled after the manors of the aristocracy on the mainland. Building material was taken from the ruined abbey, and a few medieval portals were incorporated in the new building. =Abbey= Although the abbey church has been ruined and neglected for several centuries, it can still be appreciated as a typical representative of Cistercian architecture. The carefully proportioned church belongs to a type of church which is today best represented by the Abbey of Fontenay in France. The church was a basilica with a single nave flanked by two aisles. It was divided by a transept and instead of an apse had a straight east wall. In each of the transept arms there were two chapels. The church is characterised by a neat treatment of materials and a sobriety in the choice of decorations.

All mortgages are potentially assumable, though lenders may attempt to prevent assumption of a mortgage loan with a due-on-sale clause. Certain mortgage types are irrefutably assumable, such as those insured by the FHA, guaranteed by the VA, or guaranteed by the USDA. As of 2014, FHA and VA assumable mortgages make up approximately 18%, or one out of every six, mortgages in the United States.  Generally The assumption of a mortgage by the purchaser is typically included as part of the deed, although there is no requirement that it has to be in writing. In most jurisdictions, an explicit assumption is required. If a deed is silent or ambiguous on the matter, the court will assume the purchaser did not intend to assume the mortgage. However, some allow the assumption to be implied based on the behavior of the parties. For example, making payments on the mortgage can evince an intent to assume it, as can paying less than the value of the property (if the difference is the amount outstanding on the mortgage). Absent an assumption of the mortgage by the purchaser, he or she buys the property subject to the mortgage, which means the property is still encumbered and the lender has an interest in the property.  Example  For example, a homeowner owes a 30-year mortgage loan of $250,000 against his house. A prospective buyer wants to purchase the house for $300,000 and keep the same mortgage in order to avoid going through the process and expense of applying for a new loan. The buyer pays $50,000 cash for the equity and assumes the $250,000 mortgage, becoming liable for the debt.  Common Assumable Mortgages  #FHA Insured Loans ‚Äì All mortgages executed after December 1, 1986 require that the buyer be creditworthy to assume a seller‚Äôs mortgage. #VA Loans - All mortgages executed after March 1, 1988 require that the buyer be creditworthy to assume a seller‚Äôs mortgage. If a VA Loan is being assumed by a veteran with a home loan eligibility, the seller may also request to have their eligibility be re-instated upon completion of the assumption. #USDA Loans ‚Äì All USDA 502 mortgages are assumable by a creditworthy buyer, but as a new rate and terms assumption. #Adjustable-rate mortgages ‚Äì commonly are assumable, though not all.  Consent of Lender  In order to assume an existing mortgage loan it is generally necessary to obtain consent from the lender prior to the assumption process. Transfer of property with an existing mortgage loan that is made without the lender's consent is sometimes referred to as a sale \\"subject to\\" the existing loan. In most cases, this type of transfer does not avoid the lender's right to call the loan due under the due-on-sale provision in the loan. = Exceptions = #VA Loans dated prior to March 1, 1988 can be transferred without the approval of the lender, and the seller may still be released from liability on the mortgage loan. #FHA insured loans originated before December 1, 1986 generally contain no restrictions on assumability. Due to the HUD Reform Act of 1989 FHA mortgages executed between 1986 and 1989 are freely assumable, despite any restrictions stated in the mortgage.  Release of Liability  Upon completion of the assumption, the seller requests a release of liability from the lender. If the mortgage is assumed without the lender‚Äôs consent, the seller would remain liable for any default on the part of the buyer. In cases of a VA Loan, a release of liability may be obtained after the assumption even if the lender‚Äôs approval was not given prior to the completion of the assumption process.  Restriction on Assumption  In the United States, mortgage assumption of most types of mortgages is restricted by including a due-on-sale clause. This type of provision permits the lender to require payment of the full loan balance if the property is transferred to a new owner without the lender's consent. However, all FHA insured loans and VA loans (dated after March 1, 1988) are assumable as long as the buyer is creditworthy because they intentionally lack due on sale clauses.

The term first arose during the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, a period from late February to March 2014, when such forces occupied and blockaded the Simferopol International Airport, most military bases in Crimea, and the parliament in Simferopol. They also became known as \\"polite people\\" () as they were often perceived by local population to behave in a highly professional manner, despite being at the time a self-described \\"self-defense\\" force. The Russian Federation initially denied that these were Russian military forces, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin on 17 April 2014 finally confirmed the presence of the Russian military. Furthermore, numerous sources, including Russian state media, have confirmed that the \\"little green men\\" were a mix of operatives from the Special Operations Forces and various other Spetsnaz GRU units. Also, it was very likely the paratroopers of the 45th Guards Spetznaz Brigade of the VDV made up a portion of it as well. Weapons and equipment analysis In March 2014, the Finnish magazine Suomen Sotilas (Soldier of Finland) published an analysis of the weapons and equipment seen on photos of \\"little green men\\". The article points to a number of weapons and pieces of equipment that it asserts are issued only to armed forces in the Russian Federation: * New EMR camouflage combat uniforms * New 6Sh112 or 6Sh117 tactical vest * New , 6B7-1M composite helmet * New 7.62 mm PKP machine guns * 6B26 composite helmets (used only by airborne troops of the Russian Federation) * 6Sh92-5 tactical vest (used only by airborne troops of the Russian Federation) * Gorka-3 combat uniform (used only by Russian special forces and mountain troops) * Smersh AK/VOG tactical vest (used only by Russian special forces) The article goes on to conclude that with a very high probability \\"these troops are the 45th Guards Separate Reconnaissance Regiment of the VDV\\" based in Kubinka, Moscow. Other media has published a photo of an unmarked Russian soldier armed with a VSS Vintorez taken as proof of deployment of Russian special forces. Official Russian reaction Initially, President of Russia Vladimir Putin stated that the men in green were not part of the Russian Armed Forces, but groups of local militia who had seized their weapons from the Ukrainian Army. The SACEUR of NATO Allied Command Operations General Philip Breedlove said that these \\"green men\\" were in fact Russian troops. In March 2014, Putin continued to maintain that there was no pre-planned intervention, but that \\"the heavily armed, tightly coordinated groups who took over Crimea's airports and ports at the start of the incursion ‚Äì they were merely spontaneous 'self-defence groups' who may have acquired their Russian-looking uniforms from local [military] shops (voyentorg)\\". According to the Ukrainian Association of Gun Owners, Ukrainian law does not allow the selling or carrying of firearms other than for hunting. On 17 April 2014, President Putin admitted publicly for the first time that Russian special forces were involved in the events of Crimea, for the purposes of protecting local people and creating conditions for a referendum. Later, he admitted that the Russian Armed Forces had blocked the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Crimea during the events. In answer to the question of the presence of Russian troops in Crimea, Russian Minister of Defence Sergey Shoygu said, \\"Regarding the statements about use of Russian special forces in Ukrainian events, I can only say one thing ‚Äì it's hard to search for a black cat in a dark room, especially if it's not there,\\" and added cryptically that searching for the cat would be \\"stupid\\" if the cat is \\"intelligent, brave, and polite\\". In April 2015, retired Russian Admiral said that the \\"little green men\\" were members of Russian Spetsnaz special forces units. According to his information, Russian troop deployment in Crimea included six helicopter landings and three landings of Ilyushin Il-76 with 500 troops. In popular culture Opening ceremony of the monument of the \\"Polite People\\", 11 June 2016 * On 6 May 2015, a monument to \\"polite people\\" was erected in the city of Belogorsk, Amur Oblast, on the central square. It is made by the sculptor Konstantin Gilev in the form of a full-size figure of a Russian military man with a kitten in his arms. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu also supported the idea of installing a similar monument in Moscow. * Since February 2016, in the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, a children's magazine named \\"Polite little men\\" was published. * On 11 June 2016, a special was opened in the city of Simferopol. The ceremony was attended by Head of the Republic of Crimea Sergey Aksyonov, presidential envoy of the Crimean Federal District Oleg Belaventsev, a company of the guard of honor of the Black Sea Fleet, the Crimean militia, a unit of one of the military units, as well as hundreds of Crimeans and guests of the capital. The composition consisted of a soldier in full ammunition, a girl with flowers and a cat rubbing at his feet. The author of the sculpture is , who is an Academic of the Russian Academy of Arts and an honoured People's Artist of Russia.

After spending two years in the office of a Dublin merchant, he obtained a cadetship on the East India Company's establishment at Bengal, and went to India in 1776. He gained his first commission on 24 October that year, and was promoted lieutenant on 10 July 1778. Hamilton studied oriental languages, and became one of the first members of the Asiatic Society of Calcutta. He returned to England for his major work of translation, completed and published in 1791. He was appointed resident at the court of the grand vizier at Oudh, and prepared to leave England. Symptoms of consumption, however, appeared, and he was recommended to take a voyage to Lisbon; but he died at Hampstead on 14 March 1792, aged 39, and was buried in Bunhill Fields. A monument to his memory was later erected in Belfast by his sisters, who included Elizabeth Hamilton. Works While engaged in an expedition against the Rohillas he collected the materials Historical Relation of the Origin, Progress, and Final Dissolution of the Government of the Rohilla Afgans in the Northern Provinces of Hindostan, 1787, compiled from a Persian manuscript and other original papers. In 1786 he obtained permission to return home for five years in order to translate from Persian the Al-Hidayah, published as the Hedaya, or Guide, a work of fiqh; he was selected for the task by the governor-general and council of Bengal.

History  The Kendall power plant was built in 1949, operating in \\"relative obscurity\\" for some time as it was only turned on when high energy levels were demanded. In 2003, the power plant switched to natural gas from oil and became more active. In 2004, there were complaints from environmentalists that water intake and water discharge was damaging marine life. A 2006 permit issued by federal and state environmental officials was appealed by power plant officials on the grounds of being too strict. The plan for the GenOn Kendall Cogeneration Station to slice its hot water discharge was revealed in February 2011. It had been negotiated along with the Environmental Protection Agency New England office and state regulators. The plan called for converting hot water to steam to be sent to Boston, possibly by a pipe. The agreement ended \\"a six-year battle between the plant‚Äôs operators and environmentalists over its state and federal water discharge permits.\\" Veolia Energy North America was working on the pipe, to be completed by 2016. As such, waste heat from the Kendall Cogeneration Stataion in Cambridge would heat buildings in Boston. The pipeline extension was completed in 2013. In January 2012, the station had a production capacity of 256 megawatts, and in 2010 produced roughly 717,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. While it used natural gas primarily, it also had oil as a backup to produce both electricity and steam energy. In 2012, the plant was owned by GenOn Energy. In 2013 Veolia Energy North America purchased the plant for NRG Energy.

For a typical consumer loan such as a home mortgage or automobile loan, the original unpaid principal balance is the amount borrowed, and therefore the amount the borrower owes the lender on the origination date of the loan. The unpaid principal balance will decrease as time goes on for the loans that are structured with level payments. For these common loans, each monthly payment includes both interest and principal. The unpaid principal balance at the beginning of a given month is reduced by that portion of the level payment that is designated principal for that month; so that the unpaid principal balance at the end of the month is the beginning UPB less the principal paid for the month. Hence, the UPB decreases over time.  Example  Showing how UPB decreases each month A $100,000 loan with an original UPB with a nominal 6% annual rate loan. The monthly interest rate is therefore .5% (6% divided by 12 months). The level monthly payment for a 30-year mortgage loan is $599.55. The UPB at the end of first month is calculated as follows: Principal paid in first payment of $599.55 #The first month interest of .5% of $100,000.00 yields $500.00 #$599.55 monthly payment less $500.00 interest yields $99.55 as the principal amount in the first monthly payment #$100,000.00 original UPB less $99.55 yields the UPB at the end of the first month (beginning of second month) of $99,900.45 #This process is repeated for each subsequent month to calculate the UPB on a monthly basis.

Andrea Lomuscio usually performs using a custom-built purple piano, the Arcadetar, and a pedalboard to trigger chords; being able to play a bass part, a chord pattern, a lead instrument and a vocal part contemporaneously. No pre-recorded sequences are used during live performances. An interview about the creative process behind the construction of the Arcadetar Musical style Teapot Industries' sound has been described as a combination of various genres, including a psychedelic version of Jeff Buckley, the prog of Genesis and King Crimson, Pink Floyd, the ballads of Deep Purple, Empire of the Sun's synthpop, and Muse. The main peculiarity is the absence of a verse-chorus structure, with frequent key and tempo changes in the same song. This characteristic is directly taken from the 70's prog-rock, as mentioned before, but Teapot Industries go further corrupting the prog-rock sound with alternative and electronic ones, and always keeping the songs very short. It's not just a chance that Relligion Town contains many musical references, it is a pastiche and a programmatic piece that introduces the listener to Teapot Industries' music.Atom Heart Magazine, 10 May 2012 =Lyrics= The Teapot Industries Corporation is obviously a reference to the authority and dominance of religions.

The Falcon 9 first-stage landing tests were a series of controlled-descent flight tests conducted by SpaceX between 2013 and 2016. Since 2017, the first stage of Falcon 9 missions has been routinely landed if the rocket performance allowed it, and if SpaceX chose to recover the stage. The program's objective was to reliably execute controlled re-entry, descent and landing (EDL) of the Falcon 9 first stage into Earth's atmosphere after the stage completes the boost phase of an orbital spaceflight. The first tests aimed to touch down vertically in the ocean at zero velocity. Later tests attempted to land the rocket precisely on an autonomous spaceport drone ship (a barge commissioned by SpaceX to provide a stable landing surface at sea) or at Landing Zone 1 (LZ-1), a concrete pad at Cape Canaveral. The first ground landing at LZ-1 succeeded in December 2015, and the first landing at sea on a drone ship in April 2016. The second landed booster, B1021, was the first to fly again in March 2017, and was recovered a second time.  Landings of Falcon 9 first-stage boosters   Overview  The first landing test occurred in September 2013 on the sixth flight of a Falcon 9 and maiden launch of the v1.1 rocket version. From 2013 to 2016, sixteen test flights were conducted, six of which achieved a soft landing and recovery of the booster: * flight 20 (Orbcomm OG2 M2) safely touching down on the LZ-1 ground pad upon first attempt in December 2015; * flight 23 (CRS-8) finally achieving a stable landing at sea in the Atlantic on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You in April 2016 after four previous attempts ended in destruction of the booster upon impact; * flights 24 (JCSAT-14) and 25 (Thaicom 8) returning at higher speed from GTO missions at sea on a drone ship in May 2016; * flight 27 (CRS-9) returning to LZ-1 in July 2016; * flight 28 (JCSAT-16) landing on a drone ship in August 2016; Since the January 2017 return to flight, SpaceX has stopped referring to landing attempts as \\"experimental\\", indicating that they have become a routine procedure (see Iridium-1 and CRS-10 press kits of 2017, compared with CRS-9 and JCSAT-16 of 2016). , 14 routine landings have been performed ( success) and three missions were launched in expendable configuration, not attempting to land. The first-stage descent tests were part of the larger SpaceX reusable launch system development program, which included a large amount of new technology development activities and earlier low-altitude test flights at the SpaceX facility in McGregor, Texas in preparation for the high-altitude high- velocity testing of landing test phase of the program. The overall objective of the program is to privately develop reusable rockets using vertical-landing technology so as to substantially reduce the cost of space access. Traditionally, the first stages of orbital carrier rockets have been discarded in the ocean once the ascent was complete. Achieving routine recovery and reuse of the launch vehicles could dramatically reduce the cost of access to space.  History  From the beginning, Elon Musk wanted the first stage of SpaceX launch vehicles to be recoverable, and all Falcon 1 launches and the first two Falcon 9 launches had parachutes. However the boosters burned up on reentry, before the parachutes even deployed. This meant a different approach had to be taken. Experimental prototypes were built and flown during 2012 to 2014 to test the idea of propulsive landings and gain experience. SpaceX first announced in March 2013 that it would instrument and equip subsequent Falcon 9 first stages as controlled-descent test vehicles, able to propulsively decelerate towards a soft touchdown over the water surface. The company expected to begin these flight tests in 2013, with an attempt to return the vehicle to the launch site for a powered landing no earlier than mid-2014. In the event, SpaceX did perform their first controlled-descent test flight in 2013 but continued the over-water testing well into 2015. Following analysis of telemetry data from the first controlled descent in September 2013, SpaceX announced that a large amount of new technology passed their real-life test objectives, and that coupled with the technology advancements made on the Grasshopper prototype, they were now ready to test the full EDL process to recover the first stage. The rocket was \\"able to successfully transition from vacuum through hypersonic, through supersonic, through transonic, and light the engines all the way and control the stage all the way through [the atmosphere]\\". This second EDL test took place during the third cargo resupply mission for NASA in April 2014. SpaceX attached landing legs to the first stage, decelerated the stage through atmospheric re-entry and attempted a simulated landing over water, following the separation of the second stage carrying the Dragon capsule to the ISS. The first stage was slowed down sufficiently to perform a soft touchdown over the Atlantic Ocean. SpaceX announced in February 2014 that they intended to continue over-water tests of the first stage until mastering precision control of the vehicle from hypersonic speed all the way through subsonic regimes. Subsequent tests, starting with the CRS-5 mission in January 2015, attempted to land the first stage on an autonomous spaceport drone ship stationed off the Florida coastline or in the Pacific Ocean depending on launch site. The ships were used for six landing attempts, two of which succeeded in April and May 2016. Meanwhile, the first attempt to land on solid ground at Cape Canaveral occurred on December 21, 2015, and succeeded flawlessly.  Post-mission test plan  Thermal imaging of the controlled-descent test from stage separation onward, on Falcon 9 flight 13, September 21, 2014. Footage shows the first stage maneuvering out of the second stage plume; coasting near peak altitude of approximately ; performing a boost-back burn to limit downrange distance; controlled ballistic descent; and reentry burn from approximately to altitude. Landing burn is not visible, as clouds obscured the infrared imaging at low altitude. The post-mission Falcon 9 test plan for the earliest flight tests called for the first stage to perform a retro-propulsion burn in the upper atmosphere to slow it down and put it on a descent ballistic trajectory to its target landing location, followed by a second burn in the lower atmosphere before the first stage reached the water. SpaceX announced in March 2013 that it intended to conduct such tests on Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicles and would \\"continue doing such tests until they can do a return to the launch site and a powered landing\\". The company said it expected several failures before it could land the vehicle successfully. In detailed information disclosed in the Falcon 9 flight 6 launch license for the CASSIOPE mission, SpaceX said it would fire three of the nine Merlin 1D engines initially to slow the horizontal velocity of the rocket and begin the attempt at a controlled descent. Then, shortly before hitting the ocean, one engine would be relighted in an attempt to reduce the stage's speed so that it could be recovered. , SpaceX said the experiment had approximately a ten percent chance of success. SpaceX did not perform controlled-descent tests on all Falcon 9 v1.1 flights, as payloads going to GTO did not leave enough fuel margin. In September 2013, SpaceX announced that the CRS-3 mission of April 2014 (fourth flight of Falcon 9 v1.1) would be the second test of the descent test profile. Whereas the early tests restarted the engines only twice, by the fourth flight test, in September 2014, SpaceX was reigniting the engines three times to accomplish its EDL test objectives (although only three of the nine engines were used): a boost-back burn, a reentry burn, and a landing burn. The boost-back burn limits downrange translation of the used stage; the reentry burn (from approximately altitude) is used to control the descent and deceleration profile at atmospheric interface; and the landing burn completes the deceleration from terminal velocity to zero at the landing surface.  Test flights  = Ocean touchdown attempts =  Flight 6  The first propulsive reentry, descent, and ocean-surface touchdown test occurred on September 29, 2013, on Falcon 9 flight 6, the maiden launch of the Falcon 9 rocket, version v1.1. After the three-minute boost phase and separation of the second stage with the CASSIOPE and nanosat payloads, the rocket's first stage was reoriented backwards and three of the nine Merlin 1D engines were reignited at high altitude to initiate a deceleration and controlled descent trajectory to the surface of the ocean. The first phase of the test \\"worked well and the first stage re-entered safely\\". However, the stage began to roll because of aerodynamic forces during the atmospheric descent and the roll rate exceeded the capabilities of the first stage attitude control system (ACS) to null it out. The fuel in the tanks \\"centrifuged\\" to the outside of the tank and the single engine involved in the low-altitude deceleration maneuver shut down. SpaceX was able to retrieve some first-stage debris from the ocean. The company did not expect to recover the first stage on this flight, nor on the first several powered-descent tests, as predicted in their March 2013 announcement. This first experimental descent was considered successful, achieving substantial test milestones and collecting a great deal of engineering data, despite losing the stage into the ocean. SpaceX tested a large amount of new technology on this flight, and, combining those results with the advances made on the Grasshopper demonstrator, the company now believed it had \\"all the pieces of the puzzle\\".  Flight 9  The second test of controlled-descent hardware and software on the first stage occurred on April 8, 2014, and became the first successful controlled ocean soft touchdown of a liquid-rocket-engine orbital first stage. The first stage included landing legs for the first time which were extended to simulate a landing upon touchdown, and the test utilized more powerful gaseous Nitrogen control thrusters to control the aerodynamic-induced rotation that had occurred on the first test flight. The first stage successfully approached the water surface with no spin and at zero vertical velocity, as designed. During the second test, the first stage was traveling at a velocity of at an altitude of at the time of the high-altitude turn-around maneuver, followed by ignition of three of the nine main engines for the initial deceleration and placement onto its descent trajectory. The \\"first stage executed a good re- entry burn and was able to stabilize itself on the way down. ... [The] landing in [the] Atlantic [ocean] was good! ... Flight computers continued transmitting [telemetry data] for eight seconds after reaching the water\\" and stopped only after the first stage went horizontal. The major modifications for the second first stage controlled-descent test flight included changes to both the reentry burn and the landing burn as well as adding increased attitude control system (ACS) capabilities. SpaceX had projected a low probability of stage recovery following the flight test due to complexity of the test sequence and the large number of steps that would need to be carried out perfectly. The company was careful to label the entire flight test as \\"an experiment\\". In a press conference at the National Press Club on April 25, Elon Musk said that the first stage achieved a soft touchdown on the ocean but due to rough seas, the stage was destroyed.  Flight 10  The third test flight of a returned first stage was July 14, 2014, on Falcon 9 flight 10. Whereas the previous test reached a target landing area some hundreds of kilometers off the Florida coast, this flight aimed for a boost-back trajectory that would attempt the ocean touchdown much nearer the coast, and closer to the original launch location at Cape Canaveral. Following the third controlled-descent test flight, SpaceX expressed confidence in their ability to successfully land in the future on a \\"floating launch pad or back at the launch site and refly the rocket with no required refurbishment.\\" Following the first stage loft of the second stage and payload on its orbital trajectory, SpaceX conducted a successful flight test on the spent first stage. The first stage successfully decelerated from hypersonic speed in the upper atmosphere, made a successful reentry, landing burn, and deployment of its landing legs, and touched down on the ocean surface. The first stage was not recovered for analysis as the hull integrity was breached, either upon touchdown or on the subsequent \\"tip over and body slam\\". Results of the post- landing analysis showed that the hull integrity was lost as the -tall first stage fell horizontally, as planned, onto the ocean surface following the landing.  Flight 13  Infrared thermal imagery of Falcon 9 SpaceX CRS-4 launch. The larger image was captured shortly after second stage separation from the first stage: the top of the first stage appears as a dim dot below the larger plume. In the inset, the restarted first stage engines power the stage. The fourth test flight of a returned first stage, with a planned ocean touchdown, occurred on Falcon 9 flight 13 which was launched on September 21, 2014. and the first stage flew a profile approaching a zero-velocity at zero- altitude simulated landing on the sea surface. SpaceX made no attempt to recover the first stage, since earlier tests had confirmed that the 14-story tall first stage would not survive the tip-over event into the sea. The booster did run out of liquid oxygen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvim4rsNHkQ&t;=32s One month later, detailed thermal imaging infrared sensor data and video were released of the controlled-descent test. The data was collected by NASA in a joint arrangement with SpaceX as part of research on retropropulsive deceleration technologies in order to develop new approaches to Mars atmospheric entry. A key problem with propulsive techniques is handling the fluid flow problems and attitude control of the descent vehicle during the supersonic retropropulsion phase of the entry and deceleration. All phases of the night-time flight test on the first stage were successfully imaged except for the final landing burn, as that occurred below the clouds where the IR data was not visible. The research team is particularly interested in the altitude range of the SpaceX \\"reentry burn\\" on the Falcon 9 Earth-entry tests as this is the \\"powered flight through the Mars-relevant retropulsion regime\\" that models Mars entry and descent conditions.  Flight 15  Falcon 9 flight 15 first stage re-entry with grid fins. Onboard camera view SpaceX had planned to make the sixth controlled-descent test flight and second landing attempt on their drone ship no earlier than February 11, 2015. Landing a returning rocket at sea would have been a \\"potentially historic rocket launch and landing\\", as such a feat \\"was unheard of\\" five years earlier. According to regulatory paperwork filed in 2014, SpaceX plans had called for the sixth test flight to occur on a late January 2015 launch attempt. However, after the completion of the fifth test flight, and with some damage being incurred by the drone ship in the botched landing, it was not clear whether the sixth test would still be feasible only a few weeks later. This issue was resolved within days of the ship's return to Jacksonville, and by January 15, SpaceX was unambiguous about its plans to attempt a landing of the first stage following the boost phase of the Deep Space Climate Observatory mission. However, in a statement by SpaceX, the drone ship was in conditions \\"with waves reaching up to three stories in height crashing over the decks\\". Additionally, one of the four thrusters that keep the barge in a constant position had malfunctioned, making station- keeping difficult. For these reasons, the post-launch flight test did not involve the barge, but instead attempted a soft touchdown over water. The test was successful, and the first stage of the Falcon 9 landed \\"nicely vertical\\" with an accuracy of 10 meters from the target location in the ocean. Therefore, this test represented the fifth ocean touchdown, and the sixth overall Falcon 9 first stage controlled-descent test. Flight 46 and 48  Flight 46 and 48 were both boosters on their second flight that were not recovered due to the older Block 3 design only being capable of two flights. Instead of having an uncontrolled descent, SpaceX softly landed both boosters in the water to test high energy landing techniques without the risk of damaging a drone ship. On flight 48, the booster survived landing and stayed intact after tipping over. Unplanned recovery was discussed but the booster broke up before it could be attempted. = Landing attempts = Depiction of Falcon 9 landing trajectory in floating-platform recovery tests , SpaceX has attempted 47 landings of a first stage on a solid surface, 40 of which have succeeded. In July 2014, SpaceX announced that the fifth and sixth controlled- descent test flights would attempt to land on a solid surface, merging the lessons from the high-altitude envelope expansion of the first four controlled-descent flights over water with the low-altitude lessons of the F9R Dev testing in Texas. At that time, the \\"solid surface\\" was not further described, and was later revealed to be a seafaring barge dubbed an autonomous spaceport drone ship. Many of the test objectives were achieved on the first attempt, including bringing the stage to the specific location of the floating platform and collecting a large amount of test data with the first use of grid fin control surfaces for more precise reentry positioning. However the touchdown on the corner of the barge was a hard landing and most of the rocket body fell into the ocean and sank; SpaceX published a short clip of the crash. It would take four more attempts to achieve the first barge landing at sea on flight 23. Meanwhile, ground landing succeeded on the first attempt with flight 20 on December 21, 2015. In October 2014, SpaceX clarified that the \\"solid surface\\" would be a floating platform constructed from a barge in Louisiana, and confirmed that they would attempt to land the first stage of the fourteenth Falcon 9 flight on the platform. For the landing to succeed, the -wide span of the rocket landing legs must not only land within the -wide barge deck, but would need to also deal with ocean swell and GPS errors. In late November, SpaceX revealed that the landing barge would be capable of autonomous operation and would not need to be anchored or moored; it was hence called an autonomous spaceport drone ship. three of these ships had been built, two of which were operational.  Flight 14  This fifth controlled-descent test flight was anticipated by the specialized press as a historic core return attempt. It incorporated for the first time in an orbital mission the grid fin aerodynamic control surfaces that had previously been tested only during a low-altitude, low-speed test with the F9R Dev1 prototype vehicle in early 2014. The addition of grid fins, with continuation of the control authority obtained from gimbaling the engines as on previous test flights, was projected to improve the landing accuracy to , a thousand-fold improvement over the four previous test flights which landed within of their target coordinates. Prior to the flight, SpaceX projected that the likelihood of success on the first try was 50 percent or less. The first test flight for this new hardware occurred on January 10, 2015, on the CRS-5 mission for NASA. The controlled-descent flight started approximately three minutes after launch, following the second stage separation event, when the first stage was approximately high and moving at a velocity of . The SpaceX webcast indicated that the boostback burn and reentry burns for the descending first stage occurred, and that the descending rocket then went \\"below the horizon,\\" as expected, which eliminated the live telemetry signal, so that the retropropulsive landing attempt was not shown live. Shortly thereafter, SpaceX released information that the rocket did get to the drone ship as planned, but \\"landed hard ... Ship itself is fine. Some of the support equipment on the deck will need to be replaced.\\" Musk later elaborated that the rocket's flight-control surfaces had exhausted their supply of hydraulic fluid prior to impact. Musk posted photos of the impact while talking to John Carmack on Twitter. SpaceX later released a video of the impact on Vine.  Flight 17  A seventh test flight of the first stage controlled-descent profile occurred on April 14, 2015, on Falcon 9 flight 17, which carried CRS-6 to the International Space Station. This was SpaceX's second attempt to land on a floating platform. The first stage was fitted with grid fins and landing legs to facilitate the post-mission test. An early report from Elon Musk suggested that the first stage made a hard landing on the drone ship. Musk later clarified that the bipropellant valve was stuck, and therefore the control system could not react rapidly enough for a successful landing. On April 15, SpaceX released a video of the terminal phase of the descent, the landing, the tip over, and the resulting deflagration as the stage broke up on the deck of the ASDS.CRS-6 First Stage Landing, SpaceX, April 15, 2015.  Flight 20: first landing on ground pad  The first attempt to land the first stage of Falcon 9 on a ground pad near the launch site occurred on flight 20, the maiden flight of the Falcon 9 Full Thrust version, on the evening of December 21, 2015. The landing was successful and the first stage was recovered. This was the first time in history that a rocket first stage returned to Earth after propelling an orbital launch mission and achieved a controlled vertical landing. SpaceX applied to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) US regulatory authority to perform its eighth booster controlled-descent test culminating with a landing attempt at the Landing Zone 1 facility (formerly Launch Complex 13) that SpaceX had recently built at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The FAA cleared SpaceX to attempt this landing after assessing that it would inflict minimal damage on the environment. Additionally, NASA planned to close the NASA Causeway near the launch and landing site and significantly increase the size of exclusion zones during the launch and landing attempt. Both options to attempt landing on the ground pad or on the drone ship at sea remained open until the day of the launch. The final decision to return the booster to Cape Canaveral was made based on a number of factors, including weather at the potential landing sites. Flight 20 took off at 20:29 EST on December 21, 2015 (01:29 UTC on December 22, 2015). About 9 minutes and 45 seconds later, the first stage landed vertically on the pad. SpaceX does not plan to fly the Falcon 9 flight 20 first stage again. Rather, the rocket was inspected and moved back to the launch pad a few miles north to perform a static fire test. After the hot fire test, the vehicle was evaluated in detail by SpaceX to assess capabilities for reflight of the launch vehicle design after future landings. On December 31, SpaceX announced that no damage had been found on the stage and that it was ready to fire again. On January 15, 2016, SpaceX conducted the static fire test on the recovered booster and reported a good overall outcome, except for some thrust fluctuations in one of the outer engines (engine 9). Elon Musk reported that this may have been due to debris ingestion. This booster has been on display outside of SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California since August 20, 2016.  Flight 21  Flight 21, the final launch of a Falcon 9 v1.1, carried the Jason 3 payload. At one point this was the first possible opportunity for an attempt to land the first stage on land, but the launches were reordered following the loss of Falcon 9 flight 19 in June 2015. Jason-3 was successfully launched on January 17, 2016, and while the first stage managed to slow down towards a soft landing, the lockout collet on one of the landing legs did not latch correctly, which caused the rocket to fall over and explode after touching down. Elon Musk noted that ice buildup on the collet from the high-humidity launch conditions may have led to the failure of the latch.  Flight 22  On March 4, 2016 the Falcon 9 flight 22 launched the heavy SES-9 communications satellite, the rocket's largest payload yet targeting a highly- energetic geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). Consequently, the Falcon 9 first stage followed a ballistic trajectory after separation and re-entered the atmosphere at high velocity with very little fuel to mitigate potential aerodynamic damage. Therefore, SpaceX did not expect to successfully land its Falcon 9 booster on its sea barge, the Of Course I Still Love You, positioned in the Atlantic Ocean. Elon Musk confirmed in a tweet that the landing attempt had failed.  Flight 23: first landing on a drone ship  On April 8, 2016, Falcon 9 flight 23, the third flight of the full-thrust version, delivered the SpaceX CRS-8 cargo on its way to the International Space Station while the first stage conducted a boostback and re-entry maneuver over the Atlantic Ocean. Nine minutes after liftoff, the booster landed vertically on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You, from the Florida coastline, achieving a long-sought-after milestone for the SpaceX reusability development program. This stage, serial number B1021, was refurbished and flown again in March 2017 for the SES-10 mission, setting another milestone in the development of reusable rockets.  Flight 24: first return from GTO mission  On May 6, 2016, Falcon 9 flight 24 delivered the JCSAT-14 satellite on a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) while the first stage conducted a re-entry burn under ballistic conditions without prior boostback. Following the controlled descent through the atmosphere, the booster executed a short landing burn as it approached the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You, and succeeded in landing vertically. This second landing at sea was more difficult than the previous one because the booster at separation was traveling about compared to on the CRS-8 launch to low Earth orbit. Pursuing their experiments to test the limits of the flight envelope, SpaceX opted for a shorter landing burn with three engines instead of the single-engine burns seen in earlier attempts; this approach consumes less fuel by leaving the stage in free fall as long as possible and decelerating more sharply, thereby minimizing the amount of energy expended to counter gravity. Elon Musk indicated this first stage may not be flown again and will instead be used as a life leader for ground tests to confirm future first stage rockets are good.  Flight 25  On May 27, 2016, Falcon 9 flight 25 delivered THAICOM 8 to a supersynchronous transfer orbit; despite high re-entry speed, the first stage again landed successfully on the SpaceX drone ship. The landing crushed a \\"crush core\\" in one leg, leading to a notable tilt to the stage as it stood on the drone ship.  Flight 26  On June 15, 2016, Falcon 9 flight 26 successfully delivered the Eutelsat 117W B and ABS 2A satellites into GTO. The first stage conducted a re-entry burn and successfully deployed its grid fins, before attempting a landing on the barge. The landing failed in its final moments due to low thrust on one of the first stage engines, caused by the exhaustion of its liquid oxygen fuel supply. That caused the engines to shut down early while the first stage was just above the drone's deck, causing a landing failure.  Flight 27  In the early hours of July 18, 2016, Falcon 9 flight 27, carrying the Dragon spacecraft for the CRS-9 mission was followed by a successful landing of the first stage at Landing Zone 1, Cape Canaveral.SpaceX launches space station docking port for NASA, The Associated Press, July 18, 2016  Flight 28  On August 14, 2016, the Falcon 9 flight 28 successfully propelled the Japanese JCSAT-16 telecommunications satellite to a geosynchronous transfer orbit. The first stage re-entered the atmosphere and landed vertically on the Of Course I Still Love You drone ship that was located in the Atlantic Ocean.  Transition to routine reuse  SpaceX continued to return a number of first stages in both ground and sea landings to clarify the procedures needed to re-use flown boosters. The company had hoped to begin offering pre-flown Falcon 9 rocket stages commercially by the end of 2016, but the first re-used booster eventually took off on March 30, 2017 with the SES-10 mission. The booster performed well and was recovered a second time. In January 2016 Musk evaluated the likelihood of success to approximately 70 percent for landing attempts in 2016, hopefully rising to 90 percent in 2017; he also cautioned that the company expected \\"a few more RUDs\\", referring to the term Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly, a humorous euphemism for destruction of the vehicle. Musk's prediction were close to the actual numbers, as five out of eight flown boosters () were recovered in 2016, and 14 out of 14 () in 2017. Three GTO missions for heavy payloads were flown in an expendable configuration, not equipped for landing. Five boosters were flown a second time in 2017, marking the beginning of routine reuse of boosters. In 2018 and 2019, more than half of the missions were flown with reused boosters.

It first aired on FX on July 13, 2014.  Plot  A disturbance inside the cargo hold of an inbound jet to JFK International Airport alarms the flight crew. Upon landing, the plane immediately loses all contact with ground control and all but one window shade are drawn. It is feared everyone aboard is incapacitated, possibly by a contagion or some other mechanism. The CDC Canary team, headed by Dr. Ephraim Goodweather, is called to investigate. Goodweather and Dr. Nora Martinez enter the plane, finding all passengers seemingly dead. They also discover strange parasitic worms on the plane and fear an Ebola-like plague could break out. Four people are unexpectedly found alive, including the pilot, Doyle Redfern, though none know what happened. While at JFK, Goodweather is approached by Abraham Setrakian, an elderly Armenian Harlem pawnbroker who insists the victims' bodies must be destroyed and the elaborately carved, coffin-like cabinet that was removed from the stricken plane's hold must not leave the airport. Meanwhile, recently paroled Gus Elizalde is hired by Mr. Eichhorst, a mysterious man connected to Eldrich Palmer, a wealthy and powerful entrepreneur. Gus is to retrieve the cabinet from the airport, and Eichhorst assures him there will be no difficulty in removing it. When Eph and Nora discover the cabinet missing, they are unaware that Jim Kent, their CDC co-worker, has improperly allowed its release from the quarantine area. An airport official is attacked and killed by an enormous human-like creature that uses a throat appendage to suck out blood, before smashing his head.  Production  In September 2012, it was announced that FX had acquired the rights to The Strain trilogy of novels by Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan, and ordered a pilot episode to be directed and executive produced by del Toro and co-written by del Toro and Hogan. Carlton Cuse would help develop the project and serve as executive producer and showrunner on the series, which was envisioned as having a limited run of three to five seasons. The pilot episode began principal photography on September 17, 2013, in Toronto, Canada. The 13-episode series order was announced on November 19, 2013. The airport scenes were filmed at Toronto International Airport, and the interior airplane scenes were filmed on the same set used in Stoll's previous film Non-Stop. The pilot adapts the first 150 pages of the first novel, which is 300 pages long. The remainder of the first season comprises an expanded version of the novel's second half. Lauren Lee Smith was originally cast as Kelly Goodweather, but was replaced by Natalie Brown two weeks before production on the pilot began. John Hurt played Abraham Setrakian in the original version of the pilot. Principal photography was postponed to accommodate Hurt's shooting schedule. Hurt dropped out after filming, and was replaced by David Bradley for the series; del Toro reshot Hurt's scenes with the new actor.  Reception  Early reviews followed the episode's world premiere at the ATX Television Festival in Austin, Texas in June 2014. Writing for the International Business Times, Amanda Remling called it \\"one of del Toro's most jaw-dropping creations yet\\", praising the focus on suspense rather than gore, and favorably compared the \\"insane\\" closing sequence to the \\"mind- blowing deaths\\" on Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead. Meredith Borders of Badass Digest said that the pilot looked \\"incredibly cinematic and, frankly, expensive\\", but opined that it would have benefited from a longer runtime and slower pace. She said that the episode was not necessarily scary, but \\"a lot of fun\\", with moments that were \\"incredibly gory in a way that will make the most ardent grue-lover clap with glee\\". She praised the cast, particularly Corey Stoll, who had her \\"rooting for a complicated character in the first sixty seconds of our acquaintance with him\\". Elizabeth Harper of The Escapist wrote that the episode had \\"the look and feel of del Toro's work\\" and was particularly reminiscent of Pacific Rim, \\"spinning a brightly colored world inhabited by an equally vibrant cast of characters.\\" She said that the characters, while not \\"entirely unique\\", display \\"quirks that give them life beyond simple stereotypes\\", and wrote that the moody and dramatic lighting, while unnatural, added to the supernatural feeling and created a fittingly stylized world.

Casti (born 1943) is an author, mathematician, and entrepreneur. Author Casti has written more than 120 scientific articles and seven technical monographs and textbooks on mathematical modeling. He was also the former editor of the journals Applied Mathematics & Computation (Elsevier, New York) and Complexity (Wiley, New York). In 1989 his text/reference works Alternate Realities: Mathematical Models of Nature and Man (Wiley, 1989) was awarded a prize by the Association of American Publishers in a competition among all scholarly books published in mathematics and the natural sciences.Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Astronomy, (1989) Honorable Mention, presented to John Wiley and Sons for Alternate Realities: Mathematical Models of Nature and Man by John Casti by the Association of American Publishers Professional and Scholarly Publishing Division. In 1992, he also published Reality Rules (Wiley, New York), a two-volume text on mathematical modeling. He has written fourteen popular books on science. These include Paradigms Lost: Images of Man in the Mirror of Science (Morrow, NY, 1989), which addresses several of the most puzzling controversies in modern science, Searching for Certainty: What Scientists Can Know About the Future (Morrow, NY, 1991), a volume dealing with problems of scientific prediction and explanation of everyday events like the weather, stock market price movements and the outbreak of warfare, and Complexification (HarperCollins, NY, 1994), a study of complex systems and the manner in which they give rise to counterintuitive, surprising behavior. Dr. Casti has also written three popular volumes on mathematics: Five Golden Rules: Great Theories of 20th- Century Mathematics---and Why They Matter; a sequel, Five More Golden Rules (1995, 2000) both published by John Wiley & Sons (New York); and Mathematical Mountaintops: The Five Most Famous Problems of All Time, published and later recalled by Oxford University Press (New York). In addition, in 1996 he published Would-Be Worlds, a volume on computer simulation and the way it promises to change the way we do science, also published by John Wiley & Sons (New York). In 1998 he published a volume of scientific fiction, involving Ludwig Wittgenstein, Alan Turing, J. B. S. Haldane, C. P. Snow and Erwin Schr√∂dinger in a fictional dinner-party conversation centered about the question of the uniqueness of human cognition and the possibility of thinking machines. This book was published under the title The Cambridge Quintet by Little, Brown (London) in December 1997 and by Addison-Wesley in the US in early 1998. More recently, his published books include Art & Complexity (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 2005), a volume edited with A. Karlqvist, as well as a short volume on the life of the Austrian logician, Kurt G√∂del, the book G√∂del: A Life of Logic (Perseus Books, Cambridge, MA, 2003). In the same year he published the volume, The One, True, Platonic Heaven (Joseph Henry Press, Washington, DC, 2003), which addresses in a fictional format the question of the limits to scientific knowledge. The volume on art and complexity sparked off a continuing interest in the interrelationship between complex systems and artistic forms of all types, which is reflected in a set of papers currently in preparation addressing the complexity of scientific theories regarded as artistic forms. Recently, Casti turned his attention to writing fiction. He has recently written a neo-noir thriller entitled Prey for Me. Mathematician As a mathematician and researcher, Casti received his Ph.D. under Richard Bellman at the University of Southern California. He worked at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California, and served on the faculties of the University of Arizona, New York University and Princeton University, before moving to Vienna in 1973 to become one of the first members of the research staff at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. In 1986, he left IIASA to take up a position as a professor of operations research and system theory at the Technical University of Vienna. He also served as a member of the External Faculty of the Santa Fe Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, from 1992‚Äì2002, where he worked extensively on the application of biological metaphors to the mathematical modeling of problems in economics, finance and road-traffic networks, as well as on large-scale computer simulations for the study of such networks. His primary research interests have shifted somewhat in recent years from the natural sciences to the exploration of questions in the social and behavioral realm. One thread has been exploration of the relationship between the social \\"mood\\" of a population and its biasing effect on actions and behaviors. In this direction, his 2010 book, Mood Matters: From Rising Skirt Lengths to the Collapse of World Powers, published by Copernicus Books, NY, addresses the directions and patterns of social causation and their implications for future trends and collective social events, such as styles in popular culture, the outcome of political processes, and even the rise and fall of civilizations. His most recent book is X-EVENTS: The Collapse of Everything, which addresses the underlying cause of extreme events generated by human inattention, misunderstanding, error, stupidity and/or malevolent intent.Austin Allen, What If Everything Went Straight to Hell?, 2012, An interview with John Casti http://bigthink.com/book-think/what-if-everything- went-straight-to-hell The English original edition was published in June 2012 by HarperCollins/Morrow, New York. The book now exists in 15 foreign editions, as well, including German, Japanese, Russian, Dutch, Korean and Portuguese. Entrepreneur Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ Casti formed two companies in Santa Fe and London in 2000, Qforma, Inc. and SimWorld, Ltd, respectively, devoted to the employment of tools and concepts from modern system theory for the solution of problems in business and finance, as well as health care. Qforma merged with SkilaMederi in June 2013.Qforma and SkilaMederi announce merger. In early 2005 he returned to Vienna, where he co-founded The Kenos Circle, a professional society that aims to make use of complexity science in order to gain a deeper insight into the future than that offered by more conventional statistical tools. For several years, Professor Casti was a Senior Research Scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria, where he created an initiative for the study on Extreme Events in Human Society. In January 2012 he left IIASA to form a new research institute in Vienna, The X-Center,X-Center Network http://xcenternetwork.com devoted to the study of human-caused extreme events.John Casti, How the World Works, 2013, TEDx Vienna https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAPtj0RSL0I The X-Center has now expanded to a network of affiliated X-Centers in Helsinki, Tokyo, Seoul, New York and Singapore.

A lifelong resident of Ohio, he is a former grocery executive, and is now a film producer and an active investor in a number of small businesses. Early life and education Iott is the son of grocers Wallace \\"Wally\\" Iott and Jeanette Iott of Toledo, Ohio. He attended parochial grade school and graduated from Sylvania High School (now Northview) in 1969. Iott wanted to enlist in the military during the Vietnam War era, but was refused due to a heart murmur. He attended Hillsdale College, but did not graduate. Career He worked in the family grocery business, which grew to be the Seaway Food Town regional chain of 75 supermarkets and drug stores. He started out in clerk jobs in 1966 then moved up into management, becoming the President of the corporation in 1989. He was CEO from 1996 until the business was merged with Spartan Stores in 2000. Since leaving the grocery business, Iott has become involved with start-up companies, ranging from 3D imaging to salsa making. He is also a filmmaker, producing over thirty feature films, mainly as an executive producer, between 2007 and the present, including films for the SyFy Channel, Lifetime Channel, a 3D family film Call of the Wild and the multiple award-winning Beautiful Boy starring Michael Sheen and Maria Bello. He was co-founder of Toledo's Black Swamp International Film Festival in 2009 and is also a member of the Producer's Guild of America (PGA). Military service Beginning in 1982, Iott served in the Ohio Military Reserve (OHMR), a State Defense Force that is trained to provide logistics and resource support during disasters or threats to homeland security. Iott is a graduate of the United States Marine Corps Command and General Staff College and the United States Air Force Air War College. He also holds a parachutist rating from both the Israeli Defense Force and the Army of The Netherlands. He retired at the rank of Colonel in April 2016 after more than 32 years of service. His last assignment was as the Deputy Commander of the OHMR. Iott is the recipient of the State of Ohio Distinguished Service Medal. Community service Iott has been on numerous community boards over the years including the Toledo Zoo, the Toledo Chamber of Commerce, St. Ursula Academy, St. John‚Äôs Jesuit, Erie Shores Council of the Boy Scouts, and St. Luke‚Äôs Hospital. He was Chairman of the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants. As president of the Iott Foundation, Iott funded the construction of a three-story expansion of St. Ursula's all-girls Catholic high school in 2006; The Iott Center at St. John's Jesuit, an all-boys Catholic high school in 2009, and the Iott Scout Shop at the new Erie Shores Council, B.S.A. headquarters in 2013. 2010 U.S. Congressional campaign Iott began his run for Congress as an independent, announcing his candidacy in late January 2010. Of his lack of political experience, Iott said, \\"That is exactly my qualification,\\" and, \\"I am not a politician, never have been, and don't intend to become one.\\" Following complaints by members of the Tea Party movement that having a conservative independent and a conservative Republican on the November ballot would split the vote, Iott dropped his independent candidacy and ran in the Republican primary against Jack Smith, a retired Toledo police chief and Vietnam veteran. Iott defeated Smith on May 4, with 12,668 votes to Smith's 4,729. Iott's opponent in the general election was Democratic nominee Marcy Kaptur; initially Libertarian candidate Jeremy D. Swartz who withdrew so the Libertarian Party of Ohio replaced him by appointing Joseph Michael Jaffe. Several media outlets described Iott as a Tea Party favorite. His campaign was largely self-financed, with $823,100 in loan contributions coming from Iott as of June 30, 2010.2010 Race: Ohio District 09, OpenSecrets.org, June 30, 2010 As of September 30, Iott had raised and spent $1.5 million, with approximately $1.4 million in candidate self-financing through loans. Iott lost the election to incumbent Democrat Marcy Kaptur by 35,822 votes.http://www.morningjournal.com/articles/2010/11/03/news/erie_huron/doc4cd0e9ceb4a0e585921307.txt He won Ottawa and Lorain counties, split Erie county and lost Lucas county. This represented a 59%-41% victory. \\"Who Killed Food Town\\" controversy The Kaptur Campaign maintained that Iott was unfit for office because he had \\"run the company into the ground\\", \\"took the money and ran\\", and put \\"5,000 people out of work\\". This was promoted through an intense television, radio, newspaper, and social media campaign, with the assistance of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union local. Reporters Lara Seligman, Michael Morse and Eugene Kiely of FactCheck.Org released a well researched story on September 17, 2010, which stated that the allegations were all false and misleading. The article said \\"the company prospered during the years that Rich Iott served as president and CEO, from 1996 to 2000. In July 1999, the company reported its best ever third-quarter financial results. During the fiscal 1999 third quarter, the company reported that sales increased 8.3 percent to $167.3 million, up from $154.6 million the year before. The company opened three new stores between 1998 and 1999.\\" In October 1999, the Cleveland Plain Dealer described Seaway Food Town as a \\"well run\\" hometown grocery store that would be attractive to larger companies at a time when the industry was consolidating. \\"In the last six months, the company‚Äôs stock has jumped 130 percent, coming off a fiscal year that saw earnings jump 8 percent to $167.3 million. And from 1994 to 1998, earnings catapulted 300 percent on revenues that increased only 14 percent during the same period.\\" FactCheck.Org goes on to say it was \\"wrong to blame Iott for \\"closing our neighborhood stores,\\" and it goes too far in blaming him for \\"costing 5,000 people their jobs.\\" Although he was a major player in the decision to merge Food Town with Spartan Stores, there is no evidence that he was involved in the decisions to close Food Town stores. In the end, the ad‚Äôs summary charge ‚Äî that Iott \\"doesn‚Äôt create jobs, he sells them off\\" ‚Äî misrepresents what happened to Food Town and its employees, and who was responsible for it.\\" Spartan did not close the stores until 2003 - three years after Iott had left the company. The Toledo Blade, the local newspaper, also drew the same conclusions, giving Representative Kaptur the chance to recant or revise her allegations. She chose, instead, to stand by her statements. Waffen-SS reenactment controversy Iott received national media attention in October 2010 when it was reported in The Atlantic that he was a member of a Waffen-SS reenactment group that portrays the German SS Division Wiking (German for 'Viking'). The Atlantic also published two pictures of Iott dressed as an SS man that were replicated virally on the internet and by other news sources. Iott told The Atlantic that his interest was historical and that he absolutely does not agree with the tenets of Nazism. He said he joined because reenactments were a hobby and a father-son bonding experience, and that he has participated in a range of reenactments over the years including as a Union Army soldier in the American Civil War, and as American soldiers in World War I and II. Iott's campaign said the candidate had not engaged in any reenactments for about five years. According to the Toledo Free Press, Iott joined the group in 2002 and was listed on the membership rolls through 2008. In response to the ensuing criticism, Iott said he never intended disrespect towards anyone through his reenactments, and later said the story was a coordinated character assassination attempt by his opponent to distract from the issues. Swastikas were found painted on several of Iott's campaign lawn signs on October 13, 2010, with Iott accusing the Kaptur campaign of \\"inciting these hateful actions\\". A Holocaust survivors' group said that Iott's wearing of the SS uniform was \\"disgraceful\\", and the Republican Jewish Coalition called Iott unfit for office. A local rabbi predicted the reaction would be negative and would not be limited to Jewish people. The JTA News Service noted that Iott had not apologized. Some Republican leaders distanced themselves from Iott in the wake of the controversy. House Republican whip Eric Cantor, a member of the Jewish faith, told Fox News that he repudiated and did not support Iott's actions. The National Republican Congressional Committee removed Iott from its website list of preferred \\"contenders\\". A Jewish friend and movie business partner of Iott offered a defense, calling Iott one of the most pro Jewish and pro Israel people he knows. Toledo City Councilman Rob Ludeman said he was not withdrawing his support of Iott because of one incident in the past. The Lucas County GOP chief continued to back Iott, emphasizing that the county Republican Party organization did not condone Nazis, and adding the claim that this was nothing more than politically motivated mudslinging and an attempt to split the party. U.S. House Minority Leader John Boehner continued to solicit funds for Iott's campaign through his Freedom Project PAC. A Freedom Project spokesman said Boehner was not concerned about the reenactments turning off voters or donors. Endorsements The pro-life Susan B. Anthony List Candidate Fund endorsed Iott on July 13, saying he would be a supporter of pro-life issues. The political action committee of the National Federation of Independent Business endorsed Iott on September 23, based on Iott's positions on health care, taxes, and regulation. The Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (the lobbying arm of the Citizens Against Government Waste) endorsed Iott on October 6, saying he had signed the PAC's \\"No Pork Pledge\\" and was committed to fiscal conservatism, cutting taxes, and reducing the size of government. Other endorsements came from the Change the Congress in 2010 PAC and the Gun Owners of America Political Victory Fund which gave him a grade of A. Iott received a grade AQ from the NRA, which is an A based on how he answered the NRA's questionnaire, Selected political positions According to his campaign website, as a candidate Iott advanced these political positions in 2010: * He stated he would vote to repeal the 2010 health care reform legislation because he believes it is unconstitutional, a \\"job killer\\", and will lead to rationing. He stated he would vote for tort reform and would vote to make it possible for people to buy insurance across state lines. * He opposes the cap and trade energy bill and is in favor of market-driven solutions to energy problems. * He believes the government bailouts were unconstitutional, a waste of taxpayer money, and a violation of free market principles. * He pledged never to ask for earmarks when elected to Congress. * He believes the Social Security system needs to be reformed, but does not believe in privatizing it, increasing the retirement age, changing recipients' benefits, or raising taxes. * He believes in sealing the borders and deporting all illegal immigrants who come to the attention of law enforcement, and supports Arizona's controversial immigration legislation, Arizona SB 1070. * He believes that the Iraq War was a success, and supports an escalation of the War in Afghanistan. * He supports America's participation in international free trade agreements. * He believes that same-sex marriage is immoral but that making it illegal is a civil violation of equal rights. * He supports Israel's right to self-defense and says America has an obligation to support it; he opposes a Palestinian state formed by taking land from Israel and a divided Jerusalem, and believes that the UN has become irrelevant.

Horan acted an independent Member of Parliament after expulsion, and proposed starting a party in January 2013. In February 2014, the party registered a logo with the Electoral Commission.

The party launched its campaign on 29 July 2014 with a slogan of \\"safe children, safe whanau, safe society\\", and promising higher pensions and the removal of tertiary education fees. On 19 August, it announced its party list. The party emphasised electorate representation, and MPs were required to poll their electorates on major issues and vote accordingly. In the New Zealand General Election, held in September 2014, the party did not win any electorate seats, or enough percentage of the party vote to stay in Parliament. It attracted 872 voters, or 0.04% of total New Zealand voter share. The party was deregistered by the Electoral Commission on 20 May 2016.

Life  His father was a member of the Mecklenburg legislature. He attended the Realschule in Rostock, then was apprenticed to a surveyor in Schwaan.Ahrenshoop Kunst: Brief biography He aspired to be a shipbuilder, but was not sufficiently strong and robust for that type of work, so he remained with the surveyor for three more years as his assistant. At this time, he made the acquaintance of two young painters from a nearby art colony who encouraged him to develop an interest in painting. From 1860 to 1862, he attended the Polytechnikum in Munich, ostensibly to study geodesy and engineering but, instead, he frequented the local artists' studios where he got to know Adolf Heinrich Lier and began taking lessons from one of Lier's friends. Nevertheless, he finished his course at the Polytechnikum and, after a short training period in Rostock, took the engineering exam. He then worked in the land surveying office of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and painted in his spare time. His work attracted the attention of the Court Painter, :de:Theodor Schloepke, who obtained a scholarship for him from Grand Duke Friedrich Franz II. He began his formal studies in 1873 at the Weimar Saxon- Grand Ducal Art School under Theodor Hagen. Despite the scholarship, he experienced continuing financial problems. His paintings did not sell very well. Many were bought by the Grand Duke and his court for a nominal sum. Finally, in 1879, he was offered the position of art conservator and restorer for the Ducal collection. He was given a generous contract that allowed him plenty of space and time to pursue his own work. This freedom was used to travel extensively. The area around Ahrenshoop was especially inspiring to him. In 1890, Grand Duke Friedrich Franz III appointed him a Professor. After 1903, he lived in the village of Ostorf near Lake Schwerin. He retired in 1915 and was presented with the Knight's Cross of the Order of the Griffon. A proposed retrospective of his work had to be cancelled due to the war and was not presented until 1923, after his death. Approximately 260 of his paintings are in the possession of the Staatliches Museum Schwerin. Ninety-two were destroyed during World War II. A street in Schwerin has been named after him.Stressenkatalog: Carl-Malchin-Stra√üe References  Further reading  *Lisa J√ºr√ü: Carl Malchin : ein Maler aus Mecklenburg : 1838 - 1923.

History 'Surprise' is a smallish, round apple with a dull pale green or whitish-yellow skin and very tart red-tinged flesh. It is believed to be a descendant of Malus niedzwetskyana, a deeply red-fleshed apple native to Siberia and the Caucasus. Whereas other descendants of M. niedzwetskyana tend to have darkish- red flesh (such as a series of apples and crabapples developed by plant breeder Niels Ebbesen Hansen), Surprise and the cultivars based on it tend to have a brighter pinkish or light reddish flesh. The red pigmentation of the flesh comes mainly from a class of flavonoids called anthocyanins. Surprise began to circulate in Europe sometime before 1831, when it was reported growing in the London Horticultural Society Gardens. It was first brought to the United States by German immigrants to the Ohio Valley around 1840 and quickly intrigued plant breeders because of its unusually colored flesh. The horticulturist and landscape designer Andrew Jackson Downing and his brother Charles, a noted pomologist in his own right, had a tree of Surprise in their collection in Newburgh, New York. The Downings were not, in the end, very impressed with Surprise. In the 1890 edition of their book The Fruit and Fruit Trees of America, the Downings wrote it off as a \\"small, round, whitish yellow apple of little or no value, but admired by some for its singularity, the flesh being stained with red.\\" As a teenager in the 1870s, the horticulturist Liberty Hyde Bailey grafted Surprise onto a tree in his father's orchard in South Haven, Michigan, using scion wood that had come from Charles Downing. Years later, in his 1928 book The Garden Lover, he wrote: > I set those scions, and for many a year made pilgrimage to the tree and > opened the green fruits to be surprised again and again at the pink flesh > 'stained with red' as the original The Fruit and Fruit Trees of America has > it. As late as 1957, a single tree was said to be still standing on the site of the Bailey family orchard (which had since been replaced with a hospital). In apple breeding Apple from seedling of the Surprise cultivar, watercolor by Royal Charles Steadman, 1924. Although Surprise turned out to be not well suited to Midwestern and Eastern growing conditions, it did much better when moved to the West Coast, with its long growing season featuring hot days and cool nights. The northern California horticulturist Albert Etter had success with it as the cornerstone of a program to breed pink- and red-fleshed apple cultivars. By 1928, he was far enough along that he published a report in the Pacific Rural Press in which he described two open-pollinated descendants of Surprise that had pink or red flesh. One of these, Redflesh Winter Banana (so named for both its internal and its external appearance) is said to have been his personal favorite among a total of some 30 pink- and red-fleshed varieties that emerged from his breeding program. The second was a nameless variety that, from its description, might have been Pink Pearl, which became by far the best-known of this group and is still grown today. Although not all of Etter's Surprise descendants were successful, the best of them shared a pronounced aromatic quality that appears to be linked to the anthocyanin pigmentation that gives the flesh its distinctive pinkish and reddish tones. Their mixed ancestry meant that their size, skin color, eating qualities, and ripening time varied greatly, as did their flesh color, which ranged from pale pink through rose to purplish red, occasionally mottled or marbled with white. In 1940, Etter set up a partnership with George Roeding Jr.'s California Nursery Company, one of the goals of which was to introduce some of Etter's Surprise-derived cultivars to the public. Eventually Roeding settled on test seedling #39, which apparently impressed him with its looks (translucent skin, medium size, and tapered shape), its tart-sweet flavor, and its late-summer ripening date. He secured U.S. plant patent 723 for it on Etter's behalf, christened it Pink Pearl, and featured it in his 1945 catalog. In 1973, apple fancier Ram Fishman settled near Etter's old experimental orchard and became intrigued by the pink-fleshed apples that could still be found among the old trees on that site. Over the course of a decade, Fishman managed to locate examples of what he believes are about half of Etter's pink-fleshed Surprise descendants. They were given new names since the old names could not be firmly determined and are marketed under the 'Rosetta' series title (alongside other Surprise-based cultivars) through his Greenmantle Nursery. These Etter-Fishman cultivars include Pink Pearmain (probably the same as an apple known elsewhere as Pink Sparkle), Blush Rosette, Thornberry, Rubaiyat, Christmas Pink, Grenadine, and Pink Parfait. Other likely descendants of Surprise have been found elsewhere, such as varieties known as Aerlie's Red Flesh (also known as Airlie Red Flesh and Hidden Rose) and Bill's Red Flesh (also known as Scarlet Surprise), both found in abandoned orchards in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. Surprise continues to be used in apple-breeding programs, and there is particular interest in the potential health benefits of this lineage. The anthocyanins that give red coloration to the skin of red apples and to the flesh of Surprise and its descendants possess antioxidant qualities. One group of scientists has been working since 1989 on breeding red-fleshed apples from Surprise for the Japanese market because most Japanese consumers peel their apples and thus lose the anthocyanins in the skin.

To obtain PRF, required quantity of blood is drawn quickly into test tubes without an anticoagulant and centrifuged immediately. Blood can be centrifuged using a tabletop centrifuge for at least 10 min at 3000 revolution per minute. The resultant product consists of the following three layers; topmost layer consisting of platelet poor plasma, PRF clot in the middle, and red blood cells (RBC) at the bottom. PRF is available as a fibrin clot. PRF clot can be removed from the test tube using a sterile tweezer-like instrument. After lifting, the RBC layer attached to the PRF clot can be carefully removed using a sterilized scissor. Platelet activation in response to tissue damage occurs during the process of making PRF release several biologically active proteins including; platelet alpha granules, platelet‚Äëderived growth factor (PGDF), transforming growth factors‚ÄëŒ≤ (TGF‚ÄëŒ≤), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and epidermal growth factor. Actually, the platelets and leukocyte cytokines play important parts in role of this biomaterial, but the fibrin matrix supporting them is the most helpful in constituting the determining elements responsible for real therapeutic potential of PRF. Cytokines are immediately used and destroyed in a healing wound. The harmony between cytokines and their supporting fibrin matrix has much more importance than any other platelet derivatives. Dentistry =Ridge preservation= Ridge preservation (Colloquially Socket preservation), a procedure to reduce bone loss after tooth extraction to preserve the dental alveolus (containing the tooth socket) in the alveolar bone. A platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) membrane containing bone growth enhancing elements can be stitched over the wound or a graft material or scaffold is placed in the socket of an extracted tooth at the time of extraction. The socket is then directly closed with stitches or covered with a non-resorbable or resorbable membrane and sutured. =Sinus lift= A platelet-rich fibrin can be used if a sinus lift is required for a dental implant. =Periodontal regeneration= Reproduction or reconstitution of a lost or injured part to restore the architecture and function of the periodontium becomes the integral part of comprehensive periodontal therapy. Conventional open flap debridement falls short of regenerating tissues destroyed by the disease. Platelet derived growth factor along with bone morphogenetic proteins are among the most researched growth factors in periodontal regeneration. Platelet rich fibrin showed significant improvement in clinical periodontal parameter as well as in radiograph when compared with open flap debridement alone in a meta analysis. Several bone graft materials have been used in the treatment of infrabony defects. Demineralized freeze dried bone allograft (DFDBA) has been histologically proven to be the material of choice for regeneration. Platelet-rich fibrin has shown significant results comparable to DFDBA for periodontal regeneration. One of the most common aesthetic problem encountered in the field of periodontology is gingival recession, which is, perceived by the patients as increase in length of teeth. Though connective tissue graft is a gold standard procedure, PRF can be used as an alternative procedure by keeping patient's comfort in mind. =Guided bone and tissue regeneration= PRF is used in guided bone and tissue regeneration. =Regenerative endodontics= PRF enhances alveolar bone augmentation and necrotic dental pulp and open tooth apex can be revitalized in regenerative endodontics with platelet-rich fibrin.

Juan Dom√≠nguez de Mendoza: Soldier and Frontiersman of the Spanish Southwest, 1627-1696. The University of New Mexico Press.). Mendoza joined the Spanish Army in his youth.El Cerro de Tom√©, Valencia County, New Mexico. National Park Service. U.S. Department of the Interior. Before 1662, he lived below Isleta Pueblo, New Mexico. When Mendoza arrived in New Mexico, a faction led by him accused and \\"filed grave charges\\" against the governor of the province (at this time New Mexico was a province) Juan Dur√°n de Miranda, which caused a brief imprisonment and the seizure of all his goods. Tom√© Dom√≠nguez de Mendoza was appointed Acting Governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico in 1664. However, his government only lasted until Dur√°n de Miranda (who was released from prison when he presented his arguments about the charges issued against him in Mexico City) recovered his government in the province a year later. In August 1680, Tom√© and his family moved to El Paso del Norte (Ciudad Juarez, in modern Mexico), along with other residents of Rio Abajo, New Mexico. There, he held several positions. One of the positions he occupied was Maeses de Campo \\"with full complement of arms.\\" In 1681, Mendoza, at sixty-one years old, died from gout and a stomach disease.  Personal life  Mendoza married twice: his first marriage was to Catalina L√≥pez Mederos, with whom he had 6 children: Tome III, Antonio, Juana, Francisco (who died in the war against the Puebloans), Juan and Diego (both were injured in the same war) Dom√≠nguez de Mendoza. The second was with Ana Vel√°squez, with whom he had two additional children: Jos√© and Juana Dom√≠nguez. About 1659, Governor Bernardo L√≥pez de Mendiz√°bal gave Mendoza an encomienda to the south of Isleta. When the encomienda passed into his hands, so too did the Native American population who resided there. Mendoza took advantage of this to Christianize them and make them work for him as a way of \\"partial compensation\\" for the debts he owed to the Spanish Crown for several services that the crown provided to him (i.e. protection). In Isleta, the Dominguez family settled to the west of El Cerro de Tom√©, near Tome Hill (next to Rio Grande). However, when the Pueblo Revolt broke out in 1680, thirty-eight members of the Dominguez family were attacked and killed by the Pueblo Native Americans. In addition to his four sons who fought in the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 (among them Tome III), his other two sons, Juan and Diego, were seriously injured due to poisoned arrows. Other family members, such as grandchildren, sons-in-law, brothers and nephews may have also been killed in the war. For the most part, those who survived were forced to leave the place, emigrating south to El Paso del Norte (modern Ciudad Juarez, North of modern Mexico). So, in 1682, Don Pedro de Tom√© y Chaves (brother of the first wife of Mendoza, Catalina L√≥pez Mederos) got permission to migrate to modern-day Mexico with his family and the family of Mendoza. They never returned to New Mexico, even after the Spanish resettlement in New Mexico, which occurred in 1662.

V. Kumar under his banner Thirukumaran Entertainment. The film features Naveen Chandra, Salony Luthra and Aadukalam Naren in leading roles, while Britto Michael as music director. The film opened to positive reviews from critics in August 2014. The movie is loosely based on the 2003 Japanese thriller Game.https://wap.business-standard.com/article-amp/news- ians/southern-cinema-s-uncredited-film-adaptations-114111200512_1.html Plot Vikram (Naveen Chandra) is a young project manager at an architecture firm in Chennai. Though he leads an honest life, he maintains that it is not wrong to do something illegal for money as long as you don't get caught. One day, he goes to his firm's biggest client, Chandrasekar (Aadukalam Naren) to present an ambitious theme park project plan that he had been preparing for months. It is then when Vikram and his colleague see Chandrasekar's rebellious daughter enter the office to demand for money, embarrassing him in front of everyone. Having lost his mood, Chandrasekar coldly rejects Vikram's plan. Vikram gets drunk and then goes to Chandrasekar's beach house to vandalize it. Instead, he sees Chandrasekar's daughter running away. Vikram follows her to a nearby hotel and confronts her about her father's behaviour. She introduces herself as Shruti (Salony Luthra) and reveals that she dislikes her father just as much as Vikram does because he is a materialistic corporate man. Shruti follows Vikram home, where she proposes that he pretend to abduct her in order to extort ransom money from Chandrasekar. Vikram initially refuses. However, he learns from his superior at work the next day that Chandrasekar had a change of heart and has approved his theme park plan in condition that the firm has a more experienced project manager head the project. Vikram becomes ever more furious when his archenemy at the firm is chosen to lead the project and finally agrees to Shruti's plan. Together, Vikram and Shruti easily extort all the black money that Chandrasekar has been hiding away from the income tax department. He then sends Shruti back home safely while promising to keep her share of the money for her while she prepares her passport and visa to run away to Australia. The next day, Vikram learns from the news that a young girl's dead body resembling Chandrasekar's daughter has been found washed up at the beach. As Vikram panics, Chandrasekar and Shruti walk into his apartment. Chandrasekar then reveals that the rebellious daughter Vikram saw the other day at his office was actually Shruti's twin, Sanjana (Salony Luthra). Shruti accidentally killed Sanjana while trying to stop the latter from taking her drugs. That was when she ran away from home and ended up with Vikram. Her father then calls her up and forces her to help him frame Vikram instead. This was why Chandrasekar approved Vikram's plan out of the blue and then had another project manager hired to further provoke him to have revenge. Chandrasekar then takes back his ransom money in return for not having Vikram arrested by the police for Sanjana's so-called kidnapping and murder. Furious that he has been played, Vikram decides to really kidnap Shruti for the money. He sees her leaving her father's beach house and takes her away forcefully. He has Chandrasekar bring his money to a warehouse in exchange for Shruti. At the warehouse, Chandrasekar brings a gang along for protection and Vikram has to fight them off. However, it is revealed that Shruti is actually Sanjana all along, and it was Shruti who was killed during their struggle. Knowing that their father would not support her, she pretended to be Shruti all along and had the real Shruti's body look like her instead. Seeing that her father never loved her and was instead happy she had died, she kills him in cold blood and splits the ransom money with Vikram. Sanjana then continues pretending to be Shruti and explains to the police that it was her own father who kidnapped and killed his drug addict daughter with the help of the gang to save his reputation. The gang then goes into hiding for a crime they did not commit. Meanwhile, Sanjana takes over Chandrasekar's company and hires Vikram as her theme park's project leader.

Stating \\"I want to make Congress work for residents of my hometown and for the entire nation. I want to bring back the vision of our Founding Fathers; to prove that compromise and good governance are actually possible in Washington D.C., your elected representatives should work for you - not special interests, not big money and not high-powered elites. To make sure I can do that - to be free of the chains that bind Congress - I am running as an Independent.\\" David Swartout was the first ever Independent candidate to be certified by the Michigan Election Commission to appear on the 7th Congressional District General Election Ballot. Swartout v. Johnson On July 11, 2014 David Swartout filed a complaint in the United States Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against Ruth Johnson in her official capacity as Secretary of State of Michigan. Swartout challenged a provision of Michigan Election Law which requires that candidates for Congressional office who are Independents have the designation \\"NPA\\" or \\"no party affiliation\\" after their name on the general election ballots, creating ambiguity of their status. Swartout challenged that the inability to have \\"Independent\\" by his name, similar to the majority of American States violated his First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.

A hearing was set for September 24, 2014 at the Federal courthouse in Detroit, Michigan to hear arguments on issuance of a temporary restraining order to require the State of Michigan to reprint general election ballots. Judge Friedman turned down the requested order on the grounds the motion was barred by Laches, to not disrupt the orderly election process, he did not rule on the merits of the case. Judge Friedman further stated that \\"there seemed to be an issue here\\" and that maybe this is an issue \\"that state lawmakers should take up\\" to resolve. On October 1, 2014, Swartout and the Michigan Attorney General's office both agreed to stipulate to a voluntary dismissal of the complaint, to allow the matter to be taken up at a later date by the Michigan State Legislature.

In a 1995 op-ed, Lockman warned of a \\"secret gay affirmative action plan,\\" claiming \\"You can bet the rent money they will demand that employers set up goals and timetables to achieve 10 percent homosexual representation in the workforce and in government contracts.\\" In a 1995 letter in the Sun Journal in Lewiston, a reader quoted a press statement by Lockman, then part of the Pro Life Education Association, saying, ‚ÄúIf a woman has (the right to an abortion), why shouldn‚Äôt a man be free to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman? At least the rapist‚Äôs pursuit of sexual freedom doesn‚Äôt (in most cases) result in anyone‚Äôs death.‚Äù In 2012, Lockman was elected to the House's District 30, which included portions of Hancock and Washington counties, with 2188 votes to 2082 for Democrat Dennis Mahar. He was a strong supporter of Maine's governor Paul LePage, who was challenged for re-election in the 2014 race by Lockman's previous opponent, Michael Michaud (who in 2013 came out as gay) LePage was succeeded by Democrat Janet Mills in 2018.  Response to controversy  Lockman has released a statement saying \\"I have always been passionate about my beliefs, and years ago I said things that I regret. I hold no animosity toward anyone by virtue of their gender or sexual orientation, and today I am focused on ensuring freedom and economic prosperity for all Mainers.\\"  Personal life  In 1990, Lockman was part of a group seeking to break the union at the Passadumkeag Stud Mill where he worked, a drive which was defeated by an 81 to 18 vote. He had worked there for sixteen years before leaving in 1992 to work as a territory manager in eastern Maine for the National Federation of Independent Business, a position he held until 2010. He now works as a territory manager in eastern and central Maine for National Write Your Congressman. Lockman and his wife Debbie were married in 1974. They have four adult children and five grandchildren.

The white structure seen in the upper animal is the protruded penis papilla. The reproductive system of planarians is broadly similar among different families, although the associated structures can vary in complexity. All planarians are hermaphrodites, so their reproductive system has a male and a female part. Both parts communicate with the surface of the body via a single opening called gonopore, which is located on the ventral side of the posterior half of the body.  Male part of the reproductive system  thumb Simplified version of a planarian's reproductive system. thumb The male part of the reproductive system in planarians has a set of several testicles, distributed throughout the body in two or more rows. They are usually concentrated in the anterior two thirds of the body, although they can reach close to the posterior end. The testicles are connected to a pair of sperm ducts which run posteriorly towards the gonopore. In some groups, the sperm ducts met in their distal part, forming the ejaculatory duct, which then opens in a cavity called ‚Äúmale atrium‚Äù. In others, like land planarians, both open in the prostatic vesicle, a glandular organ which then runs posteriorly and opens in the male atrium, usually through an ejaculatory duct. The male atrium is located anteriorly to the gonopore. Usually associated to the ejaculatory duct, there is a structure formed basically by a fold of the walls of the male atrium called ‚Äúpenis papilla‚Äù. The penis papilla is a permanent structure that occupies part or the whole male atrium and is protruded during copulation, thus also called a protrusible penis. In species without a penis papilla, the penis is formed only during copulation by a projection of the walls in the male atrium and called an eversible penis.Ogren, R. E. and Kawakatsu, M. (1990). Index to the species of the family Geoplanidae (Turbellaria, Tricladida, Terricola) Part I: Geoplaninae. Bulletin of Fujis Women's College. 29: 79-166. In land planarians, the structure of the male atrium may be quite variable between different genera. The most common constructions are: *Permanent or true penis papilla: A big penis-like fold occupies the whole male atrium or most of it and is crossed by an ejaculatory duct. It is found in the genera Geoplana, Obama, Cratera, Paraba, Polycladus, Microplana, among others. *Apparent penis papilla: Similar to a true penis papilla, but with a wide ejaculatory cavity instead of an ejaculatory duct. It is found in the genus Matuxia. *Intra- antral penis papilla: A much smaller version of the true penis papilla, perceived as a small conical structure in the male atrium, which is mostly occupyed by irregular folds. It is found in the genera Amaga and Endeavouria, among others. *Inverted penis: A structure that fills most of the male atrium, leaving a narrow canal connecting to the prostatic vesicle that resembles an ejaculatory duct. This canal, however, is pushed outwards during copulation, becoming the outer wall of the penis. It is found in the species Choeradoplana minima. *Absent penis papilla: The male atrium lacks a permanent penis-like structure, i.e., contains an eversible penis, and is usually filled by irregular folds. An ejaculatory duct may be present (as in Pasipha, Imbira and Luteostriata) or not (as in Notogynaphallia).  Female part of the reproductive system  The female part of the reproductive system in planarians is formed by two ovaries in the anterior region. Exiting the ovaries, a pair of oviducts (or, more precisely, ovovitelloducts) runs posteriorly towards the gonopore. A group of yolk glands also connects to these ducts, as planarians are neoophorans and thus yolk is not located inside the eggs. Close to the gonopore, the ovovitelloducts reach a cavity called ‚Äúfemale atrium‚Äù, which is located posteriorly to the gonopore. The ovovitelloducts may or not meet and become a single duct (common ovovitelloduct) before entering the female atrium. The distal part of the ovovitelloducts is usually sorrrounded by shell glands, which secrete the material that forms the shell of the eggcase (also called cocoon).  Accessory structures  Reproductive system of Girardia tigrina. The large pouch-like structure on the left is the bursa copulatrix. Among the accessory structures of the reproductive system of planarians, one usually found in freshwater and marine species is the bursa copulatrix, which has the function to store sperm after mating.Kaburaki, T. (1922). One some Japanese Tricladida Maricola, with a Note on the Classification of the Group. Journal of the College of Science, Tokyo Imperial University. 54: 1-54. Some planarians (such as the genera Planaria, Artioposthia, Arthurdendyus, Coleocephalus and Newzealandia) have a series of finger-like projections, called adenodactyls, near the male and female atria. Adenodactyls contain glands and produce several secretions believed to be useful during reproduction.Graff, L. v. (1896). √úber die Morphologie des Geschlechtesapparates der Landplanarien.

It is found in shallow coral reefs that are exposed to the action of strong waves, at depths up to 15 m. It is vulnerable to coral bleaching, disease and crown-of-thorns starfish. It is resistant to predation as it has well-developed radial corallite lips. Taxonomy and systematics Acropora abrotanoides was first described by Lamarck in 1816 as Madrepora abrotanoides. Acropora irregularis was formerly considered as a separate species, but is now considered as synonymous with Acropora abrotanoides. Description It occurs in colonies of fused branches growing across the seabed (prostrate) with vertical outer branches with diameters of up to ; these can be table-shaped. In the centre of a colony, the branches are fused together‚Äîthese can be either elongated or conical, sometimes with ends tapering to a point. Its branches contain both axial and radial corallites; radial corallites have been observed as elongated and axial corallites occur in varying numbers and are rasp-like or tubular in shape. Radial corallites have evolved to have well-developed tips preventing predation. It is green-grey or pink-brown in colour and is similar to Acropora pinguis, and Acropora robusta. Distribution Acropora abrotanoides is found from the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, through the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and the East China Sea, Australia, and Japan. It also occurs in the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean. Threats It is classed as a least concern species on the IUCN Red List, but it is believed that its population is decreasing, and it is listed under Appendix II of CITES. Figures of its population are unknown, but is likely to be threatened by the global reduction of coral reefs, the increase of temperature causing coral bleaching, climate change, human activity, the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) and disease.

It is also present in the western Pacific Ocean. It is an uncommon species and is particularly prone to coral bleaching, disease, and crown-of- thorns starfish predation; it is also harvested for use in aquaria, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as being a \\"vulnerable species\\". Habitat loss is a big concern. Description Acropora aculeus forms corymbose, pillow-like structures, the horizontal branches being slender and spreading while the upright branches are narrow and shorter. The corallites are distinctive, longer than they are wide, smooth and polished. This coral is usually yellowish or grey, but can be bright bluish-green, and the tips of the branches are often yellow, pale blue, green or brown. It is usually yellow on the Great Barrier Reef and in the Philippines, but pale brown in western Australia. It is named as ACR ACUL in Coral Codes. Distribution and habitat Acropora aculeus is native to the Indo-Pacific region, its range extending from the east coast of Africa and Madagascar to Taiwan, Japan, Indonesia, Australia and some island groups in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It is endemic to the Philippines distributed in Samoa, Great Barrier Reef, Sri Lanka, South Vietnam, and the Marshall Islands. It occurs at depths between about or even deeper. It is found on all parts of the reef, particularly the front slope, and also in lagoons. Its form varies with its degree of exposure to wave action, being more massive in exposed locations and more pillow-like in lagoons. Status The reefs on which Acropora aculeus lives are under threat from global warming, increased ocean acidification and reef destruction. It is a generally uncommon species of coral and is particularly susceptible to bleaching and coral diseases. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being \\"vulnerable\\", considering that 37% of the colonies may be lost in the next thirty years (three generation lengths). Others suggest it is endangered, along with 76% of the Acropora corals.

It is found on shallow coral reefs from depths of 5‚Äì20 m. It was described by Verrill in 1864. Description It is found in table-shaped colonies mainly consisting of horizontal branches, which taper to points. Corallites are not visible on the horizontal branches of specimens and form parts of the branches, while corallites on vertical branches exist in two forms, including a large tube- shaped form. It is brown or pale blue in colour and appears similar to Acropora hoeksemai. Radial corallites have nariform or oval openings and generally do not come in contact with each other. Distribution It is classed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List as the population is decreasing, and is listed under Appendix II of CITES.

Philippide (; May 1, 1859 ‚Äì August 12, 1933) was a Romanian linguist and philologist. Educated in Ia»ôi and Halle, he taught high school for several years until 1893, when he secured a professorship at the University of Ia»ôi that he would hold until his death forty years later. He began publishing books on the Romanian language around the time he graduated from university, but it was not until he became a professor that he drew wider attention, thanks to a study of the language's history. Although not particularly ideological, he penned sharp, witty polemics directed at various intellectual figures, both at home and, in one noted case, in Germany. In 1898, Philippide began work on a Romanian dictionary; by 1906, he and his team had completed the first four letters of the alphabet before others took over the task. His major work, which appeared in two hefty volumes in 1925 and 1928, brings together a wide range of ancient sources and linguistic evidence to analyze the ethnogenesis of the Romanians and the development of their language. Although attacked for parochialism by one set of academics, the students he trained carried forth his ideas by forming the core of an Ia»ôi- based linguistic school. Biography =Origins and early career= Born in B√¢rlad in the Tutova County of Western Moldavia region,Arvinte, p. 13 his father Iancu was deputy prefect of a plasƒÉ during the reign of Alexandru Ion Cuza, and owned land at Cer»õe»ôti, a village to the south.RƒÉdulescu, p. 88 Philippide was of Greek origin on his father's side, the family originating in Milies, a village at the foot of Mount Pelion in Thessaly. His great- grandfather's brother Daniel Philippidis, a historian and geographer, settled in Ia»ôi at the turn of the 19th century. Gabriela Ursachi, \\"Aprilie\\" , Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, nr.16/2005 His family origins were a source of pride, even in old age: asked by Nicolae BƒÉnescu if he was of Aromanian background, the linguist replied, \\"no, no, we're entirely Greek!\\"»òova, p. 65 Alexandru attended primary school (1866‚Äì1870) and Gheorghe Ro»ôca Codreanu High School (1870‚Äì1877), both in his native city. \\"Un who's who b√¢rlƒÉdean\\" , pp. 8‚Äì9, at the B√¢rlad City Hall site Subsequently, he enrolled in the University of Ia»ôi, earning his degree in 1881. Pursuing specialized study at the University of Halle- Wittenberg from 1888 to 1890, he took courses in classical and modern philology, archaeology and the history of Greek philosophy. \\"Alexandru Philippide\\" at the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University site While there, he met Eduard Sievers, Heinrich Keil and Hermann Suchier, becoming close friends with the latter.»òova, p. 66 A librarian at the Central University Library of Ia»ôi from 1881 to 1884, he subsequently taught at the city's National College. He was hired there to fill a vacancy caused by the death of an admired teacher, Alexandru Lambrior.»òova, pp. 65‚Äì66 Returning to teach high school after his German stint, he became a professor at the literature faculty in Ia»ôi in 1893, retaining the post until his death.Arvinte, p. 13; Boia, p. 278 He was initially a substitute professor in the newly created department, rising to full professor in 1896. A Neogrammarian, he taught courses on the history of the Romanian language, general linguistics, Vulgar Latin, the physiology of the human voice and the origin of the Romanians.Arvinte, p. 13; Pamfil 2008, p. 212 The initiator of an original theory of linguistics, this was developed and augmented by his student Gheorghe IvƒÉnescu.Arvinte, pp. 13‚Äì14 His books, studies and articles total some 4000 pages, while his course materials number another 1500.Pamfil 1992, p. 297 The latter, in which he traced the history of the Romanian language, complemented his published work. It was where he tested new ideas and drafted outlines for the full-length Originea rom√¢nilor.Pamfil 2008, pp. 211-212 =1880s‚Äì1890s writings= An early work was the 1881 √éncercare asupra stƒÉrii sociale a poporului rom√¢nesc √Æn trecut (\\"Investigation into the Social Status of the Romanian People in the Past\\"), which attempted to trace the origins of Romanian culture. In 1892, he undertook a thorough linguistic analysis to demonstrate that the Chronicle of Huru, a purported 13th-century document, was in fact a modern forgery.Pavel, pp. 31‚Äì32 He published (\\"Introduction to the History of Romanian Language and Literature\\") in 1888 and GramaticƒÉ elementarƒÉ a limbii rom√¢ne (\\"Elementary Grammar of the Romanian Language\\") in 1897; this was at a time when domestic scientifically composed textbooks were in scarce supply. The first work, after presenting the author's ideas on literary history, goes on to provide biographical sketches of Romanian literary figures from the 16th-century Coresi through 1821. Philippide believed that a satisfactory history of Romanian literature did not exist, and set out to correct this deficiency.Ichim, pp. 58‚Äì59 Beginning here,Dragomir, p. 19 he grappled with the issue of the literary language, which he termed the \\"common language\\". Observing that Romanian had not yet developed a firm standard, he both suggested a theory of language evolution and steps to be taken toward standardization.Dragomir, p. 17 However, he rejected wholesale attempts to create a new variant, which he accused Heimann Hariton Tiktin of doing prematurely.Dragomir, pp. 19‚Äì20 He ascribed overarching importance in the creation and evolution of literary languages to popular writers. The second work, targeted at a specialist audience,Br√¢ncu»ô, p. 25 was not intended as a textbook but as a means to show Romanian grammar as it existed in reality; this was in contrast with Tiktin's 1891 teaching manual. Philippide discussed words selected from the dictionary by Alexandru Cihac, the only one he found respectable; and from writers, Moldavians especially: Ion CreangƒÉ foremost, but also Mihai Eminescu, Alexandru Odobescu, Costache Negruzzi, Petre Ispirescu, Costache Conachi and Vasile Alecsandri; and from the Moldavian chronicles, as well as a bit of Anton Pann. The book features many examples of the spoken language, some of them in the Moldavian subdialect. He believed the examples would help illustrate the development of the language's inflection and syntax;Br√¢ncu»ô, p. 19 this methodology is unique in the annals of Romanian grammar works. Here, he introduced the (debated) notion that the Romanian literary language was not based on a particular subdialect, but resulted from each one's contributions. While the Wallachian form was previously dominant, the increasing output of Moldavian writers meant that, by the end of the 19th century, the written language had become a compromise between the two.Pavel, pp. 38‚Äì39 It was an 1894 history of the language that put him on the academic map. Although modeled on Hermann Paul's Principles of the History of Language, it was original in scope, discussing the distinction between literary and spoken language, the causes of linguistic change, the processes that lead to literary language formation and the relation between language and orthography. In his writing, he insisted on phonetic spelling, a principle that arose not only out of his linguistic theory, but also from his study of anthropology, which led him to believe that \\"naturalness\\" should lie at the heart of language, as well as morality, society and art.Patra»ô, p. 84 However, he made one significant exception to the phonetic rule: his own surname. When asked on this point, he joked that he wished to show he had the same name as Alexander the Great, \\"who was himself Alexandru Philippide, that is, Alexander, son of Philip.\\" =Family life= Philippide married twice. As a bachelor, he sought a German bride, having become convinced during his Halle days that a German woman would be ideal for him.NastasƒÉ, p. 63 His first wife, Johanna Minckwitz, had a doctorate in Romance philology and was the daughter of a Z√ºrich professor. The marriage took place in a civil ceremony at Saint Helier on Jersey in early October 1895.NastasƒÉ, pp. 63, 87 Although initially delighted with his new wife, the relationship soured due to the presence of Philippide's mother-in-law in his house. During one heated argument, he handled an axe and Johanna took her mother's side. Eventually, the two women returned to Switzerland and the marriage ended in divorce. Johanna continued to be interested in Romanian literature, and put out her own study of Eminescu's poetry.BƒÉdarƒÉ, p. 47 She and Philippide reportedly had a child, although details have not survived.NastasƒÉ, p. 71 In 1897, Philippide married a Romanian woman.NastasƒÉ, p. 90 This was Lucre»õia Nem»õeanu, a young novice at Agapia Monastery, where her sister was a nun. Her father, the former mayor of V√¢nƒÉtori-Neam»õ, was the administrator of the mental hospital in T√¢rgu Neam»õ.Dinu Pillat, Itinerarii istorico-literare, p. 261. Editura Minerva, 1978NastasƒÉ, p. 102 He first learned of Lucre»õia when he saw her photograph in the hands of her brother, a student of his, and asked to meet her; a month and a half later, the two were married. This time, both a civil and a religious (Romanian Orthodox) service were held, probably at the insistence of his new in-laws.NastasƒÉ, p. 87 Although remarking on her \\"rotten poverty\\", he admired Lucre»õia's youth, beauty and kindness, considering her the opposite of Johanna. Their son, born in 1900, was the future poet Alexandru A. Philippide. The latter would recall the Spartan education received from his father, involving a strict program of Homeric verse in the original Greek. The elder Philippide drew a sharp distinction between science, which he regarded as the province of manly, knowledge-seeking personalities; and literature, particularly poetry, which for him was an unserious activity for sensitive small minds. Although he had flirted with poetry as a young man, he was saddened to see his son adopt it as a profession.Patra»ô, p. 80 =Junimea and philosophical orientation= Philippide entered Junimea society in the early 1890s, during its gradual relocation to Bucharest, the national capital. He then remained in contact with the young intellectuals who still met in Ia»ôi, where Junimea maintained a nominal presence‚Äîwith N. Volenti and Teohari Antonescu as mainstays. Philippide was disgusted by the provincial airs of Ia»ôi Junimism. In December 1898, he wrote a letter to Junimea founder Titu Maiorescu, telling him that his creation had \\"degenerated\\" beyond recognition: \\"joke has turned to buffoonery, sally to insanity, liberty to anarchy.\\"Ornea I, p. 100 His time at Junimea did not leave a significant impact on his thinking: it was for him primarily a means of access to high society and developing useful connections with prominent figures capable of helping him advance. Later, once he was secure in his professorship, he distanced himself from Junimism, particularly its political manifestation.Patra»ô, p. 83 Philippide did retain something of the conservative aesthetics promoted by Maiorescu, with which his tastes and sensibilities naturally fit in. Like Maiorescu himself, he derided didacticism, \\"social ideals\\" in art, and the Marxist school of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. He detailed this hostility in his essay Idealuri (\\"Ideals\\"), serialized by the Junimea magazine, Convorbiri Literare, in 1892 and 1893: Philippide thought it absurd that Dobrogeanu-Gherea equated cultural heritage with socialist culture, and was infuriated by the Marxist claim that Junimea would not survive at all in cultural memory.Ornea II, pp. 74, 332‚Äì333, 339, 340‚Äì343, 345, 357 Writing from a Junimist standpoint, he opined that a writer must take literary tradition into account, and that his writing should be devoid of moralizing.Pavel, p. 39 According to literary historian Z. Ornea, Idealuri is \\"dense, confused, and rather outside the scope of the polemic\\", as well as \\"passionately violent\\" in tone.Ornea II, pp. 341‚Äì342 From 1900, Philippide joined the 26-man team of editors at Convorbiri Literare (a step in its ongoing transition from literary polemics to scientific publishing).Ornea I, pp. 118‚Äì120 In 1902, at Constantin Stere's urging, Philippide joined the anti-Junimist National Liberal Party, but retained amiable or even friendly ties to Junimea figures, particularly Maiorescu.Patra»ô, p. 83 In line with the latter's pronouncements, he was a critic of modern, bourgeois-created Romanian society. Although nearly as vehement in this regard as Eminescu, he approached the matter not from a political angle but based on the classical morality espoused in the Nicomachean Ethics. An independent thinker and committed individualist, characterized by moral intransigence, a lucid critic of his era and of his country's negative aspects, Philippide refused to be pigeonholed into a single ideological current, thus occupying a rare position for the time. His original thought combined tendencies normally thought of as contradictory: to his Junimist foundations were added small portions of socialist-tinted humanitarianism and SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist-Poporanist nationalism, as well as a hefty dose of German notions. Nevertheless, in the view of literary critic Antonio Patra»ô, they managed to form a coherent and compelling whole, lending scientific but also moral authority to his writings.Patra»ô, p. 81 =Dictionary project= Elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1898 and upgraded to titular member in 1900,Arvite, p. 13; BƒÉdarƒÉ, pp. 48, 50 he took part in its sessions twice, in 1910 and 1918. Philippide pursued two major tasks: the composition of a Romanian dictionary and the writing of the language's history from its origins to his day. Between 1898 and 1906, under the Academy's aegis, he worked on Dic»õionarul limbii rom√¢ne (\\"Dictionary of the Romanian Language\\"), together with several students. The project was sponsored by Maiorescu, who, like Philippide, deplored the excessive tendency to ascribe Latin etymologies. He managed to write definitions for letters A through D before having to interrupt his work; the manuscript covers 11,744 folio pages. He put together a bibliography and plan for the whole dictionary and collected over 600,000 files.Arvinte, p. 14; Pamfil 1992, p. 299; Patra»ô, pp. 86‚Äì87Sextil Pu»ôcariu, Limba rom√¢nƒÉ: Privire generalƒÉ, p. x. Editura Minerva, 1976 Inherited from Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, who offered to pass him notes,BƒÉdarƒÉ, p. 50 the project subsequently passed into the hands of Sextil Pu»ôcariu. The proximate cause for the end of Philippide's involvement was that the contract had expired; however, disagreements had arisen over the years as well. The Academy and King Carol wanted a normal, functional, barebones dictionary, while Philippide preferred an exhaustive compilation of the lexis, \\"a Littr√© for the Romanians\\"Patra»ô, pp. 86‚Äì87 (although he eventually dropped entries on proper nouns).BƒÉdarƒÉ, pp. 49‚Äì50 One of his collaborators on the project was Garabet IbrƒÉileanu, whom he had helped set up Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ. The two shared a conservative temperament but not a similar political outlook, and Philippide took aim at the other's purported deficiencies as a philologist, seeing him as primarily a philosopher.Patra»ô, pp. 83, 84, 87 =Renewed public debates= Philippide's house in Ia»ôi Alongside Stere, Philippide was a founding member and mentor of Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ magazine, which, according to his own linguistic norms, was written in conscious contrast to the official spelling directives from the Academy. In his essays, which appeared in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ and in Convorbiri Literare, Philippide tried to create a model portrait of the Romanian intellectual. His writings were polemical, sharply attacking the leading figures of his time. He derided a certain type of \\"specialist\\", and insisted that intellectuals needed to focus above all on enrichment through learning.Pamfil 1992, p. 299 His intellectual models had both made their mark prior to Alexandru Ioan Cuza's being deposed in 1866: Timotei Cipariu and Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu. Considering he lived in a darker age, the only later scholar he admired was Lambrior, while the quintessential \\"specialist\\" for him was Hasdeu.»òova, p. 67 Uninterested in adopting others' opinions, with a penchant for discipline and thoroughness acquired in Germany, he became an adept of Stoicism, which accounts for his emphasis on ethical values, above all honesty. His devotion to honesty sometimes caused problems in social settings.BƒÉdarƒÉ, p. 49; Patra»ô, pp. 79‚Äì80 Analyzing his style, particularly as found in his correspondence, philologist Cristina Florescu categorizes Philippide as a late Romantic, displaying \\"impetuosity, idealism, a longing for a vanished time, imprudent and abrupt gestures\\", his flourishes meshing with his \\"elevated consciousness of Romanian realities\\".Florescu, pp. 44‚Äì45 She suggests that his spirit, in order to face a society he often shunned, took refuge in humor.Florescu, p. 50 His primary weapon was irony: \\"whether acidic or gently sentimental, frequently hilarious but even more often stinging\\". His blend of satire, humor and irony made for a highly specific writing style.Florescu, p. 48 However, as argued by his friend Gheorghe T. Kirileanu, his speeches were uplifting, \\"stirring up inside you, in the deepest parts of your soul, the pleasure to work and live.\\"BƒÉdarƒÉ, p. 48 According to Kirileanu, Philippide was cheerful only \\"because he wants to make others happy\\"; his scatological jokes, however, were perfectly suited to annoy \\"the delicate aristocrats\\", Simion Mehedin»õi and Matei B. Cantacuzino.BƒÉdarƒÉ, p. 49 Collections of his essays appeared as Specialistul rom√¢n. Contribu»õie la istoria culturii rom√¢ne»ôti din secolul XIX (\\"The Romanian Specialist. Contribution to the History of Romanian Culture in the 20th Century\\", 1906‚Äì1907), and as (\\"How the Romanian Specialist Defends Himself\\", 1908). However, he also attacked German linguist Gustav Weigand in a series of articles that appeared in 1909‚Äì1910 in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, published in 1910 in a single volume as Un specialist rom√¢n la Lipsca (\\"A Romanian Specialist at Leipzig\\"). He began by defending his student Giorge Pascu, the target of a number of attacks by Weigand. Broadening the scope of his polemic, he questioned Weigand's competence as a scholar of Romanian, as well as that of other contemporary linguists. He passionately underscored what he considered Weigand's shortcomings as a person, accusing him of lacking objectivity and even of intrigue, claiming he sent letters to magazines in order to stop publication of articles by professional rivals.DumistrƒÉcel, p. 28 Philippide made a trip to Western Europe in 1914, after which he remained in Ia»ôi for the rest of his days. Like many educated Moldavians, he expressed distaste for Bucharest, considering it the root of all evil. He derided the Romanian Parliament as a gathering of \\"wretched undertakers\\", and railed against the Romanian Academy, which he saw as a hastily improvised imitation of prestigious Western academies, rife with imposture and improvisation, its members concerned with getting rich quickly rather than finding comfort in the rewards of philosophy.Patra»ô, p. 82 Philippide, in common with other Junimists, deplored the French influence on Romania, believing the country needed a Germanic touch for its betterment. He was proud to live far from the hustle and bustle of Bucharest, hoping to revive the Junimea-era glories of the country's former cultural capital that he inhabited. To this end, he helped bring a superior class of students, professors, writers and artists to Ia»ôi. Philippide, together with many other Junimists and Ia»ôi academics such as Stere, favored the Central Powers for the first two years of World War I, during which interval Romania remained neutral.Boia, pp. 109, 111 His cooperation with Stere deepened: in early 1916, he supported Stere's bid to return as Rector of Ia»ôi University, and ran on the same list as him. Although Philippide gathered most votes, the list overall lost as a result of government opposition and intrigue.Boia, pp. 119‚Äì120, 243, 278‚Äì279, 314‚Äì315 The \\"Germanophile\\" party lost, as, in 1916, Romania joined the Entente; after the German counteroffensive, Bucharest was occupied and Ia»ôi became the provisional capital of a rump Romanian state. Between October 1916 and spring 1919, Ia»ôi University virtually ceased functioning due to the hardships of war. Its buildings were requisitioned by the War Ministry and most of the faculty were not in town. However, a few professors, including Philippide as well as IbrƒÉileanu and Dimitrie Gusti, were able to teach part of their course schedule inside their private homes, which were not entirely taken over by the army.Ovidiu BuruianƒÉ, \\"Partidul Na»õional-Liberal √Æn alegerile parlamentare din anul 1928\\", in Analele »ôtiin»õifice ale UniversitƒÉ»õii \\"Al. I. Cuza\\" din Ia»ôi: Istorie, vol.LI/2005, p. 276 In October 1918, after Romania made peace with Germany, Philippide proposed Stere, IbrƒÉileanu, and Ilie BƒÉrbulescu for membership of the Academy‚Äîthey lost, owing to Stere's uncompromising Germanophilia.Boia, pp. 111, 278‚Äì279, 357 =Originea rom√¢nilor= The first volume of Originea rom√¢nilor He spent the better part of his career on his second principal endeavor, a history of the language and an exploration of how it arose. Called Originea rom√¢nilor (\\"The Origin of the Romanians\\"), its first, 889-page volume appeared in 1925, with the second 829-page one being published in 1928.Pamfil 1992, p. 297; Pamfil 2008, p. 211 Volume I, Ce spun izvoarele istorice (\\"What Historical Sources Say\\"), deals with the Romanians' ethnogenesis (see origin of the Romanians) and displays Philippide's abilities as an historian. He brings critical analysis to the works of Herodotus, Polybius, Appian, Strabo, Ptolemy and Cassius Dio, focusing on their writings about Dacia and the northern Balkans. The work includes long passages that had never previously appeared in Romanian. At the same time, he details the Latin inscriptions found in the Balkans, paying close attention to Procopius' De aedificiis but also to other material in the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum. He calculates the length and intensity of Romanization in various parts of the Balkans and documents the ethnic migrations that took place throughout the Middle Ages between the north and south banks of the Danube. Additionally, he summarizes and critiques the main theories of ethnogenesis that appeared between the Middle Ages and the beginning of the 20th century.Arvinte, p. 14 He completely rejects the notion put forth by Austrian historian Robert Roesler that Romance-speaking people migrated into Transylvania in the 12th‚Äì13th centuries, after Magyar settlement, instead proposing a migration north of the Danube starting in the 6th century.Pamfil 1992, p. 298 He made a correction to the Jireƒçek Line that was generally accepted by later linguists.Pamfil 1992, pp. 297‚Äì298 Part I of volume II is called Ce spune limba rom√¢nƒÉ (\\"What the Romanian Language Says\\"), and details the history of the language's phonology. Remaining a standard reference text into the 21st century, the book also includes a history of the Aromanian language's grammar. Using the comparative historical method of the Indo-Europeanists, he reconstructs the language at its beginnings, labeling it \\"primitive Romanian\\" (see Proto-Romanian language), a dialect of Vulgar Latin. He suggests how the Eastern Romance languages were related at that point and how they broke apart into four distinct entities: Daco-Romanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian and Istro-Romanian. He used Weigand's linguistic atlas of the area, as well as many other sources on the four languages.Arvinte, pp. 14‚Äì15 The evolution of each sound and each grammatical form in the languages is closely documented. In the second part of volume II, Ce spune limba albanezƒÉ (\\"What the Albanian Language Says\\"), he tackles the difficult question of how Romanian is related to Albanian and how this might shed light on Romanians' ethnogenesis. His conclusions retain general acceptance: that commonalities between the two languages are not due to borrowing by the ancestors of the Romanians from early Albanian, or vice versa, but arise from an ancient substrate. For Romanian, this is a pre-Roman, Thracian-Dacian-Moesian one; while for Albanian, the substrate is the Illyrian-Pannonian language.Arvinte, p. 15 In terms of where ethnogenesis took place, Philippide, based on historic and linguistic investigation, proposed that this happened after 268 AD in the Roman provinces south of the Danube: Pannonia Inferior, Moesia (Superior and Inferior) and Dardania, and not in Dacia Traiana. Later research using discoveries in archaeology and numismatics that had not yet been made in Philippide's day cast doubt on his hypothesis that the Roman population of Dacia withdrew south of the Danube during the reign of Emperor Gallienus. The linguistic portion of his hypothesis dealt with affrication, and he based his conclusions on the chronology of this phenomenon that was accepted in his time. Since then, a new timeline has come to be accepted.Arvinte, pp. 15‚Äì16 Nevertheless, Philippide was not strident in his conclusions, suggesting that a Romanized remnant stayed in Dacia even after 268, while in the parts of Romania that were not under Roman rule, there were people \\"not Romanized, but only Romanianized, and who live there, where they are now, since time immemorial\\".Arvinte, p. 16 =Later life and legacy= Philippide suffered an attack of paralysis in early 1926 and developed atherosclerosis in 1931. This became worse upon his wife's death in March 1933 and led to his own death five months later. Nevertheless, although he reached the mandatory retirement age in 1929, he received three successive exemptions that allowed him to remain on the faculty until his death. Iorgu Iordan, \\"Alexandru Philippide\\", in Anuarul UniversitƒÉ»õii MihƒÉilene din Ia»ôi, 1930‚Äì1935, p. 109. Editura UniversitƒÉ»õii MihƒÉilene, Ia»ôi, 1936 In 1927, an Institute of Romanian Philology was set up alongside Ia»ôi University upon the initiative of Philippide and Pascu, its first director. In December 1933, four months after his death, it was named in Philippide's honor. Repere istorice at the Institutul de Filologie Rom√¢nƒÉ \\"A. Philippide\\" site During his lifetime, only Pu»ôcariu was an intellectual rival of equal stature. Later, for years, and for mainly ideological reasons although using his work as a pretext, he was ascribed an image of provincialism and extravagance bearing unjustified pretensions. The south- Danubian ethnogenesis hypothesis proposed in Originea rom√¢nilor provoked long- term fury among a wide variety of uncultured nationalists, while philologists who had their own ethnic-based prejudices summarily dismissed Philippide's view. Moreover, his personal character did not help matters, with contemporaries recalling him as withdrawn, overly proud, unpredictable, cold when not aggressive during unwanted encounters. It was only in the presence of close associates or before the classroom that he let down his guard. Feared and respected by allies as well as rivals, only a relatively few followers understood and valued him.Patra»ô, p. 79 Nevertheless, these latter scholars did make use of his publications as a basis for their own research, as well as adopting the rigorous intellectual methods and persistent search for knowledge that he displayed.Gafton, p. 54 His students include the main representatives of the Ia»ôi school of linguistics: Gheorghe GhibƒÉnescu, Vasile Bogrea, Giorge Pascu, Iorgu Iordan, Constantin GƒÉlu»ôcƒÉ, Titus Hotnog, I. N. Popovici, Ioan »òiadbei, Dimitrie GƒÉzdaru, Grigore Scorpan, Haralambie MihƒÉescu and Gheorghe IvƒÉnescu. Pascu, IbrƒÉileanu and Iordan took up his ideas on literary language, but it was IvƒÉnescu who subjected them to a detailed critical analysis and developed his own theory by synthesizing Philippide's with linguistic idealism.Dragomir, p. 24 Ion Petrovici's opening speech to the Romanian Academy in 1935 had Philippide as its theme. During the Communist period, Iordan published a biography in 1969. The latter, who retained a strong admiration for his mentor, wrote the book in response to a biography of Hasdeu published the previous year.Sala, p. 27 Next came by a volume of studies that appeared in 1983 on the occasion of the semicentennial of his death, by a volume of his works the following year, and by a 1986 book recording dialogues with his contemporaries. Carmen-Gabriela Pamfil authored a 2008 biography in preparation for the 150th anniversary of Philippide's birth.DumistrƒÉcel, pp. 27‚Äì28 In 2011, his edited course materials were published as Istoria limbii rom√¢ne (\\"The History of the Romanian Language\\").Vieru, p. 75 Two Ia»ôi sites associated with Philippide are listed as historic monuments by Romania's Culture Ministry: his house, now a laboratory used by the city's medical university; and his grave in Eternitatea cemetery.

He was the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs from 2014 to 2015 and the governor of Salah ad-Din governorate from 2013 to 2014. Political career Jubouri was the Salah ad-Din governor's Assistant for Security Affairs from 2005. In the 2009 governorate elections he stood for the Iraqi National List and received more votes than any other candidate. In a deal between the INL and the Iraqi Accord Front, Jubouri was appointed the provincial chairman. Jubouri had a bitter political rivalry with ex-Deputy Governor Abdullah Hussein Jebara. As part of this rivalry Jubouri played a role in the attempts to prevent Jebara from standing for election on de- Ba'athification grounds. =Governorship= Jubouri's political party, the Iraqi People‚Äôs Coalition, received the largest share of the votes in the 2013 Saladin governorate election. Jubouri subsequently became the governor of Saladin governorate. Jubouri survived an assassination attempt on 18 December 2012. Jubouri had been travelling in the Tikrit area in a car with Qotaiba Jubouri, an MP and the Head of Iraqiya Hurra coalition, as part of an inspection of the various districts and villages of Saladin province. When travelling near the village of Albo-Ajeil village a car bomb went off. Both men survived. In December 2013 Juburi was suspended by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki for at least two months while allegations of corruption were investigated.Maliki Suspends Saladin Governor on Corruption Allegations,Rudaw, 27 November 2013  National politics  In the April 2014 elections, he headed the Al-Arabiya Coalition list in Salah ad-Din, which won the highest number of votes in the province. In August 2014 he took a seat in the Council of Representatives of Iraq and resigned as governor. He was appointed Minister of State for Provincial Affairs, a post in the cabinet of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, on 8 September 2014. In August 2015, in response to protests against government corruption and inefficiency, the Prime Minister abolished 11 cabinet posts, including the Ministry for Provincial Affairs. After his removal it was revealed that the Integrity Commission had issued a travel ban against him; he had been twice convicted of car theft, in 1985 and 1992 (which should have made him ineligible as an MP), and the qualification he had declared from a religious institution in Salah ad-Din was not equivalent to a university degree, and therefore he was not eligible to be a minister.

Schrems is the founder of NOYB ‚Äì European Center for Digital Rights.  Complaints with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner 2011  While studying law during a semester abroad at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley, Schrems decided to write his term paper on Facebook's lack of awareness of European privacy law, after being surprised by what the company's privacy lawyer, Ed Palmieri, said to his class on the subject. He later made a request under the European Right of access to personal data provision for the company's records on him and received a CD containing over 1,200 pages of data, which he published at europe-v- facebook.org with personal information redacted. He filed a first round of complaints against the company with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) in 2011. In February 2012 Richard Allan and another company executive flew to Vienna to debate these complaints with him that lasted six hours. Facebook was audited under European law and had to delete some files and disable its facial recognition software. In 2014 Schrems took back the complaints, claiming that he never received a fair procedure before the Irish Data Protection Commissioner. He has never received a formal decision by the DPC and was denied access to all submissions by Facebook and the files of the case. On europe-v-facebook.org, he commented about taking back his complaints: :This decision was based on the fact that the Irish DPC has refused a formal decision for years and has not even granted the most basic procedural rights (access to files, evidence or the counterarguments). The DPC has factually stopped all forms of communication and ignored all submissions made. Many observers assumed that this may be based on political and economic considerations in Ireland.\\"  Schrems I  Max Schrems, 19 February 2012 In 2013 Schrems filed a complaint against Facebook Ireland Ltd with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, Ireland being the country where Facebook has its European Headquarters. The complaint was aimed at prohibiting Facebook to further transfer data from Ireland to the United States, given the alleged involvement of Facebook USA in the PRISM mass surveillance program. Schrems based his complaint on EU data protection law, which does not allow data transfers to non-EU countries, unless there a company can guarantee \\"adequate protection\\". The DPC rejected the complaint, saying that it was \\"frivolous and vexatious\\" and that there was no case to answer. Schrems filed an application for judicial review in the Irish High Court over the inaction by the Irish DPC, which was granted. On 18 June 2014, Mr. Justice Hogan adjourned the case pending a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). He said that Irish law relating to privacy had effectively been pre-empted by European law and that the core issue was whether the relevant directives should be re-evaluated in the light of the subsequent entry into force of Article 8 (protection of personal data) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The European Commission found in the executive decision 2000/520/EC that the so-called EU‚ÄìUS Safe Harbor Principles would provide \\"adequate protection\\" under Article 25 of Directive 95/56/EC, when it comes to the transfer of personal information from the EU to the US. This executive decision by the European Commission was called into question by the 2013 Edward Snowden revelations. In essence Schrems therefore argued that the Safe Harbor system would violate his fundamental right to privacy, data protection and the right to a fair trial under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The oral hearing before the CJEU was held on 24 March 2015. The court's Advocate General for the case is Yves Bot. During the hearing, Bot asked the European Commission lawyer Bernhard Schima what advice he could give him if he was worried about his data being at the disposal of US authorities. Schima replied that he might consider closing down his Facebook account, if he had one. He said the European Commission was unable to guarantee that \\"adequate\\" safeguards for the protection of data are met, a remark that Schrems said was the most striking thing he heard at the hearing. Bot delivered his opinion on 23 September 2015. He declared the Safe Harbour agreement invalid and said that individual data protection authorities could suspend data transfers to third countries if they violated EU rights. On 6 October 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that, (1) national supervisory authorities still have the power to examine EU‚ÄìUS data transfers in spite of an existing Commission decision (such as its Safe Harbour Decision in 2000 which determined that US companies complying with the principles were allowed to transfer data from the EU to the US), and (2) the Safe Harbour framework is invalid. The Court found that the framework is invalid for several reasons: the scheme allows for government interference of the protections, it does not provide legal remedies for individuals who seek to access data related to them or have it erased or amended, and it prevents national supervisory authorities from exercising their powers. Under EU law, data-sharing with countries deemed to have lower privacy standards, including the US, are prohibited. Such activities will only be possible through more expensive and time-consuming methods. On 2 December 2015, Schrems resubmitted his original complaint against Facebook with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner. He also sent similar complaints to the Hamburg and Belgian Data Protection Authorities, which both claim jurisdiction over Facebook. The complaints are designed to enforce the CJEU judgement on Facebook, which presently does not rely on Safe Harbour for its data transfers. Instead Facebook relies on pre-approved contractual agreements called \\"model clauses\\". Schrems argues that these agreements also incorporate exceptions for cases of illegal mass surveillance, and thus that the CJEU ruling applies to these agreements as well. The Irish Data Protection Commissioner took the view that Schrems had raised \\"well-founded\\" objections, but that it needs further guidance from the CJEU to determine the complaint. After the proceedings in February/March 2017, Ms Justice Costello of the Irish High Court delivered the executive summary on Oct 3, 2017, referring the case to the CJEU.  2014 Austrian class action  On 1 August 2014 Schrems filed a lawsuit against Facebook at the local Viennese courts. He enabled other Facebook users to join his case, generating a \\"class action\\" style suit, dubbed by the press as a David and Goliath suit, estimated as likely to be the largest class action privacy suit ever brought in Europe. Any Facebook user was able to assign his claim to Schrems via the fbclaim.com webpage. Within six days the participation in the suit was limited to 25,000 Facebook users, due to too many registrations, although other users could still register an interest.https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2015/04/09/facebook-is- facing-25000-users-in-vienna-court-over-eu-privacy-violations/ Schrems sued the Irish subsidiary of Facebook in the Vienna courts for a \\"token amount\\" of ‚Ç¨500 in damages per participant.https://thenextweb.com/eu/2017/11/14/25000-eu- citizens-unlikely-get-compensation-facebooks-alleged-privacy-violations/ The case was financed by the German litigation funder . According to the terms of fbclaim.com all awarded money would be forwarded to the individual participants. Schrems does not receive any financial benefit from the class action, but acts on a pro bono basis. The first hearing took place on 9 April 2015. On 1 July 2015, the Vienna District Court dismissed the class-action, saying it had no jurisdiction. The Court's decision hinged on whether Schrems was merely a consumer of Facebook, since it was on that basis that Schrems was able to pursue a case in an Austrian civil court in his place of residence. Facebook accused Schrems in having a commercial interest in his numerous legal actions against Facebook. Judge Margot Slunsky-Jost said that Schrems could benefit of the enormous media interest in his future career. The Court ruled on procedural grounds that Schrems would consequently not qualify as a consumer and could not file at his home court in Vienna. In October 2015, the Higher Regional Court of Vienna reversed the regional court ruling, finding that Schrems is a consumer and that he does not act in any commercial interest. The Higher Regional Court ruled that Schrems can bring his own claims against Facebook Ireland in Vienna, which constituted 20 of the 22 claims in the lawsuit, but is unable to form a class action for procedural reasons. This would limit Schrems to bringing only a \\"model case\\". The allowed an appeal to the Austrian Supreme Court in the key matter of forming a class action under EU and Austrian law. Schrems filed the appeal on 2 November 2015. The case is currently pending before the Austrian Supreme Court. Complaints filed under GDPR in 2018-19 Shortly after its coming into effect on 25 May 2018, Schrems filed suit under the newly promulgated General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Ireland against Google and Facebook for coercing their users into accepting their data collection policies. Three complaints totalling over ‚Ç¨3.9 billion were filed. On 18 January 2019, Schrems filed further GDPR complaints against Amazon, Apple Music, DAZN, Filmmit, Netflix, SoundCloud, Spotify, and YouTube. His non-profit, noyb.eu, alleged they failed to respond, did not include sufficient background information, or provided insufficient or unintelligible raw data. noyb predicted a maximum total fine of ‚Ç¨18.8 billion for the 8 companies.  Schrems II  At the conclusion of Schrems I, the Irish High Court officially referred the case (now called Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland and Maximillian Schrems) to the CJEU, along with eleven questions to address related to the validity of the SCC (standard contractual clauses). Judgement was presented July 16th, 2020. In September 2020, Ireland's Data Protection Commission sent Facebook a preliminary order to stop transferring data from EU citizens to the US. A fine of 4% of annual revenue will be applied if the conditions are not met. Facebook's blog published a response letter by Nick Clegg, VP of Global Affairs and Communications, on September 9th, 2020. Clegg acknowledged that the laws regarding data transfer are changing, yet still more legal clarity is needed for everyone involved, and advocated a revision to the Privacy Shield. Additionally, the response noted the seeming contradiction between the Privacy Shield, which applies to EU-US data transfers and the court invalidated, and the SCC, which apply to EU-3rd party countries and the court held still valid.

Gerbic is the co-founder of Monterey County Skeptics, founder and leader of the Guerrilla Skepticism on wikipedia (GSoW) project, a regular contributor to Skeptical Inquirer, The Skeptic Zone podcast, and a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Gerbic has focused much of her skeptical activism on people claiming to be clairvoyant mediums, such as Sylvia Browne, Tyler Henry, and Thomas John, whom she calls \\"grief vampires\\".  Skeptical activism  Gerbic was raised in Salinas, California, as a Southern Baptist. Her interest in paranormal and fringe topics began when she was frightened by reports of spontaneous human combustion, \\"the idea that you could be walking down the street and suddenly, boom!\\" Her religious upbringing was challenged in her late teens, Gerbic told Skeptical Inquirer editor Benjamin Radford, when she first encountered the term \\"atheist\\": during her junior year at Alisal High School, thanks to her home-room teacher Mr. Borman. \\"I noticed one day that he never said the ‚Äòunder God‚Äô part in the Pledge of Allegiance,\\" she said. \\"I asked him why, and he said it was because he was an atheist. I had never even heard that word before.\\" Once she found out there were other people who felt the way she did, she read everything she could on the subject. In 1996, Skeptical Inquirer magazine was pivotal in her transformation into a scientific skeptic. In 2000, Gerbic attended her first conference, the Skeptic's Toolbox in Eugene, Oregon. Gerbic started editing for wikipedia after experiences with three \\"Amazing Adventure\\" cruises put on by the James Randi Educational Foundation and several of The Amaz!ng Meetings. She wanted to do something more proactive, so she turned her attention to editing wikipedia. Her first contribution was a photo of Brian Dunning of the Skeptoid podcast. Her work in founding and running the GSoW made her an influential member of the skeptical community, leading to her becoming a consultant for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. In February 2018, the Center For Inquiry appointed her a fellow. = Guerrilla Skepticism on wikipedia = Gerbic is the founder and leader of \\"Guerrilla Skepticism on wikipedia\\" (GSoW), an organization dedicated to improving the content on wikipedia by improving and creating articles that reflect the ideals of scientific naturalism and scientific skepticism. , the Guerrilla Skepticism on wikipedia project had written or fully rewritten over 600 wikipedia pages in multiple languages, which had collectively received over 30 million views. Gerbic and Mark Edward came up with the name \\"Guerrilla Skepticism on wikipedia\\" (GSoW) to describe skeptical activism that is \\"more underground, more grass-roots, more mole- like\\". The idea for an organized effort came from Tim Farley after Gerbic was frustrated by typical WikiProjects, finding them either dormant or not user- friendly, especially for new editors. Instead, she started communicating and training other wikipedia editors directly on Facebook or using email. She stated that the formal beginning of GSoW is May 2010, yet its birthday is celebrated in June. Susan Gerbic speaks about Guerrilla Skepticism on wikipedia during the 17th European Skeptics Congress in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. Interest in the project grew after Gerbic made presentations at SkeptiCalcon, did a Sunday paper presentation at The Amaz!ng Meeting, and also created a blog on the subject. In an interview with Richard Saunders, she states that this kind of project is \\"a perfect storm, we would never have been able to do this without [the Internet]\\". Gerbic spends much of her time training the new members of the expanding team to perform basic tasks required to effectively edit the encyclopedia, tackling topics as diverse as Scientology, UFOs, and vaccines. Since its inception, the GSoW team has grown, with Wired reporting in July 2018 that the project had more than 120 international editors. Members of GSoW are encouraged to identify noteworthy skeptical or science articles in the general media that could serve as significant references, and then cite these in any applicable wikipedia pages. Gerbic calls such edits \\"backwards editing\\", which is the reverse of the more typical process where an editor will work on a single wikipedia article, enhancing it with references from many sources. GSoW editors seek out skepticism-related articles that are in need of improvement by the addition of references from popular writing, podcast, and other citations. They will share research and otherwise collaborate amongst the team. Sometimes they will directly interview notable persons to improve the citations and resources. Gerbic used the example of psychic Sylvia Browne's wikipedia page during the Amaz!ng Meeting lecture, suggesting that people looking for information might prefer wikipedia as a neutral, virus free, user-friendly site. She calls this the Goldilocks effect. Gerbic states that the \\"We Got Your Wiki Back Project!\\" is a popular GSoW sub- project. The project's goal is to improve the wikipedia pages of skeptical spokespeople, especially when they are in the media's eye and their wikipedia page views tend to spike. The intention is that people should find great, reliable information on wikipedia. In August 2012 Gerbic began forming and training non-English editors. Beginning with the \\"Lets Start with Jerry\\" project, all teams were asked to translate the English Jerry Andrus wikipedia page into as many languages as possible. Arabic, Afrikaans, Dutch, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Portuguese articles were completed under her guidance. Gerbic presenting on GSoW at CSICon in 2017 In late 2017 Gerbic toured Europe with the \\"About Time Tour\\" and spoke at many skeptical activist gatherings. During this tour, she was a guest on Bloomberg TV Bulgaria, and the interview was documented in an October 6 article, \\"Can we trust wikipedia?\\" Gerbic was a featured speaker at CSICon in 2017 where she presented \\"Beyond the Choir: The Guerrilla Skepticism on wikipedia Project (GSoW)\\" which focused on recruiting for the GSoW team. = Psychic activism = Gerbic focuses much of her skeptical activism on clairvoyant mediums, who she calls grief vampires because they prey on desperate families that would do anything to talk to their loved ones or pay anything to find their missing child. Gerbic credits skeptic Robert S. Lancaster for being \\"super influential to my 'career' in the skepticism community\\" as well as specifically sparking her interest in exposing mediums as frauds.\\" In an online 2018 Skeptical Inquirer article, Gerbic summarizes common techniques which psychics use to achieve their effects, ranging from taking advantage of how the human brain processes information, to using cold reading and hot reading techniques.  Sylvia Browne  In 2012, Gerbic and Edward organized a protest against Sylvia Browne when she appeared at the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on July 13 of that year. Joined by Benjamin Radford, Ross Blocher, Bob Blaskiewitz, Jay Diamond, and others, the group stood outside the venue and handed out leaflets describing cold-reading techniques and describing some of so-called psychic predictions Browne has made over the years that have been proven to be incorrect. Gerbic's character \\"Susanna\\" with Chip Coffey in 2014  Chip Coffey  In 2014, Gerbic organized a sting on well-known psychic Chip Coffey which she code-named Operation Bumblebee. She and two associates created false identities and false dead relatives, complete with backstories and pictures (of real, still living people), and attended a Coffey event in San Jose. Mingling with attendees before the show started, the three talked as much as they could about their supposedly dead relatives, hoping that some of Coffey's assistants might overhear. During the show, Coffey did indeed do readings on each of the three, claiming to be in contact with each of the supposedly dead relatives, confidently relating details about completely made up people, including some of what Gerbic and her associates had talked about before the show.  Tyler Henry  In 2015, up-and-coming psychic Tyler Henry came to Gerbic's attention. Henry had a new television show on the E! Network, and Gerbic noticed that a Google search on the show or Henry resulted in a return of mostly favorable, uncritical articles. In what she called Operation Tater Tot, Gerbic enlisted well-known skeptical activists to write about Henry, and provide an alternate point of view that would balance the uncritical perception being presented by the media services. The activists who published on Henry as part of this operation included Sharon Hill, Hemant Mehta, Jerry Coyne, Caleb Lack, Stephen Propatier, and David Gorski. Beginning in 2016, Gerbic wrote a series of articles concerning Henry, which were published by Skeptical Inquirer: *Grief Vampires Don't Come Out Only at Night *Operation Tater Tot: Following Up On A Grief Vampire *Tip the Canoe of Tyler Too! *Return of the Grief Vampire Tyler Henry *Anatomy of a Reading *Eventually I'm going to piss off Tyler Henry *The One Where ‚ÄúPsychic‚Äù Tyler Henry Reads Alan Thicke *Nancy Grace Should be Ashamed of Herself!  Tim Braun  In 2015, Gerbic enlisted Heather Henderson to help in a followup to the Chip Coffey sting. Gerbic's team, without Henderson's participation, created several interconnected fake Facebook accounts, several of which friended various well-known psychics. Then Henderson, posing as the bereaved mother of a deceased 13-year old, would get a private reading from psychic Tim Braun. Because Henderson knew none of the details of \\"her\\" Facebook page, this would be a double-blind test in that she would not be able to give Braun any feedback, inadvertent or otherwise, on his accuracy. With permission to record, Henderson had an hour reading with Braun, who claimed to be in communication with her non-existent sons, husband and family. Operation Ice Cream Cone, as Gerbic calls it, did not establish that Braun used any information from the fake Facebook pages, but every statement that he made to Henderson was incorrect. The full audio of the reading is available on YouTube. Thomas John Lifetime produced a reality TV show starring purported psychic medium Thomas John called Seatbelt Psychic. It stars John as a ridesharing company driver who surprises ‚Äúunsuspecting‚Äù passengers when he delivers messages from their deceased relatives. John's alleged psychic abilities in the context of the show have been challenged by Gerbic, who discovered that John's passengers are actually actors, several of which are documented in IMDb. Gerbic concluded that the riders were likely hired to ride with John, but were probably not acting when talking with him. She concluded that the details about their lives mentioned by John were easily found on social media sources, and likely fed to John, making the readings actually hot readings. One rider, Wendy Westmoreland, played a character on Stalked by a Doctor, a TV show also produced by Lifetime. \\"Susanna Wilson\\" (Gerbic) and \\"Mark Wilson\\" (Mark Edward) undercover, with unsuspecting John after their 2017 reading In March 2017, Thomas John was caught doing a hot reading in a sting operation named \\"Operation Pizza Roll\\", which was planned and implemented by Gerbic and mentalist Mark Edward. The unmarried couple, Gerbic and Edward, attended John's show using aliases, and were \\"read\\" as a married couple Susanna and Mark Wilson by John. During the entire reading, John failed to determine the actual identities of Gerbic and Edward, or that they were being deceptive during his reading. All personal information he gave them matched what was on their falsified Facebook accounts, rather than being about their actual lives, and John pretended he was getting this information from Gerbic and Edward's supposedly dead‚Äîbut actually nonexistent‚Äîrelatives. As Jack Hitt reported in The New York Times: These details were from the falsified Facebook accounts for the pair which were prepared by a group of skeptics in advance of the reading, and Gerbic and Edward were not aware of the specific information in these accounts. This blinding was done in order to avoid John later being able to claim he obtained the false information by reading Gerbic and Edward's minds. In her article about this sting, Gerbic also revealed that during an after-show private event, John disclosed in a group setting that at least one of the people in the audience, for which he did a reading, was actually his own student. When Hitt reached out to John for comment, John insisted that he did not use Facebook, saying \\"I do remember her [Gerbic] coming to an event... I recognized her because she was there with that other guy who wrote that book.\\" He also told Hitt that \\"I have my eyes closed for an hour and a half when I'm doing readings. If she spoke up during that period of time, I don't remember that.\\" John also argued that the entire experiment wasn't really scientific enough, saying \\"For Susan to come to a reading and get a two-minute reading and say, well, 'I made a fake post about my dog, Buddy, and my father who died,' it's really not any sort of scientific testing of psychic powers.\\" He added, \\"First off, someone will have to be a scientist to do a scientific experiment, not someone who used to be a photographer at Sears.\\" When asked whether psychics would change their behavior now that they knew her methods, Gerbic said: \\"I hope they see Gerbics in their audience every time they look out and wonder if we might be there.\\" Operation Pizza Roll was summarized by Claus Larsen on SkepticReport.com in an article titled Is Thomas John a real psychic? Not a ghost of a chance!, which also included an interview of Gerbic about the sting and its aftermath. In a June 2019 Skeptical Inquirer article titled Thomas John Revisited, Gerbic reported on the aftermath of the sting. This including a report of a \\"Facebook Live\\" stream, where John attempted to prove his paranormal powers to fans following the sting revelation by doing what was claimed to be a \\"scientifically controlled reading\\" of a supposed stranger. Gerbic dissected the performance, giving details as to why it was the opposite of scientifically controlled, and described how once again Facebook information could easily have been accessed, despite assurances otherwise. \\"One of my team members gave me a list of all the hits that Thomas John got during the reading... and then my team member gave me screenshots of [the sitter's] Facebook page where she posts things that are the same as what Thomas John told her.\\" Also, despite John's claims that \\"NO I do not Google people. NO I do not research people. NO I do not go onto people's obituaries. I do not go onto Ancestry.com.\\" Gerbic's article includes screenshots of John's monitor captured during the live steam. These pictures contain saved reading lists from past Google searches, including searches for specific individuals as well as for intelius.com, a website which states that it is \\"a confidential way to find people so you can reconnect or just get more info on a person. People Search reports can include phone numbers, address history, age & date of birth, relatives, and more. Find a person you're curious about ‚Äî search today!\\" In a June 2019 Skeptical Inquirer article titled I'm Speechless! Thomas John Reads KJBK Fox2 Derek Kevrea, Gerbic reported on an appearance by Thomas John on a daytime TV show where he gave a reading to staff meteorologist, Derek Kevrea, and claimed to deliver messages from his dead relative. Kevra's feedback was that what John told him was accurate. In a Facebook video, Kevra later said \\"I'm speechless ... Thomas John communicated with my grandpa ... He said he is proud of you ... it's a miracle I held it together.\\" In her article, Gerbic reported that with a little research she discovered the information provided was available from social media and other sources available to John. Regarding Kevrea's proclamation, Gerbic says: In an August 2019, Gerbic followed-up Thomas John Revisited with another article, Three Parents Reveal The Truth About Psychic Thomas John, which covered the aftermath of her sting operation. The article investigates a video uploaded by John on March 24, shortly after The New York Times sting article was published, in which John reads \\"three grieving women\\", and claims the results validate his paranormal powers. In her article, Gerbic does a point-by-point analysis of these readings, and offers evidence that the items claimed to have been \\"impossible\\" for John to know without supernatural help, were easily available online. Gerbic's conclusion included: Matt Fraser Before The New York Times would run a story documenting Gerbic's successful sting operation against Thomas John, the paper wanted to have one of their journalists embedded in another sting operation to witness the entire process from the beginning. Thus, Jack Hitt observed what was called \\"Operation Peach Pit\\", a sting following a procedure similar to the one used against Thomas John. In this case, the target was medium Matt Fraser. According to Hitt, Fraser \\"is a young Long Island psychic who resembles Tom Cruise in the role of an oversharing altar boy. He has been on the circuit for years, has a book under his belt and works some Doubletree or Crowne Plaza back room every two or three days.\\" As with the Thomas John operation, Facebook accounts were created and populated with false data about fake people. In January 2018, paranormal investigator Kenny Biddle and a group of five friends, using aliases matching the faked Facebook accounts, attended Fraser's show at the Valley Forge Casino in King of Prussia. As Biddle reported in Skeptical Inquirer: Biddle also reported, \\"I went into this experience... willing to see if there was anything truthful to the claims made by Matt Fraser... [but] he didn't seem to demonstrate any supernatural ability, just a knack for fast- talking his customers into believing he could talk to spirits.\\" The New York Times reported on this sting in the same article in which it reported on the successful Thomas John sting. Jeanette Wilson On May 28, 2020, Gerbic infiltrated an online event by purported psychic healer Jeanette Wilson and provided a recording of her interactions with Wilson to several media outlet. The Spinoff reported that Wilson had made numerous false and conspiratorial claims, including that the coronavirus was man-made and was accidentally released and was going to \\"miraculously disappear\\" by the end of 2020, and that the use of ventilators for COVID-19 treatment was misguided and patients just needed antibiotics. Wilson also said she had been told [by spirits] that by December of 2020 , \\"a lot more is going to be out in the open, a lot more people are going to know exactly what is happening and what's been behind it.\\" She said the revelations will include that \\"money is being controlled by very few people. There's about 300 people that have basically been in charge of the world. And these people are going to be exposed, and their nefarious doings are being exposed as well...\\" Wilson also said \\"God created this body with an immune system, so I'm not a believer in vaccines... =Monterey County Skeptics= Gerbic attended the Skeptic's Toolbox in Eugene, Oregon in 2002. Ray Hyman, the leader of the Toolbox, advised her to start her own local conference. In 2007 Steve Wheller, another skeptic who lived in a nearby city, messaged her on the JREF forum because of her profile. Together, they used Yahoo Groups to find other like-minded skeptical activists and formed the Monterey County Skeptics (MCS). The MCS participated in the \\"There's Nothing in it\\" 10:23 Campaign by overdosing on many homeopathic tablets. To demonstrate the effects of homeopathy, Gerbic personally took 80 pellets (15 doses) of Boiron 30C Belladonna. In 2011, during SkeptiCal, Gerbic joined in with over 100 attendees to take an overdose (15 times recommended) of homeopathic caffea cruda which is used for sleepiness. On January 3, 2015, the Monterey County Skeptics had the first SkepticCamp in Northern California. The event was emceed by Mark Edward and was a day of free presentations on skepticism, critical thinking, science, and related topics. Lectures included eight speakers, including Gerbic, whose presentation was reporting back on a 6 months long psychic sting. A Monterey Herald reporter who attended the conference stated, \\"SkeptiCamp Monterey 2015, [is] a gathering of people who choose to take just about everything with a grain of salt ‚Äî and probably a whole tablespoon.\\" The MCS held its third annual \\"SkeptiCamp Monterey\\" in January 2017 and it was covered by the Monterey Herald. In the article, Gerbic was quoted as saying: \\"This is our first year that we‚Äôre really trying to grow. And it's the first time we‚Äôre bringing a speaker here from farther away and bringing them to a bigger venue.\\" She was referring to professional skeptic, author/speaker Benjamin Radford who is the author of ‚ÄúBad Clowns‚Äù and who has investigated a variety of unexplained phenomena and written on a wide variety of topics of interest to skeptics. Speaking about the mission of people interested in scientific skepticism in general and the MCS in particular, Gerbic also said \\"We're all on a path and all on a journey of trying to find out what is real, and scientific skepticism is a method of finding that out.\\" = Conference promotion = QEDcon 2014 with Michael Marshall, Eran Segev and Samantha Stein The topic of skeptical conference attendance received much attention on Gerbic's bi-weekly segments on the Skeptic Society's Skepticality podcast. In her November 2014 article for Skeptical Inquirer about the Skeptic's Toolbox, she describes the annual conference held in Eugene, Oregon, and discussed the importance of conference attendance, stating \\"we know our best asset is our people.\\" In October 2015, Gerbic conducted a series of workshops in Australia, culminating with her appearance as a guest speaker at the Australian Skeptics' Convention. In 2016 and 2017, to promote both CSICon events, Gerbic interviewed many of the scheduled speakers in advance of those conferences. These interviews, which were published by the Center for Inquiry, included Bob Novella, Maria Konnikova, Sheldon W. Helms, Evan Bernstein, Kavin Senapathy, James Alcock, Robert Brotherton, Richard Saunders, Kevin Folta, Natalie Newell (producer/director of Science Moms), Kenny Biddle, Taner Edis, Britt Hermes, Mark Edward, Craig Foster, Harriet Hall, and conference MC George Hrab. In December 2019, She was also a speaker at the Australian Skeptic's Convention, where she spoke about her stings on Thomas John and some other psychic mediums. The talk itself was called \\"Grief Vampires\\". Reaction Gerbic's skeptical activism work has drawn criticism from alternative medicine and paranormal claim proponents. In an interview with Tim Farley about the wikipedia controversy with Deepak Chopra and Rupert Sheldrake, Gerbic stated that she understands the frustration that public figures must have over articles that change without their control, but that accusations of canvasing to recruit and train editors in a particular area have typically resulted from misinterpreting wikipedia rules. \\"wikipedia needs people to edit...\\" and \\"pseudoscience\\" must be well substantiated before it can be added to an article. Skeptics also have edits removed when not well cited. wikipedia is too important to be vandalized... it is too important for us to ignore.\\" In February, 2015, in an article for Skeptic titled Considering a Complaint About Skeptical Tactics, Daniel Loxton examined the controversy regarding Gerbic's various sting operations, chronicling the opinions of pseudoscience advocates as well as people in the skeptical movement. This was the first of a series of articles in which Loxton examined the larger questions brought to the forefront by Gerbic's undercover sting activities, namely: \\"Should false claims in the paranormal realm be identified and the truth about them revealed? And, if so, what methods may be justifiably used to accomplish that end?\\" Reacting to Operation Pizza Roll, Thomas John criticized Gerbic's methodology: \\"For Susan to come to a reading and get a two-minute reading and say, well, 'I made a fake post about my dog, Buddy, and my father who died,' it's really not any sort of scientific testing of psychic powers. First off, someone will have to be a scientist to do a scientific experiment, not someone who used to be a photographer at Sears.\\"  Awards and honors * \\"In the Trenches\\" award at the 2012 Skeptic's Toolbox * \\"James Randi Award for Skepticism in the Public Interest\\" at The Amaz!ng Meeting 2013 * 2017 Award from James Randi Educational Foundation (shared with \\"her team of 'guerrilla skeptics'\\") * Appointed fellow of the Center For Inquiry, February 2018. { Grothe (left) and Randi (right), receives the James Randi Award for Skepticism in the Public Interest at TAM 2013.

It was founded in 2012, and has subsequently grown to export worldwide. Company history The brewery began life on a farm in Royal Deeside, Aberdeenshire with a student loan. The first beer produced was Armageddon, which the company claimed in press releases was the world's strongest beer at 65% alcohol by volume (ABV). Some batches of the beer were incorrectly manufactured to a strength of 15.2% ABV. In 2013, Brewmeister replaced Armageddon with a stronger beer called Snake Venom claiming 67.5% ABV, and put a warning label on the bottle advising consumers to only drink one per sitting. It retailed at ¬£50 for a 275ml bottle. Brewmeister claimed that the beer \\"tastes like a liquor and has a whole host of different flavours, ranging from bubblegum to caramel.\\" However, Guinness Book of Records still consider the strongest beer ever sold the Brewdog's \\"The End of History\\" with 55% ABV. In March 2014, the company announced they would move to new facilities at the Isla Bank Mills in Keith and quadruple beer production while in May of the same year, the company won the BQ Scottish Business Award for Export. Richard Lochhead, member of Scottish Parliament for Keith, said that the move would be \\"a successful addition to Moray's strong food and drinks sector.\\" The brewery currently employs 13 people. Production The strength of the beer comes from fractional freezing, which involves cooling the beer to a low temperature to the point where water freezes but alcohol does not. The ice is then removed, leaving a higher percentage of alcohol behind. The company claims to use natural spring water for brewing and claims to use unusual ingredients in their beers. In 2014, they announced that 90% of their product was being exported. Controversy In 2014 the Advertising Standards Agency censured Brewmeister for misleading advertising, stating that it was possibly ethyl alcohol that had been added to Snake Venom to reach the desired ABV of 67.5%. Investment In 2014, Brewmeister re-launched following the formation of a Board of Directors which came about after Brewmeister was partially bought by a syndicate of Scottish business figures. This included Scott Carnegie, a former Chairman of Dundee United Football Club. Brewmeister also received investment from Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Investment Bank. Scottish Enterprise are also holders of shares in the company.

The primary election was held on June 3, 2014, and the general election was held on November 4, 2014. Four of the nine seats of the San Diego City Council were contested. Two city council incumbents ran for re-election in their same district and one ran for election in a new district due to redistricting. Municipal elections in California are officially non-partisan, although most members do identify a party preference. A two-round system was used for the election, starting with a primary in June followed by a runoff in November between the top-two candidates if no candidate received a majority of the votes in the first round. City Council Council Districts used for the 2014 election The 2014 election was the second to use the new districts created by the 2010 Redistricting Commission. It was the first time that even- numbered districts 2, 4, 6, and 8 were up for election using the new boundaries. Incumbents Myrtle Cole (District 4) and David Alvarez (District 8) won re-election by getting more than 50% in the June primary. Lorie Zapf (District 2) was also re-elected in the June primary, but in a different district then the one she previously represented due to redistricting. Chris Cate and Carol Kim were the top two vote-getters in the primary for the open seat in District 6. Cate was elected with a majority of the vote in the November 2014 general election. = District 2 = On March 3, 2014, Kevin Faulconer resigned from the City Council to assume the office of Mayor of San Diego, having won the special election to replace Bob Filner. This created a vacancy in District 2. Because the vacancy occurred with less than a year left in Faulconer's term, the vacancy was filled by a City Council appointment per the City Charter. On April 7, 2014, the San Diego City Council voted 5-3 on a second ballot to appoint Ed Harris, head of the city's lifeguard's union, to serve the balance of Faulconer's term. Per the City Charter, Harris was ineligible to run for reelection in 2014. District 2 consisted of the communities of Bay Ho/Bay Park/Morena, Midway/North Bay, Mission Beach, Ocean Beach, Pacific Beach, and Point Loma. Incumbent council member Ed Harris, who had been appointed to finish the balance of Kevin Faulconer's term, was ineligible to run for reelection. Lorie Zapf, who had been serving as the council member representing District 6, was forced to run in District 2 due to a 2010 redistricting. Zapf was elected with a majority of the votes in the June primary. = District 4 = District 4 consisted of the communities of Alta Vista, Broadway Heights, Chollas View, Emerald Hills, Encanto, Greater Skyline Hills, Jamacha, Lincoln Park, Lomita Village, North Bay Terrace, Oak Park, O'Farrell, Paradise Hills, Redwood Village, Rolando Park, South Bay Terrace, Valencia Park, and Webster. Incumbent council member Myrtle Cole was reelected with a majority of the vote in June primary. = District 6 = District 6 consisted of the communities of Clairemont Mesa, Kearny Mesa, Mira Mesa, Mission Valley, North Clairemont, and Rancho Pe√±asquitos. Incumbent council member Lorie Zapf shifted from District 6 to District 2 due to the 2010 redistricting. Chris Cate and Carol Kim received the most votes in the June primary. Since no candidate won a majority, a runoff was held in November to determine the winner. Cate won a majority in the runoff and was elected to the City Council. = District 8 = District 8 consisted of the southern communities of San Diego and those along the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, including the communities of Barrio Logan, Egger Highlands, Grant Hill, Logan Heights, Memorial, Nestor, Ocean View Hills, Otay Mesa West, Otay Mesa East, San Ysidro, Sherman Heights, Stockton, and Tijuana River Valley. Incumbent council member David Alvarez was elected after receiving a majority of the votes in the June primary. =Aftermath= The primary victories by Cole and Alvarez ensured that self-identified Democrats would continue to control at least a five-seat majority on the City Council. However, the District 6 general election race left open the question of whether or not they would also continue to control a six-seat two-thirds supermajority of the city council, allowing them to overrule a mayoral veto by Republican Mayor Kevin Faulconer on issues that split along party lines. Cate ultimately won the district 6 runoff, denying the self-identified democrats a supermajority. On December 10, 2014, the new council was sworn in. For their first action, the council voted 4‚Äì5 on a motion of whether to reappoint Todd Gloria as council president, with Sherri Lightner joining the four council republicans to defeat the measure. The council then successfully voted to appoint Lightner as the council president with a vote of 7‚Äì2, with only Gloria and David Alvarez in opposition.

Description and history The Jeremiah Hart House stands in The Hill, a cluster of closely spaced historic houses bounded on the north by Deer Street and the east by High Street at the northern edge of downtown Portsmouth. This grouping was created by a road widening project from houses originally located on or near Deer Street. This house stands near the center of the group, east of the Phoebe Hart House and north of the Hart-Rice House. It is a 2¬Ω story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, clapboarded exterior, and central chimney. Its main facade is four bays wide, with asymmetrical placement of windows around a centered entrance. The entrance is the most elaborate element of the exterior, with pilasters, a transom window, entablature, and full gabled pediment. The interior of the building has a number of original features, including a narrow three-run staircase in the entrance vestibule. This house was originally located on Deer Street, set on a narrow lot with its side facing the street. From its style it dates to the last quarter of the 18th century, and may have been built by Michael Whidden, a master builder who lived across the street from its original location.

To respond to the expansion of Memphis to the east, Shelby County bought several parcels to form the first \\"work farm\\" (penal farm), insane asylum and poor house. The simple, identical houses constructed for these purposes are still evident on Pope Street and Lamphier Avenue. The intersection at National Street and Summer Avenue is where the Raleigh Springs Electric Railway line of the trolley system turned north toward Raleigh.hhbcmemphis.org/history The original light rail line was financed by B.I. Duke, one of the North Carolina tobacco Dukes (Duke University, Duke Power & Light). He owned \\"the largest and finest\\" of the hotels in the renowned spa/resort of Raleigh Springs, and was insuring ready access by Memphis businessmen who would install their families in Raleigh for the summer. The first school of Highland Heights was formed in a hotel near this same intersection on the property which currently holds Highland Heights Baptist Church and school. National is a street divided by a grassy median, once the location of the streetcar tracks. This particular line in the tram system is significant because it carried business owners downtown to work from Raleigh Springs, where they would install their families for the summer, commuting by rail to their downtown businesses.10Aug1980 Commercial Appeal column 'Midsouth Memoirs' by Paul R. Coppock. When the Highland Heights Elementary and High School were built, the 3 acres were donated by A.B. Treadwell and family in 1915. In 1939, the schools were renamed in his honor. The first class graduated Treadwell High School in 1942. The term \\"the Heights,\\" in this context, refers to Highland Heights, Grahamwood Heights, and Mitchell Heights of Memphis, Tennessee.http://www.thecornerofhighlandheights.orgThe History of Highland Heights by Joe Walk There are other neighborhoods in Memphis which incorporate the word 'heights' in their name. These three are contiguous. Their newsletter is also titled 'The Heights.' Highland Heights includes the area bounded by Summer Avenue (also known as U.S. Highways 70 & 79, and formerly known as the Nashville HighwayTennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, U. of TN Press, Knoxville) on the south, Pope Street on the west, Macon Road on the north, and Homer Street on the east. Residents of the Nutbush neighborhood have been known to claim an eastern portion of this, up to Highland Street, as part of Nutbush. Mitchell Heights advocates claim all of this, and more, west to Tillman Street, as part of Mitchell Heights. Neighborhood-naming in Memphis is not an exact science.

He is noted particularly for \\"Child's law\\" (1911), which is an equation that describes the electric current that flows between the plates of a vacuum tube. Vacuum tubes were the main components in electronics from about 1905 to 1960, when transistors and integrated circuits mostly supplanted them. Child's Law is still a staple of textbooks treating charged particle motion in vacuum and in solids. Child was raised in Frewsburg, New York, where his father was a Baptist pastor. He received an A. B. degree from the University of Rochester (in Rochester, New York) in 1890. In 1897, he received a Ph.D. from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. In 1897 he was a scientific visitor at the University of Berlin in Germany. In 1898 he was appointed a professor of physics at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York, where he spent the rest of his career. In 1907‚Äì08 he was a visitor to the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England, where he worked with J. J. Thomson. He published a book Electric Arcs in 1913. Between 1895 and 1933 Child published 28 papers in Physical Review, which was perhaps the principal US physics journal in that era. The equation known as \\"Child's Law\\" describes the electric current between two metal plates in a vacuum tube; the current flows when a power supply applies a voltage between the plates. One plate, the cathode, is heated hot enough that it will emit electrons well. The second plate, the anode, is unheated. When the voltage between the anode and the cathode is positive, the negatively charged electrons are attracted to the anode. They fly through the vacuum, and are registered as the electric current drawn from the power supply. When the voltage is negative, the electrons are repelled by the anode, and the current is essentially zero. Child's law predicted the current at lower positive voltages, at which the current isn't limited by the electron emission process. Rather, a cloud of electrons forms near the cathode and limits the current. Child showed that this current was proportional to the voltage raised to 3/2 power (V3/2). The current only depends on the properties of the electron through the ratio of the electrical charge of the electron to its mass. Although Child's Law is usually used to describe electron currents, Child actually derived the equation in order to estimate the current of positively charged atomic ions. The only change is that charge to mass ratios for ions are much smaller than for the electron. The application to electrons was made in 1913 by Irving Langmuir, Langmuir discovered Child's earlier derivation of the space-charge equation after the initial submission of this paper. and the equation is also called the Child-Langmuir Law because of this. Child's original paper was cited in scientific papers more than 600 times in the century following its publication; in 2013, the paper was cited 32 times.Citation search for doi:10.1103/PhysRevSeriesI.32.492 at the Web of Science; subscription required.

History The East India Company obtained from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj- ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as Dihi Panchannagram and Tiljala was one of them. It was considered to be a suburb beyond the limits of the Maratha Ditch.Cotton, H. E.

In the eastern fringes of Kolkata, the neighbourhoods such as Tangra, Tiljala, Topsia and Dhapa, were populated largely with people who migrated from poverty-ridden and caste-ridden villages, in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. They came with dreams of a better life but landed in the slums with open drains, pigsties, factory chimneys and pungent chemicals. They found work in the tanneries and factories and also engaged in menial work. A big proportion of them were Chamars, but there also were Doms, Dosads, Mehtars and Kahars. They were all Harijans and they formed a majority. They escaped from the petty persecution they faced in their villages but were far removed from the mainstream of urban life and culture.

Significant buildings  *Too House The Too house was built in 1952, an Art Deco-style house located within the Golden Triangle business and commercial district. *Chin Woo Stadium The sports complex is located at Jalan Hang Jebat, 50150, Kuala Lumpur. It is an international martial arts organisation which was built in 1953. The physical and spiritual philosophy of Chin Woo was first introduced to Malaya in the 1920 and founded in Shanghai in the 1910s by Huo Yuan Jia (Master Fok Yuen-Kap). The initialisation of project was officiated by His Royal Highness Selangor Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah on 31 August 1951. The opening ceremony was honourably officiated by His Excellency, Sir. Mc Donald, the High Commissioner of Great Britain, witnessed by local leaders on 11 December 1953. Y. T. Lee is one of the committee of the opening ceremony of Chin Woo Stadium. *Methodist Boys School This school was built on 16 November 1955. Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah took the key from the architect Mr Y.T. Lee to open the new $110,000 wing of the Methodist Boys School in Sentul, Kuala Lumpur. This school was founded by the late Rev. Preston L Peach in 1936, and the first batch of classes had seven students. *UMNO building The rectangular four-story structure was built in 1955 to act as the headquarters for the UMNO (United Malays National Organisation) party. It is located on Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman. *Federal Hotel The Federal Hotel was built in 1957 to accommodate the declaration of Merdeka, Malaya's independence Day. It was founded by Tan Sri Low Yat. An article written in 1971 presented Lee as an expert in hospitality design, and credited him with a total of four hotels, two of them in Bukit Bintang. Ar Azaiddy Abdullah writes that Lee worked with one of Kuala Lumpur's municipal architects, Eric Taylor, on the Merlin Hotel, 1957-1959. The hotel was later changed to the Concorde Hotel. Most of the original interiors have been reconfigured, including the once famous Harlequin Bar and Grill. *Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka The construction was completed on 31 January 1962. Its most prominent feature is a 65 by 25-foot glazed mosaic mural, designed by Ismail Mustam. The complex's layout on the prominent site was likened to the United Nations: a figural auditorium faces the traffic circle, and behind it lies the broad administrative block. *Masjid Jamek Kampung Baru The building was officially opened on 12 July 1957. It can host up to 7,000 worshippers during the Muslim Friday prayer in the Malay village, Kampung Baru, that lies minutes away from the PETRONAS Towers. Its central feature is a large column-free prayer hall. One of the principal entrances is at a right angle to the qibla wall. The building's windows take the form of a modified Islamic arch, and there are onion domes, but otherwise the building is relatively free of decoration. With its thin pilasters and restrained geometric work, it is an early example of Islamic modernism. Masjid Jemek Mosque was under renovation during the year of 2015. *Masjid Ar-Rahman It was officially opened on 23 August 1963 by Tuanku Syed Putra Al-Haj Ibni Almarhum Syed Hassan Jamalullail. The total cost of the building was $350,000. It was built to serve students at the University of Malaya. It was initially modern in its stylings, although subsequent renovations have made it look more traditional. It is located on Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman. *Masjid Al- Ubudiyah This mosque in the small town of Kerling opened in 1964. When it was built, there was not initially electricity supplied to the building. It is an example of Middle Eastern and Islamic forms meshed with modernism. The repetitive patterns for the fencing, the rounded arch windows, and the pointed arches between the columns in Masjid Al- Ubudiyah show a similarity between the design and materials used in the Masjid Jamek Kampung Baru, Kuala Lumpur.http://eprints.utm.my/1780/1/Mosque_style-tajuddin.pdf A highly unusual feature of the mosque is the incorporation of a window in the mihrab. Mosque in Kerling *Mosque in Kuala Kubu Bharu\\"\\"\\"* *Masjid India Mosque The Masjid India is an Indian Muslim mosque located in Little India, Kuala Lumpur. It was officiated by the Sultan of Selangor in 1966, although the site was founded in 1863. The mosque was built through private donations collected from the Indian Muslim community. Lee was hired, and prepared working drawings for a \\"mosque and madrasa\\" on \\"Malay Street\\" in 1963 and 1964. The project proceeded at least as far as the architect's office advertised a tender notice. The client was the South Indian Muslim Committee on Jalan Mountbatten. The extent to which the existing Masjid India Mosque was designed by Lee is unclear, as it has clearly been renovated multiple times since the 1960s. There is a formal similarity in the exterior facades of the Masjid India and the Masjid Jamek Kampung Baru, suggesting that Lee worked on both of them.  Other Buildings  *Tanjong Karang Hospital The Tanjong Karang hospital is a rural government hospital located in Tanjong Karang, Selangore. It was built at a cost of RM 1.73 million and began operating in 1966http://htgkarang.moh.gov.my/mmxiv/index.php/info-hospital/sejarah as the second phase of the rural development expenditure for medical and health services. It initial started with a total of 57 beds from 1966 to 1970.http://www.epu.gov.my/epu- theme/rmk2/rancangan%20malaysia%20kedua%20-%20chapter%2015.pdf *Y.W.C.A. Building The hostel and assembly hall for Young Women Christian Association (Y.W.C.A.)http://www.ymcakl.com/ was proposed by Lee Yoon Thim in 1952. It is located at Jalan Hang Jebat, Kuala Lumpur. It was built to provide safe and comfortable accommodation for young girls and women from all parts of Malaysia. As for assembly hall, it is used to organise events and programmes for less fortunate.http://ywcamalaysia.com/associations.html *Masjid Negeri The project was proposed by Y.T. Lee & Co. in 1967. Masjid Negeri Mosque is located in Kuching, Sarawak. It was built in 1987 and completed by the year of 1990. The total built in area is about 100 acres. This mosque is one of the most significant landmarks of the State. It can accommodate 10.000 worshipers at a time. *Community Hall Raub Pahang The project was proposed in 1961 by Y.T. Lee & Co. The building located at Jalan Cheroh Raub, Pahang. *Office Building This 6 storey office building was proposed by Y.T. Lee in 1954. It is located at lots 186-189, Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur. *Bank and Office Building The 5 storey Bank and Office buildings can be found at lots 7-8 sec.48, Jalan Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur. It was proposed by Y.T. Lee in 1965.  Death  Lee was one of the most important of a group of architects operating in the modernist idiom in Malaysia in the period after independence. He was a central figure for shaping the young country's global image. He was considered an expert in hotel design, deftly combining modernism with a local feel. Dato' Y.T. Lee died on 7 February 1977, at the age of 72, and was buried in the Chinese cemetery.

At the time it formed part of the hundred of Culvestan, which merged into the new hundred of Munslow in the early 12th century. For several hundred years it was known as Middleton Higford after its chief tenant Walter de Huggeford who had his main holding at Higford near Shifnal. Middleton has a Norman chapel, much renovated in the 1850s, with a Norman motte next to it. It is a grade II* listed building. Middleton Court nearby was built in 1864 by the Rouse- Boughton family of Downton Hall who owned most of the land around. Brook House, built in the late 1500s, is a timber-framed moated manor house which is also Grade II* listed. Its late 18th Century privy, 17th and 18th Century outbuilding and kiln and its stables dated 1726 are all Grade II listed.

The tenth installment in the Angry Birds series, the game is a crossover between Angry Birds and Transformers, featuring battles between the Autobirds and Deceptihogs, Angry Birds versions of the Autobots and Decepticons. It is published by Rovio Entertainment with collaboration from Hasbro. The game was released on October 15, 2014, for iOS, released on October 30, 2014, for Android. The release includes related licensed merchandise and a toy line from Hasbro. The game's catchphrase is \\"Birds in Disguised as Robots in Disguise\\". Plot The EggSpark has crashed into the surface of Piggy Island, cyberforming the Birds and Pigs and turning them into the Transformers. It has also turned the eggs into the EggBots, which are turning all pigs (except for King, Foreman, Chef, Corporal, Minion, and Professor Pig) into their minions and then turning non- living things into monsters that want to destroy life, replacing it with technological beings across the island. The Autobirds and Deceptihogs must put their differences aside to destroy the transformed pigs and to chase the mischievous Eggbots, ultimately rescuing the fate of their homeland. Gameplay The goal is to survive through the run, shooting at pigs, structures, and targets and transforming into vehicles, including cars, trucks, motorbikes, tanks, submarines and planes (which both stay at ground level)- since failure to survive results in no pigs popped and/or having no health for that character. Pigs can be eliminated by shooting directly at them, but it is sometimes easier to defeat them by shooting at the structures or making TNT explode. Since the gameplay is a side-scrolling video game, pigs who have gone out the screen can no longer be eliminated. The player can use the user's Facebook friends unlocked characters or randomly generated characters to assist in a level for a limited time. Coins may be collected either during runs, popping pigs and/or simply by waiting and collecting coins that generate over time from freed areas. Some levels or features can be only unlocked when the player has upgraded enough Transformers to level 15. In addition, gems can also be collected and can be used to purchase and to keep going through the run. Telepods The game is the fourth game in the franchise to be compatible with Angry Birds' Telepods, a toy line that is also used in other Angry Birds games such as: Angry Birds Star Wars II, Angry Birds Go, and Angry Birds Stella. When using Telepods, it can summon the toy's Transformer, and either boost its power or recharge its armor. It is a necessary to scan the toy's QR code each time after the app is closed since the application will \\"forget\\" the Telepods the user has previously scanned in.

The Guardian praised that the game appeals to Transformers fans, while also providing more proof that the Angry Birds can fit neatly into new stories and game genres, while the downside there are timers of multiple hours to upgrade a character, however gems to upgrade instantly (slowly earned or purchased with real money) make the upgrade happen instantly.

Education Beerling was educated at University of Wales, College of Cardiff where he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in Botany in 1987 followed by a PhD in 1990 for research into the biogeography, ecology and control of two important and highly invasive alien plant species Japanese knotweeed Reynoutria japonica and Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera. His PhD was supervised by Ron Walter Edwards CBE and he authored two ecological monographs on the species and scientific papers reporting simulated projections of their potential future distributions in Europe with global climate change. Research and career Beerling's research group investigate fundamental questions concerning the conquest of the land by plants and the role of terrestrial ecosystems in shaping Earth's global ecology, climate and atmospheric composition. This is achieved by approaches that integrate evidence from fossils, experiments and theoretical models applied across spatial and temporal scales. Increasingly, his group's research discoveries are informing our understanding of current global climate change issues. =Earth's atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ history= An important early success of his biophysical approach to palaeobotany was the discovery of evidence for a substantial increase in the atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ concentration and 'super- greenhouse' conditions across the Triassic-Jurassic (Tr-J) boundary, 200 million years ago, based on analyses of fossil stomata and leaf morphology from Greenland. This causally linked a catastrophic extinction event with the break-up of Pangaea. Before his group's work, the Tr-J extinction represented one of the most poorly understood of the so-called 'big-five' mass extinctions in the Phanerozoic (past 540 million years). His paper resulted in major new international research programmes that subsequently identified evidence confirming the carbon cycle perturbation in marine and terrestrial sediments world-wide. He extended this discovery by evaluating hypothesized causal mechanisms with numerical geochemical carbon cycle modelling in collaboration with the Yale University geochemist Robert Berner. Beerling was the only UK participant in an international consortium led by James Hansen (former Director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies) analysing Cenozoic CO‚ÇÇ and palaeoclimate evidence to investigate the broader societal question of the target CO‚ÇÇ level required to avoid 'dangerous' anthropogenic interference of the climate system. Stabilization of human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level avoiding this concern is a core objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The resulting 2008 'Target CO‚ÇÇ' paper made the front page of the UK newspaper The Guardian which commented: =Fossils and experimental palaeobiology= Beerling is a leading architect in the field of experimental palaeobiology, adopting advanced experimental research programmes to address fundamental questions raised by the fossil record of plant life. Characterized by the formulation and evaluation of rigorous hypotheses, these programmes demonstrate how experimental evidence serves to deepen our causal understanding of past events. By productively collaborating with Jonathan Leake, his group established essential missing functional evidence supporting the long-standing conjecture, based largely on 400-million-year-old-fossils from the Devonian Rhynie chert,Kidston, R. & Lang, W. H. On Old Red Sandstone plants showing structure, from Rhynie Chert Bed, Aberdeenshire. Part V. The Thallophyta occurring in the peat-bed; the succession of the plants throughout a vertical section of the bed, and the conditions of accumulation and preservation of the deposit.Trans. R. Soc. Edinb. 52, 855‚Äì902 (1921). that the establishment of rootless early land plants in skeletal soils was promoted by their mutualistic symbiotic partnership with soil fungi. They went on to reveal how the simulated high CO‚ÇÇ Palaeozoic atmosphere and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi synergistically enhanced plant fitness to create uniquely strong selection pressures favouring the establishment of mycorrhiza-like partnerships in 'lower' land plants. These findings now place fungi as key players in the earliest symbiotic events during the greening of the Earth's land-masses. Beerling's investigations into vegetation interactions with past environments extend to those guided by the fossil remains of ancient polar forests. Through a creative combination of experiments simulating high CO‚ÇÇ ancient polar environments, and modelling of forest biogeochemistry, his group's analyses helped define our modern understanding of the physiological ecology of Mesozoic high-latitude forests [ref]. In doing so, they overturned 'textbook dogma' concerning the adaptive significance of polar forest deciduousness, established following Scott of the Antarctic's discovery of Glossopteris fossils on the Beardmore Glacier at 82¬∫S in 1912. BBC News covered these findings in a 2003 report 'Antarctic Scott's lasting legacy' and again in a 2011 report entitled 'Secrets of Antarctica's fossilised forests'. Beerling's has published over 200 papers in leading peer reviewed scientific journals including Science and Nature. =Popular Science= Beerling's best-selling popular science book The Emerald Planet: How plants changed Earth's history presents a case for recognising the role of plants in shaping Earth's history. Reviewed in many journals (e.g. Nature) and newspapers, including The Times and The Guardian, the book was named by Oliver Sacks as his favourite non- fiction book of the year in The Observer. Sacks wrote of it Beerling promoting The Emerald Planet at the Hay Festival of Literature and Arts The Emerald Planet has been translated into three languages and attracted public acclaim and that of his academic peers. The book formed the basis of a major three- part BBC Two television series, How to Grow a Planet., for which Beerling acted as the Scientific Consultant. Enhanced public awareness of plant science followed, with the series attracting average viewing figures of 1.7 million per episode. The book was reprinted by Oxford University Press in 2009 with a foreword written by Iain Stewart, the presenter of How to Grow a Planet. Beerling is also the author of an advanced technical book Vegetation and the terrestrial carbon cycle: the first 400 million years. =History of Science= Beerling is interested in the history of science and publishes occasional scholarly articles on this theme. These have included an invited commentary entitled 'Gas valves, forests and global change: a commentary on Paul Gordon Jarvis classic 1976 paper written to celebrate the 350th anniversary of the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, and the discovery that Isaac Newton's interest in botany extended to thinking about how water moves from roots to leaves and into the atmosphere over 200 years before botanists got round to explaining it. His discovery was widely reported including in Scientific American and Science which coined the memorable 'Newton was no sap' strap line. In 2010, he wrote a piece for Nature discussing theoretical analyses revealing how plant investment in the architecture of leaf veins can be shuffled for different conditions, minimising the construction costs associated with supplying water to leaves. He placed these findings in the context of the pioneering English plant physiologist Stephen Hales's book Vegetable Staticks published in 1727. Hales observed that plants lose water by \\"perspiration\\" and then went one better by conducting experiments to quantify the process. =Funding= Beerling's research has been funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), the Department for International Development (DFID), the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),David Beerling's The Royal Society, One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: and The Leverhulme Trust. In 2012 he was awarded a prestigious European Research Council Advanced Investigator Grant to research 'Carbon dioxide regulation of Earth's ecological weathering engine: from microorganisms to ecosystems'. In 2015, he was awarded ¬£10 million for establishing a Leverhulme Centre for Climate change mitigation which hopes to revolutionise approaches to climate change mitigation and transform the evidence base needed to alter land management options for mitigating climate change and promoting food security, whilst safeguarding natural resources. The vision is to develop and assess the role of enhanced rock weathering as a means of safely removing large amounts of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) from the atmosphere to cool the planet, while also mitigating ocean acidification. the plan is to deliver these aims through Earth system modelling, lab-based controlled environment experimental investigations and large-scale field studies, embedded with social science analyses of sustainability and public engagement. Beerling, Director of the Leverhulme Centre for Climate Change Mitigation at the University of Sheffield, said: Beerling added: On November 29 2018, the BBC's Science Editor, David Shukman, reported on progress of the Centre on the National BBC news and in an accompanying BBC New online article entitled Climate change: Can 12 billion tonnes of carbon be sucked from the air? https://www.bbc.com/news/science- environment-46345280 =Awards and honours= Beerling was awarded a Philip Leverhulme Prize in Earth sciences for outstanding contributions to palaeobotany and palaeoclimatology in 2001. He was elected the 2008/9 Edward P Bass Distinguished Visiting Environmental Scholar at the Yale Institute for Biosphere Science, Yale University. The Edward P. Bass Distinguished Visiting Environmental Scholars Program was created in July 2002 with a generous gift by Edward P. Bass to the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies (YIBS), which he also established in 1991 with a generous gift to Yale University. In 2009, Beerling was awarded a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award (2009‚Äì2014), a scheme funded by the Wolfson Foundation and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills for recruiting or retaining respected scientists of outstanding achievement and potential to the UK. Beerling was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2014, his certificate of election reads: Beerling's life and career have been profiled in Steel Science, the online magazine of Science Communication at the University of Sheffield. Personal life Beerling is the son of Johnny Beerling former Controller of BBC Radio 1 and Carol Ann Beerling. Beerling married Juliette Fraser in 2011, they have one son Joshua.

His article \\"The Hindu in America\\" has been widely cited as a document describing early Indian immigration to the United States. Mukerji was born in India, and according to the San Francisco Chronicle, the son of a \\"Judge of one of the higher courts.\\" In 1901, he received an AB degree from Calcutta University. He moved to the United States and became a student at the University of California, Berkeley circa 1905. His time at UC Berkeley was widely covered by American press. In summer 1905, according to Gopal Stavig, Mukerji represented the Vedanta Society at the Lewis and Clark Exposition in Portland, Oregon. Mukerji was the President of the Association of Oriental Students at UC Berkeley during at least 1907-1908. In November 1907, he published a booklet on American colleges focused on an Indian audience; the release was covered in the San Francisco Chronicle. A subsequent article, \\"The Hindu in America,\\" was published in the Overland Monthly in April 1908. In December 1907, Mukerji gave a scathing lecture on the British empire in India to UC Berkeley's Economics Club, which was covered in the San Francisco Chronicle, in an article titled \\"Hindu Arraigns Britons for the Ruin of India: Calcutta Graduate Scores England for Overtaxing of His People.\\" In January 1908 he led a student protest against J. Lovell Murray, a Christian evangelist who was in Berkeley to give a talk titled \\"Awakening the Orient\\" organized by the local Y.M.C.A. Just before Murray was about to enter Stiles Hall to give his lecture, 16 of the 17 Indian students at UC Berkeley, including Mukerji, requested Murray to remove from his talk any references to the immorality of Hindu priests, and its use in the justification of the occupation of India by the British. Murray refused. Once Murray was finished speaking, Mukerji was invited to respond to the speaker. He spoke against the British occupation, followed by six other students from the group, until the organizers decided to shut down the event. Mukerji was a student of Professor Eugene W. Hilgard, an expert on agricultural chemistry. In 1907-1908, he received a Master of Science from the College of Agriculture at UC Berkeley; his thesis was entitled \\"A Comparative Study of Soil Columns in the San Joaquin Valley.\\" University President Wheeler, who was present at his farewell, spoke highly of his work and cited him as a role model for other Indians. In 1907, the Berkeley Daily Gazette reported that Mukerji was to \\"return to his home to take the chair of agriculture at the Calcuttat (sic) University.\\" Mukerji left for New York in March 1908. In a 1911 article, Sarangadhar Das wrote that after graduating from UC Berkeley in 1908, Mukerji \\"worked as the Superindending (sic) Chemist in a sugar factory in Porto Rico, Cuba, and now is employed in the Bengal National College.

He was also the founder of their branch at Hermit Park. However, his Soviet sympathies caused him to be expelled from the party in 1940; the Hermit Park branch was also expelled from the Labor party in 1941 for the same reasons. The branch responded by forming its own political party, the North Queensland Labor Party (NQLP). Aikens contested the 1944 state election in the seat of Mundingburra as an NQLP and was elected on 15 April. Effectively an independent (being the only member of his party in the parliament), he retained the seat in the elections of 1947, 1950, 1953, 1956 and 1957.

Democracy International has been existing as a loose network of democracy activists since 2002. The organisation was formally established in June 2011 Democracy International Founding Meeting, Kortenberg, Belgium June 2013. as a registered membership association (eingetragener Verein e.V.) according to German non- profit law. Democracy International is politically independent and funded by membership fees and individual donations. The headquarters are in Cologne, Germany.  Organisation  Individual people and democracy groups of the council are both members of the organisation. The members elect Democracy International‚Äôs executive board Democracy International's board at the general assembly, which is held at least every two years. The board steers the political course and represents the organisation externally. Democracy groups with more than seven members can become a member of the council.Democracy International's council The task of the council is to advise and to support the executive board with its work. Membership fees vary according to country of residence.Democracy International membership  Association work  Democracy International regularly runs campaigns to promote democracy. It also organizes conferences, provides knowledge on direct democracy and publishes the Direct Democracy Navigator. This online-tool helps people to compare direct-democratic instruments all over the world. = Engagement for lobby- transparency = Democracy International accuses the European Union of a lack of transparency when it comes to lobbyism. Democracy International promotes more transparency and a mandatory lobby register. Amongst others the organization started a campaign in 2014, in which proposals of citizens to dam in lobbyism in Europe have been selected. Democracy International then handed over the results to Sven Giegold, the European Parliament's rapporteur in the ‚ÄúReport on Transparency, Integrity and Accountability‚Äù. Since the Commission is headed by Jean- Claude Juncker, a voluntary lobby register has been put in place. Democracy International campaigns to make this register mandatory. = Campaign for a transnational European electoral law = The organisation promotes a transnational European electoral law. Democracy International favors European-wide, transnational electoral lists in the European Parliamentary Elections to strengthen the link between the citizens of the European Union and the parties that represent them. = Organisational support = The association also supports other democracy activists with their campaigns. Democracy International has close connections to Mehr Demokratie e.V. Germany, Mehr Demokratie Austria, Meer Democratie, Demokratie.nu in Belgium, OMNIBUS f√ºr Direkte Demokratie and the ECI campaign. = Demand for a new European Convention = Facing the legal changes of the European Union, which are the result of the European stability mechanism and the European fiscal pact, the organisation calls for the convocation of a new European Convention. A convention is an assembly not only of representatives of politics, economy and civil society, but should also include citizens. Purpose of the assembly should be to give European citizens a direct say in the European Union‚Äôs decision-making. The aim is a democratic legitimated Europe. In 2014, the organisation started a campaign called ‚ÄöDemocratic Europe Now‚Äò, which is now a broad alliance of civil society groups from all of Europe. The association has established criteria for the composition of a new European Convention. To ensure maximum democratic legitimacy, it requires the Convention members to be not only representatives of the EU institutions and the Member States, but to include representatives from the civil society sector and/or representatives directly elected by the European citizens. Additionally, the meetings should be transparent and open to the public. Rather than elaborating proposals that are then to be decided by the presidency, the Convention members should directly determine what the final draft should entail. In addition, Democracy International requires sufficient time for serious and thorough deliberation. The new Convention must give the working groups more than one year to complete their analyses and proposals. Participatory mechanisms should be in place, that allow citizens and civil society to give input and to contribute to the proceedings. To accomplish that the Convention needs to facilitate digital and traditional platforms for citizens and civil society. Finally, the results of the Convention process should be put to popular vote in all EU Member States on the same day, in a pan-European referendum. = Campaign for a European Citizens‚Äô Initiative = In 2002 Democracy International together with numerous democracy activists throughout Europe campaigned for the inclusion of the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) in the EU draft Constitutional Treaty, which then was integrated in the Treaty of Lisbon. The ECI requires one million signatures from at least seven EU Member States to suggest an EU law proposal to the European Commission. Since the launch of the ECI on 1 April 2012, Democracy International advocates that the ECI must become more citizen-friendly and that the general public must be more aware of the first tool of direct democracy at transnational level. In 2015 Democracy International has been campaigning for a reform of the European Citizens' Initiative. Window of opportunity was the revision of the ECI - the EU regulation on the European Citizens' Initiative demands a review of the ECI every three years. In this context of reform, Democracy International submitted to the EU institutions a set of reform proposals. Also, Democracy International run a broad campaign. The petition \\"Save the ECI\\", which French economist Thomas Piketty and the German political scientist Gesine Schwan both supported, was the core element of this campaign. More than 75,000 citizens from all across the EU signed the petition that Democracy International together with Mehr Demokratie e.V. and WeMove.eu handed over to the EU Parliament in Strasbourg on 28 October 2015. On the same day, the European Parliament adopted the report on the European Citizens' Initiative, which contained seven out of nine reform proposals by Democracy International. On 16 August 2017 Democracy International handed over 100,000 signatures of Europeans demanding a reinforcement of the ECI. The Commission published its proposal for a reinforced ECI by mid-September 2017. Democracy International had made eleven recommendations to the Commission. Two of them were fully accepted, six were partially accepted and three were either rejected or not mentioned. The revised ECI is expected to be in effect by the next European elections. Democracy International continues to campaign for a stronger follow up to successful ECIs. = Building a global network = Democracy International seeks to provide opportunities for activists and organisations who work on democracy to network and exchange ideas. The ‚ÄûGlobal Forum on Modern Direct Democracy‚Äú, which takes place every two years, is the central platform connecting specialists, activists and organisations working on this subject internationally.  Research & Publications  Democracy International regularly issues monitoring reports and position papers on actual direct democracy issues.Democracy International's list of publications The reports assess actually held referenda and plebiscites with international standards of direct democracy as set by the Venice Commission and leading experts on direct democracy.Venice Commission, Code of good practice. Moreover, Democracy International is a core partner of the Direct Democracy Navigator, a unique global information platform that lists legal instruments of direct democracy available throughout the world.

At the 2016 census, Paraparap had a population of 151 people. The Paraparap Parish was made available for sale in the 1850s, but was much less successful than other sales in the region, with slightly more than half of the lots being sold in the initial sales. The remaining lots were sold gradually over the subsequent decades, with some not being sold until the early twentieth century. Paraparap was first listed as an address in the 1890-91 directory. The area had a local progress association, the Paraparap and Pettavel Farmers' Progress Association, from March 1909. The association was responsible for the opening of the Paraparap State School and the Telephone Bureau and Post Office at the Moriac railway station. They later sought to improve roads within the area, and Hunts Road was opened as a result. At the road's opening in 1912, state Minister for Works William Edgar declared that project \\"the finest example of self-help I have ever seen in Victoria\\". The association was subsequently involved in the development of Hendy Main Road, which opened in 1920. Paraparap State School (No. 3634) opened on 12 December 1909 near what is now the junction of Hunts Road and Hendy Main Road. It initially operated part-time, sharing a teacher with nearby Pettavel State School, but operated full-time by 1912. Wynd writes that the school \\"was the heart of the district\\" and \\"served as both meeting hall and church\\". A tennis court was built opposite the school in 1926. The school closed on 9 November 1951 due to lack of student numbers. A postal receiving office opened at Paraparap on 16 November 1910. Paraparap Post Office opened on 1 July 1927 and closed on 19 February 1955.

The Borinqueneers unit was created by the U.S. Congress in 1899 as an all-Puerto Rican unit, and is credited with waging the last battalion-sized bayonet assault in U.S. Army history. The men of the 65th, now attached to the Army's 3d Infantry Division, were amongst the first infantrymen to meet the enemy on the battlefields of Korea. After November 1950, they fought daily against units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army after the Chinese entered the war on the North Korean side. On April 1951, the regiment participated in the Uijonbu Corridor drives and on June 1951, the 65th was the third regiment to cross the Han Ton River. The 65th took and held Chorwon and were also instrumental in breaking the Iron Triangle of Hill 717 on July 1951. In November 1951, the regiment fought off an attack by two regimental size enemy units. Colonel Juan C√©sar Cordero D√°vila was named commander of 65th Infantry on 8 February 1952, thus becoming one of the highest ranking ethnic officers in the Army. The Borinqueneers were awarded battle participation credits for the following nine campaigns: UN Defense-1950, UN Offense-1950, CCF Intervention-1950, First UN Counterattack Offensive-1951, UN and CCF Spring Offensive-1951, UN Summer-Fall Offensive-1951, 2nd Korean Winter 1951‚Äì52, Korean Summer-Fall-1952 and 3rd Korean Winter-1952-53. They are also credited with the last battalion-sized bayonet assault in U.S. Army history.U.S. House of Representatives. 2007. Hispanic American Heroes Resolution. 110th Congress, 18th session. H. Con. Res. 253. During the Korean War, the Borinqueneers were awarded one Medal of Honor to Master Sargeant Juan E Negr√≥n, nine Distinguished Service Crosses, 258 Silver Stars, 628 Bronze Stars, and 2,771 Purple Hearts. Seven hundred fifty Borinqueneers died in the Korean War. Congressional Gold Medal initiative Medina's decision to bring recognition to the Borinqueneers occurred when he attended a service academy minority alumni reunion, where he met a man named Raul Reyes Casta√±eira. A Borinqueneer and Korean War vet, Casta√±eira was the youngest of four brothers who served in Korea with the regiment. During the event, Casta√±eira pointed to a Montford Point Marine and said, \\"that Marine has a Montford Point gold medal. How can we get one?\\" At that moment, Medina decided to take action. In 2012, Medina founded the Borinqueneers Congressional Gold Medal Alliance‚Äîa group of individuals and organizations dedicated to obtaining the Congressional Gold Medal for the Borinqueneers, which was sponsored by the You Are Strong! Center on Veterans Health and Human Services. From 2012 until 2014, Medina was National Chair for the Borinqueneers Gold Medal Alliance, and the driving force behind the effort to pass a congressional bill to recognize the unit. Medina and his colleagues, conducted a multi-front campaign which included nationwide cold calling, a website launch, and numerous letters to officials and legislators, including four Puerto Rican members of Congress: Rep. Jos√© E. Serrano (D-NY), Rep. Nydia Velasquez (D-NY), Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) and Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho). In Pennsylvania, Medina's efforts were supported locally by Pennsylvania State Senator Mike Stack, his legislative assistant Juvencio Gonzalez, and veterans organizations who urged the House of Representatives and Senate to take action.Edward Colimore, \\"Regiment to Receive Long-delayed Medals,\\" Philadelphia Inquirer, July 22, 2014. Retrieved July 24, 2014. In Washington, DC, the staff of Resident Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi worked tirelessly, advocating and coordinating with both houses of congress, until a bill on behalf of the Borinqueeners was sponsored by U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Congressman Bill Posey (R-Fla.). On June 10, 2014, President Barack Obama signed the legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the Borinqueneers. In November 2014, Medina wrote an article about the Borinqueneers and the Congressional Gold Medal initiative, which was published in Army Magazine.Frank Medina, \\"Borinqueneers awarded Congressional Gold Medal,\\" Army Magazine, November 2014, pp. 69-70. Retrieved Nov. 14, 2014. In March 2015, Medina was recognized for his organization and leadership of the national Congressional Gold Medal campaign initiative. His advocacy continues with support for the renaming of East Main Street after the Borinqueneers, in the town of Bridgeport, Ct.Connecticut Latino News, \\"Projects To Honor Borinqueneers In Connecticut, On the Move,\\" by Bill Sarno, March 8, 2015. A national legacy The 65th Infantry Regiment was deactivated in 1956. The Congressional Gold Medal initiative thus had sense of urgency to ensure that at least some of the Borinqueneers would be alive to be honored. In addition, Medina told ABC News that, \\"We need to weave the contributions of not only Hispanic veterans, but all Hispanics into the fabric of American culture. We definitely need to leave a positive image.\\" Medina was also reported as having one more goal in mind for the group. \\"They deserve to have a Hollywood movie made about them,\\" he said. Recent work After departing from active military service, Medina joined the U.S. Army Reserves with the rank of mayor and worked as an IT Network Analyst and was assigned to Kabul, Afghanistan, where he viewed the progression of the country's nascent government rebuild into a modern society. In June 2012, he graduated from the University of Florida with a Master of Science degree in Industrial & Systems Engineering with a minor in Information Systems. While completing his studies at the University of Florida, Medina helped to educate and mentor many undergraduate Hispanic students in the rigors of graduate school selection, admission applications and career advice/development, as well as what industry and occupations in which to specialize.Frank Medina - You are Strong!

It is known mainly for its well preserved medieval era stone house dating from the 1300s. It is the most well-preserved medieval residential building on Gotland outside Visby.  History  The medieval limestone building is four stories tall and decorated with crow-stepped gables. A three-window gallery adorns the southern fa√ßade, and above it a door designed to bring merchandise and supplies to the top, storage floor. Originally the presently visible building was only the middle section of a considerably larger building. The medieval building has a basement and a ground floor which contained living quarters and a fireplace. A round archway leads into the first floor. The entrance gate shows traces of having been decoratively sculpted. Above it, a room that looks out the three windows on the south fa√ßade was probably used as living quarters during the summer months, and for festivities. Above it lies the top story, reserved for storage. The building is similar in style to contemporary city houses in Visby, and may have been commissioned by a Visby burgher living on the countryside. In 1925 a restoration was carried out with elements of reconstruction. It is a listed building and is privately owned. However, for visitors it is accessible.

The Goenchea Raponkarancho Ekvott (GRE), an organization of fishermen also submitted a memorandum to the Goa government against setting up of the campus, citing that it would violate the coastal regulation (CRZ) zone guidelines. However, the authorities of the Institute clarified the matter to concerned agencies of the government and the local communities and there is no violation of CRZ stipulations. According to them, the concerns are misplaced and the full-fledged infrastructure would rather be complementary and beneficial to the local communities. The concept and the design of the Institute are such that it nourishes the ecosystem around. Media also reported that all necessary permissions are in place for the development of the campus. The apprehensions of the local communities were also clarified since there was some misunderstanding on its impacts. This environment- friendly infrastructure would be fully operational very shortly.

Description  The wooden throne is an example of the subtlety and elegance of Egyptian woodwork in the 18th Dynasty.Andr√© Wiese, Tutanchamun. Das goldene Jenseits, p. 196. It is made from red wood, covered in parts by a 4 mm thick veneer of red wood. The legs are shaped like lion's paws. These paws sit atop high bases which are divided by ridges. The legs were originally covered in silver plate - some remains of which survive. The front and rear legs are strengthened by bars under the seat. These bars are whole and were originally silver-plated too. The ends of these cross bars are gilt and shaped like stylised papyrus. The very well preserved covering of the seat is made of finely woven material in a herringbone pattern. As is common for this period, the high back is inclined to the rear. The back is supported from behind by three vertical struts running in parallel. The two outer struts were supplemented with gilt wood edging. Armrests and seat frame were strengthened by gilt wood edging too and continued from the armrests up to the back of the chair. Gilt bronze nails supplement the wooden tenon joints. At the front of the armrests there are gilt portrait heads. They are busts of princess, perhaps Sitamun herself. As is usual for this period, she wears a short, round, curly wig and a broad Usekh collar. Crown, face and collar are all gilt. = Backrest = Backrest of the throne The backside of the chair's back is covered in silver and decorated with a fine feather pattern. The sides bear gilt decoration. On the front side there is a plaster relief depicting the winged sun above a scene which centres on the princess. The scene is doubled, showing Sitamun enthroned before a young woman bringing gifts, twice. Her feet sit on a footstool or flat cushion. She wears a short curly wig and the typical sidelock of Egyptian royal youth, set off by a large earring. Her head is crowned by a gazelle diadem and topped by a tall lotus bloom. She wears a broad Usekh collar on her breast, as well as bracelets on her arms. In addition she has a tight-fitting garment of closely pleated linen, stretching down to her ankles. In her hands she holds a sistrum and menat ‚Äì typical attributes of princesses and singers in the cult of Hathor. Both of the women bearing gifts are identical in appearance and costume, wearing half length wigs with an angular cut, headbands, foliage crowns, bracelets, earrings and usekh collars. They present a wide golden Usekh collar to the princess on a tray. This doubled scene is topped by a frieze of lotus blooms. The image includes the titles and names of Sitamun and the presentation of the collar is captioned \\"Bringing in the gold of the southern countries.\\" = Armrests = The inner sides of the armrests show a procession of four women bringing gifts, crowned with tall headdresses of lotus flowers which are shown alternately in side and top view. The women bear stacks of gold rings. Their ornaments and the shape of their long dresses vary from one another, otherwise their appearance mimicks that of the main scene on the back of the chair. The outside of the right armrest shows the goddess Taweret with two figures of the god Bes. Taweret is depicted in the form of a hippopotamus with sagging breasts, a crocodile's back and a lion's paws. All figures have randomly dotted fur. One of the figures of Bes swings a knife, the other plays the tambourine. The left armrest shows Bes three times. The gods Taweret and Bes served as defense from evil forces, guaranteeing health and long life. Taweret was a goddess of fertility, pregnancy and birth. Both deities were regularly depicted on beds, headrests and chairs in the 18th dynasty.  Purpose  Given the wear of the gold leaf on the backrest, the moulding of the armrests and the ornamental portrait heads, it is thought that the chair was used on a day-to-day basis. But in addition it was also a piece of ceremonial furniture. The scenes depicting a gift of gold probably refer to the first Nehebkau festival of Amenhotep III.Andr√© Wiese, Tutanchamun.

On several paintings dating from the 17th and 18th century a small, black dog resembling a Markiesje can be seen. However, the Markiesje - as currently known - has only been bred actively since the mid 1970s. The Markiesje was accepted by the Dutch Raad van Beheer op Kynologisch Gebied in Nederland as an official breed but it is not yet accepted by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale.  Character  The Dutch Raad van Beheer op Kynologisch Gebied in Nederland categorized Markiesje as a companion dog, not to be confused with a lap dog. The dog likes long walks and runs. Markiesjes are rather alert and will act as watchdog. The dog can be kept with other pets, such as cats and rodents, provided they are introduced properly and trained to accept each other.
