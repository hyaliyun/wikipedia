Background Munirudeen Adekunle Muse was born on 17 May 1939 in Olowogbowo, Central Lagos. He joined the Nigerian Ports Authority in 1961 as a clerk, and was appointed to progressively more senior positions over the next twenty years. From 1980 to 1984, he was the Nigerian Ports Authority‚Äôs Representative to London. In 1990, he was appointed Traffic Manager of Ro-Ro (roll-on / roll-off) operations, holding this post until 1993 when he was made Ports Manager, Lily Pond Container Terminal, Apapa. He is an Associate of the Chartered Institute of Transport, London and an Associate of the Institute of Traffic Administration, London. In 1998 he joined the Alliance for Democracy (AD), and was elected Executive Chairman of Apapa Local Government Area (LGA) from 1999 until 2002. In 2000, he attended the Mayor's Summit in Berlin, a gathering of mayors of major cities around the world. In 2002 he was appointed Executive Secretary of the Apapa LGA. In February 2004 he ran again for office and was again elected Executive Chairman of the Apapa LGA. Senate career  Lagos State, Nigeria In April 2007, Munirudeen Adekunle Muse ran for the Senate on the Action Congress ticket and was elected for the Lagos Central constituency. He was appointed to committees on States & Local Government, Solid Minerals, Police Affairs, National Planning, Marine Transport, Interior Affairs and Air Force. In December 2008, as Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Defence (Air Force), Adekunle Muse said that the Senate would press the president to provide sufficient funds for the Nigerian Air Force to perform optimally. In April 2009, Munirudeen Adekunle Muse advised President Umaru Yar'Adua to emulate the Lagos State governor, Babatunde Fashola, whom he described as a model of serious, people-oriented governance. He contrasted this with the mediocre performance of the Yar'Adua administration in its first two years. In May 2009, This Day published a mid-term rating of senators. The newspaper rated Munirudeen Muse \\"average\\" on the basis that although he had not sponsored any motions, he had been very effective in his Local Government committee. In October 2009, Yar'Adua named Muse as a member of the Federal Delegation for the 2009 Hajj, led by Senator Mahmud Kanti Bello.

For example, the actions considered rebellious in 1869 were undertaken by Riel as the leader of a government recognized by Canada as in legitimate control of territory that did not belong to Canada; Canada negotiated the Manitoba Act with this government. After these \\"rebellions\\", land speculators and other non-M√©tis effectively deprived the M√©tis of land by exploiting a government program for its purchase, with the government perhaps turning a blind eye. The province of Alberta distributed land to M√©tis in 1938 to correct what it believed to be an inequity, but Saskatchewan and Manitoba have not followed Alberta's lead. Riel was elected three times to the House of Commons for Provencher riding; first, in the general election of 1873, the government subsequently resigned over the Pacific Scandal in November 1873.

According to the four- color theorem, every graph that can be drawn in the plane without edge crossings can have its vertices colored using at most four different colors, so that the two endpoints of every edge have different colors, but according to Gr√∂tzsch's theorem only three colors are needed for planar graphs that do not contain three mutually-adjacent vertices. History The theorem is named after German mathematician Herbert Gr√∂tzsch, who published its proof in 1959. Gr√∂tzsch's original proof was complex. attempted to simplify it but his proof was erroneous.. In 2003, Carsten Thomassen derived an alternative proof from another related theorem: every planar graph with girth at least five is 3-list-colorable. However, Gr√∂tzsch's theorem itself does not extend from coloring to list coloring: there exist triangle-free planar graphs that are not 3-list-colorable.. In 1989, Richard Steinberg and Dan Younger gave the first correct proof, in English, of the dual version of this theorem. In 2012, Nabiha Asghar gave a new and much simpler proof of the theorem that is inspired by Thomassen's work. Larger classes of graphs A slightly more general result is true: if a planar graph has at most three triangles then it is 3-colorable. However, the planar complete graph K4, and infinitely many other planar graphs containing K4, contain four triangles and are not 3-colorable. In 2009, Dvo≈ô√°k, Kr√°ƒæ, and Thomas announced a proof of another generalization, conjectured in 1969 by L. Havel: there exists a constant d such that, if a planar graph has no two triangles within distance d of each other, then it can be colored with three colors.. This work formed part of the basis for Dvo≈ô√°k's 2015 European Prize in Combinatorics.. The theorem cannot be generalized to all nonplanar triangle-free graphs: not every nonplanar triangle-free graph is 3-colorable. In particular, the Gr√∂tzsch graph and the Chv√°tal graph are triangle-free graphs requiring four colors, and the Mycielskian is a transformation of graphs that can be used to construct triangle-free graphs that require arbitrarily high numbers of colors. The theorem cannot be generalized to all planar K4-free graphs, either: not every planar graph that requires 4 colors contains K4. In particular, there exists a planar graph without 4-cycles that cannot be 3-colored.. Factoring through a homomorphism A 3-coloring of a graph G may be described by a graph homomorphism from G to a triangle K3. In the language of homomorphisms, Gr√∂tzsch's theorem states that every triangle-free planar graph has a homomorphism to K3. Naserasr showed that every triangle-free planar graph also has a homomorphism to the Clebsch graph, a 4-chromatic graph. By combining these two results, it may be shown that every triangle-free planar graph has a homomorphism to a triangle-free 3-colorable graph, the tensor product of K3 with the Clebsch graph. The coloring of the graph may then be recovered by composing this homomorphism with the homomorphism from this tensor product to its K3 factor. However, the Clebsch graph and its tensor product with K3 are both non-planar; there does not exist a triangle-free planar graph to which every other triangle-free planar graph may be mapped by a homomorphism., Theorem 11; . Geometric representation A result of combines Gr√∂tzsch's theorem with Scheinerman's conjecture on the representation of planar graphs as intersection graphs of line segments. They proved that every triangle-free planar graph can be represented by a collection of line segments, with three slopes, such that two vertices of the graph are adjacent if and only if the line segments representing them cross. A 3-coloring of the graph may then be obtained by assigning two vertices the same color whenever their line segments have the same slope. Computational complexity Given a triangle-free planar graph, a 3-coloring of the graph can be found in linear time.. For earlier work on algorithms for this problem, see .

This time, another individual, Peter Subbaiah, who ran the Good Samaritan Evangelical and Social Welfare Association, was also implicated. The primary accusation concerned buying babies from a tribal group called the Lambada. The Lambada were a traditionally nomadic people, now settled into hamlets (called tandas) and surviving primarily through subsistence farming and farm labor, often under conditions of severe poverty. The Lambada had previously practiced the custom of a bride price, but had adopted the culturally predominant Indian dowry system, which requires the family of the bride to pay a substantial sum to the groom‚Äôs family in order to arrange her marriage. In addition, the Lambada were said to believe that the third, sixth, and ninth child was, if a girl, ‚Äúinauspicious.‚Äù They were allegedly prone both to female infanticide, and also to selling, for very modest sums, some of their female infants. Press accounts in India referred to their ‚Äúfair complexion‚Äù as making them more attractive to foreign parents, although it is not clear whether this reflected Indian, rather than American, prejudices. The 1999 scandals began with the arrest of two women who were alleged to be acting as scouts or intermediaries in the purchase of children. Although some reports styled these women as ‚Äúsocial workers,‚Äù they were charged with buying Lambada infants for relatively small sums ($15 to $45), and then receiving significantly larger sums ($220 to $440) from the orphanages for the children. Press reports indicated that the orphanages received $2000 to $3000 for each child placed in intercountry adoption. As a result of the 1999 scandals, Sanjeeva Rao and Peter Subbaiah were arrested and placed in prison.\\"\\"The Two Faces of Intercountry Adoption: The Significance of the Indian Adoption Scandals\\" Seton Hall Law Review Thirty-Five.Number Two (2005): 403-493.

The organization was founded by Doc Hendley in 2007. History The idea for Wine To Water was born with the first fundraiser being held in Raleigh, North Carolina in early 2004. The founder, Doc Hendley was a bartender in Raleigh, and had a strong desire utilize the bar and nightclub industry as a way to bring about positive change in the world. After becoming aware of the world's water crisis, Doc held fundraisers at wine tastings and bars in the Raleigh area. The funds from the events would be used to implement clean water projects around the world. The projects financed include digging and repairing wells, supplying areas with filtration systems and storage containers, and educating locals on how to maintain fresh water supplies. Nearly one billion people worldwide lack access to clean water,https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/jmp_report_7_10_lores.pdf and roughly 3.5 million people die each year because of water related issues. Almost half of these deaths are attributed to diarrhea. Wine To Water has expanded greatly recently, and is currently working on water projects in Sudan, India, Cambodia, Uganda, Ethiopia, Peru, and Kenya. Wine To Water is based in Boone, North Carolina, and has clean water projects running in multiple international locations. Wine To Water has received a great deal of media attention on the local, national, and international levels. Doc Hendley was selected by CNN as a top ten finalist for the 2012 CNN Heroes. As of 2009, Wine To Water had implemented sustainable drinking water initiatives to over 25,000 individuals. By October 2014, Wine To Water had expanding to include projects in 18 countries on four continents, supplying clean water to over 300,000 individuals. Projects Well being dug in Trujillo, Peru Sudan Wine To Water‚Äôs work in Sudan includes on rehabilitating wells, delivering water to war-torn regions, and installing a water system they constructed for an orphanage located in the capital. Doc and his organization have provided relief for locations in the Sudan that have been deemed unsafe for humanitarian work. India A leper colony located on the outskirts of New Delhi lacked access to clean water. WTW has installed a new running water system for this colony. Cambodia Cambodia is a country surrounded by water, yet most of the citizens lack access to clean water. Roughly of the deaths in Cambodia can be attributed to a lack of clean water. One focus of Wine To Water in Phnom Penh, is to supply Bio Sand filters for the residences and communities that do not have access to clean water. The primary focus, however, is the drilling of new water wells for communities. As of October, 2009, WTW has drilled over 70 wells for the people of Cambodia. Using local supplies and hand pumps, WTW is able to cut the cost of drilling a well to one fifth the original cost. Uganda Work in Uganda is focused on several areas: first is the distribution of Bio-Sand filters, second is the training of local persons to manufacture their own filters, lastly the formation of training centers around the country to educate the citizens about how to clean water and the importance of this process. Doc (right) checking out a water tank placed on a roof in Peru Peru Wine To Water's work in Peru is currently centered in Trujillo. Water projects underway as of 2009 include hand digging wells, as well as supplying households, orphanages and daycares with a water pumping and storage system to ensure clean water for the community. Individual filtration systems are being distributed in additional areas exposed to contaminated water sources. Haiti In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Wine To Water responded by partnering with Filter Pure to distribute 500 ceramic water filters. The filters provide clean water for a family of 10 for up to five years. Along with Filter Pure, Wine To Water has also begun to build a Haitian run ceramic filter factory to ensure clean water will continue to get to those who need it most.

Mills, Department of Urban Planning, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ. Proceedings of the 1998 National Planning Conference. AIC Press. 1998. The two residential communities exist side-by-side along the fringes in urban Ponce. Compared to other nearby communities San Anton steadfastly clings to its traditions. History The 1950s introduced a period of economic transformation, and the emergence of the Ponce middle class. The era was characterized by the transition from agricultural capitalism to industrial capitalism. Immediately following World War II, the federal government encouraged the growth of industries, highways and development infrastructure, mass-produced single family homes and urban sprawl in Ponce and the rest of Puerto Rico. The rural agricultural lands that once encircled San Anton were rapidly absorbed and behind was left but a skeleton of the community that this neighborhood once was. San Anton is often referred to as the \\"barrio of the freed slaves.\\" The barrio houses the remaining progeny of the largest concentration of freed blacks in southern Puerto Rico. Surnames there such as Roque,Cabrera, Franceschi, Tricoche, Arce and Oppenheimer link the predominantly black residents of this barrio to their 19th century European and Creole \\"estate owners.\\" The barrio is located in close proximity to what were sugar cane fields and three major central sugar mills, Mercedita,Hacienda La Fe, and Hacienda Teresa. When the enslaved peoples received their freedom in 1873, the former masters passed on land rights to some residents; while others migrated to San Anton from nearby municipalities or distant Caribbean islands. Besides its working class contributions, San Anton is recognized nationally and internationally for its contributions to the development of the Puerto Rican popular music of Bomba and Plena. Over the years, the community also offered up a disproportionate number of accomplished artists, athletes and popular hero(ine)s. By the early 1960s, however, pivotal political decisions gave way to a massive \\"development\\" program, which encouraged the disintegration of the larger San Anton barrio and produced a decline in its cultural production. Most of the residents were displaced to newly constructed housing projects, while others migrated north to the San Juan Metropolitan center or to New York City. Transition Street sign on Isabel la Negra Street in Barrio San Ant√≥n The remnants of the San Anton of old were described in the 1960s as \\"dilapidated wooden houses shielded with scraps of galvanized sheeting, crooked alleys, abandoned open spaces, stagnant water\\" and other such phrases. By 1992, the area's zoning was changed from medium density residential zoning (R-3), to the category of \\"Conceptual Development/ Redevelopment Area\\". This change implied a shift from medium density residential (no retail businesses) to an open category that allowed for commercial, industrial, residential, or combined land use. A connector road was scheduled to pass through the community, in order to connect the regional highway network to nearby vacant lands. One author notes that given these changes, it was obvious that time and development had placed the residents of this barrio in a position of no return. \\"Regional infrastructural expansion, the potential increase in area property values, the community's proximity to the central business district and major transportation routes, the area's mature landscape, and relatively undeveloped lands are sure to encourage speculation and future commercial development.\\"The Revitalization of Historic San Anton: A Preservation Study. By Wanda I. Mills & Gaetan Rosario. San Juan: The University of Puerto Rico, Graduate School of Planning, 1993. Page 30 The 'Ponce en Marcha' plan In the early 1990s the city of Ponce was undergoing a massive revitalization program, known as \\"Ponce en Marcha.\\" The \\"Ponce en Marcha\\" plan sought to recuperate the Ponce's urban center, and restore the architectural qualities of the city's golden age of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The program encompassed the historic zone, transportation routes, tourism, and improvements to the urban infrastructure. The city also targeted several low- income communities for revitalization. These included the popular neighborhoods of Arenas de Betances (at Mayor Street) and 25 de Enero Street. Although, the San Anton neighborhood was also programmed for revitalization, a question of legitimacy quickly arose, questioning whether San Anton had revitalization merit. \\"The municipal government proposed to \\"align\\" (urbanize) the existing residential structures in San Anton while maintaining the typology of \\"how San Anton appeared in the days of yesteryear.\\"\\"Una Residente Habla,\\" La Perla del Sur, By Jocelyn M. Ortiz. 18‚Äì24 May 1994, Page 12. By allotting individual parcels, the Office of Housing and Community Development reasoned that San Anton would become more efficient and modernized. In reality, this view implied reorganizing San Anton's spatial patterns to suit the administrative interests of the Ponce municipal government. The municipal government was less concerned about the tangible and invisible spatial characteristics of the barrio that encouraged security, social contact, relationships, and the perpetuation of local understandings among its residents. One dissenting urban planner asserted that: \\"It is certain that the San Anton barrio is one of the poorest communities in Ponce, and that it is at an advanced state of physical degradation. However, one cannot overlook the need to conserve the neighborhood's social and urban characteristics. San Anton's 'organic' development patterns have contributed significantly to the community's quality of life which is conserved to this day, and which contemporary urban developments are often unable to achieve\\"Comentarios a la Propuesta de Desarrollo Para la Comunidad Barrio San Anton. Ponce Municipal Planning Office. By Patrick Urbain. 1993. Ponce Municipal Government. Resident complaints Residents revolted against the government's plans for their community. For example, San Anton resident and school teacher Maria Judith Banchs Cabrera described San Anton's spatial and social traditions indicating that every family yard has its own particular characteristics, and way of life, which have developed over the years and that these understandings bypass the findings any sociological report that the municipality may have engaged in. It became clear to the municipal government that if they removed a person from their property, they would be taking them away from their origins, their ancestors, and thus aligning the properties would cause problems. It recognized that most architects did not understand this sociological element.\\"Municipio de Ponce Detalla Plan de Revitalization,\\" By Jocelyn M. Ortiz. La Perla del Sur, 18‚Äì24 May 1994, 12. Today In the end the City had to yield to most resident demands. The residents, for their part, seeing the benefits that revitalization elsewhere in Ponce had brought to those communities conceded to giving it a try also and, by 1998, the neighborhood was revitalized. By 2000 approximately 40 San Anton households moved into their new homes which still conserved the spatial arrangement the residents were used to. New water lines were installed, and street lighting, sidewalks, and cul-de-sac layouts are now an integral part of San Anton.

It designs, produces and markets sofas, armchairs and living room accessories. Natuzzi is Italy's largest furniture house and the company with the greatest global reach in its sector. In 1993, Natuzzi Group became the only foreign furniture company to list on Wall Street. It is headquartered in Santeramo in Colle, Apulia, Italy.http://int.natuzzi.com/53/08/about_us History Pasquale Natuzzi was very young when he started his career. The son of a cabinet-maker, in 1959 at 19 years of age he opened a workshop in Taranto with three collaborators, producing sofas and armchairs for the local market. In 1962 he moved to Matera where he began to gain commercial experience. In 1967, still in Matera, Pasquale Natuzzi returned to the production of sofas and armchairs, this time on an industrial scale. In 1972 he founded Natuzzi Salotti S.r.l. One year later, following a fire that completely destroyed the Matera factory, Pasquale Natuzzi decided to relocate production to Santeramo in Colle (Bari ‚Äì Italy), which is the modern-day headquarter of the Group. Somewhere about the middle of the 1970s, Natuzzi took part for the first time in a furniture fair in Bari. Here started first contacts with customers from the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan. In 1976 Natuzzi exported 60% of the turnover in those countries, while 40% was realized in Italy. The beginning of the 1980s was the turning point in Natuzzi Group's growth. During a trip to the United States, Pasquale Natuzzi spotted an opportunity to carry out a radical change of direction: \\"democratizing\\" the leather sofa, once a product for an elite niche. The first sofa sold at $999 in the United States was a Natuzzi, at Macy's. Following the success in the United States, in 1985 Natuzzi Upholstery Inc. was established. Based in New York, the company was especially designed for the needs of its North American clients. In 1998, further confirmation of the Group's strong ties with the American market was given by the inauguration in High Point, North Carolina, of a futuristic- looking building, designed by the architect Mario Bellini, housing the offices of Natuzzi Americas, with a showroom measuring 8,000 square metres. With North American expansion continuing, the Group then went on to strengthen its presence in Italy and throughout Europe. The 1990s saw the opening in Taranto, on Pasquale Natuzzi's initiative, of the first shop in the franchising chain Divani & Divani by Natuzzi. There are 274 Natuzzi stores worldwide (mainly in Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, France, Switzerland, China, and Australia), and 335 Natuzzi Galleries, mainly in the United States and Northern Europe. Today Pasquale Natuzzi personally oversees strategic activities relating to strengthening the brand with investments in product innovation and research, marketing, communication and staff training, working alongside the Group's managers to define future strategies. Natuzzi products The Group's product offering is divided into three brands. Natuzzi Italia is the \\"made in Italy\\" brand dedicated to the high-end market. The sofas and armchairs of the Natuzzi Italia collection are complemented by a selection of home furnishings, lamps, accessories, and living room furniture. Natuzzi Italia products are distributed through single-brand point of sales: Natuzzi Store and Natuzzi Gallery (shop-in-the-shop) Leather Editions. Natuzzi Editions is the brand that provides a wide range of sofas and armchairs in leather, available in different designs and functions.

Biography Douglas Copland was born in Otago, New Zealand in 1894, the thirteenth of sixteen children. He was raised there and lived there till he was 21. In 1920, at the age of 26, he became Professor of Economics at the University of Tasmania. In 1924 Copland was appointed the Professor of Commerce (a post he held until 1944) and first Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Commerce at the University of Melbourne. He was also the Truby Williams Professor of Economics at the University of Melbourne 1944‚Äì45. He is remembered for his interest in the application of economic analysis to practical problems. Copland helped found the Economic Society of Australia and New Zealand and was the first president of the Victorian Branch of the society and the first Editor in Chief of its journal The Economic Record. It is said of him that he \\"pioneered the development of the economics profession in Australia\\". Amongst other things he was Commonwealth Prices Commissioner during the Second World War and Australian Minister to China (1946‚Äì48). He was appointed the first Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University in 1948, a post he held until 1953 when he became Australian High Commissioner to Canada. He was a member of the Australian Delegation at the first United Nations General Assembly. He was Vice President of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) during its 18th Session (June‚ÄìAugust 1954) and President for the 19th and 20th Sessions (March‚ÄìJune, July‚ÄìOctober 1955). Copland is acknowledged as the founder of the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. In 1960 CEDA was established as one of Australia's first independent think tanks. CEDA's work fostering economic development, public debate and research and policy continues. Copland's legacy is acknowledged through the Copland leadership program run by CEDA in each Australian state and through the CEDA annual Copland lecture. Copland died in 1971.

Explicitly, it is a function that is: * additive with respect to vector addition: T(v+v') = T(v)+T(v') * there exists a field automorphism Œ∏ of K such that T(\\\\lambda v) = \\\\lambda^\\\\theta T(v), where \\\\lambda^\\\\theta is the image of the scalar \\\\lambda under the automorphism. If such an automorphism exists and T is nonzero, it is unique, and T is called Œ∏-semilinear. Where the domain and codomain are the same space (i.e. ), it may be termed a semilinear transformation. The invertible semilinear transforms of a given vector space V (for all choices of field automorphism) form a group, called the general semilinear group and denoted \\\\operatorname{\\\\Gamma L}(V), by analogy with and extending the general linear group. The special case where the field is the complex numbers and the automorphism is complex conjugation, a semilinear map is called an antilinear map. Similar notation (replacing Latin characters with Greek) are used for semilinear analogs of more restricted linear transform; formally, the semidirect product of a linear group with the Galois group of field automorphism. For example, PŒ£U is used for the semilinear analogs of the projective special unitary group PSU. Note however, that it is only recently noticed that these generalized semilinear groups are not well-defined, as pointed out in ‚Äì isomorphic classical groups G and H (subgroups of SL) may have non-isomorphic semilinear extensions. At the level of semidirect products, this corresponds to different actions of the Galois group on a given abstract group, a semidirect product depending on two groups and an action. If the extension is non-unique, there are exactly two semilinear extensions; for example, symplectic groups have a unique semilinear extension, while has two extensions if n is even and q is odd, and likewise for PSU.  Definition  A map for vector spaces and over fields and respectively is -semilinear, or simply semilinear, if there exists a field homomorphism such that for all , in and in it holds that # f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y), # f(\\\\lambda x)=\\\\sigma(\\\\lambda) f(x). A given embedding of a field in allows us to identify with a subfield of , making a -semilinear map a K-linear map under this identification. However, a map that is -semilinear for a distinct embedding will not be K-linear with respect to the original identification , unless is identically zero. More generally, a map between a right -module and a left -module is -semilinear if there exists a ring antihomomorphism such that for all , in and in it holds that # \\\\psi(x + y) = \\\\psi(x) + \\\\psi(y) , # \\\\psi(x \\\\lambda) = \\\\sigma(\\\\lambda) \\\\psi(x) . The term semilinear applies for any combination of left and right modules with suitable adjustment of the above expressions, with being a homomorphism as needed. The pair is referred to as a dimorphism. Related Transpose Let be a ring isomorphism, a right -module and a right -module, and a -semilinear map. We define the transpose of as the mapping that satisfies : \\\\langle y , \\\\psi ( x ) \\\\rangle = \\\\sigma( \\\\langle {}^\\\\text{t} \\\\psi ( y ) , x \\\\rangle) \\\\quad \\\\forall y \\\\in N^{*}, \\\\forall x \\\\in M. This is a -semilinear map. Properties Let be a ring isomorphism, a right -module and a right -module, and a -semilinear map. The mapping : M \\\\to R : x \\\\mapsto \\\\sigma ^{-1} ( \\\\langle y , \\\\psi (x) \\\\rangle) , \\\\quad y \\\\in N^{*} defines an -linear form.  Examples  * Let K=\\\\mathbf{C}, V=\\\\mathbf{C}^n, with standard basis e_1,\\\\ldots, e_n. Define the map f\\\\colon V \\\\to V by *:f\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n z_i e_i \\\\right) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\bar z_i e_i :f is semilinear (with respect to the complex conjugation field automorphism) but not linear. * Let K=\\\\operatorname{GF}(q) ‚Äì the Galois field of order q=p^i, p the characteristic. Let \\\\ell^\\\\theta = \\\\ell^p. By the Freshman's dream it is known that this is a field automorphism. To every linear map f\\\\colon V \\\\to W between vector spaces V and W over K we can establish a \\\\theta-semilinear map *:\\\\widetilde{f} \\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\ell_i e_i\\\\right) := f \\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\ell_i^\\\\theta e_i \\\\right) . :Indeed every linear map can be converted into a semilinear map in such a way. This is part of a general observation collected into the following result. * Let R be a noncommutative ring, M a left R-module, and \\\\alpha an invertible element of R. Define the map \\\\varphi\\\\colon M\\\\to M \\\\colon x \\\\mapsto\\\\alpha x, so \\\\varphi(\\\\lambda u)=\\\\alpha \\\\lambda u = (\\\\alpha \\\\lambda \\\\alpha^{-1}) \\\\alpha u = \\\\sigma(\\\\lambda) \\\\varphi(u), and \\\\sigma is an inner automorphism of R. Thus, the homothety x\\\\mapsto\\\\alpha x need not be a linear map, but is \\\\sigma-semilinear.  General semilinear group  Given a vector space V, the set of all invertible semilinear transformations (over all field automorphisms) is the group ŒìL(V). Given a vector space V over K, ŒìL(V) decomposes as the semidirect product :\\\\operatorname{\\\\Gamma L}(V) = \\\\operatorname{GL}(V) \\\\rtimes \\\\operatorname{Aut}(K) , where Aut(K) is the automorphisms of K. Similarly, semilinear transforms of other linear groups can be defined as the semidirect product with the automorphism group, or more intrinsically as the group of semilinear maps of a vector space preserving some properties. We identify Aut(K) with a subgroup of ŒìL(V) by fixing a basis B for V and defining the semilinear maps: :\\\\sum_{b\\\\in B} \\\\ell_b b \\\\mapsto \\\\sum_{b \\\\in B} \\\\ell_b^\\\\sigma b for any \\\\sigma \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Aut}(K). We shall denoted this subgroup by Aut(K)B. We also see these complements to GL(V) in ŒìL(V) are acted on regularly by GL(V) as they correspond to a change of basis.  Proof  Every linear map is semilinear, thus \\\\operatorname{GL}(V) \\\\leq \\\\operatorname{\\\\Gamma L}(V). Fix a basis B of V. Now given any semilinear map f with respect to a field automorphism , then define by :g \\\\left(\\\\sum_{b \\\\in B} \\\\ell_b b\\\\right) := \\\\sum_{b \\\\in B}f \\\\left(l_b^{\\\\sigma^{-1}} b\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{b \\\\in B} \\\\ell_b f (b) As f(B) is also a basis of V, it follows that g is simply a basis exchange of V and so linear and invertible: . Set h:=f g^{-1}. For every v=\\\\sum_{b \\\\in B} \\\\ell_b b in V, :hv=fg^{-1}v=\\\\sum_{b \\\\in B} \\\\ell_b^\\\\sigma b thus h is in the Aut(K) subgroup relative to the fixed basis B. This factorization is unique to the fixed basis B. Furthermore, GL(V) is normalized by the action of Aut(K)B, so .  Applications   Projective geometry  The \\\\operatorname{\\\\Gamma L}(V) groups extend the typical classical groups in GL(V). The importance in considering such maps follows from the consideration of projective geometry. The induced action of \\\\operatorname{\\\\Gamma L}(V) on the associated projective space P(V) yields the ', denoted \\\\operatorname{P\\\\Gamma L}(V), extending the projective linear group, PGL(V). The projective geometry of a vector space V, denoted PG(V), is the lattice of all subspaces of V. Although the typical semilinear map is not a linear map, it does follow that every semilinear map f\\\\colon V \\\\to W induces an order-preserving map f\\\\colon \\\\operatorname{PG}(V) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{PG}(W). That is, every semilinear map induces a projectivity. The converse of this observation (except for the projective line) is the fundamental theorem of projective geometry. Thus semilinear maps are useful because they define the automorphism group of the projective geometry of a vector space.  Mathieu group  The group PŒìL(3,4) can be used to construct the Mathieu group M24, which is one of the sporadic simple groups; PŒìL(3,4) is a maximal subgroup of M24, and there are many ways to extend it to the full Mathieu group.

He was a 1992 recipient of a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and a 2003 recipient of the Alabama Folk Heritage Award. His numerous showings included the 1984 Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife with his uncle, potter Gerald Stewart. Biography Brown is a ninth generation traditional potter, the son of Horace Vincent \\"Jug\\" Brown and Hattie Mae Stewart Brown. He learned his art in childhood but had to give it up following the deaths of his older brother Jack and his father in 1964 and 1965. He worked in logging for nearly twenty years but then aided by his wife Sandra, his uncle Gerald Stewart and other family members was able to return to art in the early 1980s, building his studio from an old barn. Gerald in particular helped him re-learn techniques he had forgotten during the years in logging and it was Gerald who went with him to the Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife. Sandra and Jerry continued to work together throughout his life. Jeff Wilburn, his stepson, worked with them and was trained as a full-time potter.http://www.folkstreams.net/context,9 Folkstreams Unbroken Traditions article Sandra is responsible for much of the glazing, finishing and marketing, as well as much of the sculpture of the faces on the face jugs.

However much of his critical acclaim centered on recognition of his unique style of whimsical art, especially face jugs. (According to his mother he had learned the basics of whimsical pottery making from his father, as the Stewarts did not have a face jug tradition.) Despite use of some modern equipment such as an electric kiln for firing some types of glazes and use of powered throwing wheels, he continued to use traditional methods such as digging his own clay, maintaining a mule to power his pug mill and firing most of his work in a brick kiln. Other Brown family traditions include the use of a chicken feather to apply some of the glazing patterns, the use of broken pots for teeth in the face jugs, the practice of a two piece method for large vessels and the use of wheel and handshaping techniques for complex pieces instead of slip casting.

Biography Early life Essman was born on September 19, 1966 and grew up on Long Island. In 1984 he went to college at Hobart in Geneva, New York. In 1986 he transferred to the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he studied psychology, screenwriting, and film criticism. Movie career In 1987, Essman's camera teacher was future director Jay Roach and in 1988, before graduating, he performed standup comedy in a show at USC's Cafe '84 hosted by future writer-director Judd Apatow and also featured actor Mark Christopher Lawrence. After returning to New York in 1988, Essman formed Visionary Cinema, an eclectic artists group that was formed with a mixture of unproduced writers, performers, 2D artists, and filmmakers. When NYC proved unfruitful for Essman and Visionary Cinema, both he and the company relocated to Los Angeles. At that time, Essman wrote the screenplays KRAZY-TV, Rodeo Drive, and Candyland and made the rounds. There were a few bites but no buyers. Career in Journalism Switching to journalism, Essman was first published in Cinefex Magazine in 1996 with a story about makeup legend Michael Westmore. Essman has published over 400 articles as a freelancer for outlets also including The Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Design, The American Cinema Editors' magazine, The CinemaEditor, Creative Screenwriting, MovieMaker, Acted By, Below the Line News, Fangoria, plus several Internet sites dealing with filmmaking, especially in the science-fiction and horror genres. In 1998, Essman established Directed By: The Cinema Quarterly, a periodical that strictly focused on the craft of movie directors and directing. Seven issues were published, printed, and distributed. In February 1996, Essman and his team documented a weekend-long creature effects film called Wolvy. It was eventually made into a 24-minute documentary and a two- minute music video from the doc was uploaded to YouTube, with over 64,000 individual views as of Halloween, 2009. Also in 1996, Essman created his first special live event, a tribute to the makeup artist, Dick Smith. Created at the Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn in North Hollywood, the event was decorated with original posters of Smith's films and was attended by 40 of Smith's closest prot√©g√©s, friends, and colleagues and included film footage of Smith's work, interviews, and tributes to Smith by all in attendance. In 1998, Essman created a 30-minute highlights video of the event. Events in 1997 (A Tribute to John Chambers and Planet of the Apes) and 1998 (A Tribute to The Wizard of Oz) ensued and doubled each year in attendance. In June 2000, Essman recruited 16 actors plus a team of production designers, lighting designers, makeup artists and costume designers to create Jack Pierce - The Man Behind The Monsters, which was a staged multimedia play with a 48-page unique commemorative program. In 2004, Essman created a tribute to silent film star Lon Chaney at Universal Studios' CityWalk. In 2009, he created a tribute to the Westmores of Hollywood at the Monsterpalooza convention in Burbank, CA. Work for Universal Studio In 2002, noting that \\"if you can't beat them, join them,\\" Essman started working for Universal Studios as a writer and publicist of classic monster films. As of late 2009, he produced over 25 publicity projects for Universal Studios Home Entertainment where he made video documentaries about filmmakers, co-produced special live events, and wrote publicity materials and interviewed movie craftspeople, including directors Peter Jackson (King Kong - 2005), Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead), and David Twohy (The Chronicles of Riddick) and produced documentaries about the visual effects of The Incredible Hulk and the stunt work in The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.Interviews ¬´ SCARS ‚Äì The horror magazine that leaves marks!

In a short career of six years, Shoalwater was renamed Fenix, Franklin, and Minnie Holmes.Wright, E.W., Lewis & Dryden Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, pp. 57-58, Lewis & Dryden Publishing, Portland, OR 1895 Shoalwater was the first steamboat in Oregon to suffer a boiler explosion, although no fatalities resulted. Construction Shoalwater was built in 1852 by Leonard White at Canemah, a small settlement just above Willamette Falls. Her first owners were McCarver and Son, who were merchants in Oregon City.Corning, Willamette Landings, pp. 63, 72, 87, 119. Leonard White and others may have had ownership interests in the vessel. Shoalwater was fitted with two geared engines, of which historian Corning said \\"generated more noise than power\\". Shoalwater, as her name indicated, was designed to run when all other boats were compelled to lay up for lack of water on the sand and gravel bars that often blocked river navigation. Mechanical failure and renaming as Fenix Leonard White (d.1870). On April 30, 1853, while Shoalwater was making a landing below Rock Island near Butteville on the Willamette River between Champoeg and Canemah, the steam ran up too fast, causing a flue to collapse. Several persons received injuries, none of which, however, resulted seriously. The accident proved so expensive that the vessel changed ownership and name, this time to Fenix (the owners' method of spelling Phoenix).  Reaching the head of navigation  Fenix became part of the short-lived Defiance Line, which made daily runs south from Canemah with the steamers Wallamet and Canemah. During this time, Capt. Leonard White, who was considered one of the most intrepid of all steamboat captains of the time,Timmen, Blow for the Landing, pp. 141‚Äì142. took Fenix up the Willamette River to Harrisburg, which was further upriver then any steamboat had yet been run, and well above Corvallis, which was the presumed head of navigation at the time. Fenix is also recorded as having taken Independence Day celebrants out from Champoeg for a three-mile (5 km) excursion cruise on July 4, 1854.Mills, Sternwheelers up Columbia, pp. 53, 54, 114‚Äì15 Operations on Yamhill River Captain White sold Fenix to Captain Hereford, who with others in the Willamette Falls Company was trying to organize a steamboat line. Hereford put Fenix on the run from Canemah up the Willamette and then the Yamhill River to Lafayette. Hereford was competing with the larger steamer Oregon and once tried to pass Oregon on a narrow stretch of the river. The vessels collided, and Oregon shoved Fenix out of the way. The Willamette Falls Company decided to sell Fenix and replace her with a steamer then under construction at Canemah. (That steamer was never launched, having burned on the ways when almost complete.) Sale to Citizens' Accommodation Line Fenix was sold and again renamed, as Franklin and was run by the Citizens' Accommodation Line in company with Canemah. Three times a week Franklin made trips from Canemah to Salem, stopping at the many landings along the way. In February 1855, Franklin was advertised as making daily trips to Champoeg, Oregon and intermediate points, and would make through trips to Corvallis during the winter. Franklin was then running under the command of S.C. Alexander. Franklin was later lengthened and renamed Minnie Holmes, in honor of a young woman of Oregon City. In May 1857, Minnie Holmes was running under the command of Capt. Leonard White, who had a reputation as a popular man which could help the boat financially. (Minnie Holmes later married Dan O' Neill, who in 1850 had been a captain of Columbia, the first steamboat built in the Oregon Territory. O'Neill later became a long-term steamboat purser.) Conversion to sawmill Shoalwater was unable to earn money under any name, and so in 1858 sold her to B. N. Du Rell, by whom she was taken to Salem and fitted up as a floating sawmill. The machinery was subsequently removed and permanently located on the bank of the river, where it was used in the manufacture of lumber until 1860, at which time the mill was destroyed by fire.

It is written by Brett Lewis, whose previous work includes The Winter Men, and is illustrated by several members of Imaginary Friends Studios. The first issue was published by Image Comics on September 2, 2009. The story is about androids with artificial intelligence in a futuristic Los Angeles. It has been compared to Pinocchio and Pygmalion. Plot The plot is \\"inspired by the ideas & lyrics of Fall Out Boy\\", especially the song \\"Tiffany Blews\\" from the album Folie √† Deux. The story focuses on the Toymaker, who despite being a brilliant inventor, finds himself in financial trouble. A rich magnate known as the Baron seeks to have a robotic woman companion, but his team of scientists is unable to create one that behaves realistically. The Baron hires the Toymaker to help advance the process, and he creates a new android named Tiffany. Development Wentz met with designer, Darren Romanelli, to discuss a creative collaboration for Fall Out Boy's musical tour. They decided to base their concept on the song, \\"Tiffany Blews\\". Romanelli then consulted with comics industry member, Nathan Cabrera, together creating a world inspired by the song's lyrics. Wentz, while admittedly \\"not a really big comic guy,\\" approved of the comic series after being shown some storyboards they had drawn. They were introduced to writer Brett Lewis and Imaginary Friends Studios through Romanelli's friend, editor Jeff Krelitz. Wentz, while not directly involved in the writing process, contributed ideas and oversaw the general direction of the comic. They intend to expand the concept into a whole media franchise, including animation and merchandise. In interviews, Wentz talked about the themes discussed in the comic: \\"There's a strong element of, 'What is real? What makes something real? Can you fabricate reality?'\\" \\"It explores the dimensions of what love really is. Can it be designed in you? Can a robot fall in love?\\" He cited Blade Runner as a thematic and visual influence. An animated adaptation, dubbed a \\"motion comic\\", is in production by Double Barrel Motion Labs. A teaser trailer was released online on the day of the first issue's publication. Reception Over 75 people turned up for a comic book signing at a Phoenix, Arizona retailer, Atomic Comics.

He was an All- American end for Harvard University in 1912. After graduating from Harvard, Felton declined a record offer to play Major League Baseball for Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics. Biography Felton attended Harvard University where he played American football at the end position in 1911 and 1912. He also handled punting and kicking duties for Harvard's football team. As a junior in 1911, Felton was one of the leaders of a football team that opened the season 5‚Äì0 while outscoring opponents 72‚Äì6. However, Felton was seriously injured in the first period of the fifth game of the season‚Äîa win over Brown University. Felton was kicked in the side. The New York Times reported that, because Felton was not wearing any protective pads over his hips, the kick broke several blood vessels and formed a clot. Following the injury to Felton, the previously-undefeated Harvard team went 1‚Äì2‚Äì1 in its final four games. Felton returned to the Harvard football team as a senior and helped lead the 1912 team to a perfect 9‚Äì0 record. Felton was regarded as the best punter in the country during the 1912 season, with punts averaging from 60 to 70 yards. Four decades later, sports writer Grantland Rice included Felton on his list of the finest college kickers he had ever seen. Felton and Charley Brickley were \\"credited with having won the intercollegiate championship for the [Harvard] Crimson\\" in 1912. At the end of the 1912 season, Felton was selected as a first-team All-American in 1912 by Walter Camp (for Collier's Weekly), Robert Edgren, W.J. MacBeth, Alfred S. Harvey of the Milwaukee Free Press, Parke H. Davis, and the Trenton Evening Times. Felton of Harvard Felton was also a star pitcher for the Harvard baseball team for three years from 1911‚Äì1913. In May 1913, Felton pitched a one-hit shutout against Amherst College. The New York Times reported on the game as follows: \\"Harvard shut out Amherst, 5 to 0, this afternoon because of the masterful pitching of Sam Felton, the former football end rush and punter. Felton held the visitors to one single, this being made in the first inning by Kimball, Amherst's first batter to face Felton. Kimball's hit was a scratch, being nearly smothered by Capt. Wingate ...\\" Felton's pitching also helped lead Harvard to win the series against Yale in 1913, and the team presented Felton. Upon his graduation from Harvard in 1913, Connie Mack offered Felton a three-year contract to pitch for the Philadelphia Athletics for $15,000 per year. The offer was a record for a collegiate player and was turned down by Felton. Felton declined the offer to return to his home in Haverford, Pennsylvania and pursue a career in business. The Washington Post reported on the offer as follows: > \\"Manager Mack, of the Athletics, usually regarded as one of the most > conservative bidders for ball players, recently made a record offer for a > college player, and, after striving as he has never before done, failed to > gain the coveted contract. This much sought collegian, whom Mack thinks > would have made one of the greatest pitchers In the history of the game, is > Samuel Felton, football and baseball star at Harvard for three years. Within > the past month Mack offered Felton a flat contract of $15,000 for three > years, agreeing to permit him to make his own terms and giving him the > option of an unconditional release should he tire of professional ball, but > the persuasion of the Athletics' manager failed. Felton, who lives at > Haverford, Pa., comes of a wealthy family, and does not have to play ball > for a living, besides being actively engaged in business here.\\" In October 1914, the Harvard baseball team presented Felton with a silver loving cup for his contributions to Harvard's success. On the day before his wedding in October 1913, The New York Times reported that Harvard's undergraduates \\"jammed the Union\\" to give Felton \\"a rousing send-off.\\" In 1921, he was selected to serve on the Harvard baseball team's advisory staff.

Built in 1881, the architecturally eclectic Gothic/Romanesque building was constructed for an Episcopalian church congregation founded in 1872, which is believed to be the oldest in Limestone. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Architecture and building history The Church of the Advent is a modest wood frame building, with a distinctive steeply gabled roof and a small tower just to the left of the main block. The main (west-facing) facade has two tall and narrow round-headed windows, with the main entrance in a rounded opening in the tower. A narrow rectangular window is above the doorway in the tower, with an open belfry above, capped by a pyramidal roof. Behind the sanctuary is a wider modern single-story addition built of concrete blocks, with a shallow-pitch gable roof. The interior (walls and barrel-vaulted ceiling) are finished in stained tongue-and-groove woodwork, although early accounts describe the church ceiling as having been plastered. Surviving original features include wall-mounted oil lamps. The Episcopal congregation that built the church in 1881 was founded in 1872, and is believed to be Limestone's first organized church group. It originally met in a school before having this building built. The building was originally located on the Grand Falls Road where the Protestant Cemetery continues to stand. The church was moved on log rollers, using horses to its present location over several months in 1896. It was reported in 1904 that its tower had been raised to accommodate the belfry.

The Gothic Revival wood frame church, built in 1912-14 for a Methodist congregation founded in 1860, is the most architecturally sophisticated church in Caribou. It was built on the lot of the Colonial Revival parsonage house, which was moved to make way for the church. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The current pastor is Rev. Timothy Wilcox. Description and history The Gray Memorial United Methodist Church is set on a grassy level lot at the corner of Prospect and Sweden Streets in downtown Caribou. The building is an L-shaped wood frame structure, with a multistage tower at the crook of the L. The facade facing Sweden Street has a large central gable with three lancet- arched windows, the central one larger than those flanking it, and an oriel window above. The main entrance is in the tower, which is slightly recessed from the facade and sheltered by a gable-roof hood. A secondary entrance is located to the left of the gable, and there is a porte-cochere to the right, supported by square posts set on stone piers. The Prospect street facade also has a primary entrance in the tower, with two secondary entrances on the large gable to the right. The gable has one large centered lancet-arch window with an oriel window above, and a smaller lancet-arch window to the left. The tower's second and third levels both have short lancet-arch windows, one on the second level and three on the third. Above the third level is a flared roofline, above which is an open belfry with paired lancet-arch openings, and a pyramidal roof above with an embedded clock.

It is based on a \\"combination plan\\", uniting the ideas behind the \\"auditorium plan\\" and \\"Akron Plan\\" that were popularized after the American Civil War. The interiors have decorative metal walls and ceilings, and cypress flooring. The stained glass windows were manufactured by Spence, Bell and Company of Boston, Massachusetts, and the tower clock is by Seth Thomas. The parsonage house, constructed in 1906, is a Colonial Revival structure with a hip roof with dormers, and a wraparound porch. The current parsonage c. 1906-1911 The Methodist congregation in Caribou was established in 1860 with circuit ministers, and built its first sanctuary on an adjacent property in 1885. Having outgrown that space, it purchased the house next door, moved it back for use as the parsonage, and built the present sanctuary in 1912-14. The church was named in honor of Bessie Gray, the pastor's wife who was instrumental in the process of building the new facility.

Rodrigo Gonz√°lez de Lara (floruit 1078‚Äì1143) was a Castilian nobleman of the House of Lara. Early in his career he ruled that half of Asturias allocated to Castile. He was faithful to the crown throughout the reign of Queen Urraca (1109‚Äì26), during which time he was married to the queen's half-sister and ruled a large part of the old County of Castile. He and his elder brother, Pedro Gonz√°lez, led the opposition to Alfonso VII early in his reign (1126‚Äì57). He led a revolt in 1130 and was exiled in 1137. He was a leader in the Reconquista‚Äîabout which the contemporary Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris has much to say‚Äîand also took part in the military activities of the Crusader states on two occasions. He travelled widely throughout Spain, but ended his days in Palestine. Youth under Alfonso VI (1078‚Äì1112) Rodrigo was a son of Gonzalo N√∫√±ez de Lara and Godo N√∫√±ez, and kinsman of Gonzalo Salvad√≥rez.Barton (1997), 292‚Äì93. Rodrigo's inheritance was modest.For a map of his patrimony, cf. Doubleday (2001), 24. A certain Rodrigo Gonz√°lez who was alf√©rez (standard-bearer) of Alfonso VI between 29 January 1078 and 9 June 1081 may have been Rodrigo Gonz√°lez de Lara.Reilly (1988), 138, but Barton (1997), 292 n1, is sceptical. If so, he was a very old man when he died. The alf√©rez did sign the carta de arras (charter of bridewealth) of Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar, El Cid Campeador, in 1080/1.Reilly (1988), 83, uses his signature to disprove the thesis of Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal that the surviving copy of this charter is an original. Its purported date, 10 July 1074, is definitely in error. A Rodrigo Gonz√°lez who signed eight royal diplomas between 1092 and 1099 has also been identified with the alf√©rez, the son of Gonzalo N√∫√±ez, and the later Crusader.Reilly (1988), 278. Governing the Asturias (1112‚Äì1130) Rodrigo Gonz√°lez de Lara first appears holding a fief (tenencia) from the crown on 29 February 1112, when he was governing all the Cantabrian region south of the river Miera, the valley of Mena, and Asturias de Santillana, formerly held by his cousin Rodrigo Mu√±oz.Potestate [power holder] in Mera et in Asturias Rodrigo Gonsalvez, cf. Barton (1982), 283. By 1119 he was ruling the Trasmiera, the region north of the Miera, which up until then had also been held by Rodrigo Mu√±oz. He is not recorded there after 1120, by which time his rule had extended westward over Aguilar de Campoo.Barton (1997), 292‚Äì93; Reilly (1982), 283, does not know about his rule in Aguilar before 26 March and 1 November 1125. At the same time he first appeared as governing \\"in Castile\\" (in castella), probably a reference to Old Castile; certainly he was not governing all of Castile. There are references to a \\"Count Rodrigo\\" governing Castile as early as 9 May 1112, but this may be Rodrigo Mu√±oz.Barton (1982), 283. By 13 April 1121 Rodrigo was a count. In 1122 he made a donation to the Benedictine monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Piasca. Sometime before 1122 Rodrigo married Sancha (born c.1101), a daughter of Alfonso VI and his fourth wife Isabel.Barton (1997), 292; Reilly (1982), 216‚Äì17. Luisa Garc√≠a Calles dated the marriage to 1118 at the latest, but without citing evidence. She bore him three daughters: Elvira, Sancha, and Urraca. Collegiate Church of Santillana del Mar, a Romanesque structure dating from Rodrigo's time. He made Santillana his headquarters during his rebellion in 1130. Rodrigo confirmed a total of fifteen royal charters during Urraca's reign.Reilly (1982), 216. It was during the final six years of Urraca's reign, a period of general peace, that Rodrigo held power in the Kingdom of Le√≥n. As early as 1120 he was governing Li√©bana, and by 1122 he was also governing N√°ngulo, Piedras Negras, and the Tierra de Campos. By 1125 he was ruling Pern√≠a as well. A private document dated 17 June 1126 refers to both Rodrigo and Pedro as holding Lara, Campos, and Asturias de Santillana, seemingly jointly.Reilly (1998), 18 n13. Their rule in none of these places can be traced after Urraca's death.The last record from Li√©bana dates to 1125 and from Campos to 1126, cf. Barton, 292‚Äì93. On 10 May 1125 at Sahag√∫n, Rodrigo and the queen made a joint donation of the monastery at Vega to the Order of Fontevraud.Reilly (1982), 196‚Äì97. His wife Sancha was dead by that time, and Urraca, their youngest daughter, was put in the custody of Sancha Raim√∫ndez, the king's sister.Barton (1997), 48‚Äì49, says that this happened when she was orphaned. Rebellion against Alfonso VII (1130‚Äì1131) There is a false document dated 18 April 1125 that names Rodrigo Gonz√°lez as villicus imperatoris, that is, imperial majordomo.Reilly (1982), 199 n69. Among the errors in this document are the early use of the imperial title and the name of the Bishop of Astorga, then Alo, given as Pedro. After the queen's death on 8 March 1126, the \\"towers of Le√≥n\\", that is, the royal fortress in the city of Le√≥n, refused to submit to her son, Alfonso VII, preferring the rule of Pedro Gonz√°lez, who had been the queen's lover, and his brother Rodrigo, whom the author of the Chronica Adefonsi (I, ¬ß3) says \\"preferred war rather than peace with the King\\".Reilly (1982), 201. Eventually the brothers were forced to make submission to Alfonso VII and did not do so willingly, as the other magnates: > Other counts saw that the King's power was increasing daily. They were the > Castilians, Pedro de Lara and his brother, Rodrigo Gonz√°lez, who lived in > Asturias de Santillana. Gimeno √ç√±iguez was also present. He governed Coyanza > in the territory of Le√≥n. They were indeed frightened; and, as such, they > directed their attention toward arranging a peace conference. However, their > treaty with the King was made in a most insincere manner. Actually they > preferred to follow the King of Arag√≥n.Chronica Adefonsi (I, ¬ß6), quoted in > Barton (1997), 127 n135: At Castellani consules Petrus de Lara et frater > eius Rodericus Gunsalui, qui morabantur in terra quam dicunt Asturias de > Sancta Iuliana, et Semenus Enequi, qui tenebat Coyancam in partibus > Legionis, uires regis de die in diem excrescere uidentes ualde timuerunt et > nolentes et uolentes ad regem, ut secum de pace conloquerentur, attendentes > ficto animo propter regem Aragonensem, quem dilegebant, tamen cum eo > pacificauerunt. In 1127 he sold an estate at Arce to the parish of Santillana del Mar. There is evidence, in the former of a thirteenth-century copy of a private charter, that Alfonso tried to lure Rodrigo to his side by making him alf√©rez in the winter of 1127‚Äì28.Reilly (1998), 25. Despite their earlier submission, Pedro, Rodrigo, and their allies refused to join the army Alfonso assembled at Atienza in 1129 to fight Alfonso I of Aragon and Navarre.Chronica Adefonsi, I, ¬ß14 and II, ¬ß114. The king then relieved Rodrigo of his post as alf√©rez, replacing him with Pedro Alf√≥nsez.Reilly (1998), 31. Early in 1130 he rebelled against the king. The rebellion seems to have been designed to place on the throne Fernando P√©rez de Lara, Rodrigo's nephew, an illegitimate son of Pedro Gonz√°lez and Queen Urraca. It had the support of Alfonso of Aragon and of his agent in Castile, Bertr√°n de Risnel, son-in-law of Pedro. While Pedro and Bertr√°n took the city of Palencia, and another relative of Rodrigo's, Jimeno √ç√±iguez, rebelled at Valencia de Don Juan, Rodrigo took up arms in Asturias de Santillana, the northwestern part of Castile. A minor noble, Pedro D√≠az, rebelled from his castle of Valle. He was put down by the brothers Osorio and Rodrigo Mart√≠nez. By June the king had retaken Palencia and captured Pedro and Bertr√°n.For the revolt of 1130, cf. Barton (1997), 113‚Äì14 and the Chronica Adefonsi, I, ¬ß¬ß18‚Äì23. Having dealt with the other rebels, Alfonso turned to Asturias, where \\"he captured their fortified castles, set fire to their fields and hacked down their trees and vineyards.\\"Chronica Adefonsi, I, ¬ß22. Forced to sue for peace, Rodrigo sent envoys requesting a meeting with the king on the banks of the Pisuerga. Per the agreement Rodrigo and Alfonso would each be accompanied by only six of their knights. During the meeting the king became so enraged by Rodrigo's \\"disrespectful remarks\\" that he seized him by the throat and they both fell from their horses. At this Rodrigo's retinue fled and the count was taken \\"as if he were a common prisoner.\\" Rodrigo found his castles and tenencias confiscated, with Asturias placed in the hands of Rodrigo G√≥mez. There is a record of a comitem Rodericum Gundisalui de Asturias (\\"count Rodrigo Gonz√°lez of Asturias\\") present on 3 November 1140 at the hearing of a dispute between the Bishop of Burgos, Ramiro, and the Bishop of Calahorra, Sancho, in the presence of the king, but it is probably unreliable. It is unlikely that Rodrigo ever regained his place in eastern Asturias. Within a few days of his being released (only after all his castles and fiefs had been received by the king), Rodrigo returned to acknowledge his crimes and seek mercy, which he received by the end of 1131, when he was appointed alcaide of Toledo in place of Gutierre Arm√≠ldez, who had died.Fletcher (1984), 269‚Äì70. Frontier rule (1131‚Äì1137) Gold Almoravid dinars like this one of Ali ibn Yusuf must have formed a substantial part of the booty Rodrigo returned from his major raiding expedition with in 1132. Rodrigo \\"waged numerous wars against the Moors. He killed many and took many prisoners. He also carried away large quantities of booty from their lands.\\"Chronica Adefonsi, I, ¬ß23. The author of the Chronica twice states that only a fraction of his military actions are recorded: \\"He had fought many battles in Moorish territory. The military experiences of Rodrigo Gonz√°lez and Rodrigo Fern√°ndez against the Moors were indeed great, but they have not been described in this book.\\"Chronica Adefonsi, I, ¬ß47. And \\"The other battles which the Consul Rodrigo fought with the king of the Almoravides are not recorded in this book.\\"Chronica Adefonsi, II, ¬ß125. Rodrigo's government in Toledo can be traced in the documents between 1132 and 1136, and he was also governor of Segovia in 1133.Doubleday (2001), 29, says that he had previously governed Toledo under Urraca, but this is not mentioned in Barton, 292. The Chronica Adefonsi (I, ¬ß23) records that Alfonso \\"entrusted Toledo to him and extensive territories on the frontier and in Castile\\" and (II, ¬ß119) \\"he was made commander of all troops in Toledo and leader of Extremadura.\\" In June 1132 he gathered the militias of √Åvila, Segovia, Toledo, and \\"the other cities under Toledo's jurisdiction\\" and combined this force of both cavalry and infantry with an even larger army drawb from Castile and Extremadura.Chronica Adefonsi, II, ¬ß¬ß119‚Äì21. He then led them in a raid into Muslim territory, down the valley of the Guadalquivir, devastating the environs of Seville.Barton (1997), 162; Fletcher (1984), 269‚Äì70. The Chronica Adefonsi notes that he \\"cut down the fruit trees\\". He took many captives and a large booty.In the words of the Chronica, II, ¬ß119, \\"gold, silver, costly dresses, herds of horses, mares, asses, bulls, cows and many other varieties of livestock.\\" The Almoravid governor (or king) of Seville, Umar, raised a large army from among his allies and fought Rodrigo in a pitched battle. Rodrigo divided his infantry into two groups, archers and slingers, and placed his bravest men at the front. The second line was composed of the militia of √Åvila, which engaged an Arab wing, and the third of the militia of Segovia, which faced an Almoravid and Andalusion (native) wing. The militia of Toledo and the troops from the Trans- Sierra and Castile were left in reserve at the rear, under the personal command of Rodrigo \\"to reinforce the weak and to bring medical aid to the wounded.\\" Umar was captured and ultimately beheaded.Powers (1987), 30. So important was this battle that it was recorded in three chronicles: the Chronica Adefonsi, the Anales toledanos primeros,The account in the Anales (Fl√≥rez, 388) reads: Entr√≥ el Conde Rodrigo Gonzalvez con gran huest en el Axaraf de Sevilla, √® lidi√≥ con los Moros, √® venciolos, √® mat√≥ al Rey Omar en Azareda Era MCLXX (\\"The Count Rodrigo Gonz√°lez entered with a great host in the Axaraf of Seville, and he fought with the Moors, and he defeated them, and he killed the King Omar in Azareda in the Spanish Era 1170\\"). and the Arabic chronicle of Ibn Idhari (who errs in dating it to 1130). The author of the Chronica, probably bishop Arnaldo of Astorga, quotes from I Maccabees 9 in describing an encounter he evidently considered of biblical proportions (II, ¬ß121): > The battle began as the Saracens shouted and sounded their brazen trumpets > and drums. They uttered cries and invoked Mohammed. The Christians called > out with all their heart to the Lord, to Mary and to Saint James. They > prayed that they would show them mercy and forget the sins of the king and > of their forefathers. Many on both sides fell wounded shortly after the > battle had begun. Rodrigo realized that the King of Sevilla's army was the > stronger. Consequently, all of the bravest warriors joined with Rodrigo and > they attacked. The King of Sevilla fell in the field and died, as did many > of his officers. Rodrigo Gonz√°lez pursued the survivors all the way to the > gates of Sevilla. After picking up the spoils, he began his march back to > the camp. The victory of Rodrigo inspired a contingent from Salamanca to go raiding in the region around Badajoz. Some mulad√≠es, Muslims living under Christian rule, that had fled Rodrigo's camp had given away the Salamancans' position to the Almoravid sultan, Ali ibn Yusuf ben Tashfin, who promptly attacked and defeated it.Chronica Adefonsi, II, ¬ß¬ß122‚Äì23. Despe√±aperros Pass, through which Rodrigo led half the king's army in 1133. In late May 1133 Rodrigo commanded half of the royal army marching out from Toledo.Barton (1997), 174; Fletcher (1984), 269‚Äì70. The army was divided \\"because there was not enough drinking water ... nor was there enough grass to feed the animals.\\"Chronica Adefonsi, I, ¬ß34. Rodrigo led his forces through the Despe√±aperros Pass. The two armies traversed uninhabited territory for fifteen days before meeting before the enemy castle at Galledo. Thereafter the army followed same route as in the previous year: the Guadalquivir valley as far as Seville, but then continued on to Jerez de la Frontera, which was sacked, and C√°diz, whose countryside was terrorised. The army returned to Toledo by late summer with a vast booty of camels, horses, cattle, sheep, and goats. In July 1135 Alfonso gave him and Rodrigo Mart√≠nez some properties confiscated from another rebel, the Asturian Gonzalo Pel√°ez. One historian believes he regained the long lost fief of Asturias de Santiallana at about this time.Doubleday (2001), 29. By July 1135 Rodrigo had contracted a second marriage to Estefan√≠a, daughter of Ermengol V of Urgell and widow of the Castilian magnate Fernando Garc√≠a de Hita.Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n (1989), 126. Estefan√≠a had received a carta de arras from her first husband on 12 November 1119, and she was widowed around 1125. Despite this, on 6 September 1135 Rodrigo praised his new wife for her youth in his carta de arras.Barton (1997), 56. On 7 September 1135 Rodrigo witnessed a donation of the churches of Tovar and Laguna by his eldest daughter, Elvira, and her husband, the brother of his new wife, Ermengol VI of Urgell, to the convent of Santa Mar√≠a de Valladolid.Barton (1996), 91; Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n (1989), 127. Elvira appears in the documentation as Elvira Roderici and Helvira Rouriz down to 28 September 1139. By 24 March 1143, when her father witnessed her husband's will, she was almost certainly dead. Estefan√≠a bore Rodrigo two sons, Pedro and Rodrigo. Exile and wanderings (1137‚Äì1143) On 3 February 1137 Rodrigo made a donation to Segovia Cathedral. Shortly after, for reasons unknown, Rodrigo fell from favour and was exiled. According to at least one manuscript of the Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris, this occurred in October 1134, but documentary evidence seems to indicate that it actually took place in 1137. Of his own accord he surrendered Toledo and the other tenencias he held, which still included Aguilar and Old Castile according to royal documents date as late as 1 April 1137, to the king in person (\\"[he] kissed the King's hand in farewell and [took] leave of his comrades\\").Chronica Adefonsi, I, ¬ß47‚Äì48. He decided to turn his exile into a pilgrimage (\\"he became a pilgrim and crossed the sea of Jerusalem for purpose of prayer\\", in the words of the Chronica),His ita peractis, consul Rodericus peregrinus factus est et abiit trans mare in Hierosolymis causa orationis, quoted in Barton (1997), 212 and n64. visiting Jerusalem and fighting the Muslims in the Holy Land for two years. He reputedly built the castle called Toron (later le Toron des Chevaliers, modern Latrun) facing Ascalon, which was then still in Muslim hands. The Chronica says that he garrisoned it \\"with knights, infantrymen, and provisions, and he gave it to the Knights Templars.\\"Phillips (2007), 249, accepts this account at face value. In the words of the Chronica, I, ¬ß48, quoted in Barton (2000), n35: Comes uero Rodericus Gundisalui, postquam osculatus est manum regis et gentibus et amicis suis ualere dixit, peregre profectus est Hierosilimis, ubi et commisit multa bella cum Sarracenis fecitque quoddam castellum ualde fortissimum a facie Ascalonie, quod dicitur Toron, et muniuit eum ualde militibus et peditibus et escis tradens illud militibus Templi. In 1137 or 1138, Rorgo Fretellus, a canon of the church of Nazareth, dedicated his Description of the Holy Places to Rodrigo.Kedar (2017), 50‚Äì51: Domino Rodrico, Dei gratia Toletano comiti. Monastery of Valbuena founded by Rodrigo's wife Estefan√≠a shortly before his final pilgrimage to Jerusalem, on which she did not accompany him. Rodrigo returned to Spain, via the Adriatic and Italy, in 1139, and, being barred from returning to Castile or his patrimonial lands, sojourned at various courts in the east of the peninsula. He served for a time Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona, who made him lord of Huesca and Jaca between 1139 and 1141.Pascua (2001), 108. He was later in the service of Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez of Navarre and then the Almoravid governor of Valencia, Abengania. The Chronica Adefonsi says that while he only stayed a few days at Valencia, he contracted leprosy (from a \\"Saracen potion\\"). He did briefly return to Castile, where on 8 February 1141 he granted the village of Hu√©rmeces to the Benedictines of Arlanza. He eventually made his way to the Urgell, where on 24 March 1143 he witnessed, as comes Roricus, the final will and testament of his brother-in-law and son-in- law, Count Ermengol VI. His daughter Elvira had probably died by then. Sometime in or after 1143 he returned to the Holy Land, and there he died.For his Crusading career and demise, cf. Barton (1997), 116 and n80. Shortly before her husband's death Estefan√≠a founded a Cistercian monastery at Valbuena de Duero (15 February 1143).Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n (1984), 66‚Äì68. Her sons, unlike the sons of her husband's brother, never rose to as high a rank in the kingdom as their father had. Historian Antonio Su√°rez de Alarc√≥n owned several manuscript fragments of the Chronica, which were used by Enrique Fl√≥rez in amending the first published edition of the text by Francisco de Berganza. Alarc√≥n himself had made extensive used only of those passages relating to Rodrigo Gonz√°lez, since he had established the descent of the Marqueses de Trocifal from him in his Relaciones geneal√≥gicas de la casa de los Marqueses de Trocifal, Condes de Torresvedras (Madrid, 1656).Lipskey (1971), 21.

The congregation was established by Swedish immigrants to the area in 1871, and the Gothic Revival sanctuary was built in 1879-80. In 1896 the church was named in honor of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The church congregation was in 2003 subjected to one of the nation's largest cases of arsenic poisoning, apparently perpetrated by one of its parishioners. Description and history The Gustaf Adolph Lutheran Church is set on the east side of Capitol Hill Road, about north of its junction with New Sweden Road (Maine State Route 161). The church is a single-story wood frame structure whose exterior is finished in stucco. Its windows are uniformly Gothic style lancet-arch windows. It has a two-stage square tower, whose second stage houses a belfry with round-arched louvers. The belfry is topped by an octagonal steeple with a cross at the top. An entrance vestibule with gable roof projects from the front facade, with a double-door topped by a lancet-arched (roughly triangular) stained-glass window. One ell extends southward from the rear of the building, forming Svea Hall, the parish hall, and another smaller one extends east. The interior of the sanctuary is largely white plastered walls, with dark stained pews and painted woodwork. The altar area is separated from the sanctuary by an elliptical carved railing and its rear wall is decorated by a large painting depicting Christ at Gethsemane. The Svea Hall, added in 1912, has pressed metal decorative walls and ceilings. The first Swedish immigrants arrived in the area in 1870, as part of a program by the state to recruit settlers for the remote northern part of the state. These early settlers began Lutheran church services the following year, and in 1874 began planning construction of a church. The main part of the present building was completed in 1880 and dedicated in 1881 as the First Swedish Evangelical Church in Maine. In 1896 it was renamed Gustaf Adolph Lutheran Church after the 17th-century King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. The town of New Sweden was incorporated in 1895. The church parsonage (extensively modified and no longer historically significant) was built in 1886, and the church hall was added in 1911-12. The interior of the church underwent major renovations in 1930, at which time the exterior (which was originally clapboarded) was redone in stucco. The small eastern addition was made in the 1940s. The church received nationwide press coverage in 2003 when sixteen of its parishioners were poisoned, one fatally, by arsenic which had been added to coffee served after a church service. One week later a parishioner committed suicide, leaving a note claiming responsibility for the poisoning and claiming church politics as the reason. Another parishioner died several years later from complications associated with the poisoning.

Built in 1863 and renovated in 1906, it is believed to be the oldest ecclesiastical building in the Fort Fairfield area. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history The Maple Grove Friends Church is set on the west side of United States Route 1A in southern Fort Fairfield, a short way north of its junction with Up Country Road. It is a modest single-story wood frame structure, with clapboard siding, stone foundation, front-gable roof, and a three-stage square tower at its northeast corner. The east-facing front is dominated by a large stained-glass window and the tower, whose lower stage houses the main entrance, sheltered by a gabled hood with Italianate bracketing. The middle stage of the tower is shingled, and the upper stage has an open belfry with round-arch openings; the tower is topped by a pyramidal roof. The interior of the church is divided into the main sanctuary, which takes up two-thirds of the space, with the vestry facilities taking up the rest. The sanctuary is lined with oak pews, and there is a raised platform at the southwest corner, with a lectern. The ceiling and upper part of the walls are finished in metal paneling. A number of Quaker families moved to the Fort Fairfield area beginning in 1859, soon bringing interest for the construction of a meeting house. When built in 1863, this building was a simple structure, lacking both the tower and the stained-glass window. In 1906 the building underwent renovation, at which time the tower and window were added; the latter was dedicated to William Penn Varney and Lydia Cook Varney, longtime leaders of the meeting. The church was opened to other religious denominations in the early decades of the 20th century, but was closed due to declining enrollments sometime after World War II. By 1972 the building had been purchased by an Orthodox Presbyterian congregation. It was given to Frontier Heritage, a local historical society, in 1995, and rededicated as a Quaker meeting house in 2000.

Built in 1911, it is an architecturally distinctive blend of Baroque and Italian Renaissance architecture. The congregation was the first separate Roman Catholic congregation established in Madawaska, the result of many years' struggle, after the international border divided the French Catholic community here in 1842. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history St. David Catholic Church is set on the north side of US Route 1, between the road and the Saint John River. Its location is not far from the first landing site of the first French Acadians to arrive in the area in 1785. It is a large edifice, with a two-story facade with a central tower, and a large sanctuary behind, set on a stone foundation. The building is brick, with stone and wooden trim elements. The side walls of the sanctuary are divided into bays articulated by pilasters, with lancet-arched windows. The main facade is divided into five bays, the central three projecting. As on the sides, the bays are articulated by pilasters. There are three entrances, one at the center and two at the outer bays. All are set in round-arch openings, that in the center a more elaborate stone-trimmed setting. The second story repeats the arrangement of arched openings, with the bays flanking the center having sash windows with oriel windows above. A third level above the center bay begins the tower, which continues with an open octagonal belfry that has Corinthian columns supporting keystone arches. The parish of St. David was established in the Diocese of Portland in 1871, after many years of petition by local French Catholics. The area had been disputed territory between Maine and neighboring New Brunswick, and the 1842 Webster-Ashburton Treaty, which set the border on the Saint John River, divided the community. The Catholic population remained part of the Diocese of New Brunswick, but difficulties attending services in Canada, and the unwillingness of diocesan leaders to deal with Maine authorities prompted the drive for division, which was granted by papal decree in 1870. The parish's first church was completed in 1872; this larger church built in 1911-12 to a design by Chickering & O'Connell of Boston, and was dedicated in 1913.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Description and history The Watson Settlement Bridge is located in southeastern Littleton, a rural community in southern Aroostook County. The Meduxnekeag River flows north from Houlton into southeastern Littleton before turning east and crossing the international border into New Brunswick, Canada. Framingham Road, which the bridge formerly carried, crosses just south of the bridge on a modern structure. The covered bridge is about long, with two spans resting on stone abutments and a central pier. The bases of these structures are rubblestone that has been reinforced with concrete, with a top section that is contained within a timber cribwork. The structure is about wide and a similar height, with an internal clearance height of and width of . The support system for the two spans are Howe trusses. The exterior of the bridge is finished in vertical siding, and the roof is shingled. The bridge appears to be the first built at this location, no bridges having been marked on earlier maps of the area. It was built in 1911, and was attended by legal action between the county and the town over the cost of building its approaches, which was ultimately borne by the town.

Built in 1859-60, it is an excellent local example of religious Italianate architecture, and one of the state's few surviving churches designed by architect Thomas Holt. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The congregation was founded in 1859, and is affiliated with the Unitarian Universalist Association; its current minister is Rev. Jennifer Emrich. Description and history The First Parish Church is set in the center of Yarmouth, on the north side of Main Street, east of the North Yarmouth Academy and opposite Portland Street. It is a rectangular wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard and flushboard exterior, and a high brick foundation. A square section projects from the front facade, supporting a multistage tower and housing the main entrance. The entrance is set in a tall pilastered arch that also includes a pair of round-arch windows above. This stage of the tower has a rounded gable with modillioned eave, the latter detail also extended to the main roof. A plainly-pilastered square section tops this, with an eight-sided belfry above that has four round-arch openings. The tower is capped by an octagonal steeple. Windows on either side of the projecting section are two-port narrow windows, the upper section with a rounded arch top. Round-arch windows are also found on the building sides. The church was built in 1859-60, and is one of four known surviving church designs in the state of Thomas Holt, an architect from Bethel, Maine. The congregation was established in 1859 by a split from the local Universalist congregation. After 1885 the congregation declined, most of its members returning to the mother congregation. The two congregations merged soon afterward, at which time the name \\"Central Parish Church\\" was adopted. In 1920 it took the name \\"First Universalist Church\\", which it retained after merging with the Unitarian congregation in 1962.

History The Chiang Mai Night Safari was envisioned by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. He had a vision for starting up a nocturnal zoo, due to wanting to have a quality and popular tourist attraction, like that which was achieved by Singapore and also had become world-famous. Once the Prime Minister had this vision, he had brought it to the attention of Kosin Ketthong, the Governor of Chiang Mai at the time in order to find an appropriate place to start building. There were many places proposed, such as the forest areas of the Doi Saket District, but eventually, they settled upon an area at the foot of Doi Suthep, being the most ideal area which was located in the sub-district of Mae Hia, Chiang Mai. It was also in the Doi Suthep-Pui National Park area, having a terrain that was better than Singapore. The Prime Minister received approval No.90/2545 on the 25th of March 2002 and started a Chiang Mai Night Zoo Establishment Study Committee and Related Activities for Tourism Promotion.

Built in 1894 by local year-round residents, it is the most architecturally notable building on the island, and is representative of a late 19th-century trend of building summer chapels in coastal Maine. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history Cousins Island Chapel is located near the center of Cousins Island, on the east side of the main road (Cousins Street) at its junction with Talbot Road (which is the sole outlet to Littlejohn Island). The chapel is a modest single-story wood frame structure, with a steeply pitched gable roof, and an exterior finished in a combination of wooden shingles and board-and-batten siding. It is oriented with its long axis parallel to the road, with a band of sash windows offset to the left of center on the street-facing facade, and a hip-roofed entrance porch to the right. The gable ends have lancet-arched windows, some with stained glass, with board-and-batten siding in the gables. There are decorative sawn brackets at the lower edge of the roof where it flare out slightly. The chapel was built in 1894-95 by volunteer labor organized by the Yarmouth First Baptist Church, to provide a place of worship for the residents of Cousins and Littlejohn Islands. Although most of the services held there were Baptist, the building was open to all denominations. It was used regularly for services until World War II, and is now maintained by a local nonprofit group that organizes periodic summer services. The chapel is one of a series of architecturally distinctive coastal chapels built in Maine during the late 19th century, although it is distinguished from the others in that it was built for year-round residents, rather than for summer visitors.

The church building, built in 1839 and extensively altered in 1907, is one of the few surviving works of Maine architect and artist Harry Hayman Cochrane. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 for its architectural significance. Description and history The West Scarborough United Methodist Church is located in southern Scarborough, on the south side of US 1, between Orchard and Church Streets. It is a basically rectangular single-story wood frame structure, with a front- facing gable roof and an exterior finished clapboard and wood shingle siding. The front facade, facing north toward US 1, has a single large lancet-arch window at the center of the gabled nave section, and a slightly project square tower at the northeast corner. The tower houses the main entrance, sheltered by a shed-roof porch accessed by a low flight of wooden stairs, with a narrow lancet-arch window above and open belfry capped by a pyramidal roof. The east wall of the nave has five lancet-arch windows, of varying sizes, and the west wall has three symmetrically placed windows. The parish house extends from the southwest corner. The building interior has stained wainscoting on the walls, topped by pressed metal walls and ceiling. A raised platform extends from the chancel into the nave, housing space for the choir and organ, and curved rows of pews line the main space of the nave. The church congregation was established in 1802, and initially met in an abandoned Congregational church. This church, the second built by the congregation, was built in 1839 as a Greek Revival structure. In 1907 the congregation undertook a major renovation of the building, retaining Monmouth, Maine-based architect and artist Harry Hayman Cochrane. Cochrane was a prolific designer, and is believed to have worked on an estimated 300-500 commissions. This church is one of only nine known to survive, and is the only one outside Monmouth. Alterations to the building included changing the roof to a steeper pitch, adding the tower, and replacing sash windows with Gothic stained glass. The interior walls, which might otherwise have had murals painted by Cochrane, may have been finished in metal as a cost-saving measure.

Built in 1843, it is a little-altered modest Greek Revival structure, with a reversed interior layout (with the pulpit at the entrance) that is now extremely rare within the state. It has been used only sporadically since the early 20th century, but is maintained by a local community group. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The East Harpswell Free Will Baptist Church is located on the west side of Cundys Harbor Road, the main thoroughfare on Sebascodegan Island, which makes up the easternmost portion of the town of Harpswell. It is a simple, rectangular wood-frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and granite foundation. Its main facade, facing east toward the road, is symmetrical, with two bays articulated by pilasters that rise to a plain frieze board, with a fully pedimented gable above. Each bay houses an entrance, flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom window and corniced entablature. The side walls each have two sash windows, and there is a single window on the back wall. The entries open into a narrow vestibule/hall space, set behind the pulpit, with interior doors that open into the main sanctuary on either side. The sanctuary has a coved plaster ceiling and three groups of original box pews, with a raised platform at the rear containing more pews. The Free Will Baptist congregation on Sebascodegan Island was organized in 1817; where it met prior to construction of this building is not known with certainty. In 1843, the land for this building was purchased, and the building was probably built soon thereafter. The congregation's height in terms of size was between about 1840 and 1864, after which a steady decline began. By the early 20th century the congregation was moribund, and services were discontinued. There was a brief revival in the 1930s, when the building underwent some maintenance. Since the 1960s the building has been maintained by the local garden club, and is occasionally used for services and other events. The building is one of twelve in the state that were once known to have the reverse orientation, with the pulpit set between the entrances. Most of these have either been altered to a more conventional orientation, or even demolished. The only other high-quality example of the form is the Federal period Lincolnville Center Meeting House in Lincolnville.

Green and Davidson laid the groundwork for archaeology in Samoa. Among the many findings of this project were ceramics on Upolu and Apolima. However, a key finding near the end of this trip was the discovery of Lapita pottery remains at Mulifanua with radio carbon dates of 930-800 BC.

Retrieved 1 November 2009 An important part of Davidson's work in Samoa over the years focused on settlement patterns before European contact. She became the first to make a case based on archaeological field work for the distribution of a much greater Samoan population in the 17th and 18th centuries AD. Early population estimates in the 19th century had been vastly different. There were other archaeologists who carried out important field work in Samoa, including American Jesse D. Jennings and Richard Holmer in the 1970s. Jennings led studies at Mt Olo Plantation on Upolu and inland from Sapapali'i on Savai'i. Extensive pre-historic settlement ruins were surveyed, mapped and excavated in August, September and October 1974, 1976 and 1977 under the University of Utah Samoan Archaeological Program. From 1978 to 1979, further field work was carried out with extensive surveys of a pre-historic settlement in the Palauli district. This survey at Palauli was done by Gregory Jackmond, an American Peace Corps volunteer who had previously done field work of pre-historic ruins inland from Sapapali'i village. In 2002-2004 extensive excavations were carried out at the Pulemelei mound in Savai'i under the leadership of the Swedish archaeologist Helene Martinsson-Wallin (Kon-Tiki Museum research institute/Gotland University) in collaboration with Paul Wallin (Kon-Tiki Museum/Gotland University) and Geoffrey Clark (Australian National University). These excavations and subsequent field studies by Martinsson- Wallin at the Letolo plantation, Malaefono Starmound and Fale o le Fe'e, led to a collaboration with the National University of Samoa to create an archaeology programme. Many other scholars contributed to the field of archaeology in Samoa before 1957 including MƒÅori historian Te Rangi Hƒ´roa (also known as Sir Peter Henry Buck) and Derek Freeman who carried out field work at Vailele and the Falemauga Caves on Upolu while he was a school teacher in Samoa during the early 1940s. Key sites Savai'i Key sites in field work on Savai'i island include prehistoric settlements situated inland at Sapapali'i, extensive village settlements in Palauli, where the Pulemelei Mound is situated and a midden site at the village of Siutu on the south coast.

Retrieved 1 November 2009 Archaeological work at Sapapali'i was carried out by Jackmond, who surveyed a 20 hectare area and discovered extensive prehistoric ruins. The data from Jackmond's work at Sapapali'i tended to replicate the data collected at the Mt Olo Plantation site on Upolu with similar stone walls, raised walkways and platforms. One important difference were the greater number of earth ovens uncovered at the Savai'i site. The team at the Mt Olo site had previously theorised that earth ovens were a sign of social ranking and status. When these surveys were completed in 1976, Jackmond's Peace Corp work was extended for a further two years and he carried out field work on the extensive prehistoric settlements in Palauli district. Earlier mapping of Savai'i including the Pulemelei mound had been carried out by S.D. Scott and Alistair G. Buist in 1969. Their field work on Savai'i in 1969 showed archaeological remains of dense inland settlements prior to European contact in Safotu, Safune and Fagamalo (Matautu village district, Savai'i Island), on the north coast of the island.

The site is situated on land which is known in modern times as the Nelson Plantation under the Nelson Corporation Board. During colonialism in the late 19th century, the land came under German ownership and sold to a Swedish trader August Nilspeter Gustav Nelson, who married a Samoan woman and ran a trading post in Safune. In recent years, court cases have resulted between chiefs in Palauli and the Nelson family over ownership of the land. Entry into the plantation is over the bridge at the west end of Vailoa, the capital of Palauli. Jackmond's survey during 1977 - 1978 at Letolo covered an area from the south coast to gently sloping land 3 km inland to an elevation of 135m at the northern edge. The area is bounded on the east side by the Faleata River and on the west side by the Seugagogo River. Within the 198.8 hectare area surveyed, approximately 3,000 features of human manufacture were recorded, including foundation platforms, 64.6 km of stone fences, primary and secondary walkways, and some 300 house sites. A total of 1059 platforms were recorded; the largest of these is Pulemelei Mound which had previously been reported by other archaeologists. The Pulemelei mound is 50 m √ó 61 m and 12 m high. From the ground, it slopes inward and upwards, in steps, to a flat level top. From the top of Pulemelei, one can view the sea looking south. Estimated dates of construction place it between 1100 and 1400 AD. In general, the platforms averaged 236 ¬± 251 m¬≤ in basal area and 46 ¬± 52 cm in height. The platforms were rectangular or oval in shape, except for two small star mounds 7.8 m (7 arms) and 10 m (5 arms) in diameter and 50 cm in height.

Extensive archaeological excavations were carried out at Pulemelei mound during the years 2002-2004 by Helene Martinsson-Wallin The Kon-Tiki Museum/Gotland University and adjunct professor at The National University of Samoa. The excavations showed that Pulemelei mound started to be built around 700‚Äì900 years ago as a 60x65 meter large and 3 meter high platform which was outlined of cut stone on edge. It was built on top of an earlier settlement that is at least 2000 years old with finds of pot sherds, stone tools and hearths. Around 400‚Äì500 years ago the mound was added on with to reach a high of 12 meter and two walkways were constructed in the west and east side of the mound.

Description and history The East Raymond Union Chapel is located on the south side of Webbs Mill Road (Maine State Route 85) in the center of the rural village of East Raymond. It is a modest single-story wood frame structure, with a steeply pitched gable roof and a square tower at its northeast corner. The exterior is clad in a combination of clapboards and decorative wooden shingles. The three-stage tower houses the building entrance in a Gothic-arched recess on the ground floor, and an open belfry at the top, with pointed-arch openings and gablets rising above, into the pyramidal roof. The main front facade has a single bay with a pair of narrow sash windows under a Queen Anne hood, and a similar single sash window in the gable above. The interior of the church has original pine bench pews, and a raised altar platform with Eastlake-style furnishings. The chapel was built between 1880 and 1890 as a local community project, organized under the auspices of a benevolent society established for the purpose. It does not have a known designer, and its design represents a late use of Gothic Revival elements (which had fallen out of fashion in Maine in the 1850s), and a modern (for the period) use of Queen Anne and Eastlake elements. The building has had relatively few alterations since its construction, principally to accommodate a ramp at the entrance.

The church is affiliated with the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches; its pastor is John Carson. Description and history The Elijah Kellogg Church is located in Harpswell Center, on the east side of Harpswell Neck Road, opposite the 1750s Harpswell Meetinghouse. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, exterior mostly finished in clapboards, and a granite foundation. The roof is capped by a multi-stage tower, whose short first stage is finished in matchboard, with a taller second stage with corner pilasters, and an open square belfry with an entablatured cornice supported by pilastered posts, and a steeple above. The most prominent feature of the main facade is the entrance, which is set in an ogee-carved archway with tracery windows above and flanking the doors. Paired pilasters are set at the building corners, rising to a fully pedimented triangular pediment. The side walls are divided into two bays, articulated by pilasters, with sash windows topped by lancet-arched louvers. The church was built in 1843, by a Congregationalist church congregation whose roots dated to 1753. The church was built in response to a controversy over ownership of the old meetinghouse, which was built prior to the principles of separation of church and state, and had been used for both civic and religious functions. The church's first pastor was Rev. Elijah Kellogg, then recently graduated from nearby Bowdoin College. Kellogg served as pastor until 1854, but remained attached to the town, retiring to Harpswell in 1882, and again serving the church from 1889 until his death in 1901. Kellogg is best known as an author of a series of children's books.

History Founded in 1925 by Dr. John Henry Lyons as an adjunct of the Pasadena school system, The Pasadena Boys Choir survives today as one of the oldest civic boy choirs in the United States. In 1971, the Choir was reorganized by its current Director, John Barron, as a private, non-profit educational institution. Today the Choir is composed of boys between the ages of 8 and 13 from all ethnic and socio- economic backgrounds who attend public, private and parochial schools throughout the greater San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys. Since 1971, over 2,000 boys have been members of the Choir. The organization's admission policy is strictly non-discriminatory and non-denominational and any boy who meets the 8-to-13 age requirement is welcome to apply. All members attend their own schools and the initial time commitment on a boy's part is two two- to three- hour classes each week, after school and on Sundays. Over the years, the Choir has received numerous awards and commendations. Endorsements have come from the California Parent Teachers Association, the State Superintendent of Schools, and the California State Legislature in Sacramento. Training Program Boys that enter the Pasadena Boys Choir program are initially assigned to a Beginner's Class for at least one semester. There they begin a comprehensive training program which will eventually prepare them for public performance. The Boys receive professional instruction in music theory, vocal production, ear training, stage deportment and public speaking. Included in this initial introduction are classical, patriotic, folk, songs from musicals and contemporary pop music. After successfully completing the beginner's program, boys advance to the next level of training and are moved to the main performance group. The boys are expected to remain for a full term of training through their eighth grade school year or age 13. Performances During a typical season from September to June, the Choir may be called upon to perform in a number of varied concert and entertainment venues. Among these are weddings, banquets, conventions and seasonal programs. In addition, occasional calls are received from movie, television and other production companies in the Southern California area. Summer Camp The choir operates during the normal school year with the exception of a two-week summer camp session during the last week of July and the first week of August. Tax Status The Pasadena Boys Choir is a registered nonprofit organization.

Built in 1828, the Greek Revival building historically served as both a church and marketplace. It was for many years the city's largest commercial building, and survived the city's great 1866 fire. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It is now home to the Old Port Tavern and other commercial businesses. Description and history The former Mariner's Church occupies much a city block in Portland's Old Port area. It occupies a trapezoidal lot bounded on the north by Fore Street, the east by Market Street, and the west by Moulton Street, with its main facade facing toward Fore Street. It is a three-story masonry structure, built of granite and brick, with a broad gabled roof. The main facade has six storefronts on the ground floor, each with a recessed entrance flanked on one side by a large fixed-pane display window. The second floor has a bank of twelve round-arch windows, with rectangular windows on the third level. The gable above is fully pedimented, with a fanlight window near the center of its base. The building's corners are rounded, the left one in brick and the right one in stone. The main facade is predominantly stone, with the street-facing side walls mainly brick. The building was constructed in 1828 and was used for \\"moral and religious\\" instruction of local mariners, with the building's upkeep supported by the commercial businesses on its ground floor. The building was damaged in the city's 1866 fire. In 1969 the building was purchased by C.H. Robinson who saved it from demolition. In 1973 the building opened as a restaurant known as the Old Port Tavern, and the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places that same year. Today the building is used for events as the Mariner's Church Banquet Center and also contains a billiards hall.http://oldporttavern.com/mcbc/banquet-center-home- page/ See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Portland, Maine References Category:Churches in Portland, Maine Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Churches completed in 1828 Category:Greek Revival church buildings in Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Portland, Maine Category:Historic district contributing properties in Maine ","title":"Mariner's Church (Portland, Maine)"},{"id":"24918575","text":"The North Yarmouth and Freeport Baptist Meetinghouse, also known as the Old Baptist Meeting House, is an historic church on Hillside Street in Yarmouth, Maine.

The church property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description The St. Lawrence Arts Center stands northeast of the summit of Munjoy Hill, on the southeast side of Congress Street between Munjoy and Beckett Streets. The center's facilities include a 110-seat theater with state-of-the art equipment. Although the theater is used for regular theatrical productions, it is also available for other events, including private functions. History The local Congregationalists organized in the neighborhood 1854 to build St. Lawrence Chapel. Having outgrown that facility, the church was erected in 1897 to a design by New York City architect Arthur Jennings. The building was unique within the state for its combination of Richardsonian Romanesque and French Chateau elements. Maintenance suffered as the congregation dwindled in later years due to increasing costs and demographic changes; the church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in an effort to help preserve it. The congregation eventually dissolved itself in 1986 and deconsecrated the building. The building stood empty until purchased in 1997 by the Friends of St. Lawrence Church.

The church itself is set back from Congress Street, with the main entrance facing Locust, and the wood frame rectory set closer to Congress Street. The church is a handsome rectangular stone structure, one story in height, with a steeply pitched gabled slate roof. Its sides and corners are buttressed, with narrow Gothic lancet-arch windows in between, and a rose window in the gable facing Congress Street. The back gable wall is finished in wooden clapboards, with a large three-sided stained glass window in the gable. The entrance is set in a large Gothic opening in a gabled projection. The first Episcopal congregation in Portland was known as St. Paul's, but it was reorganized in 1839 and renamed St. Stephen's.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The rector is Rev. Carolyn H. Eklund. Architecture St. Paul's is located two blocks west of Brunswick's Maine Street downtown area, at the southeast corner of Pleasant and Union Streets. The church is a modest cruciform structure, built out of wood and finished in vertical board-and-batten siding. It is covered by a gabled roof, and diverges from standard plans published by Upjohn in that it has no tower, and that it has transepts, which were not present in plans found in his 1852 Upjohn's Rural Architecture guide. It has lancet-arched Gothic windows on the sides, and the entrance, at the west end, is set in a lancet-arched opening sheltered by a bracketed hood. Each of the gable ends has a small oculus window in the gable. The Brunswick Episcopal congregation was organized in 1844, and was the third established in the state of Maine. This church, built in 1845, was designed by Richard Upjohn, who had already achieved national notice through the construction of Trinity Church in Manhattan (1841, now a National Historic Landmark), and St. John's Episcopal Church in Bangor (1839, burned 1911). Upjohn's fame brought much business, including for smaller and less well-to-do parishes, leading to his publication in 1852 of Upjohn's Rural Architecture.

The building is covered by a gabled roof and sheathed in wooden clapboards, and rests on a granite foundation. The main facade has a stepped appearance, with three sections. At the right is the tower, which rises two stages to a skirt roof, above which is an open belfry with an octagonal spire. Both the skirt roof and the spire have small gabled sections.

It is a basically rectangular wood frame building, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. A gabled entry vestibule projects from the front, with a square two-stage tower rising above the line between it and the main block. The tower has a plain first stage, and then a belfry with round-arch louvered openings, and a dome- shaped spire and weathervane at the top. The vestibule section is very plain, with a fully pedimented gable, and a pair of entrances, each flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature and cornice. Windows appear on the sides and rear of the building, most with a Gothic arched fan as a decorative element above. The interior retains significant original finishes, including box pews and a kerosene-powered chandelier. The original congregation was formed as a branch of the second parish of South Portland.

There is no official statistic in regard to this accomplishment, though it is often noted by commentators and fans when it occurs. There is a disagreement as to the exact definition of striking out the side. Some feel a pitcher should be credited with striking out the side when all three outs in the inning were obtained via the strikeout, regardless of what other hitters that the pitcher has faced have done. Others believe a pitcher only has struck out the side when he has retired 3 batters in succession without allowing anyone to reach base. In theory, a pitcher can record any number of strikeouts in an inning, since it is possible for a batter to safely reach first base without recording an out if the catcher does not hold the third strike. Recording more than three strikeouts in an inning, however, is a rare occurrence.

During the middle 1930s, he wrote the daily foreign affairs column \\"Behind the Cables\\" for the New York Post. Later still, he was charged with having secretly worked recruiting potential agents and gathering information on behalf of the Soviet foreign intelligence network. Background Ludwig Lore was born to working class parents of ethnic Jewish extraction in Friedeberg am Qwast in Lower Silesia (now Mirsk, Poland) on June 26, 1875. Lore attended gymnasium in \\"Hirschberg, (now Jelenia G√≥ra), also in Lower Silesia) and later graduated from Berlin University, where he studied under political economist Werner Sombart. Upon completion of his education in 1892, Lore went to work in the textile industry. He remained in that industry until emigrating to the United States in 1903. While in Germany, Lore joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of that country, holding office in the party and standing as an SPD candidate for political office. Career Caricature of Ludwig Lore drawn at the founding convention of the Communist Labor Party by Art Young for The Liberator, October 1919. Socialist period Lore emigrated to America in 1903 and first settled in the state of Colorado where he worked at various jobs. While in Colorado, Lore joined the fledgling Industrial Workers of the World. Lore later moved to New York City where he joined the staff of the German-language socialist daily, the New Yorker Volkszeitung, becoming Associate Editor of the publication within a few yearsBuhle, \\"Ludwig Lore (1875-1942),\\" in Encyclopedia of the American Left, pg. 435. and editor-in- chief during World War I. Under Lore the paper had more the feel of a tabloid magazine than a typical straight newspaper, an orientation which is said by American historian Paul Buhle to have \\"suited his personality and approach.\\"Paul Buhle, \\"Ludwig Lore and the New Yorker Volkszeitung,\\" pg. 172.

On May 30 and 31, 1917, the Socialist Party organized an event in New York City touted as the First American Conference for Peace and Democracy, aimed at joining various anti-war groups into a common effort to bring a speedy end to the European conflagration.\\"Forces of Peace and Democracy Unite in Inspiring Conference at New York City,\\" Appeal to Reason [Girard, KS], whole no. 1124 (June 16, 1917), pg. 2. As an anti-war emigrant from the German empire, Ludwig Lore played a prominent role at this gathering, delivering a speech to the gathering at the first day's session in which he expounded upon the peace efforts being made in Germany by the Social Democratic Party to bring about immediate peace. Records indicate the following election efforts: * November 2, 1915: New York Assembly - Kings County, District 07: lost with 2.62% vote * November 7, 1916: New York Assembly - Kings County, District 09: lost with 6.24% vote * November 7, 1917: New York Assembly - Kings County, District 20: lost with 18.69% vote * November 4, 1924: New York Assembly - Kings County, District 14: lost with 0.79% vote (Source: OurCampaigns.com ) Communist period Cover of the May 1919 issue of Lore's theoretical magazine, The Class Struggle.In 1917, Lore founded the bi-monthly Marxist theoretical magazine, The Class Struggle, which he edited in conjunction with Louis C. Fraina and Louis Boudin. Lore was a founding member of the Communist Labor Party of America, an organization which, following a decade of splits and mergers, ultimately evolved into the Communist Party USA. During this interval, Lore's New Yorker Volkszeitung was brought into the communist orbit, albeit neither fully nor wholeheartedly. The paper professed what was essentially a Communist interpretation of international events and advocated a general Communist policy at home, yet was only partially and unwillingly dragged into the mire of the bitter factional Communist Party politics of the 1920s.Buhle, \\"Ludwig Lore and the New Yorker Volkszeitung,\\" pg. 175. One historian notes: > For the [New Yorker Volkszeitung] veteran, the struggle for political, > electoral socialism in the United States had taken decades of self-sacrifice > and many reversals. Readers of the paper had never been happy with the > 'underground' mentality of the early Communist movement, because they viewed > hyperrevolutionary rhetoric as the worst possible response to repression. > The formation of a legal Workers Party in 1922, and the beginnings of a > political campaign structure (minimal though it was), encouraged them > greatly. Lore was two times a candidate of the Workers Party of America, running for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1922 and for U.S. Congress in the New York 14th District in 1924. In 1924, Lore became an early victim of Party factionalism (discussed by Whittaker Chambers in his memoirs ). James P. Cannon led the charges against Lore, which he summarized as (1) misconception of the strategy and tactics of the Communist International and (2) wrong analysis of the economic and political forces operating within the framework of present-day America. He went on to denounce him for \\"Loreism.\\" (or \\"incurable Loreism\\" as Chambers put it). C. E. Reuthenberg continued to denounce Loreism in 1925. (Cannon would continue to castigate Lore into the 1930s. ) In August 1925, the party expelled Lore. Post-Communist period Lore was an independent thinker who was reluctant to take political orders,Buhle, \\"Ludwig Lore and the New Yorker Volkszeitung,\\" pg. 176. a personal characteristic which made him unsuited for the increasingly centralized Communist movement of the late 1920s. In addition, his well-known personal fondness for Leon Trotsky,Buhle, \\"Ludwig Lore and the New Yorker Volkszeitung,\\" pp. 176-177. established during Trotsky's time living in New York, during which he wrote for The Class Struggle, made Lore an easy target for factional opponents. In 1925, fearing proto-Trotskyist indiscipline, Lore was brought up on charges before the executive of the Workers (Communist) Party's German Language Federation. When the executive refused to expel Lore, changes were made in the composition of the body to make Lore's expulsion inevitable.Buhle, \\"Ludwig Lore and the New Yorker Volkszeitung,\\" pg. 177. Lore was expelled from the organization later that same year. As editor of the Volkszeitung, Lore attempted what has described as a \\"balancing a feeling for a theoretical Marxist line with a more sensitive reading of American political culture,\\" in which he \\"tried, and ultimately failed, to develop a communism that would meet the demands of the aging generation of radical German- Americans in the 1920s and 1930s.\\"Editorial note in Elliott Shore, Ken Fones- Wolf, and James P. Danky (eds.), The German-American Radical Press: The Shaping of a Left Political Culture, pg. 146. By the end of the 1920s, the Volkszeitung had lost some of its radical edge, taking the form of a more vaguely \\"socialistic\\" labor and cultural publication, complete with wire service photos and non-political fare such as radio listings and classic literature. Lore sought to occupy political space in between social democracy and communism, a position roughly akin to that of the Independent Labour Party in Great Britain. As the 1920s came to a close and the Communist Party moved into an ultra-sectarian phase known as the \\"Third Period,\\" Lore found himself disaffected from his old party comrades. His Volkszeitung continued to defend the policies of the Soviet Union, however, and sought to support CP-sponsored initiatives in which radicals of various stripes could work together for common objectives, such as the International Workers Order and the International Labor Defense.Buhle, \\"Ludwig Lore and the New Yorker Volkszeitung,\\" pg. 178. In 1931, Lore gave up the editorship of the ailing Volkszeitung to become a freelance journalist.John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev, Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009; pg. 155. In 1934, Lore joined the editorial staff of the New York Post (then the New York Evening Post, a newspaper whose contributors have included Walt Whitman). For the Post, he wrote a daily foreign affairs column called \\"Behind the Cables,\\" in which he often emphasized the threat to world peace implicit in the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party in Germany. The Post used to run prominent ads for the column (see box that quotes ad in this entry). During World War II, Lore appeared regularly on WEVD radio (established by the Socialist Party of America in 1927, taken over by The Jewish Daily Forward in 1932). One of his first appearances was on August 8, 1939, on a symposium about the \\"Danzig Dispute\\" with Michael Kwapiszewski and Marko deDominis. His last appearance was on June 3, 1942, on a Round Table program titled \\"Battle Front and Home Front\\" with Christopher T. Emmet Jr.. He left the Post in January 1942, when he \\"took over a special government assignment,\\" according to the New York Times. Personal life and death In 1909, Lore married Lily Schneppe (Chambers called her \\"Lillian\\"); together they had three boys. Ludwig Lore died on July 8, 1942, at his home on Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, New York. Legacy Espionage allegations During his freelance interval (1931-1934), Lore was recruited to work for the foreign intelligence network of the Soviet Union, working under the code-names \\"Leo\\" and \\"10.\\"Haynes, Klehr, and Vassiliev, Spies, pg. 156. According to historians Haynes and Klehr, the exact date of Lore's termination by Soviet intelligence is not known and no record of him is said to be found in secret police archives after April 1937. In fact, according to Lore's case file, on July 2, 1937, Moscow Centre instructed its New York \\"illegals\\" to break off the relationship with Lore and \\"to take measures to avoid any hostile actions\\" on his part. Chambers accounts As recounted in his 1952 memoir Witness, Whittaker Chambers came to know Lore because they both reported to rezident Markin: He described him as follows: > Lore was an old Bolshevik. He had been a Socialist before the Russian > Revolution. In those pre-revolutionary days, he had been the friend of > Trotsky, then a New York Socialist journalist. After the Revolution, Lore > had managed an American speaking trip for Alexandra Kollontai, the author of > Red Love, later the Soviet ambassador to Sweden. Bukharin, in his New York > days, had eaten and slept in the apartment on 55th Street in Brooklyn, where > Lore, his outspokenly anti-Communist wife and three wholly American sons > still lived. He describes the Lore family with some detail: > I was introduced to Lillian Lore, Ludwig's remarkable wife, who in large > part provided those meals, and, by some economic miracle, had kept that > amazing household together during the long, lean years, had fed the endless > procession of guests. \\"Die unvergessliche Lores-the unforgettable Lores,\\" a > German friend had called them ... I have seldom seen a happy family life so > explicit in the characters of all who shared it... I soon came to regard the > Lores' house as a kind of second home. For Ludwig I developed an almost > filial feeling as of a younger for an older revolutionist. The kindness of > all the Lores to me was personal, and in spite of politics, for all the > other members of the family, except Ludwig, were outspoken in their > detestation of the Communist Party. Chambers also describes a defector's fear of retribution from the Soviet Underground, which Lore and he shared: > I did not know that at the very time I was visiting him most frequently, > Lore was under surveillance. He was being watched, not by the American > authorities, but by the Russian secret police... I discovered that he was > afraid to walk alone with me on the street at night and that he was > terrified to get into an automobile alone with me. Then I knew that there > was something seriously amiss. But I had been out of the Communist Party six > or seven years, and Lore was dead, before I discovered that the old > Bolshevik, in whom, as a younger man, I respected the older revolutionist, > had denounced me (around 1941) to the F.B.I. I learned it not from the FBI, > but from another security agency of the Government. > I respected Lore all the more for that act. My feeling for him and for all > the Lores remained unchanged. \\"Conservative\\" accounts American historians John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, with former KGB officer Alexander Vassiliev, have credited Lore with the recruitment and handling of David A. Salmon (code-named \\"Willi\\"), one of Soviet intelligence's most important information assets in the US government.Haynes, Klehr, and Vassiliev, Spies, pg. 198. Note that the veracity of the identification of \\"Willi\\" as Salmon has been challenged by Russian historian Svetlana Chervonnaya. Citing Soviet archival evidence, the historians charge that from 1934 until early 1937 Lore paid Salmon, chief of the U.S. Department of State's communication and archives division, a stipend of $500 per month in exchange for classified diplomatic communications ‚Äî information then passed along to the Soviets.Haynes, Klehr, and Vassiliev, Spies, pg. 196. While it is not clear whether Salmon was aware he was providing information to a foreign government or merely leaking information for a fee to a prominent New York Post journalist,Haynes, Klehr, and Vassiliev, Spies, pg. 199. or even whether Salmon was \\"Willi\\" at all,Svetlana Chervonnaya, \\"David Aden Salmon (1879-?),\\" DocumentsTalk.com. Retrieved August 11, 2010. the fact remains that for several years Soviet intelligence had unparalleled access to the secret communications of prominent diplomatic and military decision-makers through Lore's connection. According to Haynes and Klehr, Lore's contact with Soviet intelligence seems to have been ended in 1937 owing to a belief in Moscow that Lore retained ties to the Trotskyist movement.Haynes, Klehr, and Vassiliev, Spies, pg. 158. In the superheated atmosphere of the Great Purge the Trotskyists were believed by Soviet authorities to be engaged in an international terrorist conspiracy aimed at the overthrow of the Stalin regime and Lore's purported connection cast doubt upon his loyalty and reliability. In addition, Lore was believed by his Soviet handlers to have been guilty of financial improprieties, taking the form of double-dipping for multiple monthly expense stipends. In fact, the real reason for the Soviet's termination of relationship was their discovery that Lore had cheated them about the identity of his sources at the Department of State. \\"Liberal\\" accounts Julius Kobyakov, a Russian major general in the SVR and previously a \\"deputy director of the KGB's American Division in the late 1980s\\", adds some detail to Chambers' account, in that \\"Leo\\" began his work for Soviet intelligence in 1933, recruited by Soviet intelligence rezident Valentin Markin. In 2004, he wrote: > I can refer to the case of LEO and his sub-sources: WILLIE, DANIEL and > others (HW p. 34-35). The authors dutifully copied and translated odd > reports from the case-file but when it came to analysis and conclusions they > were not up to the task.

His path curiously crossed with that of Chambers, who > mentioned him several dozen times\\"Witness\\" pp. 201, 217, 352, 387-392, > 412-413, 492. (Note: The \\"authors\\" refer to Allen Weinstein and Alexander > Vassiliev.) Svetlana Chervonnaya, another Russian historian, asserts that Lore falsely claimed the high ranking functionary Salmon as his source so as to throw his Soviet handlers off the trail to the fact that he was himself rewriting information obtained from \\"lower level clerks at the Communications and Records Division.\\"Svetlana Chervonnaya, \\"Ludwig Lore: A Background File,\\" DocumentsTalk.com. Retrieved August 11, 2010. After enhancing the mundane information which he received with his own interpretive content, Lore then pocketed the handsome monthly stipend which was purportedly destined for the top-ranking official Salmon, Chervonnaya charges. Chervonnaya indicates that in February 1937 Lore's deception was discovered by Soviet intelligence when they rented an apartment across the street from Lore and began round-the-clock surveillance.I.N.

The church was built in 1877, and is a significant Gothic work by Francis H. Fassett. The parish house, built in 1905, was designed by John Calvin Stevens and John Howard Stevens. The church is historically notable as the founding site of Christian Endeavor International, consider a major forerunner of modern youth ministries. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The church congregation merged with another in 2011, and the property was sold for rehabilitation and redevelopment. It now houses professional offices. Description and history The Williston-West Church and Parish House stand in Portland West End, on the west side of Thomas Street, occupying the north half of the block between Carroll and Clifford Streets. The church, standing at the corner of Carroll and Thomas, is a somewhat irregularly shaped complex, dominated by a square three-story tower at the street corner. The walls are buttressed, and lined with Gothic-arched windows, with a large rose window in the main facade. Separated from the church by a courtyard to its south is the parish house, a two-story brick building of compatible style. The church complex is unusual for containing works separated in time by two of the city's most prominent architects. Francis H. Fassett was the city's leading architect in the mid-19th century, and mentored John Calvin Stevens in his early years. The church is also of historical note, for it was here that Francis Edward Clark established Christian Endeavor, a non-denominational youth ministry that is now international in its scope. With its congregation declining in size, the Williston-West Church was merged in 2011 with the Immanuel Baptist-American Baptist Churches to form the Williston-Immanuel Church, which meets in a church on High Street. The church property was then sold to a developer. In 2014 the property was involved in a rezoning lawsuit in which the city of Portland eventually prevailed in the state supreme court. It now houses the offices of Majella Global Technologies.

Major League Baseball (MLB) allows the instant replay review to allow league officials to review certain types of plays in order to determine the accuracy of the initial call of the umpires on the field. Reviews may be initiated either by a team's manager with limitations or by the umpires themselves. All instant-replay reviews are examined by umpires at the Replay Command Center in New York City, who has the final decision as to whether to uphold or overturn the initial call. MLB was the last of the four major North American professional sports leagues to implement an instant replay review system. Instant replay review was first implemented during the 2008 season. Under that system, only the umpire crew chief could initiate a review, and one or more members of the umpiring crew would review the video at the stadium and render the decision to uphold or overturn the call. Only boundary home run calls could be reviewed, either if the initial call was a home run but might not have been (e.g., spectator interference or a foul ball near the foul pole) or if the initial call was not a home run but might have been (e.g., the ball hit an object such as a railing beyond the outfield wall and then bounced back onto the field). The current instant replay system was implemented in the 2014 season. Under the current system, each manager is allotted one challenge per game, with additional challenges granted only if the previous one was successful. From the eighth inning on, the umpire crew chief is allowed to initiate his own replay review. The umpire crew chief is also allowed to initiate a review during any inning if the play in question is a boundary home run call. Procedure The following plays may be subjected to instant replay review:http://m.mlb.com/official_rules/replay_review * Home run or boundary calls, including placement of runners *Fair/foul calls on balls hit into the outfield * Force plays and tag plays * Catch/trap calls on balls hit into the outfield, i.e., whether an outfielder cleanly caught a ball on the fly or trapped it against his body *Whether a runner passed a preceding runner * Time plays, i.e., whether or not a run scored prior to the third out *Missed bases * Scorekeeping issues, including the count, number of outs, score, or substitutions * Whether a batter was hit by a pitch *Collisions at home plate (Rule 6.01(i)) *Tag-ups * Interference on double plays *Spectator interference In addition, the crew chief can use replay to review the following issues at any time, which is not considered a challenge: * The count, the number of outs, and the score * Substitutions * Batting out of turn * Rules check In cases where an appeal is required by rule (e.g. missed base, tag-up), an appeal must be made, and it is the call on the appeal that is reviewed. To initiate a manager's challenge, a manager must either enter the field of play and verbally tell the umpire he will use his challenge, or call or signal the challenge from the top of the dugout, within 30 seconds after the end of the play. Teams are allowed to have a replay assistant in the booth watch the replay and talk with a coach via the dugout telephone to decide if the team should challenge the call. A player or coach in the dugout will signal to the manager whether or not to use the challenge. The manager must signal to hold play within 10 seconds after the end of the play in order to wait for his replay booth's decision. When a play is reviewed, at least two umpires (including the crew chief) will go to an area behind home plate where they will meet a technician. The technician hands the umpires headsets where they can communicate with the umpires at the Replay Command Center in New York City. During the review, the replay may be displayed on the stadium video screen. Once the call is determined, the field technician will leave and the crew chief will signal the final call. If a manager enters the field of play to argue a reviewed call, he will be automatically ejected from the game.http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/all-systems-go-with-expanded-instant- replay-for-major-league- baseball?ymd=20140327&content;_id=70050812&vkey;=news_mlb After being reviewed, umpires will call one of three review outcomes. If they play is confirmed, the umpire found clear and convincing evidence that the original call was correct. If the play is overturned, the umpire found clear and convincing evidence that the original call was incorrect. If the umpire found no clear evidence to overturn the call, the call stands. The Replay Review lasts no more than two minutes. The clock begins after what is being challenged is established by the Crew Chief. There are a few exceptions to this time limit however, including placement of runners, multiple challenges, technology issues, rules application, and director discretion. Some plays are non-reviewable, so Instant Replay cannot be used. These plays include subjective calls, such as check swings, infield fly rule, and balls and strikes. Other calls that are considered non-reviewable are trap plays (infield), foul tips, and mound visit count. Background Instant replay in MLB actually had been used once before in the 1999 season during a Florida Marlins home game at Pro Player Stadium. This was the first instance in which instant replay was utilized in Major League Baseball. While playing the St. Louis Cardinals, Cliff Floyd hit a ball off the top of the left-field scoreboard. Originally ruled a double and then ruled a home run, NL Umpire Frank Pulli reverted the call back to a double after consulting a TV monitor in the Marlins' dugout. The Cardinals won the game, 5-2, and the Marlins protested the use of the TV monitor. The National League Office declared that the umpires erred in using instant replay, and the American League Office concurred that instant replay was not to be used in the future. However, the Marlins' protest was denied on the grounds that it was a judgment call rather than a rules violation as such, and the play stood. MLB did not use instant replay again for almost a decade. Major League Baseball instant replay was instituted on August 28, 2008 by commissioner Bud Selig. \\"I believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis,\\" Commissioner Selig said. \\"The system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game.\\" Although MLB was the last of the four major United States professional sports leagues to implement an instant replay review system, replay was used 123 times between August 28, 2008 and the conclusion of the 2010 season (with 48 of those instances resulting in overturned calls). Official Debut Replay made its official, sanctioned MLB debut at Tropicana Field on September 3, 2008, after Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees hit a ball near the left-field foul pole that was initially ruled a home run by third base umpire Brian Runge. Tampa Bay Rays' manager Joe Maddon and catcher Dioner Navarro argued that the ball was foul and asked for a review. After a conversation among the umpires, crew chief Charlie Reliford allowed the replay, which was sent by MLB.com logger Dominic Sims, to take place and after review, upheld the home run call. The first instance of an umpire's call being overturned by instant replay also occurred at Tropicana Field. On September 19, 2008, in the bottom of the 4th inning with two men on, Carlos Pe√±a of the Rays hit the ball just over the fence in right field. The umpires originally ruled that there was spectator interference, but after several minutes of viewing replays, the umpires returned to the field and signaled it a home run, extending the Rays' lead to 9-0. Aside from the two aforementioned reviews at Tampa Bay, review was used five additional times during the 2008 regular season: twice at Houston, and once each at Seattle, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. Usage of Instant Replay On March 16, 2009, during the 2009 World Baseball Classic, instant replay was requested for the first time in the tournament's history at Dolphin Stadium to give Venezuela a home run against Puerto Rico. Crew chief Ed Rapuano stated in a postgame press conference that there was never any replay, because the \\"war room\\" in New York City was unable to send him a replay of the play in question due to technical difficulties. The umpires, two from the United States and two from Japan, then worked with a translator to make a final ruling. Three of the four umpires said they believed it was a home run, and when third-base umpire Hitoshi Watarida was asked by Rapuano if he was \\"110 percent sure\\" that it was a home run, Watarida said yes. Nearly 10 minutes after first entering the dugout, the umpires returned to the field and awarded the Venezuelan team with a home run. Instant replay instead made its WBC debut during the 2013 World Baseball Classic, as umpires upheld a home run call during a Mexico vs. USA game. On June 19, 2009, instant replay was used twice in a game for the first time, during a Detroit Tigers vs. Milwaukee Brewers game. On October 31, 2009, instant replay was used for the first time in a World Series. In the fourth inning of Game 3 of the World Series, Alex Rodriguez hit a ball that bounced off the camera in right field. Initially called as a double, the umpires reviewed the play, and determined that had the camera not been in its location, the ball probably would have left the park, and a home run was awarded to Rodriguez, making the score 3-2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6TYwUHf3yw On June 1, 2011, Billy Butler of the Kansas City Royals hit a fly ball to left field in the bottom of the ninth inning of a scoreless game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. The ball hit off the fence over the left-field wall and skipped back onto the field. It was ruled a double and Jeff Francoeur held at third. Manager Ned Yost argued that it was a home run. After review, the umpires accordingly ruled a home run, granting the Royals a 2-0 victory. This was the second walk- off home run reviewed by instant replay in MLB history. On August 18, 2011, Justin Morneau of the Minnesota Twins hit a deep fly ball to right field that appeared to go just to the right side of the foul pole for a foul ball in a game against the New York Yankees. However, the umpires immediately called it a home run. Yankees manager Joe Girardi came out to argue the call and ask for a review. The umpires reviewed and ruled that the ball did indeed go past the right side of the foul pole, thus calling it a foul ball. Twins manager Ron Gardenhire came out to argue the call and was ejected from the game by home plate umpire Brian O'Nora for arguing a decision to change a call after looking at instant replay, which pursuant to MLB rule, shall result in an automatic ejection. On September 4, 2011, Hunter Pence of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a fly ball to deep right field. Originally ruled a live ball, instant replay showed Florida Marlins right fielder Bryan Petersen was interfered with by multiple fans during his opportunity to catch a ball, under Rule 2.00 INTERFERENCE (d)(1) and (2). After instant replay review, first base umpire and crew chief Joe West ruled Pence out under the provisions of spectator interference, Rule 3.16, and sent Phillies baserunner Ryan Howard back to first base. For the second time in less than a month, a manager was ejected arguing the instant replay decision: Charlie Manuel was ejected and elected to play the game under protest. On September 7, 2011, MLB VP of Baseball Operations Joe Torre denied the first ever protest associated with authorized instant replay usage. Changes for 2014 Instant replay was not expanded in 2012, and Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations Joe Torre confirmed that instant replay would again not be expanded in time for Opening Day 2013, putting off plans for another season. On August 15, 2013, Major League Baseball announced that it would expand its video review process for the 2014 season, granting managers one challenge over the first six innings of games and two from the seventh inning until the end of the game. Calls that are challenged would be reviewed by a crew in MLB headquarters in New York City, who make the final ruling. As part of the 2014 collective bargaining agreement between MLB's owners and players union (MLBPA), and approval by the umpires union (WUA), two additional elements were added to the replay rules. Instant replay was expanded to include fair and foul calls and balls that are caught or trapped by the player catching the ball. It also expanded interference reviews beyond the home run boundary to all walls. =2013 Arizona Fall League Testing= Following the conclusion of the 2013 World Series, MLB announced it would test expanded instant replay as proposed for 2014 for a week's slate of games in the Arizona Fall League.\\"Instant replay testing to be conducted at Arizona Fall League.\\" MLB (Press release).

According to its terms, managers will be allotted one challenge per game (two if the first challenge results in an overturned call) while the umpiring crew chief will be empowered to initiate a review in innings 7 and later. The umpires will also be allowed to review a home run call at any time. Once a call is challenged an umpire requests a video review, fellow umpires in New York's Replay Operations Center will watch video of the play in question using the \\"indisputable video evidence\\" standard when deciding whether to overturn a call. The following plays will be reviewable under the system: * Ground-rule doubles * Fan interference calls * Boundary calls (managers may not, however, challenge home run or potential home run calls) * Force plays at all bases, except whether a middle infielder touched second base during the attempt to \\"turn\\" a double play * Tag plays on the base paths‚Äîwhether a runner was tagged or whether the runner touched a base (an appeal is still required ahead of the latter) * Fair/foul calls on balls hit into the outfield * Catch/trap calls on balls hit into the outfield * Time plays (whether or not a run scored prior to the third out) * Whether a runner passed a preceding runner * Scorekeeping issues, including the count, number of outs, score or substitutions Judgment calls not specified above, including, but not limited to, pitches called ball or strike, obstruction, interference, the infield fly rule, and checked swings are not reviewable. On March 31, 2014, the first instant replay challenge logged was sent by former MLB.com logger Drew \\"Cashmere\\" Schaefer with the MLB Replay Tech in NYC being Timothy Akins as Chicago Cubs manager Rick Renteria challenged a potential double play in the top of fifth inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates, disputing the call on the field that pitcher Jeff Samardzija was out at first. The umpires confirmed the call on the field, and the Cubs lost the challenge. From announcement of the challenge to confirmation of the call, the process took 1 minute and 40 seconds, longer than MLB's hope for 60 to 90 seconds per review. Later that day, the first successful challenge took place when Atlanta Braves manager Fredi Gonz√°lez challenged the call of a Ryan Braun single. It was overturned to an out in a review that took 58 seconds, although the Braves lost the game to the Milwaukee Brewers 2-0; coincidentally, former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig was in attendance for the first successful challenge. Moments later, the aforementioned Cubs‚ÄìPirates game had the second overturned call (and the first in extra innings) when Emilio Bonifacio was called safe on a pickoff attempt by Bryan Morris. Pirates manager Clint Hurdle successfully challenged the call, and was said to influence the outcome of the game, a 1-0 Pirates victory. Finally, the first umpire-initiated review took place in a game between the Oakland Athletics and Cleveland Indians when umpire Mike Winters wanted to confirm that Oakland catcher John Jaso did not unnecessarily block the plate as Michael Brantley attempted to score. As of the 2014 All-Star Break, instant replay was generally well received by managers, players, and umpires. Managers challenged 606 calls, or an average of one every 2.35 games, of which 52% were overturned. Including situations where umpires request the Replay Operations Center to review a call, 47.7% of calls are overturned. However, MLB informally allows up to 30 seconds to have the team's video coordinator signal a call to the manager. When situations where the manager comes out on the field to await a decision from a team video coordinator are included, MLB estimates the percentage of calls overturned decreases to 21%. The average replay review takes one minute and fifty seconds, which is higher than MLB's original goal of 90 seconds per review. One side effect has been the addition of 12 new umpires, the most since 1999, to MLB staff, due to the need to staff the Replay Operations Center with two crews. However, statistics show that umpiring quality has remained constant despite the additions, with four out of the top seven umpires with reversals those who have umpired more than 1,600 games. Changes for 2015 In 2015, many changes regarding Instant Replay were made. At that point, managers could invoke instant replay from the dugout and would no longer be required to approach the calling umpire to challenge a call. Managers could hold play from the top step of the dugout by signaling to players and the home plate umpire that he is considering a challenge. A decision could be communicated verbally or with a hand signal. To challenge an inning-ending call, managers would be required to leave the dugout immediately in order to hold the defensive team on the field. Tag-up plays became reviewable, to help determine if a player touched the base before continuing or not. A manager would retain his challenge after every call that is overturned. In 2014, a manager retained his challenge only after the first overturned call. A manager must use a challenge in order to review whether a play at home plate included a violation of the rule governing home plate collisions. However, in the event that a manager is out of challenges after the start of the seventh inning, the Crew Chief may still choose to review whether there was a violation of the rule. During Postseason games, regular season tiebreaker games and the All-Star Game, managers would be given two challenges per game. Instant replay was not utilized during 2015 Spring Training, but it was in place for exhibition games at Major League ballparks prior to the start of the 2015 regular season.

Description and history The Union Church stands in the town center of Naples, on the south side of US 302, just east of the Naples Public Library. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and granite foundation. A two-stage square tower rises from the roof ridge, the first stage with corner pilasters, and the second with pilasters and louvered lancet-arched belfry openings. It is topped by a slender spire. The front facade, facing north, has pilastered corners rising to an entablature and a fully pedimented gable, which has a triangular louvered panel at its center. Identical entrances flank a sash window, each framed by pilasters and an entablature. The church was built in 1857 (the same year as the Methodist church a short distance west of here), and was originally shared by a Congregationalist group and two Free Will Baptist organizations. By the 1870s the size of these groups had dwindled to the point where they could apparently no longer support full-time ministers, and the building fell into intermittent use. It underwent some alteration in the 1950s, when it saw brief use by an Episcopalian congregation, but most of these changes have been reversed. It is now used as a community resource, hosting social events and occasional religious services.

The line runs from Baltimore to Halethorpe along the original Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) line, one of the oldest rail lines in the United States and the first passenger railroad line. At its east (north) end, it connects with the Philadelphia Subdivision; its west (south) end has a junction with the Capital Subdivision and the Old Main Line Subdivision. History Mount Clare to points south and west The B&O; began construction in 1828. The original terminal was located in Baltimore at Pratt and Poppleton Streets. This location, initially a temporary wooden shed, became known as the Mount Clare Station. The Mount Clare Shops, the first railroad manufacturing facility in the U.S., was also built in this area. The rail line exited the city in a southwesterly direction. The company encountered varied terrain that required several large cut and fill earthmoving operations. The B&O; built the Carrollton Viaduct, the first stone masonry bridge built for a U.S. railroad, during this project. The company provided an inaugural ride on the line from Pratt Street to the viaduct on New Year's Day 1830. The bridge, a National Historic Landmark, is still used by CSX today.The Carrollton Viaduct is located on the present-day Mount Clare Branch, about 1 mile (1.6 km) south of the Carroll junction on the main line. The B&O; rebuilt the main line tracks in the 1870s. Construction of the tracks continued southward to the Patapsco River near Halethorpe, and then turned west following the river. Today Halethorpe is the southern terminus of the Baltimore Terminal Subdivision. The railroad offered the first regular passenger train service in the U.S. in May 1830, from Baltimore to Ellicott's Mills (now called Ellicott City) along the Patapsco. The first permanent train station, the Ellicott City Station, was completed in 1831. Mount Winans Yard. The set of three tracks on the right is the current CSX main line. The pair of tracks on the extreme left is the Mount Clare Branch, part of the original B&O; main line, leading to the Carrollton Viaduct. Also in 1831, the B&O; built a junction, known as Relay, just north of the river near Halethorpe and began construction of the Washington Branch south toward Washington, D.C.. (This branch was later named the Capital Subdivision.) The section of the line proceeding west from Relay, along the Patapsco, eventually became known as the Old Main Line. The B&O; built a branch line to Locust Point, on the Baltimore harbor, during 1848-49. The branch had a rail yard and terminal that was used for shipping coal and bulk minerals, and later for grain and merchandise. A permanent station at Mount Clare was completed c. 1851. The railroad opened the larger Camden Station nearby in 1857, and expanded it in 1865. In 1875 new roundhouses were built at Bailey's (Ostend Street, near the site of the present-day M&T; Bank Stadium) and Riverside Yard on Locust Point. Another branch line and a larger shipping terminal at Curtis Bay was opened in 1884. Subsequently all coal traffic was routed to the new terminal. The B&O; built two larger roundhouses at Riverside in 1907 (totaling 50 stalls) and no longer used the Bailey's facilities for locomotive operations. Baltimore to Philadelphia Mount Royal Station in 1961 The B&O;'s initial route from Baltimore to Philadelphia was on the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad. The B&O; operated a car float across the Baltimore harbor to bring trains from Philadelphia to connections at Locust Point and to the south and west. By the early 1880s this line was controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad, which proceeded to deny access to the B&O.; The B&O; then built the Philadelphia Branch (known formally as the Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad). To move trains more efficiently around the city it also built the Baltimore Belt Line and the Howard Street Tunnel during 1891 to 1895, at considerable expense. The car float operation was shut down after the new facilities opened. The Mount Royal Station, along the Belt Line, opened in 1896. This became the second of two Baltimore stops for the Royal Blue passenger train, which began service in 1890 between Washington and New York City. (The other stop was Camden Station.) Passenger traffic declined significantly after World War II and the B&O; closed the Mount Royal station in 1961. Locomotives entering Baileys Wye, heading north to the Howard Street Tunnel.

On 8 December, Phouma relieved Kong Le from his command, but the next day Kong Le deposed Souvanna Phouma (who flew to Phnom Penh with Prince Boun Om and his other ministers) and Pholsena, then Minister of the Interior, was appointed premier, who was unrecognised. A few days later Phoumi took Vientiane and installed Boun Oum as premier. After more than a year of negotiations a coalition government was formed under the leadership of Phouma. Pholsena, who served as interior minister in the three-week-old government, became information minister in August. Then from 1962 to 1963, he served as the foreign minister under the coalition government of Phouma. Assassination Pholsena returned home from a party at the King's residence in Vientiane. Pholsena and his wife arrived at their newly renovated villa. As the couple left the car, Quinim mounted the steps and one of the soldiers who was assigned to protect his villa, lance corporal Chy Song, stepped forward and fired from his submachine gun that killed him and seriously wounded his wife, who was wounded in both legs. In his signed confession, Quinim's assassin, Song, charged Quinim with trying to overthrow the government and bribing neutralist officers to defect to the Pathet Lao.https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32241845.pdf See also * Souvanna Phouma References Bibliography * Stieglitz, Perry, In a little kingdom, M.E.

It is commonly known as the eastern North American destroying angel or just as the destroying angel, although the fungus shares this latter name with three other lethal white Amanita species, A. ocreata, A. verna and A. virosa. The fruit bodies are found on the ground in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests of eastern North America south to Mexico, but are rare in western North America; the fungus has also been found in pine plantations in Colombia. The mushroom has a smooth white cap that can reach up to across, and a stipe, up to long by thick, that has a delicate white skirt-like ring near the top. The bulbous stipe base is covered with a membranous sac-like volva. The white gills are free from attachment to the stalk and crowded closely together. As the species name suggests, A. bisporigera typically bears two spores on the basidia, although this characteristic is not as immutable as was once thought. Amanita bisporigera was described as a new species in 1906. It is classified in the section Phalloideae of the genus Amanita together with other amatoxin-containing species. Amatoxins are cyclic peptides which inhibit the enzyme RNA polymerase II and interfere with various cellular functions. The first symptoms of poisoning appear 6 to 24 hours after consumption, followed by a period of apparent improvement, then by symptoms of liver and kidney failure, and death after four days or more. Amanita bisporigera closely resembles a few other white amanitas, including the equally deadly A. virosa and A. verna. These species, difficult to distinguish from A. bisporigera based on visible field characteristics, do not have two-spored basidia, and do not stain yellow when a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide is applied. The DNA of A. bisporigera has been partially sequenced, and the genes responsible for the production of amatoxins have been determined. Taxonomy, classification, and phylogeny Amanita bisporigera was first described scientifically in 1906 by American botanist George Francis Atkinson in a publication by Cornell University colleague Charles E. Lewis. The type locality was Ithaca, New York, where several collections were made. In his 1941 monograph of world Amanita species, √âdouard-Jean Gilbert transferred the species to his new genus Amanitina, but this genus is now considered synonymous with Amanita. In 1944, William Murrill described the species Amanita vernella, collected from Gainesville, Florida; that species is now thought to be synonymous with A. bisporigera after a 1979 examination of its type material revealed basidia that were mostly 2-spored. Amanita phalloides var. striatula, a poorly known taxon originally described from the United States in 1902 by Charles Horton Peck, is considered by Amanita authority Rodham Tulloss to be synonymous with A. bisporigera. Vernacular names for the mushroom include \\"destroying angel\\", \\"deadly amanita\\", \\"white death cap\\", \\"angel of death\\" and \\"eastern North American destroying angel\\". Amanita bisporigera belongs to section Phalloideae of the genus Amanita, which contains some of the deadliest Amanita species, including A. phalloides and A. virosa. This classification has been upheld with phylogenetic analyses, which demonstrate that the toxin-producing members of section Phalloideae form a clade‚Äîthat is, they derive from a common ancestor. In 2005, Zhang and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of several white-bodied toxic Amanita species, most of which are found in Asia. Their results support a clade containing A. bisporigera, A. subjunquillea var. alba, A. exitialis, and A. virosa. The Guangzhou destroying angel (Amanita exitialis) has two-spored basidia, like A. bisporigera. Description The white gills are crowded closely together, and the stipe base is bulbous. The cap is in diameter and, depending on its age, ranges in shape from egg-shaped to convex to somewhat flattened. The cap surface is smooth and white, sometimes with a pale tan- or cream-colored tint in the center. The surface is either dry or, when the environment is moist, slightly sticky. The flesh is thin and white, and does not change color when bruised. The margin of the cap, which is rolled inwards in young specimens, does not have striations (grooves), and lacks volval remnants. The gills, also white, are crowded closely together. They are either free from attachment to the stipe or just barely reach it. The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend all the way to the stipe) are numerous, and gradually narrow. Surfaces turn yellow when stained with potassium hydroxide solution.The white stipe is by thick, solid (i.e., not hollow), and tapers slightly upward. The surface, in young specimens especially, is frequently floccose (covered with tufts of soft hair), fibrillose (covered with small slender fibers), or squamulose (covered with small scales); there may be fine grooves along its length. The bulb at the base of the stipe is spherical or nearly so. The delicate ring on the upper part of the stipe is a remnant of the partial veil that extends from the cap margin to the stalk and covers the gills during development. It is white, thin, membranous, and hangs like a skirt. When young, the mushrooms are enveloped in a membrane called the universal veil, which stretches from the top of the cap to the bottom of the stipe, imparting an oval, egg-like appearance. In mature fruit bodies, the veil's remnants form a membrane around the base, the volva, like an eggshell-shaped cup. On occasion, however, the volva remains underground or gets torn up during development. It is white, sometimes lobed, and may become pressed closely to the stipe.Jenkins, 1986, pp. 140‚Äì41. The volva is up to in height (measured from the base of the bulb), and is about 2 mm thick midway between the top and the base attachment. The mushroom's odor has been described as \\"pleasant to somewhat nauseous\\", becoming more cloying as the fruit body ages. The cap flesh turns yellow when a solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH, 5‚Äì10%) is applied (a common chemical test used in mushroom identification). This characteristic chemical reaction is shared with A. ocreata and A. virosa, although some authors have expressed doubt about the identity of North American A. virosa, suggesting those collections may represent four-spored A. bisporigera. Tulloss suggests that reports of A. bisporigera that do not turn yellow with KOH were actually based on white forms of A. phalloides. Findings from the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona and in central Mexico, although \\"nearly identical\\" to A. bisporigera, do not stain yellow with KOH; their taxonomic status has not been investigated in detail. Microscopic features Spores are roughly spherical and translucentThe spore print of A. bisporigera, like most Amanita, is white. The spores are roughly spherical, thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), amyloid, and measure 7.8‚Äì9.6 by 7.0‚Äì9.0 Œºm. The cap cuticle is made of partially gelatinized, filamentous interwoven hyphae, 2‚Äì6 Œºm in diameter. The tissue of the gill is bilateral, meaning it diverges from the center of the gill to its outer edge. The subhymenium is ramose‚Äîcomposed of relatively thin branching, unclamped hyphae. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, thin- walled, without clamps, with dimensions of 34‚Äì45 by 4‚Äì11 Œºm. They are typically two-spored, although rarely three- or four-spored forms have been found. Although the two-spored basidia are a defining characteristic of the species, there is evidence of a tendency to shift towards producing four- spored basidia as the fruiting season progresses. The volva is composed almost exclusively of densely interwoven filamentous hyphae, 2‚Äì10 Œºm in diameter, that are sparsely to moderately branched. There are few small inflated cells, which are mostly spherical to broadly elliptic. The tissue of the stipe is made of abundant, sparsely branched, filamentous hyphae, without clamps, measuring 2‚Äì5 Œºm in diameter. The inflated cells are club-shaped, longitudinally oriented, and up to 2‚Äì3 by 15.7 Œºm. The annulus is made of abundant moderately branched filamentous hyphae, measuring 2‚Äì6 Œºm in diameter. The inflated cells are sparse, broadly elliptic to pear-shaped, and are rarely larger than 31 by 22 Œºm. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent, but there may be cylindrical to sac-like cells of the partial veil on the gill edges; these cells are hyaline and measure 24‚Äì34 by 7‚Äì16 Œºm. Development of basidia, as illustrated by Lewis in 1906In 1906 Charles E. Lewis studied and illustrated the development of the basidia in order to compare the nuclear behavior of the two-spored with that of the four-spored forms. Initially (1), the young basidium, appearing as a club-shaped branch from the subhymenium, is filled with cytoplasm and contains two primary nuclei, which have distinct nucleoli. As the basidium grows larger, the membranes of the two nuclei contact (2), and then the membrane disappears at the point of contact (3). The two primary nuclei remain distinct for a short time, but eventually the two nuclei fuse completely to form a larger secondary nucleus with a single secondary nucleolus (4, 5). The basidium increases in size after the primary nuclei fuse, and the nucleus migrates towards the end of the basidia (6, 7). During this time, the nucleus develops vacuoles \\"filled by the nuclear sap in the living cell\\". Chromosomes are produced from the nucleolar threads, and align transversely near the apex of the basidium, connected by spindles (8‚Äì10). The chromosomes then move to the poles, forming the daughter nuclei that occupy different positions in the basidium; the daughters now have a structure similar to that of the parent nuclei (11). The two nuclei then divide to form four nuclei, similar to fungi with four-spored basidia (12, 13). The four nuclei crowd together at some distance from the end of the basidium to form an irregular mass (14). Shortly thereafter, the sterigmata (slender projections of the basidia that attach the spores) begin to form (15), and cytoplasm begins to pass through the sterigmata to form the spores (16). Although Lewis was not able to clearly determine from observation alone whether the contents of two or four nuclei passed through the sterigmata, he deduced, by examining older basidia with mature spores, that only two nuclei enter the spores (16, 17). Toxicity Œ±-amanitin, principal toxic component of A. bisporigera Amanita bisporigera is considered the most toxic North American Amanita mushroom, with little variation in toxin content between different fruit bodies. Three subtypes of amatoxin have been described: Œ±-, Œ≤, and Œ≥-amanitin. The principal amatoxin, Œ±-amanitin, is readily absorbed across the intestine, and 60% of the absorbed toxin is excreted into bile and undergoes enterohepatic circulation; the kidneys clear the remaining 40%. The toxin inhibits the enzyme RNA polymerase II, thereby interfering with DNA transcription, which suppresses RNA production and protein synthesis. This causes cellular necrosis, especially in cells which are initially exposed and have rapid rates of protein synthesis. This process results in severe acute liver dysfunction and, ultimately, liver failure. Amatoxins are not broken down by boiling, freezing, or drying. Roughly 0.2 to 0.4 milligrams of Œ±-amanitin is present in 1 gram of A. bisporigera; the lethal dose in humans is less than 0.1 mg/kg body weight. One mature fruit body can contain 10‚Äì12 mg of Œ±-amanitin, enough for a lethal dose. The Œ±-amanitin concentration in the spores is about 17% that of the fruit body tissues. A. bisporigera also contains the phallotoxin phallacidin, structurally related to the amatoxins but considered less poisonous because of poor absorption. Poisonings (from similar white amanitas) have also been reported in domestic animals, including dogs, cats, and cows. The first reported poisonings resulting in death from the consumption of A. bisporigera were from near San Antonio, Mexico, in 1957, where a rancher, his wife, and three children consumed the fungus; only the man survived. Amanita poisoning is characterized by the following distinct stages: the incubation stage is an asymptomatic period which ranges from 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. In the gastrointestinal stage, about 6 to 16 hours after ingestion, there is onset of abdominal pain, explosive vomiting, and diarrhea for up to 24 hours, which may lead to dehydration, severe electrolyte imbalances, and shock. These early symptoms may be related to other toxins such as phalloidin. In the cytotoxic stage, 24 to 48 hours after ingestion, clinical and biochemical signs of liver damage are observed, but the patient is typically free of gastrointestinal symptoms. The signs of liver dysfunction such as jaundice, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and hemorrhage appear. Later, there is an increase in the levels of prothrombin and blood levels of ammonia, and the signs of hepatic encephalopathy and/or kidney failure appear. The risk factors for mortality that have been reported are age younger than 10 years, short latency period between ingestion and onset of symptoms, severe coagulopathy (blood clotting disorder), severe hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), and rising serum creatinine levels. Similar species The color and general appearance of A. bisporigera are similar to those of A. verna and A. virosa. A. bisporigera is at times smaller and more slender than either A. verna or A. virosa, but it varies considerably in size; therefore size is not a reliable diagnostic characteristic. A. virosa fruits in autumn‚Äîlater than A. bisporigera. A. elliptosperma is less common but widely distributed in the southeastern United States, while A. ocreata is found on the West Coast and in the Southwest. Other similar toxic North American species include Amanita magnivelaris, which has a cream-colored, rather thick, felted-submembranous, skirt-like ring, and A. virosiformis, which has elongated spores that are 3.9‚Äì4.7 by 11.7‚Äì13.4 Œºm.Jenkins, 1986, p. 146. Neither A. elliptosperma nor A. magnivelaris typically turn yellow with the application of KOH; the KOH reaction of A. virosiformis has not been reported.Jenkins, 1986, p. 141. Leucoagaricus leucothites is another all-white mushroom with an annulus, free gills, and white spore print, but it lacks a volva and has thick-walled dextrinoid (staining red-brown in Melzer's reagent) egg-shaped spores with a pore. A. bisporigera may also be confused with the larger edible species Agaricus silvicola, the \\"horse-mushroom\\". Like many white amanitas, young fruit bodies of A. bisporigera, still enveloped in the universal veil, can be confused with puffball species, but a longitudinal cut of the fruit body reveals internal structures in the Amanita that are absent in puffballs. In 2006, seven members of the Hmong community living in Minnesota were poisoned with A. bisporigera because they had confused it with edible paddy straw mushrooms (Volvariella volvacea) that grow in Southeast Asia. Habitat and distribution Like most other Amanita species, A. bisporigera is thought to form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and giving the tree greater access to soil nutrients.Jenkins, 1986, p. 5. Fruit bodies of Amanita bisporigera are found on the ground growing either solitarily, scattered, or in groups in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests; they tend to appear during summer and early fall. The fruit bodies are commonly found near oak, but have been reported in birch-aspen areas in the west. It is most commonly found in eastern North America, and rare in western North America. It is widely distributed in Canada, and its range extends south to Mexico. The species has also been found in Colombia, where it may have been introduced from trees exported for use in pine plantations. Genome sequencing The Amanita Genome Project was begun in Jonathan Walton's lab at Michigan State University in 2004 as part of their ongoing studies of Amanita bisporigera. The purpose of the project is to determine the genes and genetic controls associated with the formation of mycorrhizae, and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of toxin production. The genome of A. bisporigera has been sequenced using a combination of automated Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing, and the genome sequence information is publicly searchable. The sequence data enabled the researchers to identify the genes responsible for amatoxin and phallotoxin biosynthesis, AMA1 and PHA1. The cyclic peptides are synthesized on ribosomes, and require proline-specific peptidases from the prolyl oligopeptidase family for processing. The genetic sequence information from A. bisporigera has been used to identify molecular polymorphisms in the related A. phalloides. These single-nucleotide polymorphisms may be used as population genetic markers to study phylogeography and population genetics. Sequence information has also been employed to show that A. bisporigera lacks many of the major classes of secreted enzymes that break down the complex polysaccharides of plant cell walls, like cellulose. In contrast, saprobic fungi like Coprinopsis cinerea and Galerina marginata, which break down organic matter to obtain nutrients, have a more complete complement of cell wall-degrading enzymes. Although few ectomycorrhizal fungi have yet been tested in this way, the authors suggest that the absence of plant cell wall-degrading ability may correlate with the ectomycorrhizal ecological niche.

The Knights recorded their worst ever start to a season (13 straight losses) and were consigned to last place for the entire year. They did however win 8 of their last 11 games thanks to the return of superstar Andrew Johns, but it wasn't enough for them to avoid the wooden spoon. They also recorded their then equal worst ever defeat - a 50-0 thrashing by the Parramatta Eels in round 14 (this was reversed in round 20). During this match, an EnergyAustralia Stadium attendant ran onto the field, trying to tackle Parramatta's Daniel Wagon before he scored in the 78th minute. Notable wins in 2005 included wins against Penrith in round 16 (a 28-24 win after trailing 14-0 at halftime), the Knights' first win for 2005, in round 18 against eventual runners-up North Queensland, and then a six-match winning run which included the scalps of eventual minor premiers Parramatta (who then failed to make the Grand Final), defending premiers the Bulldogs (who then failed to make the finals altogether) and the Warriors (whose greatest player Stacey Jones was playing his final home match). It culminated in a 44-14 thrashing of Cronulla (the Knights led 34-0 at halftime before easing off in the second half), the club's biggest win for the season. A loss to the St. George Illawarra Dragons in the final round confirmed Newcastle's wooden spoon, but it was actually the Rabbitohs' win over the Sharks which confirmed Newcastle's last placing for the season in the first place.

Period of steady immigration Together with German and Italian immigrants, the Catholic population in the United States increased from 4 percent at the beginning of the pontificate of Pius IX in 1846 to 11 percent in 1870.Franzen 364 Some 700 priests existed in the U.S. in 1846 compared to 6000 in 1878. Pope Pius IX contributed to this development by establishing new Church regions and the installation of capable American bishops.Schmidlin 207 Creation of modern ecclesiastical structures Pius IX is the father of much of the modern American church structure by creating many existing dioceses and archdioceses in the U.S. such as the Roman Catholic Dioceses of Portland, Springfield, Illinois, Burlington, Cleveland, Columbus, Galveston-Houston, Providence, Fort Wayne-South Bend, Kansas City in Kansas, Saint Paul and Minneapolis, San Francisco, Seattle, San Antonio and others.Schmidlin 208 Some of his creations do not exist anymore: On 24 July 1846, Pius IX divided the existing Oregon vicariate apostolic into three dioceses: Oregon City (Oregonopolitanus); Walla Walla (Valle Valliensis); and Vancouver Island (Insula Vancouver). New sees in the Western states On 29 July 1850, the Diocese of Oregon City was elevated to an archdiocese with Archbishop Blanchet continuing to serve as its first archbishop. In 1850, Pius IX erected seats at Monterey and Santa Fe in the Spanish-Mexican territories recently added to the United States and in Savannah, Wheeling, and Nesqually, and made the Indian Territory a vicariate under a bishop.Shea 206 Support for synods and meetings Pius IX supported Diocesan synods and regular meetings, and granted all wishes of the American bishops regarding enlargements of their rights and privileges. In 1849, from his exile in Gaeta, he politely turned down an invitation to visit the U.S. He wrote, \\"...nothing could afford us more pleasure, nothing could be more grateful to our hearts than to enjoy the presence and conversation of yourself and the venerable brethren ... but in the existing times and circumstances, it would be impossible for us to comply with your invitation, as your wisdom will easily understand\\".Shea 171‚Äì172 The enormous growth of the Catholic Church in the U.S. and the genuine admiration in the early years for his liberal pontificate resulted in the United States establishing diplomatic relations with the Papal States on 7 April 1848. This lasted until 1867, when domestic pressures forced a closing of relations.Schmidlin 211 The Vatican never had an ambassador in Washington, because the U.S. government refused to accept a Catholic priest as papal nuncio.Schmidlin 210-211 Pius IX pushed for an American College in Rome for future American priests and promised his personal financial support. A small college was founded in 1859 under Rev John McCloskey; it was greatly expanded under Pius XII in 1956. Political involvement during the Civil War During the American Civil War, Catholics oriented themselves to John Hughes (the Archbishop of New York) in the Union and to Jean-Marie Odin (the Archbishop of New Orleans) in the Confederate States. Abraham Lincoln asked Pope Pius IX to elevate Hughes into the College of Cardinals,Schmidlin 210 but Pius declined to do so. A decade later, Pius did elevate John McCloskey, Hughes's successor, to the College of Cardinals. Pope Pius IX never supported the Confederacy, but he did call for peace and offered mediation. He stressed the necessity of emancipation. Confederate diplomat Ambrose Dudley Mann met with the pope in December 1863 and received a letter addressed to the \\"Honorable President of the Confederate States of America.\\" This was simple courtesy, though it had no legal effect. The Confederacy used it in propaganda to claim papal support. For example, Robert E. Lee thought the pope was \\"the only sovereign... in Europe who recognized our poor Confederacy\\". In fact, no diplomatic relations or recognitions were extended in either direction. In his dispatch to Richmond, Mann claimed a great diplomatic achievement for himself; he believed the letter was \\"a positive recognition of our Government\\". Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin told Mann it was \\"a mere inferential recognition, unconnected with political action or the regular establishment of diplomatic relations\\" and thus did not assign it the weight of formal recognition.Don H.

The bishop conferences formulated requests to the German State and issued pastoral directives. The Pope welcomed this association, refused however to give permission for the holding of a German regional council. The Prussian constitution of 1850 guaranteed complete freedom to the Catholic Church. Catholics under a Protestant empire Decisive military victories of Prussia against all German States and Austria in K√∂niggr√§tz in 1866, and of the German States in Sedan against France in 1870 and the creation of Second German Empire in 1870 with a Protestant emperor were viewed in Berlin as a victory of Protestantism over Catholicism. The outcome of the First Vatican Council with the definition of Papal infallibility raised Protestant and liberal Catholic fears of papal interference in German affairs and resulted with the Kulturkampf by Otto von Bismarck in drastic restrictions for the Catholic Church in the areas of education, sermon preaching, the formation of its priests and the functions of bishops. Five of eleven Prussian bishops were arrested.Franzen 364 Several Religious and religious congregations were outlawed and Jesuits had to leave the country with a law of 7 July 1872. They were only readmitted in 1917. Opposition to priests and bishops Catholics were considered loyal to the Pope and not to Germany did not have the same civil rights or access to government positions as did Germans of Protestant or Jewish faith. By 1878, two-thirds of the Catholic bishops were forcefully removed from their positions and over 1000 parishes were without priests. Germany attempted to further weaken the Catholic Church by expropriating churches and institutions and turning them over to the Old Catholics, a small sect of liberal Catholics, which split from the main Church after Vatican One, without being able to gain much support despite of the official State interventions. The Protestant House of the Grand Duchy of Baden claimed the right not only to appoint Bishops but also Parish priests and other Catholic Church employees.Shea 200 The government declared, that Catholic seminarians must, before they could be ordained, undergo a State examination. Despite of protests by Pius IX, eighty-year-old Archbishop Hermann von Vicari refused and was put on a criminal trial resulting in his 24-hour government supervision by the State Police. His priests were imprisoned, exiled or fined. Catholicism getting stronger Despite of, or some say, because of the ongoing persecution, Catholicism in Germany actually got stronger. Its political representatives of the Centre Party gained in popularity and its press and local organizations flourished. After the death of Pius IX, von Bismarck attempted to make peace with his more diplomatic successor Pope Leo XIII and over time rescinded most but not all of the discriminatory legislation against the Catholic Church and populations. On 27 May 1887, Leo XIII announced the formal end of the KulturkampfFranzen 369 Pantheon around 1870 References G Category:History of Catholicism in Germany ","title":"Pope Pius IX and Germany"},{"id":"24918985","title":"Phi (KinKi Kids album)"},{"id":"24919024","text":"On the Trail with Miss Snail Pail is a 2009 short documentary film that follows Colleen Flanigan, aka Miss Snail Pail, as she provides a snail removal service that recycles the garden pests into food.

His father was an officer in the British Indian Army who later served in the Pakistan Army. He was educated at the Bannu where he did his matriculation and attended the Emerson College in Multan, Punjab where he secured his graduation. In 1963, he was accepted to join the Air Force Academy in Risalpur where he received his flight training on the Cessna T-37T, and graduated in General Duty Pilot (GD) course in 1965. P/Off. Alvi participated in the second war with India in 1965, touring his duty as \\"Mail Runners\\" to convey messages from one base to another, served on this assignment until the war was ended.

He returned to Pakistan to participate in the third war with India and flew the Quick Reaction Close Support Missions especially in Shakargarh, where the battle with the Indian IAF was the most turbulent. After the war in 1971, Flt.Lt Alvi was sent to join the faculty at the Air Force Academy and served as a flight instructor on the flight manuals on the F-7P, a Chinese variant of MiG-21F. Yom Kippur War Pakistani prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto sought to maintain close relationships with the Arab world. When the Yom Kippur war broke out, Alvi was one of the Pakistan Air Force fighter pilots who volunteered to go to the Middle East to support Egypt and Syria. By the time they arrived, however, Egypt and Israel had already concluded a ceasefire and only Syria remained in an active state of war against Israel. Alvi, who was serving as a Flight Lieutenant in 1973, joined the Syrian Air Force along with a Pakistani Squadron Leader Arif Manzoor. The Pakistani fighter pilots flew in a formation using the call-sign \\"Shahbaz\\" under the command of Squadron Leader Arif Manzoor.http://pavocavalry.wordpress.com/2008/09/17/shahbaz-over- golan-1973-war-golan-idf-click-on-top-to-enlarge/ The Aerial fight over Golan On 26 April 1974, PAF fighter pilot Flight Lieutenant Sattar Alvi on deputation to No. 67A Squadron, Syrian Air Force (SAF) was flying a SAF MiG-21F-13 (Serial No. 1863) out of Dumayr Air Base, Syria in an eight-ship formation with a fellow PAF pilot and the Flight Leader, Squadron Leader Arif Manzoor. Alvi came to worldwide international notice when he shot down the IAF's Mirage IIICJ flown by Captain M. Lutz.

The latter turned out to be Mirages and a moment later Alvi, in Arif's formation saw the No 2 Mirage breaking towards him. All this time, heavy radio jamming by Israeli ground stations was making things difficult but the Pakistani pilots were used to such tactics. He managed to shoot down the jet piloted by Captain Lutz while the wingman quickly disengaged. Honours After the engagements, Flight Lieutenant Captain Sattar Alvi and Shahbaz formation leader Squadron Leader Major Arif Manzoor were awarded two of Syria's highest decorations for gallantry, the Wisaam Faris and Wisaam Shuja'at in 1973 by the President of Syria Hafez al-Assad in a public ceremony.

Bagley, History of King County Washington, The S.J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago-Seattle, 1929, Volume III, pages 781-785. A slow migration west Butterworth was born in 1847 in Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts. His paternal grandfather, Noah Butterworth, served in the American Revolution. His father was William Ray Butterworth; his mother's name was Eliza n√©e Norwood, also from an old New England family. In 1857 his family moved to Wright County, Minnesota, where his father worked as a millwright for six years. This was during the period of the Sioux Wars in that frontier region. When the American Civil War, broke out, Edgar Butterworth tried to enlist but he was too young. In 1863, the family returned to Massachusetts. From the age of 16‚Äîthat is, roughly from the time of the family's return to Massachusetts‚Äîhe was the prime breadwinner in his family. He worked for a time as a hatter; then, still in his teens and despite a limited formal education, he began to study law and was admitted to the bar in Massachusetts just after he reached the age of 21. In 1869, he married Grace M. Whipple, a direct descendant of William Whipple, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. She died only two years into the marriage, after bearing a child, Gilbert M. Butterworth. In 1873, Butterworth moved to Saint Louis, Missouri where he again worked as a hatter. Also in that year, he remarried to Maria L. Gillespie. They relocated to Fort Scott, Kansas and in 1876 to the rangelands of southwest Kansas, where he became a cattleman. He also hauled the bones of dead bison to the nearest railroad where he received US$10 per ton (907 kg). There, on the plains of Kansas, he also had his first occasion to make a coffin. Traveling with his team and wagon, he encountered a settler in front of a \\"dugout\\" home, grieving for his wife and newborn child, both of whom had just died. With no lumber available on the grasslands, Butterworth fashioned a coffin from his own wagon box. Becoming an undertaker In 1881 the Butterworths moved farther west, to Washington, arriving in Chehalis in August of that year. He came with the intent of engaging in stock-raising, but that enterprise was not yet under way in Eastern Washington and Butterworth correctly gauged that Washington west of the Cascade Range was not cattle country. Instead, he built the first steam-powered flour mill west of the Cascades. The following spring the Butterworths relocated a short distance to Centerville, (later Centralia), where Butterworth set up a small furniture business. He served as a member of the first city council of Centralia and later as the city's mayor; he also served two terms was in the state legislature. When an epidemic of \\"black diphtheria\\" hit the region, Butterworth was called upon to make coffins, which is the point at which he effectively entered the undertaking business. Initially continuing in the furniture business, he also went into the business of selling coffins; he stocked a line of ready made coffins manufactured in Olympia, Washington. In 1892, by now a successful businessman, he relocated to Seattle, where he went into the undertaking business in a bigger way. He purchased a controlling interest in the Cross & Co.

Clarence Bagley credits him as the likely coiner of the terms mortuary and mortician. He owned the first hearse north of the Columbia River. During Butterworth's lifetime, his business annually forgave the debts of customers who were not able to pay. Butterworth & Sons were also early adopters of the embalming techniques that now distinguish American funerary traditions from those more common in Western Europe. He was a member of numerous fraternal organizations. He helped organize the Seattle lodges of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and the Ancient Order of United Workmen, and was also a member of the Knights of Pythias, the Independent Order of Foresters, the Woodmen of the World, the Royal Arcanum and the Independent Order of Good Templars, as well as being a charter member of the Alaskan Brotherhood Association, and a life member Seattle's Arctic Club. He was an active member of Temple Baptist Church, but also a practicing spiritualist. Inevitably, not all of the corpses handled by Butterworth had died peacefully. During the years of the Yukon Gold Rush (which began in 1897), parts of Seattle were dangerous and violent. Undertakers were paid $50 per body to take dead bodies off the street; Butterworth & Sons partook of that business. Butterworth, the city's leading undertaking business of the period, also handled many victims of the Spanish flu pandemic. Later, when health faddist doctor Linda Burfield Hazzard was convicted over one of the several patients she starved to death, Butterworth & Sons were implicated in the scandal, because they had cremated one of her victims, then produced a different, less emaciated body for the funeral. The mortuary was not convicted of any wrongdoing, but Hazzard went to prison.

This did not stop, however, Church life in France from flourishing during much of Pius IX's pontificate. Concord between liberal and conservative factions When Pius IX assumed the papacy in 1846, French Catholics were divided into a liberal fraction under Charles Forbes Ren√© de Montalembert and a conservative fraction under Louis Veuillot. They agreed on right to private schools, freedom of instruction, financial support by the State and a rejection of gallicanism.Schmidlin 120-121 Pius addressed the French bishops with his encyclical Inter Multiplices in which he asked for concord of mind and will among the French.Shea 207 Under Napoleon III, French Catholics got much of what they wanted. Napoleon III, because of his defense of the Papal States, was also seen as a defender of the Church and of Catholic interests.  Blossoming of Church life in France  French religious life blossomed under Pius IX. Many French Catholics wished the dogmatization of Papal infallibility and the assumption of Mary in the forthcoming ecumenical council.Civilta Catolica, February 6, 1869. The French bishops, with some notable exceptions were faithful to the Holy See. During the pontificate of Pius IX, some five Catholic Universities were founded in the cities of Lille, Angers, Lyon and Toulouse, in which the clerics were educated in a strict, although some argued, scientifically less than desirable manner.Shea 208 ff 1849 attack on the papal states In April 1849, General Oudinot's expeditionary force made its direct attack, and the Constituent Assembly in Rome passed a resolution of protest (7 May 1849), French President Louis Napoleon (the future Napoleon III of France) encouraged Pius IX and assured him of reinforcements from France. The Pope appealed for support, and Napoleon -- who had engaged in a liberal insurrection in the states of the Church himself in 1831--now sent troops that crushed the republic (29 June), although Pius IX did not return to Rome until April 1850. Alliance between Cavour and Napoleon III Napoleon III and Cavour (Premier to Victor Emmanuel) agreed to war on Austria. Following the Battle of Magenta (4 July 1859) the Austrian forces withdrew from the Papal States, precipitating their loss to Sardinia- Piedmont. Revolutionaries in Romagna called upon Sardinia-Piedmont for annexation. In February 1860, Victor Emmanuel II demanded Umbria and the Marches; when his demand was refused, he took them by force. Reliance on French and Austrian soldiers The Papal States were coming under increased pressure from anti-papal nationalists--notably Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia- Piedmont (later king of Italy). The Pope was obliged to rely on French and Austrian soldiers to maintain order and protect his territories. An army of volunteers was created in 1860: the Papal zouaves (zuavi pontifici) under the command of general de La Morici√®re. They came from different countries including France, Holland (the majority), Belgium, Canada and England. Even from the United States and from Italy as well. French troops in Rome until 1870 The French troops remained in Rome to protect the status quo until 1870 (see September Convention), while the Risorgimento united the remainder of Italy, leaving the block of the Papal States in the center. Thus, for twenty years, the pope ruled the Church State under the protection of French military forces, a fact which further limited his popularity among fervent Italian nationalists. Pius was met with a sullen receptionRapport, 361 on his return to Rome, the Romans being unimpressed by the return of the pontiff at the point of French bayonets. He blessed the French troops, held a Te Deum and signalized his return to Rome by an extension of his 1846 amnesty and by a new Indulgence.

It was one of the largest county councils in the country. It is home to a population of around 1.6 million, living on some 5,000 square kilometres in the central part of the country. The Nakuru area has a rich history, with human settlements dating back more than 3,000 years. The population is very diverse, with residents that have migratory background from different parts of the country. According to 2002 government statistics, on a population total of 1,312,555, the youth population up to age 25 years was 56%. The percentage of pre-primary and primary school going age residents was 31%, and the County‚Äôs total labour force population (age 15-64) was 54%. The population growth rate is 3.4%. The rural population is estimated to be 65%, with the remaining 35% living in towns and villages of 2,000 inhabitants and over. The County has nine towns with a population of over 2,000 people. There are about 400,000 households, 25% of which are female headed. The number of disabled is 3% and the absolute poverty in the rural areas is 45% and in the urban areas 41%. History Nakuru County is the home of pre-historic mankind since a million years. Some 3,500 years ago at five kilometers from what is now Nakuru Town, was a village of about 1,000 people and semi-permanent homes. In the colonial days, the area attracted white settlers who successfully began to exploit its agricultural potential. Nakuru was linked to the Uganda railway and became a centre of trade and industrial activity. The County Council of Nakuru was established in 1974 as one of the Local authorities of Kenya charged with the responsibility of providing social services to its residents. The administrative set-up follows an organization of local authorities suitable for a developing country like Kenya, with 50 elected Councillors representing 50 wards and 19 nominated Councillors. The Council Chairman is Councillor John Murigu Kamau and the Vice Chairman is Councillor Wilfred Kipyegon R. Kirui (following 2009 elections). The County has in its jurisdiction sizeable towns, including Gilgil where a strategic telecommunication equipment factory is situated, and Subukia in the valley between Nakuru and Nyeri towns. One of the largest volcanic craters in the world is located here: Menengai Crater with a diameter of 12 km. At the time of Independence in 1963, it was realized that building a County Hall with offices was essential for a more economic and effective control of the new administrative and technical organization. It was estimated that the new County Hall would cost ¬£50,000, inclusive of the Council Chamber. Plans were approved and realized, and the County Hall was officially opened on 23 October 1967 by the First President of Kenya, His Excellency Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. The County Council of the Central Rift comprised two administrative districts, namely Nakuru and Baringo Districts. The Council had under its administration the Area Councils of Naivasha, Nakuru, Molo, Londiani, North Baringo and South Baringo. This vast area covered seven thousand square miles with a population of about four hundred thousand people of different ethnic groups and diverse ways of life. This was under the regional (Majimbo) system of government. The Council of the Central Rift was disbanded in 1974 and the County Council of Nakuru as we know it today was formed. This comprised only the Naivasha and Nakuru areas. The boundaries were established at Mau Summit, Olenguruone, Kiptunga, Tipis, Lengatua, Ole-Kurto, Maiela, Milili, Suswa, Kijabe (bordering Kiambu), Keriton Hill (bordering Nyandarua), National Youth Service Karunga Hill (Gilgil), Gitare Centre, Kariandusi, Kasambara, Ngorika, Dundori Centre, Equator (next to Laikipia), Mbogoine, Lower Solai, Kisanana, Mogotio (Molo River boundary), Makutano, and Ndoinet. Economy Everywhere in Nakuru County is agricultural activity. Agriculture contributes 48% of income. Rural self-employment contributes 8%, wage employment 19%, urban self-employment 23% and other sectors 2%. The number of unemployed in 2002 was 294,195 (15%). Average farm size (small scale) is while average farm size (large scale) is . The main food crops produced include maize, beans, Irish potatoes and wheat. The types of fruits and vegetables grown are tomatoes, peas, carrots, onions, French beans, citrus, peaches, apples, cabbages, strawberries, asparagus and leeks. Most of these are grown in Bahati, Njoro, Molo, Rongai, Olenguruone, Nakuru Municipality, Gilgil and Mbogo-ini Divisions. There are three canning factories: Kokoto, Njoro Canners and Kabazi Canners. Tea production is carried out in Olenguruone, Keringet and Bahati Divisions. The parastatal company Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA ) only takes tea from Olenguruone and Keringet. The processing of small-holder tea together with that from Nyayo Tea Zone is carried out in Kiptagich Tea Factory Company Ltd. In Bahati Division are three large scale tea dams Beres, Ceres and Kinoru. The rest of tea farming is under small-holders in Kengero, Maombi and Munanda. Other cash crops include flowers, wheat, barley and pyrethrum. Most of all the barley needed for beer production is grown around Molo and Mau Narok. It is processed in Molo Town, where Kenya Malting Ltd has a factory and depots. This company also runs an extension scheme for its farmers under contract. Pyrethrum is a natural insecticide and the County is one of the most important production areas in the world. Most wheats are varieties of Mexican origin, due to climatic similarities between Mexico and Kenya. The total acreage under food crops is 130,000. The total acreage under cash crops 23,000. The main storage facilities include the National Cereals Produce Boards‚Äô stores and silos with a combined capacity of over 220,000 tonnes. Nakuru County has become one of the bread-baskets of the country. There is much economic activity in other sectors than agriculture. The County boasts 146 industrial plants and over 5,200 informal sector enterprises. Banks and financial institution include eight commercial banks with branches spread out across the County, as well as branches of seven nationwide micro-finance institutions. There are over 150 savings and credit co-operative organizations, popularly known as SACCOs, with a combined membership of 50,000 households. One of the fastest growing activities is horticulture, especially flower farming. Kenya has proven to be a very competitive exporter of cut flowers. New farms continue to be established, each one of them easily providing direct employment to 250 to 1,000 people. The most common livestock kept in the large-scale commercial farms are dairy and beef cattle, goat and sheep, with milk, meat, hide and skin, wool and mutton as their main products. The diversity and success of agriculture in the County is underscored by the presence of even horse- breeding, at Suswa Farm in Njoro Division. The majority of the large commercial farms are found around Naivasha, Molo, Rongai, Bahati and Njoro Divisions. The dairy industry is also well developed. An increasing number of farmer households is entering the dairy business, knowing that this can bring financial stability. Many small-holders are organized in cooperative societies. Large dairy processing plants are nearby in Nakuru Town and even export-grade cheese is being made by several firms in the area. Fishing is practiced in Lake Naivasha, a fresh-water lake of 145 km2. There are three landing beaches and over one hundred boats. Fishing is regulated to ensure sustainability. The population of fish farmers with fish ponds is around 100. These ponds are concentrated in Mbogoini, Bahati and Njoro Divisions. The main species of fish catch are Tilapia varieties, Oreochromis, salmoides and procambarus. The County Council of Nakuru is among the first rural administrative areas in Kenya to embark on an Information and Communication Technology strategy. The County was a champion in the \\"ICT in Local Government\\" campaign (2009). N/B There is a difference between Nakuru County and Nakuru County Council.

Joyful indeed shall we and our companions > in whose name we speak be, if we may be allowed to shed our blood in defence > of Pio Nono's work of redemption\\" (12 October 1847).  1848 revolution  By early 1848, all of Western Europe began to be convulsed in various revolutionary movements. The Pope, who claimed to be above national interests, refused to go to war with Austria, which totally reversed the up to now popular view of him in his native Italy. His situation was further complicated by strong opposition to him and his policies within the Vatican and the Papal States, originating in the forces, which he had defeated in the papal election two years earlier. Pius IX lived in exile at the Castle of Gaeta from 1848 to 1850 The Pope had appealed to the Austrian emperor to voluntarily cede the Italian provinces, which was rejected in Vienna, where the liberal policies of Pius IX were viewed with outright contempt.Schmidlin 32 Pius appointed a liberal Pellegrino Rossi as his chief minister for the Papal States, which resulted in additional negative emotions now also directed against Rossi. In a calculated, well-prepared move, Rossi was assassinated on November 15, 1848, and in the days following, the Swiss Guards were disarmed, making the Pope to a prisoner in his Quirinal.Schmidlin 35 In this public disorder, Pius IX was forced to concede a lay ministry with persons hostile to the Holy See, and a constitution. But public disorder grew, with repeated riots; Pius IX fled Rome and escaped in disguise as a regular priest to Gaeta on 24 November in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, leaving Rome to the radicals and the mob.  Roman Republic  On 15 November 1848 the Swiss Guards were disarmed, making the pope a prisoner in his Quirinal. From then on, Popes lived in the more secure Vatican. A Roman Republic was declared in February 1849. The Pope responded from his exile by excommunicating all active participants. The Republic was openly hostile to the Catholic Church, celebrating Good Friday with huge fireworks on Saint Peter's Plaza and desecrating Saint Peter's Basilica on Easter Sunday with a secular Republican victory celebration.Schmidlin 39 The public finances were spent liberally leading to an early financial disaster; palaces, convents and churches were plundered for valuables and art work. In addition to the official pillaging, private gangs roamed through the city and the countryside, murdering, raping and stealing and spreading fear among the citizens of the Papal States.  Papal policies in the Papal states The statue of Saint Peter was placed in the basilica by Pope Pius IX He visited the hospitals to comfort the wounded and sick but he seemed to have lost both some of his liberal tastes and his confidence in the Romans, who had turned against him in 1848. Pius decided to move his residence from the Quirinal inside Rome to the Vatican, where popes lived ever since.Schmidlin 45 He reformed the governmental structure of the Papal States on 10 September 1850 and its finances on October 28 in the same year. Later he cut his Papal States into twenty provincial units with 1219 communities.Schmidlin 44 These reforms were important but did not have the liberal flavour of his activities before the 1848 revolution. The Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli was now heading a cabinet with five ministers of which three were lay persons. Still, one of the accusations against this regime was its overly clerical nature, with most important positions reserved for the clergy, however some cardinals at that time were not even priests, first of all Giacomo Antonelli. Inside of Saint Peter's around 1870 End of the Papal States After defeating the papal army on 18 September 1860 at the battle of Castelfidardo, and on 30 September at Ancona, Victor Emmanuel took all the Papal territories except Latium with Rome. In 1870 after the French troops defending Rome were recalled because of the Franco-Prussian War, Victor Emmanuel seized the city in September, making it the capital of a new united Italy after its capture on September 20. The Black Nobility and most who held office in the Papal States lost their employment. Employees of papal institutes were dismissed. Pius IX, surrounded by loaded guns, declared the law of guarantees a hypocrisy and inequity and refused to accept Italian monthly stipends. I need money, it is true. My children throughout the world will meet my wantsShea 361Basilica Maria Maggiore around 1870 Roman Question The pontificate of Pius IX from his return to Rome in April 1850 to 20 September 1870 is described by Raffaele De Cesare as follows: Effects of the Law of Guarantees He granted Pius IX the Law of Guarantees (13 May 1871) which gave the Pope the use of the Vatican but denied him sovereignty over this territory, nevertheless granting him the right to send and receive ambassadors and 3.25 million liras a year. Pius IX officially rejected this offer,Encyclical Ubi nos, 15 May 1871 retaining his claim to all the conquered territory. Although he was not forbidden or prevented from travelling as he wished, he called himself a prisoner in the Vatican. See also September Convention. With the end of the Papal States in 1870, Pope Pius IX was thus the last Pope to hold temporal powers. The Law of Guarantees seemed, at least on paper, a reasonable solution after the take-over in Rome. However, to the Pope it was a public relations farce.Shea 358 Catholic convents, churches and hospitals were seized for barracks, government offices and stables. While the person of the sovereign Pontiff was solemnly declared sacred and inviolable, the residence of Pius IX was surrounded by armed soldiers, who would not permit the Pope to show himself in public. Article Two provided that anybody attacking the image of the Pope would be punished, but, as the Vatican pointed out, numerous groups and mobs denouncing the pope, and burning his effigy, were not punished in any way.Shea 359 Plans to leave Rome Several times during his pontificate, Pius IX considered leaving Rome. One occurrence was in 1862, when Giuseppe Garibaldi was in Sicily gathering volunteers for a campaign to take Rome under the slogan Roma o Morte (Rome or Death). On 26 July 1862, before Garibaldi and his volunteers were stopped at Aspromonte: Two other instances occurred after the Capture of Rome and the suspension of the First Vatican Council.

The style is only remotely related to Renaissance architecture. The term should not be confused with Mosan art, which applies to Romanesque art and architecture during the Middle Ages in the Meuse river region. The style has been applied predominantly in the Principality of Li√®ge in present-day Belgium and the Netherlands, mainly in the city of Li√®ge, the Land of Herve, and the regions of Belgian Limburg and Dutch South Limburg. The style is manifested in townhouses, castles, farms, manor houses, and sometimes in monasteries. The Mosan Renaissance style developed in Li√®ge in the 16th century during the reign of Erard de la Marck. The style is a take on earlier used methods of timber framing into which a new material (stone) has been incorporated. Stone- framed windows, decorated architraves and alternating layers of brick and stone are characteristic of the style. Most utilised materials were endemic to the regions where the style prevailed, namely blue limestone (also known as Namur stone), brick and mergel (a type of chalk).

The Ambrosian Circle in Italy, the Union of Catholic Workers in France and the Pius Verein and the Deutsche Katholische Gesellschaft in Germany all tried to bring the Catholic faith in its fullness to people outside of the Church.Schmidlin 313-315  Mariology  Pope Pius IX was deeply religious and shared a strong devotion to the Virgin Mary with many of his contemporaries, who made major contributions to Roman Catholic Mariology. Marian doctrines featured prominently in 19th century theology, especially the issue of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. During his pontificate petitions increased requesting the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception. In 1848 Pius appointed a theological commission to analyze the possibility for a Marian dogma.B√§umer 245  Thirty-eight Encyclicals  In a record 38 encyclicals he took positions on Church issues. They include: Qui pluribus (1846) on faith and religion; Praedecessores nostros (1847) on aid for Ireland; Ubi primum 1848 on the Immaculate Conception; Nostis et nobiscum 1849 on the Church in the Papal States; Neminem vestrum 1854 on the bloody Persecution of Armenians; Cum nuper 1858 with the care for Clerics; Amantissimus 1862 with the Care of the Churches; Meridionali Americae 1865 with the Seminary for the Native Clergy; Omnem sollicitudinem 1874 about the Greek-Ruthenian Rite; Quod nunquam 1875 the Church in Prussia. On 7 February 1862 he issued the papal constitution Ad universalis Ecclesiae, dealing with the conditions for admission to religious orders of men in which solemn vows are prescribed. Unlike popes in the 20th century, Pius IX did not use encyclicals to explain the faith in its details, but to show problem areas and errors in the Church and in various countries.Italy, Switzerland, Prussia and others His December 1864 encyclical Quanta cura contained the Syllabus of Errors, an appendix that listed and condemned as heresy 80 propositions, many on political topics, and firmly established his pontificate in opposition to secularism, rationalism, and modernism in all its forms. The document affirmed that the Church is a true and perfect society entirely free, endowed with proper and perpetual rights of her own, conferred upon her by her Divine Founder;Syllabus, 19Allocution \\"Singulari quadam,\\" 9 December 1854 The ecclesiastical power can exercise its authority without the permission and assent of the civil government.Syllabus, 20Allocution Meminit unusquisque, 30 September 1861. The Church has the power of defining dogmatically that the religion of the Catholic Church is the only true religion.Damnatio Multiplices inter, 10 June 1851. After centuries of being dominated by States and secular powers, the Pope thus defended the rights of the Church to free expression and opinion, even if particular views violated the perception and interests of secular forces, which in Italy at the time tried to dominate many Church activities, Bishop appointments and even the education of the clergy in seminaries. Council Fathers of Vatican One in 1870 The Syllabus nevertheless was controversial at the time. \\"The Pope whose influence and State was seen as declining even ending before the Syllabus, was at once the center of attention as the powerful enemy of progress, a man of boundless power and dangerous influence.\\"Gilmary, 279. Anti-Catholic forces viewed the papal document as an attack on progress, while Catholics were happy, that their rights were defined, and that the rights of monarchs were viewed in a restrictive way.Gilmary, 282. European Catholics welcomed the idea, that national churches are not subjected to State authority, as was so long practiced in France, Spain, Portugal under various versions of Gallicanism. American Catholics, who saw agreement of the papal views on the role of the State in Church affairs with those of the founding fathers, rejoiced over the definition of temporal rights in the areas of education, marriage and family. First Vatican Council The First Vatican Council presided by Pius IX Pius IX was the first pope to popularize encyclicals on a large scale to foster his views. He decisively acted on the century-old struggle between Dominicans and Franciscans regarding the Immaculate Conception of Mary, deciding in favour of the latter ones.Franzen, 340 However, this decision, which he formulated as an infallible dogma, raised the question, can a Pope in fact make such decisions without the bishops? This foreshadowed one topic of the Vatican Council which he later convened for 1869.Franzen 340 The Pope did consult the bishops beforehand with his encyclical Ubi Primum (see below), but insisted on having this issue clarified nevertheless. The Council was to deal with Papal Infallibility not on its own but as an integral part of its consideration of the definition of the Catholic Church and the role of the bishops in it. As it turned out, this was not possible because of the imminent attack by Italy against the Papal States, which forced a premature suspension of the First Vatican Council. Thus the major achievements of Pius IX are his Mariology and Vatican I. The Vatican Council did prepare several decrees, which, with small changes, were all signed by Pius IX. They refer to the Catholic faith, God the creator of all things, divine revelation, the relation between faith and human reasoning, the primacy of the papacy and the infallibility of the papacy. It was noted that the theological style of Pius was often negative, stating obvious errors rather than stating what is right.Schmidlin 318 Pius was noted for overstating his case at times, which was explained in part due to his epileptic condition. This created problems inside and outside the Church but also resulted in a clearing of the air and in much attention to his utterings, which otherwise may not have materialized.  Renewal and reforms  Council Fathers of Vatican One Contrary to stiff ultra-conservative sterility, which some attempted to associate with Pius IX, an extraordinary renewal of Catholic vigour and religious life took place during his pontificate: The entire episcopate was reappointed, and religious orders and congregations experienced a growth and vitality, which was not anticipated by anyone at the beginning of his papacy in 1846.Duffy 234 Existing orders had numerous applications and expanded, sending many of their ‚Äúexcess‚Äù vocation to missionary activities in Africa and Asia. Pius IX approved 74 new ones for women alone. In France, where the Church was devastated after the French Revolution, there were 160.000 Religious when Pius IX died in 1878, in addition to the regular priests, working in the parishes. Pius created over 200 news bishop seats, oversaw an unprecedented growth of the Church in the USA and created new hierarchies in several countries. Council Fathers of Vatican One Encouraged by Rome, Catholic lay people began to participate again in pilgrimages, spiritual retreats, baptisms and confessions and Catholic associations of all kinds.Schmidlin 309 The great number of vocations led Pius to issue several admonitions to Bishops, to weed out candidates with moral weaknesses.Schmidlin 307 He founded several seminaries in Rome, to ensure that only the best are admitted to the priestly service. Lazy priests or priests who did not perform were punished or dismissed from their service.Schmidlin 308. On the other hand, he also reformed the system of Church discipline, getting rid of some indulgences, causes for excommunication, suspensions of clergy and other disciplinary measures. He did not, however, undertake an overall reform of Canon Law. Catholic monasteries are officially not under the jurisdiction of the papacy, yet Pius IX on 21 June 1847, addressed them and asked for reforms. He wrote, that monasteries form an indispensable bridge between the secular and religious world and fulfill therefore an important function for the Church as a whole. He mandated a reform of monastic discipline and outlawed century old practices, by which men and women were given eternal vows and forced to stay in the convent or monastery without prior probation periods. He mandated a waiting period of three years for entry into a monastery, and declared all monastic vows without the three years as invalid.Schmidlin 310 Specifics included reform of the monastic habits, music and the theological preparation in the monasteries. most but not all of them accepted the reforms of the Pope. Pius did not hesitate to impose reform-minded superiors in several congregations. A special relation existed between him and the Jesuit order, which had educated him as a young boy. Jesuits were said to be influential during his pontificate, which created misgivings and animosity in the secular media at the time.

His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \\"king\\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his infallibility dogma, Ignaz von D√∂llinger, considered the \\"political regime\\" of the pope in the Papal States as \\"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\\".Schmidlin 45 Yet there was controversy. In the period before the 1848 revolution, Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned aboveSchmidlin 47  Governmental structure  The governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.Stehle 47 The Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: Internal Affairs including Police and Health; Commerce, including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; War, including the papal army; Clemency and Justice including police and the judiciary.  Finance  A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the Coloseum and Foro Romano around 1870 The financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in revenues stemming from the taxation of exports, imports and trade and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.Schmidlin 50 The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.Schmidlin 51 The criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for agriculture and forestry at the expense of potential industrial development. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of silk, olive oil and wine production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.  Commerce and trade  right Pius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve manufacturing and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of wool, silk and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and sea ports. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.Schmidlin 52 A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies. To increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and Prussia to reduce mutual tariffs, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventionsSchmidlin 53  Justice  The justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.Schmidlin 49 This problem, immortalized by Alessandro Manzoni's The Betrothed, and vividly described by the English Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.  Military  Papal soldiers around 1860 A unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman Black Nobility was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the Swiss Guard. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859. The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.  Education  Liberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the handicapped and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours. To improve the overall situation, he created a ministry of education in 1851.Schmidlin 63 An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873 The two papal universities in Rome and Bologna suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate. Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.1851 He increased the powers of the Camerlengo and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities. He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions, and added geology, agriculture science, archaeology, astronomy, and botany to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for pregnant women to give birth, several museums, and a papal astronomical observatory Theology students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of German, French, Polish, South American, North American, English, and Irish seminaries, where they could study together.  Social life  There was one newspaper Giornale di Roma and one periodical, Civilta Cattolica, run by Jesuits. When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of Eugenio Pacelli, approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, L‚ÄôOsservatore Romano, which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and Leo XIII bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.Schmidlin 54 After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal theocracy.  Arts  An 1870 view of the Lateran Pius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal censorship. He generously supported all expressions of art, architecture, painting, sculpture, music, goldsmiths, coppersmiths and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.Schmidlin 55 Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. Saint Peter's Basilica got numerous improvements, including the existing marble floors and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza. He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factory for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located Cancellaria to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.Schmidlin 59 Great efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the Colosseum which was threatening to collapse at the time.Schmidlin 61 Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discoveries of the Catacombs of San Callisto, which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings. Outside of Rome, Pius restored Etruscan and ancient Roman monuments in Perugia, Ostia, Benevento, Ancona and RavennaSchmidlin 62 An 1870 view of Saint Peter's  Protestants and Jews  The Papal States were a theocracy in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time. At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the Roman Republic issued sharp anti-Church measures,Pougeois II, p. 429. the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.Pougeois III, 258 In 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, Edgardo Mortara, was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been baptized by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to Hell if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \\"to extradite a soul\\".Pougeois IV, p. 200. Calls to return the child to his parents, from The Times, numerous heads of state including Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary and Emperor Napoleon III of France and Ambassador Gramont,Pougeois IV, p. 196. were politely rejected. Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification Rising tide of Italian nationalism Italian nationalism had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the Congress of Vienna (1814‚Äì15), which left Italy divided and largely under Habsburg Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a Roman Republic was declared and Pope Pius IX fled the city. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, recently elected president of the newly declared French Second Republic, saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which Giuseppe Garibaldi distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights. Papal troops suppressed the 1859 Perugia uprising. Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy In the years that followed, Italian nationalists ‚Äì both those who wished to unify the country under the Kingdom of Sardinia and its ruling House of Savoy and those who favored a republican solution ‚Äì saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as Emperor Napoleon III, tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia, playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other. Second Italian War of Independence Regiments of the Swiss Guard attacking rebels in 1859 After the Second Italian War of Independence, much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's expedition of the Thousand overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the Latium region surrounding Rome, raising the Roman Question. Rome declared capital of Italy Pope Pius IX, under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control Rome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital Turin in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because Napoleon III kept a French garrison in Rome protecting Pope Pius IX. By the September Convention of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the Battle of Mentana. The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the Franco-Prussian War began in July 1870. Emperor Napoleon III had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope, following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the battle of Sedan. Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy After the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans (see Giuseppe Garibaldi). widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King Victor Emmanuel II sent Count Ponza di San Martino to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. :The Pope‚Äôs reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King‚Äôs letter upon the table he exclaimed: \\"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \\"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day. Military resistance to Italy On September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General Raffaele Cadorna, crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the Aurelian Walls on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The city was captured on 20 September 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a plebiscite held in the following October. Capture of Rome This event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the Leonine City on the west bank of the Tiber, but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the Quirinal Palace, had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a self-proclaimed \\"prisoner\\", refusing to leave or to set foot in St. Peter's Square, and forbidding (Non Expedit) Catholics on pain of excommunication to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government. Prisoner of the Vatican In 1929, the papacy ‚Äì then under Pope Pius XI ‚Äì renounced its claim to the Papal States\\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\\" (Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.) and signed with Italy the Lateran Treaty, which created the independent State of Vatican City, \\"under the sovereignty of the Supreme Pontiff\\".Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty References * Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877 * Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K√∂stel-Pusztet M√ºnchen, 1922-1939 Category:Pope Pius IX Category:History of the Papal States Category:19th century in the Papal States ","title":"Papal States under Pope Pius IX"},{"id":"24919430","text":"Last Train Home () is a 2009 documentary film directed by Lixin Fan and produced by Daniel Cross and Mila Aung-Thwin of EyeSteelFilm. It won the Best Documentary Feature at 2009 IDFA and has been distributed by Zeitgeist Films in the US. Synopsis Every spring, China's 130 million migrant workers travel back to their home villages for the New Year's holiday. This exodus is the world's largest human migration. Working over several years, director Lixin Fan travelled with one couple who has embarked on these annual treks for almost two decades. Like many of China's rural poor, the Zhangs left their native village of Huilong, , Guang'an District in Sichuan province and their newborn daughter to find work in Guangzhou in a garment factory for 16 years and see her only once a year during the Spring Festival. Their daughter Qin, now a restless and rebellious teenager, resents her parents' absence and longs for her own freedom away from school and her rural hometown, much to the dismay of her parents. She eventually leaves school, against the wishes of her parents, to work in the city. Developments since the film In a March 2010 follow-up interview, director Lixin Fan reveals that the Zhangs are still working in the factory and Qin telephoned, but did not visit, for the New Year. In September 2011, Fan said that Qin was now a vocational student in Beijing, and that while Qin's mother is back on the farm, her father still works at the factory. In January 2012, an update on the family was released: > \\"We always kept contact with the family after we finished filming. The girl, > she quit that job at the bar and went to find a new job.

The church is a Grade I Listed building. Location The church occupies the east side of St. Michael's Square off Bugle Street in the heart of the Old Town, opposite the Tudor House Museum. In Medieval times, the Fish Market (now the Tudor Merchant's Hall adjoining the Westgate) was situated in St. Michael's Square. History Following the Norman Conquest of England, the town of Southampton was moved west from the original Saxon settlement of Hamwic, around the older St. Mary's Church, to higher ground closer to the River Test. Archaeological evidence has dated the foundation of the church at 1070 and the church was dedicated to St. Michael, patron saint of Normandy. The original church was built on a cruciform plan; the earliest parts of the present Church are the lower storeys of the central tower. The first documentary evidence of the existence of St. Michael's was in 1160 when Henry II granted the Chapels of St. Michael, Holyrood, St. Lawrence and All Saints to the monks of St. Denys, who retained the patronage until the Dissolution in 1537 when St. Michael's passed to the Crown. As the town prospered during the Middle Ages, becoming one of the most important ports in England, so did St. Michael's, being at the heart of the thriving medieval town. St. Michael's was enlarged with chapels being added to both sides of the Chancel in the 13th century. During the French raids on the town in October 1338, the church was badly damaged by fire, with the wooden buildings attached to it being completely destroyed. The French raids in the Hundred Years' War and the Black Death damaged the prosperity of the town, and it was not until the end of the 14th century that prosperity returned, with the resumption of the wine trade being evidenced by the large number of wine vaults under the old town streets. The west door was rebuilt in the 15th century In the late 14th Century the North Aisle of the church was widened, with the South Aisle being similarly widened and the West Door rebuilt in the 15th Century. Thus the church developed into its present almost rectangular shape. The Church's first spire was constructed in the 15th century and by the beginning of the 16th century a Chantry Chapel projected from the South Chapel. From the second half of the 16th century the importance of Southampton as a port declined, together with the prosperity of the town and the parish of St. Michael. As a result, the fabric of the Church was neglected to such a degree that the chantry chapel was shut off, to be let as a dwelling house and even as a barber's shop until it was pulled down in about 1880. It was not until 1836 that centuries of neglect were halted, with the newly installed vicar, Rev. T. L. Shapcott embarking upon a major reconstruction, involving new pews, raising the floor level, heightening of the aisles and extension westward of the north aisle, reconstruction of the roof to a lower pitch to bring the whole under one gable, insertion of new galleries to the designs of Francis Goodwin and the replacement of the medieval nave arcades by stuccoed brick and cast-iron pillars, making a slim, elegant contrast to the solid rough stonework of the earlier walls. The whole scheme cost the parish ¬£2,390. In 1872, the Goodwin galleries had to be removed as they were damaging the fabric of the building. The spire was first built in the 15th century, and reconstructed in 1732. In 1887, to make it a better landmark for shipping, a further 9 ft was added to the blunt shape, bringing it to its present graceful proportions. It is now high. In World War II, much of Southampton was devastated by enemy bombing during the blitz. Although the other churches in the central town, Holyrood and All Saints, were both destroyed in 1940, St. Michael's escaped with only minor damage, allegedly because the spire was used by the German bombers as a landmark and their pilots were ordered not to hit it. In the 1960s, the entire church was restored at a total cost of ¬£36,000, with the work being completed in time for the church's 900th anniversary in 1970. Description of the church Exterior The west wall has one of the original Norman pilaster buttresses, a 15th-century doorway and the marks of the original gabled roof line before the roof was raised in 1828. The south wall has pieces of the cluster of round pillars of the original Norman church, which were removed in 1828 and inserted in the wall when it was heightened. The large arch, which opened into the chantry, is now filled in. The east wall has 12th century work in its lower part with the external south-east angle of the 12th century chancel still projecting from the present wall. The north wall has a doorway with a well moulded, four-centred arched head and jambs of 15th century date (perhaps removed from the south transept wall when the door under the window was closed up and re-set here in 1828). The 165 ft high spire is surmounted by a weather vane comprising a gilded cock measuring 3 ft 3in from beak to tail, and 21in high. This was originally placed on top of the spire when this was rebuilt in 1733. Interior The walls average 3 ft 10in in thickness and are pierced towards the chancel, nave and transepts with semi-circular arches of a single square order. The arches are of equal span but are irregularly placed in their respective sides. Entrance on the western side The chancel is 22 ft 6in square. The lower part of the east wall is substantially 12th century. There is a triple arch piscina with double \\"bason\\" (c.1260) and a 15th-century single piscina. The north and south chapels, flanking the chancel, open to the chancel by fine arches of two chamfered orders. The south chapel, now used as a vestry, has a four-light east window similar to that in the north chapel. The 15 ft wide arch (now blocked up) leading to the chantry is in the south wall. The organ is raised above the choir vestry (in what was the south transept) which is separated from the south aisle of the nave by a screen, on which is mounted the only medieval woodwork remaining in the church. The north chapel was originally known as the Mayor's or Corporation Chapel because, until 1835, the Mayor was \\"sworn in\\" there. From 1677 onwards, the ceremony was performed without a sermon for in that year the Mayor and councillors took exception to being abused from the pulpit by the Vicar, Rev. Thomas Butler. The chapel's four-light east window has renewed 15th century tracery and glass of 1872. In the eastern jamb of the window in the north wall is a merchant's mark, a square sunk panel with a shield bearing a monogram ‚Äì the sign of the Woolstaplers' Guild. Opposite the north door, there is a 13th- century piscina. The south wall dates from the 15th century and has two square headed 15th century windows. The north wall has two-light late 14th century windows enclosed within acutely pointed heads. To the west of the second window is the blocked north doorway, adjoining the east jamb of which is a 15th-century holy water stoup. Windows External window on the northern side of the church The East Window depicts the five churches of medieval Southampton: St. John's (pulled down in 1708), St. Lawrence (pulled down between the wars), St. Michael's, Holyrood (bombed in 1940) and All Saints' (destroyed by bombing in 1940). The West Window depicts St Michael slaying the dragon. Furnishings Font The Tournai font in the southwest corner of the church The font was made in about 1170 from a single block of black Tournai marble and is one of four such fonts in Hampshire. Lecterns One of the two brass lecterns was rescued from the nearby Holyrood Church during the 1940 blitz and is one of the oldest (14th/early 15th century) and finest in the country, with a beautifully tapering eagle's body and separated wing feathers. The other is a fine brass eagle (c.1450), but of more familiar type; its claws and jewelled eyes are missing. Tombs and memorials The most famous tomb in the church is that of Sir Richard Lyster (c.1480‚Äì1554). Lyster was Chief Baron and later Lord Chief Justice of the Common pleas. His tomb was erected in 1567. The tomb is situated in the north-east corner of the church and is a delightful early-Elizabethan example of the use of fluted columns and other classical details. By the north-east corner of the tower is part of a 12th-century gravestone, with a carving of a Bishop in mass vestments, holding a crozier. High on the south wall is a memorial to Bennet Langton, with Samuel Johnson's epitaph to his close friend. Music for the Liturgy and the new organ OrganThe Choir of St Michael's is Cantores Michaelis - choral scholars from the University of Southampton who are funded by The Friends of St Michael‚Äôs. Cantores Michaelis sing every Sunday and Feast Days during the academic year. The group (founded in 2000 by the Director Keith Davis) specialises in unaccompanied repertoire composed for the Christian Liturgy.www.cantoresmichaelis.net. The original organ was built by H. C. Sims in 1880. It was enlarged by J. W. Walker in 1950, and subsequently rebuilt in 1986 by Keith Scudamore. In 1995 Andrew Cooper, of Griffiths and Cooper, undertook further renovations of the instrument. These included replacing the action, restoring the console and making a few tonal improvements. The pipe organ was replaced in December 2016 with a four manual replica of Hereford Cathedral‚Äôs famous Willis organ, digitally sampled by Hauptwerk built and installed by Romsey Organ Works. Bells From the 17th Century until 1878 there were six bells, which came from the Salisbury foundry. In 1878 two additional trebles were cast by John Warner & Sons. One of them was very thin and eventually needed to be repaired. In 1923 the peal was recast by Gillett & Johnston and hung in a new iron frame replacing the solid oak one.

Boxing In boxing, a septuple champion is a boxer who has won world titles in seven different weight classes. Manny Pacquiao is the first boxer to win world titles in seven different weight divisions. Pacquiao clinched the feat when he defeated Miguel Cotto via TKO in 12th round and won the WBO Welterweight (147 lbs) title on November 14, 2009 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Five of his world championships came from the \\"Big Four\\" (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO) sanctioning bodies and two were from The Ring, which hands out an official version of the lineal championship. He also won world championship belt from IBO in Light Welterweight division. The following are the world titles won by Pacquiao (arranged chronologically): WBC Flyweight (112 lbs), IBF Super Bantamweight (122 lbs), The Ring Featherweight (126 lbs), The Ring and WBC Super Featherweight (130 lbs), WBC Lightweight (135 lbs), The Ring and IBO Light Welterweight (140 lbs) and WBO Welterweight (147 lbs). If minor titles are also counted, the first man to win seven world titles was H√©ctor Camacho. His first three titles came from the World Boxing Council and the World Boxing Organization; his latter four titles came from the International Boxing Council and the National Boxing Association, a minor sanctioning body that was established in 1984 and not to be confused with the original National Boxing Association that was established in 1921 and changed its name to World Boxing Association in 1962.

It was opened for military traffic from Amesbury to the east-facing Newton Tony Junction (on the London and South Western Railway main line from Andover to Salisbury) on 1 October 1901. A west-facing junction, Amesbury Junction, where the branch burrowed under the main line, opened on 2 June 1902. The line closed in 1963. Previous proposals Although the line did not open until the early 1900s, various other proposals had been put forward, but none had succeeded in being built. Before the Bulford Camp branch opened, all nearby railway routes had skirted Salisbury Plain, but none led through it.Harding, Peter. The Bulford Branch Line. Binfield Printers, 1991, pp.4-5 Bristol and London & South Western Junction Railway This was a proposal by the London and South Western Railway which was designed, essentially, to poach traffic from the Great Western Railway. A Bill was deposited in Parliament in November 1882, for a line to branch away from the LSWR between Salisbury and Basingstoke at a point around two miles west of Grateley railway station. It would cross the plain via Amesbury and Shrewton to Westbury and then on to Bristol via either the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway or the North Somerset Railway. The Great Western Railway was bitterly opposed to this plan and succeeded in defeating it in 1883. Pewsey and Salisbury Railway Having defeated the scheme of the LSWR, the Great Western Railway then put forward a scheme of its own. This proposed a route from Pewsey railway station on their main line, leading south over the Plain and then onward to Southampton. However, Southampton was considered to be within LSWR territory, and the encroachment was opposed in much the same way as the B&L;&SWJR; had been. Although a section between Pewsey and Salisbury was authorised on 16 January 1883, this was never built. Light railways No more schemes were proposed until the passing of the Light Railways Act in 1896. The Great Western Railway swiftly saw the advantages of this approach and proposed a route which was very similar to their failed scheme of 1883. This light railway was to run up the Avon valley from Bemerton (near Salisbury) to Amesbury via Stratford, Woodford, Durnford and Wilsford. From Amesbury, the line was to continue to follow the Avon upstream to Pewsey via Durrington, Netheravon, Upavon and Manningford. The line was authorised on 6 August 1898. In the meantime, the War Office had been purchasing large areas of Salisbury Plain, and had already commenced negotiations with the LSWR for a light railway, very like the 1882 scheme. This would run from Grateley station and over the Plain, via Newton Tony and Amesbury, to a terminus just east of Shrewton, making the line 10 miles and 62 chains long. It was intended to serve both the new military camps and the agricultural community. This line was authorised as the Amesbury & Military Camp Light Railway. Of the two proposals, this scheme won out because the Great Western Railway's proposal involved crossing over four miles of land owned by the War Department, which was supporting the LSWR. Construction The LSWR awarded the contract for the railway to J. T. Firbank, who was already involved with other work in the area, principally the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway. He is also believed to have been the contractor who worked on the Charnwood Forest Railway. Although the line was officially a light railway, it was built to far more substantial standards, with heavy engineering works required. The way was laid with steel bullhead rails weighing 87lbs (heavier than some ordinary railways) and land had been obtained for double tracks, which was unusual for a light railway. In the event, the track was doubled. Opening The line opened to goods on 26 April 1902 and passenger traffic commenced on 2 June 1902. From the outset, the line was worked by the L&SWR.; When passenger services commenced, the first train to arrive at Amesbury brought the newspapers announcing the end of the South African War. Operation Traffic consisted of 6 passenger trains and 1 goods train per day. The line was extended to Bulford on 1 June 1906 and, at some stage, to Bulford Camp. World War I extensions Further extensions were constructed during World War I, consisting of lines from Amesbury to Larkhill Military Camp, and then westward to Rollestone Camp where there was a balloon school. A further extension was added southeast from Rollestone to Fargo, where there was a military hospital; this line then dividing with one branch going south to Druid's Lodge and one to Stonehenge. Aircraft hangars existed at both these locations. These extensions were operated by the R.O.D. (Railway Operating Division) of the Royal Engineers and they remained in use until about 1923. Closure The stations closed in 1952 along with Amesbury junction. The branch as a whole (including Newton Tony junction) ceased goods traffic in 1963. Part of its route became the Winterbourne Downs nature reserve, owned by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Although there has been significant development in the region since the closure, it is still possible to trace the original route that the railway took from aerial photographs. In many places, the railway trackbed now forms footpaths and bridlepaths, and elsewhere it is possible to identify the route in agricultural fields.

The Mathura train collision was a passenger train collision that occurred at 05:00 local time (01:30 UTC) in dark conditions near Mathura, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, on Wednesday, 20 October 2009. At least ten people were initially feared dead in the incident. It occurred when the Goa Express rammed into the stationary Mewar Express from behind at an outer signal, about 3 km from outer Mathura. Both the trains were headed for Delhi. Further details suggested that the death toll crossed 20. Derailment According to S S Khurana, the Chairman Railway Board, the Goa Express hit the other train from behind at 4.50am just 3 km from the outer signal of the Mathura junction station. Several coaches of both trains were reduced to mangled heaps of metal. The Indian Army had to be summoned with sophisticated gas cutters for rescue work. The Mewar Express had come to a halt after Munna Sajid, an undertrial who was being escorted by Rajasthan policemen, pulled the chain. Sajid, an alleged dacoit who was being brought for a hearing in Delhi, reportedly escaped by jumping from the moving train. The railway ministry claimed that prima facie the accident was caused by \\"human error\\" and blamed the Goa Express drivers for failing to spot the signal warnings on the line.

On leaving school he began an apprenticeship in Bern to study block-making and printing. He stayed there for four years which gave him the knowledge of colour which was invaluable in his later work and of course in his painting. Although he had always wanted to paint and had had ambition to go to Florence to study it was photography that initially captured his imagination and led him to London via short stints in Paris and New York. Photographers like Alfred Stieglitz, Avedon, Andr√© Kert√©sz, Weston, Edward Steichen and Henri Cartier-Bresson influenced his early work. Once in London, he started to do Reportage and Fashion photography working on assignments for magazines such as Stern, Vogue, Twen, Harper's Magazine and many others. It was then that he was spotted by the advertising industry and since then he has worked on over twelve hundred advertising campaigns, both national and international. Advertising discovered the potential of his images and this helped to make his name into one of the most prolific and successful in the industry - his artistic style has won him over a hundred awards. Each print is a unique work, emphasizing Heumann's absorption with the artistic side of photography. The final results have been fastidiously worked on, revealing a sensitive feel for the medium. But, as Heumann said during an interview in \\"Techniques of Masters\\" (worldwide satellite TV series, sponsored by Kodak): \\"A bad picture will always be a bad picture, no technique will save or improve it. It is not style or technique that makes the image. It is the thought and the interpretation of an experience in life, our seven senses, which have to be translated into a picture. The technique is only a tool for enhancement of a thought\\". Andreas Heumann has been described as ‚Äòone of the great natural photographers of our time and certainly one of the most influential‚Äô. He is already well known in the advertising industry through thousands of campaigns ranging from the sexy Aristoc images; the Nike campaign showing runners in the dark African bush and his many varied and dramatic shots for the automobile industry.

Publications  Augenblick (Ger. n.) - a moment of time; a blink. A blink ‚Äì a flash, a shutter closing on that instant which makes a work of art. This book shows another aspect of Heumann‚Äôs way of seeing, the subtlety of his still life which capture the moment but show that the moment is moving on; himself, the photographer, by essence a ‚Äòvoyeur‚Äô catching lights and shadows in moments many are not aware of; a single stem placed in a glass of water; the black cat leaping across one‚Äôs path; the hounds waiting for the call of the huntsman; a beautiful woman caught in the shower. Indeed, Blue Shower, exhibited at the Royal Academy, was much featured in the BBC‚Äôs recent coverage of this year‚Äôs Summer Exhibition. The work is so versatile, it makes you wonder what you have missed and what you might see, if you look for that ‚ÄúAugenblick‚Äù. - Some pictures make you aware about ironies in life without shouting too loud. In fact, they make you smile. This book is partly autobiographical; and the photographs are very much part of his own experiences, his creative thoughts and the continuing and penetrating interpretations of his own life. Whilst photography for Andreas is a never ending obsession he has always been interested in painting and took up this medium in 1999. Clearly influenced by Modigliani and Picasso, his expressive use of colour creates work that has been bought by collectors worldwide.

To replace it, the drainage mill Zuidplasmolen I was moved to Zoudwolde. It had stood between Moordrecht and Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel, Zuid Holland. The move was carried out by millwright C H Schiller of Dalfsen, Overijssel. In 1940, the sails were fitted with streamlined leading edges. This was the work of millwright Bisschop of Dalfsen. The mill stopped working after the Second World War, but a restoration was carried out in 1960, being completed in September. (Click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view.) In 1980-81 a further restoration of the mill was carried out. On 1 April 2001, there was a fire at the mill although prompt attendance by the fire brigade saved the mill. The sailstocks were removed on 5 May 2004. As of November 2009, there are no plans to return the mill to working order. Description De Wachter is what the Dutch describe as an \\"achtkante beltmolen\\". It is a three-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base. There is no stage, a mound of earth throw up against the base provides access for the sails. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch.

Maurassisme advocates absolute integral nationalism, monarchism, corporatism, alliance with revolutionary syndicalism, and opposition to democracy, liberalism, and capitalism.David Miller, Janet Coleman, William Connolly, Alan Ryan. The Blackwell encyclopaedia of political thought. Second Edition. Malden, Massachusetts, USA; Oxford, England, UK; Carlton, Victoria, Australia: Blackwell Publishing, 1991 Pp. 328. The doctrine of Maurrassisme A state of decadence Maurrassisme had as its ambition to be a counter- revolutionary doctrine, affirming the cohesion of France and its greatness. It began from a slogan \\"Politics first\\", from a postulate, patriotism, which the French Revolution had erased in preference to nationalism, and a state: for Maurras, the French society of the late 19th century was undermined by decadence and corruption. According to him, these ills arose from the Revolution and caused their paroxysm in the Dreyfus affair. Maurras' philosophical influences ranged from Plato and Aristotle to Joseph de Maistre, passing through Dante, Thomas Aquinas and Auguste Comte. His historical influences ranged from Sainte-Beuve to Fustel de Coulanges passing through Hippolyte Taine and Ernest Renan. At fault, for Maurras, was the revolutionary and romanic spirit, borne by the liberal forces which he called the four confederated states (√âtats conf√©d√©r√©s), defined by him in 1949 in Pour un jeune Fran√ßais: the Jews, the Protestants, the freemasons and foreigners whom Maurras called \\"metics\\" (m√©t√®ques).See further this extract from his Dictionnaire politique et critique. These represented the \\"anti-France\\"; they could not in any way be admitted as part of the French nation. Maurras' solution: order, reason and classicism Maurrassisme seems to have been born from a desire for order in the young Charles Maurras, attributed by some to his deafness.Laurent Dandrieu, Valeurs Actuelles, link to be provided *In philosophy, this desire for order incurred an unconditional attachment to reason. *In art, the defense of classicism against the \\"deviant\\" directions of romanticism. *In politics, he implied aiming for a regime based on authority. But for Maurras, a regionalist Proven√ßale poet, authority had to accord with the respect for regional liberties - a stipulation which, according to him, could only be found in monarchy. Maurras thus became a royalist on principle in 1896. More precisely with regard to politics, Maurrasisme rested on the following policies to ensure national cohesion: *The exclusion from the nation of the four \\"confederated states\\", and the exaltation of the national interest (\\"only France\\"), *Putting in place institutions charged with simultaneously guaranteeing the regional freedoms of the \\"real Nation\\" and maintaining national unity (for Maurras this institution was the Monarchy). *In morality, the magisterium of the Catholic Church as a unifying cement, and a creator and model of order. A political model based on the \\"Real Country\\" (pays r√©el) In the line of positivism, Maurras considered that societal organisation and institution ought to be the fruit of the selection imposed by the centuries, \\"organising empiricism\\" being considered more effective than idealized theories, because of its being adapted to each national situation. Monarchy played a part in these institutions, which were necessary notably to restrain Frankish-French rivalries. The confidence in institutions forged by time led Maurras to distinguish the \\"Real Country\\" (pays r√©el), rooted in the realities of life ‚Äî locality, work, trades, the parish and the family ‚Äî from the \\"Legal Country\\" (pays l√©gal) which he cast as artificially imposed on the \\"Real\\". These thoughts revisited organicist themes of Catholic political tradition. Maurras' institutional instinct also owed much to his initial federalism and his affiliation to the F√©librige movement of Mistral. He saw in monarchy the key to the vault of decentralisation. He considered that the people's direct attachment to the sovereign's authority and the moral cement of the Catholic Church were unifying forces which would be enough to ensure national unity in a largely centralized political system. The republic, by contrast, could only achieve these aims by being constrained by the iron belt of Napoleonic centralized administration. His vision was authority on high, with freedom beneath. It may be noted that it was through pragmatism and obsession with civil war that, in 1914 as in 1940, Maurras remained faithful to his principle of nationalist compromise, or the union nationale in time of crisis, and supported both Georges Clemenceau and Philippe P√©tain in this. Place in the history of political ideas A new political synthesis In terms of political institutions Maurras had been a legitimist in his youth, then a federalist republican, but rediscovered royalism (although as a supporter of the Orl√©anists) in 1896 through a political argument: kings had created France, and France had been degenerating since 1789. As a partisan of duc d'Orl√©ans and his descendants (the Duke of Guise, then the Count of Paris), he dreamed of converting the Action fran√ßaise, newly created by nationalist republicans, to the royalist ideal, and of gathering to him the remainder of traditional French royalty, exemplified by the Marquis of la Tour du Pin or General de Charette. The synthesis between counter-revolutionary ideas and nationalism (but also positivism), triggered by the moral shock of the war of 1870, which had turned some traditionalist forces towards the national idea and largely operated by the Dreyfus affair from 1898 onwards, was to find its apotheosis in Maurrassisme. While there remained some non- Maurrassiste political nationalist movements, such as the many Jacobin expressions of nationalism and the universalist nationalism along the lines of P√©guy, counter-revolutionary politics was completely converted to Maurrassisme by 1911 after the consolidation of traditional royalist groups. Maurrassisisme was to give a second wind to counter-revolutionary ideas, which had been in decline since 1893 which saw Catholics drawn to the Republic. It was to promulgate these ideas beyond their traditionally counter-revolutionary regions, Catholic society and the aristocracy. Personally an agnostic until the final years of his life (at which time he converted to Catholicism), Maurras appreciated the social and historical role of the Catholic religion in French society, particularly its role as a federating force. His utilitarian vision of the Catholic Church as an institution serving the interest of national cohesion fostered a convergence between devout Catholics and those more distanced from the Church. A major influence on the first half of the 20th century The Maurrassist synthesis would develop into a school of thought in France, and indeed extend beyond French borders. Within France, Maurrassisme became a major influence in intellectual and student circles (in law and medical departments, etc.) in the 1910s and 1920s, reaching a peak in 1926 before the pope's condemnation. By way of example, the Maurrassist current had its attraction to the most diverse personalities, \\"from Bernanos to Jacques Lacan, from T.S. Eliot to Georges Dum√©zil, from Jacques Maritain to Jacques Laurent, from Thierry Maulnier to Gustave Thibon, up to de Gaulle\\".Laurent Dandrieu, Valeurs actuelles, 15 September 2006 Maurrassisme was a particular source of inspiration for the R√©volution nationale of the Vichy regime of 1940-1941, the regime de Antonio Salazar in Portugal and of Francisco Franco in Spain. The links of Maurrassisme with the regimes of P√©tain, Franco and Salazar, the important role of antisemitism among Maurrassist activists, and the positions of certain Maurrassists at the time of the Second World War led to the discrediting of this current of thought, whose supporters had dwindled to a tiny minority in 1945. In France, its posterity can mainly be traced to the groups of officers opposed to the decolonization of Indochina and Algeria.

She is the lead character in Larsson's award-winning Millennium series, along with the journalist Mikael Blomkvist. Salander first appeared in the 2005 novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (original Swedish title, M√§n som hatar kvinnor, literally \\"Men who hate women\\" in English). She reappeared in its sequels: The Girl Who Played with Fire (2006), The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest (2007), The Girl in the Spider's Web (2015), The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye (2017) and The Girl Who Lived Twice (2019).  Creation  In the only interview he ever did about the series, Larsson stated that he based the character of Lisbeth Salander on what he imagined Pippi Longstocking might have been like as an adult. In the Millennium series, Salander has the name \\"V. Kulla\\" displayed on the door of her apartment on the top floor of Fiskargatan 9 in Stockholm. \\"V. Kulla\\" is an abbreviation of \\"Villa Villekulla\\", the name of Pippi Longstocking's house. Another source of inspiration was Larsson's niece, Therese. A rebellious teenager, she often wore black clothing and makeup, and told Larsson several times that she wanted to get a tattoo of a dragon. The author often emailed Therese while writing the novels to ask her about her life and how she would react in certain situations. She told him about her battle with anorexia and that she practiced kickboxing (previously jujitsu). After his death, many of Larsson's friends said the character was inspired by an incident in which Larsson, then a teenager, witnessed three of his friends gang-raping an acquaintance of his named Lisbeth, and he did nothing to stop it. Days later, wracked with guilt, he begged her forgiveness, which she refused to grant. The incident, he said, haunted him for years afterward, and in part moved him to create a character with her name who was also a rape survivor. The veracity of this story has since been questioned, after a colleague from Expo magazine reported to Rolling Stone that Larsson had told him he had heard the story secondhand and retold it as his own.  Character profile  Lisbeth Salander has red hair which she dyes raven black. Upon her first appearance in the series, she is described as \\"a pale, androgynous young woman who has hair as short as a fuse, and a pierced nose and eyebrows\\". She has a wasp tattoo, about two centimeters long, on her neck, a tattooed loop around the bicep of her left arm, another loop around her left ankle, a Chinese symbol on her hip, and a rose on her left calf. She has a large tattoo of a dragon on her back that runs from her shoulder, down her spine, and ends on her buttocks. This was changed in the English translation to a small dragon on her left shoulder blade. Salander visits a clinic in Genoa between the first and second books, where she had her wasp tattoo removed as she felt it was \\"too conspicuous and it made her too easy to remember and identify\\". She also has a breast enlargement, having previously \\"been flat-chested, as if she had never reached puberty. She thought [her breasts] had looked ridiculous, and she was always uncomfortable showing herself naked\\". Salander is a world-class computer hacker. Under the pseudonym \\"Wasp\\", she becomes a prominent figure in the international hacker community known as the Hacker Republic (similar to the group Anonymous). She uses her computer skills as a means to earn a living, doing investigative work for Milton Security. She has an eidetic memory and is skillful at concealing her identity; she possesses passports in different names, and disguises herself to travel undetected around Sweden and worldwide. Salander has a complicated relationship with investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, which veers back and forth between romance and hostility throughout the series. She also has an on-again/off-again romantic relationship with Miriam \\"Mimi\\" Wu.  Personality  The survivor of a traumatic childhood, Salander is highly introverted and asocial, and has difficulty connecting to people and making friends. She is particularly hostile to men who abuse women, and takes special pleasure in exposing and punishing them. This is representative of Larsson's personal views and a major theme throughout the entire series. In the series, Blomkvist speculates that Salander might have Asperger syndrome. Her mental state is never definitively described, an ambiguity that many antagonists in the series try to use against her: her sexually abusive public guardian, Nils Bjurman, describes her as \\"a sick, murderous, insane fucking person\\", while her one-time jailer Dr. Peter Teleborian describes her as \\"paranoid\\", \\"psychotic\\", \\"obsessive\\", and an \\"egomaniacal psychopath\\". On the other hand, Larsson stated that he thought that she might be looked upon as somewhat of an unusual kind of sociopath, due to her traumatic life experiences and inability to conform to social norms. In the book The Psychology of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, on the question \\"Is Salander a psychopath?\\", Melissa Burkley, Ph.D. and Dr. Stephanie Mullins-Sweatt write: \\"Although Salander is antagonistic and violent, she doesn't appear to lack a conscience, which is the hallmark trait of a psychopath. While she may not always follow society's rules, she does have her own set of moral principles that abide by a code of right and wrong.\\" At the end of the third book in the series Salander is declared sane and competent: Writers have described Salander as a \\"fiercely unconventional and darkly kooky antiheroine\\", a \\"superhero\\", a \\"misfit\\", and \\"an androgynous, asocial, bisexually active... loner who makes a living as a computer hacker...\\" Jennie Punter in Queen's Quarterly wrote that \\"the diminutive, flat-chested, chain-smoking, tattoo-adorned, anti-social, bisexual, genius computer hacker Lisbeth Salander\\" has become \\"one of the most compelling characters in recent popular fiction\\".  Storyline in books  Millennium series = The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo = In The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2005), Lisbeth Salander is introduced as a gifted, but deeply troubled, researcher and computer hacker working for Milton Security. Her boss, Dragan Armansky, commissions her to research disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist at the behest of a wealthy businessman, Henrik Vanger. When Blomkvist finds out that Salander hacked his computer, he hires her to assist him in investigating the disappearance of Vanger's grandniece, Harriet, 40 years earlier. Salander uses her research skills to uncover a series of murders, dating back decades and tied to Harriet's disappearance. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. The novel reveals Salander was declared legally incompetent as a child and is under the care of legal guardian Holgar Palmgren, one of the few people in the world she trusts and cares for. When Palmgren suffers a stroke, the court appoints her a new guardian: Nils Bjurman, a sadist who forces Salander to perform oral sex in return for access to her allowance. In a second sex session at his flat, he violently rapes and sodomizes her, unaware that she is recording his actions with a hidden camera. A few days later, she returns to his flat and, after disabling him with a taser, tapes his mouth and fastens him to his bed with his own bondage equipment, and finally sodomizes him with a huge anal plug. She then explains that she will release the video recording of him raping her if he does not do exactly what she orders, or if anything happens to her. She demands that he annul her legal incompetence and restore her sole access to her bank account. She tells him that she will visit him when she pleases, and if she ever finds him with a woman, even if she's there voluntarily, she will release the tape and destroy his life. Finally, she tattoos the words \\"I AM A SADISTIC PIG, A PERVERT, AND A RAPIST\\" on his abdomen, unlocks his handcuffs, and departs. Salander eventually uncovers evidence that Harriet's late father, Gottfried, and her brother, Martin, committed the murders. Salander then finds Blomkvist just in time to save him from Martin, who is in the midst of torturing him. She pursues Martin on her motorcycle, but he is killed when he deliberately veers into an oncoming truck. Salander later uses her hacking skills to discover that Harriet Vanger is alive and hiding in Australia, and to get sensitive information about Blomkvist's arch-rival, corrupt media magnate Hans-Erik Wennerstr√∂m. With the information uncovered by Salander, Blomkvist publishes an expos√© article and book that ruins Wennerstr√∂m and transform Blomkvist's magazine, Millennium, into one of the most respected and profitable in Sweden. During her investigation of Wennerstr√∂m, Salander uses her hacking skills and a series of disguises to withdraw billions of Swedish kronor from one of Wennerstr√∂m's off-shore accounts. Salander anonymously reveals the address of Wennerstr√∂m's final hideout to a lawyer with criminal connections, and Wennerstr√∂m is murdered three days later. At the end of the book, Salander acknowledges to herself that she has fallen in love with Blomkvist. On her way to tell him so, however, she sees him with his longtime lover, Millennium editor Erika Berger. Heartbroken, Salander abruptly cuts off all contact with him. = The Girl Who Played With Fire = The Girl Who Played With Fire (2006) begins with Salander's returning to Sweden after having traveled for a year. Shortly afterward, Salander is falsely implicated in the murder of three people: Bjurman and two of Blomkvist's colleagues. The frame-up is in fact a conspiracy between her biological father, former Soviet spy Alexander Zalachenko, and the Section, an illegal faction within S√§po, the Swedish Security Service, whose members had protected her father after he defected from the USSR. Zalachenko had been a high-ranking member of the GRU, and his defection was regarded by S√§po as an intelligence windfall, thus leading to the Section's covering up his subsequent illegal activities. Zalachenko had his son (and Salander's half-brother) Ronald Neidermann kill Blomkvist's colleagues, who were writing an expos√© article on Zalachenko and Neidermann's prostitution ring, and Bjurman, a former S√§po employee who would have been exposed in the article as Salander's rapist. The Section then falsely incriminates Salander to cover up their concealment of Zalachenko's crimes. Blomkvist tries to help Salander, even though she wants nothing to do with him. When she hacks into his computer, he leaves her his notes on the prostitution ring, from which she learns that Zalachenko is behind the frame- up. By the end of the novel, she tracks Zalachenko to his farm, where he shoots her in the head and has Neidermann bury her alive. She digs her way out, however, and hits her father in the face with an axe before losing consciousness. Blomkvist finds her and calls an ambulance, saving her life. The novel expands upon Salander's childhood. She is portrayed as having been an extremely bright but asocial child who would violently lash out at anyone who threatened or picked on her. This was in part the result of a troubled home life; Zalachenko repeatedly beat her mother but escaped punishment because the Section perceived his value to the Swedish State as being more important than her mother's civil rights. One day, when Salander was 12, Zalachenko beat her mother so badly that she sustained permanent brain damage. In retaliation, Salander hurled a homemade Molotov cocktail into her father's car, leaving him permanently disfigured and in chronic pain. The Section, fearing this would lead to their exposure, had the girl declared legally insane and sent to a Children's Psychiatric Hospital in Uppsala. While there, Salander was placed under the direct surveillance of psychiatrist Dr. Peter Teleborian, who had earlier conspired with the Section to have her declared insane. During her stay at the hospital, Teleborian put her in restraints for the most trivial infractions as a way of venting his repressed pedophilic urges. On the Section's orders, Teleborian declared Salander legally incompetent so that no one would ever believe her accounts of what they had done. They then had Bjurman, a lawyer in their employ, appointed as her guardian after Palmgren's stroke. = The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest = In the third Millennium novel, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest (2007), Salander is arrested for the three murders while she recuperates in the hospital. Zalachenko, who is a patient in the same hospital, is murdered by someone in the Section, who then tries to kill Salander; fortunately, Salander's lawyer (Annika Giannini, Blomkvist's sister) has barred the door. The would-be assassin then commits suicide. Due to her deep-seated mistrust of authority, Salander refuses at first to cooperate in any way with her defense, relying instead on her friends in Sweden's hacker community. They eventually help Blomkvist discover the full scope of the Section's conspiracy, which he strives to publish at the risk of his own life. Salander eventually writes, and passes to Giannini, an exact description of the sexual abuse she suffered at Bjurman's hands, but written in such a way as to make it sound hallucinatory so as to mislead the prosecution. At her trial, Salander is defiant and uncooperative. The prosecuting counsel uses testimony from Teleborian, appearing as their principal witness, to depict Salander as insane and in need of long-term care. Giannini then destroys Teleborian's credibility by introducing the recording of Salander's rape and produces extensive evidence of the Section's plot, published in Millennium that morning by Blomkvist. At the same time Giannini starts questioning Teleborian, the 10 members of the Section are arrested and charged with crimes against national security. Police briefly interrupt Salander's trial to arrest Teleborian for possession of child pornography, which Salander's fellow hackers uncovered from his laptop and sent to the authorities. Salander is set free the same day, her name cleared. After she is cleared of the charges, Salander receives word that, as Zalachenko's daughter, she is entitled to a small inheritance and one of his properties. She refuses the money but goes to a disused brick factory she has inherited. She is attacked by Niedermann, who has been hiding there since shortly after the confrontation with Salander at Zalachenko's farm. She nails his feet to the floor and then calls the same motorcycle gang who attacked her in the previous novel, who want him dead because he killed some of their people. Before they arrive to kill Niedermann, she contacts the police. That night, Blomkvist shows up at her door, and the two reconcile as friends. Continuation novels =The Girl in the Spider's Web= In The Girl in the Spider's Web (2015), written by David Lagercrantz as a continuation of the original series, Salander is hired by scientist Frans Balder to find out who hacked his network and stole his quantum computer technology. She hacks into the network of his company, Solifon, and discovers that his data was stolen by a criminal organization called the \\"Spider Society\\", with help from accomplices within Solifon and the National Security Agency. When Balder is murdered, Salander, with Blomkvist's help, saves Balder's autistic son August from the Spider Society's assassins, and she is badly wounded in the process. She bonds with August, a fellow math prodigy, and becomes his protector. Salander learns the Spider Society is led by her twin sister Camilla, a sociopath who as a child tormented her and delighted in the abuse their mother suffered at their father's hands. Camilla sends assassin Jan Holtster to kill Salander and August. Salander overpowers Holtster, however, and gives the police August's drawing of him. She has an opportunity to shoot Camilla during her escape, but cannot bring herself to kill her sister and allows her to get away. Salander returns August to his mother, Hanna, kicks Hanna's abusive boyfriend out of the house, and gives Hanna and August plane tickets to Munich so they can start over. She then supplies Blomkvist with information she hacked from the NSA, which he uses to write an expos√© article that results in the arrests of Camilla's accomplices and re-establishes Millennium as the most influential news magazine in Sweden. Salander shows up at Blomkvist's apartment, and they spend the night together. =The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye= In The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye (2017), written by David Lagercrantz as a continuation of the original series. =The Girl Who Lived Twice (2019)= Lagercrantz' third and final novel in the series, The Girl Who Lived Twice, was published in 2019.  Portrayals in films  Mara's portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in the 2011 American remake attracted critical acclaim from commentators. In 2009, the Swedish film and television studio Yellow Bird produced a trilogy of films based upon the first three novels. In these films, Salander is played as an adult by Noomi Rapace and as a child by Tehilla Blad. Rapace received a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role nomination in 2011. In the 2011 film adaptation of the first book, Salander is played by Rooney Mara, who received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress on January 24, 2012 for her performance. In the 2018 movie The Girl in the Spider's Web, Salander is portrayed by Claire Foy. Reception David Denby of The New Yorker stated that the character of Lisbeth Salander clearly accounts for a large part of the novels' success. Deirdre Donahue of USA Today referred to Salander as \\"one of the most startling, engaging and sometimes perplexing heroines in recent memory.\\" The New York Timess David Kamp called her \\"one of the most original characters in a thriller to come along in a while.\\" Likewise, Muriel Dobbin from The Washington Times dubbed her one of the most fascinating characters to emerge in crime fiction in years; \\"Her remoteness and her capacity for anger and violence are in contrast with a desperate vulnerability that she reveals only to the most unlikely of people.\\" Reviewing the first Swedish film, Roger Ebert noted that it is \\"a compelling thriller to begin with, but it adds the rare quality of having a heroine more fascinating than the story\\". The Independents Jonathan Gibbs called the character \\"a vision of female empowerment ‚Äì a kind of goth-geek Pippi Longstocking,\\" but also an \\"agglomeration of clich√©s.\\" Richard Schickel of Los Angeles Times suggested that Salander represents something new in the thriller genre; \\"She's a tiny bundle of post-modernist tropes, beginning with her computer skills.\\" Since 2015, there is a street named after Salander in Larsson's home town in north Sweden, Skellefte√•.

It takes the idea of the squid cult very seriously.

Additionally, a murder victim is found folded into a glass bottle. Various groups are interested in getting the squid back, including a naive staff member, a secret squad of the London Metropolitan Police, assorted religious cults, and various supernatural and mostly dead criminal elements.

The process is most prominently utilized by corporations and the call centre industry and has its highest effectiveness when call logging software tools are used. Calls are routed according to the set up of calling features within the given system such as Call queues, IVR menus, Hunt groups and Recorded announcements. Call features provide a customised experience for the caller and maximize the efficiency of inbound call handling. Call management parameters can specify how calls are distributed according to an operator's skill level in relation to a call, the time and/or date of a call, the location of the caller or through automatic routing processes. Calling features Call management features vary from system to system and are based on an organization's needs to enhance customer experience. The systems commonly retain information from received calls which is stored, and can be analysed and interpreted by a system administrator. A call detail record or call recording software is used to record all received calls, including time, date, duration, calling number and called number for future reference. Interactive voice response is a sound recording device that allows a caller to give information to a system verbally about what services or support they require. It uses speech recognition to direct callers on how to proceed while on the line. Another sound-based application is call whispering, which is a message played to an agent after answering a call that can give them information about the call in advance based on the Caller ID, number dialed or route taken through the system. Call management can also include directory programming for received calls. A hunt group is a directory containing one or many destination numbers. Upon receiving an incoming call, the directory is programmed to ring in a particular order, simultaneously or simply in the order in which they have most recently answered before being sent to a final destination if still unanswered. Alternatively, call queues can be used to keep a caller on hold until one of the destination numbers becomes available. Routing Call routing is the internal process of selecting a path for inbound telephone calls whether to individual agents or queues and often uses computer telephony integration system (CTI) to function within a network. Automated process include translation, which is the automatic routing of inbound calls from one telephone number to another, and auto attendants, which are large directories of extension numbers to provide a caller with access to their preferred destination. Lastly, fax to email is used for routing inbound fax calls to one or more email addresses, usually as attachments. Corporations and call centres have developed more specified criteria, which center around either the knowledge and/or skill level of an agent receiving the call, the location of the caller or the time and/or date of a call. Skills-based routing is programmed to route calls on to different destinations after identifying the most qualified and knowledgeable agent available to address a caller's needs. It is sometimes works in conjunction with omnichannel routing, where the priority of the call, the context of the customer journey and the agent's workload in real time are all taken into account. Older criteria-centered routing methods include location-based routing, which is programmed to route calls on to different destinations depending on the location of the caller, and time-based routing (also known as date-based routing), which is programmed to route calls to different destinations depending the time or date of the call.

The reserve protects the Blyde River Canyon, including sections of the Ohrigstad and Blyde Rivers and the geological formations around Bourke's Luck Potholes, where the Treur River tumbles into the Blyde below. Southwards of the canyon, the reserve follows the escarpment, to include the Devil's and God's Window, the latter a popular viewpoint to the lowveld at the reserve's southern extremity. The Mogologolo (1,794 m), Mariepskop (1,944 m) and Hebronberg (1,767 m) massifs are partially included in the reserve. Elevation varies from 560 m to 1,944 m above sea level. Its resort areas are F.H. Odendaal and Swadeni, the latter only accessible from Limpopo province. The area of approximately is administered by the Mpumalanga Parks Board. Bourke's Luck Potholes Potholes and plunge pools of the Treur River This geological feature and day visitors' attraction, named after Bernard Thomas Bourke (brother of Eddie Bourke), is situated at the confluence of the Treur and Blyde Rivers, on the reserve's western boundary . The reserve's nature conservation headquarters is located here, beside the village of Moremela, at the canyon's southern, or upper reaches. Sustained kolks in the Treur River's plunge pools have eroded a number of cylindrical potholes or giant's kettles, which can be viewed from the crags above. It was named after a local prospector, Tom Bourke, who predicted the presence of gold, though he found none himself. The pedestrian bridges connect the various overlooks of the potholes and the gorge downstream. The Three Rondavels The three rondavels The Three Rondavels are three round, grass-covered mountain tops with somewhat pointed peaks. They resemble the traditional round or oval rondavels or African homesteads quite closely, which are made with local materials. Sometimes they are also called the Three Sisters, though this may confuse them with a similar threesome visible from the N1 road in the Northern Cape, very far to the south. The names of the peaks commemorate a 19th century chief, Maripi, and three of his wives. The flat-topped peak adjacent to the rondavels is Mapjaneng, \\"the chief\\", who is remembered for opposing invading Swazis in a memorable battle. The three rondavels are named for three of his more troublesome wives ‚Äì Magabolle, Mogoladikwe and Maseroto. Behind the rondavels the distant high plateau of Mariepskop may be visible. Beside the dam, the isolated Thabaneng hill is known as the \\"sundial\\" or \\"mountain with a shadow that moves\\". It is said that the position of its shadow indicates the time of day. On a clear day the lookout point provides extensive views. From here one looks over the canyon to the Three Rondavels on the other side, which is flanked on various sides by promontories of the northern Drakensberg range. The formation of the attractive sedimentary formations are explained geologically as the slow erosion of underlying soft stone, leaving the exposed the more resistant quartzite and shale rondavels. God's Window A southward view from God's Window towards Kowyn Pass God‚Äôs Window is a popular vantage point along the Drakensberg escarpment, at the southern extremity of the Nature Reserve. Here, sheer cliffs plunge over 700 metres to the lowveld. From this escarpment--a mostly unbroken rampart of cliffs--opens a vista into the lowvelt expanse and escarpment forests, the Eden-like aesthetic appearance of which prompted the name. On a clear day it is possible to see over the Kruger National Park towards the Lebombo Mountains on the border with Mozambique. God‚Äôs Window features prominently in the plot of the 1980 cult film The Gods Must Be Crazy. Near the end of the movie, the Bushman character Xi (played by Namibian bush farmer N!xau) travels to God‚Äôs Window, and due to some low-lying cloud cover believes it to be the end of the Earth. The original Window is a rock that is set further back on a private farm and due to Quarry operations and tree plantation farming this actual rock that looks like a square window could not be used, therefore the site was moved by the government to the edge of the escarpment. A viewing platform near the car park gives extensive views down the gorge to the plain below. Fauna The high plateaus are inhabited by mountain reedbuck, baboon troops and rock hyraxes. Impala, kudu, blue wildebeest, waterbuck and zebra roam the wooded lowveld area. Hippo and crocodile are present in the Blyderivierpoort Dam. Three species of flat gecko were described in 2014 from the reserve and its vicinity. The Blyde River flat gecko, discovered in 1991, is as yet only known from the cliff face of one of the three rondavels, while the Mariepskop flat gecko was discovered on nearby Mariepskop in 1982. The Abel Erasmus flat gecko is known to occur at Bourke's Luck inside the reserve. Exotic fish like smallmouth bass, brown and rainbow trout occur in the river, which have reduced the range of the local Treur river barb to upper catchments of the Blyde River system. Thanks to reintroductions after its rediscovery in the 1970s, it now flourishes here. The Natal mountain catfish occurs as an isolated population in the Limpopo system, and the Belvedere creek is the only place in the Limpopo system where the Rosefin barb is found. African fish eagle and African finfoot are found along the Blyde River. The lowveld woodlands harbour purple-crested lourie, emerald cuckoo, red-backed mannikin, golden-tailed woodpecker, gorgeous bushshrike, white-faced owl and a number of raptors like white-backed vulture, gymnogene, black-chested snake eagle, Wahlberg's eagle and long-crested eagle. A number of raptors frequent the mountains and cliffs, including cape vulture, black eagle, jackal buzzard, peregrine falcon, lanner falcon and rock kestrel. Birds associated with flowering plants of the higher slopes include Gurney's sugarbird and malachite sunbird. A breeding colony of bald ibis occurs in the grassy uplands, besides small numbers of cape eagle-owl and red-breasted sparrowhawk. Forest birds include crowned eagle, Knysna lourie, cinnamon dove, olive bushshrike, green twinspot and wood owl. Flora Ten species of the Proteaceae occur within the reserve's confines, among which the Blyde river protea which is endemic to the canyon. The reserve's vegetation is classified as the Northeastern Drakensberg High-Mountain Sourveld ecoregion, an area prone to lightning-induced burning. Its very diverse flora is ascribed to the variation in altitude and rainfall (541 mm to 2,776 mm p.a.), and the extremes in geology and pedology. It is topographically complex with a variety of habitats which include grassland plateaus, wetlands and sponge areas, grassland slopes, afromontane forest, riparian forest, moist woodlands, dry woodlands and shrublands. Its four veld types are Afromontane Forest, North- eastern Mountain Sour Grassland, Sour Lowveld Bushveld and Mixed Lowveld Bushveld. Around a 1,000 plant species have been recorded. This includes cycads, of which the Blyde river cycad is almost endemic to the reserve, with some 200 individuals remaining. A variety of orchid, lily and protea (genera Protea, Faurea and Leucospermum) species occur, including the Blyde river protea which is endemic to the canyon, and the escarpment pincushion of which about 30 plants are present. Tree ferns grow along seepages in the uplands. Indigenous forest covers 2,111 ha of the nature reserve, or 7.3% of its surface area. These are fragmented into some 60 patches between 0.21 ha and 567 ha in extent. They are assigned to two forest communities, high altitude moist and low altitude dry afromontane forest. The altitudinal gradient accounts for most of their variation in plant communities. General area The reserve is fringed to the east by the Mariepskop and Klaserie Waterfall Nature Reserves, and the Mapulaneng forestry region, below the escarpment. National Park status had been considered, if some adjacent areas were to be incorporated and their forestry activities discontinued. Percy FitzPatrick and George Fullerton's summer quarters as transport riders during the 1880s was situated at Paradise Camp , some 6 km south of God's Window, and similarly perched on the edge of the escarpment. Close to God's Window are several waterfalls, including Berlin Falls and Lisbon Falls.

Life He was born at Dymock, Gloucestershire, and entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 13 January 1588, proceeding B.A. on 5 February 1591, M.A. on 12 December 1594, B.D. on 7 July 1603, and D.D. on 2 June 1632. He became a probationer fellow of his college on 20 March 1585, obtained the rectories of Northwold, near Thetford, Norfolk, and of Snailwell, Cambridgeshire, and a prebend in Hereford Cathedral on 20 January 1604. His learning, with a knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, attracted the attention of Sir Walter Raleigh, who received assistance from Burhill in the composition of his History of the World.Stephen Coote, A Play of Passion: The Life of Sir Walter Ralegh (1993), p. 342, who calls him Robert Burnhill and identifies him as Raleigh's chaplain. He died at Northwold in October 1641, and was buried in the chancel of the church there. A monument was erected to his memory by Samuel Knight, archdeacon of Berkshire, about 1740. Works He intervened in 1606 in a controversy between John Howson and Thomas Pye as to the marriage of divorced persons. In a Latin tractate (Oxford, 1606) Burhill supported Howson's contention that marriage in such cases was unlawful, and refuted Pye's opposite arguments. His pamphlet was bound up with a second edition of Howson's Thesis. In the controversy excited by Lancelot Andrewes's Tortura Torti, a reply to Cardinal Bellarmine, Burhill contributed Responsio pro Tortura Torti contra Martinum Becanum Jesuitam, London, 1611 (against Martin Becanus; De Potestate regia et Usurpatione papali pro Tortura Torti contra Parellum Andr. Eud√¶mon, Oxford, 1613 (against Andreas Eudaemon Joannes); and Assertio pro Jure regio contra Martini Becani Jesuit√¶ Controversiam Anglicanam, London, 1613, together with a defence of John Buckeridge's answer to Cardinal Bellarmine's apology. Burhill's printed works also include a Latin panegyric on James I, inviting him to visit Oxford (Oxford, 1603), and a preface to a sermon (London, 1602) of Miles Smith. Left in manuscript were: a commentary by Burhill on the difficult passages in the Book of Job; another manuscript tractate in support of monarchy and episcopacy; and a manuscript Latin poem in ten books, entitled Britannia Scholastica, vel de Britanni√¶ rebus scholasticis.

He was born as K√°roly Berger in Cservenka (Crvenka). He fought in the First World War where he was seriously injured. Then he joined the Hungarian Red Army to fight against the rebel nationalities. Between 1939‚Äì41, he was commandant of the Royal Military Academy. Ministers of the Arrow Cross Party government. K√°roly Beregfy is in the fourth from left of the lower row. He fought in the Second World War from 1941 as commander of the VI Corps, and later commanded the Third Army and the First Army. In April 1944 he suffered a serious defeat by the Red Army. The commission examining the reasons of the defeat established Beregfy's personal responsibility, so he was dismissed from his field command. He sympathized with the Arrow Cross Party from the beginning, although he could not join since under Hungarian Army regulations the members of political parties could not be officers in the Hungarian Army. After Operation Margarethe Arrow Cross leader Ferenc Sz√°lasi sought him out and asked him to assist in a coup if Mikl√≥s Horthy tried to negotiate a surrender. After the Arrow Cross Party's coup (15 and 16 October 1944) the new Prime Minister Sz√°lasi appointed Beregfy as Minister of Defence. He also served as Chief of Army Staff. Beregfy declared Hungary a manoeuvre area on 30 October and subordinated all attainable human and economical resources to the war. On 30 April 1945 he was captured by U.S. Army troops. Brought to trial before the People's Tribunal he denied his guilt throughout. The court did not accept his arguments (Beregfy referred to disability and compulsion) and sentenced him to death. He was hanged on 12 March 1946, along with Ferenc Sz√°lasi, G√°bor Vajna, former Interior Minister in the Arrow Cross Party's cabinet and J√≥zsef Gera, who was a Hungarist ideologist.

March 27, 1915) was a Scottish-born businessman and political figure in British Columbia, Canada. He represented Nanaimo from 1875 to 1876 and North Nanaimo from 1894 to 1900 in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. He was born in Dalzellyie, Kirkoswald, the son of John Brydan and Ann Cooper. Bryden received a certificate in mining and metallurgy and was hired by the Vancouver Coal Mining and Land Company operating near Nanaimo on Vancouver Island. In 1866, he married Elizabeth Hamilton, the daughter of Robert Dunsmuir who was a superintendent for the mine. In 1881, he went to work for a coal mining operation owned by his father-in-law. Bryden became a justice of the peace and served as a captain in the militia. He was president of the Albion Iron Works, treasurer for the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway and vice-president for the Union Colliery of British Columbia. The 1890 Coal Mines Regulation Act, provincial legislation, prevented persons of Chinese origin from working underground in coal mines. Bryden launched a legal challenge against the use of Chinese workers underground by the Union Colliery, with the intent of having the legality of the act reviewed: this resulted in the act being struck down since it was found that it interfered with federal powers. In 1875, he was elected to the Nanaimo City Council and then to the British Columbia assembly; he resigned from the assembly in 1876. Bryden was defeated when he ran for reelection in 1900. Bryden died in Esquimault at the age of 81.

The community shares boundaries with the communities of Wiston and Llawhaden and mainly consists of farmland and woodland. Much of the community is within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park and Picton Castle's stable block loft is an important breeding roost for the rare Greater Horseshoe Bat. History Slebech is situated on the upper Eastern Cleddau and was once part of the Barony of Daugleddau. In the Middle Ages Slebech belonged to the Knights Hospitallers of the Order of St John and the original church on the bank of the river was established in 1161, together with a commandery which became the headquarters of the order in West Wales. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII the lands passed to the Barlow family. Roger Barlow (c.1483-1553) was born in Essex, in or near Colchester, where his father was a customs official. After becoming a merchant in Seville, Barlow joined Sebastian Cabot's 1526 voyage to South America. He accompanied Cabot up the Rio de la Plata (River Plate) river system. He returned to England in 1530 and lived in Bristol, where he married Julyan Dawes. He moved to Pembrokeshire in 1535. In 1542 he presented a cosmography to Henry VIII, based on a translation of Enciso's Spanish Suma de Geographie. This included Barlow's descriptions of his travels - the first account of the New World in English. Roger Barlow had three younger brothers, William Barlow (successively bishop of St David's, Bath and Wells, and Chichester), John Barlow (dean of Worcester), and Thomas Barlow (a cleric in Norfolk). After renting the dissolved commandery of the hospitallers of St John of Jerusalem at Slebech, Roger and Thomas Barlow bought Slebech in 1546, and then Roger became the sole owner in 1553. Barlow had at least 10 children, including John who inherited Slebech.Heather Dalton, Merchants & Explorers: Roger Barlow, Sebastian Cabot & Networks of Atlantic Exchange 1500-1560 (Oxford University Press, 2016). Picton Castle Picton Castle The estates, gardens and parkland of Picton Castle was once part of the larger Manor of Wiston, but had become a separate holding, replacing Wiston Castle by the 13th century. Picton Castle began as a motte castle and was reconstructed in stone by the Wogan family during the 13th century. In 1405 French troops supporting Owain Glynd≈µr attacked and held the Castle, and it was seized again during the English Civil War in 1645 by Parliamentary forces. The Picton Castle estate was acquired by the Phillips family when Sir Thomas ap Philip of Cilsant married Jane, daughter and heiress of Sir Henry Dwnn, of Picton in the 1490s. Sir John Philipps, who inherited the castle in the 15th century, remodelled the building and created a new entrance which remained until the 1820s when a new entrance was designed by Thomas Rowlands (who also designed Slebech Church). The estate remained with the Phillips family until the death of Lord Milford, in 1823, when it was inherited by his cousin (through female lines) Richard Grant, who assumed the surname Philipps and was created a Baronet in 1828 and Baron Milford in 1847. His heir was his half-brother, the Reverend James Henry Alexander Philipps (formerly Gwyther), who assumed by royal licence the surname and arms of Philipps. On his death the estate passed to his son-in-law, Charles Edward Gregg Philipps, who was created a Baronet in 1887 (see Philipps Baronets), then to Sir Richard Foley Foley-Philipps, cousin of Sir John Erasmus, and grandson of Charles Edward Gregg Philipps. Now run by the Picton Castle Trust, the present owner, Jeremy Philipps, lives in a lodge in the grounds. Slebech Park Estate Slebech Hall Slebech Park developed from estates belonging to the Knights Hospitaller and their Commandery at Slebech Church. After the dissolution the Barlow family built Slebech Mansion near the site of the Commandery, and established Slebech Park. The Hall is a grade II* listed building and its stable block is grade II listed. After the death of George Barlow in 1757, having no son the land passed to his daughter Anne, who married William Trevanion of Cornwall and after his death, John Symmons of Llanstinan. Symmons sold the estate to William Knox of London, High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire for 1786, who in turn sold it to Nathaniel Phillips (High Sheriff for 1796). Nathaniel Phillips was born in England in 1733, the illegitimate son of a merchant trading between London and Kingston, Jamaica. Following his father he arrived at Kingston in April 1759 and used his father's connections to join a partnership with the Kingston merchants who owned sugar plantations which supported the slave trade to obtain workers. Over twenty five years he built a fortune and his Jamaican properties were valued ¬£160,000 Jamaica currency, as well as ownership of 706 slaves valued at ¬£50,000. In 1793, he bought the estate at Slebech from a bankrupt slaver. As well as Slebech Hall, which he had re-modelled by Anthony Keck,http://www.parksandgardens.ac.uk/component/option,com_parksandgardens/task,site/id,2997/Itemid,/ Phillips bought of park land and woodland. In 1796 he married Mary, a Philipps forty years younger than him and had two sons (Nathaniel and Edward Augustus) and two daughters (Mary Dorothea and Louisa Catharine). After his death, Phillips' heirs continued to operate the Jamaican estates but they became unprofitable after the end of slavery in 1834. Slebech Hall and Eastern Cleddau After the death of Edward, the estate passed to Mary Dorothea and her sister, Louisa Catherine, the Countess of Lichfield, as co-heiress. In 1821 Mary Dorothea met Charles Frederick Baron de Rutzen of Germany in Rome. A Polish nobleman and descendant of Field Marshal Potemkin, they married in 1822 and became Lords of the Manors of Slebech. Their eldest son, Baron Frederick Leopold Sapieha Manteuffel (High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire for 1871), died and the estate passed to his younger brother, Baron Rudolph William Henry Ehrard (High Sheriff for 1895), who was succeeded by his nephew, Alan Frederick James. Their third son, Albert Richard Francis Maximilien married Horatia Augusta Stepney Gulston, of Carmarthenshire and their eldest son, Alan Frederick James married Eleanor Etna Audley Thursby Pelham, in 1908.Phillips- Evans, J. The Longcrofts: 500 Years of a British Family, 2012 (Amazon) Their only son, John Frederick Foley de Rutzen married Sheila Victoria Katrin Philipps, of Picton Castle, and their only child, Victoria Anne Elizabeth Gwynne de Rutzen, married Sir Francis Dashwood of West Wycombe Park. Their descendants managed both estates and in 2003 previous owners Geoffrey and Georgina Philipps created a ¬£4m business and leisure development converted the 18th Century stables at Slebech Park to house 15 bedrooms, function suite and 40 cover restaurant. It was the first project in Pembrokeshire to attract European Objective One funding and was also funded by the Welsh Development Agency (WDA) and the Wales Tourist Board. The Phillips family left the Estate in 2014, since then the new owners have added a further 5 bedrooms and have re branded as Slebech Park Estate, a 5 star country retreat with nationally recognised award-winning accommodation and restaurant. Lieutenant-Colonel Augustus Henry Archibald Anson VC MP, (5 March 1835 - 17 November 1877), recipient of the Victoria Cross during the Crimean War, was born at Slebech Hall.Augustus Anson Geology On the northern bank of the Eastern Cleddau, the foreshore is of mud, marsh and rocks. Slebech has extensive deciduous woodland and open farmland. Fields are large and regular and are divided by earth banks topped with hedges. Agriculture land use is improved pasture with a small proportion of arable crops. The Rhos village The only settlement of any size is the small hamlet of The Rhos with a population of 25 people. Community services and facilities are limited, with a small church hall. The Rhos village is located along one street which once included a primary school and post office. The old school building is now a private residence. Originally known as 'Slebech and Picton Castle School', it later became Slebech Voluntary Controlled School and operated from 1866 with support from the Philipps family of Picton Castle. It was taken over by the Education Authority in the 1930s and closed in 1985, with only 11 pupils on the register. Listed buildings Grade II listed Slebech Park is one of a total of 25 listed buildings in Slebech with the main ones as follows: St Johns Church Slebech The Church of St John the Baptist is a Grade II listed building which was consecrated in 1848 as Slebech Parish Church in place of the older Parish Church. It was designed by Thomas Rowlands of Haverfordwest and paid for by Baron de Rutzen with contributions from Queen Adelaide. The church was deconsecrated in 1990 due to subsidence. Greater Horseshoe Bat The Stable Block at Slebech Park is Grade II listed. A rectangular block 40m by 60m built of local rubble stone masonry with quoins of limestone. An unusual feature is that crenellated parapets hide slate roofs. The stables have an octagonal clock-tower with a weathervane. The stable block loft is also an important breeding roost for the rare Greater Horseshoe Bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and numbers have been recorded at Slebech since 1983. Blackpool Bridge is Grade II listed and located to the east of Blackpool Mill to cross the River Cleddau. A single-span bridge, it was built about 1825 for the de Rutzens family of coursed, undressed stone, with two carved external panels on either side and dressed stone edge on the rim of the arch. To the south of the bridge are stone piers topped by ball finials. Scheduled Ancient Monuments Remains of the old church of St John the Baptist (PEM 275). Located between the mansion of Slebech and the river, this is a ruin with only the main walls surviving. Records show that in 1766 the ceiling fell down and workmen were paid for the job of \`stripping the church.' The owner, Baron de Rutzen, built a replacement church and stripped the rest of the roof in 1844, partly to stop worshipers coming on to his land. Burial mounds on the island to the east of the church (PEM 276) are also scheduled ancient monuments, one is known locally as Dog Island because it is where Slebech Park owners have buried their pets over the past hundred years.

Existence  Every finite- dimensional matrix has a rank decomposition: Let A be an m\\\\times n matrix whose column rank is r. Therefore, there are r linearly independent columns in A; equivalently, the dimension of the column space of A is r. Let c_1,c_2,\\\\ldots,c_r be any basis for the column space of A and place them as column vectors to form the m\\\\times r matrix C = [c_1:c_2:\\\\ldots:c_r]. Therefore, every column vector of A is a linear combination of the columns of C. To be precise, if A = [a_1:a_2:\\\\ldots:a_n] is an m\\\\times n matrix with a_j as the j-th column, then :a_j = f_{1j}c_1 + f_{2j}c_2 + \\\\cdots + f_{rj}c_r, where f_{ij}'s are the scalar coefficients of a_j in terms of the basis c_1,c_2,\\\\ldots,c_r. This implies that A = CF, where f_{ij} is the (i,j)-th element of F.  Non-uniqueness  If A = C_1 F_1 is rank factorization, taking C_2 = C_1 R and F_2 = R^{-1} F_1 gives another rank factorization for any invertible matrix R of compatible dimensions. Conversely, if A = F_{1}G_{1} = F_{2}G_{2} are two rank factorizations of A, then there exists an invertible matrix R such that F_1 = F_2 R and G_1 = R^{-1} G_{2}.  Construction   Rank factorization from reduced row echelon forms  In practice, we can construct one specific rank factorization as follows: we can compute B, the reduced row echelon form of A. Then C is obtained by removing from A all non-pivot columns, and F by eliminating all zero rows of B. = Example = Consider the matrix : A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 1 & 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 7 & 3 & 9 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 5 & 3 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 0 & 8 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\sim \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} = B\\\\text{.} B is in reduced echelon form. Then C is obtained by removing the third column of A, the only one which is not a pivot column, and F by getting rid of the last row of zeroes, so : C = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 7 & 9 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 5 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 8 \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\text{,}\\\\qquad F = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\text{.} It is straightforward to check that : A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 1 & 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 7 & 3 & 9 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 5 & 3 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 0 & 8 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 7 & 9 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 5 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 8 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = CF\\\\text{.} = Proof = Let P be an n\\\\times n permutation matrix such that AP = (C, D) in block partitioned form, where the columns of C are the r pivot columns of A. Every column of D is a linear combination of the columns of C, so there is a matrix G such that D = CG, where the columns of G contain the coefficients of each of those linear combinations. So AP = (C, CG) = C(I_r, G), I_r being the r\\\\times r identity matrix. We will show now that (I_r, G) = FP. Transforming A into its reduced row echelon form B amounts to left-multiplying by a matrix E which is a product of elementary matrices, so EAP = BP = EC(I_r, G), where EC = \\\\begin{pmatrix} I_r \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. We then can write BP = \\\\begin{pmatrix} I_r & G \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}, which allows us to identify (I_r, G) = FP, i.e. the nonzero r rows of the reduced echelon form, with the same permutation on the columns as we did for A. We thus have AP = CFP, and since P is invertible this implies A = CF, and the proof is complete.  Singular value decomposition  One can also construct a full rank factorization of A by using its singular value decomposition : A = U \\\\Sigma V^* = \\\\begin{bmatrix} U_1 & U_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\Sigma_r & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_1^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ V_2^* \\\\end{bmatrix} = U_1 \\\\left(\\\\Sigma_r V_1^*\\\\right) . Since U_1 is a full column rank matrix and \\\\Sigma_r V_1^* is a full row rank matrix, we can take C = U_1 and F = \\\\Sigma_r V_1^*.  Consequences   rank(A) = rank(AT)  An immediate consequence of rank factorization is that the rank of A is equal to the rank of its transpose A^\\\\textsf{T}. Since the columns of A are the rows of A^\\\\textsf{T}, the column rank of A equals its row rank. Proof: To see why this is true, let us first define rank to mean column rank. Since A = CF, it follows that A^\\\\textsf{T} = F^\\\\textsf{T}C^\\\\textsf{T}. From the definition of matrix multiplication, this means that each column of A^\\\\textsf{T} is a linear combination of the columns of F^\\\\textsf{T}. Therefore, the column space of A^\\\\textsf{T} is contained within the column space of F^\\\\textsf{T} and, hence, rank\\\\left(A^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right) ‚â§ rank\\\\left(F^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right). Now, F^\\\\textsf{T} is n \\\\times r, so there are r columns in F^\\\\textsf{T} and, hence, rank\\\\left(A^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right) ‚â§ r = rank\\\\left(A\\\\right). This proves that rank\\\\left(A^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right) ‚â§ rank\\\\left(A\\\\right). Now apply the result to A^\\\\textsf{T} to obtain the reverse inequality: since \\\\left(A^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right)^\\\\textsf{T} = A, we can write rank\\\\left(A\\\\right) = rank\\\\left(\\\\left(A^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right)^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right) ‚â§ rank\\\\left(A^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right). This proves rank\\\\left(A\\\\right) ‚â§ rank\\\\left(A^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right). We have, therefore, proved rank\\\\left(A^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right) ‚â§ rank\\\\left(A\\\\right) and rank\\\\left(A\\\\right) ‚â§ rank\\\\left(A^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right), so rank\\\\left(A\\\\right) = rank\\\\left(A^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right). (Also see the first proof of column rank = row rank under rank).

Two were entered, though engine problems prevented one from taking part; the other was eliminated with a broken undercarriage. A third aircraft was amateur-built in Canada and flew until 1934. Design and development The Cranwell Light Aeroplane (CLA) club was formed in 1923 by staff and students at the RAF College Cranwell. The students came from No.4 Apprentices Wing and one of their lecturers, Flt-Lt Nicholas Comper became chief designer of the three aircraft produced by the club as well as one, the CLA.1 that was not completed. The last of the series, the CLA.4 was designed to compete in the 1926 Lympne Light Aeroplane Trials. Two were built for this competition, one to be powered by a Bristol Cherub engine and the other by the new Pobjoy P. Unfortunately, the latter engine failed its own trials not long before the Lympne event and only the Cherub powered aircraft took part. Since the CL.4 had been designed for the 65 hp (48 kW) Pobjoy, the 36 hp (27 kW) Cherub left it seriously underpowered. Many sesquiplanes have flown, the great majority of types having a smaller lower wing than upper. The CLA.4, unusually, was an inverted sesquiplane with a smaller upper wing, joining a small group of aircraft like the Fiat CR.1 of 1924 and the later Caproni Ca.100, Caproni Ca.164 and Levasseur PL.15, all military machines. There is a small aerodynamic penalty for this arrangement, but the advantages for a club machine are good vision, and ease of escape, from both cockpits.Flight 2 September 1926 p.548 In the case of the CLA.4, the upper wing had a span of 80% of the lower and 83% of its chord. The wings were straight, unswept and of constant chord apart from at the rounded tips, with ailerons on the lower wings only. The CLA.4 was a single bay biplane with inward leaning single wide chord interplane struts with wide, faired roots. Two pairs of centre section struts held the upper wing well clear of the fuselage; the absence of stagger made wing-folding easy. Like much of the rest of the aircraft, the wings were of fabric covered wood. The fuselage was built up on four longerons, spruce at the rear where they were linked into a tapering Warren girder, and ash ahead of the rear cockpit where more traditional wire braced rectangular forms were used. It was topped with a standard rounded decking. The two open cockpits were placed at the leading and trailing upper wing edges and fitted with dual controls. The flat twin Bristol Cherub III was mounted on a steel plate and smoothly partially cowled to a neatly pointed nose, but with the cylinder heads exposed for cooling. At the rear of the fuselage the fin and tailplane were fabric covered metal structures, though the generous control surfaces were wood framed. Fin and rudder together formed a shape not unlike that of many de Havilland aircraft though more rounded and unbalanced. The main undercarriage was built from a pair of steel V-shaped tubes bearing a single axle and rubber cord shock absorbers. The first CLA.4 Operational history Two CLA.4s were built for the Lympne trials, the Cherub powered G-EBPB, entry no.12 and the Pobjoy powered G-EBPC. no.11.Flight 9 September 1926 p.577 The latter was withdrawn because of the Pobjoy problems and was one of three withdrawals before the start on 10 September, leaving 13 competitors.Flight 18 September 1926 p.528 On the following day no.12, flown by Nick Comper suffered an undercarriage failure and was refused permission to replace it, forcing retirement. Comper went on to fly the aircraft at the Bournemouth meeting in 1927 and in the King's Cup of the same year, then at Blackpool and Orly meetings in 1928 without great success. Its Cherub, normally a reliable engine (the top four aircraft at Lympne 1926 had used it) seems to have been a poor sample. The aircraft was sold into private ownership and flew until scrapped in 1933. The second Cranwell built CLA.4, G-EBPC was also fitted with a Cherub but was destroyed in a crash in March 1927. At least one other CLA.4 was built, but not at Cranwell. Plans were sold to the Alberta Aero Club (now the Edmonton Flying Club) of Edmonton, Canada, which intended to build it as the Club's first aircraft. This project was not completed and the plans, incomplete airframe, two engines and parts were sold to Alf Want of Edmonton, who had done the most work on the project. He built it at his home, fitting a Blackburne Thrush. Dates are uncertain, but it seems to have flown from 1931 or 1932 until a crash due to icing near what is now the City Centre Airport in February 1934, making it the last CLA.4 to fly. During this period it was re- engined with a more powerful 55 hp Viele M-5 engine to improve its performance, perhaps to cope with the higher operating altitude of Edmonton. In 1989 Want presented the remains to the Alberta Aviation Museum, Edmonton, where it is being restored to flying condition. In 2001 it was displayed in a half-covered state so its structure could be seen and appreciatedAlberta Museum CLA.4 but by 2008 was fully covered aft of the engine firewall. Its original Blackburne Thrush is displayed beside it and the other Thrush is now in the Reynolds-Alberta Museum collection. The aircraft has never been registered with the Canadian authorities. Naming At least some contemporary sources like Flight refer to both the Cranwell built aircraft by the number 4 (or sometimes IV), with no letter suffix. The Civil Aviation Authority first registration documentsCAA refisttartion documents for G-EBPBCAA refisttartion documents for G-EBPC refer to the Cherub powered G-EBPB as a CLA.4A and the other machine as a CLA.4, and later authors use this engine based distinction. They generally agree that G-EBPB is a CLA.4A; but some imply G-EBPB became a CLA.4A when fitted with the Cherub with which it always flew, whereas others continue to use the original CLA.4 name.

As a player, Dudgeon was a left-back; he began his career with Manchester United, and represented Carlisle United, Hull City and Barnsley in the Football League before retiring due to injury in 2015.https://uk.linkedin.com/in/joe-dudgeon-217a49bb Born in Leeds, England, he represented the Northern Ireland national under-21 team on four occasions between 2009 and 2011. Club career Manchester United Dudgeon played his first match for the Manchester United Under-18s side in April 2006, when he was still only 15 years old, coming on as a substitute for Oliver Norwood in a 3‚Äì2 defeat away to Sunderland. He then appeared in two matches at the 2006 Northern Ireland Milk Cup in August 2006 ‚Äì a 1‚Äì0 win over County Tyrone and a 2‚Äì2 draw with Sheffield United ‚Äì but didn't play for the club again until February 2007, when he appeared in eight of the club's last 10 Premier Academy League fixtures. His performances earned him a trainee contract with the club, which he signed in July 2007. The following season, Dudgeon became a regular in the Under-18 team, appearing 21 times as they managed a third-place finish in the Premier Academy League and the Fourth Round of the FA Youth Cup. He also received his first taste of reserve team football during 2007‚Äì08, being named as an unused substitute for the reserves' 4‚Äì0 win over Oldham Athletic in the quarter-finals of the Lancashire Senior Cup. He retained his spot in the under-18 side for 2008‚Äì09, while continuing to establish himself in the reserves, mainly as a substitute, making his debut on 22 January 2009 in a 3‚Äì0 win over Accrington Stanley in the first round of the Lancashire Senior Cup, coming on as a half-time substitute for F√°bio. At the end of the season, Dudgeon was named in the reserve squads for the finals of both the Manchester Senior Cup and the Lancashire Senior Cup; as an unused substitute in the former and playing the full 90 minutes in the latter. In 2009‚Äì10, Dudgeon made the full step-up to the reserve team, and after playing in the first six Premier Reserve League games of the season, he was rewarded for his performances with a first team squad number (44) ahead of the League Cup Fourth Round tie against Barnsley. However, he was not included in the matchday squad. He remained a regular in the reserve team throughout the season, appearing in 14 out of the team's 18 Premier Reserve League matches as they claimed the Premier Reserve League North title. He then appeared in the Premier Reserve League play-off against Aston Villa, which United won 3‚Äì2 on penalties after coming from behind three times to draw 3‚Äì3 in normal time. After appearing regularly for the reserve team during the 2010‚Äì11 pre-season, Dudgeon underwent knee surgery at the end of August 2010 and missed three months of the start of the season. He returned in mid-November 2010 to reclaim his regular left-back berth, appearing in the next five Premier Reserve League matches. On 27 January 2011, Dudgeon signed for Carlisle United on loan until the end of the season to provide defensive cover after Sean McDaid suffered a season-ending injury in October 2010. He was the fourth Manchester United player to go on loan to Carlisle in 2010‚Äì11. Dudgeon made his debut for Carlisle on 29 January, coming on as a half-time substitute for Peter Murphy in a 2‚Äì2 at home to Oldham Athletic. He then made his first league start three days later in Carlisle's 2‚Äì0 defeat away to Huddersfield Town. Hull City On 11 May 2011, Hull City signed Dudgeon on a three-year contract. He made his debut in the first game of the season on 5 August 2011 at the KC Stadium in the 1‚Äì0 defeat to Blackpool. For the remainder of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Dudgeon was in and out of the starting line-up, with regular competition for the left back slot with Andy Dawson. Under new Hull manager Steve Bruce, Dudgeon started the 2012‚Äì13 season in fine form, and was ever-present in the side until a serious knee injury in October ruled him out for the rest of the season. On 7 July 2014, Dudgeon signed a new one-year contract with the club. On 28 May 2015, Hull City did not renew Dudgeon's contract along with five other players who were out of contract at the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season. Loan to Barnsley On 31 July 2014, Dudgeon joined League One side Barnsley on a one-month loan. International career Although he was born in England, Dudgeon is of Northern Irish descent and was called up to the Northern Ireland national under-21 team in October 2009. He appeared in the team that lost 2‚Äì1 away to Iceland U21 on 13 October, and then played again against Germany U21 in a 1‚Äì1 home draw. On 5 October 2012 it was announced that he had received his first call up for the Northern Ireland senior team for their game against Portugal on 16 October 2012.

Tuke played club rugby for Bective Rangers and played international rugby for Ireland. Tuke played in nine internationals, most notably in all three matches of Ireland's first Triple Crown winning Championship in 1894. Rugby career Tuke first came to note as a rugby player when he joined Bective Rangers, the club team with which he would spend his entire international career. Tuke played his first international game in the final Ireland match of the 1890 Home Nations Championship, brought in at half back alongside Robert Gibson Warren as a replacement for Alaster McDonnell. Warren and Tuke played competently at half, but despite a strong display were unable to muster the team to victory. The defeat left Ireland bottom of the Championship. Despite the loss, the Irish selectors kept faith with Tuke and he was reselected for the 1891 Championship. Ireland had a terrible season, which was not helped by inconsistency at the half back position. With Warren having retired at the end of the previous season, Tuke was partnered with McDonnell for the opening loss against England, and then with Edwin Cameron in the next game a home defeat to Scotland. In the final game, Tuke was replaced, but the end result was yet another defeat. The 1892 Home Nations Championship saw Tuke regain his place in the opening Irish match, again against England. The game ended with another Irish loss, and Tuke was dropped, not just from the 1892 Championship, but also the following year's tournament. In 1894, Tuke was back in the Ireland squad, with the club now adopting the Welsh four three-quarter tactic for the first time. There was far more consistency in the Ireland team during the tournament, with only three player changes throughout the entire campaign. Tuke was partnered at half back with Walter Stewart Brown, and they both kept their places throughout all three games of the Championship. The first game was against England, Tuke's fourth encounter with the same side, but this time the Irish were victorious. Tuke had a solid game and set up the winning try, when he fed Lucius Gwynn who fell short of the English line, but through the bodies Lytle emerged with the ball to score. The second match, played at home against Scotland, saw a narrow Irish win from a single converted try; this left the final game of the tournament, a home encounter with Wales, as the Championship decider. The game was played at the Ballynafeigh ground, which resembled a morass, leading the Welsh officials to lodge a complaint to the International Rugby Board. The game still went ahead and Ireland won by a single penalty goal, giving Ireland their very first Triple Crown Championship. Tuke played in just one more championship, in 1895. After the success of the previous season, Ireland slumped to their pre-1894 form, losing all three matches. Tuke played in the first two games of the season, but was dropped for the game against Wales and never played for his country again. In 1896, Tuke moved to Coventry, joining Coventry R.F.C., and also turned out for the Midlands County team.Gloucestershire (All matches and trials listed) www.cliftonrfchistory.co.uk Notes References * * Category:1870 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Irish rugby union players Category:Ireland international rugby union players Category:Bective Rangers players ","title":"Benjamin Tuke"},{"id":"24920225","text":"Tom√°s Teresen (born August 14, 1987) is a male professional road cyclist from Venezuela.

They form a roughly triangular shape with a west facing side, a north facing side, and a south-east facing side. It is 17 kilometres from east to west across this triangle and some 16 kilometres north to south. The highest point is White Coomb at 821 m (2694 ft). The town of Moffat lies just south of the Moffat hills and along with Tweedsmuir, at the northern extremity, is the only centre of population around these hills. In some older maps, the northern part of the Moffat Hills is called the Tweedsmuir Hills, but can also be known by the title Manor Hills. Looking SSW over Loch Skeen to Mid Craig (on the far side of the loch) and White Coomb beyond, from ascent of Lochcraig Head in winter conditions - the three arms of the letter \\"E\\" described below in routes from Loch Skeen. Roads, hills and water systems to the west The west facing side of the Moffat hills is bounded by the River Annan and River Tweed - the source of both these rivers (which are little more than 1 kilometre apart at source) lie on this boundary. The Annan runs south into the Solway Firth but the Tweed heads north and then east to run through the border countryScottish Border Heritage to the North Sea at Berwick-Upon-Tweed. Westward beyond the valley of the River Annan (Annandale) lies the main west coast corridor running northwards into central Scotland, carrying the west coast railway line and the M74 motorway. Scree run above Hartfell Spa. The next range of hills to the west is the Lowther hills wherein lies the source of the River ClydeSource of the river Clyde. The A701 road from Moffat to Edinburgh rises rapidly from Moffat and is soon high above Annandale. At Annanhead where the source of the River Annan is, the A701 reaches the height of 395 metres and looks down into the Devil's Beef Tub. This is the watershed between the Annan and Tweed systems and it lies in the administrative region called Dumfries and Galloway. The source of the Tweed is in the Borders Region. The regional boundary runs erratically eastward from Annanhead, then goes north around Loch Skeen (or Skene) before heading south east to Birkhill Cottage in Moffatdale where the pioneering geologist Charles Lapworth stayed from 1872 to 1877.Charles Lapworth Roads, hills and water systems to the north The north facing side of the Moffat Hills is bounded by a minor road (no road number on the Ordnance Survey map) which runs from Tweedsmuir village to St Mary's Loch, passing along the banks of the Talla Reservoir and the Megget Reservoir and rising to 450 metres by the Megget Stone.Ancient Stones A Guide to Standing Stones & Stone Circles in the South of Scotland The hills to the north here are called the Manor or Tweedsmuir hillsAncient Stones A Guide to Standing Stones & Stone Circles in the South of Scotland and the hills to the north west of the Moffat hills are called the Culters (pronounced Cooters).

The minor road which runs from Tweedsmuir to St Mary's Loch past Talla and Megget reservoirs can be seen coming down to meet the A708 by the loch side in the middle of the picture. This is at Cappercleuch. The two lochs are separated by the narrow strip of land that can be seen in the middle distance and Tibbie Shiels Inn is on that strip of land. The southern Upland Way passes along the south side (far away side in this picture) of St Mary's Loch The south-east facing side of the Moffat Hills runs down the shore of St Mary's Loch and Loch of the Lowes - not to be confused with Loch of the Lowes in Perthshire.

There is a project in progress to restore a wild woodland environment, as it would have been six thousand years ago, to the treeless Carrifran Glen.Carrifran Wildwood The Borders Forest Trust The hill range to the south east of Moffatdale is called the Ettrick Hills and the Ettrick Water has its source in the middle of these hills before it runs north eastward to join the Yarrow Water at PhiliphaughUK Battlefields Resource Centre (where the Yarrow loses its name to the Ettrick). The head waters of the Yarrow are just east of Birkhill and the water from there runs through both Loch of the Lowes and St Mary's Loch. Once the Yarrow and the Ettrick Waters join they in turn lose their identity when they meet the River Tweed between Selkirk and Galashiels. Annandale Way The Annandale WayOfficial Annandale Way Website is a new 55 mile (85 km) long distance walking route which follows the valley of the river Annan from its source to the sea. The route was launched on 12 September 2009 and can be walked either north to south or south to north. It has been developed by Sulwath Connections and local communities with the support of local estates and farmers to help promote Annandale as a new area for walking. From the northern end It starts high above the source of the river Annan with a circumnavigation of the Devils Beef Tub before dropping down its eastern side and following the river Annan along the valley bottom into the picturesque market town of Moffat. From there it follows the valley of the river Annan through the historic town of Annan to the southern end of the walk where the river runs into the Solway Firth. There is a choice of alternative routes for two sections of the walk. The Way has been designed to be achievable in 4 to 5 days as a continuous walk but it also offers several fine day walks. Freedom of access Covenanter Monument to John Hunter above the Devil's Beef Tub --- Inscription on the monument reads \\"On the hillside opposite John Hunter Covenanter was shot by Douglas's Dragoons 1685 his grave is in Tweedsmuir Kirkyard\\" Freedom of Access,Scottish Outdoor Access Code - Access Legislation the right to roam where you choose, was written into Scottish law by the new Scottish Parliament in 2002. Prior to that it had been an unwritten right by custom. In the Southern Uplands of Scotland there are plenty of wild places in which to exercise this right, of which The Moffat Hills range is amongst the best. Points of access With this freedom of access it is theoretically possible to enter these hills anywhere one chooses; but in practice, in most cases, a car has to be parked somewhere and this immediately cuts down the options since the roads on all three sides are not at all suitable for random parking for any length of time. Besides this there are a number of particularly useful points of entry to the hills depending on what area of the hills is to be visited. We will consider these points of access based on the three-sided triangle described above and so we have access from; Moffatdale in the south east, Annandale in the west and the Megget stone in the north. These are the most scenically interesting and challenging entry points and the ones that most walkers would choose. Coming in from the direction of the River Tweed the landscape is nothing like so dramatic. Access from Moffatdale The routes from Moffatdale into the hills would generally be recognised to be the most spectacular because of the variety of scenery and general quality (and variety) of walking interest they offer. There are three main points of entry from Moffatdale; Capplegill, Carrifran and Grey Mare's Tail. According to legend, Bodesbeck Farm, near to Moffat Water, was once been the home of a brownie. From Capplegill Moffat hills from Hartfell  1 White Coomb -- 2 Carrifran Gans -- 3 Saddle Yoke -- 4 Ettrick Pen (Ettrick hills) -- 5 Glen of the Blackhope Burn -- 6 Hartfell From the top of Saddle Yoke looking WNW across the face of Under Saddle Yoke and over Blackhope Glen to Falcon Craig (in the middle of the picture) with Hartfell near the right edge. The Blackhope Burn joins Moffat Water close to a farm called Capplegill (OS. Ref. NT147098) on the A708. Just to the north east of Capplegill (roughly 150 metres) there is room for a car or two to park by Blackshope house. The classic walk from here is to head north from where you are parked passing through a field where there are usually Belted Galloways to be seen, and up onto Saddle Yoke which as the name implies has two tops with a short saddle between them. These tops are Saddle Yoke (just over 630 metres high ) and Under Saddle Yoke (745 metres. From there descend to the water course in Whirly Gill before climbing to the top of Saddle Craigs at the head of the Blackhope Glen and just below Hartfell Rig (739 metres). An alternative to this is to go up onto the rig itself but that would be to miss the views from the top of the crags that are Saddle Craigs. Now climb to the summit of Hart Fell and then follow the ridge from there back to Capplegill going over Swatte Fell en route. In other words, this route goes up one side of the hills above Blackhope Glen and back down the other. The crags on this return leg are quite spectacular (particularly around Hound Shoulder) with views over the glen to Under Saddle Yoke then Carrifran Gans and White Coomb (the highest hill in the Moffat Hills) beyond. Capplegill is also a useful access point to the Ettrick Hills which lie south of Moffatdale. From Carrifran Moffat hills from Bodesbeck Ridge  1 Black Craig -- 2 Swatte Fell -- 3 Hartfell -- 4 Saddle Yoke -- 5 Raven Craig -- 6 Firthhope Rig -- 7 Carrifran Gans -- 8 White Coomb -- 9 Carrifran Glen -- 10 Moffatdale There is parking associated with Carrifran Wildwood project at OS Ref NT163117 which can be used for this route. It is a steep climb from there to the top of Carrifran Gans (nearly 670 metres in 2 kilometres). From there it is possible to either take in White Coomb and Firthhope Rig in the next stage or, descend to the more interesting waterfalls around Firthhope Burn - White Coomb can be saved for the Grey Mare's Tail routes. Around the waterfalls offers the best views and also some quite interesting terrain to scramble over - not only around the waterfalls themselves but also while crossing the face of the steep lower slopes of Firthhope Rig on the way up to Games Castle (a natural feature resembling a castle) and Rotten Bottom (the sump area for all the peat hags round about). Now the route heads along the top of the crags of Raven Craig and Priest Craig (i.e. around the top of Carrifran Glen) and towards Saddle Yoke from where it makes its way down to where the car is parked. Here again the route goes up one side of a glen (Carrifran Glen) and back the other, along the tops above the glen. From Grey Mare's Tail Parking at the Grey Mare's Tail is in the National Trust for Scotland car park and there is a path constructed by them up the side of the hill from there towards Loch Skeen to follow. There are plenty of warnings around this path of the fatalities which have occurred to those who have left the path to get a better view of the waterfall and slid down the steep sides of the hill. Because of the spectacular scenery, the walk up to Loch Skeen is very popular indeed with the casual visiting tourist, but really, proper hill walking footwear is necessary for this path. This is very often not the case for those who go there on impulse and not equipped for the terrain. There is a visitor centre by the car park where it is possible to \\"watch live\\" wild birds nesting - as viewed from a remote camera on the hillside. thumbright410pxGrey Mare's Tail in the Moffat Hills from the Bodesbeck Ridge in the Ettrick hills. Detail from above photograph of Grey Mare's Tail, showing Loch Skeen with outflow into the Tail Burn which feeds the Grey Mare's Tail Moffat Hills. From Loch Skeen there are a range of options open to the walker. * To go round Loch Skeen over Lochcraig Head, which involves a 280-metre climb from the loch level - and continue along the tops to White Coomb and then back down to where the Tail Burn runs out of the loch and thence back to the car park. * Between Lochcraig Head and White Coomb there is a small but characterful ridge that can be taken up or down over Mid Craig with access from the point where the Tail Burn exits from the Loch. Using this it is possible to go either left to White Coomb or right to Lochcraig Head from the top of the ridge. Mid Craig ridge is therefore like the shorter middle horizontal stroke in a letter \\"E\\" with White Coomb and Lochcraig Head being the longer ridges at either end of the \\"E\\" and Firthybrig Head ridge being its back. This layout of these ridges allows for a choice of routes in itself. * It is possible to head directly from White Coomb back down to the car park - though the final descent into Moffatdale on this route is steep and not advised in slippy conditions whether wet or icy. However you can get some interesting views of the Grey Mare's Tail at the top of that descent. Any combination of these routes is of course possible. The hills around Loch Skeen\\"Loch Skene\\" by J.E. Gordon - Extracted from the Geological Conservation Review offer classic geological features of international interest. Loch Skeen has also been used successfullyArticle from the Daily Telegraph on the success of the vendace experiment in Loch Skeen to try to preserve the endangered species of fish called the vendaceThe vendace page in Images of Life on Earth which has a history in Britain going back to glacial times. There were vendace in the Lochmaben Lochs until as recently as 1963. As these lochs silted up and the vendace were threatened an unsuccessful attempt was made by Dr Peter Maitland of Stirling University to transfer some to Loch Trool in the Galloway hills before they became extinct.Copy of a letter to Scotland in Trust summer 2008 on vendace in the Lochmaben Lochs It is the heavily glaciatedScottish Geology shapely landscape in these hills which offers such visual interest to the walker. The surface of Loch Skeen is 510 metres above sea level and as such is probably the highest loch of any great size in the South of Scotland. Access from Annandale From Annanhead From Hartfell looking west to the great bowl among the hills that is the Devil's Beef Tub (in sunlight) with Annanhead to the right of the picture above the Beef Tub. The M74 and main west coast rail line corridor lies in the valley beyond that and the Lowther hills are in the distance. The lush green valley of the river Annan (Annandale) is in the left foreground and the A701 climbs up from left to right above this valley from Moffat town to Annanhead, Tweedsmuir and, eventually, Edinburgh. The classic route here is to park at Annanhead above the Devil's Beef Tub (room for several vehicles there) and walk up over Annanhead Hill, Great Hill and Chalk Rig Edge to Whitehope Heights, a route which goes round the top of the Beef Tub. From Whitehope Heights most walkers would choose to go on to the top of Hartfell. Mostly the return route would be to just return by the route taken outwards, but it is possible to go down over Arthur's Seat to the River Annan at Ericstane, climb out of the other side of the valley and onto the A701 and hence back to Annanhead. The area in the valley around Ericstane is rich in ancient remains (settlements and burnt mounds) and before you get back to where the car is parked you will pass a monumentInformation on John Hunter of Tweedsmuir from Southern Reporter newspaper above the Beef Tub to John Hunter of Tweedsmuir, a covenanter who was shot in 1685 while trying to escape from dragoons by climbing the side of the Beef Tub. From Moffat Well Entrance to Hartfell Spa Sign at Hartfell Spa Park at Moffat Well some 2 kilometres north of the town of Moffat (after finding your way through the back streets of Moffat to get there) and then head up over Greygill Head and Blue Cairn to Swatte Fell. From there most walkers would probably want to go to Hartfell. On the return leg head back to Birnock Cloves just to the south of Swatte Fell summit and from there down Birnock Water back to Moffat Well. The sulphurous waters of Moffat Well were believed to have healing properties and during the Victorian era the high demand for this led to the water being piped down from the well to a specially built bath house in the town centre (now the Town Hall). From the Community Hall Upper Annandale To get to the community hall (OS. Ref. NT075103) proceed northwards on the A701 heading out of Moffat town centre till you arrive at a mini roundabout by the school. This is just before you reach the 30 miles per hour sign at the edge of town. Leave the A701 at this point forking right onto the minor road which goes through to Corehead and gives access to the Devil's Beef Tub itself. The community hall is on your right some four and a half kilometres along this road near a sign for \\"Hartfell Spa\\" (where there is a Chalybeate spring). The Borders Forest Trust took over ownership of Corehead in July 2009. They aim to return lost wildlife and habitats to Corehead and to conserve the unique character of the Devil‚Äôs Beef Tub. The hills and valleys were once cloaked with the native woodland which made up the Ettrick Forest. From the community hall follow the track towards the spa. After about one and a half kilometres the track enters the valley of the Auchencat Burn at a metal gate. From there descend from the path to the burn and choose one of the rough planks over the burn to cross it. From the burn climb to Swatte Fell, go on to Hartfell and come down over Arthur's Seat making for the gully above the spa. The descent down this gully to the spa is on steep slate-like scree and is quite interesting as is the spa itself. From there just follow the spa path back to the community hall. Megget Stone at the highest point on the minor road between Talla reservoir and Megget reservoir Access from the Megget Stane The Megget Stane (OS. Ref. NT152203) is by a cattle grid at the highest point between the Talla and Megget reservoirs on the minor road which runs from Tweedsmuir on the A701 to Cappercleuch by shore of St Mary's Loch. It is quite easy to miss the stone when coming from Talla as it is hidden by a gate. At an elevation of over 430 metres, parking here offers a high starting point whether into the Manor hills to the north or the Moffat hills to the south. No specific folklore or other traditions have been found associated with this stone but it is likely that, being at the watershed as it is, the spot would have been used as a meeting place or tryst, as are similar places throughout the Scottish Borders. There are two ridges running in a southerly direction from here which can be taken into the Lochcraig Head area above Loch Skeen and it is quite possible to go out on one ridge and back on the other in a relatively undemanding day's walk. This walk can be lengthened slightly by taking in Dead For Cauld which offers fine views over the Megget reservoir. From there proceed over Port Hill , Nickie's Knowe and Talla East Side to Lochcraig Head and back by Firthybrig Head, Molls Cleuch Dod and Carlavin Hill to the Megget Stane.

After independence the private utility was nationalized, but in the mid-1990s the Moroccan government privatized water and sewer services again, alongside electricity distribution, in four cities. The privatization process began with the award of the Casablanca concession to Lyonnaise des Eaux (now SUEZ) in 1997, followed by the award of a concession for the capital Rabat in 1998 and the award of another concession for Tangiers and Tetouan to Veolia Environnement. In 2009 private companies provided water and sanitation services to 38% of the urban population of the country.  History  At the time of the French protectorate of Morocco beginning in 1912 the water supply of Casablanca, Rabat, Sal√©, Tangiers and Meknes was provided by the French private company Soci√©t√© Marocaine de Distribution d'eau, de gaz et d'√©lectricit√© (SMD), a subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux, under concession contracts. These contracts were terminated when Morocco became independent in 1956, at which time municipal public utilities became responsible for water supply and electricity distribution in the major cities of the Kingdom.Claude de Miras and Xavier Godard:Les firmes concessionnaires de service public au Maroc : eau potable, assainissement et transport collectifs, in:M√©diterran√©e, No. 106 (2006), p. 114-117 Casablanca. In the early 1990s the municipal public utility R√©gie Autonome Intercommunale de Distribution d'Eau et d'Electricit√© de Casablanca (RAD) had a poor service record. Therefore, \\"after the direct intervention of King Hassan\\" the government decided in the mid-1990s to bring in a private company to manage the city's water, sewerage and power networks. Lyonnaise des Eaux under its CEO J√©r√¥me Monod, a close adviser of Jacques Chirac, negotiated the contract with the Interior Ministry under Driss Basri. The lengthy negotiations process for the contract was accompanied by intense criticism from the press, the Moroccan trade association Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale des Entreprises du Maroc, and city councilors.Middle East Economic Digest:\\"No smooth course for private water\\", 7 March 1997, p.2-3 Finally a consortium led by Lyonnaise des Eaux (now SUEZ), was awarded the 30-year concession without a competitive tender. Lyonnaise des Eaux thus returned to a city where it had already provided services for almost half a century. The consortium was called Lydec and originally included Lyonnaise des Eaux (35%), Elyo (24%), Agbar (5%), EdF (18%) and Endesa (Spain) (18%). The contract was signed on April 28, 1997, between J√©r√¥me Monod, CEO of Lyonnaise des Eaux, and Abdelmoughit Slimani, President of the Council of Greater Casablanca (Communaut√© Urbaine de Casablanca). Claude de Miras and Xavier Godard:Les firmes concessionnaires de service public au Maroc:eau potable, assainissement et transport collectifs, in:M√©diterrann√©e, No. 106 (2006), p. 113-124 In 2008 the concession contract was renegotiated to provide a better balance between the two partners, limiting the rate of return of the concessionnaire from 14.6% to 11.7% and requiring him to increase his investments by Dirham 1bn. Also, automatic tariff increases will now be limited to specific situations such as increases in bulk water or electricity tariffs. Lavie√©co:Tarifs de l‚Äôeau et de l‚Äô√©lectricit√© : Lydec fait des concessions, March 21, 2008 Rabat. After direct negotiations in 1998, a concession for Rabat was signed in January 1999 with REDAL, a company consisting of a Portuguese partner (Electrocidade), a Spanish company (Urbaser) and a Moroccan company (Alborada). The concession met with problems from the very beginning. According to a presentation by Moroccan government officials, \\"the firm was not ready\\" the four partners were not coordinated, the start-up was slow contractual obligations were not fulfilled leading to tumultuous meetings, contestation of bills and protests. As a result, the founding shareholders transferred their equity in REDAL to Vivendi Environnement.Hassan Nouha (Ministry of Interior), Mehdi Berradi (Delegated Management Control Department in Casablanca), Mohammed Dinia (Delegated Management Control Department in Rabat-Sale) and Mustapha El Habti (Delegated Management Control Department in Tangiers):Public-Private Partnerships ‚Äì The Case of Morocco, International Development Research Center Water Demand Management Forum, Amman, October 2002 Tangiers and Tetouan. The concession in Tangiers and Tetouan covering 23 municipalities with 1.1 million inhabitants was awarded in January 2002 after competitive bidding. Seven bids were received, of which one was discarded for non-conformity. The six offers included groups led by Lyonnaise des Eaux (France), Enron (USA), Thames Water (UK), Union Fenosa (Spain) SAUR (France) and Vivendi (France). The bids were evaluated on the basis of technical and financial criteria combined in a single score. The contract was awarded to the group led by Vivendi, which used the brand name Amendis. The formal name of the group is Soci√©t√© des eaux et d'√©lectricit√© du Nord (SEEN), consisting of Vivendi, Hydro-Qu√©bec International (Canada) and ONA (Morocco).  Regulation  The public counterparts (delegating authorities) of the concessions in Morocco are the municipalities. Each delegating authority has set up a technical committee to regulate the contracts, comprising representatives of the municipality, the Ministry of Interior and the concessionnaire. The committee reviews work plans and reports. In addition, about one year after the contracts in Casablanca and Rabat were signed local supervisory commissions were set up. Also, a supervisory commission was created at the national level. As of 2002, the government concluded that the members representing the delegating authority in the technical committee in Casablanca felt constrained by a lack of expertise compared to the specialists from the private concessionnaire. On the other hand, the concessionnaire felt that there was interference in the management of the services. This improved somewhat after the local supervisory commission was set up in Casablanca. This experience influenced the design of the concession contracts in Tangiers and Tetouan where clauses to protect consumers were added and local supervisory commissions were included in contract design from the beginning.  Investment  Lydec's 30-year investment plan totals 30 billion Moroccan Dirham. According to one source 21 billion of this sum will come from connection fees paid by new customers into a fund, 8.2 billion would come from Bank loans and internal cash generation, and 0.8 billion would be in the form of equity to be raised by the subsidiary running the concession. According to another source the concessionnaire will not provide any significant equity, nor will it borrow significant debt. Instead it will generate 87.8% of its contribution of 6.3 billion Dirham by using its technical and commercial know-how to mobilize funding from its customers. The remainder would be mobilized through connection fees. According to Lydec, the company invested 7.7 billion Dirham between 1997 and 2008, of which the company financed 4.4 billion. 33% of the investment was for sanitation, 23% for water supply, 34% for electricity and 10% were investments that benefited all three sectors. A substantial share of the investments in sanitation were dedicated to storm water management. Lydec:Investissements, accessed on October 10, 2009  Outcomes  Casablanca. According to Lydec, surveys show that more than 90% of its customers have noticed improvements: shorter waiting time at customer centers, simplified procedures, quicker repairs, more reliable billing and less inundations. In particular, Lydec built the Western collector, a 4.7 km underground stormwater drain with a capacity of 40 m3/s. Also, the company says that it saved 25 million cubic meters of drinking water in 2002 compared to the situation before the concession. Lydec:Carte de visite, accessed on October 10, 2009 Other cities. According to Amendis, during the first five years of its concession in Tangiers and Tetouan it expanded the wastewater collection and treatment system in the two cities and provided 40,000 subsidized water and wastewater connections.Veolia Water:Tangier and Tetouan ‚Äì Morocco. Water, wastewater and electricity services, accessed on October 10, 2009 The level of non-revenue water has been reduced from 32% in 2002 to 19% in 2008 in Rabat, and from 41% to 21% in Tangiers, according to Veolia.Global Water Intelligence:Debtors impact Veolia Maroc's cashflow, February 2010, p.8  Tariffs  Casablanca. According to the Casablanca concession contract, tariffs are adjusted annually based on a price index defined in the contract. If the resulting tariff increase is less than 3% it is applied automatically. If it is more than 3% the private company and the state decide about the measures to be taken. If no decision is taken within two months, the company can apply a 3% tariff increase while the contracting parties decide about how to deal with the remaining tariff increase. Increases in bulk water tariffs and in electricity production tariffs are passed on automatically to consumers, based on the principle \\"no loss, no gain\\". Between 1997 and 2001 the average water tariff in Casablanca increased by 35% and the average sewerage tariff by 34%. However, the electricity tariff decreased by 6%. During public management by RAD water tariffs had increased by 60% between 1990 and 1995. However, this increase had to a large extent been due to an increase in bulk water tariffs charged by ONEP to RAD. Dominique Lorrain:Multiutilit√© √† Casablanca, CEMS, CNRS/EHESS, Juin 2002, p. 14-15 Other cities. Concerning the concessions by Veolia, tariff increases in the 2007‚Äì10 period were lower than contractually required, according to Veolia. The company claims that the government owes it Dirham 93 million (US$11.5 million) because of unimplemented tariff increases. Increases in the tariffs for bulk water supplied by the public company ONEP to the private companies, as well as increases in electricity tariffs, cannot automatically be passed on to consumers.

Crosby Villa has its own Parish Council; Crosscanonby Parish Council. History During the Roman period, there was a settlement near to the site of modern Crosby Villa called Garborough. The modern village was built to provide housing for miners at Rosegill and Bullgill coal mines during the 19th century. In addition to the seventy terraced houses, a chapel, shops, and a post office were provided, along with allotments for gardening. The chapel was built in 1863. There was no school, however, and the miners' children walked to Crosby to attend the school there. Near to Bullgill coal mine was Bullgill railway station, approximately from Crosby Villa, on the Maryport and Carlisle Railway (now a part of the Cumbrian Coast Line). Bullgill pit closed in 1897, and Rosegill a few years later. This began a period of hardship for the village, exacerbated by the General Strike of 1926. Bullgill railway station closed to passengers in 1960, a few years before the Beeching axe. A road haulage firm called Duncan Hill was established in nearby Dearham in 1951, and later relocated to Crosby Villa, from where it continues to operate.

The VHP was founded in 1964 by M. S. Golwalkar and S. S. Apte in collaboration with Swami Chinmayananda. Its stated objective is \\"to organise, consolidate the Hindu society and to serve and protect the Hindu Dharma\\". The VHP is a member of the Sangh Parivar group, an umbrella of Hindu nationalist organisations led by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). It has been involved in construction and renovation of Hindu temples, issues of cow slaughter, religious conversion, the Ayodhya dispute and its role in the Babri Masjid demolition. In 2018 the CIA classified Vishva Hindu Parishad as a militant religious organisation.  History  The VHP was founded in 1964 by RSS leaders M. S. Golwalkar and S. S. Apte in collaboration with the Hindu spiritual leader Chinmayananda. The delegation of the founders included Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan founder K. M. Munshi, Gujarati scholar Keshavram Kashiram Shastri, Sikh leader Master Tara Singh, Namdhari Sikh leader Satguru Jagjit Singh and eminent politicians such as C. P. Ramaswamy Iyer. Chinmayananda was nominated as its founding President, while Apte was nominated as its founding General Secretary. It was decided at the meeting that the name of the proposed organisation would be \\"Vishva Hindu Parishad\\" and that a world convention of Hindus was to be held at Prayag (Allahabad) during Kumbha Mela of 1966 for its launch. It was further decided that it would be a non-political organisation and that no office bearer of any political party shall be simultaneously an office bearer in the Parishad. In mid 1990s, VHP had 1.6 million members worldwide. According to a 2008 estimate, VHP claimed 6.8 million members. Ideology The VHP, which considers Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs as well as native tribal religions as part of the greater Hindu fraternity, officially mentions that it was founded by the \\"Saint Shakti of Bharat\\". The VHP was first mooted at a conference in Pawai, Sandipani Sadhanalaya, Bombay on 29 August 1964. The conference was hosted by RSS chief M. S. Golwalkar. The date was chosen to coincide with the festival of Janmashtami. Several representatives from the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist and Jain faiths were present in the meeting, as well as the Dalai Lama. Golwalkar explained that \\"all faiths of Indian origins need to unite\\", saying that the word \\"Hindu\\" (people of \\"Hindustan\\") applied to adherents of all the above religions. Apte declared: Its main objective is \\"to organise, consolidate the Hindu society and to serve, protect the Hindu Dharma\\". It has been involved in social service projects and in encouraging the construction and renovation of Hindu temples. It is against the caste system, and opposes cow slaughter and conversions to other religions. Defending Hindus around the world and Hindu rights has been one of its stated objectives. The other main objective which it has been involved with is the Ayodhya dispute. On 4 June 2018, CIA classified VHP and Bajrang Dal as religious militant organizations under the category of political pressure groups. The organisation acts under the guidance from Dharma Sansad, a religious parliament of Gurus. The VHP is associated with the Sangh Parivar, an umbrella of Hindu nationalist organisations. Its slogan is Dharmo rak·π£ati rak·π£ita·∏•, which means \\"Dharma protects its protector\\" and its symbol is the Banyan tree. The current international president of VHP is Vishnu Sadashiv Kokje, while its international working president is Alok Kumar Advocate.  Social services  Vishva Hindu Parishad is active in social welfare work: * Medical training ‚Äì People are trained in villages to provide primary health care and referral services. The organisation also conducts medical check-up camps. * Vocational training ‚Äì Organisation is running self-employment training camps in Bihar, Punjab, Rajasthan, Maha Kaushal, Assam, Brij Pradesh, Odisha and Maharashtra. The training areas involve farming techniques, bee- keeping, agriculture, horticultural techniques, animal husbandry and sewing. There are 959 training centres currently operating. * Education ‚Äì It tried to provide educational facilities in remote area. It supports 3266 educational facilities. * Social welfare ‚Äì The organisation runs 45 orphanages, marriage bureaux, help centres, rescue centres, temples, hostels and working women's hostels. VHP is also active in environmental causes such as tree plantations. Social services are provided in religious pilgrimages, emergency help during natural calamities and rural development. * Relief services ‚Äì Vishwa Hindu Parishad has provided emergency relief services. In the 2014 Jammu and Kashmir floods, Vishwa Hindu Parishad organised medical and relief camps. These services provided relief via medical camps to 1400 patients.  Youth organisations  Local office of Vishva Hindu Parishad, at Haridwar The Bajrang Dal founded in 1984, is organised in many states in major training camps called shakhas, where thousands of youths simultaneously train in various activities, receive sports, education in Hindutva and cultural indoctrination. The Durga Vahini, founded in 1991 under the tutelage of Sadhvi Rithambara as its founding chairperson and the support of the VHP, is described as the \\"female arm of the Dal\\". Members of the Vahini contend that the portrayal of their group as a branch of the Bajrang Dal is an oversimplification, and that their goals are to \\"dedicate ourselves to spiritual, physical, mental and knowledge development\\".Women 'Ram Bhakt' hog limelight,The Tribune The VHP also have divisions made up of women. VHP secretary Giri Raj Kishore charted out highly visible roles for women in the group. He charted out two \\"satyagrahas\\" for women during their demonstrations. The VHP has been a prime backer of the World Hindu Conference in which issues such as casteism, sectarianism, and the future of Hindus were discussed. Prior Conferences have included Hindu Groups such as Parisada Hindu Dharma.  International presence  Vishwa Hindu Parishad has presence in 29 countries outside of India. The Australia wing of Vishva Hindu Parishad conducts activities such as conducting weekend schools, language classes, cultural workshops, festivals. The festivals are also organised for open to all communities promoting Unity in Diversity. The press release from city council of Holroyd states that Vishva Hindu Parishad is active in supporting multiculturalism in the same region. Logo Hindu Students Council (also known as HSC) is an organization of Hindu students in the United States of America and Canada. The HSC was set up in 1990 with support from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad of America; its current association with that body is a matter of some debate, though it says that it became fully independent in 2003.http://www.hscnet.org/fact.php Prior to its separation from its parent organization, it was considered to be the student-wing of the VHP.2003 Yearbook, the Centre for the Study of Global Governance, London School of Economics\\"The Struggle for India's Soul\\", Mira Kamdar, World Policy Journal.\\"Negotiating Hindu Identities in America\\", by Diana Eck, in The South Asian Religious Diaspora in Britain, Canada, and the United States Raymond Brady Williams, Harold G.

In 2011, Hindu Students Council was awarded a Readers' Choice Award for Best Hindu Organization in an online vote held by About.com. Other activities VHP organises programmes to promote return or reconversion of Hindus who were previously converted to Christianity or Islam through their trained missionaries called Dharma Prasaar Vibhag (Dharma Propagation Unit), some of them were sent to remote villages and tribal areas which have substantial Christians and Muslims population. From 1982 to 1985, over 66,000 people were reconverted to Hinduism following the efforts of VHP. The VHP had been aggressively involved in the Ayodhya dispute over the Ram Janmabhoomi, or Babri Mosque before its demolition, since March 1984, after getting encouraged by the strong response it had got from ekatmata yatra programme, it organised in 1983, which was aimed at Hindu unity and self- protection against Islam and Christianity. This activity in the Ayodhya issue involved demonstrations, petitions and litigation, along with militant processions, forceful conversion ceremonies and incidents of violence and vandalism, particularly targeting Muslims. The VHP is also said to have sought the destruction of the Babri mosque. According to the VHP and its affiliated organisations, the Babri Mosque was built by demolishing the temple at the birthplace of Rama (Ram Janmabhoomi) by the Mughal Emperor Babur in the 16th century. It further stated in Allahabad court documentation that the building was in a dilapidated condition. It was in ruins and could not be used for worship or any activities. In Punjab, the VHP has played an active role to prevent conversions of Sikhs. Majority of them are low caste Sikhs converting to Christianity. This may be a result of oppression by high caste Sikhs but there are considerable free will conversions among the higher class Sikhs too; however, the VHP have forcibly stopped Christian missionaries from converting Sikhs. According to the Human Rights Watch, VHP and Bajrang Dal had been involved in 2002 Gujarat riots. Though VHP has denied these claims, VHP spokesman Kaushikbahi Mehta said, \\"We in the VHP had nothing to do with the violence except to take care of widows and victims of the Godhra mayhem.\\" VHP engaged in \\"re-conversion\\" program in the state of Orissa. In June 2002, VHP converted 143 tribal Christians into Hinduism in Tainser village of Sundergarh district. In 2005, VHP in Bargarh carried out reconversion ceremony for 567 Christians. The new converts had signed affidavits, confirming their intention to change their religion. Another 600 Dalit tribal Christians were converted to Hinduism in Bijepur, Orissa. On April 2005, in West Bengal members of 45 tribal families converted to Hinduism from Christianity in a ceremony organised by Akhil Bhartiya Sanatan Santhal, allied to VHP. VHP claimed to have converted 5,000 people to Hinduism in 2002. In 2004, VHP claimed to have converted 12,857 people to Hinduism. 3,727 of these were Muslims and 9,130 were Christians. In 2005, after the protests organised by VHP, the Jharkhand Assembly passed a Cow Protection Commission Bill that made the killing of, cruelty to and illegal trading of cows a crime. In 2007, VHP had launched nationwide protest against demolition of the Rama Setu. On 12 September 2007, the VHP, with the aid of BJP and the Rameswaram Sreeramsetu Surakshaya Manch, had blocked road and rail traffic in Orissa. Thousands of activists participated in these protests in Bhubaneswar, Jatani, Rourkela, and Sambalpur. In 2015, VHP defended the demolition of a church in Haryana, although it has denied involvement in the incident. VHP joint general secretary Surendra Jain alleged that the church was built \\"for the purpose of aggressive conversion\\" and likened its destruction to the violence of the 1857 war which he claimed \\"was fought for the cause of religion\\".

It has since had various uses. The Wool House was built in the late 14th century to store wool for export to Italy. In the early 19th century it was used as a prison for Napoleonic French prisoners of war. The building was restored by Southampton City Corporation and adapted to house the Southampton Maritime Museum, which opened in June 1966 and moved to SeaCity Museum in January 2012. It is a Grade I listed building. A plaque on the wall of The Wool House records its history: The Wool House plaque > This building was erected in the 14th century for the storage of wool before > export to the continent in the galleys and carracks of Venice and Genoa. The > wool trade was the basis of Southampton's prosperity in the middle ages. > During the Napoleonic wars The Wool House was used to accommodate French > prisoners of war, some of whose names may be seen carved on the beams of the > roof. This building was restored by the city corporation and opened as a > Maritime Museum in June 1966. During the early part of the 20th century, the premises were occupied by The Moonbeam Engineering Company Limited who built motor launches and later expanded to include the sale of wrought iron propellers and marine engines for export around the world. Edwin Moon used a corner of the workshop to realise his dream of constructing and flying an aircraft of his own design which he flew from land at North Stoneham in 1910, on fields which subsequently became Southampton International Airport. The Maritime Museum, housed here from 1966 to 2012, documented the maritime heritage of Southampton and the Solent area, its history as a base for ocean liners and in particular its connections to RMS Titanic. Its mission statement was: \\"To collect, preserve, display and interpret artefacts and information to reflect the widest range of history of the city and its people; to promote enjoyment, awareness of the engagement with Southampton's heritage, via the presentation of the life of the city and its people.\\"UKMCS In June 2013, with permission from Southampton City Council, The Wool House was opened up by Element Arts, a pop-up arts organisation, who use the space as a gallery and community arts venue featuring exhibitions and live events - music, dance, poetry, theatre, plus workshops for all ages. Element Arts had the Wool House for a short time on a rolling month by month basis. Plans were approved in 2014 to allow the Dancing Man Brewery to turn the building into a microbrewery and pub. The Wool House reopened on 27 February 2015 as a brewpub/restaurant.

Life Dobson was born on 17 October 1908 to William Dobson, a shipbuilder, and his wife Laura. He was admitted to Charterhouse School in 1922, matriculating to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1926. He graduated in 1930 with a first class degree in law, and was added to the rolls as a solicitor in 1933. Moving to London he spent a year in a City firm before, disenchanted, joining a company of parliamentary draftsmen. During the Second World War, Dobson served with the Royal Air Force, and was appointed an OBE in 1945. Suffering from tuberculosis he was unable to join the legal branch of the Foreign Office, and he instead joined the Statutory Publications Office, part of HM Treasury. There the Treasury Solicitor, Sir Thomas Barnes, introduced him to Albert Napier, the Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office, who offered him a job. Accepting, he transferred to the Lord Chancellor's Department in April 1947, and was soon recognised as a potential future Permanent Secretary. With this in mind he qualified as a barrister, and was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple in 1951. After Napier retired, Dobson became the assistant to the new Permanent Secretary, George Coldstream, and when Coldstream retired in 1968 Dobson was made Permanent Secretary and knighted. Dobson was made a KCB in 1969, and a Queen's Counsel in 1971. Initially a reformer, by the time he became Permanent Secretary Dobson had become more conservative in his outlook, and is believed to have prevented several Lord Chancellors from making reforming actions. This was a particularly bad time for a conservative Permanent Secretary, since the report of the Beeching Commission and the transformation of the small Lord Chancellor's Department into a fully fledged government office needed a more radical Permanent Secretary. Dobson retired in 1977, sitting as a member of the Advisory Council on Public Records until 1983, and died on 15 December 1995.

It was first published as chapters in the Tamil weekly magazine Kungumam in 1981. The historical background is set at the time of Vijayalaya's establishment of the Imperial Cholas reign by capturing Vanchi and Tanjore. In the novel, along with Vijayalaya, other historical characters like Adithya, Sthanuravi (a Chera king), Vanasastri (astronomer) Sankaranarayanan and Perumpidugu Mutharayar and fictional characters like Idhayakumaran, Achuthaperaiyar, Ilayavel, Kannazhagi and Devi are present. Plot summary The story begins with Idhayakumaran entering the city of Vanchi, the second capital of Cheras. He is stopped at the entrance by the guards who does not allow him to enter after knowing that he is from Chola country. But Idhayakumaran gallops in his horse into the city. He finds a beautiful ivory statue of a dancing female in the woods within the city. Just as he took the statue in his hand he hears the Chera princess Ranjani ordering her guards to arrest him for steeling the statue. Idhayakumaran escapes from the situation by taking the princess as his hostage. He later releases her and informs her that the secret of her birth will be revealed today in the place of the royal jeweler. The princess meets a stranger along with Achuthaperaiyar, the royal jeweler. Idhayakumaran meets them there along with the statue. Achuthaperaiyar introduces the stranger as Vijayalayan and he is her father. Vijayalayan calls her Kannazhagi. Vijayalayan also mentions that he has just captured Vanchi. He explains that the statue was made by Ilamcetcenni, the legendary Chola king. He also reveals that Achuthaperaiyar as his Chief Minister, and explains that her mother's name is Bhoodevi and he had married her when he was the king of the then tiny Chola country ruling the region around Uraiyur. Once when Vijayalayan was in Pandyan country with Achuthaperaiyar for a week, the Mutharayars of Kalabhras clan raided Uraiyur and tried to abduct Bhoodevi. But she stabbed and killed herself with a dagger. The raiders took with them the three-year-old Kannazhagi. When Vijayalaya Chola returned he vowed to destroy the clan of the raiders. A week later the Chola king went to Kanchi and met the Pallava king and made Cholas a feudal kingdom of the Pallavas. The Pallava king made him the Commander of Pallava army. Vijayalaya led many successful invasion into the Kalabhras country and started to look for you. When she was found (after fifteen years) in Vanchi, Vijayalayan sent Achuthaperaiyar there - which resulted in Vanchi being captured by the Cholas.

One of the few places in the country to breed the three species cranes present in South Africa, the Verloren Vallei Nature Reserve lies roughly outside Dullstroom, a beautiful, peaceful part of the Steenkampsberg plateau that includes rolling grasslands and sensitive wetlands. Guided tours around the reserve to sight the blue crane, the wattled crane and the Grey crowned crane are by appointment only - the reserve is an international Ramsar wetlands site and enjoys international importance. An interlinked series of over 30 wetlands are home to significant birds, including red data species, so it is understandable that Verloren Vallei Nature Reserve is serious about providing safe refuge to its countless birds. An ongoing project to save the wattle crane from extinction collects the second eggs produced by these birds for incubation. These chicks are then reared in isolation in a specially designed facility on the reserve, looked after by people in crane suits so that they do not imprint on humans. Once they are 6 months old, they are released into the wild in an attempt to boost their dwindling numbers. Open grasslands are home to the bald ibis, pitpits, larks, cisticolas, long-tailed shrikes, red bishops and finches, whilst the rockier parts of the reserve attract the mountain chat, ground woodpecker, the scarce grey-winged and red-winged francolin and the Cape rock thrush. Verloren Vallei also includes animals such as the oribi, steenbok, brown hyena, caracal, serval cat, jackal, otters and zebras, wildebeest and blesbok have been reintroduced.

Type specimen  It is based on a unique specimen collected by Henry Charles Rawnsley at Witton, near Brisbane in Queensland, Australia, on 14 July 1867. It was described and illustrated (as Ptilonorhynchus rawnsleyi) in the same year by Silvester Diggles in Part 15 of his three-volume work The Ornithology of Australia.Diggles (1867). It has at various times been considered to be a valid bowerbird species, an aberrant individual of the satin bowerbird, or an adult hybrid individual resulting from the natural crossing of a regent bowerbird with a satin bowerbird.Frith & Frith (2004), p.387.Blunt & Frith (2004).

He owns Abkhazia's only private television station Abaza TV and is the chairman of the Party of the Economic Development of Abkhazia. Butba was an unsuccessful candidate in the December 2009 presidential election. Early life and education Beslan Butba was born on 7 February 1960 in the village of Chlou in the Ochamchira District of the Abkhazian ASSR. In 1983 he graduated from the Institute for Engineering and Construction in Moscow. In 2009, Butba obtained his Candidate of Sciences degree in Moscow, and in March 2011, his Doctor of Sciences degree in Tula at the Russian Interdisciplinary Centre for Ergonomic Research and Development. Business career After graduation in 1983, Butba began working for the Repair and Construction Department No. 1 of Moscow. Three years later he became head of the department. Butba first entered business when in 1989 he founded a cooperation in Moscow. He returned to Abkhazia in 1990 where he also started to do business. In 2005 he became head of the Business Club Sukhum. In 2007 he founded Abaza TV, Abkhazia's first private Television channel, which started broadcasting at 19:30 on 26 June 2007. Butba also owns the newspaper Ekho Abkhazii.  Political career  Member of Parliament (2002 ‚Äì 2007) Beslan Butba was a member of the People's Assembly of Abkhazia from 2002 until 2007, and he headed the Committee for Interparliamentary Relations. In 2007, he failed to be re-elected. He then founded and became Chairman of the Party of the Economic Development of Abkhazia, which held its first congress on 26 September 2007. 2009 Presidential election On 23 October 2009 Butba was nominated by his party for the December 2009 presidential election, running together with former Interior Minister Almasbei Kchach as Vice Presidential candidate. The pair came in fourth place with 8.25% of the vote share. Member of Parliament (2012 ‚Äì 2014) In 2012, Besla Butba was again elected to Parliament for constituency no. 26 in his native Chlou, in a by- election organised after the sudden death of newly elected deputy Temur Logua. He was nominated by an initiative group on 12 June. In the first round on 22 July 2012, Butba won a plurality of 920 votes out of 2040. In the second round on 5 August, Butba defeated Beslan Tarba by winning 1125 out of 2193 votes. On 1 February 2013, Butba was appointed Special Representative of the President for cooperation with the countries of South and Middle America. Prime Minister (2014 ‚Äì 2015) Following the 2014 Abkhazian political crisis and the resignation of President Alexander Ankvab and several other officials, including Vice Premier Beslan Eshba, Butba was appointed as acting Vice Premier on 13 June. Accordingly, Butba's membership of Parliament was terminated on 18 June. During the election to succeed Ankvab as President, Butba campaigned with opposition leader Raul Khajimba as his Prime Ministerial candidate. Khajimba won a narrow first-round victory and Butba was appointed as Prime Minister on 29 September. In November 2014, Butba, driving his car without security guards, was attacked and beaten by two drunken men, who were later detained and brought to police for questioning. Butba was briefly hospitalized in a Sukhumi hospital and treated for concussion. There were rumors of Butba's resignation almost since the beginning of his term, explained variously by a power struggle between Butba and Khajimba and by Butba's supposed bad performance as Prime Minister. Butba was finally dismissed by President Khajimba on 16 March 2015, and temporarily replaced by First Vice Premier Shamil Adzynba. In a press conference afterwards, Butba said that he had made Khajimba aware of his intention to resign. He claimed that the Presidential Administration had taken over many of the responsibilities of the Prime Minister, creating a 'second government'. Plenipotentary Representative of the President (since 2015) On 21 April 2015, Butba was appointed Plenipotentary Representative of the President of Abkhazia for Trade and Economic Cooperation with Foreign Countries, with the rank of Vice Premier. In the night of 8 April 2016, Butba's car was burned down in front of his house. Butba was in Moscow at the time but his family was at home.

It was produced by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It is notable as Australia's first locally produced science fiction television series and one of the first Australian TV series to be sold overseas. Synopsis A schoolmaster finds an unconscious young man on his doorstep, takes him in and looks after him. A firm friendship develops between the stranger and the headmaster's children Bernard and Jean and their friend Peter, leading them to discover the stranger's secret: that he is from another planet and has been sent to find a new home on Earth for his people. The stranger, Adam, is joined by fellow alien Varossa. They live in a society without books where they memorise everything. In the second series the children have to enlist the help of the Australian Prime Minister when Peter is kidnapped by the alien, and a procession of intrigues eventually leads them to the aliens' home planet of Soshuniss. Production The Stranger began life as a six-part radio series, broadcast on the BBC Home Service from December 1963. This was written by New Zealand-born author G.K. Saunders and starred David Spenser as \\"The Stranger\\", Adam Suisse. The Australian TV version followed four months later, again scripted by Saunders, produced by Storry Walton and directed by Gil Brealey, with production design by Geoffrey Wedlock. Two series of six episodes each were produced in 1964 and 1965. It was a major hit in Australia and was sold back to the BBC. The series starred leading stage and radio actor Ron Haddrick as \\"The Stranger\\"; the children were played by Janice Dinnen and Bill Levis as Jean and Bernard (Bernie) Walsh and Michael Thomas as their friend Peter Cannon. The supporting cast included John Faassen as Mr Walsh and Jessica Noad as Mrs Walsh, Owen Weingott as Professor Mayer, Chips Rafferty as the Prime Minister, Reg Livermore as Varossa and Mary Mackay as the female Soshun and Ben Gabriel as the male Soshun. Other actors include Ronne Arnold (Dr Kamutsa - UN), Henry Gilbert (Hutchins - UN), Bernie Baia (Dr Matoula - UN), Bill Levey, Ivor Bromley as Colonel Nash, and British actor Grant Taylor as Detective Inspector Chisholm and Jeffrey Hodgson as Detective Howell. Other minor roles are as follows: Robert McDarra plays the Squadron Leader, Denys Burrows is the Chief Police Inspector, Keith Buckley is John Robinson, Stewart Ginn is Senator Anderson and Nigel Lovell plays Group Captain Ponsonby. John Fegan (Homicide) and Douglas Morgan play Police officers. Alex Cann plays Rudolph Lindenberger, Dennis Carroll is Edward Mayer, and Don Philps is Wilson. Notable actors playing Soshuniss Elders include Max Phipps and Reg Evans. Istosin, the pilot of the guide ship, was played by John Unicomb and the pilot of the saucer later in the series is Scott Taylor. Judy Nunn plays a minor role in episode 7. The Lord Mayor was played by Gordon Glenwright, the Lady Mayoress by Thelma Scott and the Town Clerk by Barry Ross. The series was also notable for the fact that Saunders devised a special language that the aliens spoke amongst themselves and, like later science fiction series such as Babylon 5, they spoke English with a \\"foreign\\" accent; in the story Adam can speak German and French, and this leads to the children's father's initial assumption that he is from Switzerland (whence his surname; Adam comes from Adam and Eve). The series was made with cooperation from the CSIRO with pivotal scenes shot on location at the Parkes Observatory and the facility's radio telescope featured in the iconic opening title sequence. The CSIRO were also consulted on the design of the alien spacecraft that lands on the steps of the Sydney Town Hall where the aliens are greeted by the Prime Minister, played by veteran Australian screen star Chips Rafferty. In 2019 the entire series was digitally restored by the ABC and in January 2020 was released on their on demand service iview and the ABC TV & iview YouTube channel. Episodes Series 1 (1964) Series 2 (1965) Adaptation Over a decade after the series was produced, Saunders wrote a book adaptation which was published by Whitcombe & Tombs in 1978.

Overview Commissioned by the Ort√≠z Basualdo family of Buenos Aires, the villa on Mar del Plata's prestigious Stella Maris Hill was built in 1909 as a summer residence. Designed by Luis Dubois and Pablo Pater, the eclecticist, the art nouveau villa followed a picturesque movement in French architecture common to new, upscale residences in both France and Argentina, at the time (the exterior's half-timber motif, accordingly, was painted on). The structure, predominantly in stone, was capped by zinc mansard roofing.Patrimonio Marplatense: Villa Ortiz Basualdo The oceanfront city was given its first municipal museum of fine art in 1938, when the facility was inaugurated in the Mar del Plata City Hall. The museum gathered a collection of mainly modern art in subsequent decades, and in particular works by local realist painter and muralist Juan Carlos Castagnino.Welcome Argentina: Museo Castagnino The donation of the villa by the Ort√≠z Basualdo family resulted in the museum's relocation, and the institution was re-inaugurated therein on July 9, 1980. The family's donation included a large selection of furniture acquired between 1909 and the villa's remodel in 1918. The collection, designed by Belgian architect and cabinetmaker Gustave Serrurier-Bovy, is widely considered among the world's finest of its type, and was incorporated into the museum's exhibits. The museum's collections feature nearly 600 paintings, sculptures, lithographs, photographs and other works, including those by Argentine artists Antonio Berni, Alberto Bruzzone, Prilidiano Pueyrred√≥n, Luis Seoane, Ra√∫l Soldi, and Juan Carlos Castagnino, for whom the museum was renamed in 1982, and of whom the museum houses 138 works.

Early life Colquhoun was born on 15 March 1921 at Hanwell, Middlesex and was educated at Ealing. Royal Air Force He joined the Royal Air Force in August 1940 and trained as a pilot. His first posting was to 603 Squadron where he flew the Supermarine Spitfire on operations over France and convoy protection patrols. Later in 1941 Colquhoun was delivering a photographic reconnaissance Spitfire to Cairo but during a stop at Malta he was ordered to join 69 Squadron when the it was decided that their need for a PR Spitfire was more important. For nine months in 1941 and 1942 Colquhoun flew operational sorties in his unarmed and pale blue painted Spitfire over Italy. By the time more aircraft arrived in May 1942 aboard HMS Eagle Colquhoun had carried out 154 operational sorties. For his work with 69 Squadron Sergeant Colquhoun was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal and commissioned as a Pilot Officer. Colquhoun returned to the United Kingdom where he trained to fly the photographic reconnaissance variant of de Havilland Mosquito at 2 OTU in Scotland. In 1943 he joined 682 Squadron based in Algeria and later moved to Italy. He stayed with the squadron until October 1944 and carried out 262 operational sorties. For his work with 682 Squadron he was awarded the DFC. After a short period as an instructor at 2 OTU he was posted to Vickers Supermarine as a production test pilot. He was part of a team that test flew Spitfires as they left the production lines. Test pilot In 1946 when he left the RAF he was invited to remain at Vickers as part of the test flying team. He soon showed an aptitude for testing new types and was soon involved in the testing of new naval fighters the jet-powered Attacker and Scimitar. In May 1950 Colquhoun was flying an Attacker to test the effectiveness of the air brakes. On the third of two dives the outer portion of the starboard wing folded up and the ailerons became locked. Colquhoun decided not to eject and managed to do a high-speed landing at Chilbolton, he used all but the last 100 yards (90m) of the runway and burst a tyre. He had saved the aircraft so the cause could be discovered and was awarded the George Medal for his efforts. Hovercraft Colquhoun was soon testing the new hovercraft being produced by Vickers and went on to become operations manager of Vickers' Hovercraft division. In 1962 Colquhoun piloted a Vickers VA-3 on the first public hovercraft service which was between Wallasey and Rhyl. In 1966 he joined Hoverlloyd as operational manager for the cross channel hovercraft service, he later becoming managing director. When Hoverlloyd was taken over by Seaspeed he then ran their jetfoil service to Dieppe. Later life Colquhoun became custodian of Chiddingstone Castle before he retired to live at Broadstairs in Kent. He died in 2001 leaving a wife and four daughters. Honours and awards * 1 August 1950 ‚Äì Leslie Robert Colquhoun, DFC, DFM, Civil Test Pilot, Vickers Armstrongs Ltd., Supermarine Works.

It was built in 1612 to mark the end of the Acqua Paola aqueduct, restored by Pope Paul V, and took its name from him. It was the first major fountain on the right bank of the River Tiber.Marilyn Symmes with Maria Ann Conelli, Fountains as Refreshment\\" in Fountains, Splash and Spectacle, Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present. pg. 36.  History  The Fontana dell'Acqua Paola was inspired by the popularity of the Fontana dell'Acqua Felice, built in 1585-88 by Pope Sixtus V. Pope Paul V decided to rebuild and extend the ruined Acqua Traiana aqueduct built by the Emperor Trajan in order to create a source of clean drinking water for the residents of the Janiculum Hill, who were forced to take their water from brackish springs or from the polluted Tiber. He raised funds for his project in part by imposing a tax upon wine, which caused complaints among some residents.D'Onofrio, 1962, pg. 141-148 The funding from this tax and other sources allowed him to purchase the rights to the water of a spring near Lake Bracciano, not far from Rome, as the source for the fountain.Marilyn Symmes, pg. 36 The fountain was designed by Giovanni Fontana, whose brother had worked on the Fontana dell'Acqua Felice, and Flaminio Ponzio. They used white marble from the nearby ruins of the Roman Temple of Minerva in the Forum of Nerva, and constructed a massive gateway of five arches for the arrival of the water. At the top of the fountain are the papal tiara and keys, above the Borghese family coat of arms of an eagle and a dragon, supported by angels. The inscription praises Pope Paul in poetic terms for bringing water to the residents of the district. Unlike the Fontana dell'Acqua Felice, which had an abundance of statues on biblical themes, the theme of the Fontana dell'Acqua Paola was water. Five abundant streams poured through the arches into five marble basins. In 1690 Carlo Fontana designed an additional semicircular pool for the water which overflowed from the marble basins. Marble posts were put in place to keep coachmen from watering their animals in the fountain, but the pool was tempting to many local residents, who bathed in the water. An ordinance was issued in 1707 forbidding residents to bathe in the fountain.The ordinance forbade greengrocers, gardeners and vineyard workers from bathing or washing their fruit or vegetables in the fountain. Later decrees banned swimming or bathing. Cited by Marilyn Symmes, pg. 190. See also Sanfilippo, 1996. The form of the fountain served as an inspiration for the later Trevi Fountain. Dedication The Latin dedicatory inscription atop the fountain reads: ::PAVLVS ‚Ä¢ QVINTVS ‚Ä¢ PONTIFEX ‚Ä¢ MAXIMVS ::AQVAM ‚Ä¢ IN ‚Ä¢ AGRO ‚Ä¢ BRACCIANENSI ::SALVBERRIMIS ‚Ä¢ E ‚Ä¢ FONTIBVS ‚Ä¢ COLLECTAM ::VETERIBVS ‚Ä¢ AQVAE ‚Ä¢ ALSIETINAE ‚Ä¢ DVCTIBVS ‚Ä¢ RESTITVTIS ::NOVISQVE ‚Ä¢ ADDITIS ::XXXV ‚Ä¢ AB ‚Ä¢ MILLIARIO ‚Ä¢ DVXIT ::ANNO ‚Ä¢ DOMINI ‚Ä¢ MDCXII ‚Ä¢ PONTIFICATVS ‚Ä¢ SVI ‚Ä¢ SEPTIMO The English line-for-line translation: ::Paul the Fifth, Supreme Pontiff [brought] ::water from the region of Bracciano, ::gathered from the most healthy sources, ::by restoring old channels of the Alsietina* water aqueduct ::and adding new ones, ::from 35 mile-stones away ::in the year of the Lord 1612, the seventh year of his pontificate. *Note: the dedication misidentifies the restored aqueduct as the Alsietina aqueduct, built by emperor Augustus in 2 B.C.E. to supply a Naumachia, a large artificial lake used to stage mock naval combat for entertainment. However, the quality of the water from the Alsietina was poor, and Pope Paul instead restored the aqueduct Traiana, built by emperor Trajan around 109 C.E. In music The American composer Charles T. Griffes wrote a character piece for piano entitled \\"The Fountains of Acqua Paola\\" as part of his Roman Sketches, Op. 7 (composed 1915-16). Griffes never visited Rome or Italy. Rather, the pieces in his collection were inspired by a collection of poems by William Sharp entitled Sospiri di Roma (1891). In cinema The Great Beauty by Paolo Sorrentino opens with a scene taking place in front of the fountain.

The JDK includes a private JVM and a few other resources to finish the development of a Java application. Since the introduction of the Java platform, it has been by far the most widely used Software Development Kit (SDK).  JDK contents  The JDK has as its primary components a collection of programming tools, including: * appletviewer - this tool can be used to run and debug Java applets without a web browser * apt - the annotation-processing tool * extcheck - a utility that detects JAR file conflicts * idlj - the IDL- to-Java compiler. This utility generates Java bindings from a given Java IDL file. * jabswitch - the Java Access Bridge. Exposes assistive technologies on Microsoft Windows systems. * java - the loader for Java applications. This tool is an interpreter and can interpret the class files generated by the javac compiler. Now a single launcher is used for both development and deployment. The old deployment launcher, jre, comes with Sun JDK, and instead it has been replaced by this new java loader. * javac - the Java compiler, which converts source code into Java bytecode * javadoc - the documentation generator, which automatically generates documentation from source code comments * jar - the archiver, which packages related class libraries into a single JAR file. This tool also helps manage JAR files. * javafxpackager - tool to package and sign JavaFX applications * jarsigner - the jar signing and verification tool * javah - the C header and stub generator, used to write native methods * javap - the class file disassembler * javaws - the Java Web Start launcher for JNLP applications * JConsole - Java Monitoring and Management Console * jdb - the debugger * jhat - Java Heap Analysis Tool (experimental) * jinfo - This utility gets configuration information from a running Java process or crash dump.

It accepts an XML schema and generates Java classes. Experimental tools may not be available in future versions of the JDK. The JDK also comes with a complete Java Runtime Environment, usually called a private runtime, due to the fact that it is separated from the \\"regular\\" JRE and has extra contents. It consists of a Java Virtual Machine and all of the class libraries present in the production environment, as well as additional libraries only useful to developers, such as the internationalization libraries and the IDL libraries. Copies of the JDK also include a wide selection of example programs demonstrating the use of almost all portions of the Java API.  Ambiguity between a JDK and an SDK  The JDK forms an extended subset of a software development kit (SDK). It includes \\"tools for developing, debugging, and monitoring Java applications\\". Oracle strongly suggests to now use the term JDK to refer to the Java SE Development Kit. The Java SE SDK is available with or without the JDK, by which they specifically mean the Java SE 7 JDK. \\"Java EE 7 SDK distributions require JDK 7\\" Other JDKs In addition to the most widely used JDK discussed in this article, there are other JDKs commonly available for a variety of platforms, some of which started from the Sun JDK source and some that did not.

It was constructed in 1857 and spans the Genesee River. It has five segmental arches with spans of and rises of . Note: This includes and Accompanying two photographs History The bridge as it was in 1908, painted by Colin Campbell Cooper Previous structures The first bridge on this position, constructed on wooden piers, was built in 1810‚Äì12. The roadway was level with the east bank, meaning that the bridge had to be reached via a ramp from the lower west bank. This bridge was replaced in 1824. Over the first few years of the second bridge's existence, buildings began to be constructed along the bridge, a situation legally permitted due to fact that the river is not navigable at this point. In 1827 a market was constructed on the north side, its west end resting on the Front Street wall and its east end supported by the westernmost pier of the bridge. An early directory described it as consisting of > an open platform, adjoining the bridge, of 20 feet, designed for a vegetable > market; next, a raised platform, in a range with and corresponding to the > sidewalks of Buffalo and Main-streets, of which the market will serve as a > continuation. Next to this, is the covered meat market, having in the center > a walk of 12 feet wide, between two rows of turned columns, and on either > side, the places for stalls, each 10 by 14 feet. By 1830 almost the whole north side of the bridge was occupied by buildings. Those resting entirely on the bridge were made of wood, but there was a four- story structure called the Globe Building at the east end, resting only partly on the bridge. Housing small manufacturing workshops, it had waterwheels housed beneath it. The south side of the bridge remained open. The wooden buildings were destroyed by fire in January 1834. They were, except for the market, soon rebuilt, but a flood in October of the next year removed them again. The flood damage also made the rebuilding of the bridge desirable, and a new structure was begun in 1837. Plans for a stone bridge were dropped, but two stone piers were built and the eastern abutment was raised to lessen the gradient up Main Street hill. The bridge was completed by September, 1838, and its north side was soon occupied by one- and two-storey wooden buildings housing shops, mostly selling clothing or dry goods. Present structure BRIDGE PLAN for 60's redesign Work on the present stone structure began in September 1855, and it was opened in August 1857, although a considerable amount of work remained to be done. Construction of shops on the north side began almost immediately, this time in stone rather than wood, and supported on extensions to the bridge piers and river walls.

First, all of the country's major rivers are shared with neighboring countries, and Syria depends to a large extent on the inflow of water from Turkey through the Euphrates and its tributaries. Second, high population growth and urbanisation increase the pressure on water resources, resulting in localized groundwater depletion and pollution, for example in the Ghouta near Damascus. Third, there is no legal framework for integrated water resources management. Finally, the institutions in charge of water resources management are weak, being both highly centralized and fragmented between sectors, and they often lack the power to enforce regulations. Water resources policies have been focused on the construction of dams, the development of irrigated agriculture and occasional interbasin transfers, such as a pipeline to supply drinking water to Aleppo from the Euphrates. There are 165 dams in Syria with a total storage capacity of 19.6 km¬≥. Demand management through metering, higher tariffs, more efficient irrigation technologies and the reduction of non-revenue water in drinking water supply has received less emphasis than supply management. The government implements a large program for the construction of wastewater treatment plants including the use of reclaimed water for irrigation.  Water resources base  The Euphrates River, shown here near Raqqa, is the most important water source for Syria.  Surface water  The most important rivers of Syria are the Euphrates, the Tigris, the Orontes and the Yarmouk River. All these rivers are shared between Syria and its neighbors. The Euphrates, by far the most important river in Syria, flows from Turkey through Syria to Iraq. In Syria, it is joined by the Khabur and the Balikh rivers, which both originate in the Syro-Turkish border region. The Tigris River originates in the eastern Taurus Mountains in Turkey and forms the border between Syria and Turkey on a small mountainous stretch of the river. Its mean annual flow is 18 km¬≥/year, but very little can be used by Syria due to its remote location. The Orontes River, which flows from Lebanon through Syria to Turkey, has an average flow of 0.4 km¬≥/year (13 m¬≥/s). The water resources of the Yarmouk River, which is shared with Jordan and Israel and flows into the Jordan River, average some 0.4 km¬≥/year (14 m¬≥/s). Among Syria's smaller rivers is the Barada River, which flows through Damascus and is one of the few notable rivers that flows entirely inside Syrian territory. The Quweiq River flows from Turkey to Syria and the city of Aleppo. The Nahr al-Kabir al- Shamali (Northern Great River) rises in Turkey and flows through the northern coastal plain and Latakia. The Nahr al-Kabir al-Janoubi (Southern Great River) flows through the southern coastal plain and, on its lower stretch, forms the border between Syria and Lebanon. It has an average flow of 0.3 km¬≥/year (8 m¬≥/s). Both rivers form part of what is called the \\"coastal basin\\", which is actually a group of small river basins in Syria that drain to the Mediterranean.  International agreements on transboundary rivers  While Syria has signed written agreements with its neighbors on transboundary rivers, none of these agreements is an international treaty that would have to be ratified by the Parliaments of the respective countries. The agreements are rather non-binding memorandums of understanding.Syria Today:Parting the Waters, by John Dagge, January 2010, accessed on January 18, 2010 Euphrates River. In 1989 Iraq and Syria signed a water-sharing agreement under which a maximum of 42% (210 m¬≥/s) of the surface water inflow through the Euphrates granted by Turkey unilaterally to the downstream riparians (500 m¬≥/s) were considered as Syria‚Äôs share.Syria Today:Syrian-Turkish Hydrodiplomacy, by Marwa Daoudy, January 2010, accessed on January 18, 2010 There is no final agreement regarding the Syrian water rights on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. However, since 2005 a group of scholars and retired officials from Syria, Iraq and Turkey initiated Track II diplomacy under the Euphrates-Tigris Initiative for Cooperation. Its aim is to promote cooperation among the three countries, including through a joint data inventory. In March 2008 the three riparian countries formed a joint \\"water institute\\" based in Turkey that will \\"work toward the solution of water-related problems among the three\\".Today's Zaman:Turkey, Iraq, Syria to initiate water talks, 12 March 2000, accessed on October 31, 2009 The Yarmouk River forms the border between Jordan and Syria Orontes River. There is an agreement between Lebanon and Syria over the Orontes signed in 1994, which stipulates that Lebanon receives 80 million cubic meters of water per year \\"if the river flow inside Lebanon is 400 million cubic meters per year or more\\". This means that the risk of drought is borne by Lebanon. No new wells were allowed to be drilled in the Lebanese portion of the Orontes basin since the agreement has been signed.Oregon State University: Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database, International Freshwater Treaties Database: Bilateral agreement, Act No. 15 concerning the division of the water of Al-Asi River (Orontes) between the Syrian Arab Republic and the Lebanese Republic, September 20, 1994, retrieved on February 5, 2010 There is apparently no such agreement over the Orontes between Syria and Turkey. However, in March 2008 Syria and Turkey reportedly agreed to jointly build a dam on the river, which suggests that some kind of agreement has been made. Yarmouk River. In 1987 Syria and Jordan signed an agreement about the sharing of the river's water and have subsequently built a dam, the Unity Dam, on the border between the two countries.  Groundwater  Historical groundwater recharge has been estimated at 4 km¬≥/year, out of which 2 km¬≥/year was estimated to discharge through springs into rivers (average 1977-2001).World Resources Institute:Water Resources and Freshwater Ecosystems-- Syrian Arab Republic, 2003, based on FAO Aquastat 2002 After deducting this \\"overlap\\" between surface water and groundwater net renewable groundwater resources were estimated at 2 km¬≥/year. Groundwater in Syria is heavily overexploited (see below).  Overall estimates  Estimates of water resources in Syria vary greatly, which is due to different assumptions about inflows from and outflows to other countries, different methodologies to account for overlaps between surface water and groundwater, and poor data. For example, one report estimates \\"internal\\" renewable water resources at 7.1 km¬≥/year (long-term average 1977-2001), taking into account overlaps between data between surface water and groundwater.FAO:FAO Water Report 43 (2009), accessed on October 31, 2009 However, UNDP estimates the renewable surface and groundwater resources at 10 km¬≥/year.The Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs/World Bank/United Nations Development Program: Strategy and National Environmental Action Plan for Syria, 2003, accessed on October 31, 2009 FAO estimates \\"total actual renewable water resources\\" at 16.8 km¬≥/year. The same report estimates \\"actual external renewable surface water resources\\" at 17.3 km¬≥/year, including 15.8 km¬≥ of water \\"entering\\" with the Euphrates, as unilaterally proposed by Turkey, 0.3 km¬≥ of water \\"entering\\" with the Asi- Orontes, as agreed with Lebanon, and 1.3 km¬≥/year from the Tigris. No specific estimates are provided for outflows of surface water to neighboring countries. If 58% of the flow of the Euphrates entering Syria (9.16 km¬≥/year) are considered Iraq's share as stipulated in the 1989 agreement, actual water resources available to Syria would be much lower than stated above. Finally, official data are questionable because better hydro-geological investigations of groundwater are needed to obtain more reliable data.Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (Germany) & Ministry of Irrigation (Syria). Initial Assessment Study of Water Sector Management in the Syrian Arab Republic, Final Report. Damascus, September 2004  Water use  Total annual water withdrawal was estimated at 19.4 km¬≥/year in 2008-2009, including 2.4 km¬≥/year taken by depleting groundwater and surface water reservoirs.Syria Today:Q&A;: Nader al-Bunni, Syrian Minister of Irrigation, by Francesca de Ch√¢tel, January 2010, accessed on January 18, 2010 It was estimated at 16.7 km¬≥/year in 2003, 88% of which was for agricultural purposes.FAO:FAO Aquastat Country Profile, 2008, accessed on October 31, 2009  Overexploitation of groundwater  In some basins, such as that of the Barada around Damascus, total water use exceeds availability of renewable water resources, resulting in overexploitation of groundwater. In the Mleita plain around the town of Al- Nabk in the Kalamoon Mountains north of Damascus, for example, the water table declined from 35 meter in 1984 to below 250 meter in 2009. Agriculture all but disappeared and the fertile valley was turned into a dusty wasteland.Syria Today:When Every Drop Counts, by Francesca de Ch√¢tel, January 2010, accessed on January 18, 2010 Other areas of heavy groundwater overexploitation are the area around Mhardeh in Hama Governorate, Khan Shaykhun in Idlib Governorate and the Damascus Ghouta where groundwater levels dropped by more than 6 meters per year in some areas between 1993 and 2000. Overexploitation of groundwater has contributed to a decline in the flow of the Khabur River which has ceased to flow during summer since 1999. The number of wells in Syria has been estimated to have increased from 135,089 in 1999 to over 213,335 in 2007, according to the National Agricultural Policy Centre (NAPC). The lands irrigated by groundwater increased from 652,000ha in 1985 to 1.4m ha in 2005. Rural electrification, diesel subsidies and subsidized loans for the drilling and equipment of wells contributed to the boom in groundwater irrigation.Syria Today:Mining the Deep, by Francesca de Ch√¢tel, January 2010, accessed on January 18, 2010  Water pollution  According to the Syrian National Environmental Action Plan of 2003, surface and groundwater are contaminated in many areas with domestic and industrial wastewater. For example, in the Barada River concentrations of biological oxygen demand (BOD) and ammonia exceeded Syrian Standards for 86% of collected samples between 1995 and 2000. Well and spring water in the basin is bacteriologically contaminated because of sewage discharge. The concentrations of nitrates in some wells in the Ghouta near Damascus exceeded the limits set by the drinking water standards. Because of discharges by tanneries concentrations of Chromium III reach 10 mg/liter in Al Daiyani River and exceed the allowable limits ten-fold in the wells of Al Zablatini area, all located in the Barada basin. On the Orontes River analyses of water samples for ammonia, suspended solids and BOD indicated that concentrations exceeded the allowable limits, particularly in the lower part of the river. In the upper part, water quality is acceptable. On the Quweiq River flowing through Aleppo concentrations of BOD, ammonia and heavy metals exceeded allowable limits. In the coastal region wells used for drinking purposes are contaminated with high concentrations of nitrates and ammonia because of sewage discharge and use of fertilizers. Water salinity is also high in some wells because of seawater intrusion into the fresh groundwater aquifers.  Dams  The Tabqa Dam, Syria's largest dam, and Lake Assad on the Euphrates from space, June 1996. North is at the top left of the image. There are 165 dams in Syria with a total storage capacity of 19.6 km¬≥. By far the largest dam is the Tabqa Dam, located near Raqqa on the Euphrates and forming Lake Assad. Its purpose is production of hydropower, irrigation and storage of water for drinking water for Aleppo. Medium-size dams include the Al-Rastan (0.2 km¬≥), the Lake Homs Dam (Qattinah) (0.2 km¬≥), the Mouhardeh (0.07 km¬≥) and the Taldo (0.02 km¬≥). In 2007 there were 49 dams on the Orontes River with a total storage capacity of 1.5 km¬≥, or more than three times the average annual flow of the river. There were 42 dams on the Yarmouk with a total storage capacity of 0.3 km¬≥. Twenty-one dams are located in the coastal area with a total storage capacity of 0.6 km¬≥. Legal and institutional framework A comprehensive regulatory framework for integrated water resources management does not exist in Syria. Over 140 laws dealing with water have been passed since 1924. Prohibitions on well drilling and groundwater pollution have been passed, but there are no clear mechanisms for their enforcement. The Syrian water sector is both highly centralized and fragmented between sector institutions that have overlapping functions and responsibilities. A Council of General Commission for Water Resource Management is in charge of integrating water policies between various Ministries. According to another source there is a Higher Water Committee, which is presided by the Vice Prime Minister for service affairs. According to a report on Syria's water resources, \\"one of the consequences of the fragmentation and lack of coordination within the water sector is that key water resource data are not exchanged between the different institutions, which in turn hampers effective policy making.\\" Ministries with responsibilities related to water resources management include: *The Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) is a key actor in water resource management. It is responsible for water resources management and for the provision of all irrigation water in the country, including sewage effluent. MOI is also in charge of controlling and monitoring water quality through the Water Safety Committee. *The Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MAAR) is responsible for the rational use of water for agricultural purposes, for minimizing water consumption and encouraging the use of modern irrigation techniques. *The Ministry of Local Administration and Environment (MLAE) is responsible for dealing with all main environmental issues. In addition, it has the task to plan and implement all governmental activities at regional level. MLAE is responsible for the protection of the environment by issuing the required standards and monitoring the quality of water for all uses. *The Ministry of Housing and Construction (MHC) is responsible for proposing, planning and executing the Government's programme in the field of water supply and sanitation. Through its 14 water and sanitation directorates (Establishments) it is also in charge of providing water supply and sanitation services.  Water resources assessment and planning  From 2002-2004 the Ministry of Irrigation, with the support of Dutch development cooperation, prepared an integrated water resources management plan for the coastal basins. The project included detailed water resources assessment studies, the analysis and selection of strategies and an action plan developed in consultation with various government stakeholders.DHV:Coastal Water Resources Management Project 2002-2004, presentation at the seminar on Dutch-Syrian water cooperation, November 22, 2004 From 2002 onwards a Water Resources Information Center in the Ministry of Irrigation has been established with the assistance of JICA.

He was present at the Blue House presidential compound, site of the assassination of President Park Chung-hee, when it took place on 26 October 1979. Biography Born on 27 February 1929 in Gimcheon, Jeong Seung-hwa joined the South Korean Army as a conscript in the 17th Regiment and fought at the Battle of Busan Perimeter. He later went to the Korea Military Academy and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 26th Infantry Regiment in 1950, where he later commanded in the early 1960s. He then commanded a Mechanized Brigade and an Infantry Division, before being appointed as Commander of II Corps in 1976. In 1978, Jeong was appointed Army Chief of Staff, the most dominant role in the South Korean military. On the evening of 26 October 1979, while Jeong was dining at the Blue House presidential compound, South Korean President Park Chung-hee was assassinated at another facility in the compound. The assassin, Kim Jae- gyu, immediately sought out Jeong with a view to having him take over the presidency. Instead, an emergency cabinet meeting was convened at which Choi Kyu-hah, the prime minister, was declared acting president with Jeong implementing martial law. He plotted to exclude political soldiers such as the Hanahoe, an influential group of South Korean military officers. The group later instigated the Coup d'√©tat of December Twelfth. As a result, key members of the Hanahoe, such as Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, arrested Jeong on suspicion of involvement in the assassination of Park. As a punishment, Jeong was reduced in rank to private and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1997, 17 years after the coup d'√©tat, Jeong was cleared of any involvement in the death of Park by the Seoul District Court. He was restored to his general officer rank and received pay that had been forfeited at the time of his sentencing. He died on 12 June 2002 in Seoul.

The lunate sulcus marks the transition between V1 and V2. The lunate sulcus lies further back in human brains but has a more forward location in chimpanzees. The evolutionary expansion of the frontal areas of the lunate sulcus would have caused a shift in the particular location of the fissure. It has been hypothesized that evolutionary pressures resulted in the human brain undergoing internal reorganization to develop the capability of human language. Furthermore, this reorganization must have been implemented during early maturity and is likely responsible for eidetic imagery in some adolescents. During early development, the neural connections in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal lobe rapidly expand to allow capability for human language, while visual memory capacity of human brain would become limited. Biological studies have demonstrated that the lunate sulcus is subject to white matter growth, and dental fossil and tomography studies have shown that the brain organization of Australopithecus africanus is pongid-like.  History  Comparison of the Affenspalte homologue, renamed the lunate sulcus by Sir Grafton Elliot Smith, in the primary visual cortex of chimpanzee versus human brains. The Affenspalte, or lunate sulcus, is marked by the red line. The lunate sulcus was first identified during the early 1900s in the human brain as a homologue of the Affenspalte, a major sulcus defining the primary visual cortex (V1) in apes and other monkey species, by anatomist and Egyptologist Sir Grafton Elliot Smith. Based on Smith‚Äôs observations from studying over 400 Egyptian and ape brains, he noticed that the sulcal patterns between humans and apes were very similar. His methodology involved mapping cortical areas via simple visual inspection of endocasts from mummies, as well as of fresh whole and sectioned brains. Paleoneurologists and scientists study endocasts in order to gather information about brain size and shape, as well as sulcal patterns resulting from pressure-induced impressions by the brain‚Äôs surface. Comparison of data gathered from endocasts and the brains of living hominoids allows scientists to study the evolution of the human brain, both anatomically and cognitively. Ultimately, Smith argued that the lunate sulcus was responsible for delineating the rostrolateral boundary of the V1 in both humans and non- human primates, and even pointed out the specific location of the lunate sulcus in chimpanzee versus human brains. Notably, Smith noticed that the position of the lunate sulcus was more posterior in human, especially those of European descent, as compared to monkey brains. Based on this observation, he was the first to hypothesize that the caudal shift of the lunate sulcus in Homo sapiens was due to the evolutionary rapid overgrowth of the cerebral cortex that is unique to human neurodevelopment. Smith‚Äôs observation that the caudal shift of the lunate sulcus could also be used as a predictor for determining both the evolutionary posterolateral shift of the occipital lobes/V1 and the corresponding expansion of the neighboring parietotemporo- occipital visual association cortices was supported by recent research. However, some scientists today disagree with Smith‚Äôs assertion that a lunate sulcus exists in humans, arguing that there is only an Affenspalte which is solely unique to apes. Specifically, in a high-resolution MRI study conducted by Allen et al. (2006), the researchers scanned and analyzed 220 human brains and found no sign of the lunate sulcus homologue. Based on this finding, they suggested that the claim asserting humans have a lunate sulcus homologue fails to account for and show appreciation of the extensive evolutionary reorganization of the visual cortex in humans.  Evolution  Analyzing variability in the location of gross anatomical landmarks, like sulci, is an accepted method for studying evolutionary hominin brain reorganization. Notably, the position of the lunate sulcus in the occipital lobe has been studied in humans, early hominin endocasts, apes, and other monkey species by researchers seeking to make inferences about the morphological evolution of brain regions associated with human visual versus cognitive behaviors. However, some scientists remain skeptical about whether the lunate sulcus is a valid and reliable indicator for studying volumetric changes in the V1 due to the inconsistencies of the sulcus‚Äô presence and lack of histological correspondence with cytoarchitectonic boundaries in hominoids. Despite this, previous allometry studies have suggested that the lunate sulcus shifts from a lateral-anterior to a medial-posterior position as brain size increases. Such shifts have been accredited with predicting whether the lunate sulcus will occur or not based on an increase or reduction in V1 volume, thus providing an explanation for inconsistencies in its presence and position in the occipital lobes. Moreover, a study conducted by de Sousa et al. (2010) compared the volumes of the V1 relative to the position of the lunate sulcus in three- dimensional reconstructed non-human hominoid brains in order to determine if an allometric relationship existed between V1 volume and lunate sulcus position. The researchers found that the position of the lunate sulcus does accurately predict V1 volume in apes, and that V1 volume in humans is smaller than would be expected based on our large brain size. Furthermore, other research suggests a more posteriorly positioned lunate sulcus from the early hominin fossil record. Based on all these findings, de Sousa et al. (2010) concluded V1 reduction began during early hominin evolution given the more lateral-anterior position of the lunate sulcus in human and other primate brains today.

Medd. Kong. Dan. Vid. Selsk. 52, 263 (2006). They are accelerated in particle accelerators to very high energies, typically in the MeV or GeV range and have sufficient energy and mass to penetrate solids on a straight line. In many solids swift heavy ions release sufficient energy to induce permanently modified cylindrical zones, so-called ion tracks. If the irradiation is carried out in an initially crystalline material, ion tracks consist of an amorphous cylinder. Ion tracks can be produced in many amorphizing materials, but not in pure metals, where the high electronic heat conductivity dissipates away the electronic heating before the ion track has time to form.  Mechanisms  Time evolution of a Molecular Dynamics simulation of a swift heavy ion track in crystalline quartz, producing a cylindrical amorphous track in the material. Image size 17 nm √ó 13 nm. The mechanisms by which ion tracks are produced are subject to some debate. They can in some sense considered to produce thermal spikes in the sense that they lead to strong lattice heating and a transient disordered atom zone. However, at least the initial stage of the damage might be better understood in terms of a Coulomb explosion mechanism. Regardless of what the heating mechanism is, it is well established that swift heavy ions typically produce a long cylindrical track of damage in insulators, which has been shown to be underdense in the middle at least in SiO2.  Applications  Swift heavy ion tracks have several established and potential practical applications. Ion tracks in polymers can be etched to form a nanometer-thin channel through a polymer foil, so called track etch membranes. These are in industrial use. Irradiation of polyimide resists have potential to be used as templates for nanowire growth. Tracks can also be used to sputter materials. They can also be used to elongate nanocrystals embedded in materials.

The significance of her works proves M. Luk≈°ienƒó to be a scholar of European orientation and global level; a personality, who has significantly contributed to the development of democratic society and modern education and in 2007 she was given an Honourable award by the Ministry of Education and Science. Meilƒó Luk≈°ienƒó was the first in Lithuania to scientifically base the methodology of democratic education based both on historical and the contemporary development aspects. Her scientific creations are characterised by the integral humanitarian and social sciences principle, which continues its immense impact on the education theory science development. The scholar related the development of Lithuanian pedagogical thought with the general issues of the national culture. Thus her investigations were distinguished for their culturology aspects and extensive viewpoint. Her scientific works were conducted on the verge of three fields of science ‚Äì pedagogy, literature and culturology, and surpassed the prevailing investigations of those times, concentrated on the narrow specific issues of school system, didactics. Meilƒó Luk≈°ienƒó raised essential questions of the orientation of the Lithuanian education system, namely: ratio of nationality and universality; education of cultural identity; continuation of the cultural tradition and modernization of education; social justice. Then she formulated the ideal of education, which served as basis for the new content of education at school: a person who is moral, active citizen, independent thinker, creative and able to intake a variety of cultural values and act in a constructive way. The public discussions of these topics turned into an important factor of the change of pedagogic mentality and the overall mentality of the society. A valuable trait of M. Luk≈°ienƒó was her ability to get and embrace the newest information from a variety of sources, analyse the Western Europe education systems and the tendencies of their development, the newest ideas of education science, and to foresee the ways of their application in Lithuanian context. Meilƒó Luk≈°ienƒó was able to communicate, to read in several languages ‚Äì the Lithuanian, Polish, French, Russian, and German, thus was non-formally, intensively learning from a variety of sources of literature worldwide. Meilƒó Luk≈°ienƒó had a characteristic deep systems- oriented thinking. In all investigations conducted she considered the independent education system to be among the guarantees of statehood, while the presence of direction, purpose and capacity to embrace all possible layers of the society by the education system ‚Äì one of the conditions for successful existence of the state. Meilƒó Luk≈°ienƒó merited a lot as during the restoration of Lithuanian independence in year 1990 Lithuanian education met already having a conceptual Europe-orientated future education model. It was used as a basis to create the General Concept of Education in Lithuania (1992), which delineated the directions of the national education system development. The essential education principles chosen were humanism, democracy, national identity and renewal. The theoretical basis for education development the humanistic education paradigm, the holistic education concept was chosen. The education system was based on European culture values ‚Äì personal worth, natural equality of people, freedom of consciousness, tolerance, democratic relations within society. The education was titled as the basic factor of the society development, the fundament of all social reforms, thus a task was formulated to overtake the general development of the society and be its leader. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) experts in year 1999 assessed the Lithuanian education and admitted that in Lithuania does exist a solid conceptual basis for reforms (‚ÄúThere is a strong conceptual foundation for reforms‚Äù) and Lithuania presents the best example of the major document ‚Äì the General Concept of Education in Lithuania of 1992 ‚Äì its creation and development. The main author of these works is Dr. Hab. Meilƒó Luk≈°ienƒó. In her public and educational activities Meilƒó Luk≈°ienƒó always was distinctive by her faith that a person has capacity to change oneself and his/her social cultural environment towards humanism. By her overall activities she modelled not only education, but also the future of the state ‚Äì a modern Lithuanian nation, open society, democratic state. She considered the education of a competent person for a democratic state to be among the major goals of education.

The approach of M. Luk≈°ienƒó is in special resound with European and global orientation of education of the 21st century and the goals of educational systems. The significance of her works proves M. Luk≈°ienƒó to be a scholar of European orientation and global level; a personality, who has significantly contributed to the development of democratic society and modern education. 100th anniversary of the birth of Meilƒó Luk≈°ienƒó, professor and social scientist (1913-2009) is celebrated by UNESCO.

In the classical era, monstrous creatures such as the cyclops and the Minotaur appear in heroic tales for the protagonist to destroy. Other creatures, such as the unicorn, were claimed in accounts of natural history by various scholars of antiquity. Some legendary creatures have their origin in traditional mythology and were believed to be real creatures, for example dragons, griffins, and unicorns. Others were based on real encounters, originating in garbled accounts of travelers' tales, such as the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary, which supposedly grew tethered to the earth. Creatures In classical mythology, the Minotaur was defeated by the hero Theseus. bestiaries included mythical animals like the monoceros (above) alongside real animals like the bear. A variety of mythical animals appear in the art and stories of the Classical era. For example, in the Odyssey, monstrous creatures include the Cyclops, Scylla and Charybdis for the hero Odysseus to confront. In other tales there appear the Medusa to be defeated by Perseus, the (human/bull) Minotaur to be destroyed by Theseus, and the Hydra to be killed by Heracles, while Aeneas battles with the harpies. These monsters thus have the basic function of emphasizing the greatness of the heroes involved.Grimal, Pierre. The Dictionary of Classical Mythology. Blackwell Reference, 1986.Sabin, Frances E. Classical Myths That Live Today. Silver Burdett Company, 1940. Some classical era creatures, such as the (horse/human) centaur, chimaera, Triton and the flying horse, are found also in Indian art. Similarly, sphinxes appear as winged lions in Indian art and the Piasa Bird of North America. In medieval art, animals, both real and mythical, played important roles. These included decorative forms as in medieval jewellery, sometimes with their limbs intricately interlaced. Animal forms were used to add humor or majesty to objects. In Christian art, animals carried symbolic meanings, where for example the lamb symbolized Christ, a dove indicated the Holy Spirit, and the classical griffin represented a guardian of the dead. Medieval bestiaries included animals regardless of biological reality; the basilisk represented the devil, while the manticore symbolised temptation. Allegory Symbolic power: a dragon in the Imperial City, Hu·∫ø, Vietnam One function of mythical animals in the Middle Ages was allegory. Unicorns, for example, were described as extraordinarily swift and uncatchable by traditional methods.Gravestock, Pamela. \\"Did Imaginary Animals Exist?\\" In The Mark of the Beast: The Medieval Bestiary in Art, Life, and Literature. New York: Garland. 1999. It was believed that the only way for one to catch this beast was to lead a virgin to its dwelling. Then, the unicorn was supposed to leap into her lap and go to sleep, at which point a hunter could finally capture it. In terms of symbolism, the unicorn was a metaphor for Christ. Unicorns represented the idea of innocence and purity. In the King James Bible, Psalm 92:10 states, \\"My horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn.\\" This is because the translators of the King James erroneously translated the Hebrew word re'em as unicorn. Later versions translate this as wild ox.J. L. Schrader. The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series, Vol. 44, No. 1, \\"A Medieval Bestiary\\" (Summer, 1986), pp. 1+12‚Äì55, 17. The unicorn's small size signifies the humility of Christ. Another common legendary creature which served allegorical functions within the Middle Ages was the dragon. Dragons were identified with serpents, though their attributes were greatly intensified. The dragon was supposed to have been larger than all other animals. It was believed that the dragon had no harmful poison but was able to slay anything it embraced without any need for venom. Biblical scriptures speak of the dragon in reference to the devil, and they were used to denote sin in general during the Middle Ages. Dragons were said to have dwelled in places like Ethiopia and India, based on the idea that there was always heat present in these locations. Physical detail was not the central focus of the artists depicting such animals, and medieval bestiaries were not conceived as biological categorizations. Creatures like the unicorn and griffin were not categorized in a separate \\"mythological\\" section in medieval bestiaries,Flores, Nona C., \\"The Mirror of Nature Distorted: The Medieval Artist's Dilemma in Depicting Animals\\". In The Medieval World of Nature. New York: Garland. 1993. as the symbolic implications were of primary importance. Animals we know to have existed were still presented with a fantastical approach. It seems the religious and moral implications of animals were far more significant than matching a physical likeness in these renderings. Nona C. Flores explains, \\"By the tenth century, artists were increasingly bound by allegorical interpretation, and abandoned naturalistic depictions.\\" See also * Lists of legendary creatures * List of legendary creatures by type * Fearsome critters References External links Category:Mythological archetypes ","title":"Legendary creature"},{"id":"24921398","text":"Stuntman is the fifth solo album released by Tangerine Dream leader Edgar Froese, in 1979.

It is situated on the B6355 road between Duns and Eyemouth in the old county of Berwickshire, now part of the Scottish Borders, at . The town of Chirnside is east of Duns, and north-west of Berwick-upon-Tweed.  History  The first records of Chirnside and its church came in the early 12th century during the reign of King Edgar of Scotland (1097-1107), in a charter granting the lands and church to the monks of Durham. The 12th-century church was known as Ecclesia de Chirnyside and it was valued at 50 merks. The first church at Chirnside was a plain rectangular building with a thatched roof and earthen floor. The altar dominated the east end and a priest would conduct daily mass, probably from a pulpit near the altar. The Ecclesia de Chirnyside was dedicated, like many other church establishments in the area, by David de Bernham, Bishop of St Andrews, on 13 April 1242. In 1524 a young man named Luke Acheson, who lived in the village, was keeping watch from the tower of the church, and was killed by six English freebooters.  Post Reformation  It would appear the old church was badly damaged at the Reformation as the body of the church was extensively repaired in 1573, and the first minister of the new reformed faith was not installed until that year (see list of early ministers). In 1581, during the reign of King James VI of Scotland, the church was mentioned in a national list of Presbyteries. There was further extensive renewal in 1757, and a new manse was built for the minister. A wall on the western tower was retained in the renovations, with an engraved plate declaring \\"Helpe the pyr\\" (Help the poor) and the date 1573. A Norman archway was retained from the 12th-century church. Tweedmouth Memorial Gateway In 1904, following the death of Lady Tweedmouth and her burial at the west end of the church, her husband, Edward Marjoribanks, 2nd Baron Tweedmouth completely reshaped the interior of the church. He built a hall, a new vestry and added a new tower. Following the Baron's death, his son erected a memorial gateway in memory of his father. The already united churches of Free Church and United Free Church, joined the Church of Scotland kirk in 1929. The North Church closed in 1973 but reopened in 1984 as a community centre. The United Presbyterian Church of Scotland building was demolished in 1982. Chirnside Parish Church is a category B listed building. World Champion Formula One driver Jim Clark (1936-1968) was buried in Chirnside Kirkyard, after his death in April 1968 at the Hockenheimring in Germany.

He was first ordained a Roman Catholic priest on June 3, 1944, and enrolled in the Fu Jen Catholic University in Beijing just three months later. He graduated from the University in 1948. Lin returned to the Diocese of Ningbo, where he worked as the principal of a diocesan Catholic school until 1955. Bishop Andre-Jean-Francois Defebvre of Ningbo named Lin one of the diocese's administrators during the 1950s. He was arrested by the Communist Chinese government in 1955 and sentenced to sixteen years of hard labor for \\"counter-revolutionary crimes.\\" He returned to his work as a Catholic priest following his release from prison in 1971.

Family Gryfina was the daughter of Rostislav Mikhailovich (1225‚Äì1262), Prince of Halych, and his wife Anna of Hungary (1226‚Äìc. 1270), daughter of B√©la IV of Hungary. After losing the throne of Halych, Rostislav fled to Hungary and was received at the court of his father-in-law, King B√©la IV. Rostislav was later granted the administration of Slavonia, one of the most important regions of the Hungarian Medieval Kingdom. Gryfina was born in Hungary, where she was raised with her sisters. One of her sisters was Kunigunda, who married Ottakar II of Bohemia and was the mother of Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. Marriage In 1265, at the age of seventeen, Gryfina was married to Leszek, son of Casimir I of Kuyavia. RUSSIAN RURIKID, Medieval LandsOswald Balzer, Genealogia Piast, Krak√≥w 2005, p. 582 The wedding was organized by Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste. Between 1271 and 1274 the spouses separated, Gryfina having publicly accused her husband of impotency. Leszek sought treatment, but the marriage remained childless. After four years, Boles≈Çaw V forced a reconciliation between the spouses. During the revolt against her husband in 1285, Gryfina took refuge in Wawel under the care of the citizens. During the third Tatar raid of 1287 she escaped with her husband to Hungary, where many of her family members lived. Widowhood After the death of her husband in 1288, Gryfina's nephew Wenceslaus II of Bohemia claimed Poland on the basis of his aunt's marriage. Gryfina retired to the monastery of the Poor Clares in Stary SƒÖcz. The prioress there was her mother's sister, Kinga, the widow of Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste. After Kinga's death, Gryfina became abbess.

The hill is well-known, especially as the site of the Emperor William Monument (Kaiser Wilhelm Denkmal), but also for the Moltke Tower and Wittekind Castle.  Geography  The Wittekindsberg rises at the eastern end of the Wiehen Hills im Minden-L√ºbbecke district directly northwest of the village of Barkhausen within the borough of Porta Westfalica, and about 6 km south-southwest of the town of Minden. It is located due west of the Porta Westfalica gorge (the \\"Westphalian Gate\\"), that lies on the northern edge of the Weser Uplands and the southern border of the North German Plain and through which the River Weser flows from the uplands northwards into the plain. To the east is the Jakobsberg (238 m), which is the westernmost hill of the Wesergebirge and the eastern guardian overlooking the gorge. The Wittekindsberg is surrounded by the eastern areas of the North Teutoburg Forest-Wiehen Hills Nature Park that extends from just in front of B√ºckeburg into the Wesergebirge.  Emperor William Monument  On the east slopes of the Wittekindsberg, at a height of about 210 m, is the Emperor William Monument, built in 1896 in honour of the emperor, William I. It is a popular destination because it has good views over some of the surrounding hills, the Porta Westfalica and the southern part of the North German Plain.  Moltke Tower  About 1 km (as the crow flies) west of the Emperor William Monument on the highest point of the Wittekindsberg () is the Moltke Tower, built in 1828/29 as the Wittekindsstein observation tower and, in 1906, was renamed the Moltke Tower in honour of Field Marshal Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke (1800 to 1891). From its observation deck at a height of 13.9 m, there are views of the surrounding hill country as well as the Weser Depression and the southern fringes of the North German Plain.  Wittekind Castle  Around 450 m due west of the Moltke Tower at about is Wittekind Castle, a former refuge castle with its nearby Wittekind well, now dried up. In 1996, within the Iron Age and Early Medieval refuge castle the foundations of the Church of the Cross (Kreuzkirche) were discovered which, thanks to conservation measures, are now open to the general public. Near the foundations is the Chapel of St. Margaret (Margarethenkapelle) from the 12th century. An inn (built in 1896/96) attracts hikers and walkers in good weather.  Transport links  Near the Wittekindsberg the B 61, B 65 and B 482 federal roads cross one another. These provide links to the A 2 and A 30 motorways not far to the south as well as side roads that lead to the hill. In addition the Wittekindesberg is linked to the Deutsche Bahn railway network by Porta station, which is part of Porta Westfalica and situated at the western foot of the Jakobsberg on the east bank of the Weser. The Wittekindsberg is covered by a good network of walking trails, including the European long-distance path E11 from which the points of interest on the hill may be reached.

Its generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek word nephel√™ \\"mist\\", referring to the cloud forest habitat of the members of the genus. The species in this genus have historically been placed in Oryzomys, but in 2006, Brazilian zoologist Marcelo Weksler and coworkers described it as a separate genus, because it is not closely related to the type species of Oryzomys.Weksler, 2006 They are most closely related to other members of clade B, including Euryoryzomys, Transandinomys, Hylaeamys, Oecomys, and Handleyomys, with some weak evidence supporting a sister-group relationship to Transandinomys.Weksler et al., 2006, p. 20 Oryzomys appears in a different part of the oryzomyine evolutionary radiation, perhaps close to Holochilus and related genera. Nephelomys species have yellowish- to reddish-brown upperparts, and they are variable in the coloration of the underparts, with some possessing light, nearly white, fur, which is separated from the color of the upperparts by an abrupt change in color, but others having ochraceous coloring which changes more gradually from the coloring on the back. Small patches of pure white fur may also be present on the underparts in some species. The ears are small, but the tail is long, and it is bicolored to a smaller or greater extent, depending on the species. Several pads are prominently present.Weksler et al., 2006, pp. 18‚Äì19 Weksler and coworkers provided detailed comparisons among Euryoryzomys, Hylaeamys, Nephelomys, and Transandinomys. Among those genera, Nephelomys is unique in its short ears; in the relatively long claw on the fifth digit of the hindfoot; and in that the anterocone, the major cusp located at the front of the upper first molar, is divided into two smaller cusps.Weksler et al., 2006, table 3 The divided anterocone appears to be a synapomorphy of the genus.Weksler et al., 2006, p. 21 Additionally, Nephelomys species are larger than those in Transandinomys and they have additional roots on the lower first molar that Transandinomys species lack. In 1961, all current Nephelomys species were classified under the single species Oryzomys albigularis, but subsequently, the distinctiveness of various others was recognized.Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1145 In 2005, seven species were listed under the O. albigularis group.Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1144 When Nephelomys was described as a separate species in 2006, six former synonyms were accorded specific status, so that a total of thirteen species are now recognized as valid.Weksler et al., 2006, p. 18 References Literature cited *Bangs, O. 1902.

Initially raised in 1921 as the 1st Cavalry Brigade in Queensland, it was a part time formation of the Militia. It consisted of three light horse regiments spread across several depots in the southeast part of the state. During World War II, the brigade was mobilised for defensive duties in December 1941, and assumed positions north of Brisbane to defend against a possible invasion. In early 1942, the brigade was converted into a motorised formation, and was redesignated as the 1st Motor Brigade. In July 1943, when the threat of invasion had passed, it was disbanded and its manpower reallocated to operational formations. History The brigade was formed as a part time unit of the Militia in 1921 and was designated as the 1st Cavalry Brigade. Headquartered in Brisbane, Queensland, the brigade was raised from the previously existing 1st Light Horse Brigade. Upon establishment, the brigade consisted of three light horse regiments: the 5th, 11th and 14th. These were based in Gympie, Toowoomba and Ipswich. It formed part of the 1st Cavalry Division, which was headquartered in Sydney. By 1938, the brigade's three regiments had been transferred to the 11th Mixed Brigade, with the 2nd and 14th Light Horse Regiments being amalgamated. Plans drawn up before the war assigned the brigade a flank protection role to the north and south of Brisbane in the event of an invasion. During World War II, the 1st Cavalry Brigade was mobilised for full time service following Japan's entry into the war in December 1941. At this time, the brigade's headquarters was located at Fortitude Valley, Queensland; its constituent units were converted into motorised units at this time, as part of an effort to motorise or mechanise Australia's mounted forces in the early war years. The brigade consisted of the 5th Motor Regiment, the 11th Motor Regiment and the 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion at this time, and was spread between Gympie, Gatton, and Grovely. By February 1942, the brigade's headquarters had moved to Enoggera with the 5th and 11th Motor Regiments based around Buderim and Caloundra. The brigade was converted into the 1st Motor Brigade in March ‚Äì April 1942. After it was converted into a motor brigade, the brigade was reinforced by the 16th Motor Regiment, which was transferred to Gympie from New South Wales. At this time, the brigade was tasked with carrying out reconnaissance and defensive duties in the Bundaberg‚ÄìMaroochy River region, in the event of a Japanese invasion. This resulted in brigade headquarters being moved to Cooroy and then Gympie in April and May. The brigade was assigned to the 5th Division, then transferred to the direct command of I Corps before later being transferred to the 1st Motor Division. In July 1942, the brigade's area of responsibility was widened to include Maryborough as part of a reorganisation necessitated by the dispatch of the 7th Division to New Guinea to join the fighting along the Kokoda Track. The brigade was transferred again in November 1942, to the 3rd Armoured Division, headquartered at Murgon; at this time, the brigade's main units were the 5th, 11th and 16th Motor Regiments. At the start of 1943, the 1st Motor Brigade moved to Goomeri. However, when the threat of invasion had passed, the brigade was disbanded in July 1943, having not seen any active service. The brigade's manpower was then reallocated to meet shortages in the Army's operational formations, with the volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force personnel being reassigned to several different infantry brigades, specifically the 18th and 21st, while headquarters staff were transferred to the 25th Infantry Brigade's headquarters.

Since then Wehrkamp has been a composer, as well as performing guitars, keyboards and vocals in the band. He also manages the day-to-day affairs for Shadow Gallery through their publishing company, ROOM V MUSIC. Shadow Gallery has released seven albums worldwide through Magna Carta Records (until 2003) and Inside Out. The band has been noted as one of the most important and innovative progressive metal bands to come out in the last decade. ‚ÄúShadow Gallery is a band with an extremely loyal fanbase, an irrefutable integrity, and a unique sound that will doubtlessly guarantee its continued existence for years to come.‚Äù =Other projects= Wehrkamp has been a musician, composer, producer, or engineer on over fifty albums throughout the past three decades. Some of these most notable projects are: Wehrkamp wrote an original score for the Steve Coombs film, A Walk in the Park, which premiered in NYC on June 11, 2001. The same year, Wehrkamp was involved in a project called Sounds like Christmas, that featured artists such as John Wetton (King Crimson), Steve Walsh (Kansas), and Trent Gardner (Magellan). Wehrkamp has been a guest keyboardist or guitarist on three Arjen Lucassen albums: Ayreon - Flight of the Migrator (2000), Ayreon - Ayreonauts Only (2000), Star One - Space Metal (2002). He also provided his engineer skills for the Ayreon Human Equation album (2004). ‚ÄúBecause I thought he was funny I decided to allow him to play a solo on 'Flight of the Migrator'. The joke was on me then... it was one of the best solos I had ever heard; a combination of playfulness (Steve Vai), virtuosity (Edward van Halen) and speed (Yngwie Malmsteen) and still with a completely recognizable own sound. It goes without saying that I worked with Gary again on the Star One album 'Space Metal', especially because he had to play a duel with the fastest keyboard player of the world Jens Johansson (the outcome is undecided). That solo is the reason I never dared play the song 'Master of Darkness' live...‚Äù ‚Äì Arjen Lucassen During his past and present tenures with Lucassen he has received the rather affectionate nickname of \\"Garyeon\\". In 2002, Wehrkamp was a guest guitarist on Explorers Club‚Äôs second release Raising the Mammoth, which also included other prog artists such as John Myung (Dream Theater) and Terry Bozzio. In 2005, Wehrkamp was involved in Prog-Aid, a charity release by various artists from the Progressive Rock world to raise funds for the survivors of the Asian tsunami disaster. In 2007, Wehrkamp joined a super group of musicians (Kurt Barabas, Nick D'Virgilio and D.C. Cooper) under the name Amaran's Plight to create the album Voice in the Light. The concept of the album is a look at one man‚Äôs search for answers following a near death experience. Along with providing the guitar and keyboard work on the album, Wehrkamp also acted as composer, producer and recording engineer for this album. The album made various Top 2007 album lists, including #3 on the online site USA Progressive Music and staff top 2007 picks on the Sea of Tranquility website. In 2008, Wehrkamp was a guest musician on Srdjan Brankovic‚Äôs Expedition Delta music project. That same year along with progressive music publicist Jill Hughes, and Pocono-area businessman Brian Schmidt and musician Kristi Bronico, Wehrkamp formed the charity group The Wishmakers whose slogan is, ‚ÄúMusicians making a difference...harnessing the power of music and art to foster the spirit of giving.‚Äù He produced the single ‚ÄúChristmastime in the Poconos‚Äù which successfully raised money for the Christmas Fund for local children in need. In 2009, Wehrkamp was a guest guitarist on the album based on International bestselling author Kevin J. Anderson‚Äôs book Terra Incognita: Beyond the Horizon, under the band name Roswell Six. It also featured other guest musicians such as John Payne (Asia), Erik Norlander (Asia Featuring, Rocket Scientists), and Lana Lane. Along with the other Shadow Gallery band members, Wehrkamp has been involved in various tribute albums for Rush, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, etc. Wehrkamp currently performs live on bass, guitar, keyboards and vocals with Pocono-area cover bands JR Trio, fronted by Jim Roberti, and The Maybabies. These bands have played regularly over 100 shows per year over the past decade, performing at venues such as Highline Ballroom, Central Park Boathouse, The Red Lion, The Players Club, The Ritz-Carlton, The Waldorf-Astoria (NYC), and Giants Stadium Tailgate events (East Rutherford, NJ). ‚ÄúWith more than 8,000 collective shows between them, the MAYBABIES have all the experience to deliver a professional and entertaining show where their evolving set-list includes music from all eras, suitable for the crowd in front of them.‚Äù Alan Verone, MayBabies Bio, 2007 He also is one of the owners of Wasabi Brothers Management, which books artists and sets up publishing and licensing contracts for clients. In March, 2014 US Epic Metal legends Warload announced that Wehrkamp will be taking the place of Philip Bynoe as Bassist for their 2014 European tour. Influences Wehrkamp notes that his personal music influences are Pink Floyd, Rush, Yes, Kansas, Van Halen, and Queen. He also draws inspiration from guitar virtuosos such as Yngwie Malmsteen, Eddie Van Halen, Chris Alia and Steve Vai. Personal life Wehrkamp currently lives in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania with his wife and son. He owns New Horizon Music Studios, where he works as a producer, studio musician, engineer and teacher (drums, bass, guitar and piano and recording concepts). Tragedy On November 29, 2015, the Wehrkamp family home, along with Gary's recording studio and equipment, was destroyed by a fire. The following day, Shadow Gallery shared a link to their official Facebook page urging fans of the band to donate money to nonprofit organization Mady's Angels in support for the family's recovery. On December 26, benefit concert was held at Sherman Theater, hosted by benefit group the Wishmakers. As of a March 2, 2016 post, the family has been on a path to recovery.

Washington was built in California and was initially operated on the Sacramento River. In 1851, the steamer was purchased and brought on a ship to the Oregon Territory, where it was operated on the Willamette River until the summer of 1853. Washington was sold again, and then transferred to the Oregon coast, where it operated on the Umpqua River, on the Coquille River and on Coos Bay. Washington was able to operate for shorter distances over the open ocean along the Oregon coast. The steamer was wrecked by a boiler explosion in December 1857, near Scottsburg, O.T., on the Umpqua river. Design Washington had an iron hull and driven by twin propellers. It was capable of operating with a single propeller if one was damaged. Washington was 40 feet long with a beam of 8 feet and a depth of hold of 4 feet. Overall size of the Washington was 20 tons. It was manufactured in Philadelphia and shipped out to the west coast of the United States. Propeller-driven vessels operated at a disadvantage on the Willamette. Sidewheel steamers did better in shallow water, as was often encountered on the upper Willamette and its navigable tributaries. Propellers had to be submerged to furnish power, and there was always the potential in low water of striking obstruction on the river bottom, which happened to the Washington at least once, in September 1851, on the lower Willamette river. This was less of a danger to the side- wheelers.  Operations in California  Washington first operated in California on the Sacramento River. There the Washington was the first steamboat to ascend the Sacramento River from Sacramento to the mouth of the Feather River. She subsequently made regular trips to the landing there called Vernon.Memorial And Biographical History Of Northern California: Containing a History of this Important Section of the Pacific Coast from the Earliest Period of Its Occupancy to the Present Time, Lewis Publishing Company, Chicago, 1891 Pioneer steamboat captain Alexander Sinclair Murray (1827-1914) bought the boat in 1851, and had it transported to Oregon on board the bark Success. Although an oceangoing vessel, Success was able to proceed up to Oregon City in June, 1851, covering, it was claimed, most of the distance on the river under sail. On June 5, 1851, the bark Success was reported to have arrived in the Columbia river, carrying two river boats, one a steamboat, and the other a propeller.  Willamette River service  Operations on the upper Willamette In early June 1851, Murray and some others investigated whether a small steamboat could be operated on the Tualatin river. Murray had Washington launched above Willamette Falls at Canemah and worked on the Willamette River to the Yamhill River. It was hoped that Washington could go as far up the Willamette as Corvallis, then known as Marysville. Washington 's first run up the Yamhill was on June 6, 1851. Washington remained this route for a time, seeking cargoes from the nearby wheat farms. With Washington in service, there were now two steamboats running on the Willamette river above the falls. Three steamboats were running below. Two years previously there had been no steamers at all on the Willamette. The main competition at this time against Washington was another propeller-driven steamer, the Hoosier. Washington was advertised as running from Canemah to Champoeg, where the boat would meet a connecting stage coach line for travellers bound for Salem, Oregon. On June 19, 1851, Captain Murray was reported to have \\"arrived with his iron, steam propeller\\" apparently the Washington. Murray was reported to be confident of navigating to Salem at any time of the year. The arrival of the new steamer was praised by the editor of the Oregon City weekly newspaper, Oregon Spectator as a sign of progress. On the morning of Thursday, June 26, 1851, Washington, with Capt. Murray in command, departed Oregon City on what was intend to be a run south to Corvallis, then known as Marysville. As of June 26, 1851 in addition to the two operating boats on the upper Willamette, the Hoosier and the newly arrived Washington, there was another belonging to Captain Bissel, which was expected to be compete in four or five weeks. The firm of Hedges & Barlow were building a new sidewheeler, the Canemah, which they expected to have running sometime in September. On its first trip, Washington went up the Yamhill River to Dayton, where the boat's crew was well received. Washington remained at Dayton overnight, leaving the next morning for Salem, where they arrived at about 4:00 p.m on Friday, June 27. Washington was also welcomed at Salem, where the citizens fired off a saluting cannon, and made firewood and other supplies available to the steamer free of charge. After about two hours at Salem, Washington proceeded further upstream to Cincinnati Landing, now known as Eola, where the boat was greeted by the proprietor of the place, A.C.R. Shaw. Cincinnati was a small landing 3 miles west of Salem, in Polk County, 200 yards up Rickreall Creek, which was then known as the La Creole River. Washington under Captain Murray was the first steamboat to reach Eola. Advertisement for the steamer Washington, placed in the Oregon Spectator, July 22, 1851. To facilitate steamboat service, the citizens of Cincinnati Landing went to the extent of digging a canal from the Willamette to the La Creole River. Washington was reported to have negotiated the canal without difficulty. Low water problems Murray had placed Washington into regular service on the river on July 3, 1851. In early July 1851, the river below the falls went down about 3.5 feet. While navigation was reported to be unimpeded, there was just 18 inches of water on the bars above the falls. Washington scrapped bottom in several places downriver from Salem, while the Hoosier was able to continue regular trips to Dayton. The upper river proved to be too shallow for Washington, and freight could be found elsewhere for the vessel. Transfer to lower Willamette In early August 1851, Washington was hauled around the falls to the lower Willamette river. The river at that time was said to be unusually low, but still 10 or 15 inches above extreme low water. The withdrawal of Washington left the Hoosier, for a time, as the only steamboat running on the upper Willamette. On the lower Willamette Washington ran between Portland, Oregon, and Oregon City, joining a small flotilla of steamboats which included Eagle, Blackhawk, Major Redding, Allan and Columbia. Washington was the largest of the vessels running on the lower river at that time. With very few people living in either Portland and Oregon City, competition was fierce. As of November 18, 1851, Washington was running regularly between Oregon City and Portland, carrying \\"large quantities\\" of freight to the landing at Oregon City below the falls, to be portaged there and then shipped to points on the upper river. Service above the falls as far as Marysville was then conducted by two sternwheelers, Canemah and Multnomah, each making one trip a week. For a stretch of several days in mid-February, 1852, all steamboat service between Oregon City and Portland was suspended when both Washington and another iron-hulled propeller, the Eagle were taken off the route, apparently as a result of mechanical breakdowns. Return to upper Willamette In spring 1853, Washington was taken back above the falls, back to the upper Willamette river, where it was operated only a few months, until July1853. Murray replaced Washington with a new wooden sidewheeler, the Portland. Sale to coastal interests In July 1853, Washington was purchased for use on the Umpqua river by Allan, McKinlay & Co., an Oregon City concern which had a branch operation on the Umpqua. Pioneer steamboat man William H. Troup (1828‚Äì1882), the father of steamboat captains James and Claud Troup, went with Washington as the vessel's engineer. Washington, then owned by Allan, McKinlay & Co, was rigged in schooner fashion for the voyage to the Umpqua. In mid-August 1853, Washington departed Oregon City for the Umpqua, where, if it arrived safely, it was to be used as a tow boat. No similar vessel was then in operation on that river. On August 26, 1853, it was reported in Oregon City that Washington had arrived safely and undamaged at Scottsburg, despite having encountered some heavy weather on the way.  Umpqua River service  Advertisement for steamer Washington service on the Umpqua river, 1854 The head of navigation on the Umpqua River was a former Hudson's Bay Company outpost, called Scottsburg, O.T., In the mid-1850s, Scottsburg was the center of business and transport activity in southwestern Oregon. The population in this area was increasing due to incoming settlers and mining activity. As of April 28, 1854, Washington made tri-weekly trips between Scottsburg and the mouth of the Umpqua River, departing from Allan, McKinlay & Company's wharf at Scottsburg on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The company's owners advertised that \\"a good scow for the transportation of cattle is always in readiness.\\" One of Washington's owners was Capt. Sylvester Hinsdale (1824‚Äì1870), a former seaman and a merchant at Gardiner, Oregon, on the Umpqua River. On November 11, 1854, Washington was placed on a winter schedule, running, under Capt. J.U. Harris from the Allan, McKinlay & Co. wharf in lower Scottsburf every Saturday evening, carrying the U.S. mails, to Gardiner, Providence, Winchester Bay (then known as Umpqua City), and Pyramid Rock. Washington returned to Scottsburg on Sunday morning, departing from Umpqua City at 8:00 a.m. The boat was advertised as being ready to \\"meet vessels at all other times, and receive freight and passengers for every point within the bounds of navigation on the Umpqua river. Washington was still running on the winter schedule on February 24, 1855. Operations on the Coos and Coquille rivers William H. Troup, engineer on the Washington Washington was operated on Coos Bay, again with Wm. H. Troup as engineer, and for a short time on the Coquille River. Washington also ran on the open ocean in addition to riverine service. On August 19, 1853, Washington departed Scottsburg, bound for Coos Bay. Washington reached Umpqua City, now known as Winchester Bay, near the mouth of the river that same day. The next day, Saturday, August 19, Washington tried to cross the bar of the Umpqua, but the weather was too rough. The next day however, Sunday, August 20, Washington was able to cross the bar and, despite bad weather during the voyage, reached and crossed the Coos Bay bar, and landed at the then newly founded town of Oregon. Washington was able to use coal from the Coos Bay coal fields rather than wood as fuel for the boiler.  Boiler explosion  Washington's career terminated with a boiler explosion in December 1857. About noon on Saturday, December 12, 1857, the boiler exploded on Washington, scalding five persons who were on board. The extent of the injuries was not known at the time of the first report. The boat was reported to have been left \\"a total wreck. The incident occurred just downriver from Scottsburg.

The film follows Dane and Lucas Thompson, two brothers who move into their new house in Bensenville with their single mother, Susan. While settling in their new home, Dane and Lucas, along with their new neighbor, Julie Campbell, discover a trap door in the basement, leading to a bottomless pit and, upon opening it, accidentally unleash a supernatural force that manifests itself into any fear of the person who looks into the titular hole. Plot 17-year-old Dane Thompson, his 10-year-old brother, Lucas, and their mother, Susan, move from Brooklyn to the quiet town of Bensenville where Dane and Lucas befriend their next door neighbor, Julie Campbell. While exploring their new home, Dane and Lucas discover a trapdoor with several locks along each side in the basement. Opening the trapdoor reveals a hole which appears to be bottomless. Over the next few days, each child experiences strange events. Lucas, having a fear of clowns, discovers a jester puppet on his bed, as well as other locations, as if it is following him. Julie begins to see an injured girl who bleeds from her eyes. Dane starts to see shadowy figures of a large man. Eventually, all three witness the injured girl together at the boys' home where they follow her to the basement and watch as she crawls into the hole. Julie suggests they seek help from the previous owner of the house, Creepy Carl, who now lives in an abandoned glove factory surrounded by hundreds of lights and lamps. When the kids tell him that they have opened the hole, he berates them for releasing the evil inside stating that it will come for them and kill Dane. Later that night, Carl is seen scribbling in a sketchbook, almost blacking out entire pages. Carl screams, \\"I'm not done yet!\\" as the light bulbs around him pop. The sketchbook turns out to belong to Dane, who returns to the factory to retrieve it. He finds his sketchbook in the darkness; Creepy Carl is gone. Julie decides to get the group relaxed and throws a pool party. While under the water, Dane sees a shadowy figure of a giant man standing above. Once out of the pool, he notices a trail of muddy footprints which he and Julie follow, leaving Lucas alone in the pool. They hear Julie's pet dog, Charlie, barking and return to see Lucas drowning. Lucas tells them that the jester puppet had pulled him under. Later that night, while Lucas is asleep, Dane sees a hand-shaped bruise on Lucas's leg. He discovers that it is identical to a hand that Creepy Carl had drawn in the sketchbook. As he flips through the sketchbook, he realizes that each page is a puzzle piece. While working on the puzzle, Dane hears someone whistling. When he walks into the kitchen, he sees an envelope addressed to him from the New Jersey State Penitentiary. A note inside reads 'HELLO BOY'. He rushes upstairs to Lucas and tells him that someone is in the house. While Dane investigates, Lucas meets a police officer standing at the bottom of the stairs. The officer shows Lucas a picture of two little girls and asks if he has seen one of them and points to the girl whom Julie first encountered. The police officer leaves the picture with Lucas and turns to leave revealing the back of his head is missing. Lucas fetches Dane and the pair watch the cop return to the basement and climb into the hole. Next door, the girl then appears in Julie's room. Julie climbs out of her window and meets the boys where she reveals to Dane that she and her best friend, Annie Smith, were playing on the tracks of an old roller coaster which resulted in an accident where Annie fell to her death. In an attempt to help Julie, a police officer had also fallen and was killed. She decides to return to the amusement park where the accident occurred; Dane goes after her, leaving Lucas on his own. Julie finds her friend sitting on the same spot from which she fell. After Julie helps Annie understand that she had tried to save her, Annie disappears and is pleased that Julie is no longer scared. Meanwhile, Lucas hears Dane calling him to the basement. Confused, he follows the voice to discover the jester puppet mimicking Dane's voice. The puppet attacks Lucas, but is outwitted and eventually destroyed. Dane and Julie return and Lucas announces that he is no longer afraid of clowns. Dane then tells them of a theory that once you look into the hole, it somehow knows you and creates whatever you are afraid of. When asked what he is afraid of, Dane replies that he is not afraid of anything. Julie then invites Dane and Lucas to stay at her place for the night. As Lucas is gathering his things, Dane shows Julie the puzzle he had been working on. They solve the puzzle together and see a boy being grabbed by a giant man. Dane rushes upstairs to find that Lucas is gone. Dane finally reveals that he is afraid of his father, who had abused the entire family and is now in prison. Realizing that his father has taken Lucas into the hole, Dane jumps into the hole as well. Dane finds Lucas hiding in the closet of a twisted version of their old home. Their father, who has become a giant, discovers them and starts to break through the door. They turn around and discover the shelving seems to be a ladder. Dane tells Lucas to start climbing. Dane starts to follow, until his father drags him back down. As Dane fights him off, the giant father slowly returns to his actual size as Dane starts to confront his fear, seeing him for what he really is. Their surroundings begin to crumble and the floor falls away leaving Dane and his father trapped on an island under a ceiling fan. Having taken his father's belt, Dane pulls himself onto the fan and gives the crumbling floor one final blow with the belt buckle causing the floor to break apart and the father to fall. Dane emerges from the hole where Julie and Lucas are waiting. They close the hole, just as their mother comes down to the basement. She sees the trapdoor and opens it, revealing a shallow crawl space below. As the group heads upstairs, Lucas asks his mom if she is afraid of anything. She replies that she was afraid of a monster under her bed when she was a little girl. Lucas says, \\"Uh oh,\\" as the trapdoor blows open again revealing the darkness has returned. In the post-credits, the jester puppet is shown winking his left eye. Cast Production The film began shooting in 3D on December 5, 2008, in Vancouver, Canada.

Rectangle at lower right is evaporation pond for salt plant. Gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) at Laguna Ojo de Liebre Ojo de Liebre Lagoon (formerly known as Scammon's Lagoon), translated into English as \\"hare eye lagoon\\", is a coastal lagoon located in Muleg√© Municipality near the town of Guerrero Negro in the northwestern Baja California Sur state of Mexico. It lies approximately halfway between the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula and the U.S.-Mexico border, opening onto the Pacific Ocean. The lagoon is within the Vizca√≠no Biosphere Reserve UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is a Ramsar wetlands site. It also is the site of the biggest commercial saltworks plant in the world. It is an important habitat for the reproduction and wintering of the gray whale and harbor seal, as well as other marine mammals including the California sea lion, northern elephant seal and blue whale. Four species of endangered marine turtles reproduce there. It is an important refuge for waterfowl in the winter. Encompassing both a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a major salt plant, Laguna Ojo de Liebre embodies the diverse worlds of natural habitat and industrialization. Tourism, now closely controlled, was formerly a threat to the gray whales. Geography The lake and surroundings Laguna Ojo de Liebre is a large, shallow salty watery habitat that is wide, long and from in depth. Relatively deep channels cut through the lagoon between its broad intertidal flats. The climate is dry and warm; the annual temperature ranges from 18 ¬∞C and 22 ¬∞C. Annual rainfall can vary from none to 200 mm. The lagoon is surrounded by coastal dunes ranging from in height, which support an unstable community of vegetation, and sandy beaches, some of them with shoals. Geology Geological studies indicated that Laguna Ojo de Liebre began as a pocket beach on the coastal plain of Baja California at a time when the ocean was some 12 meters lower than today's level. Tidal changes resulted in the formation of inlets and sediment from nearby river gradually built a barrier to form the lagoon. Salt works Industrialization is leaving its mark on the lagoon and surrounding area. There is a rectangular evaporation pond for the harvesting of salt, some large salt flats, and other barriers and channels built to enclose and flood shallow brine pans on the eastern side of the lagoon (yellow-greenish in color in the picture at right ). The Ojo de Liebre lagoon has the biggest saltworks plant in the world ‚Äì Exportada de Sal S.A. (ESSA). The company makes salt from seawater which is pumped into concentration ponds measuring 33,000 hectares. The salt plant creates an effluent called bittern (a liquor remaining after salt-boiling) that is discharged into the lagoon. In December 1997, 94 green turtles were found dead weeks after the company discharged bitterns into the lagoon. The bitterns were investigated for fluoride content and were found to contain over 100 mg per liter. ESSA had earlier claimed that the bitterns contained the same salts present as seawater, only more concentrated (20-fold). F- was found to be 60.5 times higher than F- in sea water. History In December 1857, Charles Melville Scammon, in the brig Boston, accompanied by the schooner-tender Marin, under Lefft, first entered Laguna Ojo de Liebre to hunt the gray whales breeding there. They caught twenty. Scammon returned to the lagoon the next winter (1858‚Äì59), this time with the bark Ocean Bird and the schooner-tenders A.M. Simpson and Kate, under Easton and Hale. He caught forty-seven cows, which produced of oil. He was accompanied by six other vessels (five barks and one schooner), which obtained an additional of oil (about 150 whales). A high of eleven vessels visited the lagoon in the winter of 1859-60, but they obtained considerably less oil‚Äî (c. 140 whales). Eight vessels (all sent by U.S. merchants, except one: the Russian brig Constantine, under Otto Wilhelm Lindholm) the next season got even less: a little over from about 90 whales. Only a few ships visited the lagoon the following three seasons‚Äîin the first season they obtained ; the second ; and in the third only about . When the bark Louisa visited the lagoon in the winter of 1872-73 she only obtained of oil. It was abandoned after that.

It was only released as a promotional single in South Korea. The singer was inspired to write the ballad after a water balloon fight with children in Germany. Jackson collaborated on the production with musicians such as Jeremy Lubbock, Brad Buxer, Novi Novoq, Stuart Bradley and Bruce Swedien. Andra√© Crouch and his gospel choir provided backing vocals. Executives at Jackson's record label, Epic Records, responded positively to the track when given a preview several months before Invincibles release. \\"Speechless\\" was issued as a promotional single. Music critics focused on the track's a cappellas, lyrics and music. A clip of Jackson singing \\"Speechless\\" was included in the 2009 documentary- concert film Michael Jackson's This Is It. Writing and recording Michael Jackson wrote \\"Speechless\\" after a water balloon fight with children in Germany. It took him 45 minutes. In an interview with Vibe magazine, the musician commented, \\"I was so happy after the fight that I ran upstairs in their house and wrote 'Speechless'. Fun inspires me. I hate to say that, because it's such a romantic song.\\" He added, \\"But it was the fight that did it. I was happy, and I wrote it in its entirety right there. I felt it would be good enough for the album. Out of the bliss comes magic, wonderment, and creativity.\\"Jones, p. 283 Jackson would consider \\"Speechless\\" to be one of his favorite songs on Invincible.Michael Jackson's interview with Getmusic.com.

October 26, 2001 \\"Speechless\\" was one of only two songs from Invincible to be written solely by Jackson (the second song being \\"The Lost Children\\").Taraborrelli, p. 612 Jeremy Lubbock worked with the musician in arranging and conducting an orchestra. Instrumentalists on the track included Brad Buxer on keyboards, and Novi Novog and Thomas Tally on violas. The violinists consisted of Peter Kent, Gina Kronstadt, Robin Lorentz, Kirstin Fife and John Wittenberg. The track featured backing vocals from Andra√© Crouch and his gospel choir, The Andra√© Crouch Singers. \\"Speechless\\" was digitally edited by Buxer and Stuart Brawley, and was mixed by Bruce Swedien,Liner notes of Invincible by Michael Jackson who later said, \\"Everything with Michael is a stand-out moment but an absolutely gorgeous piece of music called 'Speechless' was really an event. Michael sings the first eight bars a cappella. At the end, he closes it off a cappella ‚Äì it was Michael's idea to add the a cappella parts.\\"Grant, p. 296 Composition The lyrics to \\"Speechless\\" deal with being lost for words because of love. The song opens with Jackson's singing a cappella: \\"Your love is magical, that's how I feel, but I have not the words here to explain\\", which Rick de Yampert of The Daytona Beach News-Journal felt the singer \\"[crooned] sweetly\\". The chorus includes the lines, \\"Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel. Though I'm with you, I am far away and nothing is for real.\\" A second a cappella verse bookends the track. \\"Speechless\\" is a ballad, and labeled it as \\"neo-gospel\\". According to Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing. It adds that the track was performed in common time, with a tempo of 80 beats per minute. The song starts in the key of B major and transitions to C major. After the bridge the song transitions to D Major as a choir starts singing, the last two choruses in E Major, ending with a solo a cappella ending by Jackson. The song's vocal range is from F3 to B4. Post-production and release In June 2001, several months before the release of Invincible, \\"Speechless\\" was among several songs showcased from the album exclusively to executives of Jackson's music label, Epic Records (a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment). Other songs previewed included \\"Unbreakable\\", \\"The Lost Children\\", \\"Whatever Happens\\", \\"Break of Dawn\\", \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" and \\"Privacy\\", all of which featured on Invincibles track listing. Roger Friedman of Fox News reported that the executives who listened to the previews liked what they heard. Epic Records' president, Dave Glew, said of the tracks, \\"It's wonderful and amazing. Michael is singing better than ever.\\" He added, \\"The ballads! The ballads are beautiful, and they're all there.\\" \\"Speechless\\" was later released as a promotional single in 2001. A remixed version of \\"You Rock My World\\", featuring rapper Jay-Z, served as the single's B-side.Packaging of the \\"Speechless\\" promotional single by Michael Jackson After Jackson's death, a clip of the entertainer singing \\"Speechless\\" was included in Michael Jackson's This Is It, a commercially successful documentary-concert film of the singer's rehearsals for his London concert series. Plans to be performed on This Is It \\"Speechless\\" was considered to be performed on cancelled This Is It concerts that planned to run from July 2009 to March 2010. However, this song was ultimately off the final set list. Later members of band shared set lists for the shows. \\"Speechless\\" was marked as an additional material. That set list was dated May 22, 2009. Critical reception Craig Seymour of The Buffalo News felt that the song was the only one from the album in which Jackson successfully revisited his past. The journalist said the song was reminiscent of the 1995 chart-topper \\"You Are Not Alone\\", as it sounded to him like a track that could have been written by R. Kelly, who penned the number one hit. Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim DeRogatis described \\"Speechless\\" as a \\"beautifully minimal, heartfelt romantic ballad\\". Music journalist Roger Catlin stated that the song leaned toward \\"neo-gospel\\". The New York Post said that \\"Speechless\\" was \\"lullaby-like\\" and the best song on Invincible, and Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised Jackson's \\"long lines and creamy overdubbed choruses [sailing] weightlessly\\" in the ballad, that the journalist felt it was a love song to God. Pop music critic Robert Hilburn described \\"Speechless\\", and another song from Invincible (\\"Butterflies\\"), as being \\"as woefully generic as their titles\\". Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star contested that the a cappellas in \\"Speechless\\" were enough to make a person wish that Jackson actually was unable to make a sound. Michigan Daily writer Dustin J. Seibert wrote that the song was a \\"shining [example] of what happens when The Gloved One gets beside himself and writes smarmy crap that should be reserved for a CD changer somewhere in a preschool\\". The Fort Worth Star-Telegram said that \\"Speechless\\" was one of the weaker tracks from Invincible. Elliot Sylvester of The Independent felt that the song was \\"pure Jackson ‚Äì almost to a formulaic fault\\". The Dallas Morning News Thor Christensen said that \\"Speechless\\" was \\"produced by Mr. Jackson in bombastic style √† la Celine Dion\\". He added that as the track ended with an emotional Jackson, it drew a parallel with the singer's 1972 ode to a rat, \\"Ben\\". Vaughn Watson of The Providence Journal hailed \\"Speechless\\" as Invincibles \\"best song, and one of Jackson's finest of any album\\". He added that with the song, the musician acknowledged the pain that accompanies isolation. In a review of Invincible, The Wichita Eagle stated that \\"Speechless\\", \\"Don't Walk Away\\" and \\"Cry\\" were among the \\"sincere ballads\\" in which Jackson was exemplary. Ada Anderson of The Ball State Daily News expressed the view that \\"Speechless\\" would become a popular song, and writers for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel stated that the ballad would take time to get used to. The Dayton Daily News' Ron Rollins described the track as a \\"pretty love song\\". Music critic Kevin C. Johnson thought that \\"Speechless\\" was \\"one of [Jackson's] typical, whispery ballads that swells as it moves along\\". A journalist for The Olympian stated that the song was \\"gorgeous\\".

He had been working on the border fortifications, digging cable trenches with a backhoe loader, when he noticed that the border guards were absent and that he was apparently unobserved. He drove his backhoe loader across the control strip and anti- vehicle ditch adjoining the border fence, lifted the bucket of his backhoe loader, climbed up on it and jumped over the fence. A few metres before he reached West German territory at the top of a short slope above the border fence, he was spotted by two East German border guards, who opened fire. He was struck by nine bullets fired from Kalashnikov rifles. Fatally wounded, he bled to death just inside GDR territory, while a West German border patrol ‚Äì who saw the whole incident ‚Äì stood by helplessly. In their subsequent report on the incident, the East German border guards stated that \\"the attempted breach of the border in the direction GDR-FRG was prevented by the use of firearms and the individual succumbed to fatal injuries.\\" The incident provoked controversy in West Germany and condemnation of the GDR's \\"order to shoot\\" policy. A memorial cross was erected on the West German side of the border by local members of the (West German) Christian Democratic Union on 17 June 1982. It was inscribed with the slogan Einigkeit - Recht - Freiheit (\\"Unity - Justice - Freedom\\"). Thereafter, on each anniversary of the shooting, up to 2,000 people at a time demonstrated against the division of Germany at the point overlooking where Gro√üe was shot. The event was closely monitored by the GDR's security forces, who photographed the participants. It was not without controversy of its own; some in the West criticised the protest as mere rhetoric. The two border guards who shot Gro√üe were put on trial in 1996 in the district court of M√ºhlhausen. Aged 20 and 23 at the time of the shooting, the two former guards were convicted of joint homicide and given suspended sentences of one year and three months. Gro√üe is today commemorated by the original cross erected in 1982 as well as a memorial and explanatory display set up next to it. The memorial bears the inscription: Following the fall of the GDR in 1989, a second wooden memorial cross was set up on the spot where Gro√üe died, just inside what was East German territory. The nearby Grenzmuseum Schifflersgrund preserves the border fortifications for several hundred metres along the stretch where Gro√üe died, as well as the original backhoe loader that he used in his attempt to cross the border. The preserved border fence still retains the bullet holes caused by the burst of gunfire that killed Gro√üe.

The Boscov's store at Berkshire Mall replaced the Boscov's West store in Sinking Spring, which opened in November 1962. On the night of November 2, 2009, a fire broke out in a display window of the Victoria's Secret store. Before firefighters could arrive, the sprinkler system activated in the store and the adjacent hallway. The store suffered smoke and water damage; everyone was evacuated safely without any reported injuries. On April 14, 2010, there was a fire inside of Boscov's. A worker was flown to Lehigh Valley Hospital for severe burns to the face. Firefighters had controlled the fire in 30 minutes.

It was situated on the reach between Old Windsor Lock and Romney Lock and linked Windsor on the Berkshire bank to Datchet on the Buckinghamshire side. The bridge replaced a ferry service which had operated at the site since at least the middle of the 13th century. The first Datchet Bridge was a wooden bridge commissioned by Queen Anne as the crossing was a convenient back-way to Windsor Castle. Responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of the crossing later passed to the counties of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire over whose boundary the bridge spanned. There followed many decades of dispute between the counties over who should pay for what. This culminated in 1836 with each county deciding to build their own half, in different materials and not touching in the middle. The resulting \\"crazy erection\\", Buckinghamshire's side in wood and Berkshire's in iron, known as The Divided Bridge, was demolished in 1848 and is the only case on the Thames where an established bridge crossing site has completely disappeared. Background Datchet Mead and Datchet Ferry in 1686 with Windsor Castle in the background Datchet on the north bank of the River Thames has existed as a settlement since before 990 but the first recorded mention of a river crossing is in 1224 when Henry III gave John le Passir a \\"great oak\\" with which to make a boat for \\"passage of Datchet\\". In 1278 Edward I paid for William of Eton to a build a \\"great barge\\" for Datchet Ferry. Although the Crown had provided for the vessels, the right to operate the ferry and collect tolls sat with the Lord of the Manor of Datchet. This continued until 1680 when the then Lord of the Manor, Colonel Andrew Pitcairn Wheeler, sold the Manor of Datchet to Budd Wase but kept back the ferry rights which he subsequently mortgaged for ¬£1000 (equivalent to ¬£ today). In 1699 Wheeler wrote to William III complaining that a wall built by the King along the Windsor bank was adversely affecting the ferry trade. To settle the complaint the Crown purchased the ferry rights from Colonel Wheeler for ¬£7000 (equivalent to ¬£ today). The crossing was important to the Crown as the road through Datchet and across the Thames provided a convenient short route from London to Windsor Castle and the ferry was much used by Royalty and courtiers. Privy Purse records show two payments from Elizabeth of York to the Datchet ferryman in 1502 and similarly from Princess Mary in 1522 and her father Henry VIII between 1530 and 1532. In Elias Ashmole's account of the 1520 Procession of the order of the Garter he describes how Queen Catherine after watching the procession returned to Windsor Castle from Colnbrook by way of \\"the fery next way to the castle.\\" The ferry however did not always provide a quick and efficient service. In 1678 the ferryman, Matthew Hale, received a formal rebuke from Charles II's Secretary of State, Henry Coventry, for unduly delaying a Royal Messenger. Coventry warned Hale in no uncertain terms: Despite Coventry's warning Royal dissatisfaction with the inefficient service provided by the Hale Family, who by 1706 had kept the ferry for over 150 years, continued to grow. This culminated in the decision by Queen Anne to provide a fixed bridge crossing on the site. Queen Anne's bridge 1822 Ordnance Survey map showing the location of the river crossing at Datchet Datchet Ferry in 1811 showing the abandoned 1770 bridge just prior to its rebuilding in 1812 In 1706 a wooden bridge was built by order of Queen Anne to replace the ferry between Datchet, Buckinghamshire and Windsor, Berkshire. It was made of oak provided by the Surveyor General of Woods South of the Trent, Edward Wilcox, who was ordered to fell \\"sufficient non-navy timber\\" from the Royal forest \\"for the better convenience of our passage from our Castle at Windsor\\". The building work was supervised by the Surveyor General, Samuel Travers and the final cost was ¬£1000 (equivalent to ¬£ today) The better convenience of passage was further enhanced by Queen Anne's intimate friend Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough and her husband the first Duke who then lived at Langley and who had a carriage drive built from their house, over the bridge and on to Windsor Castle. Unlike the upstream toll bridges at Windsor and Maidenhead, the crossing at Datchet was toll-free for both River and road and quickly became a popular crossing. Seeking compensation for loss of income on their bridges, the corporations of Windsor and Maidenhead made claims to the Treasury. In 1708 Windsor was granted an ex-gratia payment of ¬£55 (equivalent to ¬£ today) plus ¬£25 and ¬£20 to two tenants (equivalent to ¬£ and ¬£ respectively). Maidenhead's complaint, not made until 1714, was noted but no compensation paid. The bridge was initially maintained by the Crown which paid ¬£800 (equivalent to ¬£ today) for repairs in 1737 and in 1770 replaced the original all-wood structure with a bridge of ten wooden arches on stone piers. By 1794 the bridge was \\"absolutely dangerous for carriages to pass over it and a stone one [was] now in contemplation.\\" Later the same year the central arches of the new bridge collapsed during heavy flooding and King George III deciding that he did not wish to finance the rebuilding instead instated a temporary free ferry. There followed many years of wrangling between the Crown and the counties of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire over who should bear the cost of the building and maintenance of the bridge as the county boundary ran down the centre of the channel of the Thames thus cutting the bridge in half. The matter was forced by the intervention of John Richards, the Rector of Datchet who was also a lawyer; Richards took legal action and the resulting judgement from the King's Bench in 1809 was that the two counties must equally share the rebuilding costs, a total of ¬£2,375 each (equivalent to ¬£ today). The counties, forced to co-operate, built a new wooden bridge on the old stone piers which was opened by Queen Charlotte and Princess Elizabeth on 4 December 1812. The Divided Bridge The Divided Bridge in 1847 from the Berkshire bank The co-operation was short-lived and arguments over maintenance started again in 1834 when the Buckinghamshire side needed repairs and Berkshire refused to contribute. Lack of maintenance led to the bridge collapsing once more in 1836 and the counties came up with the unique solution of each building their own half. Buckinghamshire decided to rebuild with wooden railings whilst Berkshire built its half in iron suspended by chains. Kelly's Directory of 1847 noted: > \\"Datchet is separated from Windsor by the river Thames, over which is a very > singular bridge; one half of it is kept in repair by the county of Bucks and > the other half by Berks. The former has a wooden railing and the latter an > iron one, suspended by chains, but neither the Bucks nor Berks sides touch > each other.\\" Even during the building the counties would not work together and had to be ordered by the Lord Chancellor to \\"proceed in such a manner as not to impede each other\\". Consequently when the bridge was finished the two sides did not touch in the middle with Berkshire's final span being cantilevered out from the last Berkshire stone pier thus needing no support from the Buckinghamshire side. The result was an unsatisfactory, ungainly structure, sarcastically noted on opening as having \\"scarce a bridge upon the River Thames which surpasses it\\". The centre gap was apparent during the Divided Bridge's whole lifetime and lacking structural integrity the \\"hideous monstrosity\\" quickly became unsafe: > \\"It was no wonder that when Wombwell took his caravans across the crazy > erection, the elephant-van broke through and the beast in it nearly came to > an untimely end.\\" The dispute between the counties was resolved once and for all in 1848 when the Windsor Castle Act 1848 decreed the dismantling of the Divided Bridge and the building of two new road bridges, Victoria Bridge slightly upstream, and Albert Bridge slightly downstream. Both new bridges opened in 1851. Once the Divided Bridge was demolished the old Windsor to Datchet road was rerouted over Victoria Bridge and the Berkshire side became part of the private grounds of Windsor Castle. This is the only case on the entire Thames where a main bridge crossing has completely disappeared. Legacy Site of Datchet Bridge looking south-west down Datchet High Street towards the Berkshire bank and Windsor Great Park A small plaque erected by the Datchet Parish Council in 2000 is the only reminder of the Divided Bridge. Datchet High Street which once continued on over the bridge to Berkshire ends abruptly at the Thames and the bank on the Buckinghamshire side is now occupied by a marina car park. The Crown and Angel public house on the Berkshire bank depicted in many of the contemporary drawings of the bridge was demolished at the same time as the bridge; a Victorian estate cottage now stands its place.

The program aired from 1997 to 2015, making it one of the longest- running sports talk shows on Canadian television. History The half-hour show featured guests from various backgrounds, ranging from sports athletes to reporters to political figures or even entertainers, participating as panelists in a round table discussion on notable sports events of the day, with Landsberg serving as the moderator. Occasionally, an episode would feature just one guest in a one-on-one interview with Landsberg, usually from the sports world or WWE personalities. Prior to the second commercial break of the show, a portion of the commercial bumper included a \\"Quirky Fact\\" shown on the screen related either to the major sports topic of the day, or in relation to the guest being interviewed by Landsberg. Prior to the third commercial break, a portion of the bumper included Landsberg reading a witty e-mail to the show from a viewer, often in the form of quips directed towards him. However, when there was a one-on-one interview that Landsberg was conducting with someone that was dealing with an issue of seriousness or solemness, this segment would be omitted. During its initial years, Landsberg would always preface before the discussion with his guest panel or one-on-one guest interview that whatever opinions were stated by his guests on the program would be off the record and could therefore not be used against them. This practice, however, eventually disappeared in later seasons. In later years, the guest panel segment was sandwiched between the opening \\"Up Front\\" segment (where Landsberg would ask a guest one-on-one questions in relation to a sports issue of the day) and the closing \\"Next Question\\" segment (where Landsberg would rattle off a series of one-on-one questions that relates to the guest's interests and background). Clips of Off The Record were featured in the 1998 documentary film Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows. One of the show's most noted moments occurred in an episode in which Gene Simmons, Thea Andrews and Mark Tewksbury were guests.

He is well known for his energetic and technical virtuosity on the bass and his heartfelt vocal performances. Biography McCarvill was born and grew up in Milford, Connecticut. He began playing bass at age 12, his first instrument a Peavey Patriot bass guitar. Upon graduation of High School, Chris attended and graduated the Musician's Institute's (MI) bass school (BIT) in Hollywood, California. He met songwriting partner and close friend Craig Polivka in Hollywood. After graduating MI, McCarvill and Polivka met singer Jeff Scott Soto (ex Journey, Yngwie Malmsteen). Chris and Craig recorded and played several shows with Jeff and his band Slam in the early nineties. The band was short lived and the two returned to their native Connecticut. In May 2011, Mr. McCarvill began teaching Bass at Route 1 Guitars in Milford, Connecticut. 1990s Chris began doing session work in Boston as a bassist and also landed a full-time job as a graphic artist. He joined heavy metal band X Factor X, and continued to write with Polivka. During this time, Chris taught himself symphonic orchestration and developed his recording techniques, resulting in his renowned bass piece Demon Wheel. 2000-2004 Chris met vocalist Michael Vescera (Obsession, ex Loudness and Yngwie Malmsteen), and began recording bass on Mike's solo material as well as new Obsession music. He also created album covers for several of Vescera's releases. Other musicians Chris met through Vescera were: BJ Zampa (drums), Jimi Bell (guitar) and Robert Marcello (guitar). McCarvill met Twisted Sister guitarist Eddie Ojeda, and began recording and playing live with Eddie's Band Of Steel with BJ Zampa and X Factor X vocalist Andre Vanchot. Chris was tapped by the Rockhouse Instructional Method Company to record a series of Instructional beginner DVDs and a ‚ÄúSlap and Pop‚Äù DVD. His bass DVD are top sellers worldwide. In addition to the heavier styles he is associated with, Chris began to develop a taste for recording punk inspired pop music, along with more progressive musical pieces. 2005-2009 Chris had a chance meeting with Soto in California. He subsequently toured Europe and South America with Soto's solo band. Soon after, McCarvill became a member of House of Lords, and began recording and touring Europe with Connecticut natives James Christian, BJ Zampa and Jimi Bell. In 2008, McCarvill was introduced to Dokken by his long-time friend Jim Paidas of Paidas Management to act as touring bassist for the band on their summer run with Poison and Sebastian Bach on the ‚ÄúLive, Raw and Uncut‚Äù tour. BJ Zampa was added on drums halfway through the summer. At the end of this tour Chris and BJ formed the Samurai Cab Company, with McCarvill on lead vocals and bass guitar. Chris also recorded a ‚Äúmasterwork‚Äù with BJ Zampa on drums called ‚ÄúVenus Supercharger‚Äù. 2010-2014 McCarvill and Zampa continued to tour and/or record with House of Lords. Big Money was released in 2011, Precious Metal in 2014, and Indestructible in 2015. Obsession began recording and playing shows again, featuring Mike Vescera, BJ Zampa, Scott Boland, and X Factor X guitarist John Bruno. Eddie Ojeda was also recording new material with McCarvill, Zampa and Vanchot. In addition to performing cover songs, The Samurai Cab Company started recording and performing original music featuring most of McCarvill's songwriting over the years. Their debut self-titled EP was released in August 2010 and sold out in just three weeks. The 4 songs are still available as digital downloads through online services. The band had written and begun recording new original songs for a planned full-length album. The Samurai Cab Company consists of Chris McCarvill, BJ Zampa, Chuck Beckman on guitar, and keyboardist Jeff Baryla. In 2012, McCarvill recorded bass for Chris Bickley's Tapestry of Souls. Several other guest artists & vocalists are featured on the album, including Zampa and Vescera. McCarvill formed Maxx Explosion with Zampa, Beckman, and additional guitarist Jimi Bell. Maxx Explosion later consisted of just McCarvill, Zampa, and Bell. By 2013, Maxx Explosion released their debut album Forever. The Samurai Cab Company was dissolved (Beckman went on to play in several other bands, including the Zaubi Acoustic Duo featuring Sharon Zaubi; Baryla pursued his solo project Demons Run, then later co-founded Hard Candy). Obsession replaced McCarvill and Zampa with Jeff Curtiss and Yani Sofianos, respectively, in 2014. 2015-2020 Maxx Explosion continued to gain popularity and fans over the years. The band recorded and released their second album Dirty Angels in 2015. McCarvill writes most of the music, arrangements, and lyrics for Maxx Explosion. An early version of \\"Over You\\" (from Dirty Angels) was to be on The Samurai Cab Company full-length, which never came to fruition. After several years as a touring member of Dokken, the band officially welcomed Chris McCarvill to the group (replacing Steve McNabb as their bassist) in 2015. In 2018, Maxx Explosion added another member to their lineup. Mark Zito of Equinoxx joined as keyboardist. On September 19, 2019 Maxx Explosion announced on their Facebook page that they're almost done writing new music, and they hope to start recording their third album soon. Family Chris is married to Leah, whom he met when he was 12. They have one son, Alexander, born in 2001. They reside in Plymouth, Connecticut. Gear To make his playing more efficient, he built ‚Äúramps‚Äù for his basses. He had noticed BIT instructor Gary Willis‚Äô idea of fitting a block of wood under the strings so the instrument felt like playing an upright bass. With Chris‚Äô double jointed thumbs, he came up with his own solution of completely covering the pickup area with thin plastic, which he found, did not affect the sound. McCarvill has built and used his own ramps on almost all of his basses since 1990. After his favorite bass (a magenta Ibanez RD707) was stolen from a car in Hollywood in 1993, Chris started modifying his next bass to fit all of his criteria. His new orange Ibanez RD707 ended up with a custom made neck, different pickups, electronics and hardware. Chris wore this bass out over the next ten years. As this bass began to age, McCarvill began designing his own bass from the ground up and built it with the help of friend and machine shop owner Mark Clapp. The result was his green 2005 Magbass which is still one of his main instruments. He also uses a red and black neck-through Charvel 3B that he customized and painted himself.

The Board selected a site north of Dixon and the colony opened on May 1, 1918. In 1917, the Department of Public Welfare assumed responsibility for the colony and retained control until the creation of the Department of Mental Health in 1961 (L. 1961, p. 2666), which was called the Dixon State School at the time. In 1921, the duties of the institution expanded to include care for the mentally retarded, and 158 \\"feeble minded' clients were transferred from the Lincoln State School to alleviate overcrowding there. To reflect this change, the colony was renamed Dixon State Hospital and later Dixon State School. In 1927, the state opened a school for practical nursing at the institution.

Life and career He was born to a Jewishhttp://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3230-bettelheim family and studied law, and for some time was engaged in active practise, but abandoned the profession for a literary career. Although he had received his degree of \\"doctor of law\\", he attended the lectures of Giesebrecht and Michael Bernays at Munich on literary subjects. Fired by the eloquence and enthusiasm of the latter, he undertook the study of Beaumarchais' life and writings, and, to this end, resolved to make original investigations in the libraries of London, Paris, The Hague, Carlsruhe, and Spain. After an extended tour through Germany, France, England, and Spain, Bettelheim became, in 1880, the feuilleton editor of the Vienna \\"Presse\\". He retained this position until 1884, when he became editor of the \\"Deutsche Wochenschrift\\". In 1886, he joined the editorial staff of the \\"Deutsche Zeitung\\", which position he resigned shortly after to publish the \\"Biographische Bl√§tter\\", subsequently issued as \\"Biographisches Jahrbuch und Deutscher Nekrolog\\".

Cundick, March 2010 Robert Milton Cundick Sr. (November 26, 1926 ‚Äì January 7, 2016) was a Latter-day Saint composer. He also served for many years as an organist at the Mormon Tabernacle. This included accompanying the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and playing organ solos on the weekly broadcast, Music and the Spoken Word.  Early life  Cundick was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1926. He spent his childhood in Sandy, Utah. His parents, Milton and Florence Pierson Cundick, were both faithful and devoted members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the standards of the Church were a major influence on his life. His interest in music began early in life as he played in bands and orchestras, as well as serving as the organist for weekly church services (by age 12 he had become organist for his congregation). As his organ skills progressed, he was privileged to become the student of Mormon Tabernacle Organist Alexander Schreiner.  Young Adulthood  After serving in the United States Merchant Marine during World War II, Cundick immediately enrolled at the University of Utah, despite the fact that his Merchant Marine service was not covered by the G.I. Bill of Rights. Cundick worked hard to pay for his education, and received his BFA, MFA and eventual PhD in Music Composition from the University. He was privileged to study under the tutelage of internationally famous composer Leroy J. Robertson. It was during his time as a university student that Cundick married his wife, Charlotte (Cholly) Clark. Clark was an organ student of Cundick‚Äôs. The couple made their home in Salt Lake City, where Cundick was able to continue his university studies.  Life Experiences  Cundick joined the music faculty at BYU in 1957. In 1962, LDS Church President David O. McKay called Cundick and his family (including five children ages 5‚Äì11) to go to London, England, to serve as the organist at the new Hyde Park Chapel. While in England, Cundick appeared in concert at St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and King‚Äôs College, Cambridge, in addition to his daily recitals at Hyde Park Chapel and a BBC broadcast. After completing this two- year mission, Cundick and his family returned to Provo, Utah, where he resumed his teaching and compositional activity at BYU. This was interrupted when Cundick was called to serve as an organist at the Mormon Tabernacle, located on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah. He served for twenty-seven years. Following his retirement in 1991, Cundick and his wife were called to serve as Directors of Hosting at the BYU Jerusalem Center in Jerusalem, Israel. Since his retirement as Tabernacle Organist, Cundick has sought to publicize serious works of Utah and Mormon composers. In 2004 he won the Life Time achievement Pearl Award. Cundick continued to devote much of his time to composition and other music related activities, always making time to serve those around him. In 2007 he released a CD containing compositions from over 50 years of his creativity. Cundick died January 7, 2016.http://www.mormontabernaclechoir.org/articles/robert-cundick-passes- away.html?cid=social_20160107_57044726&adbid;=10154745804623868&adbpl;=fb&adbpr;=19919948867  Compositions  The current English LDS hymnal has two hymns with music by Cundick: hymn number 198 \\"That Easter Morn\\" (words by Marion D.

A stream with a dendritic drainage pattern, for example, can be subject to slow tectonic uplift. However, as the uplift occurs, the stream erodes through the rising ridge to form a steep-walled gorge. The stream thus keeps its dendritic pattern even though it flows over a landscape that will normally produce a trellis drainage pattern.Grotzinger, J. & Jordan, T.H. 2006. Understanding Earth, 5th ed., Freeman, New York A superposed stream is a stream that forms over horizontal beds that overlie folded and faulted rock with varying resistance. Having cut down through the horizontal beds, the stream retains its course and pattern as it proceeds to erode the underlying rocks despite their different character. The stream erodes a gorge in the resistant bed and continues its flow as before.  Examples  * Many Himalayan rivers are good examples of antecedent origin. These rivers originated well before the Himalayan region was uplifted. The rivers Indus, Brahmaputra, Sutlej, Kosi and Subansiri originated on the Tibetan side and now traverse the existing mountain ranges, cutting deep gorges. * The Colorado River cut the Grand Canyon as the Colorado Plateau rose between 5 and 2.5 million years ago. Paradox Valley is another good example in the Colorado Plateau. * Devil's Gate in Wyoming is a remarkable display of an antecedent stream. A 100-meter slot is cut through a granite ridge which would have missed the ridge completely had the river flowed just a kilometer to the south. * The Meuse still flows south-north from France to Belgium through the Ardennes which were elevated after the river had assumed that course.

Daher was ordained bishop in May 1802 and he received the Pallium, the sign of patriarchal authority, from Pope Pius VII on December 20, 1802. Due to his patriarchal ministry, Daher was required to inhabit in the Patriarchal See of Al-Charfet (or Sharfeh) monastery in Lebanon in place of his preferred town, Aleppo. In 1805 he asked Rome to move the See from Al-Charfet to Aleppo, without success. He was also suspected of embezzling the property of the Al- Charfet monastery.

History The M7 (T26E4) snow tractor was standardized in August 1943, and was downgraded to Limited standard in November 1944. It was intended to pull a one-ton M19 snow trailer (T48). The tractor used many Allis Chalmers farm tractor components. It also used many MB jeep powertrain components to lessen the military's spare parts inventory requirements. The distinguishing feature of the M7 was the track system (halftrack). The M7‚Äôs track ran on two rubber belts with four steel cables inside. The machine had a tendency to have the tracks come off in use. Another feature of both the tractor and trailer is that the tires could be switched with skis. Prototyping of the machine that eventually became the M7 included several machines by Emmett Tucker ( of subsequent Tucker Sno-Cat fame ) At least one of the prototypes, a T26E3, still exists. Something over ten percent of production, over 30 units, still survive. The track system and track plate width (18\\") look to have been borrowed from the early versions of the Weasel, although the M7 tracks are shorter with fewer plates. M19 snow trailer M19 1-ton snow trailer Saginaw Products made the M19 ski-wheel trailers. Two production batches are known, one in 1944 and one in 1950. The M19 trailer had a net weight of 640 lbs, and a payload of 2,000 lbs. It had a wooden body on a steel hollow-section frame, with hood, hoops, side and end panels all easily detachable, and it was normally equipped with a heater and two stretchers, plus a rear pintle hitch so that trailers could be doubled up. The two-bolt mounting pintle hitch was unique to the M7 and M19, and would not accommodate even an ordinary MB / GPW jeep trailer lunette. They had three main functions; Rescue and recovery, for which they were equipped with two stretchers and a personnel heater Aircraft starting, for which they were outfitted with much larger aircraft engine heaters and slave power equipment Cargo, for which they could be operated with or without canvas hood, top bows, side and end frames Serial numbers for the 1950 units seem to start at 1,000 and were dated around November of that year, suggesting they were made to supplement a batch of 1944 originals that were going to Norway, and seem to top out around 1,150. It is quite likely that the 1944 batch did not run to as much as 1,000 units, as 600 would have supplied two trailers for every M7 that Allis Chalmers built. Estimated total production would be around 750 ( 600 in 1944 and 150 in 1950 ) but many 1950 trailers seem to have survived due to careful use by the Norwegian Army. The 1944 originals had several noted weak points which can all be attributed to the lightness of construction ( they were rated at 2,000 lbs, same as a Ben Hur trailer, but weighed only one third as much - 640 lbs ) The 1944 tow bar frames had holes for bolting through the drag chains - 1950 trailers had no holes and drag chain ends welded to the tow frame. The 1944 skis were mostly wood / ply with metal brackets and strake - 1950 trailers had metal sheath underneath, with strake welded to it. The 1944 front support legs were quite short - 1950 support legs were lengthened by a couple of inches. The 1944 units came with ordinary MB / GPW split combat rims, 1950 units came with 15\\" solid rims, which were interchangeable and might have been from M series jeeps. (clarification needed) In addition to those points they tried to recover as much weight as they could by lightening. The 1944 heavy rectangular bracket for mounting the heater was replaced by a much lighter flimsy unit on the 1950 production. The type of plug and socket for the lights and auxiliary power also looks to have been updated. Despite this rework all M19s are very prone to damage. The trailer body will bend noticeably when loaded away from the axle line and normally stays out of flat. The tow frame is a fabrication work of art, being split, angled, and welded, but this results in a lot of work and since they appear not to have been coated internally when new, most are now quite weak as a result of internal rusting. The canvas covers were insulated by quilting, and had one green side and one white side, plus flaps and reinforcement for the various heater and ventilation exhaust outputs - many of which were doubled to allow the covers to be reversible. The low tow hitch position and small tow ring means they were really only suitable for towing behind an M7, as they dragged at quite an angle when hitched to a Weasel. An M7 tractor could tow two loaded M19 trailers on solid going such as an ice or snow-covered road, and when rougher ground was to be traversed it would drop one unit and shuttle them across the rougher ground one at a time.

She was born in Oloron-Sainte-Marie, France, more precisely in the district of Sainte-Croix, Oloron, rue Merci√®re N¬∫13, (erstwhile called rue Centule). She died in San Mart√≠n, Mendoza, Argentina. Anna Larroucau, daughter of Louis Barth√©l√©my Larroucau and Justine Laborde, was the elder of 16 brothers, all born in Oloron. Towards 1878 Anna migrated to Argentina, in company of her uncles and some brothers. In Argentina, Anna worked as an educational governess and during a certain time, she also taught music and French. She was fluent in Basque, Gascon, Spanish and French. Friend of the writer Jules Supervielle's family. Anna pursued her studies at the famous Coll√®ge Sacr√©-C≈ìur of Oloron. Anna Larroucau's obituary, Newspaper: Los Andes, Mendoza, Argentina, September 4, 1956 Towards 1880, Anna Larroucau introduced in San Martin, Mendoza, the first plants of grapevine of French origin, which she had brought from Bordeaux, France. In all of Mendoza grapevines of Spanish or Italian origins were slowly replaced by these new ones of French origin, providing an improved performance and an optimization of wine. On July 27, 1887, in San Martin, Mendoza, she married Leopoldo Lucero Rincons, a famous farm and cousin of the governor of the neighbor Province of San Luis, General Brigadier Pablo Lucero. The couple Lucero Larroucau will give rise to an important lineage in all of Argentina. Towards 1900 Anna Larroucau, already widow, founded the First Company of Charity of San Mart√≠n, Mendoza.

Overview  The Sir Wilfrid Laurier Memorial was constructed in 1953 by Joseph-√âmile Brunet on the southern side of Dorchester Square, facing towards the United States. Wilfrid Laurier was a proponent of an early free-trade agreement with the United States and wanted to develop a more continental economic orientation. Also, as Canada's first French Canadian Prime Minister, he faces off against the tribute to Sir John A. Macdonald, across the street in what is now Place du Canada. Macdonald is enshrined in a stone baldachin emblazoned with copper reliefs of the various agricultural and industrial trades. Laurier stands with the shelter of the massive trees which characterize the square, a granite relief of the provinces created and united under his administrations opposite a bas-relief of man and woman sharing the harvest. Laurier also stands with his back facing the back of the Boer War Memorial ‚Äî It was Britain's wish, but Laurier was not prepared to freely commit Canadian troops to Pretoria. The Boer War placed great strains on Laurier's cabinet, because a decision to send troops as required, could also have been construed as Canada's perpetual support to all England's wars. Being the great statesman that Laurier was, he did not wish to alienate Canadian Imperialists and French Canadians. \\"Whilst I cannot admit that Canada should take part in all the wars of Great Britain, neither am I prepared to say that she should not take part in any war at all... I claim for Canada this, that in the future, she shall be at liberty to act or not act, to interfere or not interfere, to do just as she pleases.\\" In the end, public demand won through and Canada sent some 7,300 Canadians to South Africa, of which about 1/3 were official contingents. The Laurier Memorial Committee was founded in 1948 under the auspices of the Canadian Democratic Institute and the Canadian Unity Alliance in order to erect a memorial to Sir Wilfrid Laurier. His inauguration took place on October 12, 1953. The activities of the Monument Committee ended at the end of 1954.

It was founded by Mai Spijkers in 1989. Bert Bakker is a notable imprint of Prometheus.  History   Bert Bakker  Bert Bakker was founded in 1898 as D.A. Daamen's Uitgeversmij. Just before the second-world war it was bought by Bert Bakker (1912), a young Christian poet. During the first years of the war he sold the complete stock but as he could only publish new books illegally, he joined the underground newspaper Vrij Nederland. After the war he sold most of the activities of Daame started the literary magazine Maatstaf and published quite successfully poetry in paperback (Ooievaarpockets). In 1956 he published Het bittere kruid, een kleine kroniek by Marga Minco. The memoirs of a Jewish girl whose family was taken to the extermination camps in Germany and had to live with that. In 1966 his nephew and namesake Bert Bakker jr (1942) joined the company (then Bert Bakker/Daamen) after he was trained in the booktrade and as a representative. In 1968 he took over the daily routine and started publishing the works of Marquis de Sade which was up till then forbidden literature. In 1970, after the death of Bert Bakker sr, Bet Bakker was named 'statutair directeur' after which he changed the name in uitgeverij Bert Bakker. After two years Bert Bakker found a buyer in Kluwer, a conglomerate in Deventer. The publishing company was founded by \\"legendary\\" publisher Bert Bakker, who was succeeded by his nephew, also named Bert Bakker, in 1969. The younger Bakker's tenure was marked by conflict; he himself had little knowledge of literature and kept the company afloat by publishing a number of non-literary books. Bakker was forced to resign from the company in 1993, \\"een puinzooi achterlatend\\" (\\"leaving a mess\\"). The company merged with Prometheus, another publishing company, and the joint group was owned by PCM Uitgevers. Bakker was succeeded by Mai Spijkers, who had earlier been an editor for Bakker but had been forced out and, credited with a keen eye for business, had made the competitor Prometheus a success; he led Prometheus/Bert Bakker after then-president Van Albada left the company in 2003. Prometheus/Bert Bakker became one of the largest literary publishers in the Netherlands, publishing best-selling authors such as Connie Palmen, Maria Stahlie, Tim Krabb√©, Hafid Bouazza, and Martin Bril, besides prominent historians and politicians such as Frits van Oostrom, Wouter Bos and Wijnand Duyvendak.  Prometheus  Prometheus was founded by former Bert Bakker editor-in-chief Mai Spijkers in 1989. Prometheus was created as part of the Malherbe Group, whose books department was sold to Meulenhoff in 1991, after which Bert Bakker was also acquired by Meulenhoff and Spijkers became director of the three merged publishing companies. In 1994‚Äì5 they merged into PCM Uitgevers, where the educational branch of Meulenhoff was detached to merge with two other educational book companies to form ThiemeMeulenhoff in 2000, while Bert Bakker merged into Prometheus. Both were bought back by founder Mai Spijkers in 2007, making Uitgeverij Prometheus an independent publishing company with Bert Bakker as an imprint. Bert Bakker -both the company and the owner- were known for their fierce support of Dutch poets (against the grain of commercialism), and supported and published poets such as Paul van Ostaijen, Martinus Nijhoff and A. Roland Holst. His last publication was a book of poetry by Neeltje Maria Min; the latter's Voor wie ik liefheb wil ik heten became the most successful Dutch collection of poetry ever.

Although seven people faced charges related to the rape, one was released after a preliminary hearing. Five of the remaining six faced life imprisonment, should the charges be upheld, and one faced a maximum of eight years in jail. All initially pleaded not guilty. The incident received national attention. As many as 20 witnesses are believed to have been aware of the attack, but for more than two hours no one notified the police. The trials for the six defendants began September 2012, with defendant Manuel Ortega pleading guilty to four felonies and sentenced the following month to 32 years in prison. Ari Morales was sentenced to 27 years in prison. Jose Montano and Marceles Peter were convicted of forcible rape acting in concert, a forcible act of sexual penetration while acting in concert, and forcible oral copulation in concert. Details On October 24, 2009 at about 9:30 p.m. (UTC-7), at the conclusion of the homecoming dance, a classmate invited the victim to join a group of males ranging in ages from 15 to late 40s, who were drinking alcohol in a dark courtyard on campus. The female victim drank an undetermined amount of brandy by choice, and was propositioned for sex by the alleged attackers. When the victim refused, she was placed on a nearby concrete bench and continuously beaten and raped for 2¬Ω hours, at times with a 'foreign object'. They also poured alcohol down her throat. Test results showed she had an almost fatal blood alcohol level. A local resident heard of the attack from her boyfriend and immediately contacted the police. The victim was found unconscious under a picnic table and was air-lifted to a hospital in critical condition. She was released from the hospital on Wednesday, October 28. A bystander described the assault: > They were kicking her in her head and they were beating her up, robbing her > and ripping her clothes off; it's something you can't get out your mind. I > saw people, like, dehumanizing her; I saw some pretty crazy stuff. She was > pretty quiet; I thought she was like dead for a minute but then I saw her > moving around. I feel like I could have done something but I don't feel like > I have any responsibility for anything that happened. Witnesses are believed to have recorded video footage of the attack using camera-equipped mobile phones, but local police have not been able to obtain the recordings. At least two dozen bystanders watched the assault without calling 911 to report it. Arrests Seven male suspects had been arrested in connection with the case. One of the initial suspects was subsequently released without charge due to lack of evidence. This initial suspect has since claimed that he was merely a witness present at the scene, and that his intent was to help the victim including offering her his shirt. However, he said that he did not contact authorities because he lacked a cell phone and was afraid of retaliation for \\"snitching\\". The remaining suspects range in age from 15 to 21. Police stated that they were looking for additional people in relation to the crime. A 43-year-old male was later arrested in relation to the events. Four of the suspects were arraigned on October 29 in the Contra Costa County Superior Court in Martinez. One entered a plea of not guilty to the two charges of rape with a foreign object and rape by force, while the others chose not to enter a plea at the time. Authorities have indicated that they expect all three juvenile defendants to be charged as adults. All six suspects entered not guilty pleas on Tuesday, December 1, 2009. Response The attack shocked the community and the nation. Local media said that the act \\"crossed the boundary of civilized behavior\\". The attack became the most popular blog topic of the week of October 26‚Äì30, as bloggers expressed their outrage over the rape. During that week, more than a quarter (26%) of the links from blogs to news sites were to articles about the attack. A website was created in order to support the victim and discuss ways to prevent sexual assault on women. After the attack, some talked of vigilante justice against the attackers and onlookers. The victim's parents made their first public statement on November 1: > Please do not respond to this tragic event by promoting hatred or by causing > more pain. We have had enough violence already in this place. If you need to > express your outrage, please channel your anger into positive action. > Volunteer at a school. Go help a neighbor. Be courageous in speaking the > truth and in holding people accountable. Work toward changing the atmosphere > in our schools and in this community so that this kind of thing never > happens again. Over 500 students, parents, and area residents held a candle-lit vigil on November 3. At the vigil, the victim's church pastor read a statement from the victim, stating, \\"We realize people are angry about this,\\" but that \\"violence is always the wrong choice.\\" 200 people marched from Richmond High School to a nearby park and held a rally on November 7 to show support for the victim. In response to the events, California State Senator Leland Yee suggested legislation to broaden the criteria when failure to report a crime constitutes a criminal offense. Under Yee's proposal, bystanders to crimes against minors could be charged with a misdemeanor criminal offense for failure to immediately report the incident to the police. The 18-year-old woman who was the only person to call 911 and make police aware of the assault in progress, was honored by the Richmond City Council on November 17. Security around the school was increased following the attack: high-definition surveillance cameras were installed, along with increased lighting and new fencing. Preliminary hearing On November 15, 2010, a preliminary hearing began in Contra Costa County, during which twenty witnesses appeared before the court. Of the seven defendants, six faced charges that could lead to life imprisonment, while the seventh faced a maximum term of 26 years in jail. All of the defendants pleaded not guilty to the crime. Evidence presented during the hearing connected four of the suspects to DNA found at the scene, although there was no DNA evidence connecting the remaining three defendants to the crime. As a result of the hearing, one of the defendants was released. Of the remaining six, two had their charges reduced, with five facing life imprisonment and one facing an eight-year sentence. Trial Jury selection for trials of the defendants began September 4, 2012. Manuel Ortega, who was an adult at the time of the crime and the most heavily charged of the six defendants, pleaded guilty to all charges against him on September 6 and was sentenced on October 19, accepting a 32-year sentence and avoiding possible life in prison. He was convicted of rape in concert, rape by a foreign object in concert, forced oral copulation in concert resulting in great bodily injury, and robbery. Ortega was described by authorities as an initiator in the rape, with witnesses alleging he ripped off the girl's clothes, punched and kicked her in the head, sexually assaulted her and encouraged others to do the same. On January 11, 2013, Ari Morales was sentenced to 27 years in prison. In June 2013, in the trials of Jose Montano, 22 and Marcelles Peter, 20, the victim testified in court for the first time. She stated she had never consumed alcohol previously, and that she did not drink from a bottle of brandy the men had with them. Salvardor Rodriguez, previously sentenced, testified \\"Before she even said hello, she grabbed a bottle (of brandy) and started chugging it.\\" The prosecutor said in his opening statement that head trauma and her 0.35 blood alcohol level interfered with her memory of the events, saying, \\"They were pouring booze in her and on her, and that's after she was drinking it on her own.\\" Charges were dismissed against the then-15-year-old classmate who invited her to the courtyard. Two more men were scheduled to be tried in August 2013. Monetary settlement In January 2011 the victim received a monetary settlement from the school district of $4 million. She received an immediate payout of $2.5 million, with the remaining $1.5 million to be paid over the next 40 years.

He was named the consensus All-American at quarterback in 1912. Biography A native of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Crowther enrolled at Brown University where he played three years of varsity football. He was Brown's starting quarterback from 1910‚Äì1912. He scored 77 points on 14 touchdowns and a field goal during his career at Brown. Crowther was considered \\"a slippery runner with good speed.\\" Crowther did not wear a helmet and instead played with a white elastic band around his head. Various accounts indicate that he weighed between 130 and 135 pounds while playing football at Brown. He received the nickname \\"Kid\\" because of his small size. In a game against Harvard in 1912, the Harvard coach suggested that the diminutive Crowther should be removed for the game \\"for his own safety,\\" and Crowther responded with a 48-yard run for a touchdown in the game. Crowther's run was Brown's only touchdown against Harvard; one newspaper described the play as follows: \\"The last period was played in twilight and it was then that Crowther, the Brown quarter back, ran half the length of the field for Brown's only touchdown.\\" Crowther also handled kickoff and punt returns for Brown, and in 1911 he tied the Brown record for the longest kickoff return with a 110-yard return against UMass. Crowther also had other long runs, including a 65-yard kickoff return against Bowdoin. He also led Brown to a 30‚Äì7 win over Penn, Crowther reportedly \\"returned punts like a demon, and crisply directed four touchdown drives that had the fans at old Andrews Field delirious with joy.\\" At the end of the 1912 season, Crowthers was selected as a first-team All-American at the quarterback position by Walter Camp (for Collier's Weekly) and W.J. MacBeth. Crowther also played baseball at Brown and later in semi- professional leagues around New England. Crowther graduated from Brown in 1913. He later recalled playing against Jim Thorpe in a Thanksgiving Day game against the Carlisle Indian School. He described Thorpe as the \\"best I ever played against.\\" Crowther lived in Fitchburg, Massachusetts in his later years. His wife, Elizabeth Crowther, died in September 1962. Crowther died less than a year later in July 1963. Crowther was posthumously inducted into the Brown University Hall of Fame in 1972.

In Ulugh Beg's time, these walls were lined with polished marble. The Ulugh Beg Observatory is an observatory in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Built in the 1420s by the Timurid astronomer Ulugh Beg, it is considered by scholars to have been one of the finest observatories in the Islamic world. Islamic astronomers who worked at the observatory include Al-Kashi, Ali Qushji, and Ulugh Beg himself. The observatory was destroyed in 1449 and rediscovered in 1908. History   Rise and decline  Ulugh Beg's Observatory, also widely known as the Samarquand Observatory, is one of the most important observatories in bringing new discoveries in mathematics and astronomy. Ulugh Beg, the son of ShƒÅhrukh and grandson of sultan Teym≈´r, became the ruler of Samarkand in the 15th century CE. Ulugh Beg was very skilled in mathematics and astronomy. He taught many important astronomers; one example is the famous Ali Qushji. Many historians have tried to accurately identify dates of the events that have occurred during the Samarkand or Ulugh Beg Observatory. The differences in interpreting dates and citations of historical sources have cause inaccuracies and neglection of some events during this time. In Jamashƒ´d al-KƒÅshƒ´‚Äôs letters to Ulugh Beg‚Äôs father, you can see Ulugh Beg‚Äôs visit to the Maragha Observatory had an effect on Ulugh Beg. This could have affected Ulugh Beg‚Äôs reason for his transformation of the city of Samarkand and his mathematical orientation. Other matters such as, political, economic, military, social, and even commercial reasons could have played a role in the building of Ulugh Beg‚Äôs observatory. Another reason of starting his own observatory could have been because of Ulugh Beg‚Äôs differences in observations of those with al-S≈´fƒ´ . The Ulugh Beg Observatory was built somewhere around 824‚Äì1422. Different sources mention different dates; however, many sources mention around 830 to be the date of the observatory‚Äôs foundation and 1422‚Äì1428 to be the period during which the construction of the observatory was completed. Many Old Persian texts include the Samarkand Observatory and the great Ulugh Beg. He invited skillful mathematicians and astronomers to help build this observatory and also a madrassa in Samarkand. Among those he invited were Ghƒ´yƒÅth al-Dƒ´n Jamshid al- Kashi, Mu‚Äôin al-Din al-Kashi, Mu‚Äôin al-Din al-Kashi, Salah al-Din Qadi Zada Rumi, and Ali Qushiji. Over 60 mathematicians and astronomers were invited to the observatory. Jamshid Al-Kashi was appointed as the first director of the observatory. After al-Kashi‚Äôs death Qada Zada became the director of the observatory. After the death of Qadi Zada, Qushji led the observatory as the last and final director. The Samarkand Observatory was a place for astronomers and mathematician to work together in finding new discoveries. Ulugh Beg‚Äôs observatory was built according to the plans of the Maragha observatory, which was designed by Nasir al-din al-Tusi. Ulugh Beg‚Äôs observatory included the largest quadrant principle device. The building was not tall but was allowed a maximal size for the arc of the circle. This device was carefully oriented, and the arc was scaled very accurately. This device was very versatile. It could accurately measure the sun from the horizon, the altitude of a star and other planets. The duration of the year, period of planets, and eclipses were measured by this device. Ulugh Beg‚Äôs measurements of planets closely relate to today‚Äôs measurement, showing us the phenomenal accuracy of the device. People visiting Ulugh Beg's observatory today, can only see the foundations and the buried part of the marble quadrant. Those are the only original vestiges from the observatory. Much of the decline of the observatory could be attributed to Ulugh Beg's assassination by his son, Abd al Latif, in around 1449. Ulugh Beg's death caused chaos within the observatory. The observatory was destroyed and dozens of talented astronomers and mathematicians were driven away. In 1908, the Russian archaeologist Vassily Vyatkin uncovered the remains of the observatory. Scientific atmosphere Jamshid Al-Kashi, a 15th century astronomer and mathematician, is known to have relocated to Samarkand to interact with the scientific processes taking place there. Having received an invitation from Ulugh Beg, Al-Kashi left his native land of Kashan in north central Iran and went to Samarkand. A letter that Al-Kashi wrote to his father during his stay in Samarkand has been translated by Kennedy (1960) and Sayƒ±lƒ± (1960). This letter, written in Persian, has shaped the modern view of Samarkand activities substantially despite its lack of information about scientific activities that were taking place at the observatory. However, a new letter written by Al-Kashi to his father has been found in Iran, and the translation of this letter by Bagheri sheds more light on the scientific atmosphere of Samarkand in particular and reduces the ambiguity of certain elements in the first letter by virtue of their overlapping parts. In the letter, Al-Kashi describes a problem about astrology that he discussed with his colleagues. The translation, ‚Äò‚Äò[Let us suppose that] the Sun is, e.g., in 10 degrees of Aquarius, with a certain altitude, and the ascendent of time is a certain degree [of the ecliptic]; then [the ascendent of the time when] its [i.e., the Sun‚Äôs] altitude [is the maximum altitude of the ecliptic at that moment] is a quadrant [in advance of the Sun‚Äôs position], i.e., in 10 degrees (20) of Taurus\\", reveals that perhaps Samarkand‚Äôs scientific atmosphere was more geared towards astrology than previously believed given Krisciunas‚Äôs paper on the ‚ÄúLegacy of Ulugh Beg‚Äù where astrology has an extremely limited discussion. Astrology, only mentioned once in passing in Krisciunas‚Äôs paper on the scientific atmosphere of Ulugh Beg, was perhaps a more integrated element of the scientific discourse in the Samarkand world given the new, aforementioned letter. Per the letter of Al-Kashi to his father, an innovation was created with Ulugh Beg. The Fakhrƒ± sextant, stood on top of a rock into which some of it was carved, so the edifice would not be tall given the soft bricks of the area. Al-Kashi compares this to Maragha, saying that the sextant is positioned higher there but also notes the flat roof present in Samarkand should facilitate scientific improvement given the fact that ‚Äúinstruments may be placed on it‚Äù. This information, about the sextants in Maragha is contradictory to other sources that state there were no sextants at Maragha. This contradiction was revealed by the translation. Moreover, the scientific atmosphere of Samarkand was one of general isolation because Al-Kashi describes the stout adherence to Ptolemy‚Äôs methodologies and lack of awareness for happenings of the Maragha observatory. The lack of awareness and strict adherence to prior methods by Ulugh Beg himself reveals the perhaps provincial nature of their studies. However, this perceived closed-mindedness was alleviated by the increasing diversity of scientists and students that were invited to the observatory. An evaluation of the errors made in Ptolemy at Samarkand by Shevchenko further confirms the effects of Samarkand‚Äôs initial isolated nature. According to Bageri‚Äôs translation of Al-Kashi‚Äôs letter, a lot of teaching was going on there strictly from memory by teachers who had learned from astronomers in Herat. Moreover, at the time Al-Kashi wrote the letter, three of the teachers were well versed in Islamic jurisprudence: Qazƒ±zada, Maulana Muhammad Khanƒ±, and Maulana Abu‚Äôl-Fath. The letter also states that Ulugh Beg did not show up to teach class often. Maulana Abu‚Äôl-Fath stated that he was intellectually underneath Maulana Muhammad Khanƒ±, who was only occasionally present in the court meetings or observatory meetings, and Qazƒ±zada, who was always practicing his craft. \\"To do them justice, [I must admit that] (30) when there is a discussion in their meeting, I dare not intervene, all the more so because His Majesty knows this art well and [therefore] one cannot impudently claim competence.\\" Ulugh Beg fostered an environment consisting of the some of the best astronomers of the time, and they all observed and calculated the positions of thousands of stars. Ulugh Beg's main work was the Zij-i Sultani.Fazlioglu, I. : The Samarqand Mathematical-Astronomical School: A Basis for Ottoman Philosophy and Science, Journal for the History of Arabic Science 14, 22‚Äì23, 2008. Written in 1437, this work was in Persian, and it was also greatly influenced by Nasir al-Din Tusi. One of the scientists with whom Jamshid al-Kashi would study was Yusuf H. allaj, who had prior experiences in Herat, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and adjacent regions. Yusuf H. allaj was the son of Maulana H. allaj‚Äô, who also resided in Samarkand at the same time Al-Kashi was there. Ulugh Beg was surrounded with other Islamic astronomers such as Ali Qushji, who is considered today as a great Ottoman mathematician and astronomer. It is also noted that music was studied and taught at the observatory. Prosody, music and mathematics seemed to foster the curiosities of the scientists there at the time. However, in the letter by Al-Kashi, he noted that despite his curiosity about music and math, he was urged to focus on his tasks at hand. Ulugh Beg Madrasah was an important centre of astronomical study in Central Asia Modifications and architecture The architecture of Ulugh Beg‚Äôs observatory was different from the others built around that time. Ulugh Beg needed a skilled architect to help him, so he contacted Qazizada-I Rumi and asked him to find a experienced and skilled architects. Qazizada-I Rumi recommenced Kashani, a mathematician and architect. The observatory was modeled after the Maragheh observatory which thought of by Hulagu Khan and Mangu Khan, they hired Nasir al-Din al-Tusi so head the construction of the observatory. Ulugh Beg‚Äôs observatory was built on a hill 21 meters above the ground. The observatory has a cylindrical shaped building with a diameter of 46 meters and a height of 30 to 33 meters, the sextant was in the middle of this cylinder. The building was made of brick, which was readily available but not particularly stable. According to the radius of the sextant the height would have to be so large that it could cause the building to be too tall and could potentially fall. They were able to solve this problem by building half of the sextant underground. This allowed the size of the sextant to be maintained without the height being dangerously tall. The observatory was made up of three stories, the first story was for the staff to live in. All observations were made from the second and third stories, which had many arches to look through. The roof of the observatory was flat, allowing instruments to be utilized on top of the building. The entrance of the observatory has been modified several times in recent years. This is primarily for aesthetic reasons and is not to improve the observatory's accuracy.

A Zij is an astronomical table that is made up of numerical tables and explanations that allow astronomers to compute any problems they encounter. It should provide enough information that they can understand how to measure time and how to compute the positions of planets and stars. The Zij may also contain the proof for the math and theories contained in the tables. Ulugh Beg‚Äôs Zij-I Sultani was published in 1437, it was written in Persian, and listed around 1,000 stars. It follows Ptolemaic work and does not suggest any changes in the planetary model. It has also been called Zij-I Ulugh Beg, Zij-I Jadid-I Sultani, and Zaij-I Gurgani. It is thought that he may have been influenced to create his Zij by Nasir al-Din Tusi, who had written 150 books. Ulugh Beg‚Äôs star catalog was the first to have been published since the Almagest written by Ptolemy. The Zij-I Sultani includes the stars explained in the Almagest, but has more accurate numbers accompanying them. The primary instrument used to obtain the information in the Zij-I Sultani came from Ulugh Beg‚Äôs observatory quadrant. He did not work alone, he was assisted by his students and other Muslim astronomers including Jamshid al-Kashi and Ali Qushji. It took 17 years to compile the full list of stars, they began in 1420 when Ulugh Beg was 26 years old and they finished in 1437. One of the most significant parts of the Zij-I Sultani is Ulugh Beg‚Äôs sine table. The table is 18 pages long and has values of sine to nine decimal places for every degree from zero to 87, it also contains the value of sine to 11 decimal places from 87 to 90 degrees. The Zij was influential and was continuously used until the 19th century and hundreds of copies of the original Persian manuscript exist around the world. It has also been translated into many languages including Arabic, Turkish, and Hebrew. Commentaries by known astronomers like Quishji have also been made. Ulugh Beg determined the length of the tropical year as 365d 5h 49m 15s, which has an error of +25s, making it more accurate than Nicolaus Copernicus' estimate which had an error of +30s. Ulugh Beg also determined the Earth's axial tilt as 23;30,17 degrees in sexagesimal notation, which in decimal notation converts to 23.5047 degrees.L.P.E.A.

Museum Ulug Beg Observatory Museum in 2012 The Ulug Beg Observatory Museum was built in 1970 to commemorate Ulugh Beg. The museum contains reproductions of the Arabic manuscripts Ulug Beg's star charts, the Zij-i Sultani, and of important European printed editions of Ulugh Beg's work. It also contains astrolabes and other instruments as well as a miniature reconstruction of the observatory itself.

Life and career Yates Thompson was the eldest of five sons born to Samuel Henry Thompson, a banker from a leading family of Liverpool, and Elizabeth Yates, the eldest of five daughters of Joseph Brooks Yates, a West India merchant and antiquary. He was educated at Harrow and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won the Porson Prize for Greek verse and was a Cambridge Apostle. After graduation, Yates Thompson was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn but never practiced, choosing instead to travel extensively throughout Europe and the United States, during which time witnessed the Second Battle of Chattanooga. He served as private secretary to Earl Spencer, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, from 1868 until 1873, and stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal for election to the House of Commons from South Lancashire in the 1865 general election, as well as in the 1868 general election and an 1881 by-election. Publisher of the Pall Mall Gazette Two years after his marriage to Elizabeth Smith, the eldest daughter of publisher George Smith, in 1878, Yates Thompson's father-in-law gave him ownership of the Pall Mall Gazette. Previously a Conservative newspaper, Thompson transformed it into a Liberal publication, hiring first John Morley, then Morley's assistant, W. T. Stead, to edit the paper. He supported Stead through the controversy surrounding the editor's famous expos√© of child prostitution, \\"The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon\\" in 1885. Yet Yates Thompson had little interest in the publishing business, and he sold the Pall Mall Gazette for ¬£50,000 to William Waldorf Astor in 1892.Stephen Koss, The Rise of the Political Press in Britain, vol. 1: The Nineteenth Century (Chapel Hill, NC: The University of North Carolina Press, 1981), pgs. 230-1, 322 Manuscript collector St Cuthbert teaching, British Library MS Yates Thompson 26, a manuscript of Bede's prose life of Cuthbert, copied at the priory of Durham Cathedral in the last quarter of the 12th century, with 46 full page miniatures.British Library , Detailed record for Yates Thompson 26, accessed March 8, 2012 Yates Thompson's sale of the Gazette allowed him to spend more time on what had become since the 1870s his primary interest, manuscript collecting. The inheritance of ten medieval manuscripts from his grandfather, Joseph Brooks Yates, in 1855 started what became a lifelong interest in manuscript collection, one that from the 1890s established Yates Thompson as the leading British manuscript collector of his day. He benefited from the dispersal of a number of collections, including those from the libraries of Sir Thomas Phillipps, Firmin Didot, John Ruskin, and the Earl of Ashburnham. He had a prodigious memory, which aided him in combining long- separated volumes and manuscripts into complete sets. Endeavoring to keep his collection manageable, he sold off lesser volumes that he acquired, improving the overall quality of his collection as a consequence.Alan Bell, \\"Thompson, Henry Yates\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, H.C.G. Matthew and Brian Harrison, eds. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), vol. 54, p. 443. His collection was catalogued in 4 volumes between 1898 and 1912 by M.R. James and others. He decided to refine his collection to include 100 manuscripts of the highest quality, and sold off the excess. When he was able to buy a better manuscript thereafter, he would sell one to make way for it. Many of the books that Yates Thompson collected were subsequently donated to museums, including the British Library, BnF and the Fitzwilliam Museum. He died at his London home in 1928; upon his wife's death in 1941 a larger additional collection of illuminated manuscripts was donated to the British Museum and are now in the British Library, where the 52 Yates Thompson Manuscripts from both donations are now one of the \\"closed collections\\".Henry Yates Thompson‚Äôs illuminated manuscripts, British Library - there is much further information on the website The Yates Thompson Manuscripts in the British Library include: *MS 1, F√©camp Bible *MS 2, Ottenbeuren Collectar *MS 3, Dunois Hours *MS 5, Tilliot Hours *MS 13, Taymouth Hours *MS 14, the St Omer Psalter *MS 26, Bede, Life of St. Cuthbert *MS 27, Hours of Yolande of Flanders *MS 36, Dante, illustrated by Giovanni di Paolo Philanthropy A philanthropist, Yates Thompson also donated buildings to Harrow, Sefton Park in Liverpool and Newnham College, Cambridge, and hospitals to Crewe and the Horwich railway works. He received the Freedom of Liverpool in October 1901, in recognition of benefits he had conferred on the city, including the palm houses in Sefton and Stanley parks.

Once carved the body of the instrument, the soundboard is glued and then the bridge, fingerboard and pegs are placed, and, finally, the frets and strings.

A total of 156 teams are competing under to auspices of SCAHA ‚Äî with 37 at the tier level and another 119 at the developmental travel level. There are seven exhibition teams, five for the Lady Ducks and two Select Girls teams.http://www.scaha.com/declarations/2009-10SCAHATeamDeclarations- Website.pdf The teams compete in one of the following playing levels: Mie, Squirt B, Squirt A, PeeWee B, PeeWee A, PeeWee AA, Bantam B, Bantam A, Bantam AA, Midget 16U A, Midget 16U AA, Midget 18U A, Midget 18U AA. 2018-2019 Season Since the 2009‚Äì2010 season, there has been minimal change in Southern California Hockey up until the latest season. Most of the teams from the list below remain in some form still active. With edits to playing rules that have heavily opposed the ones of the Northern California Amateur Hockey Association, SOCAL has had a predominant role in youth California hockey. Some of the changes that have happened in the playing rules and league changes have been caused by the parent organization CAHA (California Amateur Hockey Association) and their parent organization USA Hockey. Most of rule changes since 2010 have involved a further emphasis on cross ice (using only one zone of the three on the ice to play a game of hockey, this is used mostly in the younger age groups) games for the Mite divisions. Also, there have been further divisions made in how they manage players of different skill levels. In 2010, they had some clubs and age groups that would have the AA division as their highest level of hockey. Some clubs, as of this moment only the Jr. Ducks and Jr. Kings, have included the international AAA division for players who are taking a more serious approach to hockey and are aiming at professional play. However, since only two clubs offer this division AAA travel internationally to play other teams and do not compete at the local level. More it terms of being local, the AA division is offered by a handful of clubs in SOCAL and although they also compete internationally, they do it far less than the AAA teams. Instead, they compete at the statewide level against other SOCAL AA teams as well as AA teams from NORCAL (Northern California Amateur Hockey Association). The A and B divisions used to be the only local divisions, in which SOCAL teams only against each other and the same for NORCAL teams. Now, there has been a new division added; BB, which is intended to serve as an intermediary for teams unskilled enough in the A division but are overly skilled for the B divisions. All three of them play weekly local games in their respected division, but the top two teams from NORCAL and top two teams from SOCAL will face off in the CAHA state championships, the only non localized games in these divisions that go on during the season. All of the listed hockey divisions go on tournaments, in which they travel to another location to play teams from other states and occasionally other countries. The prime example of a tournament of teams from different US States and Canadian Provinces is the International Silver Stick. Often, multi rink facilities or separate rinks will host tournaments as well. The most common SOCAL hosted tournaments are located in Riverside, Los Angeles, Anaheim, San Diego, and Valencia. Since these tournaments are either meant for AA or AAA teams, for them it is a part of their regular season. For the A, BB, and B teams, these tournaments are an entirely different form of competition so they usually temporarily merge into the SOCAL league.

The series comprised four programmes respectively titled: \\"Let There Be Light\\"; \\"The Light of Reason\\"; \\"The Stuff of Light\\"; and \\"Light, the Universe and Everything.\\" The material was presented by Cambridge academic Simon Schaffer.http://www.bbc.co.uk BBC Light Fantastic Let There Be Light The first episode shows how the desire, by Greek, Arab and Christian scholars to penetrate the divine nature of light led to modern science's origins. The programme explores the contributions of Empedocles; Euclid; Al Hazen; Roger Bacon; Descartes and Isaac Newton.Let There Be Light 7 August 2006 01:50 BBC Four Greek scholars The nature of light, and how we see, was first investigated by the early Greek philosophers. Light seemed to fill all space while allowing a kind of penetration of the world thus offering a clue to the structure of the whole universe. The world was bathed in light but, to bring it within the world of reason, it was necessary to abstract and choose phenomena where light behaved in a special or strange way: Why do faraway objects appear smaller and why do objects change their position and shape when placed underwater?. Empedocles' idea, that we see objects because light streams out of our eyes and touches them, became the fundamental basis on which mathematicians would construct some of the most important theories on light and vision. Euclid's Optics expanded this idea to make an important breakthrough: We know in our minds that a faraway building is bigger, yet it is possible to position a finger such that our eye tells us they are of similar size. Euclid's elegant solution was that the eye and both the tops of finger and building must lie on the same line ‚Äì thus the rays from the eye must follow straight lines; the new discipline of geometry could thus make predictions and solve problems of light and optics. Al Hazen Al Hazen earned a living selling his copies of Euclid's Geometry before obtaining the patronage of Al Hakim, 6th Fatimid Caliph in Cairo. Al Hazen was unable to fulfill his task of stopping the flooding of the Nile and was imprisoned. Here he noted a problem with Empedocles's theory: having been in darkness and then suddenly exposed to light, his eyes felt intense pain. It seemed improbable that, if rays were indeed emitted by the eye, this would happen; instead Al Hazen postulated that light rays travelled through space in straight lines and entered our eyes by bouncing off objects. He studied refraction and the symmetry of reflection, producing a seven-volume work which became the new standard text. Christian science In the centuries following Al Hazen's death, the Catholic Church determined to demonstrate its Divine authority and produce a \\"Christian\\" knowledge of light. The translation of the work of the Islamic scholars allowed Roger Bacon, in the 13thC, to study and develop Al Hazen's work through experimentation with the distortion and colour effects of light through glass and water The Light of Reason The second episode explores the link between the development of practical tools that manipulate light and the emergence of new ideas. The subject is examined through the work of Tycho Brahe; Galileo; Vermeer; Robert Hooke; William Herschel; Ole R√∏mer; Charles Darwin and Ernest Rutherford.The Light of Reason 8 August 2006 02:00 BBC Four Brahe was granted the island of Hven by Denmark's Frederick II. From here he observed a comet in 1577. Tycho's measurements proved it was further away than supposed thus challenging the Church's traditional view that God had created the Earth at the centre of the Universe.Hodgkinson, Will. G2: Satellite, cable and digital: Pick of the day, The Guardian, 8 Dec 2004 The Stuff of Light The third episode charts the discovery of the true nature of light and the subsequent development of modern technology such as electricity and mobile phones. The pioneers are credited as James Clerk Maxwell; Joseph Swan William Armstrong; Thomas Edison; Wilhelm R√∂ntgen; J. J. Thomson; and Max Planck.The Stuff of Light 9 August 2006 02:00 BBC Four In 1847, as a sixteen- year-old, Maxwell was taken to see one of the minor scientific wonders of the Victorian world: A prism made from a special Icelandic crystal. Light, the Universe and Everything The final episode explores the relationship between light, the eye and the mind and the development of technologies such as photography and cinema. The achievements of John Dalton; Benjamin Thompson; Thomas Young; Lord Rayleigh; Joseph Priestley; Thomas Wedgwood; Eadweard Muybridge; √âtienne-Jules Marey and Albert Einstein are discussed.Light, the Universe and Everything 10 August 2006 02:00 BBC Four From their knowledge of colour blindness, some Victorian scientists believed they could prove the perceived cultural supremacy of the English by measuring differences of colour perception in different races. The idea was that animals were lower down the evolutionary scale but had better attuned senses than humans. If it could be proved that black people had better responses to light and colour this would be evidence of their inferiority. In 1898 William Rivers, together with a group of Cambridge academics, set off for the Torres Straits to prove exactly this. Rivers used a tintometer but found his original hypothesis was false and that the range of \\"colour difference perception\\" of the islanders was little different from that of the English. When Rivers returned to England he spearheaded dissemination of the fact that there was no scientific evidence to support white supremacy. The programme continues and describes Priestley's discovery of photosynthesis. DVD release The series was released as a region 2 DVD in 2014 .

All started when on August 29, 1952 the park \\"November 7 - Fountain Jianu\\" (the ground) was assigned to the Agronomic Institute of Craiova (today part of the University of Craiova) in order to start the creation of the future Botanical Garden. The initial goal was to provide the students of the Faculty of profile (agronomy and horticulture) with training material as needed, especially for the newly created Agronomic Institute of Craiova (1948). Beside the broadening of the scientific base for the researchers and teachers, it also aimed to allow visitors to get in contact with the high variability of the plant world. On March 13, 2002, the College Senate of University of Craiova endorsed the decision to name the Botanical Garden \\"Alexandru Buia\\" as token of appreciation to prof. Buia, all this during the celebration of 50 years of its foundation. Gallery Image:Taxodium_distichum_Craiova.jpgTaxodium distichum (L.) L.C.M.

In addition, the museum boasts the country's largest collection of over 7,000 old wines (ranging from 30 to 90 years in age). The museum's historical hall exhibits items related to vine growing and wine making in the Bulgarian lands from ancient Thracian times until today. The wine cellar offers wines from all Bulgarian regions stored in 100 wine barrels made of French oak. The museum's wine collection is owned by Plamen Petkov, a major local vineyard owner, who has invested over $300,000 in temperature control systems, flooring and lighting for the cave which houses the museum.

History Old building The original school building was opened in 1959 as a junior secondary school and became a six-year comprehensive school in the 1960s. In 2000, with the school in a very poor state and needing repairs, Edinburgh Council decided that the cost of repairing the building was too great, and that creating a new building would be a more viable solution. New building The new school Pupils and staff moved into the new building in August 2003. It is located adjacent to Captain's Road, and to where the old school formerly stood. The functional design has a central hall with classroom wings leading off. The building was created under a public-private partnership (PPP) scheme by Edinburgh Schools Partnership (ESP). Gracemount was one of a number of 21st century school buildings in Edinburgh found to be defective. The schools had all been built by Miller Construction, which was acquired by Galliford Try in 2014. Construction expert Prof John Cole published a damning report into the scandal in 2017. Following this the ESP agreed to pay for all structural repair work (Nov 2018).

Tracy reveals what has been happening to her, so Claire tries to help, only to have Tracy inadvertently freeze her. However, Claire regenerates and they begin talking about how the problem must be psychological and they remark on the difficulty in making friends in the normal world. Tracy tells Claire about her meeting with Samuel Sullivan at the carnival; Claire reveals she's met Samuel as well, and surprisingly encourages her to go there. Later, Tracy contacts Samuel, who is pleased to hear she wishes to join him. Samuel then begins telling her how her powers can be of use to him. Samuel informs Hiro Nakamura that he wishes to have him not save Mohinder Suresh's life as was originally thought, but retrieve a film from Mohinder that he had destroyed shortly before his death. Nine weeks earlier, Mohinder is shown to be living happily in India, reunited with his love Mira. However, he has kept a box of his father Chandra Suresh's research that he had uncovered at Coyote Sands, including the film in question. Mohinder views the video, where his father explains that a boy born at Coyote Sands, revealed to be Samuel, had a certain affinity to powers that could cause his own powers to increase exponentially if surrounded by other people with abilities. Hoping to put a stop to Samuel, Mohinder heads to the carnival where he finds Samuel's then-alive brother Joseph. Joseph reveals he is aware of Samuel's power, having kept watch over him his entire life to prevent him from gaining immense power. He then tells Mohinder to leave, saying he'll keep Samuel in check and telling Mohinder that no one can know about this. Later, Mohinder prepares to burn the film, but just as he is about to, Hiro arrives and stops time, switching out the film for a fake. When Hiro has left, Samuel enters the room and, having overheard the previous conversation between his brother and Mohinder, demands to know what was on the film. Mohinder refuses to tell, and in a fit of rage, Samuel uses his powers to impale Mohinder with sharp rocks. Once Samuel has left, however, Mohinder gets up, as Hiro had outfitted him with a Kevlar vest, having learned of what happened to Mohinder due to arriving too late the first time he tried to reach him. Hiro agrees that Samuel must be stopped, but explains he first needs the film to save his love Charlie Andrews. He then tells Mohinder that he must stay low for eight weeks until he can save Charlie, but Mohinder refuses, intending to prevent Samuel from achieving his ultimate power. Reluctantly, Hiro makes Mohinder disappear by trapping him in a mental institution. Hiro delivers the film to Samuel, who tells him he will be reunited with Charlie soon but he is also unaware Mohinder is still alive. Peter Petrelli escorts Nathan Petrelli, who is still confused over what had happened to him over the past week, to his first day back at work. The Haitian then arrives, informing Peter that Angela Petrelli had sent him to wipe their memories, but instead tells Peter he needs to know the truth and gives him the address of a storage facility. Although the Haitian had only intended Peter to find out, Peter brings Nathan along anyway, and discover a metal casket which contains the apparently embalmed corpse of Nathan. When Nathan touches what appears to be his dead self, bits and pieces of the events surrounding the death of Nathan (as shown in \\"An Invisible Thread\\") come into his mind, including Matt Parkman's attempt to push Sylar's thoughts out of his head and replace them with Nathan's and the real Nathan's death. The brothers decide to find Matt, who they discover is in critical condition and under guard in a Texas hospital. They sneak into Matt's room and Peter heals him, though Matt immediately warns them to leave. Matt tells the brothers the whole story: that the real Nathan is dead and lying in the storage unit as they saw for themselves. Peter seems unconvinced, but Nathan begins to believe him, pointing out that it's the only explanation to his newfound abilities. Sylar then takes control of Matt and attempts to convince Nathan that by touching him he can learn the whole truth; Sylar reveals to Matt that by touching him, he can transfer back to his original body. Peter attempts to keep Nathan away, only to have him flung away by telekinesis, as Nathan wishes to touch him. The guard learns of their presence and enters the room. He grabs Nathan, only to have him brush up against Matt's hand, allowing Sylar's mind to transfer back in, although Nathan remains in control. Nathan then flings the cop into a wall, grabs Peter, and flies them both away to the Grand Canyon. Although Matt is horrified that Sylar has returned to his original body, he is also relieved Sylar has left his, and using his telepathy, Matt sneaks out of the hospital. Nathan is devastated to think that he is really Sylar, while Peter grabs onto him, assuming his flight power, refusing to let Nathan go at it alone. Later, Nathan asks Peter how he can live knowing Nathan is really Sylar. Critical reception Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club rated this episode a C-. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode 8.4 out of 10.

It is smaller than that animal and differs in coloration and in the shape of the incisive foramina, which resembles that seen in N. moerex.Anthony, 1926, p. 5 In his description, Anthony anticipated that O. auriventer would eventually be demoted to a subspecies of Oryzomys albigularis, which was indeed done in the early 1960s. Subsequently, O. auriventer was reinstated as a species separate from, though related to, O. albigularis, and nimbosus was considered to belong to the same species.Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1145 When the members of the Oryzomys albigularis group, including O. auriventer, were transferred to the new genus Nephelomys in 2006, N. nimbosus was recognized as a separate species.

The entire town, aware of the honesty and integrity of the public servants jailed and the injustice being committed, petition the judge to establish a bail amount equivalent to the amount of the alleged embezzlement, and within hours the town had collected the amount necessary to get former mayor Rosich, and a few of his Councilmen released.

The lands were granted by King Edgar of Scotland (ruled 1097‚Äì1107). By the end of the 12th century, the monks of Coldingham had built a chapel dedicated St. Dionysius. The church later received an altar dedicated to the Virgin Mary, with endowments of various acres and rigs in the Lordship of Ayton. The old chapel, which has been extensively altered and renewed over the years up to the 18th century was, originally, a simple rectangular building, but changed to a T shape with the addition of the north aisle. Many of the early Norman features were altered or even removed in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Chapel of St. Dionysius was an important place in medieval Scotland, it played host to several meetings of commissioners from Scotland and England, in their efforts to come to treaty, including those in 1380, 1384 and 1497. The meeting of 1497 involved the Spanish diplomat Pedro de Ayala on behalf of James IV of Scotland with representatives of Henry VII of England, and the outcome was a seven-year truce.

First published in 1946, the story covers the period from 1940 to 1942. Plot In Vichy France, maintaining his cover as a dilettante sympathetic to the Nazis, Lanny insinuates himself among French pro-Nazis Philippe P√©tain and Pierre Laval. Lanny urges Raoul that the French underground should support the capitalist English for now, and return to the class struggle after Hitler is defeated. Back on the Riviera, which is overrun by oblivious vacationers, Beauty wants Lanny to marry the heiress Lizbeth Holdenhurst; she suspects Lanny is in love with Lizbeth's poor cousin, the writer Laurel Creston. Lanny travels to Spain to gather information on Franco and the Nazis' plans to take Gibraltar. Back in London under the bombing, Lanny updates Rick, who observes that the economic masters in all countries fund criminal thugs to eliminate dissent; Rick says England will fight to the end. Irma and Ceddy say the upper class want an accommodation, leaving Hitler to attack Russia. Rick's son Alfy is flying Spitfire planes defending London; the Budd fighter models have gone out of date, he says, and the outlook is uncertain. Lanny says improved Budd fighter planes will be arriving, if the RAF can hold out. Lanny reports to FDR on the English and French collaborationists. In New York, he meets with Nazi operatives, who believe William Randolph Hearst may be willing to back a coup against FDR. Lanny thinks about Lizbeth and Laurel on his way to San Simeon, where he observes the degeneracy of Hollywood; Hearst is cautious. Back in D.C., Lanny helps FDR write his \\"Arsenal of Democracy\\" speech. FDR wants a report on Hitler's plans as to Russia. In Geneva, Monck says the invasion on a 1,100-mile front is imminent. Lanny asks Kurt and Rudolf Hess to get him an appointment with Hitler; meanwhile he goes to Toulon to learn more about the French fleet and to contact the underground. French resistance agents mistake Lanny for a Nazi spy and abduct him, but he buys his way out. In Germany Hitler confirms the plan to invade Russia; he claims Germany will leave the British Empire alone if England settles for peace. They discuss how Germany can support a coup against FDR.

The back row forward played for Cross Keys RFC, Newport RFC and Newport Gwent Dragons before joining Bath. Early life Faletau was born in Tofoa, Tonga, to Tongan international Kuli Faletau, who represented Tonga at the 1999 Rugby World Cup. Kuli moved to Wales in 1997 to join Ebbw Vale. Taulupe attended Pontygof Primary School until 1999 and then Pontnewynydd Primary School until July 2002, then attended Trevethin Community School, then attended Filton College (now part of South Gloucestershire and Stroud College) as part of the college's successful rugby academy and received player of the year during his time at the college. As a young boy, his school friends struggled to pronounce his Tongan name, and so he picked up the nickname Toby. In recent years, he has requested that his rugby squad name be recorded more accurately as Taulupe, but does not mind being called Toby.http://sportlocker.ie/taulupe- faletau-reveals-why-everyone-stopped-calling-him-toby/ Early career Faletau spent his early years in Wales playing for Ebbw Vale RFC and New Panteg RFC juniors alongside Mako and Billy Vunipola until youth level, when he moved to Filton College, Bristol, to experience the English game. Prior to his move across the border, he had suffered several setbacks from both the Gwent District organisation and the Newport Gwent Dragons Regional. Faletau made his debut for the Newport Gwent Dragons senior team, on 1 November 2009, versus Edinburgh. On 22 December 2009, he was named in the Wales under-20 Squad for the 2010 Under-20 Six Nations tournament. In May 2010, he was selected for the Wales Under 20 Squad for the Junior World Cup in Argentina in June 2010. Club career Faletau played a significant role in Newport Gwent Dragons's run to the semi-finals of the 2014‚Äì15 European Rugby Challenge Cup, playing in seven of their eight games during the competition until they were eventually knocked out by Edinburgh. It was confirmed on 9 December 2015 that, after months of speculation, Taulupe would be joining English Premiership side Bath Rugby in time for the 2016‚Äì17 season. International career He was first called up to the Wales senior squad on 1 November 2010 following the withdrawal of Ryan Jones and Rob McCusker. In January 2011, he was included in the Wales squad for the 2011 Six Nations Championship. He made his full international debut for Wales versus the Barbarians on 4 June 2011. In August 2011, he was named in the Wales squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. On 11 September 2011, he made his World Cup debut for Wales against South Africa, scoring his first international try in the second half, adding another in the game against Namibia. He finished the tournament as the top tackler and ball carrier, the first time a single player has ever topped both tables. He was the only player to start all seven of Wales' games. He then appeared in all five matches of Wales' Grand Slam-winning 2012 Six Nations Championship campaign, excelling throughout the championship and making many pundits' team of the tournament. In May 2012, Faletau was announced in the Wales squad for the three test series against Australia, but he had to withdraw from the squad after suffering a broken hand in the first test in Brisbane. Faletau also played all five games in Wales' 2013 Six Nations Championship victory, including the 30‚Äì3 win over England in the final match. In April 2013, Faletau was named in the squad for the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia. After failing to feature in the first two tests, Faletau was named at number 8 in the final test ahead of Jamie Heaslip. The Welshman was impressive, as the Lions beat Australia 41‚Äì16 securing their first test series win since 1997. During the same summer, it was announced that Faletau had signed a new three-year deal to remain at the Dragons region until 2016. Faletau continued to represent Wales in the November 2013 Autumn Series, scoring his third test try against Argentina in a man of the match performance. On 20 January 2014, Faletau was included in the 32-man Wales squad for the 2014 Six Nations Championship. He started all five games and scored a try in a 51‚Äì3 thrashing of Scotland on 15 March, as Wales finished the campaign in 3rd. On 30 May 2014, Faletau was named in the 32-man squad for the mid-year test series against South Africa after playing in a \\"Possibles vs Probables\\" match at the Liberty Stadium, in which he played on the Probables team, which won 55‚Äì7. He started both tests on the tour including the narrow 31‚Äì30-second test defeat, in which Wales lost after conceding a last minute penalty try. On 21 October 2014, Faletau was included in the Wales squad for the 2014 Autumn Series, starting all 4 games including a historic victory over South Africa in the final test on 29 November. Faletau played every minute of Wales' 2015 Six Nations campaign, which included the Round 4 23‚Äì16 victory against Ireland in which Wales made a massive 250 tackles to deny the Irish a grand slam, and the final round 61‚Äì20 thrashing of Italy, which left Ireland needing to win their game against Scotland by 17 points or more to clinch the championship, which they did. Before the game against Italy in the 2015 Six Nations campaign, an email from the Welsh Rugby Union indicated that Faletau wanted to be known by his birth name of Taulupe Faletau. Faletau was selected for the 2015 Rugby World Cup later that year as part of Wales' 31-man squad. Faletau started in the quarter-final against South Africa on 17 October 2015 and was not subbed off, but Wales unluckily lost to South Africa 19-23, being knocked out of the competition. Faletau and his English cousins, Mako and Billy Vunipola, were selected for the British and Irish Lions for their 2017 tour to New Zealand. However, Billy withdrew from the touring squad due to injury, leaving Faletau, as well as his brother to head off on their second Lions tour without him. Vunipola's injury went on to benefit Faletau, as he started the first match on tour, winning Man of the Match against the New Zealand Barbarians on 3 June 2017. Faletau went on to start in wins against the Crusaders and the MƒÅori All Blacks, playing the full 80 minutes in both. Standout performances across the tour allowed Faletau a starting place in all three tests against the All Blacks. On 1 July 2017, Faletau scored the opening try of the second test against the All Blacks in the 59th minute, barging over All Blacks back Israel Dagg to score. Faletau's try inspired a late comeback from the Lions, with both teams down to 14 players, and the Lions went on to make a historic win over the All Blacks that day, beating them 24-21. Faletau finished the 1-1 drawn series without being subbed off for the whole Lions tour and played the most minutes of anyone on tour. On 11 March 2018, in Wales' match against Italy, in the fifth round of the 2018 Six Nations Championship, Faletau was appointed as captain of the Welsh team for the first time in his career, becoming the 131st player to become captain of Wales' international rugby team. This marked a return from injury for Faletau, who played the full 80 minutes as Wales beat Italy 38-14.

It became a standard work for the study of English medieval history. He held the office of historiographer royal from 1708 until his death.  Life  Madox was born in 1666. He applied himself at an early age to the study of the common law, and was admitted to the Middle Temple, though he was never called to the bar. He became a sworn clerk in the Lord Treasurer's remembrance office (i.e. official archives), and afterwards joint clerk in the Augmentation Office, which administered the crown estates; first with Charles Batteley, who died in May 1722, and afterwards with John Batteley.DNB cites Birch MS 4223, fol. 1. There he pursued his historical researches under the patronage of Lord Somers. He made his first appearance as an author with the publication of Formulare Anglicanum in 1702, concerning ancient charters, which Madox introduced with a learned dissertation on the subject. The principal materials for this work were obtained from the archives of the court of augmentations. It is \\"justly\\" (according to the Dictionary of National Biography) described by Bishop William Nicolson as \\"of unspeakable service to our students in law and antiquities\\".DNB cites English Historical Library (1776), pp. 168-9. On the motion of Peter Le Neve, Madox was elected a member of the Society of Antiquaries in January 1708.DNB cites Nichols, Literary Anecdotes, vol. 6, pp. 147, 148. In 1711 he published his History of the Exchequer, with a dedication to the Queen and a long prefatory epistle to Lord Somers, giving an account of his researches among the public records to gather the materials for the work. Madox was subsequently sworn in and admitted to the office of historiographer royal, in succession to Thomas Rymer, on 12 July 1714,DNB cites British Library, Additional MS 4572, fol. 108. with an attached salary of ¬£200 a year. The last of his works Madox saw printed in his lifetime was Firma Burgi, on early records concerning English towns and boroughs, dedicated to George I, published in 1723. Madox died on 13 January 1727, and was buried at Arlesey, Bedfordshire.DNB cites Historical Register (1727), Chron. Diary, p. 6. He was succeeded in the office of historiographer royal by Robert Stephens. A posthumous work, Baronia Anglica, on the history and records of the feudal barons, appeared in 1736. A collection of further transcripts was bequeathed by his widow to the British Museum, as an addition to the Sloane Library. It ran to ninety-four volumes,DNB cites British Library, Additional MSS 4479‚Äì4572. folio and quarto, consisting chiefly of extracts of records from the Exchequer, the Patent and Close Rolls in the Tower, the Cottonian Library, the archives of Canterbury and Westminster, and the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge; all that Madox had transcribed himself, intending them as materials for a Feudal History of England from the earliest times.DNB cites Nichols, Literary Anecdotes, vol. 9, p. 645.

Although Chrysomalus and his writings, the Golden Sermons, had been accused of promoting Bogomil teachings, his association with Bogomilism has been contested by later scholars. At the time of his condemnation, Chrysomalus' works had attained great popularity in the monastery of St. Nicholas in Hieron (likely a naval base on the Bosphoros), where he had only recently died.Hamilton, Janet & Bernard Hamilton (eds.) Christian Dualist Heresies in the Byzantine World, c. 650-c. 1450: Selected Sources. Pages 212-214. Manchester University Press, 1998. The posthumous trial was held at the church of St. Alexius in Constantinople in May 1140 under the authority of the patriarch Leo Styppeiotes, and the record of the trial still exists. Dimitri Obolensky lists the heretical doctrines that the Synod attributed to Chrysomalus: The Synod claimed that Chrysomalus' replacement of the baptism with his own initiatory rite and the concept of two souls were signs of Bogomolism. This is disputed by Obolensky, who notes that the former was not exclusive to Bogomilism and that latter was generally associated elsewhere with Messalianism (a heresy also mentioned by the Synod). Also attributed to Chrysomalus were teachings associated with civil disobedience: that the reverence of worldly rulers is akin to paying homage to Satan and that temporal authority should be denounced. Although this is similar to some practices attributed to the Bogomils by Cosmas the Priest, it is not possible to establish a definite connection.

Her work earned the attention and the admiration of other Italian writers, such as Giorgio Manganelli, Salvatore Quasimodo, and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Merini's writing style has been described as intense, passionate and mystic, and it is influenced by Rainer Maria Rilke. Some of her most dramatic poems concern her time in a mental health institution (from 1964 to 1970). Her 1986 poem The Other Truth. Diary of a Misfit (L'altra verit√†. Diario di una diversa) is considered one of her masterpieces. In 1996 she was nominated by the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 2002 she was made Dame of the Republic. In 2007 she won the Elsa Morante Ragazzi Award with Alda e Io ‚Äì Favole (Alda and Me: Fairytales), a poem written in cooperation with the fable author Sabatino Scia. In the same year she received an honorary degree in Theory of Communication and Languages at the University of Messina.

Her father, Nemo Merini, was an employee working at the insurance company \\"Vecchia Mutua Grandine ed Eguaglianza il Duomo\\". Her mother, Emilia Painelli, was a housewife. Alda was the second daughter of three children, including Anna (born on November 26, 1926), and Ezio (born in January 1943). Her siblings are featured in her poems, albeit thinly disguised. Little is known about her childhood, other than what she wrote in the short autobiographical notes on the occasion of the second edition of the Spagnoletti Anthology: \\"[I was] a sensitive girl, with a rather melancholic character, quite excluded and little understood by my parents but very good in school ... because studying has always been a vital part of my life\\". After graduating from primary school with very high marks, she attended the three- year school-to-work transition programme at the Istituto Laura Solera Mantegazza in via Ariberto in Milan, while trying to be admitted to Liceo Manzoni. However, she did not succeed, as she did not pass the Italian language test. In the same period she took piano lessons, an instrument she especially loved. At the age of fifteen she wrote her first poem. Her school teacher, impressed, brought it to the attention of literary critic Giacinto Spagnoletti, who replied with an enthusiastic critique. When Merini showed Spagnoleti's letter to her father, he thorn it apart, declaring that \\"poetry will never feed you\\" The experience caused a breakdown,Maria Corti in Introduzione di Vuoto d'amore, Einaudi, Torino, 1991, p.VI and in 1947 Merini spent a month in the mental health clinic Villa Turro in Milan. After being discharged, her friend Giorgio Manganelli, whom she had met at the house of Spagnoletti together with Luciano Erba and David Maria Turoldo, tried to help her by recommending her to the psychoanalysts Franco Fornari and Cesare Musatti. Career In 1950 Giacinto Spagnoletti published Merini's work for the first time in Antologia della poesia italiana contemporanea 1909‚Äì1949 (Anthology of Contemporary Italian Poetry 1909‚Äì1949). The selected works were the lyric poems Il gobbo (The Hunch), dated 22 December 1948, and Luce (Light), dated 22 December 1949 and dedicated to Spagnoletti. In 1951, at the suggestion of Eugenio Montale and Maria Luisa Spaziani, the publisher Giovanni Scheiwiller published two of Merini's previously unpublished poems in Poetesse del Novecento (Women Poets from 1900). From 1950 to 1953 Merini developed a professional connection and close friendship with Salvatore Quasimodo. Following a brief relationship with Giorgio Manganelli, on August 9, 1953 she married Ettore Carniti, a bakery owner from Milan. The same year Arturo Schwarz published her first volume of poems entitled La presenza di Orfeo (The Presence of Orpheus). In 1955 she published her second collection of poems, Paura di Dio (Fear of God). It included poems written between 1947 and 1953. It was followed in 1954 by Nozze romane (Roman Wedding) and, in the same year, Bompiani published the prose work La pazza della porta accanto (The Mad Woman from Next Door). In 1955 she gave birth to her first daughter, Emanuela. Merini dedicated the collection of poems Tu sei Pietro (You are Pietro), published by Scheiwiller in 1962, to Pietro De Pascale, the doctor who took care of her child. Merini's pregnancy was followed by a bout of depression, and she spent a period of time in isolation until she was sent to the mental health clinic Paolo Pini. Merini divided her time between her home and the clinic until 1972. She had three more daughters, Flavia, Barbara and Simona,from Maria Corti in op. cit., pag. VIII who ended up being raised in foster families due to Merini's fragile mental health.  The Holy Land  In 1979, Merini started putting together a particularly intense body of work based on her experience at the psychiatric warden. On July 7, 1983, her husband suddenly passed away and Merini, without any support from the literary community, worked hard to get more of her poems published to support herself and her family but to no avail.Maria Corti in op. cit., p.XII However, in 1982, Paolo Mauri,at the time editor of Il cavallo di Troia had offered to publish thirty of her poems, chosen from a typewritten document of about one hundred, on his journal (n. 4, Winter 1982-Spring 1983). In 1984 Scheiwiller republished Merini's forty poems in the collection Terra Santa (Holy Land). Maria Corti called the book \\"a masterpiece\\", and Merini went on to win the Librex Montale Prize.Maria Corti in Introduzione a Alda Merini, Fiore di poesia, 1951‚Äì1997, Einaudi, Torino, p.XI During that time, Merini started a relationship with the poet Michele Pierri, who had been very supportive of her poems during a very difficult time. In October 1983 Alda and Michele got married and moved to Taranto. In the time following her wedding she wrote twenty poems-portraits called La gazza ladra (The Thieving Magpie), later to be released in the volume Vuoto d'amore (Empty Love), together with some works by Pierri. During her time in Taranto she also finished L'altra verit√†. Diario di una diversa (The Other Truth. Diary of a Misfit).  The Other Truth. Diary of a Misfit I couldn't have written anything about the flowers in that moment because I myself had become a flower, I myself had a stem and I myself produced sap. \\\\- Alda Merini, from L'altra verit√†. Diario di una diversa Still from Antonietta De Lillo's documentary Conversation with Alda Merini, 1995 In July 1986, after a brief spell in the psychiatric hospital in Taranto, Merini moved back to Milan and initiated a therapy cycle with the doctor Marcella Rizzo, to whom she dedicated more than a poem. In the same year she started writing again and got newly in touch with Vanni Scheiwiller, who published L'altra verit√†. Diario di una diversa, her first book written in prose that, as Giorgio Manganelli stated in the preface, \\"it is neither a document nor a testimony on the ten years spent by the writer in a mental institution. It is a 'reconnaissance' through epiphanies, deliria, tunes, songs, revelations and apparitions, of a space - not a place - where, failing every habit and everyday perspicacity, the natural hell and the numinuous nature of human being burts out.\\"Giorgio Manganelli in Introduzione a Alda Merini. L'altra verit√†, diario di una diversa. Rizzoli, 1997, p.7. The book was followed by Fogli bianchi (White sheets of paper, 1987), La volpe e il sipario (The Fox and the Curtain, 1997) and Testamento (Testament, 1988). In 1987 she was a finalist for the literary prize Premio Bergamo.  Caff√® sui Navigli  Alda Merini on the way to Caff√© Chimera in Milan, c. 1990 Merini's years in Milan were very productive. During the winter of 1989 she started spending time at the cafe/bookshop Chimera, not far from where she lived, offering typewritten poems to her friends. Chimera proved to be a particularly inspirational setting, and it was there that Merini wrote her next two books, Delirio amoroso (Love Delirium, 1989) and Il tormento delle figure (The Figure's Torment, 1990). In 1991 she published Le parole di Alda Merini (The Words of Alda Merini) and Vuoto d'amore (Empty Love). These were followed by Ipotenusa d'amore (Hypothene of Love, 1992), La palude di Manganelli o il monarca del re (The Manganelli Swamp or the King's Monarch, 1993), Aforismi (Aphorisms, with photographs by Giuliano Grittini, 1993) and Titano amori intorno (Titan's Loves Around, 1993). In 1993 she won the Premio Librex Montale for poetry. The prize significantly elevated her status within the Italian literary community, and Merini was rated together with writers such as Giorgio Caproni, Attilio Bertolucci, Mario Luzi, Andrea Zanzotto and Franco Fortini. In 2007 Alda e Io ‚Äì Favole, written in collaboration with the fable writer Sabatino Scia, won the Elsa Morante Ragazzi prize. On 17 October 2007 Merini received an honorary degree in Theory of Communication and Language at the School of Educational Sciences at the University of Messina, giving a lectio magistralis on the meandering twists and turns of events that constituted her life.  Crime of Life  In 1994, Merini's collection of poems Sogno e Poesia (Dream and Poetry) was published as a special limited edition featuring engravings by twenty contemporary artists. It was followed by Reato di vita: Autobiografia e poesia (Life Crime: Autobiography and Poetry) published by Edizioni Melusine. In 1995 she published La Pazza della porta accanto (The Mad Woman from Next Door) with Bompiani and Ballate non pagate (Unpaid Dances) with Einaudi. The same year Apulian musician Vincenzo Mastropirro put to music some of Merini's verses from Ballate. In 1996 she received the Viareggio Prize for the volume La Vita Facile (The Easy Life). She also put together a small publication for La Vita Felice publishing house made of old and new poems, a confessional diary, a selection of short stories and an interview entitled Un'anima indocile (A Restless Soul). In the same year Merini met the artist Giovanni Bonaldi with whom she formed a genuine and strong friendship. They began to collaborate and in 1997 Girardi published the collection of poems La volpe e il sipario (The Fox and the Curtain) with illustrations by Gianni Casari. In this collection it becomes evident the technical finesse of Merini's improvisational poetry that others would then transcribe. This development in her work led to the composition of shorter texts and simple aphorisms. In November of the same year, Ariete published Curva di fuga (The Vanishing Curve), which Merini presented at Castello Sforzesco in Soncino, where she was presented with the honorary citizenship. In 1997 Bonaldi drew five illustrations for a collection of poems and epigrams of Merini entitled Salmi della gelosia (Psalms of Jealousy), published by Ariete. The same year she was awarded the Procida Prize. Alda Merini: A Woman on Stage In 2009, the documentary Alda Merini: una donna sul palcoscenico (Alda Merini: A Woman on Stage) directed by Cosimo Damiano Damato, was presented on Author's Day at the 66th Venice Film Festival. The film, produced by Angelo Tumminelli for Star Dust International, included portions of Merini's poems read by Mariangela Melato, with cinematography by Giuliano Grittini. Merini and Damato became great friends during the filming and Merini gave him unpublished poems to include in the film. Merini wrote a poem, \\"Una donna sul palcoscenico,\\" specifically for the purpose of including it in the film: One day I lost words/ I came here to tell you this and not because you responded/ I don't love conversations or questions: I noticed that I once sang in a voiceless choir/ I meditated a long time on the silence, and to silence there is no response./ I threw away my poems/ I didn't have paper to write them on./ Then I noticed that strange animals like ancestral beasts in the form of men from asylums were coming close to me/ some of them helped me feel unique, looked at me. / For them, I thought, there were no stoplights, buildings, streets./ This ramshackle place, my mind has found solitude./ Then a saint with something to give arrived/ a saint that was not chained, that was not an evildoer,/ the one thing that I had had during all these years./ I would have followed him / but I forgot how to fall in love./ He came, a saint that illuminated me like a star./ A saint responded to me: why don't you love yourself? My indolence was born./ I no longer see people that hit me, and I no longer visit the nuthouse./ I have died in indolence. The film received positive reviews. Roberta Bottari wrote in Il Messaggero: \\"With a voice that betrays her childlike candor, a smile that illuminates her eyes and the unmistakable fire-red lipstick, Alda Merini abandoned herself to Cosimo Damato. She trusts him, she 'feels' that she will not be betrayed. And while the director stands with the still camera, waiting for a look, a twitch, a word from the woman, she seduces him speaking of poetry, mysticism, philosophy, music, of foolishness poured out in verse, of Christ and passion, without censuring family pain and the experience of the asylum.\\"http://puglialive.net/home/news_det.php?nid=35458  Death  Alda Merini passed away in Milan on November 1, 2009, following a brief illness.

The knot can be tied under tension and will not capsize. Tying The harness knot is essentially one half hitch and one crossing hitch each made by one of the two joined ropes, around the other ropes body. The ends get caught in between the two ropes and these two hitches, at the elliptical eye in the middle of the knot. There are two other variants to this bend: a double harness bend with ends pointing in opposite directions, and a double harness bend with parallel ends i.e. with ends pointing in the same direction. The starting side of one of the hitches has to be different, in order to have the ends approach the elliptical eye in the middle, from the prescribed direction.

The double harness bend is an unfinished Blood knot: The half hitches need to take one or several turns around both ropes before going through the eye in the middle. The double harness bend with parallel ends is an unfinished Reever knot: The ends need to go through the opposite half hitch, to be lined up with its own rope body.

The name probably comes from the use in fixing the saddle on the back of the horse, tightening as soon as the horse that has learned to inhale at first move, exhales. In situations where a more professional quick and secure packing is required, it may be more proper not to tie a harness bend starting with a crossing hitch and locking with a half hitch, but another more reliable combination of loop to tighten in, and hitch to lock with, such as these: * a Packer's knot starting with a figure-eight knot and locking with a half hitch, * a corned beef knot starting with a buntline hitch and locking with a half hitch, * another alternative is starting with a bowline and locking with a sheet bend File:Criollo with Paraguayan horse tack.jpgHarness of leather and blue fabric band File:KropiliBalyaBagi.jpgPackers knot File:Izbar√ßoluBalyaBagi.jpgSheet bend to bowline's loop See also *List of bend knots *List of knots  References   External links  *How to tie Category:Bend knots ","title":"Harness bend"},{"id":"24924433","text":"The Rt Rev Frederick Samuel Baines, DDThe Times, Wednesday, May 29, 1901; pg. 4; Issue 36467; col D University Intelligence.

History The interior of the Pantheon, by Giovanni Paolo Panini.Another view of the interior by Panini (1735), Liechtenstein Museum, Vienna This is a painting from the Grand Tour. Rome has been one of the world's most visited cities for the past two millennia. In the Roman times, Rome was the centre and the most powerful city of Western Civilization, ruling all the Mediterranean, Northern Africa, England and parts of the Middle East. Afterwards, it became one of the most important cities in Christianity, since the pope, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, resided and still lives in Rome. It became a worldwide centre of pilgrimage, and later in the Renaissance, as the city became a major European capital of the arts, education, philosophy and trade, it became an important crossroads for bankers, artists and other people in general. Later, in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, the city was one of the centres of the Grand Tour, when wealthy, young English aristocrats visited the city to learn about ancient Roman culture, art, philosophy and architecture. Towards the 1840s, the first sort of mass-tourism began, and Rome became an extremely popular attraction for not only British people, but for people of all around the world. The number of tourists, however, fell dramatically towards the 1870s, when Rome became a battle-ground for revolutionaries and one of the homes of the Risorgimento, and remained like that except for a brief period in the 1920s. However, since Rome escaped World War II relatively unscathed, unlike Milan or Naples, it became an extremely popular and fashionable city in the 1950s and 60s, when numerous glamorous and exciting films, such as Roman Holiday, Ben Hur and more famously La Dolce Vitahttp://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/222350.html were filmed in the city. Numerous stars, actors, actresses and celebrities, such as Federico Fellini, Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck and Anita Ekberg, lived or stayed in Rome, especially along its elegant and luxurious Via Veneto, where most of the chicest and grandest of all Roman hotels were and still are found. After a brief fall in the number of tourists in the 1980s (due to some terrorist activity led by the Red Brigades and political scandals), the city has now become one of the world's most popular tourist attractions. Most popular tourist attractions Rome's two most popular tourist destinations are the Vatican Museums (with over 4.2 million tourists per year, making them the world's 37th most visited destination) and the Colosseum (with around 4 million tourists a year, making it the world's 39th most popular tourist destination). Other popular sites include St Peter's Basilica, the Forum Romanum, the Pantheon, the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, Via Condotti, Via Veneto, the Capitoline Museums, the Villa Borghese gardens, the Villa Giulia, Piazza Navona, the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, the Piazza del Popolo, the Castel Sant'Angelo, the Campo de' Fiori, the Quirinal Palace, the Lateran Palace and the Palazzo Barberini, to name a few. Districts The city's spacious Piazza Navona The Colosseum interior A view of St. Peter's Square Central Rome Rome can be divided into several districts. The so-called historical center (centro storico) is quite small, only around 4% of the city's area. This is mainly made up of Old Rome and Colosseum, as explained below: * Modern Center‚ÄîWhere the hotels are, as well as shopping and dining galore along the Via Veneto; home to the Quirinale, Trevi fountain, Barberini, Castro Pretorio, and Repubblica areas. * Historic quarter‚Äîthe center of the Roman medieval and Renaissance periods, with several piazzas, cathedrals, the Pantheon, and plenty of laid back dining; includes the Navona, Campo de' Fiori, and the Jewish Ghetto neighborhoods * The Vatican‚Äîthe Papal City State and its endless treasure troves of sights, relics, and museums, as well as the surrounding Italian neighborhood, Vaticano * Colosseum‚Äîthe heart of ancient Rome, the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, the Forum of Augustus, the Forum and Markets of Trajan, the Capitoline and its museums * North Centre‚Äîsituated in the north part of Rome, home to the Villa Borghese, the Spanish Steps, and the elegant neighborhoods of Parioli and Salario * Trastevere‚Äîthe land to the south of the Vatican, on the west bank of the Tiber River, full of narrow cobbled streets and lonely plazas that served as the inspiration for artists such as Giorgio de Chirico, now arguably the center of Rome's artistic life * Aventino- Testaccio‚Äîthere are several restaurants in the area. * Esquilino-San Giovanni‚Äîsouth of Termini, with an indoor market, Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, and the Cathedral of Rome Saint John in Lateran * Nomentano‚ÄîMunicipio III, the neighborhoods \\"behind\\" the train station Outskirts * North‚Äîthe vast suburban neighborhoods to the north of the center (Municipi 4, 15‚Äì20) * South‚Äîhome to extensive suburbs and fascist monumental architecture at EUR as well as catacombs and the Appian Way.(Municipi 5‚Äì13) * Ostia‚ÄîRome's beach resort and the ruins of Ancient Rome's harbour. Transport Plane Rome has two main international airports: * Leonardo da Vinci/Fiumicino International Airport (Rome Fiumicino) ‚Äì Rome's main airport is modern and connected to the center of the city by public transportation. * Ciampino International Airport (Rome Ciampino, ‚Äì Located to the southeast of the capital, this is the city's low-cost airline airport, serving Easyjet, Ryanair and Wizzair flights, among others (see Discount airlines in Europe). This small airport is closer to the city center than Fiumicino but has no direct train connection. =Airport transportation= From Leonardo da Vinci/Fiumicino airport, there are two train lines;Leonardo Express trains and Metropolitan train and COTRAL/Schiaffini operates buses from both airports to the city. Taxis in Rome are white. Train Rome's main railway station is Termini Station. Car The city is ringed by a motorway, the GRA.oieq-p Boat Most cruise ships dock in Civitavecchia, * Grimaldi Lines provides ferry service to/from Barcelona, Tunis, Toulon (France), Porto-Vecchio (Corsica). * Moby provides service to/from Olbia, Sardinia. Now it is possible for modest-sized cruise ships to dock in new Porto di Roma, Ostia, located a few kilometers from Rome and linked by train and metro. Taxi Taxis are the most expensive forms of travel in Rome. Roman taxis within the city walls run on meters. Rome has several taxi cooperatives: * La Capitale * Roma Sud * Cosmos Public transport (ATAC) Most tourists will not need to use public transport. The city centre is walkable and relatively flat. The axis of the city centre is found by getting walking directions on a map, from the Colosseum to the Piazza del Popolo. Most things most people go to see are within several hundred metres of that line. Cars are excluded from most of that area. Tickets for public transport must be bought before boarding (from a 'Tabacchi' or directly at the metro). Tickets for regular ATAC buses, Metro, and trams are the same fares and are compatible with each other. ATAC polices the buses, Metro, and trams for people riding without tickets. Tickets must be validated, on entering the Metro station or on boarding a bus. =Roma Pass= The cost of a Roma pass is 34 euros and entitles holders to free admission to the first two museums and/or archaeological sites visited, full access to the public transport system, reduced tickets and discounts for any other following museums and sites visited, as well as exhibitions, music events, theatrical and dance performances and all other tourist services. There's an alternative pass called OMNIA Vatican and Rome that includes the services provided by Roma Pass, free entry to Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel, fast track entry to St Peter's Basilica and hop-on-hop-off bus tour for 3 days. It costs 95 euros for 3 days. =Bus= Rome has an extensive bus system, which largely coalesces around the major transportation hub of Termini Station. In the historic core of the city, bus routes are largely confined to the main boulevards which transect the medieval and ancient neighborhoods, where roads are far too narrow for buses to access. =Tram= Rome metro network The tram routes mostly skirt the historic center, but there are stops convenient for the Vatican, the Colosseum, and the Trastevere area. =Metro= There are three lines. Line A (red line) runs northwest past the Vatican, and south. Line B (blue line) runs southwest past the Colosseum and northeast, and it center forks into line B1. Line C (green line) runs from the Saint John's Lateran Basilica in the center to the city limits far east. By commuter rail There is a network of suburban rail lines that mostly connect to smaller towns and conurbations of Rome. Problems The poor state of Rome's infrastructure and public services, particularly garbage collection, have come under increasing scrutiny from tourists in recent years. The Guardian described the city as being in a \\"...perennial state of disrepair, from its rubbish-strewn streets, potholes, scrappy parks and medieval buildings marred by graffiti to closed metro stations and buses that either never come or occasionally combust.\\" Waste disposal has been a critical problem for Roman authorities since the closure of the Malagrotta landfill in 2013. In June 2019, an acute heatwave in Rome led to health warnings from the medical community over risk of disease from rotting garbage, vermin, and household pets who come in contact with overflowing bins. The tourist tax of between ‚Ç¨3 and ‚Ç¨7 per head, per night, which is the highest of any city in Europe, has been questioned because it is supposed to support maintenance and city services for tourists and Romans alike. 3 main metro stations were closed for repairs and maintenance as of April 2019: Spagna, Barberini and Repubblica. The latter has been closed since October 2018, after an escalator sped up suddenly and collapsed, injuring 24 people.

It is a version of Empire with numerous gameplay upgrades and a multi-player mode supported via modems. Plot Global Conquest is a strategy game where the object is to discover territories and conquer the world through strategy and management of military and economic resources. The game always involves four opponents, which may be controlled by the computer or human players, and can be played via modem. The world is generated for every game, with the environment composed of oceans, plains, forests, swamps, or mountains, to which the players add units such as infantry, armor, subs, airplanes, battleships, and aircraft carriers. Players start with, and can manufacture, a spy unit that can not only steal secrets but can see with wide- ranging eyes. A player's Comcen is the most powerful piece, and a player is out of the game upon losing the Comcen. A player's collection of cities, also known as burbs, creates units and must then financially support them with money dumped into the treasury each turn. As with Bunten's earlier game M.U.L.E., Global Conquest is designed to balance gameplay between players. Random events are adjusted so that the player in first place is never lucky and the last-place player is never unlucky. Reception In 1992 and 1994 surveys of science fiction games, Computer Gaming World gave Global Conquest four-plus stars out of five, stating that its \\"main strength is modem play coupled with detailed military operations\\". The magazine later named it one of 1992's best wargames. The game was reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #189 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column.

The Lehigh Valley Railroad built the station in 1905 but stopped using the station for passenger service in the 1950s. Later the station was used as a bus terminal and then as a night club. In the 1980s the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places and today it houses the Dinosaur Bar-B-Que restaurant. History Rochester subway postcard. The Lehigh Valley Railroad Station's passenger platforms, service road, and freight terminal are visible Around the turn of the 20th century, the Lehigh Valley Railroad was the last of several railroads to bring passenger service to Rochester. The first passenger terminal was a small wooden depot constructed a few blocks to the south of the later station, near where I-490 passes today. The current station was built in 1905 and consisted of a passenger station and freight terminal. The buildings are located above the Johnson-Seymour mill on the Genesee River and across the river from the site of the former Erie Railroad Depot. The passenger station is a brick, hip-roofed, -story structure with French Renaissance overtones, including \\"two-toned walls, copper gutters and flashing and a red tiled roof.\\" The freight terminal is a 1-story brick structure. Behind the buildings was two tracks and an island platform elevated above the river with the Lehigh Valley tracks heading south along the east side of the river. To the left of the buildings was an elevated service road that led to a bigger Lehigh Valley railyard. Passenger service ended in 1950 with the decline of the railroad which began during the Great Depression and resulted in railroad having to restructure its debt multiple times under the Chandler Acts of 1938‚Äì9.http://gold.mylargescale.com/Scottychaos/rochester/ , a history of rochester new york railroads Note: This includes and Accompanying three photographs Post-train station years After the ending of passenger service, the station briefly served as a bus depot, but it was abandoned completely in 1954. Around the same time, the platform and tracks from the station were demolished and most of the service road was demolished in the 1960s. The buildings became widely known as an eyesore in Rochester, and a refurbishment attempt in the 1970s failed. Local developer Max Farash bought the buildings in 1982 (for one dollar), and a two-year restoration process ensued. In 1985, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. After a few years in the 1990s as a nightclub called Carpe Diem, the buildings now house Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. In 2018, a re-development project on the site of the former Rochester Subway Court Street station and remains of the service road resulted in a luxury high rise being built next door and in one of the footings used to support the station being used to also support a pedestrian walkway called the Genesee Riverway Promenade. From the promenade, one can see the former braces on the station deck that once helped support the train platform and tracks.

CNTs can be functionalized to attain desired properties that can be used in a wide variety of applications. The two main methods of CNT functionalization are covalent and non-covalent modifications. Because of their hydrophobic nature, CNTs tend to agglomerate hindering their dispersion in solvents or viscous polymer melts. The resulting nanotube bundles or aggregates reduce the mechanical performance of the final composite. The surface of CNTs can be modified to reduce the hydrophobicity and improve interfacial adhesion to a bulk polymer through chemical attachment. Chart summarizing options for the chemical modification of carbon nanotubes.  Covalent modification  Covalent modification of carbon nanotubes. Covalent modification attaches a functional group onto the carbon nanotube. The functional groups can be attached onto the side wall or ends of the carbon nanotube. The end caps of the carbon nanotubes have the highest reactivity due to its higher pyrimidization angle and the walls of the carbon nanotubes have lower pyrimidization angles which has lower reactivity. Although covalent modifications are very stable, the bonding process disrupts the sp2 hybridization of the carbon atoms because a œÉ-bond is formed. The disruption of the extended sp2 hybridization typically decreases the conductance of the carbon nanotubes.  Oxidation  The purification and oxidation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been well represented in literature. These processes were essential for low yield production of carbon nanotubes where carbon particles, amorphous carbon particles and coatings comprised a significant percentage of the overall material and are still important for the introduction of surface functional groups. During acid oxidation, the carbon- carbon bonded network of the graphitic layers is broken allowing the introduction of oxygen units in the form of carboxyl, phenolic and lactone groups, which have been extensively exploited for further chemical functionalisation. First studies on oxidation of carbon nanotubes involved a gas-phase reactions with nitric acid vapor in air, which indiscriminately functionalized the carbon nanotubes with carboxylic, carbonyl or hydroxyl groups. In liquid-phase reactions, carbon nanotubes were treated with oxidizing solutions of nitric acid or a combination of nitric and sulfuric acid to the same effect. However, overoxidation may occur causing the carbon nanotube to break up into fragments, which are known as carbonaceous fragments. Xing et al. revealed sonication assisted oxidation, with sulfuric and nitric acid, of carbon nanotubes and produced carbonyl and carboxyl groups. After the oxidation reaction in acidic solution, treatment with hydrogen peroxide limited the damage on the carbon nanotube network. Single- walled carbon nanotubes can be shortened in a scalable manner using oleum (100% H2SO4 with 3% SO3) and nitric acid. The nitric acid cuts carbon nanotubes while the oleum creates a channel. In one type of chemical modification, aniline is oxidized to a diazonium intermediate. After expulsion of nitrogen, it forms a covalent bond as an aryl radical:The oxidizing agent is isoamyl nitrite and because the optimized reaction takes place as a suspension in water it is a so-called on water reaction. On Water Nanotube Functionalization  Esterification/Amidation  Carboxylic groups are used as the precursor for most esterification and amidation reactions. The carboxylic group is converted into an acyl chloride with the use of thionyl or oxalyl chloride which is then reacted with the desired amide, amine, or alcohol. Carbon nanotubes have been deposited on with silver nanoparticles with the aid of amination reactions. Amide functionalized carbon nanotubes have been shown to chelate silver nanoparticles. Carbon nanotubes modified with acyl chloride react readily with highly branched molecules such as poly(amidoamine), which acts as a template for silver ion and later being reduced by formaldehyde. Amino-modified carbon nanotubes can be prepared by reacting ethylenediamine with an acyl chloride functionalized carbon nanotubes.  Halogenation reactions  Carbon nanotubes can be treated with peroxytrifluroacetic acid to give mainly carboxylic acid and trifluroacetic functional groups. The fluorinated carbon nanotubes, through substitution, can be further functionalized with urea, guanidine, thiourea and aminosilane. Using the Hunsdiecker reaction, carbon nanotubes treated with nitric acid can react with iodosobenzenediacetate to iodate carbon nanotubes.  Cycloaddition  Also known are protocols for cycloadditions such as Diels- Alder reactions, 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions of azomethine ylides and azide‚Äìalkyne cycloaddition reactions. One example is a DA reaction assisted by chromium hexacarbonyl and high pressure. The ID/IG ratio for reaction with Danishefsky's diene is 2.6. The most well-known 1,3 cycloaddition reaction involves azomethine ylides reacting with carbon nanotubes, which are of great interest. The addition of a pyrrolidine ring can lead to a variety of functional groups such as second-generation poly(amidoamine) dendrimers, phthalocyanine addends, perfluoroalkylsilane groups, and amino ethyleneglycol groups. The Diels-cycloaddition reaction can occur, especially on fluorinated carbon nanotubes. They are known to undergo Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions with dienes such as 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene, anthracene, and 2-trimethylsiloxyl-1,3-butadiene.  Radical addition  boronic ester (b). Bottom: corresponding models. The modification of carbon nanotubes with aryl diazonium salts was studied first by Tour et al. Due to the harsh conditions needed for the in situ generated diazonium compound, other methods have been explored. Stephenson et al. reported using aniline derivatives with sodium nitrite in 96% sulfuric acid and ammonium persulfate. Price et al. demonstrated that stirring carbon nanotubes in water and treating with anilines and oxidizing agents proved to be a milder reaction. The diazonium chemistry functionalized carbon nanotubes which was used as a precursor to further modifications. Suzuki and Heck coupling reactions were performed on iodophenyl-functionalized carbon nanotubes. Wong et al. demonstrated mild photochemical reactions to silylate the carbon nanotubes with trimethoxysilane and hexaphenyldisilane.  Nucleophilic addition  Hirsch et al. conducted nucleophilic additions with organolithium and organomagnesium compounds onto carbon nanotubes. With further oxidation in air, they were able to create alkyl-modified carbon nanotubes. Hirsch was also able to show the nucleophilic addition of amines by generating lithium amides, leading to amino-modified carbon nanotubes.  Electrophilic addition  Nanotubes can also be alkylated with alkyl halides using lithium or sodium metal and liquid ammonia (Birch reduction conditions). The initial nanotube salt can function as a polymerization initiator and can react with peroxides to form alkoxy functionalized nanotubes The alkyl and hydroxyl modification of carbon nanotubes was demonstrated with the electrophilic addition of alkylhalides by microwave irradiation. Tessonnier et al. modified carbon nanotubes with amino groups by deprotonating with butyl lithium and reacting with amino substitution. Balaban et al. applied Friedel-Crafts acylation to carbon nanotubes with nitrobenzene at 180 ¬∞C along with aluminum chloride.  Non- covalent modifications  Non-covalent modification of carbon nanotubes. Non- covalent modifications utilize van der Waals forces and œÄ-œÄ interactions by adsorption of polynuclear aromatic compounds, surfactants, polymers or biomolecules. Non-covalent modifications do not disrupt the natural configuration of carbon nanotubes with the cost of chemical stability, and is prone to phase separation, dissociation in between two phases, in the solid state.  Polynuclear aromatic compounds  Some common polynuclear aromatic compounds that are functionalized with hydrophilic or hydrophobic moieties are used to solubilize carbon nanotubes into organic or aqueous solvents. Some of these amphiphiles are phenyl, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene and porphyrin systems. The greater œÄ-œÄ stacking of aromatic amphiphiles such as pyrene amphiphiles had the best solubility compared to phenyl amphiphiles with the worse œÄ-œÄ stacking, lead to more solubility in water. These aromatic systems can be modified with amino and carboxylic acid groups prior to functionalizing the carbon nanotubes.  Biomolecules  The interaction between carbon nanotubes and biomolecules has been widely studied because of their potential to be used in biological applications. The modification of the carbon nanotubes with proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids are built with the bottom-up technique. Proteins have high affinity to carbon nanotubes due to their diversity of amino acids being hydrophobic or hydrophilic. Polysaccharides have been successfully been used to modify carbon nanotubes forming stable hybrids. To make carbon nanotubes soluble in water, phospholipids such as lysoglycerophospholipids have been used. The single phospholipid tail wraps around the carbon nanotube, but the double tailed phospholipids did not have the same ability.  œÄ-œÄ stacking and electrostatic interactions  Molecules that have bifunctionality are used to modify the carbon nanotube. One end of the molecule are polyaromatic compounds that interact with the carbon nanotube through œÄ-œÄ stacking. The other end of the same molecule has a functional group such as amino, carboxyl, or thiol. For example, pyrene derivatives and aryl thiols were used as the linkers for various metal nanobeads such as gold, silver and platinum.  Mechanical interlocking  A particular case of non-covalent modification is the formation of rotaxane-like mechanically interlocked derivatives of single- walled nanotubes (SWNTs). In this strategy, the SWNTs are encapsulated by molecular macrocycle(s), which are either formed around them by macrocyclization, or pre-formed and threaded at a later stage. In MINTs (Mechanically Interlocked NanoTubes), the SWNT and organic macrocycle are linked by means of their topology, through a mechanical bond, combining the stability of the covalent strategies -at least one covalent bond must be broken to separate SWNT and macrocycle(s)- with the structural integrity of the classic noncovalent strategies -the C-sp2 network of the SWNT remains intact.  Characterization  A useful tool for the analysis of derivatised nanotubes is Raman spectroscopy which shows a G-band (G for graphite) for the native nanotubes at 1580 cm‚àí1 and a D-band (D for defect) at 1350 cm‚àí1 when the graphite lattice is disrupted with conversion of sp¬≤ to sp¬≥ hybridized carbon. The ratio of both peaks ID/IG is taken as a measure of functionalization. Other tools are UV spectroscopy where pristine nanotubes show distinct Van Hove singularities where functionalized tubes do not, and simple TGA analysis.

Career Kuhn regularly analyzes American politics for networks including BBC and Fox News Channel. Kuhn has served as the chief political writer for CBS, a senior political writer for Politico, and as chief political correspondent for RealClearPolitics. His work has appeared in news outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, Salon, National Review, Washington Monthly, The Atlantic and The Wall Street Journal. Kuhn frequently writes about the white working class in the context of American politics, the male side of the gender gap, and why Democrats struggle to win white voters, particularly blue collar whites. In the Wall Street Journal in 2020, former Senator Jim Webb called Kuhn an \\"unacknowledged prophet\\" because \\"over the past 15 years few writers have covered this realignment\\" of \\"white working people\\" from the Democratic Party to the GOP with \\"the consistency of David Paul Kuhn, whose warnings about the reasons white working people were moving away from the Democrats were largely dismissed by the news media and party elites.\\" The Washington Examiner also called Kuhn \\"prescient about the rise of Trump's coalition.\\" Early in his career, Kuhn reported on the United States for the Tokyo-based Yomiuri Shimbun. During this period, Kuhn covered issues including anthrax, North Korean nuclear negotiations, and the September 11th attacks. He wrote about his experience at the Twin Towers, on September 11, 2001, in the book At Ground Zero.

Public Prosecutor [2009] 5 CLJ 631 was a case heard in the Federal Court of Malaysia. The Federal Court unanimously allowed Lee's appeal against the death sentence because of irregularities in his original trial for drug trafficking in the High Court, and held that the trial judge's behaviour constituted a violation of Article 5 of the Constitution of Malaysia, which provides that no person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty save in accordance with the law. The decision further held that constitutional rights must be read prismatically and in a generous fashion, and not literally. Background Lee Kwan Woh was a painter accused of trafficking 420g of ganja. The High Court in Ipoh found him guilty in 2002 and sentenced Lee to death. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision. Unusually, the High Court had not permitted Lee to make submissions in his defence, instead concluding after the prosecution's submissions that a successful prima facie case had been made, and that Lee was guilty. The trial judge asserted that section 180(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code permitted this. Lee's subsequent appeal to the Federal Court was on the basis that this action violated Article 5(1) of the Federal Constitution, which states that no person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty except in accordance with the law, and that the trial judge had failed to appreciate the evidence in Lee's favour. Decision In a unanimous decision, the Federal Court allowed Lee's appeal. The judgment was written by Federal Justice Gopal Sri Ram. The unanimous judgment held that constitutional rights must be read prismatically and generously, not literally: The Federal Court found that the trial judge's action did constitute a violation of Article 5(1), even though the Constitution makes no express mention of a defendant's right to make submissions at trial, and even though the judge's actions were not technically prohibited by law. The Federal Court also found that the trial judge had been insufficiently critical of the prosecution's evidence, and not paid attention to inconsistencies or errors in them. In light of this, the conviction was unsafe, and the Federal Court ordered Lee set free. References See also * Loh Wai Kong v. Government of Malaysia * Pihak Berkuasa Negeri Sabah v.

The school is based in four large Victorian houses in Hampstead. The school currently has about 580 pupils with just over half boys. History Devonshire House was established in 1989 by Michael Loveridge with his family. Mrs Stephanie Piper was appointed as the headmistress in September 2011 and was previously headmistress of King's House School, Richmond. One of the school's buildings, 69 Fitzjohn's Avenue, was previously the premises of the Queen's House School, an independent day school for girls aged between 9 and 18 established in 1947. The house at 4 Arkwright Road was the former residence of Francis William Topham (1808‚Äì1877), a painter and one of Charles Dickens' illustrators. Operation The school is divided into four age groups. From age 2¬Ω, pupils are taught at the Oak Tree Nursery in Arkwright Road which is rated outstanding or good in all categories in its 2010 OFSTED report. Pre-reception and Reception pupils are taught at 4 Arkwright Road. At 5+, pupils move to the Junior School which is based at 69 Fitzjohn's Avenue. Finally the pupils move at 8+ into the Senior School based at 2 and 6 Arkwright Road. Boys leave at 13+ and girls generally leave the school at age 11+ although they can stay until 13+. The school is noted for the preparation and quality of food. Devonshire House is one of a large number of schools in the area (see list of schools in Hampstead) which has contributed to school-run traffic congestion in Hampstead. The school has intervened and collaborates with the Transport4schools school bus project. Fundraising Devonshire House has raised funds for various charities throughout the past year including over ¬£4,500 for the Haiti earthquake Appeal. Over the past few years funds have been raised for the Royal Free Hospital, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Aplastic Anaemia Trust, The Anaphylaxis Campaign, the Lowes Syndrome Trust, and Hopes and Homes for Children. Since 2008 the school has also supported the Gwalior Children's Hospital Charity in India, targeting ¬£10,000 over two years. This relationship with the Children's Hospital has been renewed in 2010. Other notable fundraising has included ¬£4,500 for the victims of the Asian tsunami and pupils recording music with singer Beverley Craven at AIR Studios in Hampstead. Alumni After finishing at Devonshire House most pupils transfer to London day schools. Over the past five years about half the boys have gone to either Westminster School, University College School, St Paul's School, Highgate School or City of London School. Over the same period about half the girls have transferred to either St Paul's Girls' School, South Hampstead High School, North London Collegiate School, Francis Holland School or the City of London School for Girls. Pupils also progress to boarding schools such as Wycombe Abbey, Winchester College and Eton College. According to the 2007 ISI report, \\"preparation for the transfer to secondary schools is outstanding\\". Over the past five years one in eight senior school offers received have been either a scholarship or an exhibition.

A rough-and-tumble ensues, and Tom discovers to his horror that Annabel has been killed by a flung beanbag chair. In his panic he phones the police as well as his literary agent, Bill. The policeman who appears shortly after turns out to be Tom's old friend from the army, Bert. After giving Bert the details of Annabel's death, Bert assures Tom that no one will believe such a ridiculous story and Tom will be put away for sure. Tom's mother-in-law, Mrs. Cartwright, knocks which results in Bert and Tom stashing Annabel's body in the bathroom. Bert tries to distract Mrs. Cartwright with a funny story but this only results in her laughing herself into a heart attack. Now dealing with two bodies, Tom and Bert become frantic. Bill knocks, responding to Tom's earlier call, and Tom and Bert stash Mrs. Cartwright's body in the bathroom as well. Tom begins to explain but, being a murder mystery playwright, Bill mistakes Tom's story for the plot of his next play. When it's revealed that Tom's story is true to life, Bill becomes frightened and attempts to leave. The nasty landlady, Mrs. Stewart-Dubonnet, knocks and demands Bill move his car. Her horrible attitude begins a row and, after much arguing, Bill shoves her aside to get out the door only to end up knocking her out on the door frame. Bill wanders back and Bert and Tom confirm that she is also now dead. The three men begin to cry as they contemplate their imminent demise at the hands of the law when Tom suggests that perhaps they'll all get to share a cell. The men weep harder as the first act ends. The second act begins with the despondent threesome contemplating their fates. Tom declares he's come up with a story for the police that would place the blame solely on him and relieve Bert and Bill. In order for this plan to work, they must put all the bodies back where they fell. As the men begin arranging the corpses, the Inspector arrives, trying to find out why Bert hasn't come back to the station. Tom, Bert and Bill desperately try to stick to the plan but their story becomes more and more convoluted until they're arguing amongst themselves and the Inspector insists he doesn't believe any of them. Isabel, Mrs. Cartwright's friend, is heard crashing her car into Bill's and Tom pleads with the other three to help him hide the bodies again before Isabel sees them as she is prone to fits of hysteria. She eventually gets in despite the group's protests and finds the bodies. She begins screaming and chasing the men around the house until the Inspector throws open a door, knocks her out, and kills her. Now also guilty of murder, the Inspector cannot turn any of the other men in. The Inspector, Bert, and Bill become more and more incensed at Tom for getting them into the whole mess and are further infuriated by his habit of always saying the wrong thing, essentially talking their way to the gallows. They decide the best course of action is to tie Tom up and come up with a plan that involves dispatching him so he can't get the rest of them into trouble. They argue while a gagged Tom watches helplessly as Annabel's body begins to move and groan. When she is finally revived by having water dumped on her face, Tom and the other's are ecstatic. They begin dumping water on the faces of every \\"dead\\" female in an attempt to revive them. A tied Tom and screaming Anabel pick up where they left off and the play ends as they argue furiously while Annabel helps dump water on everyone's head.

Ausgabe 2, p. 196 After Richard Wagner was forced to leave Munich on 10 December 1865, Prince Paul of Taxis served as a discreet messenger and intermediary between Ludwig and Wagner. Ludwig apparently also toyed with the idea of abdicating in order to follow his hero into exile, but Wagner with the assistance of Taxis dissuaded him from doing so, while both of them stayed incognito at Wagner's Villa in Tribschen in May 1866. Using the alias Friedrich Melloc, Paul travelled again to Tribschen on 6 August 1866, this time, however without Ludwig, obviously to convince Wagner to return to Munich. Paul‚Äôs following letter to Ludwig is dated 7 August 1866: :I have just left the intimate circle of the Dear Friends (i.e. Richard & Cosima Wagner) and have retired to the cosy little room which we shared when we were here together‚Ä¶ Beautiful memory!...He and Frau Vorstal (i.e. Richard & Cosima Wagner) send their deepest greetings. May God protect you and keep you on the Throne. This is their wish and my own, because only then can we achieve our high ideal. The results of my mission are best given verbally, and I believe that you will approve of them‚Ä¶.But now good night, in my thoughts I salute you a thousand times.

Jealous tongues attempted to discredit Paul, and evil and untrue rumours reached Ludwig's ears that Paul lived a frivolous life. Having little malice in his own nature, Ludwig could never get used to it in others and at first he probably took the rumours about Paul at face value.Christopher McIntosh, 1997. Ludwig II of Bavaria: the Swan King. Barnes & Noble, 1997, ¬©1982, New York, 218p. Although Ludwig's feelings for his friend grew deeper and developed into great love, the friendship was so precariously balanced that the slightest tremor of reality threatened to send it plummeting to oblivion. Paul again ‚Äúfaltered‚Äù making a wrong choice, saying the wrong word, displaying too much familiarity on one occasion and not enough affection on another. Trivial in themselves, such incidents preyed upon Ludwig's mind until they became unbearable. Once and for all, he cut Paul out of his life. Apparently the final indiscretion was so trivial that even Paul himself was unaware of it. When he learned of his fall from grace, he sent some agonized letters to the King, but there was to be no response from Ludwig.Greg King, 1996. The mad king : the life and times of Ludwig II of Bavaria. Secaucus, N.J. : Carol Pub. Group, New York, 335p. Paul's letter to Ludwig is undated, but must have been written somewhere about the middle of December 1866: :My own beloved Ludwig! What in the name of all the Saints has your Friedrich done to you? What did he say that no hand, no good night, no Auf Wiedersehen favoured him? How I feel I cannot say, my trembling hand may show you my inner disquiet. I did not intend to hurt you. Forgive me; be good again with me, I fear the worst - I cannot stand this. May my notes climb to you reconcilingly. Amen! Forgive your unhappy Friedrich.Desmond Chapman- Huston, 1990.

After Paul received notice that his parents had tasked the Bavarian police to trace their son in order to convince him to abandon Elise, they moved to Mannheim or Ludwigshafen in August 1867.File No. 1193 (eh. 276/155) of 1867.

Paul's sister Amalie died on 12 February 1867 at the age of 22 and his half-brother, Maximilian Anton Lamoral, the Hereditary Prince of Thurn and Taxis, died on 26 June 1867 at the age of 36. With the annexation of the Free City of Frankfurt am Main - where the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post had its headquarters - by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1866 during the Austro-Prussian war, the era of the Thurn and Taxis family's postal monopoly ended on 1 July 1867 with the handover to Prussia. In 1868, Prince Paul von Thurn und Taxis was forced by his family to marry Elise morganatically, and thereafter was disowned by them, stripped of all his titles, rank and birthrights against an annual pension of 6000 florin.Karl Bosl, 1983.

Known for her diplomatic skills, she tried to reconnect Paul to King Ludwig II and, according to newspaper reports of 1874, Paul was to regain his family name and become the Marshall of the Royal Palace Herrenchiemsee and Master of the Revels to King Ludwig II. However, this was not realized for unknown reasons. From 1874 to 1878, Elise was the prima donna at the municipal theatre of Freiburg im Breisgau.Sylvia Alph√©us, Lothar Jegensdorf 2017.

He had a great influence on Nigerian popular music. Lagos in the 1920s and 1930s was peopled by a mixture of local Yoruba people and returnees from the New World. Together they created a form of music named \\"Palm Wine\\" that combined Yoruba folk music with musical idioms from countries such as Brazil and Cuba. Banjos, guitars, shakers and hand drums supported lilting songs about daily life. J√πj√∫ music was a form of Palm Wine music that originated in the Olowogbowo area of Lagos in the 1920s, in a motor mechanic workshop where \\"area boys\\" used to gather to drink and make music. Tunde King was the leader of this group. Life Abdulrafiu Babatunde King was born in the Saro- dominated Olowogbowo area of Lagos Island on 24 August 1910. He was the son of Ibrahim Sanni King, a member of the minority Muslim Saro community. His father was a chief Native Court clerk at Ilaro, and had lived for some time in Fourah Bay, Sierra Leone. Tunde King attended a local Methodist primary school and the Eko Boys High School. A schoolmate taught him to play guitar, and he became a leading member of a local group of \\"area boys\\" who hung out at a mechanic's shop on West Balogun Street. The group talked, drank beer and sang, accompanied by improvised instruments. By 1929, King had a clerical job and was also working part-time as a singer and guitarist with a trio including guitar, samba and maracas, later changing to tambourine, guitar-banjo. and sekere (shaker). By the mid-1930s he enjoyed considerable success, with several recordings and radio broadcasts, but he still relied on live performances to earn a living, often at private functions. For example, King played at the wake of the prominent doctor Oguntola Sapara in June 1935. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Tunde King joined the Merchant Marines. He returned to Lagos in 1941, then disappeared for the next eleven years. He was rediscovered playing in Francophone ports such as Conakry and Dakar, and returned to Lagos in 1954. He died in the 1980s. Music The guitar-centered J√πj√∫ musical style blends African elements such as the Yoruba talking drum with Western and Afro-Cuban influences. Tunde King says that the name \\"J√πj√∫\\" itself originated when he bought a tambourine from a Salvation Army store, which he gave to his Samba drummer. The drummer developed a flamboyant style that included throwing the tambourine into the air and catching it, which the audience called J√π-j√∫, duplicating the Yoruba word for \\"throw\\" with tonal accent. His trio expanded into a quartet, with King on six-string guitar-banjo and vocals, Ishola Caxton Martins on sekere (gourde rattle), Ahmeed Lamidi George on tambourine and Sanya (\\"Snake\\") Johnson on tomtom and supporting vocals. The members of the band created a moderately-paced ensemble sound that backed up the guitar and vocals with simple harmonic progressions. In the 1930s Nigeria was a British colony. A Nigerian could go so far, but no further, in the government or in business, regardless of ability or qualifications. Tunde King expressed popular feelings in his songs. In \\"Oba Oyinbo\\", he celebrated the ascension of King George VI of Britain, saying with quiet irony \\"We Have a father ... King George is our father ... White man Cameron (the governor) is our father ...\\" In songs that were not recorded, he went further, expressing resentment more explicitly. The song \\"Soja Idunmota\\" describes a monument of a white soldier with a native carrier, whose head is hanging down, saying \\"Cruelly, they forget the common descent of man\\". In the song \\"Eti Joluwe\\" he said that was better for Yorubas to work for themselves than for the government. Recordings The first mass recordings of J√πj√∫ music were made by Parlophone of the EMI group, starting in 1936, released on 78rpm shellac discs. Tundu King released a number of these recordings including \\"Eko Akete\\" and the classic \\"Oba Oyinbo\\" (\\"European King\\"). He was paid only a small amount to record each release, and earned a very small amount from royalties. However, the recordings were essential in establishing his reputation. Other recordings include \\"Sapara ti sajule orun\\", \\"Dunia (Ameda)\\" and \\"Ojuola lojo agan\\". In all, he made over 30 records. Two of his recordings, \\"Oba Oyinbo\\" and \\"Dunia\\" were included on an anthology CD Juju Roots: 1930s-1950s, released by Rounder Records in January 1985. Legacy Tunde King's music influenced his contemporaries, later players such as Akanbi Ege, Ayinde Bakare, Tunde Nightingale and Ojoge Daniel in the 1940s, players in the 1960s such as King Sunny Ad√© and Chief Commander Ebenezer Obey, who introduced electric guitars, 1970s stars such as General Prince Adekunle and continued to have great influence into the 1980s when stars such as Sir Shina Peters and Segun Adewale were playing modern forms of J√πj√∫.

Life Born on 23 June 1691, he was the son of a drayman in Nicholson's brewery in the parish of All Hallows the Great in the City of London, and was sent to the parish school. He was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School on 11 March 1703. He graduated B.A. in 1713 and M.A. in 1717 from Catharine Hall, Cambridge, was made D.D. in 1728, and incorporated at Oxford on 11 July of the same year. He became chaplain of the English factory at Hamburg, where he was highly popular with the merchants, published a paper in German called the Patriot in imitation of The Spectator, and attracted the notice of George II, who offered him preferment in England, if his ministers would leave him any patronage to bestow. In 1736 he was presented to the rectory of St Vedast Foster Lane; he accompanied the king to Hanover at his personal request. His knowledge of German had commended him to the king, who liked him, and refused to quarrel with him for having dined at Cliefden with Frederick, Prince of Wales. He succeeded Francis Lockyer as dean of Peterborough in 1740, in spite of the opposition of the Duke of Newcastle. In 1743 he was nominated to the bishopric of St Asaph, but was immediately transferred to Lincoln, to which he was consecrated at Lambeth on 1 April 1744. He was translated to Salisbury in November 1761 (where he was ex officio the Chancellor of the Order of the Garter), died there on 19 July 1766, and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral. His library was sold in 1767. He left one daughter, married to John Taylor, chancellor of Salisbury. Of his four wives, the first was a niece of Bishop Sherlock. The famous wedding-ring 'posy,' 'If I survive I'll make them five,' is attributed to him. Thomas was the author of sermons published between 1739 and 1756.

It is part of the respiratory mucosa, the mucous membrane lining the respiratory tract. The nasal mucosa is intimately adherent to the periosteum or perichondrium of the nasal conchae.

His father and his brother Carl operated a cellulose factory at B√∏nsdalen until 1889, when the family moved to Kristiania. At some point after the 1899 Kristiania housing bubble burst, Bache-Wig moved to Germany to study engineering. He first attended the West Saxon University of Applied Sciences of Zwickau, and then the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where he took his final exam in 1902. Career In 1906, Bache-Wiig was employed by the Westinghouse Electric Company in Pittsburgh, United States. After that, he was appointed professor in electrical engineering at the newly established Norwegian Institute of Technology, where he stayed until 1916. In 1912‚Äì13, he published papers on the calculation of electrical machines with AC and DC generators. In 1916, he became managing director of Elektrisk Bureau, a manufacturer of telecommunication equipment. He left Elektrisk Bureau for Standard Electric ‚Äì a subsidiary of the International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) ‚Äì in 1926. In 1931, he was appointed director-general of ITT's Germany division, and received also the responsibility for the ITT's operations in Eastern Europe. Four years later, he resigned from the position, in protest against the New York head office intervening in his area of responsibility. During the Quisling regime of German-occupied Norway, Bache-Wiig served in the non- political Administrative Council until September 1940, when it was replaced by the Reichskommissariat Norwegen headed by the Norwegian Nazi Terboven. In this Council, he was the Head of the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Provisioning. In 1944, he succeeded Axel Aubert as managing director of Norsk Hydro. Marriages and death Bache-Wiig married Tordis Nicolaysen (1885‚Äì1934) on 8 December 1906; this marriage ended in divorce. He married Hj√∏rdis Tidemand-Johannessen (1891‚Äì??) on 20 June 1939.

Plot Quincy Johnson (Jerry Trainor) is a barely unemployed adult gamer who lives at home with his parents. Quincy plays video games under the username \\"Q\\" and is renowned in the gaming community for his many awards and world records. Much to Quincy's dismay, his parents decide to sell their house, meaning Quincy will need to find a new place of residence. Quincy decides to try to buy the house from them for $175,000. He plans on getting the money from a tournament for a new video game called \\"Black Hole\\", where the grand prize is $175,000. He discusses the dilemma with his number one fan, Wendell (Amir Talai). While practicing for the tournament, Quincy finds a player named \\"Prodigy\\" whom he cannot defeat. Quincy and Wendell decide to find out who Prodigy really is to secure Quincy's chance of winning the tournament, also because Quincy needs a place to stay. Wendell picks Quincy up and finds out that Prodigy lives nearby. They seek a plan to beat Prodigy while together. When they find Prodigy's house, Quincy discovers that Prodigy is actually a sullen high school girl named Christina Saunders (Jennette McCurdy), (\\"Chris\\" for short), who thinks that he is her mom Tracy's (Janet Varney) internet date. But the plan almost fails when Mr. Johnson, Tracy's real Internet date, arrives, however, Wendell manages to stall him. Quincy decides he will have to go on a date with her, so on his and Tracy's first date, Quincy lies to her, saying that he is a home economics teacher at Chris' school. Tracy tells Chris, in front of Quincy, that if Chris gets any more Fs she will not be allowed to play any video games. The next day, Wendell has set up Quincy to be the home economics teacher at Chris's school. Later, Chris goes to science class and is the first to present her project which Quincy and Wendell had sabotaged the previous night so that she would fail and not be able to play in the tournament. It goes awry and ends up with Chris getting an A+, and she gloats to Quincy about the $175,000 she will win at the tournament. The next day, Quincy asks several boys if any one of them will take Chris to the prom, which is on the same day of the tournament. No one shows any interest and they all leave except Sheldon (Nick Benson) who reveals that he has had an unnoticed crush on Chris. Quincy takes Sheldon to the library and they research pick-up lines on the computer so they can research how to woo Chris. Quincy then tells Sheldon to sign up for the football tryouts. There, Sheldon, a complete nerd, is tackled by a stronger jock and given a massive, humiliating, almost atomic wedgie in front of his crush, Chris. The bully, however, doesn't stop there, dangle Sheldon by the wedgie in front of the entire bleachers full of girls. After a full minute of dangling Sheldon by his briefs, Sheldon's friend convinces the bully to let go of his underpants and drop Sheldon to the floor. Quincy realizes that Chris likes Ash (Jean-Luc Bilodeau). Later on a field trip to a video arcade planned by Quincy, Ash asks Chris to prom much to her delight. Chris, later on, tells Quincy and Tracy that Ash asked her to the prom, and she will be missing the tournament. Quincy assures her there will be more tournaments, and they look on the Internet for some other tournaments, when Chris sees Quincy on a magazine cover about video games. Chris spitefully decides to \\"destroy\\" him at the tournament, even rejecting Ash's prom invitation to do so, just then Tracy appears and asks Quincy to leave after he tells her the truth. After leaving, Wendell tells Quincy that he is also competing in the tournament and kicks Quincy out of his house for choosing Tracy over gaming. The next day they go to the tournament, Quincy, Wendell, and Chris each win in their respective first rounds. Sheldon (going by the name \\"Shell-Shock\\") appears, after having been released from the hospital. Quincy admits to Tracy that he loves her and has feelings for her, but Wendell convinces everyone to think it's \\"smack talk\\", which inadvertently humiliates and embarrasses Tracy in front of everyone and further worsens the rift between Quincy and Tracy. Tracy, however, who knows that is not true, is not sure about what he said. For the final event, Wendell asks Quincy if he'll work with him to destroy Chris and when they win they will share the award fifty-fifty. Quincy doesn't reply and jumps on Prodigy/Chris; leading everyone on that he will destroy her, but then he works with her to destroy Wendell. But in Quincy's final strike, Wendell and Quincy destroy each other. Chris appears to be the winner, but the game is not over. Sheldon/Shell-Shock, thought to have been defeated, gets up and defeats Chris/Prodigy to win the game. Ash appears from the crowd to Chris's surprise. He congratulates her despite not winning and says he intended to spend the evening with her anyway, and that there is still time to go to the prom. Quincy apologizes to and reconciles with Tracy and asks her to the prom, to which she accepts and they dance to \\"Big Night\\" performed by Big Time Rush.

In the early 1920s, he was one of the political leaders of the Slovene and Croatian minority in the Italian-administered Julian March. Together with Engelbert Besednjak, Lavo ƒåermelj and Ivan Marija ƒåok, he was the most influential representative of the Slovene √©migr√©s from the Slovenian Littoral during the 1930s. Next to Leonid Pitamic and Boris Furlan, Vilfan is considered as one of the most important Slovene legal theorists of the first half of the 20th century.  Early career  He was born as Josip Wilfan in a Slovene-speaking upper middle class in Trieste, which was then the largest port of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Italy). His father was a renowned civil engineer. Josip attended a private Slovene language elementary school in Trieste. When he was a teenager, his father moved to the Dalmatian coastal town of Dubrovnik, where Josip finished a Croatian language high school. He studied law at the University of Vienna, graduating in 1901. He moved back to Trieste, initially working as an assistant in the law firm of the Istrian Croatian national liberal politician Matko Laginja, before opening his own law firm. Since his youth, Vilfan was member of the progressive nationalist athletic organization Sokol. In Vienna, he became acquainted with socialist and radical democratic ideals. He was also highly influenced by the social theories of Enlightenment thinkers such as Montesquieu, Lessing, Diderot, as well as by the Scottish enlightenment, Latin classics (mostly Cicero and Seneca), and the constitutional thought of the American founding fathers. Upon returning to Trieste, he became actively involved in the public life of the local Slovene community. He became a regular columnist of the newspaper Edinost, the most important journal of the Slovenes in the Austrian Littoral. In his articles, he attacked Italian irredentism, and called for a peaceful coexistence of nationalities within the Habsburg Monarchy. In Vilfan's view, such coexistence could only be assured on strong local autonomy, a liberal democratic reform of the State, and clearly defined and enforced linguistic rights. According to Vilfan, Trieste should become the example of national tolerance for the whole Empire. Between 1909 and 1917, he was member of the Trieste City Council, representing the United Slavic National List, which was under the undisputed hegemony of the Slovene Liberals. During this time, he tried to find a common ground with the Yugoslav Social Democratic Party. After the outbreak of the Italian Front in May 1915, Wilfan was appointed by the Austro-Hungarian authorities to the Security Council of the City of Trieste, a highly influential auxiliary body, established in order to help the Austrian military authorities to evacuate the city in the case of an Italian occupation. The Security Council was also involved in the creation of a Civic Guard that would fight against possible subversive actions. The activity of the Council was mostly directed against the local Italian irredentist subculture. By the end of the war, this institution was highly unpopular among Trieste's Italian speaking majority.  Under Italian rule  At the end of World War I, when the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy collapsed, Wilfan was in Ljubljana, where he was among the founders of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. At the time, he collaborated closely with several Liberal activists, such as Milko Brezigar and Gregor ≈Ωerjav, in the creation of a unified Liberal party in the Slovene Lands, called Yugoslav Democratic Party. In the meantime, however, Trieste was occupied by the Royal Italian Army. Wilfan strongly supported the annexation of Trieste to Yugoslavia. However, after the Treaty of Rapallo assigned the entire former Austrian Littoral to the Kingdom of Italy, Vilfan argued for a policy of agreement with the new State authorities. Together with Engelbert Besednjak and Virgil ≈†ƒçek, Vilfan emerged as the foremost leader of the Slovene and Croatian national community in the Julian March. In 1921, he was elected to the Italian Parliament. After the rise of Fascism, he became disillusioned and pessimist regarding the possibilities of parliamentary activities. He personally visited the Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini on three occasions (in 1922, 1924, and 1928), in order to persuade him to undertake a more conciliatory policy towards national minorities. By the mid-1920s, Vilfan's policy of collaboration with the authorities and of passive resistance to Fascist Italianization became increasingly challenged by the ranks of his own National Liberal fraction. In 1927, a group of young Slovene left wing nationalists formed the militant anti-fascist organization TIGR. Vilfan himself was a victim of Fascist violence. In 1920, the Fascist squads destroyed his office and family home in Trieste. In 1926, he was placed under arrest during one of his stays in Rome. The following year, he was arrested in Florence, and spent several weeks in prison. In 1928, he decided to flee from Italy, after his last personal meeting with Mussolini turned out as a complete failure.  International minority rights activist  In 1928, Vilfan moved to Vienna, where he became one of the leaders and later the President of the Congress of European Nationalities. During this time, he closely collaborated with the Christian Socialist politician Engelbert Besednjak for the internationalization of the question of South Slavic minorities in Italy. He also wrote several treatises on minority rights and international relations. After the Anschluss in 1939, Vilfan moved from Vienna to Belgrade, where he spent the rest of his life. Between 1945 and 1954, he collaborated with the Yugoslav Communist regime as an expert on the Trieste question. He died in Belgrade in 1955, and was buried in Ljubljana.  Influence and legacy  In the 1920s, Vilfan was a highly influential figure among Slovene liberals, especially in the Slovenian Littoral. Between 1921 and 1928, he was the editor of the journal Pravni vestnik (\\"The Legal Herald\\"), which was one of the most important journals for legal theory in South Slavic languages. The legal theorist Boris Furlan was the most renowned of Vilfan's collaborators. In the 1930s, Vilfan's positions towards the minority question came under severe criticism by the more radical exponents of the Slovene minority in Italy, especially by the emigre circles in Yugoslavia around Lavo ƒåermelj and Ivan Marija ƒåok, who opted for a \\"territorial solution\\", that is the annexation of Istria, Trieste and the Slovenian Littoral to Yugoslavia. His views were also rejected by the militant organization TIGR, which adopted a strategy of violent confrontation with the Fascist regime. During World War II, his positions were publicly rejected by the Communist-led Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. A street in Piran and one in Nova Gorica have been named after him.  Family life  Vilfan came from an influential family of Trieste Slovenes. His nephew Sergij Vilfan was a renowned historian. His son Dra≈°ko Vilfan became a famous physician. His son Jo≈æa Vilfan became a Communist activist, and later an influential Yugoslav diplomat. His grandson Jernej Vilfan is a novelist and essayist.

He is \\"considered one of the most influential forces in journalism\\" in Blackford County, and was a strong supporter of the Democratic Party. Serving as publisher and sometimes as editor of his newspaper, he also spent time as chairman of the eleventh congressional district, county chairman of the Democratic Party, member of the school board, and postmaster. His newspapers were a \\"voice\\" for the Democratic Party for nearly 40 years.See page 4 article by T.J. Hemlinger in the December 30, 1985 Centennial Tabloid edition of the Hartford City News-Times. The Hemlinger article includes the quote \\"considered one of the most influential forces....\\"Stoll's History of the Indiana Democracy...., pages 75-76 of the e-book version (scroll down).Roll's biography for Edward E. Cox in Indiana One Hundred and Fifty Years of American Development Volume 5. A portion of this book has been reproduced in the Indiana State web page biography for Edward E. Cox. Identity and origins The Cox family came to America when the land was still a British colony, and Edward Cox is a descendant of an American Revolutionary War soldier that served with South Carolina troops. The Cox clan from which Edward was descended was a group of Quakers living in North Carolina. During the Revolutionary War, Edward's great-great grandfather was part of a group known as the \\"Fighting Quakers\\", and was a friend of General Nathanael Greene.Stoll's History of the Indiana Democracy contains Cox family information in a biography of Edward Cox's uncle (Judge Charles E. Cox) on page 134 of e-book (scroll down) Edward Cox's grandfather, Aaron Cox, was an Ohio farmer that moved to Hamilton County, Indiana in 1850. In addition to his farm, Aaron Cox was a postmaster and contractor. Bodurtha‚Äôs History of Miami County, Indiana...., page 814. Judge Cox Edward Cox's father, Jabez Thomas Cox, was four years old when the family moved to Indiana. Jabez was teaching school by the time he was 16 years old, and he began studying law shortly thereafter. He served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, keeping a diary that was later published.\\"Civil War Diary of Jabez T. Cox\\" in the Indiana magazine of history, Volume 28, page 40. After being admitted to the bar, he began practicing law during the late 1860s in Tipton, Indiana, and many years later (1890 and 1896) was elected judge of the Miami circuit court.History of Miami County, Indiana: From the earliest time...., page 409. Jabez Cox had two brothers that would also become judges.Monks, Esarey, and Shockley's Courts and Lawyers of Indiana, pages 287-288. One brother was Millard Fillmore Cox, who was named after the thirteenth President of the United States.Trissal's Public Men of Indiana, page 225. Millard Fillmore Cox became a Marion County criminal court judge in Indiana, and also wrote editorials for the Indianapolis Sentinel. Another brother, Charles E. Cox, became an Indiana Supreme Court justice in 1911.Trissal, pages 225-226. Family Jabez Cox married Jennie Price and fathered three children. His first child was named Edward Everett Cox, and Edward was born on December 29, 1867, in Tipton, Indiana.The birth year could possibly be 1868. Roll and Cox's gravestone say 1867. The 1870 U.S. Census says he was 2 on his birthday before August 1870, agreeing with December 29, 1867. Shinn (p. 528) says 1868, as does Hartford City Illustrated and the Hartford City News Cox obituary. The U.S. Census for 1930 implies that Cox's birth year is 1868, saying he was 61 years old on April 12, 1930. While it is not known for certain, Jabez probably named his son after Edward Everett ‚Äì the noted speaker, prominent politician, and former member of the Whig political party. This seems especially probable since Millard Fillmore Cox had been named after the last President of the United States to be a member of the Whig Party.Shinn's Blackford County Indiana...., page 528. Ironically, the Cox family became strong supporters of the Democratic Party as the Whig party became irrelevant in the 1850s. In 1869, the family moved to Frankfort, Indiana, and Jabez Cox became proprietor and editor of the Frankfort Crescent newspaper.History of Clinton County, Indiana, page 397. In February 1872, Jabez Cox sold his newspaper company and moved back to Tipton and resumed practicing law. Edward Cox attended the local schools until 1875 when the family moved to Kansas. The move to a western climate was an attempt to improve the failing health of Edward's mother. Continuing to practice law, Jabez Cox also became more active in politics, and lost a Kansas election for state attorney general as a member of the Democratic Party.A portion of Blanchard's biography of Jabez T. Cox from Counties of Howard and Tipton, Indiana has been reprinted in the Tipton- Hamilton-Clinton County IN Archives Biographies listed on rootsweb web page biography for Jabez Cox. Edward's mother (Jennie Price Cox) continued to have poor health, and the family moved to Colorado in 1879 because of her physical condition. She died in 1882 in Canon City, Colorado.Canon City, Colorado exists today, and may be confused with Canyon City ‚Äî which does not exist in Colorado. Bodurtha, on page 815, says Jennie Price Cox died in Canyon City, Colorado. However, Blanchard says the family lived in Canon City, Colorado. In 1883, the family returned to Indiana and settled in the city of Peru, which is about north of the earlier Cox residence in Tipton. After high school in Peru, Edward Cox attended Purdue University. Teaching and journalism Edward Cox began his post-scholastic career as a teacher (similar to his father's first occupation) in the Peru area's Miami County school district. After three years, he resigned his position as an educator to start a career in journalism, becoming a reporter for the local Miami County Sentinel newspaper.The Library of Congress lists the Sentinel. Several sources mention Cox working for the Sentinel, including Roll in his Edward E. Cox biography available in the Indiana State Library web page. The newspaper business was another occupation in which Edward's father had also been involved. Edward's family continued its involvement in politics as Edward's father, Jabez Cox, won a seat in the Indiana state legislature in 1886. Edward Cox started Peru's Daily Herald newspaper in 1887, but it lasted only three months before it was suspended. Bodurtha, p. 301 (bottom of page) Cox continued his journalism career in Peru as a reporter until 1891, when he moved to Hartford City, Indiana.Shinn, page 531. Telegram E. E. Cox, circa 1895. In the spring of 1891, young Edward Cox purchased the Telegram, a weekly newspaper in Hartford City, Indiana. The purchase was made with the financial assistance of a second investor. Thus, Cox began a long career as a newspaper publisher and editor. The Telegram's printing facilities were located in the back room of a drugstore, with about of space. Initially, Cox used a Washington Hand Press to produce his newspaper.The International Printing Museum describes this printing technology. The Washington Hand Press was roughly 70-year-old technology, and it took all day for him to print an edition, even with his newspaper's small circulation. Other related equipment was also crude. This was also a significant year in Cox's personal life, as he married Eldora \\"Dora\\" Sites in September.Shinn, page 531, has the exact wedding date and location. In about one year, Cox replaced all of his printing equipment, and began using a cylinder press, which was a more modern piece of equipment. After a total of three years of printing, he upgraded to a press powered by a steam engine, and added other equipment that was the latest in newspaper technology. His newspaper equipment was far more advanced than that typical of a city of Hartford City's size. The advanced equipment enabled him to also operate a printing business. By 1894, the Telegram had about 1,200 subscribers.From a February 8, 1894 edition of the Upland Monitor as reproduced in the Gas Belt Review on page 5 column 1, published by the Blackford County Historical Society. Hartford City's population ranged from 2,287 in 1890 to 5,912 in 1900, so 1,200 subscribers can be considered very successful.Moore's Hoosier Cyclopedia, page 22. An advertisement in an 1895 Hartford City directory said the Telegram was Democratic and the leading newspaper of Blackford County. The paper was issued every Wednesday.See 167th page of PDF of Columbia Directory Company's 1895 version of the Hartford City, Montpelier, and Blackford County, Indiana Directory. Evening News Because of the success of the Telegram, Cox began Blackford County's first daily newspaper, the Evening News (a.k.a. Hartford City Evening News). The first edition was published on February 5, 1894, and it was distributed free for the first week. Subscriptions were available with delivery to all parts of Hartford City for 10 cents per week.From the February 5, 1894 edition of the Evening News as reproduced on page 4, column 4, of the Gas Belt Review published by the Blackford County Historical Society. There is some disagreement among sources for the starting date for this newspaper. The Cox obituary in the Hartford City News (\\"City Shocked by the Death of Publisher Following a Series of Heart Attacks\\") said 1893 was the startup year, as did Hartford City Illustrated on page 10. Hemlinger's article on page 5 in the Hartford City News-Times Centennial Tabloid says 1892 is the start date. The American Newspaper Directory for March 1900 lists the start year for the Evening News as 1894. An advertisement in an 1895 city directory described the Evening News as non-political and possessing a \\"well equipped job office\\". Hartford City News By 1900, the Evening News was no longer non- political, and was considered the voice of the Democratic Party.Hemlinger, p. 4. Cox became known for his editorials, and the demands of the Evening News‚Äô success caused Cox to discontinue the Telegram in 1914. Eventually, the \\"Evening\\" portion of the Evening News name was dropped, and the newspaper became known as the Hartford City News.An e-mail from the Indiana State Library says that by 1918 the newspaper was called the Hartford City News. Because the newspaper was a daily, one source incorrectly calls the newspaper the Hartford City Daily News.Roll's biography for Edward E. Cox calls the newspaper the Hartford City Daily News. The Indiana State Library newspaper collection for Blackford County lists the Evening News and the Hartford City News. In the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan began gaining political power within Hartford City, bringing intolerance toward the city's Catholic, black, and Jewish citizens. Both local newspapers, the Hartford City News and the Times- Gazette, provided strong opposition to the Klan's philosophy. Cox's anti-Klan editorials irritated Klan organizer L. J. King enough that he referred to the Hartford City News as \\"that Catholic rag\\". Ironically, Cox was not Catholic.See pages 25 and 26 of \\"A History of Blackford County, Indiana...\\" During 1925, Indiana Klan leader D. C. Stephenson was convicted for the murder of Madge Oberholtzer in a Noblesville, Indiana, trial that received national attention. Cox's uncle, Charles E. Cox was one of the prosecutors in the trial. Details of the case caused many Klan members to abandon the organization. By the end of 1926, the Ku Klux Klan lost its power locally and within the state. The Hartford City News continued its journalistic excellence, and became known as \\"one of the best and most influential daily papers in this section of the state.\\" Cox Remarries Tragedy struck the Cox family in 1898. Edward Cox's wife Dora died from pneumonia while visiting Edward's uncle (Millard Fillmore Cox) in Indianapolis. The family had two young daughters, aged five and seven years, at the time. Cox maintained a Hartford City residence on Jefferson Street, an easy walk to his newspaper business located on the same street, and raised his daughters for several years with the assistance of hired help.The 1900 U.S. census lists Edward E. Cox as living with his two daughters plus a nurse and a servant. Cox remarried in 1901. Married twice in one week Cox, the newsman, made the news himself when he married twice in one week. His bride-to-be was Miss Nellie Victor Tozier, sister of news editor Albert E. Tozier. Although Nellie and Albert Tozier lived in Oregon, their politician father (Charles T. Tozier) was born in Indiana. Albert Tozier had been president of the National Editorial Association, and it was at the Association's meetings that the couple-to-be met. Thus, the couple-to-be had newspapers, politics, and Indiana in common. The wedding was to be held in Portland, Oregon, and Nellie Tozier was considered \\"one of Oregon's most popular young women.\\"\\"This Happy Couple is Going to be Married Again\\", The Morning Oregonian, November 22, 1901. A few days before the wedding, the local county clerk died. Therefore, the couple's marriage license was issued by a deputy clerk. The wedding was held in the First Baptist Church of Portland, on November 18, 1901. Shortly after the wedding, the newlyweds began their journey east to Hartford City, Indiana. A major portion of their trip was via a Northern Pacific train to Chicago. Mr. and Mrs. Cox traveled as far as Spokane when they discovered that lawyers were debating the validity of all marriage licenses issued by the deputy clerk. An old Oregon law declared that only county clerks could issue marriage licenses, and this meant that the marriage licenses issued by the deputy clerk could be invalid. The couple continued their eastward journey, as most law experts believed their marriage license was legal. As the newly-wedded couple reached St. Paul, they received a telegram from the bride's mother that expressed concerns about the validity of their marriage.\\"Twice Married in Five Days\\", Peru Daily Chronicle, November 30, 1901. Adding to the complexity of the problem, Indiana law required residency for 30 days before marriage, so a wedding in Indiana could not be performed in the near future.\\"Two Ceremonies\\", The Marion Daily Leader, November 29, 1901. Therefore, the couple wed again, in Chicago, in a ceremony performed by a judge. The bride's sister served as witness.\\"The Experiences of Ed Cox\\", Peru Evening Journal, November 30, 1901. The couple then had two marriage certificates, and they were the subject of news throughout the country. This marriage produced two sons and three daughters. Of Cox's total of seven children, three daughters and both sons attended college. The Cox building In addition to using the latest printing technology, Cox also erected a two-story building used as the newspaper's office and printing facility. Local (Hartford City) architect P. J. Loney prepared plans for the brick building in 1895. Located at the corner of Jefferson and Franklin Streets, the building's layout was designed especially for the newspaper business.Architect mentioned on page 10, column 4, of reprinted article dated May 29, 1895 in Gas Belt Review, by the Blackford County Historical Society. In final form, the building was a two- story, 40 by brick building with offices, an elevator, a loading dock, and an additional alleyway entrance. The address of the building was 217 N. Jefferson Street. The \\"Cox Building\\" was used by three newspapers continuously into the 1960s: the Telegram, the Hartford City News, (originally known as the Evening News) and later the Hartford City News-Times. Offices were located in the front of the building (Jefferson Street), and a dock was located on the building's Franklin Street side. The building could also be accessed from the alley behind the building, and that passageway was partially covered to enable paper to remain dry during loading and unloading in wet weather. In addition to the newspapers, Cox used his building for his printing business. Both enterprises were part of his company, Edward E. Cox Printer, Incorporated. The modern printing equipment enabled Cox to print color labels and wrappers made of glassine and cellophane. Printing products were shipped all over the United States. Franklin Street dock side of Hartford City's Cox Building The Cox building lasted over 100 years ‚Äîit was demolished April 26, 2016. The building was part of Hartford City's Courthouse Square Historic District. The photo herein displays the Cox Building from the Franklin Street dock side. The front (Jefferson Street) entrance is to the left in the photo. Hartford City's two buildings that are part of the National Register of Historic Places are located close by. The back of the First Presbyterian Church is visible on the right side of the photo to the right of the alley, and the Blackford County Courthouse steeple can be seen at the top of the photo to the left of the Cox Building's smokestack. Although the Hartford City News-Times moved out of the Cox Building in the 1960s, the building was used by other businesses. A large portion of the building was used in the 1970s by a company partly owned by one of Cox's grandsons. The company was called Phylpat, Incorporated.Phylpat is discussed on page 20 of a 1976 edition of the Indiana Motor Truck Association's journal known as The Fifth Wheel. Instead of printing on paper as Cox had, Phylpat (eventually renamed Cutting Inc.) was involved in cutting paper to make small rolls of adding machine paper. The paper cutting and winding operations were contained within the building, and there was room for inventories of raw materials and finished product. The process used to cut and roll (or wind) paper was patented by Phylpat and one of its engineers in 1976.United States Patent Office No. 3,944,150, patented March 16, 1976. In more recent years, the building was used by a small furniture manufacturing company, and one of the offices had been used by an attorney.Jefferson Franklin Company wss been listed on websites as a maker of furniture located at 217 N. Jefferson in Hartford City, Indiana.Dean Young Attorney was also listed on a website with an address of 217 N. Jefferson Street in Hartford City, Indiana. Politics and community 180px Like his father and grandfather, Edward Cox was a strong supporter of the Democratic Party. His views were typically expressed via editorials in his newspapers, and some editorials were reprinted by other publications. He was Blackford County's Democratic County Chairman in 1902. In July, 1914, under the administration of President Woodrow Wilson, Cox was appointed postmaster of Hartford City, and he was reappointed in 1919. (Edward's grandfather, Aaron Cox, had also been a postmaster.) For eight years, Cox was the representative of the Eleventh Congressional District on the Indiana Democratic state committee. He was also president of the Indiana Democratic Editorial Association in 1927.Cox's front- page obituary \\"City Shocked by the Death of Publisher Following a Series of Heart Attacks Wednesday\\" beginning page 1 of the April 1, 1931 edition of the Hartford City News. Mr. Cox always participated in community affairs and was a member of numerous local organizations. He was one of the organizers of the local Kiwanis Club, and served as its first president. He was a Freemason, a member of the Mystic Shrine, and a member of the Knights of Pythias. He was also a Past Exalted Ruler of the Elks' lodge. In addition to civic organizations, Cox was a member of the local Chamber of Commerce and one of its founders. He was a director of the Citizens State Bank of Hartford City, and served three terms on the local school board. During World War I, he was involved with patriotic activities such as the Thrift Savings Stamp campaign and the sale of government war bonds.Greenough's The War Purse of Indiana..., page 232. Mr. Cox was a strong follower of local sports teams, and attended almost every home game of the local high school basketball team. He was president of the Hartford City Gymnasium Holding Company that raised funds to build a new gym for the school. He was also one of the organizers and founders of the Blackford Golf Club. Death E.E. Cox's grave in Hartford City's IOOF cemetery On the morning of April 1, 1931, Edward Everett Cox died from a severe heart attack suffered the night before. He had been ill for almost a week, but his illness had been kept quiet because it was thought he would recover. The town was surprised by a front page obituary in the Hartford City News that covered most of the page. Cox was considered one of the community's most well-known citizens, and had yet to reach retirement age at the time of his death. He was renowned not only within the community, but also statewide in politics. An obituary printed in nearby Kokomo, Indiana, described him as \\"prominent in Democratic state politics\\".See \\"Hoosier Editor Dies\\" on page 7 of the April 1, 1931 edition of the Kokomo Tribune. In addition to his numerous accomplishments, his Hartford City obituary also described the man. It said, \\"Mr. Cox was a man of energy and a tireless worker. Success crowned nearly each adventure, whether from a business or political angle and he was held in the highest regard and esteem by all who knew him. To his newspaper and his printing business, he devoted much of his time and was beloved and admired by each and everyone of his employees. There were few who were not aided by his hand and direction, and each in turn sought to give to him the best that was available.\\" Notes References   * * Category:1867 births Category:1931 deaths Category:19th-century American newspaper publishers (people) Category:American newspaper publishers (people) Category:People from Tipton, Indiana Category:People from Hartford City, Indiana Category:Indiana Democrats Category:American Episcopalians Category:People from Miami County, Indiana Category:People from Frankfort, Indiana Category:School board members in Indiana ","title":"Edward Everett Cox"},{"id":"24925114","text":"Prophecy of the Shadow is a 1992 fantasy role-playing video game developed by Strategic Simulations for MS-DOS.
