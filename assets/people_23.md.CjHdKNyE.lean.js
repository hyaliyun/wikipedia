Frost refers to two cases heard by the Supreme Court of the United States, both dealing with the regulatory authority of the National Park Service over lands in Alaska under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA).Codified at . In the first case, Sturgeon v. Frost I, 577 U.S. ___ (2016), the Court ruled that the Park Service may only regulate \\"public\\" lands in Alaska, remanding the case back to the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court to decide whether the river in question (being \\"submerged land\\") is \\"public\\" or \\"non-public\\" land., slip op. at 12‚Äì15 (2016). In Sturgeon v. Frost II, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), the Court unanimously ruled that ANILCA defines navigable waters in Alaska as \\"non-public\\" lands and that these are exempt from the National Park Service's national regulations.. Background In establishing Alaska as a state, the United States government recognized the need to protect much of the land in the state but without superseding the state's own control of these lands. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, passed in 1980, was designed to balance the federal and state interest in conservation. Effectively, the law designed a number of Conservation System Units (CSU)s that were designed as public land, and gave the National Park Service (NPS) the authority to manage the resources within the public lands within a CSU, and could not regulate non-public lands (including those owned by the state, tribes, and private parties). Such resources were read to include water resources within a public CSU. This was atop a law signed by President Jimmy Carter in 1976 that gave the Department of the Interior and through the NPS the authority to regulate conduct of navigable waters within federally designated national parks. The case arose in 2007 when Alaskan hunter John Sturgeon was informed by the National Park Service that he could not pilot his hovercraft along the portion of the Nation River that fell within the Yukon‚ÄìCharley Rivers National Preserve, one of the CSUs covered by ANILCA.Sturgeon, slip op. at 1‚Äì6. While Alaska state law allows for the use of hovercraft in navigable waters, the NPS had banned their use nationwide in public lands. Sturgeon filed a lawsuit in which he argued that section 103(c) of the ANILCA restricted the National Park Service's jurisdiction over portions of the river that were owned by the State of Alaska.Sturgeon, slip op. at 1‚Äì2, 6‚Äì7. Sturgeon was backed by the state of Alaska, since the ruling affected how the state could enforce ANILCA. The United States District Court for the District of Alaska ruled in favor of the Park Service, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Ninth Circuit held that National Park Service regulations \\"applies to all federal-owned lands and waters administered by [the Park Service] nationwide, as well as all navigable waters lying within national parks\\", and thus the NPS could regulate activities along the whole of the navigable portion of the Nation River even if it fell outside the CSU.Sturgeon, slip op. at 11‚Äì12. Sturgeon v. Frost I =Opinion of Court= In a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's ruling.Sturgeon, slip op. at 12‚Äì16. Chief Justice Roberts characterized the Ninth Circuit's ruling as \\"a topsy- turvy approach\\" because the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act was \\"ultimately inconsistent with both the text and context of the statute as a whole.\\"Sturgeon, slip op. at 12‚Äì14. Rejecting the Ninth Circuit's conclusions, Chief Justice Roberts held that the Act directs the Park Service to regulate \\"non-public\\" lands in Alaska according to \\"Alaska-specific provisions\\".Sturgeon, slip op. at 14. Additionally, the Chief Justice wrote that \\"Section 103(c) draws a distinction between 'public' and 'non-public' lands within the boundaries of conservation system units in Alaska.\\"Sturgeon, slip op. at 14‚Äì15. However, the Supreme Court did not rule on whether the Nation River constituted a \\"public land\\" for the purposes of the Act or whether the authority of the Park Service's regulations extend to \\"non-public\\" lands.Sturgeon, slip op. at 15‚Äì16. To conduct further fact finding with respect to these issues, the Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit's ruling and remanded the case for further proceedings.Sturgeon, slip op. at 16. =Commentary and analysis= In his analysis of the case for SCOTUSblog, Todd Henderson suggested that the Court avoided several key questions because \\"the stakes in this case are potentially huge\\" and the Court wanted to \\"leave for another day the tough questions about federal power over lands in Alaska and perhaps elsewhere throughout the West.\\"Todd Henderson, Opinion analysis: A rebuke of the Ninth Circuit, and nothing more, (Mar. 23, 2016). Sturgeon v. Frost II The Supreme Court remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit for further review. In the second hearing, the Circuit Court determined that with the Nation River running through a federal reservation, the federal government had inherent water rights on the river, thus allowing the National Park Circuit's hovercraft ban to apply. A second petition for writ was filed with the Supreme Court, arguing that this interpretation would mean that the federal government would have water rights on nearly any surface water running through federally-protected lands. The case was heard on November 5, 2018, and the Court issued its unanimous decision on March 26, 2019. The Court reversed the Circuit Court's ruling, arguing that waterways were non-public lands, and that ANILCA stripped away any jurisdiction that the National Park Service had over these.

The Kenhardt Public Library The Molteno Regulations (1874) were a system of government grants to establish free, open-to-all, public libraries, in the Cape Colony, South Africa. Content Their promulgation in the nineteenth century (Government notice 442, 1874) was intended to stimulate the creation of public libraries, especially in smaller towns and villages, which would be open to all without regard to race or class. The government would provide an annual grant of up to ¬£100 (later increased), on condition that the library would make all books accessible to all members of the public, without exception, free of charge. It was in effect a \\"pound-for-pound\\" system, whereby the library's annual grant would depend on how many subscriptions, visits and donations it could show that it had received.R.J.Holloway: The History and Development of the Kimberley Africana Library and its Relationship with the Kimberley Public Library. UNISA: South Africa. Sept 2009. p.49. History (1874-1955) The regulations led to a massive expansion in the number and size of public libraries (both reading rooms and subscription libraries) across the Cape Colony, giving it one of the greatest concentration of libraries in the world by the end of the century. Due to their simplicity and success, the regulations were adopted by other parts of southern Africa, especially after union in 1910. They remained in force until they were rescinded in 1955, and were later named after the Cape Prime Minister who first issued them in 1874, John Molteno.

He is famous for defeating Hall of Fame champion Skip Away in four of their six meetings, with major stakes wins including the Woodward Stakes, Donn Handicap and Philip H. Iselin Handicap. He ran three of the eight fastest Beyer Speed Figures of the 1990s, earning him recognition as one of the best horses who never won a championship.  Background  Formal Gold is a dark bay racehorse sired by Black Tie Affair, who was the 1991 Horse of the Year and the sire of 35 stakes winners including Evening Attire. Formal Gold was the fourth foal out of the Screen King mare Ingoldsby, who ultimately produced seven winners from ten foals. Formal Gold was sold as a yearling at the 1994 Keeneland September sales for $65,000, then was resold at the Fasig-Tipton New York sales for $72,000 to John Murphy, a steelmaker from Quincy, Massachusetts. Formal Gold was conditioned by William Perry, who was a successful trainer on the mid- Atlantic circuit of racetracks including Monmouth Park and Suffolk Downs. Racing career =1996: 3-year-old season = Formal Gold was a late developing horse, not making his initial start until June 12, 1996, halfway through his three-year-old season. His talent had already been noticed though, as he went off as the odds-on favorite in a maiden special weight race at Monmouth Park, and won by lengths. The performance earned him a Beyer Speed Figure of 112, the highest ever given to a first-time starter. Moving up to allowance company, he won his next three starts as well, all as the heavy favorite by open lengths. Formal Gold then stepped up to graded stakes company in the Pennsylvania Derby run at Philadelphia Park on September 2. He was the even money favorite in a field of six but was bumped at the start and fell to last place. He gradually made up lost ground and struck the lead in mid- stretch, but the early leader Devil's Home rallied and eventually won by of a length. On October 4, Formal Gold entered the Grade I Meadowlands Cup Handicap, facing older horses for the first time. He again broke poorly and raced near the back of the back for the first half mile, then started to make up ground on the far turn while racing four wide. He closed well in the stretch but fell of a length short of the winner Dramatic Gold. Formal Gold finished his three-year-old campaign with a fifth-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Classic, behind Alphabet Soup, Louis Quatorze and favorite Cigar. Formal Gold was again hampered by a poor start and a wide trip, but made up ground late. =1997: 4-year-old season = At the age of four, Formal Gold developed into one of the fastest horses of the 1990s, repeatedly running Beyer Speed Figures in the 120s. However, he raced at the same time as several excellent older horses, especially Skip Away, who was the champion three-year- old of 1996, champion older horse of 1997 and 1998, and would later be rated #32 on the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century. Formal Gold started the year in the Grade I Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park on February 8, 1997. Perry noticed that the track was favoring early speed and instructed jockey Joe Bravo to go for the early lead. Accordingly, Formal Gold led every step of the way with Skip Away unable to close the gap, finishing lengths back in second. \\"It was like a workout\\", said Bravo. \\"We galloped right down the lane. He has speed, and he used it today.\\" Skip Away's trainer Sonny Hine pointed out that Formal Gold benefited by carrying 10 pounds less than Skip Away (nicknamed Skippy) and received a perfect trip on the rail. \\"Skippy made an effort,\\" he said. \\"We'll see that other horse next time.\\" Formal Gold shipped across country to run in the Santa Anita Handicap on March 4. He raced close to a fast early pace set by Siphon but weakened in the stretch, finishing sixth. He then shipped to Nad Al Sheba racetrack in the United Arab Emirates for the Dubai World Cup on April 3. He again raced close to the pace and was second turning into the stretch but weakened and eventually finished fifth behind Singspiel and Siphon. After a brief layoff, Formal Gold next raced on May 31 in the $500,000 Massachusetts Handicap at his trainer's home racetrack, Suffolk Downs, where he once again faced Skip Away. Topsy Robsy set the early pace followed by Skip Away with Formal Gold a few lengths back in fourth. Skip Away moved to the lead around the far turn, where Formal Gold also started his drive, racing four wide. Formal Gold and Skip Away battled down the stretch, with Skip Away prevailing by a head. The time was just of a second off the track record and both horses earned a Beyer Speed Figure of 122. On June 14, Formal Gold won the Brooklyn Handicap at Belmont Park by lengths in an excellent time of 1:46.21, despite a track that had been downgraded from fast to good by rain. Just three weeks later in the Suburban Handicap, Formal Gold and Skip Away hooked up for the third time, with Travers Stakes winner Wills Way also considered a major contender. \\"If there had been another race in two weeks, I wouldn't be running here,\\" said Perry. \\"But there's nothing else to run in until the (Aug. 23) Iselin. I know we may be squeezing him a little bit, but he's doing good, so it's worth taking a shot.\\" Ormsby and Formal Gold challenged each other for the early lead, while Skip Away and Wills Way tracked close behind. Turning into the stretch, Ormsby dropped back while Skip Away surged forward, eventually winning by lengths. Wills Way and Formal Gold battled for second, with Wills Way prevailing by of a length. The three horses next faced off in the Whitney Handicap on August 2. Formal Gold went to the early lead with Wills Way just one length behind. Around the far turn, Wills Way closed to within a head and the two then battled down the stretch, with Wills Way finally winning by a nose. Both horses earned a Beyer Speed Figure of 126. Skip Away was well back in third. On August 23, only two other horses were entered against Formal Gold and Skip Away in the Philip H. Iselin Handicap at Monmouth Park. Formal Gold was much the best, recovering from an awkward start to win by lengths. His time for miles was 1:40, breaking the old track record by seconds and earning a Beyer Speed Figure of 124. \\"I rode him aggressively ‚Äì much more aggressively than in the Whitney\\", said jockey Kent Desormeaux. \\"I made a couple of mistakes in the Whitney, and I wasn't going to make them again. They just couldn't keep up.\\" On September 20, Formal Gold was the slight favorite in the Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park, where he once again faced Skip Away and Wills Way. The three battled for the lead over the first half mile, and then Formal Gold pulled away, eventually winning by lengths. Skip Away finished a neck in front of Wills Way for second, with the rest of the field 40 lengths behind. \\"I have never ridden a horse in my life who gives so much,\\" said Desormeaux of Formal Gold. \\"He will sleep well tonight. He is a very aggressive horse all around.\\" The win earned Formal Gold a Beyer of 125. Formal Gold's next race was scheduled to be the Breeders' Cup Classic, held that year at Hollywood Park. But shortly after a routine gallop, Formal Gold went lame and was found to have a condylar fracture of the right hind leg. He underwent successful surgery on the leg, but was never able to race again. \\"I feel bad about this because Formal Gold has shown his talent all year long, and this was his chance to show it to the world\\", said Perry. \\"I really feel he was going to run a big race in the Breeders' Cup and, by winning it, would be the Horse of the Year.\\" Eclipse Award voting for Champion Older Male Horse was complicated by the fact that the main candidates had all beaten each other at various times. Formal Gold beat Skip Away four of the six times they faced each other, with dominant wins in both the Iselin and Woodward. The honors ultimately went to Skip Away though, who won his last two races of the year including a commanding win in the Breeders' Cup Classic. In a column discussing top Beyer Speed Figures, the Daily Racing Form says \\"the best horse (in terms of speed figures) was one who never won a championship and never got the acclaim he deserved: Formal Gold.\\" Retirement Formal Gold was initially retired to stud at Gainesway Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. He was relocated in 2004 to Rancho San Miguel in California and then to Esquirol Farms in Canada. Formal Gold has had limited success at stud, with his best offspring being Grade II winner Adore the Gold plus Grade III winners Trickle, Semaphore Man, Miss Matche and Transduction Gold. Pedigree Formal Gold is inbred 5s √ó 4d to Nashua, meaning Nashua appears once in the fifth generation of the sire's side of the pedigree (as the sire of Gold Digger) and once in the fourth generation of the dam's side. He is also inbred 5s √ó 4d to Bold Ruler.

During the 1925-1927 Syrian Revolt against the French Mandate, Syrian nationalists such Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar, took refuge with Sheikh HadithaThe Making of Jordan: Tribes, Colonialism and the Modern State, Yoav Alon, I.B. Taurus, 2007., p.223. in Al-Muwaqqar where the Sheikh had settled his tribe. Sultan Al-Atrash, Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar, and Nasib Bakri, three of the main leaders of the Syrian Revolt, were close friends of Sheikh Haditha and stayed with him in his camp near Azraq and in Al-Muwaqqar on several occasions.The History of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Vol. I: The Creation & Development of Transjordan, 1920-29, Ma'an Abu Nowar; (Oxford: Ithaca Press, 1989); p. 160. Indeed, they came to Amman through Azraq protected by Sheikh Haditha and secretly called on Emir Abdullah I in 1926. When Frederick Gerard Peake, Alec Kirkbride, and E.R. Stafford arrived in Al-Muwaqqar, and demanded that Sheikh Haditha hand over Syrian nationals and refugees under his care, he \\"told them that his camp was open to visitors to stay for three days before they were asked to be identified; if however, they claimed to be dakhil (someone who asks for the protection of a tribe against a threat), he could not be expected to hand them over,\\"The History of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Vol. I: The Creation & Development of Transjordan, 1920-29, Ma'an Abu Nowar; (Oxford: Ithaca Press, 1989); p. 196 as that would have violated Bedouin codes of honour and hospitality. Sheikh Haditha was also Emir Abdullah's link to Shukri Al-Quwatli, post-independence Syria's first president. In November 1936, Sheikh Haditha, along with Mithqal Al-Fayez, accompanied Fawzi Al-Qawuqji, Supreme Commander of the Arab Revolution in South-Syrian Palestine, through the desert to ensure his safe journey. Following the 1941 coup in Iraq that ousted Abdul Illah, Regent of Iraq, Emir Abdullah I dispatched the Mechanised Brigade of the Arab Legion to guide British troops across the desert to Iraq. Haditha instructed his men from Bani Sakhr serving in the Arab Legion to abstain from suppressing the Rashid Ali Gaylani revolt in Baghdad and resign from the Arab Legion rather than to fight other Arabs.Kirkbride to HC, 9 September 1941, CO 831/58.King Abdullah, Britain and the Making of Jordan, Mary C. Wilson, Cambridge University Press, 1987, p. 134. Haditha's defiance of Emir Abdullah I and the British forced him to go into self-imposed exile in Saudi Arabia. The Khraisha family had enjoyed strong relations with the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula for centuries, particularly the Shammar Tribe of Ibn Rashid, traditional rivals of the House of Saud. The Al-Khraisha family's ties with the House of Rashid went back to the time of Sheikh Haditha's father, Ali. The origin of Ali Al-Khraisha's relationship with Abdullah ibn Rashid, the founder of the Emirate of Jabal Shammar, is related in John Bagot Glubb 1978 book Arabian Adventures. Early in the nineteenth century, the formidable Shammar Tribe of Nejd underwent an internal struggle for dominance. The two rival sheikhs were Ibn Ali and Ibn Rashid and at the end of the affair Ibn Ali won the struggle for precedence and Ibn Rashid and his brother, Obeid, were driven out of the tribe they had hoped to lead. Eventually the brothers reached Jordan with only one camel between them and landed at the tent of Sheikh Ali Al-Khraisha, the Sheikh of Bani Sakhr. The Sheikh was away but the family and servants took care of the guests. During the night their camel died and so they were forced to continue their journey on foot. A short distance from the camp, they met a Bedouin on camelback. The man stopped them and asked them their news and what camp they had just come from. After hearing their story, the man asked them if their host had supplied them with a fresh mount. The brothers replied that their host was away. The rider then dismounted, obliged them to mount and his camel, revealed that he was Sheikh Ali Al-Khraisha and swore that no guest of his would reach his tent riding and leave on foot. Years later, Abdullah Ibn Rashid returned to Shammar, drove out his rival, and became Emir of Northern Nejd. Abdullah and his descendants ruled for fifty years until they were driven out by Ibn Saud in 1920. For as long as they ruled, the House of Rashid treated the Khraisha family as friends and allies in memory of the camel given by Ali Al-Khraisha to Abdullah ibn Rashid in his destitution generations before.Arabian Adventures: Ten Years of Joyful Service, John Glubb, Cassell, London; 1978, p.157-158. In addition to supporting the Syrian nationalists in the mid-1920s, Sheikh Haditha also contributed to the Palestinian struggle.The Making of Jordan: Tribes, Colonialism and the Modern State, Yoav Alon, I.B. Taurus, 2007, p.121 He also had firm bonds with the Circassians and Chechens of Transjordan who fled persecution in their original lands for being Muslim and whose rights in Jordan Sheikh Haditha fought for and defended. Sheikh Haditha was also a much sought-after and highly respected tribal arbiter and mediator;Al-Jazira, 29 May 1940 in affairs ranging from blood feuds to land disputes. For example, in 1943, Sheikh Haditha spent twenty days in Sama with officers from the Arab Legion to determine the boundaries of disputed land in the area Muqadimah li-Dirasat al-Asha'ir al-Urduniyyah, 2nd Edition, Ahmad Al- Abbadi; Al-Dar aL-Arabiyah lil-Nashr, Amman; 1985, p.198.

Legacy  alt= Sheikh Haditha was respected both by his fellow Arabs, the orientalists who met him on their travels, and by the British Mandate officers with whom he came into contact, several of whom expressed their grudging admiration for the sheikh as in this report by Captain Dunbar Brunton in 1920: \\"Haditha, in particular, deserves the greatest credit for the way in which he acted as intermediary...sensible and reliable...is not wealthy but never begs like others and is generous...His manners are quiet and he has a great personal charm. One might term him the only real gentleman among the sheikhs of this region.\\"Brunton, Political Report, 9 October 1920, Brunton Papers; Middle East Centre, St Antony's College, Oxford.The Making of Jordan: Tribes, Colonialism and the Modern State, Yoav Alon, I.B. Taurus, 2007, p.32. Glubb described Sheikh Haditha as \\"a man of sincere religion and a high standard of honour.\\"UKNA, Glubb's report, June 1936, CO831/37/3. As Alon writes in The Making of Jordan: Tribes, Colonialism and the Modern State, \\"Haditha clearly embodied the stereotypical Bedouin gentleman so admired by the British. It is worth noting that Britons serving in Transjordan in later years often remarked on his virtues.\\" he Making of Jordan: Tribes, Colonialism and the Modern State, Yoav Alon, I.B. Taurus, 2007, p.32. In Adventures in Arabia, Seabrook describes Haditha as a man who possessed a \\"courtly dignity ... a tall, elderly man, of grave and noble countenance, seldom smiling, with whitening beard, and the far-away look of a dreamer in his eyesAdventures in Arabia, W.B. Seabrook, 1927; Harcourt, Brace and Company, New York; p.106.... [The Bedouin's] code of honor, in some respects, is as quixotic and fantastic as that of King Arthur's knights. Haditha embodied it, perhaps more than any other Bedouin I met. My friend Mithkal [Al-Fayez] was rich, prosperous, and worldly-wise, cynical, too, in an amiable way; yet he revered Haditha as a sort of saint.Adventures in Arabia, W.B.

Description The compact dense shrub typically grows to a height of . It has branchlets that are covered in golden or white coloured hairs on young growth. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The grey-green coloured phyllodes are crowded at the ends of the branchlets and have a linear to linear-oblanceolate shape. The phyllodes have a length of and a width of with one to three indistinct main longitudinal nerves. It blooms in July and produces yellow flowers. The simple inflorescences occur singly or in pairs in the axils and have spherical flower-heads with a diameter of containing 30 to 45 light golden coloured flowers. Following flowering thin leathery seed pods form that have a linear to narrowly oblong shape but are curved and undulate with a length of and a width of . Taxonomy The species was first formally described in 1928 by the botanists Joseph Maiden and William Blakely as part of the work Descriptions of fifty new species and six varieties of western and northern Australian Acacias, and notes on four other species as published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. It was reclassified as Racosperma chrysopodum by Leslie Pedley in 2003 then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006. Distribution It is native to an area in the Wheatbelt and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia growing in sandy, clay or loamy granitic soils. The shrub has a limited distribution extending from around Karlgarin in the west to around Lake Cronin in the east and to around Newdegate and Lake King where it is usually a part of Eucalyptus woodland communities.

It is native to an area along the coast from the Goldfields-Esperance to the Mid West regions of Western Australia. Description The bushy erect pungent shrub typically grows to a height of with branchlets that are ribbed, glabrous or sparsely appressed-puberulous with straight hairs. Stipules are present only on young fresh shoots. The trunk and branches have smooth green or brown bark. The leathery leaves have phyllodes or are sessile, patent to ascending, inequilateral basally, subulate-linear, elliptic in shape and straight to recurved. They are mostly in length and wide. It blooms from July to October and produces yellow flowers. The inflorescences are simple with 1‚Äì3 per axil and peduncles which are long, Heads are globular with a diameter, containing 30-50-flowers that have a deep golden color. The flowers are pollinated by many different species of insects. A moderate number of seeds will be produced during favourable seasons. The green-brown pod which forms later is a linear shape and is slightly raised over the seeds. The pod is approximately long and contains between 10 and 15 of mostly viable black seeds. The valves of the pod will recurve once the seed is shed, usually in December. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Jacques Labillardi√®re in 1807 as Mimosa cochlearis as part of the work Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. It was then reclassifed as Acacia cochlearis by Heinrich Wendland in 1820 as part of the work Commentatio de Acaciis aphyllis. It was reclassified in 2003 by Leslie Pedley as Racosperma cochleare then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006. The species can be confused with Acacia melanoxylon. Distribution and habitat A. cochlearis grows in sandy soils and is found in coastal areas on sandplains and sand dunes. It grows in coastal areas from Lancelin to Israelite Bay, where it is found growing as solitary plants or in dense thickets. Uses The shrub is sold as a suitable medium size shrub for gardens in coastal regions or areas with sandy soils. It is also used to stabilise dune or coastal areas. A. cochlearis establishes quickly and reliably in stabilised soils. Although it is must be protected from high winds it is utilised in mixed plantings with other species such as Acacia rostellifera and Scaevola crassifolia. It is an indicator of good quality dunes as the species is vulnerable to disturbance once established. Cultivation A. cochlearis can be grown from seed. The seeds should be soaked in hot water or lightly abraded with fine sandpaper prior to planting. They should be sown in free draining soil and can benefit from the addition of disease-free soil from existing plants to transfer the Rhizobium bacteria that are important in nitrogen fixation. Plants require a position in full sun.

Biography  Eren Erdem was born in Fatih, ƒ∞stanbul on 14 August 1986 to Hasan Erdem and his wife H√ºsniye. He completed his primary and secondary education in ƒ∞stanbul. During his youth, he worked as an auxiliary staff to make extra money. He wrote eight books: * Gayya Karanlƒ±ƒüƒ±ndan Kur‚Äôan Aydƒ±nlƒ±ƒüƒ±na, Abdestli Kapitalizm * Nurjuvazi * ≈ûeytan Evliyalarƒ± * Selman-ƒ± Pak * ƒ∞slam ve Kapitalizm * Riya Tabirleri, Devrim Ayetleri Erdem was elected as a Republican People's Party (CHP) Member of Parliament for Istanbul in the June 2015 general election. He was re-elected in November 2015. He is married with one child and can speak English at a fluent level. Erdem leaked a number of documents from Turkish government surveillance of ISIL-members. The documents are said to show detailed information about activities and locations of ISIL-members, but also a lack of action on part of the Turkish government. Erdem has alleged a cover-up by the Turkish government, which is implicated in having poor control of the Turkish- Syrian border. Erdem also claims that sarin-gas was transported through Turkey to Syria, later used in the Ghouta chemical attack in 2013, as well as later ISIL-attacks against civilians. Erdem showed before the parliament a case where investigations leading to the arrest of 13 potential Turkish ISIL- members were made, but later inexplicably dropped. The leaks are also said to implicate that Erdogan's immediate family in his son-in-law made financial gain through oil-deals with ISIL-members.

The buildings were constructed in 1912, and once comprised a group of shops and a cinema. The buildings have elements of Federation Free Style architectural design such as asymmetry and use of two contrasting building materials of brick and cement render. Replacing a single storied bungalow structure that faced York Street, the Empire theatre was designed by architect Tom Anthoness and was built by J. Ashman and Warner. Initially the building held a theatre and shops. The theatre was able to hold 1,000 people. The theatre cost ¬£5,000 and was owned and operated by West's Picture Company. It boasted refreshment stalls, a winter garden for ladies and a spacious dress circle. Features of the two storey building include a corner entrance, asymmetrical facade, parapet wall concealing roof, informal groupings of windows, gabled pediment and decorative skyline features. In 2000 a portion of the building was converted to a nightclub. It was closed for some time and reopened to include a bar on the ground floor in 2006.

Picciano is an American scholar, author, and academic who has made significant contributions to the study of digital technology in education leadership, planning, and instruction. He has conducted major national studies with Jeff Seaman on instructional technology use in American K-12 education. He holds faculty positions at Hunter College, the Graduate Center, and the School of Professional Studies, all at the City University of New York.  Early life and career  Picciano was born on August 19, 1947, in New York City. He attended Catholic schools and upon graduation from high school enrolled at Hunter College on a part-time basis and worked full-time and was introduced to the then-new field of computer programming. In 1967, he decided to attend college full-time and worked part-time at the Hunter College Computer Center. Upon graduation in 1970, he began his professional work as a computer specialist. He taught his first college-level course in computer programming and systems analysis in 1971. In the 1970s and 1980s, Picciano was involved with developing computer facilities, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) laboratories, data-management systems, and communication networks at the City University of New York and the State University of New York. In the late 1970s and 1980s, he held administrative positions and was appointed in 1985 as vice president and deputy to President Donna Shalala at Hunter College. In 1986, he completed a Ph.D. in education leadership from Fordham University. His dissertation examined computer-support systems for decision making and was based on the work of Herbert Simon. In 1989, he decided to leave administration and focus his career on teaching and scholarship and was appointed to the faculty in the Hunter College School of Education. In the 1990s, Picciano was a fellow at the City University of New York Open Systems Laboratory where he worked on designing multimedia and distance learning teaching models. To support his work, he received funding from IBM, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the National Science Foundation, and U.S. Department of Education. In 1991, Picciano along with colleagues Steve Brier, Josh Brown, and Bret Eynon developed The Five Points, a multimedia program incorporating video from the American Social History Project, depicting Irish immigrant life in New York City in the 1850s. This program was selected to be part of several exhibits including a national exhibit entitled \\"New Learning Technologies\\" held in San Diego, California, and sponsored by IBM in June, 1992. In 2000, Picciano became one of the founding members of the Sloan Consortium (Sloan-C) of Colleges and Universities which today is known as the Online Learning Consortium. He continues to serve on the Board of Directors of the Online Learning Consortium. He was elected to the Inaugural Class of the Sloan Consortium‚Äôs Fellows in 2010 and was also awarded the 2010 Sloan Consortium‚Äôs National Award for Outstanding Achievement in Online Education by an Individual. = Publications = Picciano has written sixteen books and over sixty articles, book chapters, and monographs. He has edited ten special editions of the Online Learning Journal (formerly the Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks). His articles have been published in the Online Learning Journal, Teachers College Record, Education Sciences, The Internet and Higher Education, and The Journal of Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia. His first book, entitled Computers in the Schools: A Guide to Planning and Administration was published in 1994 followed by Educational Leadership and Planning for Technology in 1998, which became one of the most widely used textbooks in this field. As of 2016, five editions of Educational Leadership and Planning for Technology have been published. In 1994, Picciano published an article, Technology and the Evolving Educational-Industrial Complex, which accurately predicted the role that technology companies and private enterprise would have in American education in the first part of the 21st century. Picciano wrote Distance Learning: Making Connections across Virtual Space and Time in 2001, which was one of the early books to explore the potential of online education. He published Education Research Primer in 2004 as an introduction to educational research and statistics. Keith Jones of University of Southampton reviewed the book and wrote \\"this book is eminently approachable and readable, practical and helpful.\\" In 2010, he co-authored with Joel Spring, The Great American-Education Industrial Complex, an in-depth examination of the nexus of education policymaking and for-profit corporate entities. In 2017, he published Online Education Policy and Practice: The Past, Present, and Future of the Digital University. In this book, Picciano predicts that augmented technology such as neural implants, intelligent self- generating nanobots, and brainnets will evolve that will redefine many human endeavors including education. In 2018, Picciano published with Chet Jordan CUNY‚Äôs First Fifty years: Triumphs and Ordeals of a People‚Äôs University, which is a critical history of the City University of New York.

She was married to conductor Alexander Kitschin. Once the doyenne of the Paris Opera Company, she was also a recording star with more than 80 records to her credit. Early life Born of Ukrainian mother and French- descent father, Belmas received her first lessons in singing from her mother and older sister. At the age of 16 she was auditioned by the composer, Alexander Glazunov. She then started her training at the Kiev Conservatory, after which she made her debut at the Odessa Opera Theater, where she had her first success in the role of Tatyana in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. By 1921 she was the leading singer at the Odessa Opera Theater. In this time she married a wealthy landowner which enabled her to continue her training at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow under the direction of maestro Emil Kuper. Fleeing from Russia (1921) During World War I her husband was seriously wounded and Belmas moved to St. Petersburg to nurse him. After losing her home as well as both her parents during the Russian Revolution and then also her husband during the Russian Civil War, she fled Ukraine in late 1921 and crossed the Polish border. In Poland she married the pianist and conductor, Alexander Kitschin. They soon moved to Wiesbaden in Germany. Operatic career in France Belmas then decided to go to Milan in Italy to further her studies in the Italian repertoire. Upon arrival in Italy she said: \\"I had only two dresses and one pair of shoes with holes in them. But I was happy and had the opportunity to meet some very great people.\\" After completing her studies in Italy, she went to Paris - \\"young, enthusiastic, but terribly shy\\". All she had with her was a suitcase with a change of clothes, and a letter from Alexander Glazunov directed to the influential owner of a chain of French newspapers (whose name is not recorded in any of the sources) and which would provide her with an entr√©e to Paris opera circles. After reading the letter of introduction, the newspaper magnate asked Belmas to sing for him and then later invited her to sing before an audience at his home. Among those present in the audience were Marshal Philippe P√©tain as well as many of Paris's chief critics. The following day the critics praised her voice in their newspapers. Agents and impresarios besieged her with offers of parts. In the course of three months she performed 16 concerts, singing with the eight leading orchestras of France. One of those whose attention was attracted by her voice, was Jacques Rouch√©, the director of the Grand Opera House of Paris. Although Rouch√© complimented her on her voice, he offered her no engagements. At the Paris Exhibition of 1926, Belmas performed 17 concerts at the Grand Palais, one of them before President Gaston Doumergue to whom she was introduced. Jacques Rouch√© was also present at one of the concerts, after which he invited her to sing at the Grand Opera House. \\"He told me he had waited until he could invite me to sing as a guest artist. That is why those earlier engagements did not come from him.\\" He asked her to sing in Faust, but she insisted on singing Aida, to which Rouch√© agreed. She subsequently made her debut in Aida on 18 January 1926 without any rehearsals: \\"Guest artists were expected to be able to know their parts well enough to play them without rehearsal.\\" In October 1926 Belmas and her husband returned to Milan where they were invited to perform before Arturo Toscanini at La Scala. In 1928 they moved from France to Berlin where she expanded her repertoire and was also invited to make 80 records consisting of opera arias and Russian songs. Operatic tour in Australia (1928) In November 1927 it was announced in newspapers, magazines and many opera programs that Irene Minghini Cattaneo was planning to travel to Australia with a particularly stellar group of Italian and other artists including Belmas, for a six-month season of opera \\"the likes of which Australia had never seen\\". The company was to appear at Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth. This tour, in collaboration with the La Scala Opera Company, Milan, took place in 1928, with Belmas performing as one of the principal singers of the Melba-Williamson Opera Company. By the time the company reached Sydney, many cast changes had been announced. Australians who had been promised leading roles, were not used, which led to some critics labeling it as an Italian conspiracy. Among others, Giannina Arangi-Lombardi replaced Belmas as Santuzza in Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, which had been the Russian soprano's only role up to that time on the tour. Although Lombardi sang well, critics still maintained that there was no reason to have \\"engineered\\" the replacements. Belmas ended up giving recitals during the rest of the season before returning to Europe disappointed, despite the positive reports written about her in the newspapers. This tour was described by Bob Rideout as one of the most famous events in the history of opera in Australia. Move to South Africa (1934) Photo taken during the production of The Tales of Hoffman in Durban in 1964, consisting of many students of Xenia BelmasUpon returning from Australia, Belmas continued her career which took her on tours of France, Germany, Poland, Monte Carlo (1931), the Baltic States (1932) and Scandinavia. In 1934 she came to South Africa on a tour of twenty concerts in South African cities. The couple arrived in Cape Town on 25 July 1934. While in South Africa, her second husband deserted her for another woman, after he had gambled away all of Belmas's savings. Belmas decided to remain in South Africa living in relative obscurity in a house at 474 Bartle Road in Umbilo, Durban where she taught singing. Students included Perla Siedle (\\"The Lady in White\\"), Clare Ellis Brown, Harold Lake, Denise McWilliam, Josslyn Kahn, Dorothy Avrich, Rose Barnett, Venetia Dawber, Magrit Habermann, and George van Wyngaard. Belmas wanted to see grand opera performed in South Africa, and in 1964 Dr Heinrich Haape produced both Madam Butterfly and The Tales of Hoffman in Durban with many of her students singing in these operas. The house at 474 Bartle Road in Umbilo, Durban, where Xenia Belmas lived and taught her students. Her disappearance at the peak of her career in Europe, led to much speculation among biographers, many of whom ended their notes on her life and career with \\"believed dead, nothing more is known of this singer\\". In December 1964 Harry Farber, secretary of the Johannesburg Historical Record Society, revealed to Belmas's biographer, Leo Riemens, that she was in fact alive and living in Durban. This helped Riemens to conclude his biography on her life. Belmas celebrated her 80th birthday on 6 February 1971. She died in Durban, South Africa, on 2 February 1981 of cancer. Her remains were transferred to Kiev in 2000 where she was reburied in the cemetery of Bajkovo. Notable recordings As a tribute to her, two long-playing albums of her best recordings were issued under the name: Lebendige Vergangenheit: Xenia Belmas and Lebendige Vergangenheit: Xenia Belmas II.

It publishes research, organises rallies and petitions and conducts ligitation.  History  The CAA was set up in early August 2014, after an increase in antisemitic incidents that accompanied the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. A grassroots campaign, it grew largely out of social media activity among those who felt more should be done to promote the Jewish community's concerns after a meeting to discuss responses where a campaigner had her concerns dismissed by Board of Deputies president Vivian Wineman. In January 2015, the then UK Home Secretary, Theresa May, praised CAA for its work and undertook to ensure that the law against antisemitism is \\"robustly enforced\\". It was registered as a charitable incorporated organisation (CIO) on 1 October 2015. Its chair is Gideon Falter and its first director of communications was Jonathan Sacerdoti. Publications CAA publishes primary and secondary research based on polling and freedom of information requests. CAA's National Antisemitic Crime Audit collects and analyses antisemitic crime data from all police forces in the UK. CAA uses the report to assess trends in antisemitic crime and to make recommendations to the British government. =Criticism= The All-Party Parliamentary Group against Antisemitism wrote in 2015 that > We were somewhat disappointed to note that not all of the messages from that > group (the CAA) have been in line with CST‚Äôs stated approach of seeking to > avoid undue panic and alarm. We encourage Jewish communal leaders and others > when speaking on antisemitism to follow CST‚Äôs example and to be reassuring > and responsible in their language, taking into account the activity which as > we have outlined had been undertaken before the summer and during it. So > too, it is important that the leadership do not conflate concerns about > activity legitimately protesting Israel‚Äôs actions with antisemitism, as we > have seen has been the case on some occasions.Report of the All-Party > Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism, February 2015. In January 2015, the Institute for Jewish Policy Research said that a CAA survey about antisemitism was \\"littered with flaws\\", and \\"may even be rather irresponsible\\". After criticism by the CAA of Shami Chakrabarti over her 2016 report into antisemitism within the Labour Party, a number of British Jews wrote to The Guardian newspaper dissociating themselves from \\"the pro-Israel lobbyists of the Campaign Against Antisemitism\\". In July 2018, the Labour MP Margaret Hodge became one of a number of honorary patrons of CAA. In the run up to the 2019 United Kingdom general election, CAA asked her to resign as a patron because she was standing as a Labour Party candidate; she did so but described their request as \\"both astonishing and wounding\\", showing a lack of respect and impugning her integrity.Margaret Hodge‚Äôs Diary: Reselection triumphs, a shocking letter, and why women get more anti-Semitic abuse, New Statesman, 6 November 2019 In February 2020, the Morning Star reported that Shahrar Ali, the Home Affairs spokesman of the Green Party of England and Wales, had made a formal complaint to the Charity Commission for England and Wales that the CAA had failed to be independent of party politics - a legal requirement for charities - which the commission was assessing. The CAA had previously described a 2009 speech by Ali as anti-semitic and an \\"offensive rant\\".  Rallies and petitions  Their first demonstration was against the Tricycle Theatre in London which, in August 2014, had refused to participate in that November's UK Jewish Film Festival due to the contemporaneous conflict in Gaza, unless the festival rejected funding from parties involved, notably a ¬£1400 sponsorship from the Israeli embassy, which the Tricycle Theatre offered to replace. Later in August, following discussions with the festival organizers, the Tricycle withdrew its condition. In August 2018, CAA organised a demonstration outside Labour's headquarters to protest against the handling of antisemitism in the UK Labour Party, and to condemn Jeremy Corbyn.Hundreds protest anti-Semitism outside Labour HQ, Jewish News, 8 August 2018 Also in August 2018 the organisation launched a change.org petition titled \\"Jeremy Corbyn is an antisemite and must go\\", the petition featuring a Labour slogan modified to read \\"For the many not the Jew\\", was signed by over 30,000 by 30 August 2018.30,000 sign petition calling for Jeremy Corbyn to quit over antisemitism, The Times, Dulcie Lee, 30 August 2018 A counter petition against the CAA with the title \\"To Get the Charity Commission to Deregister the Zionist Campaign Against Anti-Semitism\\" was signed by almost 7,500 and sent to the Charity Commission, which said in response that it was \\"assessing concerns raised about the Campaign Against Antisemitism‚Äôs campaigning activities\\". In October 2018, the Charity Commission noted that charities must be independent of party politics and insisted that the CAA reword its petition. In November 2018, the CAA asked the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to investigate the Labour Party. In May 2019, following complaints submitted by the Jewish Labour Movement and the CAA, the EHRC launched a formal investigation into whether Labour had \\"unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish\\".  Litigation  CAA has used the process of judicial review to scrutinise and reverse decisions made by the British government and authorities. In March 2017, CAA forced the CPS to quash a decision not to prosecute an alleged far-right leader over a speech in which he issued a call to \\"free England from Jewish control\\". In December 2017 the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute an Islamic Human Rights Commission director who was one of the organisers of a Quds Day rally, who, during the rally, allegedly stated that Zionists were responsible for the Grenfell Tower fire, called for Israel's destruction, and that he was fed up with Zionists, their rabbis, synagogues, and supporters. The CAA attempted to begin a private prosecution for inciting racial or religious hatred, however this was blocked by the CPS, as they had determined there was no \\"realistic prospect of conviction\\".CAA takes legal action against the CPS for blocking Al Quds Day march leader prosecution, Jewish Chronicle, 3 September 2018No criminal charge for Al Quds rally speaker who blamed ‚ÄòZionists‚Äô for Grenfell disaster, Jewish Chronicle, 13 December 2017Prosecution of Al-Quds Day march leader blocked by Crown Prosecution Service, Jewish Chronicle, 5 July 2018 In early 2018, CAA brought a successful private prosecution against Alison Chabloz, a holocaust denier who released three YouTube videos of self-written antisemitic songs characterising Auschwitz as a \\"theme park\\" and the Holocaust as the \\"Holohoax\\".Blogger claims \\"no proof\\" gas chambers killed Jewish people, BBC News, 7 March 2018'Holocaust revisionist' on trial for anti-Semitic songs, BBC News, 10 January 2018Blogger Alison Chabloz sings along to antisemitic song (((Survivors))) in court, The Times, January 10, 2018Blogger 'mocked Anne Frank and Holocaust survivors', court told, ITV News, January 11, 2018 Chabloz was subsequently imprisoned for breaking the conditions of her suspended sentence. In July 2018, Gilad Atzmon was forced to apologise to CAA chairman Gideon Falter, and pay costs and damages, after being sued for libel. Atzmon acknowledged that he had falsely stated that Falter had personally profited from fabricating antisemitic incidents. In 2019, the CAA was sued by Tony Greenstein for libel in relation to what is or is not antisemitism following five articles it had published about him. In 2017, Greenstein had launched a petition asking the Charity Commission to deregister the organisation, claiming its purpose was to limit freedom of speech by calling opponents of Israel antisemitic. Opposition to events In August 2019, the organisation asked Goldsmiths, University of London to cancel a booking made by the Communist Party of Great Britain because they objected to some of the speakers who, they said, \\"have a history of baiting Jews or outright antisemitism\\". The university in response referenced their commitment to free speech and that hiring event space to legal organisations was a common practice amongst universities. In February 2017, a letter to The Guardian signed by 250 academics claimed that the CAA cites the Working Definition of Antisemitism in asking its supporters to \\"record, film, photograph and get witness evidence\\" about Israeli Apartheid Week events; and the CAA \\"will help you to take it up with the university, students' union or even the police.\\" The signatories believe \\"These are outrageous interferences with free expression, and are direct attacks on academic freedom....It is with disbelief that we witness explicit political interference in university affairs in the interests of Israel under the thin disguise of concern about antisemitism\\".

His workshop is located at the archeological site of the Godal Temple in Gyeonggi-do. Techniques and reception Much of Lee's work is characterized by natural materials, such as carved wood and stone. Sedimentary sections, tiles, pottery shards, and the like are often a part of his deliberately rustic works. Lee's process consists of his using natural materials to loosely sculpt a piece and then burying the piece to add natural weathering and wear. He then \\"excavates\\" the noticeably rougher finished sculpture. Critic Choi Tae-man explains the process in detail: \\"[Lee Yeoung- sup] first prepares a drawing of the object, then he etches a second drawing using while China clay into the earth of the courtyard of his studio, and fills like a mold the inside the etching with cement, sand, plaster and fragments of terra cotta. The resulting molded form, which is solid and rough, reminds us of a clay statuette or small mummy.\\" The prevalent theme of \\"time\\" present in Lee's technique and sculptures has been praised as one of the most prominent facets of his work. Professor Lee Jinkyung of the Seoul National University of Technology has praised both Lee Yeoung-sup's \\"excavation\\" technique of creating sculptures and the resulting artwork, stating that the artist \\"excavates life that is encapsulated in time.\\" Additionally, Professor Lee notes that \\"Lee Yeoung-sup who likes simple, uncomplicated figures creates an uncanny sense of time\\", and that the artist's works are almost a sort of \\"realism... not imbued with tension, but one that gives comfort and warmth with a hint of humor.\\" Art critic Choi Tae-man also praises Lee's process and resulting work: \\"Lee Yeoung-sup's creative process demonstrates that what has disappeared has not really disappeared, but just been forgotten; and that things exist underground and send signals to those who might love them while they wait to be discovered one day. His simple, unfashionable ford are in the image of archeological remains.\\" Choi notes the uniqueness of Lee's technique and artwork as a \\"difficult, original and creative style founded on his desire to pour into his work the continuity of time that he has witnessed and admired at the foot of the archeological site of the Godal Temple, in which his studio is located. He shows us that time is not lost, but rediscovered.\\" As of 2016, Lee's works are still on display worldwide in both group and private exhibitions.

The station opened in 1895 and was originally installed in the Egidio e Pio Gavazzi silk factory in Desio (Milan), where it operated until 1954. It supplied electricity for lighting and for the operation of 1,800 looms, generating alternating electric current at a voltage of 200 V.  History  Designed at the Polytechnic University of Milan, it was built by combining a steam engine from the Franco Tosi company of Legnano and a pair of alternators from the Brown Boveri company. The power station opened on November 9, 1895; the ceremony was attended by King Umberto I and Margherita of Savoy, to whom the plant was dedicated. = Museum = Detail In 1958 Egidio e Pio Gavazzi proposed to donate the power plant to the Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci. In order to exhibit the large machine, the floor was demolished, a stronger basement was built to support the item and the technical press consultation room was moved. Then the Desio plant was dismantled using maintenance cranes and it was transported with a Riva lorry to the museum, where it was reassembled by hand and connected to an electric motor, coupled with a reduction gear, and set in motion. The furnace and boiler, with their connected steam distribution pipes and pumps, were not transferred to the museum.  Description  The station contains two parts: thermal, consisting of a steam engine with two horizontal cylinders, and electric, consisting of two alternators and two exciter dynamos. There is also an electric control panel and a lighting system with 8 lamps. The machine is activated by an electric motor, connected to it by a chain which encircles a pulley, and it no longer produces current.  Technique  This machine is an example of a compound steam engine. Although it relied on the finest nineteenth-century technologies, the \\"Regina Margherita\\" was not a cutting- edge piece of machinery. Ten years before its making, the Englishman Sir Charles Algernon Parsons had already invented the steam turbine. In the latter device the force of the steam acts directly on the blades of the wheel, producing the rotation necessary to operate the alternators. The steam turbine is more efficient than a cylinder and piston system because it reduces energy waste from the transformation of alternating motion into rotary motion and from the transmission of movement through connecting rods, cranks and belts.

Due to German army advances, National Council also met in Petrograd, in secrecy from the new Bolshevik regime. Creation On October 14‚Äì17, 1917 Latvian organizations and politicians met in Petrograd and agreed to create a Council that would include 3 representatives from Vidzeme, 3 from Latgale, 3 from Kurzeme, 2 from refugee support Central committee, 1 from Baltic refugee organization, 2 from Iskolat, 2 from Soldiers Union, 1 from Latvian Farmers' Union, 1 from left wing and 1 from right wing of Social Democrats, as well as 1 from Eser, radical democrat and national democrat parties each, thus making sure that all Latvian political factions were represented. At this point no representatives from Baltic German, Jewish, Russian or Polish minorities were included. The first session The first session met between November 29 and December 2, 1917 (November 16‚Äì19 Old Style) in Valka. Bolshevik controlled parties and left- wing Social Democrats decided to abstain from participation. The First session is attended by representatives from Vidzeme, Latgale and Courland land councils, Latvian soldier national union, Latgalian soldiers, Latvian refugee support Central committee, Baltic refugee support committee, Latgalian refugee support committee, Latvian Farmers' Union, Latvian National Democratic Party, Latvian Democrat Party, Latvian Radical Party and Latvian Cooperative Congress. Left-wing Vidzeme land council representatives and Social Democratic menshevik faction participated as observers only. Some delegates wanted to proclaim independence right away, but it was opposed by Farmers' Union delegates. The compromise decision was made that the exact status of the Latvian state shall be decided by a future Constitutional Assembly. On November 19 delegates sent three congratulatory telegrams - to Ukrainian Central Rada, to Nationalities Congress in Kiev and to Parliament of Finland. More importantly, on November 19 session National Council adopted two resolutions. The first one was addressed to the \\"Russian revolutionary democracy\\" and proclaimed unification of all Latvian inhabited lands. This meant that Latgale is to be united with the Latvian inhabited lands of Governorate of Livonia and Courland Governorate. The second one was addressed to \\"foreign countries and nations\\" proclaiming Latvia's autonomy. \\"Latvia, which includes Vidzeme, Kurzeme and Latgale is an autonomous state unit, its internal and external system will be decided by its Constitutional Assembly and a popular plebiscite.\\"Latvie≈°u pagaidu NacionƒÅlƒÅ padome National Council established 7 departments 1)Foreign affairs department; 2)Defense and rebuilding department; 3)Constitutional Assembly election commission; 4)Finances department; 5)Commission for creating Constitution; 6)Agrarian department; 7)Culture and book department.Latvie≈°u Pagaidu NacionƒÅlƒÅs Padomes pirmƒÅs sesijas protokols (29.11.-02.12.(16.-19.11.)1917.) VoldemƒÅrs ZƒÅmuƒìls was elected chairman of National Council with KƒÅrlis Pauƒºuks, J. Rubulis and J. Palcmanis as co-chairs. On December 19, 1917 (Old Style), January 1, 1918 the Bolshevik dominated Iskolat, which was also located in Valka, moved to ban the National Council, and it relocated to Petrograd. The second session Between January 15‚Äì18 (Old Style), 28-31, 1918 (New Style), the National Council met in Petrograd. It was opened by the Council Chairman VoldemƒÅrs ZƒÅmuƒìls. Arveds Bergs, Zigfrƒ´ds Anna Meierovics and JƒÅzeps RancƒÅns were then elected to chair the proceedings in rotating order. Representatives of nine parties and organizations participated in the session: representatives of Vidzeme Land council, Latgale Land council, Kurzeme Land council, Refugee support Central committee, National Soldiers Union, Latvian Farmers' Union, Radical Democratic Party, National Democratic Party, Latvian Democratic Party. Representatives of five professional organizations and ethnic Latvian farming colonies from Russia participated as observers.Latvie≈°u Pagaidu NacionƒÅlƒÅs Padomes otrƒÅs sesijas protokols (28.-31.1.1918.) One of the more important reports was delivered by the Foreign Affairs committee which had established contact with foreign embassies. Sweden had expressed indifference to Latvian independence, while France had expressed support for it. The ongoing German- Bolshevik Treaty of Brest-Litovsk negotiations mean the worst-case scenario of annexation and cultural dominance. The only future lies with the Western Allies. Meierovics said: \\"We have to stand our line and demand Latvian independence. We have to review our relationship with Germans. We have to protest against division of Latvia and ignoring its interests. However, the immediate proclaiming of Latvian state is unwise. A state needs territory, people and power. But we lack the power. Bolsheviks advocate further unity of Latvia with Russia. If we were to declare independence, we would have to organize administrative organs, to create ministries, which Bolsheviks would surely arrest. We see how hard it is for Finns and Ukrainians. But we don't even have that power which they have.\\"Latvie≈°u Pagaidu NacionƒÅlƒÅs Padomes otrƒÅs sesijas protokols (28.-31.1.1918.) On January 30 (New Style), 1918 National Council with 23 votes against 1 adopted a proclamation in which it advocated creation of an independent, democratic Latvian republic, protested against any division of ethnic Latvian lands, and protested against any peace treaties that ignore rights of national self-determination. On the last day situation in Latgale and Bolshevik danger to the ethnic Latvians living in Belarus was discussed. The third session The third session met in Petrograd in smaller numbers and deep secrecy between June 26‚Äì28, 1918 after which National Council already called itself as the only legitimate representative of Latvia. It adopted resolution in which it announced that cooperation with German occupation forces should be minimal, limited to practical issues only, and that further and more active contacts with Western Allies should be pursued. Further meetings in the Bolshevik Petrograd became impossible with the start of the Red Terror. This was tragic, as many early Cheka leaders were Latvians, and Red Latvian Riflemen served as Lenin's bodyguards. One of the Latvian Riflemen leaders Frƒ´drihs Briedis was accused of anti-bolshevik conspiracy and shot in August. After this, all National Council activities continued in Latvia. On October 23, 1918 and again on November 11 United Kingdom, represented by its Foreign Minister Arthur Balfour in a meeting with Meierovics recognized de facto Latvian independence and National Council as its government. End of National Council Despite the achievement of de facto recognition from the United Kingdom, the occupying Germany refused to recognize it, and preferred to deal with the Social Democrat dominated Democratic bloc. To resolve this impasse, National Council and Democratic bloc united in new Tautas padome (Peoples council). With the proclamation of Latvian independence on November 18, 1918 by Tautas padome, the National Council relinquished its authority to Tautas padome and its representatives joined it. Latvian Independence date controversy Some politicians from the National Council and later historians have claimed that December 2, 1917 or January 30, 1918 declarations should really be considered the Latvian Independence declarations, instead of the much later November 18, 1918 declaration, which was a result of political compromise between the National Council and the Democratic bloc.

It is located at the junction of Maine State Routes 126 and 213. It was built in 1869, and served as the community's town hall until 1958. It is now maintained by the local historical society as a museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The Jefferson Town House is located on the western edge of the dispersed rural village center of Jefferson, on the north side of SR 126 (Gardiner Road) at its junction with SR 213. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a steep gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a foundation of original fieldstone and replacement concrete piers. Its front facade is symmetrical, with a pair of entrances on the ground floor, three windows in the half-story, and a fourth window near the gable peak. A wooden flagpole is mounted below the topmost window, extending upward in front of it and beyond the gable ridge. The interior of the building has a large meeting space taking up the first floor, and two rooms on the second. Next to the town house stands a small gabled building that once served as a \\"hearse house\\", for storage of the town hearse. It is believed to be older than the town house. The town house was built in 1869 at a cost of $895, replacing an 1828 town house that had been located nearby. The upper level of the building is a relative oddity in Maine's 19th- century town houses, and was apparently rented out to fraternal organizations and used for one season for high school classes. It was leased to the local historical society in 1962, which has cared for it since.

A sequel to the 2012 film Student of the Year, it stars Tiger Shroff, Tara Sutaria, and Ananya Panday, alongside and Harsh Beniwal in the supporting roles. The film follows Rohan Sachdev, a college student in a quest to become Student of the Year. Heavily panned by critics and audiences alike, it holds a rating of 7% on Rotten tomatoes. Student of the Year 2 was announced in October 2017. Initially, Malhotra and Shroff were to collaborate for a different film; when they found the final script unsatisfactory, they tweaked it and planned to make it a sequel. It marks the debuts of both Sutaria and Panday and pursues a plot that is unrelated to its predecessor. Principal photography for the film began in April 2018 at Dehradun, and ended in September 2018. The film's soundtrack was composed by Vishal-Shekhar, with lyrics written by Anvita Dutt Guptan, Kumaar and Vayu, and released under the banner Zee Music Company. Student of the Year 2 was theatrically released in India on 10 May 2019. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with the script, unreal situation, and unrealistic depiction of Indian schools thus receiving criticism; Shroff's action sequences were, however, praised. As of 7 June 2019, it has earned 981.6 million worldwide, against a budget of 700 million, including promotion and advertising costs.  Plot  Rohan Sachdev, a middle-class student at Pishorilal Chamandas College, decides to go to St. Teresa's High School, a college for the affluent and talented, after his childhood sweetheart, Mridula Chawla, transfers there. He gets a scholarship in the college. Mridula, now going by the name Mia, initially avoids Rohan in a desperate attempt to become popular, but the two begin a relationship when Rohan wins the college over by showing his sports skills. Rohan becomes friends with Manav Singh Randhawa, a popular, affluent, student and reigning Student of the Year. However, he is at odds with Manav's sister Shreya, a popular mean girl whom both detest each other and she often plays pranks on him. She tricks his Pishorilal friends into showing up at Manav's birthday party, where they are insulted, causing a rift between them and Rohan. After one of her pranks gets her in trouble with her aloof father, Sukesh, Rohan tries to make peace with Shreya, but she refuses saying she doesn‚Äôt need his sympathy. Rohan-Mia and Manav-Shreya are coupled up in an upcoming dance competition where Mia wants to win in order to gain popularity whilst Shreya wants to fulfill her dream of enrolling at a dance academy in London. Manav and Shreya win the contest after Mia falters during a step. When Rohan goes to console Mia, he instead finds her getting intimate with Manav, and realizes that Manav, knowing Mia had a crush on him, had planted her to spoil Rohan's performance since he saw him as a threat to his image. Rohan is expelled from St. Teresa's after punching Manav, and is subsequently beaten up by Manav's friends before being thrown out. Initially dejected and struggling to deal with what he sees as Mia's betrayal, Rohan eventually fights back and challenges Manav saying he, not Manav, will be winning the Student of the Year trophy. Rohan returns back to Pishorilal, where his old friends treat him with contempt. Shreya, who is impressed by Rohan's sincerity, reveals to his friends that she set them up, and also convinces Rohan to join her in a national dance competition, hoping she can study at dance school in London. The two become friends as they practice and win the dance competition. Shreya reveals her mother died upon her birth, causing her father to believe she was cursed and detested her. Mia tries to win back Rohan after leaving Manav when he cheats on her. Shreya, though, reveals that she's also in love with Rohan, which results in a heated argument between Mia and Shreya over Rohan, culminating in Shreya spilling coffee over Mia accidentally in a fit of anger and Rohan asking Shreya to leave. Though Shreya thinks Rohan will go back to Mia, he comes to her house the following day and defends Shreya to Sukesh, revealing their dance victory. During the Dignity Cup opening ceremony, a fight breaks out between Pishorilal and St. Teresa's, when Rohan's friends tease Manav and his team, ending in Rohan's teammate and rival Abhishek, being seriously injured. However, when Rohan beats up Manav to defend Abhishek, they make amends and the team decides to work together to win the Dignity Cup, training hard. When she goes to meet Abhishek in the hospital, seeing her Mia holds Rohan's hand showing Rohan patched up with her. There, Shreya apologizes to Mia. When Mia asks her about her love for Rohan, Shreya calls it a schoolgirl crush and, blessing them with happiness, leaves. Rohan leaves Mia's hand and follows Shreya asking her if she is fine. She thanks him and reveals she is leaving for London for graduating from the London School of Dance at the end of the term. At this juncture, Rohan professes his love for her, but she refuses and goes. However, Mia realizes that she has lost Rohan for good. Pishorilal, usually last, manages to climb up the ranks and gets to the final against St. Teresa's. On the night of the second-day event, Mia expresses her happiness and tries to kiss him but he turns his face and tells him he doesn't want to patch up with her, saying it's time he focused on his own dreams and not let her be his only goal. Although upset, she accepts his decision and supports Rohan in his fight. The two part as friends. The next day, before the final, Rohan confesses his love for Shreya for a second time and she accepts after he tells that Mia is just his friend and she is his present and future, and the two unite.

Shortly after the commercial success of the first film, a sequel was announced by the producers. In November 2017, a press release by Dharma Productions revealed that the sequel is slated to release in 2018; it would be directed by Punit Malhotra and star Tiger Shroff in one of the leading roles. The film was announced four years after Malhotra's previous directorial Gori Tere Pyaar Mein (2013). It was to be produced in association by Johar's Dharma Productions and Fox Star Studios. The film's announcement by the company initially conflated with that of their another production, Dhadak (2018), which roused speculation that Ishaan Khatter would star in the film. Johar denied the news and stated that the reports were \\"baseless and untrue\\". The announcement did not reveal the rest of the cast; Media reports speculated that either Disha Patani or Ananya Panday, daughter of Chunky Pandey, would play the leading lady opposite Shroff. In April 2018, Johar announced that the film's female leads would be Panday and Tara Sutaria, and it would be both their film debuts. Harsh Beniwal, a YouTuber, also makes his film debut as a Sikh student; in preparation for the role, he put on weight and grew a beard. Malhotra stated that the two films have unrelated storylines: \\"The intention of the film is not to make this a Me Too of first part, so Tiger. It‚Äôs a fresh take on the subject. It‚Äôs more about sports and action\\". Malhotra took experience from his time as a student at Mumbai's H.R. College of Commerce and Economics, but made the film version much grander. Malhotra was initially supposed to work on a different film with Shroff, but two-three months before filming, they scrapped the project and wrote a new script, a sequel to Student of the Year. In response to accusations that the film raised unhealthy expectations for college life, Shroff said, \\"What you see here is a fun school. It's a school that you want everyone to be a part of. We wanted everyone to fall in love with it\\". He plays an underdog in the film, expressing, \\"It's like Superman has been stripped of his powers\\". Samir Soni, who had previously appeared in Malhotra's I Hate Luv Storys in 2012 and since shifted to direction, returned to acting by playing a college principal, a supporting role similar to the one originally portrayed by Rishi Kapoor in Student of the Year. However, the principal in the first film identified as gay, while the one played by Soni was heterosexual and more comical. Media outlets speculated that Sidharth Malhotra, Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt, who had starring roles in the previous film, would feature in a cameo appearance for a song. In May 2019, it was revealed that Bhatt features in a special appearance for the \\"Hook-up\\" song, alongside Shroff. As a part of the Facebook original Will Smith's Bucket List, Will Smith appeared in a song in the film for satisfying his wish of appearing in a Bollywood production. = Principal photography = Principal photography for Student of the Year 2 began in 9 April 2018 in Dehradun. Shortly afterwards, parts of the film were shot at Rishikesh and Mussoorie as part of the schedule. Sets for the film were also erected in Film City, Mumbai. After the film's production was delayed, Sutaria's filming schedule began to clash with that of her other project Kabir Singh; she quit that film to ensure that shooting took place smoothly. In August 2018, a four-day sequence was filmed in Thailand. Filming ended in September 2018 with the shooting of the climax sequence. Student of the Year 2 was produced on an estimated budget of 650 million, including promotion and advertising costs.  Soundtrack  The film's soundtrack was composed by Vishal‚ÄìShekhar with lyrics written by Anvita Dutt Guptan, Kumaar and first- time collaborator Vayu, and was released under the banner Zee Music Company. Reviewing the soundtrack, Pratishruti Ganguly of Firstpost wrote, \\"Unfortunately, tracks like \\"Hook Up Song\\" and \\"Mumbai Dilli Ki Kudiyan\\" perhaps indicate that the understanding of the \\"jawaan\\" [] pulse is a tad misguided in this film\\". The song \\"Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani\\", originally sung by Kishore Kumar and composed by R. D. Burman for the soundtrack to the 1972 film Jawani Diwani, was recreated for the film, with vocals provided by Vishal Dadlani and Payal Dev, and was rebranded as \\"The Jawaani Song\\". The \\"Hook Up\\" song, picturised on Bhatt and Shroff, was sung by Neha Kakkar and Shekhar Ravjiani. Mumbai Dilli Di Kudiyaan, although released as the second song, was not used in the film, acting only as a promotional song, while Main Bhi Nahin Soya, which was released only with the full audio jukebox, was instead seen in the film, picturized on Shroff. Pakistani singer Atif Aslam recorded his version way earlier in November 2018 but in the 2019 Pulwama attack, Arijit Singh had to replace Aslam for the soundtrack version of the film. Aslam's version for the song will release in the future.  Marketing and release  The film was announced via a first look poster featuring Shroff that was released on 20 November 2017 by Johar on various social media platforms; the poster carried the release date of 23 November 2018. In April 2018, first look posters featuring Sutaria and Panday announcing the new cast members were released; this was somewhat controversial owing to most of the cast being children of other actors, and this led to accusations of Johar promoting nepotism. On 30 July 2018, a press release by Dharma Productions stated that the film's release date was postponed to 10 May 2019 due to what was speculated to be expected competition from the science fiction 2.0 (2018). Two new teaser posters were released on 10 April 2019 presenting Shroff's look as a student. Another set of posters featuring Sutaria and Panday were released on 11 April 2019. On 12 April 2019, a theatrical release poster of the film was shared by Johar on his Instagram account; Kshamaya Daniel of Rediff.com wrote of the trailer, \\"While the cast and their acting looks promising enough, the storyline ‚Äì not so much\\". Ahead of release, a special screening was conducted for close friends and other actors.  Reception  = Critical response = Student of the Year 2 was released to generally negative reviews from critics. It holds a rating of 7% on rotten tomatoes. Criticism was primarily directed to the script and unreal setting of the film. Meena Iyer of Daily News and Analysis gave it three stars out of five, writing, \\"This is the kind of film, which draws inspiration from the Archie comics with Tiger being Archie, flanked by a Veronica (Ananya) and Betty (Tara)\\". She concludes, \\"Apart from Will Smith's miss-if-you-blink appearance, watch [the film] for Tiger. Even when things around him are caving in, his ballerina grace is intact\\". Kunal Guha of Mumbai Mirror gave two and a half stars out of five and wrote it \\"excessively leans on tested formula\\", but follows, \\"There's just something winning about a man with modest means, forcing his privileged adversary to eat dust\\". Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in, who gave the film two stars out of five, wrote, \\"The sequel that nobody wanted is neither an improvement over the original nor a downgrade of it\\", referring to it as a \\"glammed-up version\\" of Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (1992). Ramnath felt that Panday showed potential in the \\"[a]ll games and no fun\\" film. In a more positive review, Ronak Kotecha of The Times of India gave the film three stars out of five, writing that it \\"doesn't have that Ishq wala love, but there is ample dosti, high school drama and cool stuff to keep you going\\". Manjusha Radhakrishnan of Gulf News stated the film was \\"[t]rite and inane, but fun to be had\\"; she felt \\"the first hour is immensely enjoyable, [but] the second half of the film feels laboured\\". Ambica Sachin of Khaleej Times wrote, \\"Call it guilty pleasure or escapism, let's get one thing out of the way, nobody goes for a Karan Johar movie expecting great cinema\\", granting it three stars out of five. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama praised the sceeenplay for being \\"praiseworthy as its peppered with some entertaining, dramatic and even moving moments\\". He wrote, \\"On the whole, Student of the Year 2 is an entertaining and an enjoyable fare which will strike a chord in the audience's hearts\\". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it one and a half stars out of five and called the film \\"an egregiously escapist campus-rumpus musical in which nattily attired, unbelievably idle boys and skimpily clad girls... play games that make as much sense as a camel race on an airport tarmac\\", adding, \\"There isn't a single moment in the film that could be described as passable\\". Similarly, Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave one and a half stars out of five and expressed, \\"This class of 2019 has predictable beats, which is to be expected in an underdog story, but that it is so stilted is disappointing: from KJo I expect much more swish and sparkle\\". She felt Shroff \\"executes his dances-and-fights efficiently, even though [he] struggles to appear student- like\\". Writing for Firstpost, Anna M. M. Vetticad gave the film one and a half stars out of five: \\"Clich√© is piled on clich√© in this unoriginal screenplay\\". Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 gave it two stars out of five and said, \\"Student of the Year 2 is both predictable, and far from original... It isn't unwatchable, it's just unnecessary.\\" = Box office = The film was a flop. In India, the film had an average opening for the first shows with an occupancy rate of 20‚Äì25%. It went on to earn 11.75‚Äì12 crore nett on its first day in India, becoming the 5th highest opener of the year. The film had fair growth on Saturday, earning 13.5‚Äì13.75 crore nett. On Sunday, collections were affected by the IPL final and polling for the 2019 Indian general election, and the film's earning came down to 12.25‚Äì12.5 crore nett. The following day, the film collected about 5 crore nett, which was considered average. On Tuesday, it earned a fair amount of 4.75‚Äì5 crore nett. The film followed with 4 crore nett on Wednesday and 3.5 crore on Thursday for a first week total of 55.25 crore nett. On its second Friday, the film had a 60 percent drop as collections reached 1.5 crore nett. The second weekend collection was 6 crore nett. On its second Monday, the film earned 1.15 crore nett. Following a drop in collections in the second week, the film stopped screening at most theatres. It has earned 98 crore worldwide, with earnings of 65 crore in India and 330 million overseas. = Home video = The film was made available as VOD on Prime Video on 1 September 2019.

The library provides services to the research staff and the students of the Faculties of medicine, pharmacy, nursing, dentistry, public health, occupational therapy, and also to the clinical-academic staff in the Hadassah Medical Center.  History  Berman Medical Library was founded in 1919 with the help of Julius Jarcho, a consulting gynecologist of Beth Israel and Sydenham Hospitals. In 1930 the library was named in his honour, The Dr. Julius Jarcho Medical Library. In the early days the library served as the central medical library in Israel, with branches across the country. In 1966 the Library merged with the Hadassah Medical Center. In 1975 the library moved to its current building, donated by Muriel and Philip Berman of Allentown, Pennsylvania. Since about 2000 the library has also included a medical history museum. Since 2003 the library has been administratively incorporated in the University Library Authority. Siegfried Plaschkes was the creator of the medical history museum. The Museum was transferred to the Berman Medical Library at the beginning of the millennium. It contains collections of Hebrew amulets, medals, ex-libris, medical stamps, and a number of ancient instruments. The collection of historical works and literature] is the most significant in the country. The collection donated by S√ºssman Muntner, dealing primarily with Maimonides. The Division of the History of Medicine is located within Berman Medical Library. Joshua O. Leibowitz (1895-1993) was the first head of the division. Leibowitz was for several years the President of the International Academy of the History of Medicine. His follower, Samuel S. Kottek (emeritus) was the second head, from 1975 till 2000. The Division is now headed by Otniel Dror. The unit provides teaching, ongoing research, and tutoring of MD and PhD theses.

History  Byzantine Bath in Thessaloniki. Christianity has always placed a strong emphasis on hygiene. Despite the denunciation of the mixed bathing style of Roman pools by early Christian clergy, as well as the pagan custom of women naked bathing in front of men, this did not stop the Church from urging its followers to go to public baths for bathing, which contributed to hygiene and good health according to the Church Father, Clement of Alexandria. The Church also built public bathing facilities that were separate for both sexes near monasteries and pilgrimage sites; also, the popes situated baths within church basilicas and monasteries since the early Middle Ages. Pope Gregory the Great urged his followers on value of bathing as a bodily need.. In circa 1454 pope Nicholas V commissioned building a bath palace in Viterbo, and the construction at the Bagno del Papa was continued on through the reigns of several popes after Nicholas V. The Vatican accounts mention of payments \\"for building done at the bath palace of Viterbo\\" during the reigns of Calixtus III, Paul II, and Sixtus IV. There also is evidence Pope Pius II was responsible for the addition of a western wing to the building.Mack, 1992,47 Contrary to popular beliefThe Bad Old Days ‚Äî Weddings & Hygiene bathing and sanitation were not lost in Europe with the collapse of the Roman Empire.The Great Famine (1315‚Äì1317) and the Black Death (1346‚Äì1351)Middle Ages Hygiene Soapmaking first became an established trade during the so-called \\"Dark Ages\\".

Hallelujah Lads and Lasses: Remaking the Salvation Army in America, 1880‚Äì1930 Christianity in Action: The History of the International Salvation Army p.16 Believing that on Epiphany day water becomes holy and is imbued with special powers, Eastern Orthodox cut holes in the ice of lakes and rivers, often in the shape of the cross, to bathe in the freezing water. The use of water in many Christian countries is due in part to the Biblical toilet etiquette which encourages washing after all instances of defecation. The bidet is common in predominantly Catholic countries where water is considered essential for anal cleansing, and in some traditionally Orthodox and Lutheran countries such as Greece and Finland respectively, where bidet showers are common.\\"Bidets in Finland\\"  Washing before Christian prayer and worship  Cantharus of Pamplona Cathedral in Spain Around the time of Tertullian, an early Church Father, it was customary for Christians to wash their hands (manulavium), face (capitilavium) and feet (pedilavium) before prayer, as well as before receiving Holy Communion. Churches from the time of Constantine the Great were thus built with an esonarthex that included a fountain known as a cantharus, where Christians would wash their hands, face and feet before entering the worship space (cf. ); they continue to be used in Orthodox Christian churches. The practice of ablutions before prayer and worship in Christianity symbolizes \\"separation form sins of the spirit and surrender to the Lord.\\" As early as the 2nd century, Christians hung a cross on the east wall of their houses, to which they prostrated in front of, as they prayed at seven fixed prayer times (cf. ). Before praying these canonical hours at seven fixed prayer times in the eastward direction of prayer, Christians belonging to the Mar Thoma Syrian Church, an Oriental Protestant denomination, as well as the Oriental Orthodox Churches such as the Coptic Orthodox Church, Indian Orthodox Church and Ethiopian Orthodox Church, wash their hands, face and feet (cf. Shehimo and Agpeya). In Oriental Orthodox Christianity, as with some Western Orthodox Christian traditions, shoes are removed in order to acknowledge that one is offering prayer before a holy God. Among Old Ritualists in the Russian Christian tradition, a prayer rug known as a Podruchnik is used to keep one's face and hands clean during prostrations, as these parts of the body are used to make the sign of the cross. Christian denominations of the Schwarzenau Brethren tradition practice footwashing in their regular celebrations of the Lovefeast, prior to receiving Holy Communion and eating.  Sex and menstruation  In Oriental Orthodox Christianity, the \\"holiness of the Church is traditionally tied scripturally with the Jerusalem Temple\\". As such, believers fast after midnight and \\"sexual intercourse is prohibited the night before communion\\" (cf. Eucharistic discipline). In the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, an Oriental Orthodox Christian denomination, men are not permitted to enter a church the day after they have had sexual intercourse with their wives. People who are ritually unclean may approach the church but are not permitted to enter it; they instead stand near the church door and pray during the liturgy. Pope Dionysius of Alexandria taught that with regard to menstruating women that \\"not even they themselves, being faithful and pious, would dare when in this state either to approach the Holy Table or to touch the body and blood of Christ.\\" As such, Oriental Orthodox Christian women, such as those belonging to the Coptic Orthodox Church, are not permitted to receive Holy Communion while they are menstruating. While the Roman Catholic Church has condemned religious circumcision for its members, and currently maintains a neutral position on the practice of non-religious circumcision, it is customary in Coptic Christianity, Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Eritrean Orthodox Church, which keep it as a rite of passage.  Christian dietary laws and fasting  In the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, an Oriental Orthodox Christian denomination, washing one's hands is required before and after consuming food. This is followed by prayer, in which Christians often pray to ask God to thank Him for and bless their food before consuming it at the time of eating meals, such as breakfast. The wording of these mealtime prayers vary per Christian denomination, e.g. the common table prayer is used by communicants of the Lutheran Churches and the Moravian Church. Vegetarianism was widespread in the early Church, among both the clergy and laity. Being traditionally viewed as a luxury, many Christians may choose to practice vegetarianism as their Lenten sacrifice during the penetential season of Lent in the Christian kalendar. With respect to meat consumption, in Oriental Orthodox Christianity, in denominations such as the Armenian Apostolic Church and Ethiopian Orthodox Church, slaughtering animals for food is done with one strike in the name of the trinitarian formula (cf. Jhatka). Meat consumed by Christians should not retain any blood. The Friday Fast from meat is observed by Christians of the Catholic, Methodist and Anglican traditions, especially during the season of Lent in the Christian kalendar. The Baptist, Methodist and Pentecostal traditions of Christianity prohibit the consumption of alcohol (cf. teetotalism). On the other hand other Christian denominations condone moderate drinking of alcohol, including the Catholic, Lutheran and Eastern Orthodox traditions. However, all Christian Churches, in view of the Biblical teaching on drunkenness, universally condemn drunkenness as sinful.  External apparel  headcoverings when praying and worshipping. In Christianity, communicants of the Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox Churches are expected to wear a cross necklace at all times; these are ordinarily given to believers at their baptism. In many Christian denominations, such as the Oriental Orthodox Churches and Old Ritualists of the Russian Christian tradition, women wear headcoverings when praying and worshipping. In denominations of the conservative holiness movement such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Evangelical Wesleyan Church, when in public, women are enjoined to wear clothing with sleeves extended past the elbows and \\"Women's hemlines are to be modestly below the knees\\" (cf. outward holiness).

Initially a merchant vessel named San Giorgio, she was acquired by the Navy and used to train non- commissioned officers between 1952 and 1958. Since 1963 she has been preserved and exhibited at the Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci in Milan.  Sea-going career Construction of the vessel began in December 1918, in the Benetti shipyard in Viareggio. She was launched on 21 August 1921 under the name of San Giorgio. At first she was used for short sea shipping between Genoa and Torre del Greco. In 1937 she was equipped with an auxiliary motor that provided a speed of 4 knots in case of lack of wind. In the late 1930s and early 1940s she often transported various goods along the Cagliari - Napoli - Genoa route, covering short distances over a period of a few days. She also made occasional voyages to North Africa, transporting goods. At the outbreak of World War II San Giorgio was requisitioned by the Italian Royal Navy and converted into a minesweeper. After the war she reverted to use as a cargo ship. In 1952 the Italian Navy bought the San Giorgio and converted her into a training vessel under the name Ebe. The hold was converted to accommodate students, the ship was fitted with a new auxiliary motor, and the bow was decorated with a figurehead in the shape of a mermaid. From 1953 to 1956 the Ebe carried out training voyages in the Mediterranean, Tyrrhenian and Adriatic seas. Replaced in 1958 by the training ship Palinuro, the Ebe was assigned to the base in Portoferraio and from 1960 fell into disuse. Transferred to La Spezia to be broken up, she was purchased by the Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci in Milan. In 1963 the shipyards in Le Grazie, a town near La Spezia, began the recovery of the hull. This was transported to Milan along with other elements and was reassembled inside the Air and Water Building of the Museum, where it is still preserved and exhibited today.  Museum ship  In January 1963, the ship was towed from the arsenal of La Spezia (Marola) to the Argocarpentieri shipyard in Le Grazie. Here, Museum and shipyard technicians cut the hull into 90 different parts of about 10 tons each, which were then transported by lorry to Milan. The transfer of the bow (minus the bowsprit to make it lighter) was the most complex. Unlike other loads, which were transported along the Cisa pass, the bow was transported on a low trailer. It followed an alternative route that was supposed to encounter higher bridges that should have sufficient clearance to allow passage. Despite these precautions, the convoy encountered an overpass that prevented the cargo from passing through. A group of Museum technicians with minimal equipment reached the place on that same night and managed to cut off the top of the bow, allowing the convoy to continue its journey to Milan. The Air & Water pavilion at the museum in Milan was specially designed by architect Nichelli to accommodate 1,000 tons of the deck of the ocean liner and the entire hull of Ebe with all her masts. The ship was placed on a 30 meter long reinforced concrete beam supported by pillars able to bear more than 1,000 tons. The last parts to be removed, such as the keel, were the first to be relocated. The reconstruction lasted until the end of 1963. All the rigging and sails were remounted by old toolmakers from Castellammare di Stabia, who were recalled for this operation. In 1963, during the installation of the ship and the stepping of the mainmast, engineer Guido Ucelli di Nemi (President of the Museum) placed a gold coin under the mast step, as was common in ancient times when the construction of a ship was completed. The Ebe and the rest of the Air & Water Transport pavilion of the museum were inaugurated on 12 April 1964 in the presence of the President of the Italian Republic Antonio Segni.

ISWAN is the result of a merger between two organisations. These were the International Committee on Seafarers' Welfare (ICSW) and the International Seafarers Assistance Network (ISAN). ICSW was formed in 1973 and ISAN was established in the late 1990s. These two welfare bodies merged in April 2013 to form ISWAN. ISWAN's headquarters are in Croydon, Greater London. ISWAN promotes seafarers welfare worldwide. ISWAN is a membership organisation with the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), The International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) and the International Christian Maritime Association (ICMA) as core members. Any maritime organisation that is involved with setting standards for welfare for seafarers is eligible to join. ISWAN runs a welfare service SeafarerHelp. ISWAN also runs the Seafarer Emergency Welfare Fund, produces health information for seafarers, and provides information on the location of seafarer centres. ISWAN works with its members for the implementation of the ILO Maritime Labour Convention 2006, which is designed to provide workers rights and standards in the maritime industry. In August 2015 ISWAN merged with the Maritime Piracy Humanitarian Response Program (MPHRP) and this is now a program under the ISWAN banner. There is an Emergency Fund for survivors of piracy and their families that is co-ordinated by the MPHRP.  Funding  ISWAN is funded by membership subscriptions, grants from foundations, sponsorship, and earned income.  Research and projects  ISWAN engages in studies, research and projects related to seafarer welfare, including conditions on board ships, health and gender issues. These include: * Women Seafarers' Health and Welfare survey was conducted with International Maritime Health Association, the ITF, and Seafarers Hospital Society in 2015 * HIV/Aids pilot project * Port Levies and Sustainable Welfare conducted in 2013 * International Port Welfare Partnership project in conjunction with the International Transport Workers' Federation Seafarers' Trust (ITFST) and managed by the Merchant Navy Welfare Board (MNWB).  Events and Activities  ISWAN runs events during Seafarer Awareness Week as part of The International Maritime Organisations' (IMO) Day of the Seafarer day which is recognised by the United Nations as an official international day. The International Seafarers' Welfare Awards are an annual event funded by the ITF Seafarers' Trust. Other supporters involved include the IMO, International Chamber of Shipping, and the International Labour Organisation amongst other maritime bodies. The awards have four main categories- Seafarer Centre of the Year, Port of the Year, Shipping Company of the Year and the Dierk Lindemann Welfare Personality of the Year. The awards are designed to recognise good practise in seafarer welfare. The Day of the Seafarer is a 2016 event for Filipino seafarers and families, and will be held in Manila. The previous Day of the Seafarer event was called 'Party in the Park', and was held in Manila in 2010.

Hedvig Maria Tesch (1850‚Äì1936) was a Swedish professional photographer who had a studio in Link√∂ping. As a result of her productive and highly successful business, thousands of her photographs remain in the collections of the local museum and county library. Biography Born in Eksj√∂ in 1850, Tesch moved to Link√∂ping in 1873 where she opened a studio in a building on the corner of Drottninggatan and Nygatan. It was so successful that a few years later she was able to buy the property. As a result of her increasingly well-known reputation, people from the city and its surroundings visited her for portraits which can still be found in many family albums. Thanks to her enormous capacity for work, Tesch was able to enlarge her premises, engage several employees and open a branch in Eksj√∂. One of her tricks in making good photographs was to get people to smile by shouting \\"Look happy, think of the one who's going to get the photograph,\\" before she disappeared behind the black curtain. She ran the Link√∂ping studio until 1917 when she ceded it to Anna G√∂ransson. By the time she died on 5 April 1936, Tesch had run up a considerable fortune. She left it to the Link√∂ping Association for the Aged () and to charities in Eksj√∂.

Built in 1911 to a design by Boston architect James Thomas, it is the only significant example of Mediterranean Revival architecture in Kennebec County. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Guy P. Gannett House stands on the west side of State Street (United States Route 201) in the city's Capitol Complex. It stands just north of The Blaine House, the official residence of the Governor of Maine, and is owned by the state as part of a buffer around that property. It is a basically square 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a hip roof that has deep eaves showing exposed rafter ends, stuccoed exterior walls, and a granite foundation. Single-story porches extend to the north and south, and a two-story ell extends to the rear. The front facade faces east, and is symmetrically arranged. It is three bays wide, with a single-story porch extending across the center bay. The main entrance is at the center, with flanking sidelight windows. The porch is supported by Tuscan columns, and has a metal balcony railing above. Windows in the side bays are three-part, with narrow side elements flanking larger central ones in a Palladian style. The house was built in 1911 to a design by Boston architect James Thomas. It was built for Guy P. Gannett, one of the most important figures in Maine's newspaper publishing industry. The house was a showcase of modern conveniences of the period, including electric light fixtures, and an elevator for bringing firewood up from the basement. It also has an early example of a whole house vacuum cleaning system. At the time of its listing on the National Register in 1983, it housed the state's planning office. The building changed hands in recent years and is now home to the First Amendment Museum. http://www.FirstAmendmentMuseum.org/ See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Kennebec County, Maine References Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Augusta, Maine Category:Houses in Augusta, Maine Category:Historic district contributing properties in Maine Category:Houses completed in 1911 ","title":"Guy P.

Career Bailey‚Äôs expertise includes the discovery, development, and commercialization of biological weed control technologies as biopesticide products. She is an expert on biological characterization, mass production systems for fungus, enhancement of fungal metabolite production, formulation and delivery of bioproducts, and knowledge of regulatory requirements in North America (Pest Management Regulatory Agency, Canada; Environmental Protection Agency, United States). She researches methods to reduce weed and plant disease pests through integrated pest management strategies to promote ecologically balanced cropping systems. Currently, her projects include the development and evaluation of microbial agents for biological control of weeds, and the development and initial assessment of bio-pesticides and biological agents against weeds. In collaboration with Russell Hynes, Wes Taylor, Frances Leggett, and Claudia Sheedy at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Bailey recently developed a patented bioherbicide to control broadleaved weeds in turfgrass. The indigenous fungus Phoma macrostoma was formulated to control weeds such as dandelion, clover, wild mustard, and ragweed, without harming crops and grasses. It can be applied as a granule to soil before the weeds emerge, which prevents establishment for 1-3 months, or applied post-emergence, which causes affected weeds to turn white and die due to a lack of chlorophyll. Bailey has also been involved in numerous scientific projects in the U.S., Syria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, India, Switzerland, and Belgium.

It is home to the Evangelical Margaretenkirche and the Catholic St. Antonius Kirche.  History  Voxtrup, Teufelssteine (Devil‚Äôs Stones) ‚Äì part of the Route of Megalithic Culture The Evangelical Margarethenkirche in Voxtrup Voxtrup was first mentioned in records in 1088; however the earliest record only survives in the form of a transcription from the 14th century. It contains a legal notice stipulating that a nobleman named Eberhard was to transfer possession of an estate in Bevern to bishop Benno II in return for a payment of three pounds; its land would become part of the grounds of the Iburg monastery. The transaction was ultimately completed after the death of Benno, under his successor, Bishop Markwart. The case was heard at a place named ‚ÄúVockestorp‚Äù. The court in Voccastorp (as it was named in a record dated 1090) was presumably located on the Mahlbrink around the area of the Gelshorn estate (today the Waldhof estate). Today‚Äôs Voxtrup finds its origins in the farming settlements of Molenseten, D√ºstrup, Hickingen and a settlement with the same name. In a record from 1147 the four settlements were named as a coherent body. It is almost certain that Voxtrup, D√ºstrup and Hickingen predate their first written records. Settlements are strongly believed to have existed in these areas in prehistoric times. The first estates in the farming settlements of D√ºstrup, Voxtrup and Hickingen had probably existed long before the Saxon-Westphalian regions were incorporated into the Frankish empire towards the end of the 8th century. Voxtrup is believed to have been named after the Fokko family. The district was originally home to three (or possibly five) separate estates: Arling, H√ºdepohl, Werries, Brockmann and Strickmann. Voxtrup was incorporated into Osnabr√ºck on 1 July 1972.German Federal Statistical Office (ed.), Historisches Gemeindeverzeichnis f√ºr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland.

Sport  The sports club ‚ÄúVfR Voxtrup‚Äù has existed since 1927, and today offers a wide range of sporting activities: namely badminton, football, basketball, mountain biking, tennis, table tennis, gymnastics, volleyball, basketball and hiking.  Volunteer fire brigade  The Osnabr√ºck-Voxtrup volunteer fire brigade (Freiwillige Feuerwehr Osnabr√ºck-Voxtrup) was founded in 1938, and today is based at Holsten- M√ºndruper-Stra√üe in the heart of the district. Its fleet is currently made up of five modern emergency vehicles, three of these being large ones. Alongside standard firefighting the volunteer fire service has the additional duty of providing technical assistance at the scene of traffic accidents. The ELW 2 emergency control vehicle is utilised with the support of colleagues from Haste and the Neustadt; this is classified as special water transport and is well-equipped to provide expert technical aid, especially in the areas of building collapse and saving individuals buried under rubble. Alongside the emergency division there is also a youth fire brigade, established in 1983.

Characteristics  The car's body was made of precious woods, using aluminium foils on a sturdy frame consisting of a rectangular structure made of steel tubes, with a second tubular frame positioned inside the first. The technical solution of a double chassis made sure that, in case of impact, the deformations of the first would not be transmitted to the second, safeguarding the mechanical parts, engine and transmission. Other technical characteristics: Chassis: Double chassis made of steel tubes. Engine: De Dion Buton, single cylinder 942 cm3. Ignition: Crank ignition, directly on engine. Settings: The levers on the steering column regulate the flow of fuel, oil and air into the carburetor. Transmission: Cardan shaft drive fitting the rear axle. Brakes: Drum brake only on rear wheels. Cooling system: Water-cooling system with vane-based heat exchanger in the front of the car. Transmission: Two-speed and reverse gear. As in modern cars there is a clutch pedal and a gear box. Suspension system: The semi-elliptic leaf springs act directly on the axles. Colouring: red body with golden finishings and black fenders.  History  In 1901, Edoardo Bianchi worked hard to design this elegant car. Bianchi was the founder of the popular Milanese bicycle company F.I.V. Edoardo Bianchi. In 1903, when Bianchi turned to car-building, these were among the first cars in the world to travel the streets of cities, which until then were only populated by carriages, wagons, pedestrians and a few horse-drawn or steam trams. These cars were built with precious materials, for wealthy clients. At the beginning of the 1900s, one would cost around 10,000 Italian lire, corresponding to ten years of a doctor‚Äôs salary. The price included two days of driving school for inexperienced drivers, a wrench, a roll of duct tape, and an air pump. The most skillful Italian coach builders, cabinet- makers and carvers were employed to customize these small motorised coaches, respecting the taste of the individual owners. Bianchi offered six different models between 4,5 and 12 HP.  References  * Milleruote enciclopedia Milleruote, grande enciclopedia dell'automobile 1974 Rozzano * Rogliatti G.

The mayor and councillors are all due for re-election in October 2016. =National government= Pohonui-Porewa, like the rest of the Rangitikei District, is located in the general electorate of Rangitƒ´kei and in the MƒÅori electorate of Te Tai HauƒÅuru. Rangitƒ´kei is a safe National Party seat since the 1938 election with the exception of 1978‚Äì1984 when it was held by Bruce Beetham of the Social Credit Party. Since 2011 it is held by Ian McKelvie. Te Tai HauƒÅuru is a more unstable seat, having been held by three different parties since 1996, i.e. New Zealand First, the MƒÅori Party and the Labour Party. Since 2014 it is held by Adrian Rurawhe of the Labour Party. Education Due to its sparse population, the area itself does not have any schools. However, as Hunterville and Taihape are enclaves of Pohonui-Porewa children attend school mostly in those two locations. These include a number of primary schools and one secondary school, Taihape Area School. Demographics Pohonui-Porewa had a population of 2,031 according to the 2013 New Zealand census. This is a decrease of 48, or 2.3 percent, since the 2006 census. There were 810 occupied dwellings, 153 unoccupied dwellings, and 3 dwellings under construction.

Transport =Roads= State Highway 1 goes through the central and eastern parts of the area, beginning just before Taihape in central northern Pohonui-Porewa and continuing down through Mangaweka and Hunterville as it leaves the area on towards Lake Alice. The North Island portion of this national state highway begins at Cape Reinga and ends at Wellington International Airport. =Public transport= InterCity runs several daily and non-daily services throughout the area. These routes include: Auckland‚ÄìWellington, Wellington‚ÄìAuckland, Tauranga‚ÄìWellington and Wellington‚ÄìTauranga. The area used to be serviced by the North Island Main Trunk (or Overlander), a railway line connecting Auckland and Wellington.

When this default occurred, Euphoria‚Äôs obligations were guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Euphoria Media (Ireland) Limited, and a director of the company, Simon R. Smith. Mr Smith made a number of payments under his contractual obligations, but the payments still fell short of what the company needed in order to service its own obligations and its operations were suspended in September 2014. The company continued with its efforts to secure payments from Mr Smith via legal action, that found him guilty of his obligations to the company both in Malta and in England and the efforts by the company produced judgments in the company‚Äôs favour in both countries. Mr. Smith made some payments to repay the majority of employees, after leaving staff unpaid for several months in 2014. When enforcement was made in the UK in 2017 this led to Mr Smith declaring himself bankrupt in August 2017 after failing to make further payments to the company. The closure of TRC Family Entertainment caused a political storm, between the Malta Labour Party and the Nationalist party. The Economy Minister Chris Cardona asked the opposition to shoulder responsibility for investing in TRC despite due diligence exercise. Former finance minister Tonio Fenech said the due diligence had not concluded that any one of the directors had been involved in criminal activities, but there was a period in one of the directors life about which there was no information. The Prime Minister Joseph Muscat added that the director had a history of unsuccessful business ventures. He also highlighted that although in businesses bankruptcy was always a risk, the opposition had access to the due diligence report. During its initial period of operation, conflicts between the management and the employees frequently rose to very high levels with the result that productivity was initially impaired.[1] A new management team was subsequently appointed to head the project and continue with operations with good progress being achieved until the default by Euphoria Media (Ireland) Limited and Simon R. Smith in 2014.

The shell is ovate and conical. The spire is composed of six slightly convex whorls, somewhat flattened at their upper part, ornamented with longitudinal, spinous folds. The body whorl supports two or three rows of spinous, distant tubercles. Besides, the whole shell is crossed by pretty fine, transverse striae, more apparent towards the base. The aperture is sub-rounded. The outer lip is margined externally, and striated internally. The color of this shell is grayish, with irregular transverse bands of a slate or violet color. The tubercles are sometimes white, and often brown lines cross them. Kiener (1840).

Designed in Neo-Georgian style by architect Edwin Lutyens, it is a Grade II* listed building. It was converted into apartments in 1997. The gardens are Grade II listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Country house =Owners= The name Nashdom is romanised Russian (), meaning \\"our home\\".Dunstan (2009), p. 64. Lutyens' clients were Prince and Princess Dolgorouki. Prince Alexis, a son of Prince Serge Dolgorouki, was formerly the chamberlain in the Russian court. In 1898 he married Frances, the only daughter and heiress of the Scottish shipping magnate Fleetwood Pellew Wilson, of Wappenham Manor, Northamptonshire. The couple's British residences included Braemar Castle, Aberdeenshire, and a house in Upper Grosvenor Street, London. The Princess wanted an additional residence, for royal guests and house parties.Amery and Richardson (1981), pp. 121‚Äì2. Lutyens visited the site in July 1905, thinking it beautiful but a very difficult one for the Princess's ideal house,Brown (1982), p. 168. which he thought would cost ¬£20,000. Her initial budget was only ¬£6,000, and they finally agreed on a design costing ¬£15,000.Brown (1982), p. 159. Sources differ on the house's completion date, ranging from 1908, to 1911. The Prince died, aged 68, in June 1915. Thereafter, the Princess lived in Pyr√©n√©es- Atlantiques, France, where she died in August 1919, aged 69. In her will, she left Nashdom for the use of the Dolgorouki family, under the stewardship of Serge Alexandrovitch Dolgorouki, aided by her executor, Herbert Brisbane Ewart. =Architecture= Entrance, 1921 Lutyens built the house in Neo- Georgian style, using whitewashed brick. It is one of his earliest completely neoclassical buildings. To accommodate the steeply sloping site, he built a basement level under the southwest half of the house.Butler(1984), pp. 36‚Äì7. The northwest, entrance front had an urban appearance, built tight against the road. Massive and austerely neoclassical, it had at its centre a Doric colonnade giving into the entrance porch, directly beyond which was, not the main entrance door, but access via a wrought iron gate into a semicircular courtyard. Instead, the main door was inside the porch on the left, giving access to the entrance hall. A door in the porch on the right gave access to the service quarters.Pevsner, Williamson and Brandwood (1994), pp. 210‚Äì1. The entrance hall contained two staircases. The main one, straight ahead from the door and wide, led up to the Big Room, the main room for entertaining. A second staircase, at right angles to the first and wide, led towards the suite of rooms on the garden front, via a grand landing. The landing had a wind dial on the wall, showing the wind direction superimposed on a local map. It was connected to a weathervane on the roof. Southeast, garden front The southeast, garden front was much less severe than the entrance front, and has been called one of the most unusual facades of any Georgian house. Lutyens made extensive use of green-shuttered sash windows, spaced exceptionally close together. Along the garden front, starting from the eastern end, were a loggia, the Big Room, a circular drawing room fronted by a broad bow window, a glass-domed hall known as the Winter Garden, a dining room fronted by another bow window, and a smoking room. The bow windows continued up the facade, and the circular drawing room was surmounted by a circular bedroom. There was a semicircular dip in the centre of the facade, probably in order to let light into the glass dome. Abbey =Origins= The Anglican Benedictine community of Caldey Abbey, Pembrokeshire, converted to Roman Catholicism in 1913, with the exception of a small Anglican remnant, which moved into Abbey House at Pershore Abbey, Worcestershire.Beattie (1997), p. 105. The new community was formally established in May 1914, though it had only one professed monk and two oblates.Dunstan (2009), p. 25. In 1915 the monk, Anselm Mardon, converted to Rome and went back to Caldey.Dunstan (2009), p. 31. Denys Prideaux, one of the oblates, was appointed warden,Dunstan (2009), p. 36. and in 1922 became the first abbot.Dunstan (2009), p. 46. The community soon found itself in need of more space. The Dolgoroukis' agent, Ewart, was a friend of the community, and alerted it to Nashdom's availability. The community bought Nashdom in May 1924 for ¬£8,000,Dunstan (2009), pp. 64‚Äì6. and moved there in September 1926.Dunstan (2009), p. 73. =Life= Abbey cemetery Nashdom Abbey was a centre of Anglican Papalism, and used the Roman Rite. Its leading exponent in this was the liturgical scholar Gregory Dix.Jones, Simon in Dix (2007), p. xii of Introduction. He joined the community in 1926, just before the move from Pershore, and in 1948 became prior. He died in 1952 and was buried in the abbey cemetery. The composer and musicologist Anselm Hughes was Nashdom's director of music, 1922‚Äì45, and prior, 1936‚Äì45. He died at Nashdom in 1974.Humphries and Evans (1997), p. 173. Another member of the community, Bernard Clements, became a broadcaster and the vicar of All Saints, Margaret Street, London.Rees (2000), pp. 28‚Äì30. =Daughter priory= In 1935, Nashdom started the training of a group of American Episcopalians led by Paul Severance. In 1939, they founded St Gregory's House, later known as St Gregory's Priory, in Valparaiso, Indiana. In 1946 the priory moved to Three Rivers, Michigan. It remained a dependency of Nashdom until 1969, when it became St Gregory's Abbey.Beattie (1997), p. 171. =Relocation= In 1987, the shrinking community left Nashdom for Elmore Abbey, near Newbury, Berkshire, where they built an abbey church, completed in 1995. Justin Welby, who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury, was a regular visitor to the abbey from the early 1990s, and became an Anglican Benedictine oblate in 2004. In September 2010 the remaining four monks moved again, into the Principal's House of Sarum College, in the close of Salisbury Cathedral, Wiltshire. In June 2011, they gained planning permission to build an extension to the house, including an oratory. Apartment complex The wind dial in 1921 Nashdom and its outbuildings were converted into an apartment complex in 1997. The house was turned into 15 apartments. Although the interior was much changed, the wind dial on the landing was kept, together with a bust of Princess Dolgorouki. The complex includes a swimming pool, tennis court and gym. Gardens There are of grounds, forming a long, south-pointing triangle, with the house at the northern end. The southeast, garden front of the house overlooks the main lawn. A massive retaining wall, high, topped by a balustrade, runs along the southwest edge of this lawn, with a great stone stairway descending in two flights to the former west lawn, now a car park. From the top of the stairway, a straight path (originally stone terracing) runs southeast, along the top of the retaining wall, and another runs northeast along the house's garden front, leading to a circular, walled rose garden. View from south, 1921, showing the retaining wall and stairway From the main lawn, a central path, originally an avenue lined with chestnuts, leads southwards into mixed woodland, underplanted with rhododendrons. The small abbey cemetery is among the trees. A number of Lutyens-designed features are Grade II listed buildings, including the rose garden wall, a stable, a gatehouse, and an alcove at the northern end of the former chestnut avenue.

Gurunagar is also known as Karaiyur (). The suburb is divided into two village officer divisions (Gurunagar East and Gurunagar West) whose combined population was 3,520 at the 2012 census. The suburb is mainly populated by Catholic Sri Lankan Tamils, engaged in sea activities. The village is known in Jaffna due to its maritime history and also served as the western sector of the Jaffna Kingdom.  Etymology  Gurunagar, also spelled as Kurunagar derives its words from Kuru and Nagar (Urban centre in Tamil). The word Kuru is a clans name used by the Karaiyars also known as Kurukulam, who make up majority of Gurunagar. Karaiyur, as it was earlier known as stems from the Tamil words Karai (coast) and Ur (village). Karaiyur was marked in the Dutch maps as Cereoer.  History  Old map of Jaffna, depicting the settlement of Gurunagar near the Jaffna fort. The earliest settlers of Jaffna, were according to local legend, a musician and his kinsfolk. The surmised place they first settled is in the area surrounding Gurunagar and Colombuthurai. The Columbuthurai Commercial Harbor situated at Colombuthurai and the harbor known as ‚ÄòAluppanthy‚Äô situated previously at the Gurunagar area seem as its evidences. The navy of the Aryacakravarti dynasty were manned and officered by the people of Gurunagar. The Pattinathurai of Gurunagar was a port for foreign vessels. It is surmised that it was here the Moroccan explorer Ibn Battuta, saw fleet of ships that belonged to the Aryacakravarti kings. The Maniagar and Adappans of Gurunagar served as one of the headmen of the Jaffna ports. The western section of the Jaffna Kingdom was allotted by the Karaiyars of Gurunagar. There existed a smaller fort in Colombuthurai and one at Pannaithurai near Gurunagar. In 1560, the Portuguese forces with 77 ships arrived in Gurunagar and defeated the Tamil army governing there before proceeding further to Nallur. The Cathedral of Jaffna in Gurunagar was constructed over an already existing smaller chapel. The chapel was constructed as the place where the Jaffna king Cankili I killed his own son for converting to Catholicism. Starting from the early 1920s, was the Gurunagar land reclamation scheme started, starting from modern Beach Road to Reclamation Road.

It preserves an area of savannah parkland on the border of the Amazon rainforest. The conservation unit is rich in lakes and ponds, and serves as a nursery for various species of fish. Location Conservation units in the Purus-Madeira interfluvial. 23\\\\. Cuni√£ Ecological Station The Cuni√£ Ecological Station is in the Amazon biome, and covers . It covers parts of the municipalities of Canutama and Humait√° in the state of Amazonas and Porto Velho in the state of Rond√¥nia. 90% of the Rio Madeira Sustainable Yield Forest (C) overlaps with the ecological station. The terrain bordering the Madeira River alternates between floodplains and lacustrine plains formed by accumulated sediments. Further from the Madeira are the terraces of the Cuni√£ and Aponi√£ rivers. Much of the station to the north west is interfluvial plateau with very poor drainage. Average annual rainfall is . Temperatures range from and average . The environment is rich in lakes and ponds, and serves as a nursery for various species of fish. Vegetation is Savannah parkland rather than regular Amazonian forest. It is classified as open tropical rainforest, with spaced-out individual trees and many clusters of palms, bamboos and lianas. It provides a favourable environment for wildlife. Relatively abundant fauna include paca, tapir, armadillo, deer, macaw and heron. Aquatic species include cichla, arapaima and pterophyllum. There are said to be some Amazonian manatee in the interior lagoons. Conservation The Cuni√£ Ecological Station was created on 27 September 2001, modified on 21 December 2007 and again modified by law 12.249 of 11 June 2010. It is administered by the federal Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). It is classed as IUCN protected area category Ia (strict nature reserve). The purpose is to protect the headwaters of the Aponi√£ and Cuni√£zinho streams, tributaries of the middle Madeira River, with ecosystems in the transition from Savannah to Forest, and to support development of knowledge about the biodiversity of the Amazon region. The villagers of S√£o Carlos and Nazar√© often enter the unit at will and make use of the natural resources, since there are poor controls. An ordinance of 9 January 2012 provided for a consistent and integrated approach to preparing management plans for the conservation units in the BR-319 area of influence. These are the Abufari Biological Reserve, Cuni√£ Ecological Station, Nascentes do Lago Jari and Mapinguari national parks, Balata-Tufari, Humait√° and Iquiri national forests, and the Lago do Capan√£-Grande, Rio Ituxi, M√©dio Purus and Lago do Cuni√£ extractive reserves. The Cuni√£-Jacund√° Integrated Management (GICJ: Gest√£o Integrada Cuni√£-Jacund√°) is a proposed management organization that would take responsibility for three federal conservation units in Rond√¥nia, the Cuni√£ Ecological Station, Jacund√° National Forest and the Lago do Cuni√£ extractive reserve. All three are managed by ICMBio and have complementary objectives in maintaining a total of of Amazon biome and its transition to savannah.

Boyer was the head coach women's basketball coach at Arkansas State University for 20 years and compiled an overall record of 333-287. He won more games than any coach (men's or women's) in the school's history. Early life and education Boyer was born in Memphis, Missouri, a small farming community in the Northern part of the state. He attended Missouri Western where he earned a bachelor's degree in Physical Education in 1993. Coaching career =Missouri Western= Upon arriving at Missouri Western as a student, Boyer began working as assistant with the men's program in 1989 and moved to assistant with the men's program in 1993. During his time at Missouri Western, the Griffons made five NCAA Division II appearances (1990, 1991, 1992, 1994 and 1995) and captured two conference championships and advanced to the Sweet 16 in 1990 while with the men's program. After moving into his role with the women's program, Missouri Western and Boyer continued their joint success as the program made two NCAA Tournament appearances, including a trip to the Elite Eight in 1994 and a Final Four berth in 1995. =Arkansas State= In 1995, Boyer arrived at Arkansas State as an assistant under Jeff Mittie, who is the current head coach of the Kansas State Wildcats. Upon Mittie's departure in August 1999 to become the head coach at TCU, Boyer was promoted to the position of head coach. In his first season as head coach in 1999‚Äì2000, Boyer guided A-State to an 18-12 overall record and a second straight trip to the Women's National Invitation Tournament. His teams returned to the postseason in 2003‚Äì04 and 2004‚Äì05, both of which resulted in appearances in the WNIT.

Service The 51st Pennsylvania Infantry was organized in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and mustered in November 16, 1861 for a three-year enlistment under the command of Colonel John F. Hartranft. The regiment was attached to Reno's Brigade, Burnside's North Carolina Expeditionary Corps, to April 1862. 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, Department of North Carolina, to July 1862. 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, IX Corps, Army of the Potomac, to April 1863. Army of the Ohio to June 1863. Army of the Tennessee to August 1863, and Army of the Ohio to April 1864. 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, IX Corps, Army of the Potomac, to September 1864. 1st Brigade, 1st Division, IX Corps, to July 1865. The 51st Pennsylvania Infantry mustered out July 27, 1865. Detailed service This regiment was recruited during the summer and fall of I86I by Col. Hartranft for three years' service, most of the officers and men having served for the three months' term. Cos. A, C, D, F and I were recruited in Montgomery county; E, H and K in Union and Snyder; G in Centre and B in Northampton. The place of rendezvous was Camp Curtin, Harrisburg, and the regimental organization was completed on Nov. I6 I86I. Two days later it left for Annapolis, Md., where it remained, perfecting itself in drill and discipline, until Jan. 6, 1862, when it was assigned to the 2nd brigade (Gen. Reno), Burnside's corps, embarked as a part of Burnside's expedition to North Carolina, and landed at Roanoke island on Feb. 7. It shared in the capture of the enemy's works here on the 8th and was active at the battle of New Berne, N. C., in March, where it executed a gallant charge. It was again active in the battle of Camden, losing 3 killed and 21 wounded. It returned to Fortress Monroe in July and was assigned to the 2nd brigade, 2nd division, 9th corps, Gen. Ferrero commanding the brigade. It was active at the second Bull Run and Chantilly, and in Sept., 1862, moved with the 9th corps on the Maryland campaign. It skirmished with the enemy's cavalry at Frederick, Md.; was hotly engaged at South mountain and again at Antietam, where its losses were 125, including Lieut.-Col Bell, and Lieuts. Beaver and Hunsicker killed; Capts. Bolton and Hart, Adjt. Shorkly, Quartermaster Freedly and Lieut. Lynch wounded. Maj. Schall was now promoted to lieutenant-colonel, and Capt. Bolton to major. The command suffered severely in the fierce fighting at Fredericksburg in December, its losses being I2 killed and 74 wounded. It was ordered to Fortress Monroe in March, 1863, brigaded with the 51st N. Y., 2Ist Mass., and IIth N. H., and moved thence, with two divisions of the 9th corps, to Kentucky, being posted successively at Winchester, Lancaster, Crab Orchard and Stanford. In June it moved with its corps under command of Gen. Parke to the support of Grant at Vicksburg, arriving on the I4th and going into camp at Mill Dale. It was employed here and at Oak ridge for several weeks in building fortifications, and joined Sherman in his campaign to Jackson in July. The command then returned to Kentucky, encamping at Camp Nelson, where it rested and refitted after its arduous service in Mississippi. The regiment moved from Camp Nelson to Crab Orchard, where a number of recruits were received, and thence to Knoxville, Tenn. It was active at the battle of Campbell's station, and suffered all the hardships endured by Burnside's army, when besieged in Knoxville by the enemy under Longstreet. After the siege was raised it joined in the pursuit of the enemy, skirmishing with his rear-guard at Rutledge, and later went into winter quarters at Blaine's cross-roads, where the men suffered much from the meager supplies of food and clothing received. On Jan. 5, 1864, the regiment reenlisted for a term of three years and returned to Pennsylvania on 30 days, veteran furlough. While at home the command was rapidly recruited to the maximum strength, as it was a very popular organization, and on the expiration of its furlough it proceeded to Annapolis, where it was assigned to the Ist brigade, Ist division, 9th corps, Col. Hartranft commanding the brigade and Lieut.-Col. Schall the regiment. The 5Ist participated in all the sanguinary engagements leading up to the siege of Petersburg, losing heavily. Dating from the battle at the Ny river, May I2, Col. Hartranft was promoted to brigadier-general, Lieut.-Col. Schall became colonel, Maj. Bolton lieutenant-colonel, and Capt. Hart major. In the fierce fighting at Cold Harbor Col. Schall was killed while leading a charge and was succeeded in command by Lieut.-Col. Bolton. The command arrived in front of Petersburg on the I7th and at once engaged the enemy. It was in action again the next day, capturing and holding a position close to the enemy's works. This position was so exposed that a constant fire was kept up, night and day, for more than two weeks, one-third of the men being constantly employed to hold the position. It formed part of the assaulting column at the explosion of the mine, but was ordered back before it entered the crater. In this advance, Col. Bolton was severely wounded and Maj. Hart succeeded to the command. The regiment remained on duty in front of the crater for a few days, when it was relieved, and remained encamped in the rear until Aug. I9. It shared in the movement for the capture of the Weldon railroad, and participated in all the subsequent operations of the brigade, including the engagements at Poplar Spring Church, Ream's station, Hatcher's run, and the final assault on Petersburg, April 2, 1865. It was mustered out at Alexandria, Va., July 27, 1865, after four years of most trying service. Casualties The regiment lost a total of 314 men during service; 12 officers and 165 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded, 137 enlisted men died of disease. Commanders * Colonel John F.

Previously, Beruff was a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2016, but lost the Republican primary. He was a gubernatorial appointee to the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport Authority, the Southwest Florida West Management Board, and the State College of Florida board. Beruff was born in Miami, Florida, to Cuban-immigrant parents. Medallion Home In 1984, Beruff founded Medallion Home, a home builder located in Bradenton, Florida. Gubernatorial appointments In 2009, then-Florida Governor Charlie Crist appointed Beruff to the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport Authority, the Southwest Florida Water Management board, and the State College of Florida board. The next governor, Rick Scott, reappointed Beruff to all three positions. In the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Florida, Beruff supported Charlie Crist, who was running as an independent and later became a Democrat, over Republican Marco Rubio. =Resignation from Southwest Florida Water Management District board= In August 2015, Beruff resigned from the Southwest Florida Water Management District board after voting to approve a friend's plan to destroy an acre of wetlands for a development. An administrative law judge recommended against issuing the permit, which allowed developer Pat Neal to remove mangroves and fill wetlands in order to build a family compound on Perico Island. 2016 U.S. Senate campaign Beruff ran for the U.S. Senate seat in Florida, mounting a primary challenge to Republican incumbent Marco Rubio in the 2016 election. Beruff has proposed temporarily halting immigration to the United States from Middle Eastern countries. In May 2016, Beruff was criticized for referring to President Barack Obama as \\"an animal\\". Beruff declined to issue an apology for the comments. He lost the August 30 primary, getting 18.49% of the vote and 264,427 votes.

Mellon Chief Librarian, a position inaugurated in 1990. Education Born in the Dutch colony of Java and raised in Hong Kong, Sanger received her early education at the Peak School and the British Central School. After the outbreak of World War II, her mother Lonni Wheeler Sanger, born Louise Wernicke in 1891 in Berlin, relocated to the United States with Helen and her two sisters, Charlotte and Eleanor. Helen attended the University High School in Oakland, California, and the Walnut Hill School for Girls in Natick, Massachusetts, before matriculating to Smith College. She graduated in 1946 (cum laude), having taken courses in economics, history, art history, and art and design. In 1953, she was awarded a M.S. in Library Science from Columbia University.Prokop, Ellen (September 23, 2020). \\"Remembering Helen Sanger, Frick‚Äôs First Mellon Chief Librarian.\\" Discoveries: A Library Blog. The Frick Collection and Frick Art Reference Library. Retrieved September 25, 2020. Career Sanger's first position at the Library was in the Photoarchive, but she later transferred to Public Services. She was appointed the Chief Librarian of the Library in 1978, taking over the position from Mildred Steinbach. Sanger contributed to and edited Katharine McCook Knox‚Äôs The Story of the Frick Art Reference Library: The Early Years, which was published in 1979, and in 1981, she established the Library's Conservation Department. After the death of the Library's founder Helen Clay Frick in 1984, Sanger oversaw the merger of the Library with The Frick Collection.Prokop (2020). She also managed \\"The Spanish Project,\\" the Library's response to the United States government's general request to American research institutions to initiate \\"major international projects\\" that would strengthen ties between the United States and Spain in preparation for the Columbian Quincentenary in 1992.Frick Art Reference Library, New York (1993). Spanish Artists from the Fourth to the Twentieth Centuries: A Critical Dictionary. Volume I: A-F. New York: G.K. Hall, p. vii. The project initiated by the Library had three aims, all of which were supervised by Sanger: to complete an annotated checklist of more than 7,000 Spanish artists active between the fourth and twentieth centuries; to hone the skills of graduate students from Spain and the United States in art-historical research and introduce them to database creation; and to augment considerably the Photoarchive's holdings in Spanish art.Frick Art Reference Library, New York (1993), p. vii. Sanger retired in 1994, although she continued to volunteer at the Library for the next several years. Family Helen was the sister of Eleanor Sanger Riger (1929‚Äì1993), an Emmy-award-winning television writer and producer and the first woman network sports producer. Helen and Eleanor had an older sister, Charlotte (Lonni) Sanger Ward, who died on August 12, 1955.

Life  Barbara Bain grew up in Australia and was educated in Maryborough, Queensland. She took the exams of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. She went to England in late 1971 to further her career abroad,EHA Hematology: Interview with Barbara Bain and after some time back in Australia, in Brisbane, returned to the UK. One reason for choosing haematology as her speciality was that it combined laboratory and clinical work. Influential mentors in her career were Sir John Dacie, David Galton and, later on, Daniel Catovsky.Barbara J. Bain - Bloodmed profile She says her main interests are diagnostic haematology, writing and teaching. She has published various teaching materials and frequently-reissued textbooks as well as numerous other academic writings. She was part of the International Working Group on Morphology of MDS and also in the group which devised the 2008 WHO classification of tumours of the lymphoid haematopoietic systems. She has translated two editions of an Italian work on the morphology of the blood,Giuseppe d'Onofrio, Gina Zini, trans. B.J.Bain Morphology of the blood, Butterworth-Heinemann 1998 and gives Italian as one of her hobbies. Art history, visiting art galleries and the study of St Sebastian are other interests of hers.

Its molecule can be described as that of ethanol, with the three hydrogen atoms in position 2 (on the methyl group) replaced by bromine. It is a white crystalline solid, soluble in water and other solvents, that absorbs strongly in the UV below 290 nm. Tribromoethanol is used in medicine and biology as an anesthetic, and has been available commercially for that purpose by the trade name Avertin. It was formerly used on humans and is still often used on laboratory animals, and to capture wild birds. It is also used in plastics industry as a polymerization initiator. Uses =Animal anesthetic= Tribromoethanol is often used to anesthetize laboratory animals, particularly rodents, before surgery. As a solution in tert-amyl alcohol, it has the brand name Avertin. The tert-amyl alcohol acts as a weak hypnotic, in addition to improving the solubility of the tribromoethanol. Administered intravenously, tribromoethanol (Avertin) causes rapid and deep anesthesia followed by rapid and full postoperative recovery in small mammals. Recently its safety for this purpose has been questioned.Robert E. Meyer and Richard E. Fish (2005) \\"A review of tribromoethanol anesthesia for production of genetically engineered mice and rats\\". Lab Animal, volume 34, pages 47‚Äì52. =Wildlife capture= Tribromoethanol has also been long used as spiked grain bait to capture wild turkeys for research and wildlife management purposes.Ronnie R. Evans, John W. Goertz and Clifford T. Williams (1975): \\"Capturing wild turkeys with tribromoethanol\\". Journal of Wildlife Management, volume 39, issue 3, pages 630-634. However, the birds learn to avoid it, for over a year, after a single exposure, and will drive other flock members away from the bait when they detect it.J. Rickie Davis, David C. Guynn, Jr. and Bryan D. Hyder (1994): \\"Feasibility of using tribromoethanol to recapture wild turkeys\\". Wildlife Society Bulletin, volume 22, issue 3, pages 496-500. =Human anesthetic= In the first half of the 20th century, Avertin was also used in humans as a general anesthetic or basal narcotic to induce unconsciousness prior to the administration of other anesthetic agents. It was administered rectally as a retention enema or by intravenous injection. Its rectal use was particularly favored for pediatrics, head or neck surgery, or in mentally unstable or anxious patients. Electrophysiology studies showed that tribromoethanol acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the inhibitory GABAA and glycine receptors, a mechanism similar to that seen with the related compound 2,2,2-trichloroethanol. Bromal hydrate (2,2,2-tribromoethanol-1,1-diol), a compound also recognized to produce general anesthesia in animals, is metabolized to tribromoethanol. =Polymerization initiator= Tribromoethanol can be used as a functional polymerization initator for the introduction of Œ±-hydroxyl groups in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBAK).G.

Biography  Jihad Mughniyah was the son of Hezbollah commander Imad Mugniyah, a Lebanese Islamist who fought against Israel and the United States in the Middle East in a series of Guerrilla warfare. He was of Lebanese Shia Muslim descent. Jihad was born in Tayr Dibba, near Tyre. He was the third child of Imad Mughniyah. in 1991 his family, without Imad Mughniyah, went to Iran for security reasons. Later they came back to Lebanon and began their life in South Lebanon. Jihad Mughniyah became well known in Iran by sharing his pictures of him standing behind Qasem Soleimani in Soleimani‚Äôs mother‚Äôs funeral. In 2008, his father was killed in a car bombing in Damascus, Syria at a party as part of an apparent joint Mossad-CIA operation. Mughniyah proclaimed his allegiance to new Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah a week after the assassination of his father, blaming Israel for the killing. Some sources says he was one of Hassan Nasrallah's bodyguards. Mughniyah became a senior commander of Hezbollah and the fact that he pledged allegiance to the main leader of the group strengthened the resolve of the organization. Mughniyah planned for a massive attack on Israel at the same time as the Syrian Civil War including infiltration, shooting, assassinations, suicide bombings, anti-tank attacks, and missile attacks with the intent of killing and kidnapping IDF soldiers, as well as establishing a missile base in the Quneitra region on the border of Syria's Golan Heights. Death On 18 January 2015, days after Nasrallah declared that Israel's airstrikes in Syria meant that the Syrian Arab Republic and its allies had the right to respond, an Israeli helicopter attacked Mughniyah's positions in the Quneitra Governorate of Syria, killing him and five other Hezbollah commanders, including Mohamad Issa, when they were reportedly driving in a convoy alongside Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) troops near the Israeli- occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah retaliated on January 28 by firing anti-tank missiles at an IDF convoy on the Shebaa Farms, killing two IDF soldiers.

The NSW Greens State Conference prior to the 2011 NSW State Election adopted a resolution in support of BDS. In support of the statement, Senator Lee Rhiannon said it was \\"motivated by the universal principles of freedom, justice and equal rights\\" and also \\"I see the value of that tactic as a way to promoting Palestinian human rights.\\" Following the election, Federal leader Bob Brown said that he had conveyed his disapproval of this policy emphasis to Rhiannon. In December 2011, the NSW Greens reviewed their support for the BDS campaign against Israel, bringing the branch more closely in line with the federal Greens Party position. However, they did vote to support BDS as a \\"legitimate political tactic\\". Rhiannon said that this was not a defeat, but rather, \\"The resolution recognizes the legitimacy of the BDS as a political tactic.\\" =Oppose= In October 2011, Izzat Abdulhadi, head of the General Delegation of Palestine to Australia said that he is against the \\"full-scale\\" BDS campaign, and condemned the occasionally violent protests at the Max Brenner stores in Australia, saying, \\"BDS is a non-violent process and I don't think it's the right of anybody to use BDS as a violent action or to prevent people from buying from any place.\\" In New South Wales in 2011, Walt Secord of the Labor Party's NSW Legislative Council, called on the NSW Minister for Police, Michael Gallacher, to \\"provide assurances for the protection of businesses with Israeli links\\" after two BDS protesters were arrested outside a Max Brenner store. Also in New South Wales, on 19 April 2011, Marrickville municipal council held a fiery meeting over whether to support the global BDS campaign.

In August 2012, Liberal MP David Southwick said in parliament that Labor MP Martin Foley had links to BDS group through union membership. Foley responded by saying \\"I seek his withdrawal of these comments where he has sought to associate [me] with this racist, anti-Semitic and anti- Israel boycott movement.\\" Following the incident, Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that the \\"campaign does not serve the cause of peace and diplomacy for agreement on a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine\\", and added that Australia has always had firm opposition to the BDS movement. Others, including former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, also condemned the protests in a follow-up article by the Australian discussing protests at the University of New South Wales.

It concentrates on cultural boycott by appealing to international personalities, artists and academics who consider visiting Israel. The \\"Who Profits?\\" project is another Israeli group involved in the BDS campaign that documents and publicizes how profits are made from the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, including documentation of who benefits from the occupation.

Some Jewish factory managers who employ Palestinian labor have condemned the boycott, claiming a boycott of Israeli products will result in the loss of Palestinian jobs. The Netherlands The lower house of the Dutch Parliament passed a motion on 18 March 2014 undermining the concept of BDS. It came in response to the support of BDS by water company Vitens. Kees van der Staaij of the Reformed Political Party and Joel Voordewind of the ChristianUnion jointly submitted the motion.

South Africa The University of Johannesburg has issued conflicting stances toward BDS. In 2011, it voted not to renew a joint agreement with Israel's Ben-Gurion University for research in biotechnology and water purification. A campaign before the vote cited BGU's cooperation with the military, occupation and apartheid. The vote did not preclude faculty members from individually choosing to continue in the joint project. However, two days after the vote, Vice Chancellor Ihron Rensburg, a principal of UJ, stated that \\"UJ is not part of an academic boycott of Israel. ... It has never been UJ's intention to sever all ties with BGU, although it may have been the intention of some UJ staff members.\\" On 31 August 2012, the Wits University Students' Representative Council (Wits SRC) adopted a declaration of academic and cultural boycott of Israel. Several days later, the Executive Committee of Wits Convocation, representing the alumni and academic staff of the university, distanced itself from the declaration. The South African Union of Jewish Students, sharply criticized the resolution, calling it \\"a vicious and one-sided resolution aimed at shutting down all debate and discussion surrounding the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict\\". In March 2013, eleven student BDS supporters at the Wits University were charged by the university after they forced the cancellation of a concert by Israeli pianist Yossi Reshef. They were subsequently sentenced by the university to community service. At a follow up concert held on 28 August 2013, which featured Israeli jazz saxophonist Daniel Zamir, dozens of BDS protesters gathered outside. Due to security measures implemented by the University, the protesters were unable to disrupt the performance, as they were kept from entering the venue.\\"Student BDS supporters sentenced for disrupting Israeli pianist\\", Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), 22 January 2014.

After further criticism from the Spanish government as well as Jewish organisations, the organisers apologised to Matisyahu re-inviting him to perform on Saturday August 22.

A Lethal Obsession: Anti-Semitism from Antiquity to the Global Jihad. New York: Random House, 2010. p. 404 The motions to AUT Council were prompted by the call for a boycott from Palestinian academics and others. The AUT Council voted to boycott Bar-Ilan because it runs courses at colleges in the occupied West Bank (in Ariel College) and \\"is thus directly involved with the occupation of Palestinian territories contrary to United Nations resolutions.\\" It boycotted Haifa because it was alleged that the university had wrongly disciplined a lecturer. The action against the lecturer was supposedly for supporting a student who wrote about attacks on Palestinians during the founding of the state of Israel (he withdrew the claims when sued for libel and the University denied having disciplined the lecturer). The boycott, which was not compulsory, was set to last until Haifa \\"ceases its victimisation of academic staff and students who seek to research and discuss the history of the founding of the state of Israel\\" and by Universities UK. After both internal and external backlash and condemnation, members of the AUT, headed by Open University lecturer Jon Pike ‚Äì gathered enough signatures to call a special meeting on the subject. The meeting was held on 26 May 2005, at Friends Meeting House in London. At the meeting the AUT decided to cancel the boycott of both Israeli universities. Reasons cited for the decision were the damage to academic freedom, the hampering of dialogue and peace effort between Israelis and Palestinian, and that boycotting Israel alone could not be justified. At the 2006 annual conference of the United Kingdom lecturers' union, the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE), members were asked to support a motion calling for a boycott of Israeli academics and universities that did not distance themselves from \\"apartheid policies\\". Although the motion was passed it ceased to be official policy just two days later when the union merged with the Association of University Teachers. Prior to the NATFHE debate the Federation of Unions of Palestinian University Professors and Employees and the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel described the campaign in a letter to the Times Higher Education Supplement as \\"the only non-violent forms of action available to people of conscience the world over\\" adding, \\"We salute those who recognise that, since justice for Palestinians cannot be expected from the international centres of world power, they must organise to further the cause of justice and genuine peace.\\"Steven Weinberg and Palestinian academics, \\"A Nobel laureate and Palestinian academics on Natfhe's proposed boycott of Israel\\", Times Higher Education Supplement, 26 May 2006, p. 16, No. 1744.

This home is free of products produced in Israeli settlements.\\" In March 2009, large scale student demonstrations were held at several UK Universities to protest Israel's actions in Gaza. At Cardiff University the protests led to the University divesting all investments in BAE Systems, an arms manufacturer that co-operates with Israel. In May 2009, advertisements for tourism in Israel were removed from the London underground network in response to pressure from the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign. In July 2009, Dexia, a Belgian-French financial group, stopped all financial services to Israeli settlements in the West Bank. In 2009, the UK's University and College Union passed a resolution to boycott Israeli academics and academic institutions by a large majority. Delegates stated that Israeli academics were complicit in their government's acts against Palestinians. However, the vote was immediately declared invalid as UCU attorneys repeated previous warnings that such a boycott would likely trigger legal action against the union. In 2013, \\"a motion calling for blanket sanctions against Israel was rejected by the Oxford University Students' Union.\\"\\"Oxford students reject boycott Israel motion\\". Jewish Journal 27 February 2013. Retrieved 27 February 2013. The motion was defeated by a large margin: 69‚Äì10. In 2014, Leicester City Council passed a motion which supported BDS in boycotting goods originating from illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank to oppose \\"continuing illegal occupation\\" of Palestinian territory and the treatment of Palestinians by the Israeli government. Other councils that have implemented boycotts supporting BDS include Swansea Council (2010), and Gwynedd Council (2014). Legal action against the councils brought by Jewish Human Rights Watch (JHRW) was subsequently dismissed by both the High Court and then the Court of Appeal in July 2018. The councils were all cleared of anti-Semitism over the Israeli goods boycott. The lead judgment given by Lord Justice Sales stated that the council's motion condemned 'certain actions' of Israel's government yet still recognised the state of Israel's right to exist. He said, \\"The condemnation was in line with a respectable body of opinion, including the UK government, the United Nations General Assembly, the European Union and the International Court of Justice.\\" He added, \\"the criticism made was temperate and legitimate.\\" Lord Justice Floyd and Lord Justice Underhill supported his decision. The judgment also stated that similar judgments were a \\"well-known gesture of political solidarity with oppressed groups overseas, as illustrated by calls for boycotts of goods from South Africa during the apartheid era\\". Leicester City Council's barrister, Kamal Adatia noted, 'The ruling totally endorses Leicester's approach to handling this motion, and has made no change whatsoever to the way in which councils can pass such motions in future. The judgement is a landmark ‚Äì not for organisations like JHRW ‚Äì but for all local councils. It recognises their fundamental right to pass motions of this nature and makes it clear that they can, like Leicester, fully comply with their equality duties when doing so.' In July 2014, UK department store John Lewis removed all SodaStream products from all its shelves, amid growing pressure from the public and declining sales. John Lewis' Oxford Street, London, store has been the site of biweekly BDS protests for its sale of SodaStream products. SodaStream operates its primary manufacturing facility in an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank. Additionally, after two years of weekly BDS protests, SodaStream closed its Brighton store in July 2014. In November 2015, Boris Johnson, Mayor of London and Conservative MP, described proponents of a \\"so-called\\" boycott of goods and services, as well as other punitive measures such as sanctions or divestment of shares in Israeli companies, as \\"corduroy jacketed-academics... by and large lefty academics who have no real standing in the matter and are unlikely to be influential on Britain\\". He subsequently cancelled planned public events in the West Bank because of security fears, with suggestions that the charity that had invited him to the West Bank had withdrawn their invitation, and that Palestinian politicians had also refused to meet him. In February 2016, in response to the council's motion, the British government issued a procurement policy intended to prevent such boycotts. The policy was struck down in April 2020 after a legal challenge by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. United States Activist group Code Pink in Los Angeles, supporting Israeli boycotts, specifically targeting Israeli-owned Ahava, for the company's factory in the occupied Palestinian West Bank. Noam Chomsky opposes the formal BDS movement, but supports certain aspects of boycotting Israel. The prominent activist for Palestinian human rights stated he supports the \\"boycott and divestment of firms that are carrying out operations in the occupied territories\\" but the current BDS movement's \\"hypocrisy rises to heaven\\". He stated that the BDS campaign harms the \\"whole movement. It harms the Palestinians and it is a gift to the Israeli hardliners and their American supporters\\", because the BDS's \\"hypocrisy is so transparent... why not boycott the United States?.. Israeli crimes [are] a fragment of US crimes, which are much worse\\". He also argued that the Palestinian people don't support boycotting Israel and that the BDS movement is run by \\"one man NGOs\\" who falsely claim to represent the Palestinian people. In the same interview, he also criticized BDS founder Omar Barghouti for advocating a full boycott of Israel, despite having studied at Tel Aviv University. Despite his disdain for the formal BDS movement, he was among the academics who lobbied Stephen Hawking to boycott an Israeli conference. In a subsequent letter to Artists for Palestine, Chomsky clarified his position, writing \\"I've been involved in activities to hold Israel accountable for its international law violations since before the BDS movement took shape. While I have some tactical differences with the BDS movement, I strongly support the actions and continue to participate in them\\". Norman Finkelstein, a harsh critic of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory, has also expressed an ambivalent attitude towards BDS. He has supported economic boycott of Israel and said that BDS has the \\"right tactics\\", but that it needs to be \\"explicit on its goal\\" and that \\"the goal has to include recognition of Israel, or it won't reach the public\\". He is hostile towards the BDS movement in its current form, labeling it a \\"hypocritical, dishonest cult\\" led by \\"dishonest gurus\\" who want to \\"selectively enforce the law\\" and try to cleverly pose as human rights activists, whereas their real goal is the destruction of Israel. In addition, he said: \\"I'm getting a little bit exasperated with what I think is a whole lot of nonsense. I'm not going to tolerate silliness, childishness and a lot of leftist posturing. I loathe the disingenuousness.

A street there is named after him. Early life and education Bayly was born in London, Ontario, son of Benjamin Moore Bayly and Alice Seaborn. He grew up in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, where his father worked as a medical health officer.Stafford, David. Camp X, Lester, Orpen & Dennys, Toronto. p. 158-160. He studied electrical engineering at the University of Toronto, and lectured there on radio communications before graduation. He graduated in 1930 with a BA in Science. Career After graduation Bayly was hired as an assistant professor in the University of Toronto's Department of Electrical Engineering, lecturing on radio communication, and later became a professor there. During World War II, Bayly was recruited by William Stephenson's British Security Coordination(BSC) to help with Stephenson's transatlantic communications from New York to Britain. He soon set up the telecommunications centre, code named Hydra, at Canada's secret intelligence installation, Camp X, near Whitby, Ontario. Bayly (often called Pat) was assistant director, with a British army rank of lieutenant colonel. Hydra sent and received Allied radio signals from around the world. Encryption using existing equipment was very slow, so Bayly invented a much faster solution for the purpose, an offline, one-time tape cipher machine labelled the Rockex or \\"Telekrypton\\". A later version of the machine was used by British consulates and embassies until 1973.Exhibit card describing Rockex equipment in the \\"Enigma and Friends\\" exhibit at the Bletchley Park museum, September 2006 Rockex equipment invented by Benjamin deForest Bayly The Government of Canada states that Hydra provided \\"an essential tactical and strategic component of the larger Allied radio network, secret information was transmitted securely to and from Canada, Great Britain, other Commonwealth countries and the United States\\". The Hydra station was valuable for both coding and decoding information in relative safety from the prying ears of German radio observers and Nazi detection. Hydra also had direct access via land lines to Ottawa, New York City and Washington, D.C. for telegraph and telephone communications. The main transmitter was previously used as that of American AM station WCAU's shortwave sibling W3XAU, and upon severance of W3XAU in 1941, the transmitter was refurbished and became the transmitter for Hydra at Camp X. Other radio apparatus was purchased discreetly from amateur radio enthusiasts, brought to the building in pieces and assembled on site.\\"Hydra\\", in Lynn-Philip Hodgson, Inside - Camp X, 2000, pages 77-84. After the war, Bayly returned to work as a professor at the University of Toronto until 1950, when he set up his own company, Bayly Engineering Works, in the newly formed town of Ajax, Ontario. Soon after, Bayly served as the first Mayor of the town. As well as having a street in the town named after him, in 2016 a statue commemorating his life was commissioned by the town.\\" Ajax unveils statue of town‚Äôs first mayor Pat Bayly\\".

Early life Jane Findley was a native of Atlanta, Georgia. Her mother was a self-taught pianist, and one of her aunts ran a dancing school. As a young girl, Jane dreamed of becoming a ballerina, but was told that her feet \\"weren't right\\". Instead, she taught herself to play the piano (on a neighbor's piano, as her family did not own one). Although small in stature, Findley took up the double bass, a instrument and the largest of the string instruments, while attending Girls High School in Atlanta. She joined the local youth orchestra after studying the instrument for two years. After high school, she attended the University of Georgia. Career At age 16, Findley became a charter member of the Atlanta Youth Symphony Orchestra, making her debut on February 4, 1945. Two years later, after opening its ranks to adult musicians, the ensemble became the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra (ASO). Findley went on to serve as the ASO's Assistant Principal Bass, performing with the orchestra for a total of more than 71 years. For many years Findley was the only woman in the orchestra. She married Warren Little, the ASO's principal flute player, in September 1953. Mrs. Little, who stood in height, said that she was glad to have her husband, who was tall, carry her double bass around for her, while she carried his flute. According to Guinness World Records, Little holds the world record for longest tenure with a single orchestra. She set the record during a performance on February 1, 2016. The previous record holder was Frances Darger, who played violin for the Utah Symphony for 70 years, until her retirement in 2012. Little collapsed on stage while performing on May 15, 2016, as the orchestra played an arrangement of \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\"; she died later that day. She was undergoing treatment for multiple myeloma at the time. Her husband had preceded her in death in 2002, and she had no surviving immediate family members.

While the L√©o Marciano label is predominantly known for its womenswear, the company also ran a menswear line. The house had a notable following in France and Japan and was internationally distributed through its portfolio of retail stores. History The brand was founded by Algerian-born French couturier L√©o Marciano in 1966. Trained in industrial design, L√©o Marciano began a teaching career in drawing before shifting his direction towards garment design and opening his eponymous fashion house.

The press developed an increased interest in his creations as they became more elaborate and began to constitute collections of coordinates in Italian silks and exclusive prints, fine wools and English tweeds and flannels.

The label moved beyond its French borders as stand-alone stores and concessions opened internationally. In Paris, L√©o Marciano became the couturier of choice of women in politics; abroad, he dressed women in power notably Margaret Thatcher and Empress Farah Diba, as well as Princess Caroline de Monaco and a number of actresses such as the star of Orfeu Negro, Marpessa DawnLa Marseillaise.

Japan The L√©o Marciano brand was established in Japan with the help of French multinational P√©chiney Ugine Kuhlmann (PUK), which offered the brand the support needed to successfully develop commercial activities in Tokyo. In 1978, thirty-five boutiques opened throughout the country.

It was created by Simon Carlyle and Gregor Sharp and stars Arabella Weir, Alex Norton, Doon Mackichan, Jonathan Watson and Elaine C. Smith. Following a pilot broadcast in 2013, the first series began airing April 2016. A second series began airing on 21 November 2016. The show was recommissioned in December 2016 for a third series by BBC Two which aired in early 2018, as well as a Christmas special in December 2017. A fourth series was broadcast between January and February 2019. A fifth series is to commence filming in summer 2020, and set to air in 2021. Two Doors Down won the Best Comedy award at the 2017 Royal Television Society Scotland Awards.  Premise  Two Doors Down focuses on neighbours living side by side in a typical Glasgow suburb. BBC Scotland describes the characters as \\"not so happily living together\\" ‚Äì the neighbours are constantly visiting uninvited, and overstaying their welcome, at Beth and Eric Baird's house. Beth is often taken advantage of by her neighbours, frequently having to make tea, pour drinks and prepare food, while the remaining characters chat in the living room. Eric and Beth therefore try and avoid their neighbours as much as possible so they can enjoy some peace and quiet in their own home. The series creator, Simon Carlyle states, \\"Two Doors Down is about crazy neighbours. We‚Äôve all got them. They seem ok, but when you scratch the surface they‚Äôre a bit nuts.\\"  Cast and characters  = Main = * Alex Norton as Eric Baird * Arabella Weir as Beth Baird * Elaine C.

It was shot with all the crew and cast in a cramped, medium-sized living room. After the pilot was deemed successful, filming was moved to purpose-built sets in Dumbarton. Exterior scenes are filmed in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire. Series four was filmed in Avonbrae Crescent, Hamilton.  Critical reception  Two Doors Down has received mixed reviews. Writing for The Guardian, Ben Arnold said the pilot for the series was \\"a mundane set-up, not helped by a woeful lack of laughs.\\" Writing again for The Guardian at the beginning of the second series, Arnold called the series \\"woeful\\". The Arts Desk wrote that the series \\"owes an awful lot to both Abigail‚Äôs Party and The Royle Family, as well as socially awkward characters from any number of sketch shows, with equally broadly defined characters ‚Äì only without the bits that make you laugh out loud.\\" Writing for RadioTimes, David Butcher said \\"Sometimes Two Doors Down is so uneventful it almost vanishes\\" but called it a \\"nicely sour-edged sitcom\\". Conversely, writing for The Guardian, Zoe Williams said \\"this endearing ensemble BBC Comedy about a sort of Scottish neighbours has something-for-everyone humour.\\" Euan Ferguson wrote in The Observer in December 2016 \\"BBC Two's Two Doors Down has it all.

We establish that an image is totally balanced when the resultant force is located in the geometric center of the image.

It was their 29th consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football after they won promotion during the season 1945‚Äì46. They played their home games in the St. Jakob Stadium. F√©lix Musfeld was club chairman for the fifth consecutive period. Overview Helmut Benthaus was first team manager for the tenth consecutive season. There were a few ammendments to the team. Josef Kiefer, now coming to the end of his active career, went on to play for FC Breitenbach. Kiefer had been with the club for 12 seasons. Between the years 1962 and 1974 he had played a total of 355 games for Basel, 170 of these games were in the domestic league. He had won the championship five times and the Swiss Cup once. A number of other players also left the club, Te√≥filo Cubillas went on to Porto, Rudolf Wampfler to Fribourg, Peter Wenger went on to Nordstern Basel and Felix Tschudin moved on to local club SC Binningen. In an inwards directions Fritz Wirth joined on loan from Grenchen, Roland Sch√∂nenberger signed from Wangen bei Olten and Danish international Eigil Nielsen signed from Winterthur. Basel played a total of 51 games in their 1974‚Äì75 season. 26 in the domestic league, seven in the Swiss Cup, four in the Swiss League Cup, five in the Cup of the Alps and nine were friendly matches. The team scored a total of 123 goals and conceded 66. Basel won all nine friendly games, of which three were played at home and the other six away. The Nationalliga A season 1974‚Äì75 was contested under 14 teams. These were the top 12 teams from the previous 1973‚Äì74 season and the two newly promoted teams Luzern and Vevey-Sports. The championship was played in a double round robin. The champions would qualify for the 1975‚Äì76 European Cup, the second and third placed teams were to qualifiy for 1975‚Äì76 UEFA Cup and the last two teams in the table at the end of the season were to be relegated. Z√ºrich won the championship six points ahead of both BSC Young Boys who were second and Grasshopper Club who were third. Basel finished in fourth position with 31 points. They won 11 of their 26 league games, drew nine and lost six games. They scored a total of 49 goals conceding 33. Ottmar Hitzfeld was the team's top goal scorer with 13 league goals, Roland Sch√∂nenberger second top scorer with six, Peter Ramseier, Walter Mundschin and Walter Balmer each scored five league goals. The poor results in this and the two previous seasons were now also being reflected in the match attendances. Where as in the 1971‚Äì72 season each but one match had attracted more than 10,000 spectators, this season only two games were attended by more than 10,000 people. The average number of spectators had halved within just three years. In the 50th Swiss Cup tournament Basel played the round of 32 on 21 September 1974 away against Chiasso in the Stadio Comunale and in the round 16 away against Z√ºrich in the Letzigrund. The quarter-finals were two legged fixtures. Basel played the first leg on 30 October 1974 away in Stade de la Fontenette and the return leg on 3 November 1974 in the St. Jakob Stadium against √âtoile Carouge. Both games ended with a 2‚Äì1 victory and so Basel qualified 4‚Äì2 on aggregate for the next round. The semi-finals were played in March against Ch√™nois and was also a two legged fixture. In the first leg, played in Stade des Trois-Ch√™ne, Basel achieved a 4‚Äì1 victory and the second leg ended with a 2‚Äì1 victory. The final was played on 31 March 1975 in the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern against Winterthur. Otto Demarmels scored the opening goal for Basel, E. Meyer equalised and so the game went into extra time. Walter Balmer scored the winning goal for Basel after 115 minutes. Basel were Swiss Cup winners for the fifth time in the club's history. The Swiss League Cup ended for Basel in the semi-final as they were beaten 1‚Äì3 at home against Grasshopper Club. They had beaten Young Boys in the round of 32, Luzern in the round of 16, and Aarau in the quarter-final. Basel were not qualified to play European matches, but they played in the Coppa delle Alpi and won the group stage and thus reached the final, only to lose 1‚Äì2 against BSC Young Boys.

Adverse childhood experiences are defined as potentially traumatic experiences that can occur between the ages of 0 and 17. The movement is being driven by pediatric clinicians, educators, parents, policymakers and other child-serving professionals and advocates who are working to implement universal screening for adverse childhood experiences. Adverse childhood experiences can involve sexual, psychological, or physical abuse. ACEs have been linked to premature death as well as to various health conditions, including those of mental disorders. Resulting toxic stress has also been linked to childhood maltreatment, which is related to a number of neurological changes in the structure of the brain and its function. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study was the first large scale study to look at the relationship between ten categories of adversity in childhood and health outcomes in adulthood. Psychologists, politicians, therapists, educators, and countless other professionals interested in advocating for universal screening for ACEs while creating awareness of ACEs and possible treatments for their residual effects has resulted in the launching of a public health campaign Stress Health Public Education Campaign to bring greater attention to the problems implicated by stress and toxic stress in childhood.  Start of the ACE-aware movement  The ACE aware movement arose out of the need for a bidirectional effort to create a public health change, with both individuals and institutions/ government systems. Change on the individual level is essential, because individual change is self-directed. The institutions and government systems engagement is essential, because without the structure surrounding individuals changing, the very systems that are intended to help, can perpetuate the cycle of trauma.  International adoption of the ACEs model The U.S. ACEs list was created in 1997 when a study was conducted to examine different childhood traumas. From 1995-1997, the CDC Kaiser ACE study involved more than 17,000 people sharing their stories about their unforgettable childhood trauma experiences. They used this study to make a list of ACEs to determine and examine how these traumatizing experiences can lead to health issues and stunt developmental growth. ACEs are divided into three categories: abuse, household challenges, and neglect. Examples of ACEs include being exposed to abuse and neglect, violence in the family, mental illness, parental divorce or substance abuse. It is said to disrupt a child's development, leading to poor health outcomes and low life expectancy. In the UK in 2017 a study was made based on the original US study and presented together with recommendations for early intervention to the UK parliament. The World Health Organisation has designed a far more extensive screening questionnaire than the original US version, designed to be used internationally in order to relate adverse conditions to future developments in the hope of possible preventive interventions. In addition to the ACEs identified in the US questionnaire it includes questions related to such adverse experiences as warfare. The questionnaire is titled the Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ).  ACEs score  To determine someone's ACEs score, they answer the 10 Adverse Childhood Experiences questions relating to events prior to their eighteenth birthday. The questions are: 1\\\\. Did a parent or other adult in the household often or very often... Swear at you, insult you, put you down, or humiliate you? or act in a way that made you afraid that you might be physically hurt? 2\\\\. Did a parent or other adult in the household often or very often... Push, grab, slap, or throw something at you? or Ever hit you so hard that you had marks or were injured? 3\\\\. Did an adult or person at least 5 years older than you ever... Touch or fondle you or have you touch their body in a sexual way? or Attempt or actually have oral, anal, or vaginal intercourse with you? 4\\\\. Did you often or very often feel that ... No one in your family loved you or thought you were important or special? or Your family didn't look out for each other, feel close to each other, or support each other? 5\\\\. Did you often or very often feel that ... You didn't have enough to eat, had to wear dirty clothes, and had no one to protect you? or Your parents were too drunk or high to take care of you or take you to the doctor if you needed it? 6\\\\. Were your parents ever separated or divorced? 7\\\\. Was your mother or stepmother: Often or very often pushed, grabbed, slapped, or had something thrown at her? or Sometimes, often, or very often kicked, bitten, hit with a fist, or hit with something hard? or Ever repeatedly hit over at least a few minutes or threatened with a gun or knife? 8\\\\. Did you live with anyone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic, or who used street drugs? 9\\\\. Was a household member depressed or mentally ill, or did a household member attempt suicide? 10\\\\. Did a household member go to prison?  Long term effects of ACEs  According to the Center for Youth Wellness website, \\"Exposure without a positive buffer, such as a nurturing parent or caregiver, can lead to a Toxic Stress Response in children, which can, in turn, lead to health problems like asthma, poor growth and frequent infections, as well as learning difficulties and behavioral issues. In the long term, exposure to ACEs can also lead to serious health conditions like heart disease, stroke, and cancer later in life.\\" Adverse child experiences are equal to various stresses, and a serious adversity is defined as a trauma. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognises that prolonged stress in childhood can have life-long implications for the development of many diseases. Moreover ACEs can disrupt early brain development leading to the possible development of several disorders. WHO has designed a screening questionnaire to be used internationally in order to list adverse effects, and relate them to future developments in the hope of possible preventive interventions. The questionnaire is titled the Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ).  Additional Information  Sandra Bloom and Brian Farragher's book Destroying Sanctuary states in its introduction that 17th century philosophers like Descartes took apart the person and \\"turned over the body to physicians and the mind to philosophers and clergy,\\" and in the ACEs movement society is now trying to bring them back together. ACE Nashville has repurposed the acronym, ACE to stand for All Children Excel and is trying to raise awareness about adverse childhood experiences in Nashville, Tennessee.

These executives have typically served a number of years in a business environment in roles such as chairman, owner, CxO, SVP, VP or director. Their skills may be focused in one discipline or could be more broad based, depending on the role(s) they have served. Fractional executives may offer their services as an independent consultant or through a company that offers these types of services. They may also be known as Interim Executive, Contract Executive, Part-time Executive, Temporary Executive, Fractional Business Executive, On-Demand Executive or Executive-as-a-Service. Fractional executives are not consultants in the classical sense. While they bring the same or greater know-how and experience, they also take an active leadership role in the company that hires them. They implement, execute, and lead as it is customary for their permanent hire counterpart. Fractional management is in the end a particular declination of Interim & Temporary Management originated by the demand coming from small entrepreneurial companies (less than 10 mill. US$), for which a classical temporary manager may be redundant: see definition in Hr On Line, the Italian HR Directors association magazine. Specific definition and application cases have been discussed in a congress organised by the Italian HR Directors Association (AIDP) and the Italian Chief Financial Officers Association (ANDAF): the full summary is reported at https://www.adnkronos.com/lavoro/professionisti/2020/01/23/non-solo-temporary- alle-pmi-piace-fractional-management_4Xib3W8Rpjz1ITjcBdeNVP.html Fractional executives are not employees of a company or organization. Instead, they offer their services to many, which gives them exposure to different cultures and management styles. Fractional executives may have diverse perspectives if they serve many customers, their perspectives may also be further enhanced if they served multiple industries. Fractional executives may be hired on a project basis, for a certain period of time or in some cases on retainer. The advantages of hiring such professionals is their experience and that they don't require a full-time position. While fractional executives are highly skilled within their area(s) of expertise they may require time to get acclimated to new industries.

Manning, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held, 8‚Äì0, that the jurisdictional test established by ¬ß27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is the same as 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1331's. test for deciding if a case \\"arises under\\" a federal law.Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Manning, No. 14‚Äì1132, 578 U.S. ___, slip op. at 1 (2016).  Background  Greg Manning sued Merrill Lynch, which is the wealth management division of Bank of America, and other stock brokerage houses, for allegedly naked short selling of the common stock of a public company of which Manning owned two million shares. Manning and other former shareholders of the public company filed suit in New Jersey state court, alleging that Merrill Lynch's actions violated New Jersey law. Merrill Lynch made a motion to have the case moved to federal court, where Merrill Lynch and the other petitioners believed they would receive better treatment than in state court. In an opinion authored by D. Brooks Smith, the Third Circuit held that no federal jurisdiction existed, and directed that the case be remanded to state court. The Third Circuit's decision deepened a circuit split among the Second Circuit, Fifth Circuit and Ninth Circuit over the scope of ¬ß 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. = Defendants = Manning and the other shareholders sued several financial services firms, which included Merrill Lynch, Knight Capital Americas, UBS Securities, E-Trade Capital Markets National Financial Services LLC, and Citadel Derivatives Group. = Regulation SHO = Manning and the shareholders sued under New Jersey state law, claiming the naked short sales constituted illegal market manipulation, causing the value of their shares to decline. Manning and the shareholders alleged that Merrill Lynch and the other financial institutions consistently violated Regulation SHO, the federal law that regulates naked short selling of common stock. The Securities & Exchange Commission regulates short sales at the federal level: Regulation SHO, issued under the Exchange Act, prohibits short sellers from intentionally failing to deliver securities and thereby curbs market manipulation. However, Manning and the shareholders did not make a claim under federal law (i.e. the Exchange Act) and they did not file in federal court. They only referred to allegations of federal violations of Regulation SHO. They made only a state law claim of illegal market manipulation in a New Jersey state court. = State law claims = Manning charged Merrill Lynch and the other financial institutions with violations of the New Jersey Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, New Jersey Criminal Code, and New Jersey Uniform Securities Law. Manning's complaint also charged violations of the New Jersey common law of negligence, unjust enrichment, and interference with contractual relations.  Opinion of the Court  The court ruled unanimously that the case could be decided in state court even though there was an invocation of federal law, specifically the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Regulation SHO. Justice Elena Kagan wrote the majority decision where she engaged in a statutory interpretation of the 1934 Securities Act and held that Section 27 of the Act allows the state court to hold jurisdiction over the case. The court's majority decision did not rule on the merits of the Manning or the shareholders' case, only on jurisdictional issues. Kagan wrote that Section 27 confers exclusive federal jurisdiction under the Exchange Act in the same manner that \\"aris[e] under\\" confers exclusive federal jurisdiction pursuant to (the federal question jurisdiction statute). Kagan also wrote that Manning's claims all arose under state law and did not necessarily raise any federal issues, affirming the decision of the Third Circuit court (772 F. 3d 158). Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion, stating that Section 27 establishes a straightforward textual test. Since the complaint did not allege any such claims in that test, he agreed that the case should be decided in state court.Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Manning, No. 14‚Äì1132, 578 U.S. ___, slip op. at 1 (2016) (Thomas, J., concurring). Thomas wrote that Section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 \\"establishes a straightforward test: If a complaint alleges a claim that necessarily depends on a breach of a requirement created by the Act, ¬ß27 confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over that suit. Because the complaint here does not allege such claims‚Äîand because no other statute confers federal jurisdiction‚Äîthis suit should return to state court.\\"  See also  * Commodity Futures Trading Commission * Financial regulation * List of financial regulatory authorities by country * Securities Commission * Securities regulation in the United States * Stock exchange  References   External links  * Category:2016 in United States case law Category:Finance fraud Category:Merrill (company) Category:Short selling Category:United States securities case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court ","title":"Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v.

The manpower of the force was reported in 1982 to total approximately 2,100 agents.Nyrop, 1983, p. 203 Although customs and tariffs have reportedly been the Treasury Police's main concern, the force has also been \\"involved in antismuggling and anticounterfeiting activities, regulation of immigration and emigration and the issuance of passports,\\" as well as enforcing the laws related to narcotics and alcoholic beverage manufacture and sale. Tom Barry's 1990 Guatemala: A Country Guide also numbers the Treasury Police at 2,100 members, and states that although \\"not as large as the National Police, [the Treasury Police] enhances its influence by closely working with the army's G-2 intelligence command\\".Barry 1990, p. 50 The author states that the Civil Protection System (SIPROCI), a new police unit under the army's High Command coordinating the different law enforcement agencies, \\"was apparently created in an effort to avoid internecine conflicts between the various units\\".Barry 1990, p. 51 The author adds that SIPROCI was formed \\"in the wake of an ongoing dispute between the National Police and the Treasury over an incident in which the National Police arrested members of the Treasury Police who were linked to death squad killings\\". Counterinsurgency activities During the civil war, the Treasury Guard became increasingly involved in political police activities, operating with other police and security forces \\"by reporting suspicious movements or activities and, when necessary, supplement[ing] other forces in counterguerrilla actions\\". The Guardia de Hacienda were often referred to as the \\"little barracks\\" as they exhibited military discipline. Most guardsmen were former members of the army, Kaibiles (special forces) or the Policia Militar Ambulante (PMA). The Treasury Guard was an organization similar to the PMA in that most of its members had prior military experience. According to 1970 U.S. Army Area Handbook's description of the Treasury Police:Dombrowski 1970, p. 323 Involvement in human rights abuses An untitled mimeograph published in October 1979 by Guatemala's leading peasant group and indigenous rights organization - CUC (Committee for Peasant Unity)- denounced the Treasury Police \\"one of the most repressive of the police bodies in the country, above all in the Tierra Fr√≠a (\\"Cold Lands,\\" i.e.: highlands) and in the border areas, like San Marcos\\".McClintock, 1985, p. 161 The same description adds that the force changed from one of \\"simple employees\\" who demanded bribes when allegedly controlling contraband and the making of alcohol, to one of \\"control and repression\\" after it came under the control of the Ministry of the Interior in 1974. During the conflict, a special presidential intelligence agency headquartered within a telecommunications annex of the Presidential Palace (known as Policia Regional, La Regional or Archivos) maintained contacts within the security services known as confidenciales who could be called from provincial army garrisons to be sent to the capital for unspecified purposes. Treasury Police and National Police confidenciales could also be contracted either through provincial army commanders or by direct contact with provincial commanders of the police services. The confidenciales assembled in the capital using this system were often used in covert operations involving the use of \\"death squads\\". The role of Treasury Police personnel in carrying out government sanctioned political murders via the confidenciales system was revealed when two men in plainclothes - identifying themselves as members of the Secret Anti-Communist Army (ESA) - were captured by students after attempting to kidnap student- leader Victor Manuel Valverth. Both assailants were found to be card-carrying confidenciales; one was identified as an agent of Military Intelligence (G-2) and the other reportedly \\"carried a card issued by the Special Service (Servicio Especial) of the Treasury Police\\".Amnesty International, 1981, p. 153 Bibliography * Amnesty International. 1981.

Early life Brown was born at Heddon Pit House, Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland in 1717, the son of William Brown and Ann (or Agnes) Watson, the daughter of Lewis and Jane Watson of Throckley Pit House. William Brown senior was involved with local mines, though exactly how is uncertain. Lewis Watson died in 1732 and around then the Brown family moved the short distance from Heddon to Throckley, where they lived for the next forty or so years. William Brown senior then became the tenant of Throckley Colliery. William Brown the son worked in mines in the 1730s and 1740s, but again his activities are not known. However, he would have served his apprenticeship in the 1730s, perhaps with William Newton, for they were related through their connection to the Watsons or maybe with his father or his neighbour Richard Peck, and by the 1740s was gaining expertise in designing waggonways. Coal mines From around 1750 Brown worked as a viewer - the man with the technical expertise to develop a colliery and then to deal with the geological and water problems inevitable in a mine. He was responsible for all the machinery, the waggonways and had to be a competent surveyor He was expected to provide financial advice to the owners and to recruit, manage and retain the workforce needed to operate the mine. Like many viewers, Brown became a part owner of the collieries in which he worked. Besides Throckley Colliery, in which he owned a half share, Brown later had shares in both Shiremoor and its successor Willington, which were very successful and profitable enterprises. Over the next 30 years through a combination of his mining skills, the installation of steam engines for pumping and the creation of waggonways to deliver coal to the Tyne for transport he developed a number of new mines and seams at Throckley, Heddon, Hartley, Shiremoor, Walbottle, Willington and Wallsend, though he died a few months before the latter opened. He was one of those who helped win the High Main Seam, a six foot seam of high quality household coal to the east of Newcastle which was at a much deeper level ‚Äì around 600 feet - than the same seam to the west of the city and at one time had been thought unreachable because of the presence of water. His work was not just with coal mines as he had involvement in Yorkshire with copper mines at Middleton Tyas, near Richmond and lead mines at Grassington and in Swaledale. Brown was also concerned with technical developments within mines. There are claims that he was the first to introduce the screening of coals; he made attempts to mechanise the hewing process with a machine known as ‚ÄòWilly Brown‚Äôs Iron Man‚Äô; and he was senior viewer at Hartley Colliery when steam winding was introduced. Waggonways Waggonways ‚Äì the early railways with horses and wooden rails usually used to transport coal from mines to docks ‚Äì were important to mining development. They developed into complex networks, much like the iron railways of the nineteenth century; and, like these, they made possible a massive expansion of the coal industry. It is not known where William Brown gained his experience in waggonway construction, though the likely place was the network of waggonways leading to the staiths at Stella on the opposite bank of the River Tyne to Throckley. Brown was involved in planning and costing many developments, though the construction was done by contractors. He was particularly active in the Throckley area. The decision to make Throckley a seasale colliery ‚Äì producing coal for shipment by sea, particularly to London - justified the building of its first railway, opened in 1751. The Wylam Way ‚Äì an extension to this - was opened in 1756 and there were other additions as new pits opened in the Throckley and Walbottle area over the next few years. In 1758 a waggonway to his design opened a few miles north of the Tyne estuary from Hartley Colliery to the coast. Later in his career he was to design the important network of waggonways east of Newcastle, and others south of the Tyne such as the line from Harraton to the River Wear, those from Washington Colliery to both the Tyne and the Wear, and that from Beamish to Fatfield. In 1776 he surveyed the route for a waggonway which followed the edge of the Newcastle Town Moor to the Tyne, but it was not built. His work was not just limited to the North East - in 1754, he was commissioned by the Duke of Hamilton to provide a waggonway underground at Bo‚Äôness Colliery near Edinburgh. Steam engines From about 1750 until his death in 1782 William Brown was primarily recognised as the builder of Newcomen steam engines for pumping purposes. He built engines at some 20 collieries in the Great Northern Coalfield in Northumberland and Durham, as well as in other parts of England, and in Scotland and Ireland. The first Boulton and Watt engine in the Northumberland and Durham coalfield was erected at Byker Colliery in 1778 to assist with pumping, almost certainly commissioned by Brown. In this work he was associated with notable engineers of the eighteenth century, such as John Smeaton, James Brindley and Abraham Darby and his clients included dukes and earls as well as lesser gentry. Brown was responsible for the introduction of larger iron cylinders, eventually as large as 75 inches in size (and 10 feet long) compared to the 42 inch cylinders in use in 1750, which made more powerful engines possible. He realised the need for a plentiful supply of steam and built multiple boilers to improve this. He also used larger pipes ‚Äì the 24 inch wooden pipes for Benwell being three times the size commonly used. He obtained materials for engines from a variety of suppliers. The brass cylinders of the early engines were probably produced locally; the larger iron cylinders used later were mainly built at Abraham Darby‚Äôs foundry at Coalbrookdale. As Brown was closely associated with the Midlothian collieries in Scotland he would probably have had connections with the Carron Iron Works near Falkirk, and may have also acquired cylinders from there. The wrought iron plates for the boilers were probably produced locally by Hawks of Gateshead or Crowleys at Swalwell, then the largest iron manufactory in Europe. Personal life Brown married Mary Smith of Morpeth in 1741. They had seven children, two of whom died in childhood. These are remembered by a plaque on the south east wall of St. Andrew‚Äôs Church at Heddon on the Wall. Their eldest son, William Brown (1743 ‚Äì 1812) married Margaret Dixon at Stamfordham in 1770 and the couple had eleven children including Dixon ‚Äì later taking the surname Dixon too ‚Äì who was High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1827. William Brown died in February 1782 and is buried in Heddon churchyard ‚Äì the family gravestone showing a coat of arms. Sources * Turnbull, L.

Biography  A pastor's son, Michael Ranft was born in G√ºldengossa and went to school in Chemnitz. From 1720 he studied at University of Leipzig, where he received the degree of bachelor of philosophy. In 1724 he graduated with a master's. From 1725 he was steward to the Vice President of the Court of Appeal in Gr√∂ditz. In 1727 Michael Ranft succeeded Friedrich Wilhelm Preuser in the diaconate of the city of Nebra. The city council there promised to repair the apartment that Ranft had been allocated, which was dilapidated, but nothing was done until 1732 and Ranft repeatedly complained to the Presbytery of Leipzig. While he struggled along on an income of 150 talers at most and endured poor living conditions, Ranft conducted research on vampirism. His book, De masticatione mortuorum in tumulis (1728; On the Chewing of the Dead in their Tombs), dealing with cases of the dead who had supposedly devoured the linen in their coffins, is still regularly quoted in vampire literature. In 1749 became pastor in Gro√üstechau in the Principality of Altenburg, where he died in 1774. His sons Michael Gebhard and Christian Solomon Ranft were also pastors in Gro√üstechau or R√ºckersdorf. De masticatione mortuorum in tumulis Engraving Tractat von dem Kauen und Schmatzen der Todten in Gr√§bern Ranft recounts cases reported from Germany of dead persons devouring the linen and everything else that was in reach of their mouths, and claims that people who happened to be nearby would hear sounds as if of pigs growling and grunting. A particular case he mentions is that of Heinrich, Count of Salm, who after being declared dead was put in his grave, in the churchyard of the Abbey of Haute-Seille, while he was still alive. Witnesses claimed that they heard loud cries during the night at the place he was buried, and the next day they opened his tomb, disinterred him and discovered that he had gnawed the flesh of his arms. Other cases mentioned in the book date back to the year 1355. According to Ranft, in some places in Germany mounds of dirt were placed under the chins of the dead, while in other places a coin and a stone were placed in the mouth, and in still other places a handkerchief was tied tightly around the throat.

Early life and career Thomas Johns was born in Llanwrda, Carmarthenshire, on 26 November 1836. At the age of thirteen he was received into church membership at Tabor, Llanwrda, by Thomas Jones, the father to Brynmor Jones. He began to preach in 1858 and the following year he attended Llandovery School before training for the ministry at Brecon Theological College. His first pastorate was at Ebenezer. Caernarfonshire, now known as Deiniolen. Johns's ministry at Deiniolen was not without its challenges and his biographer Gwilym Rees claims that the congregation proved argumentitive and undisciplined. Rees also states that the source of contention was Johns's insistence on electing more deacons than some members of the congregation thought necessary and also his efforts to abolish certain traditions deemed incompatible with Christian belief. His ministry coincided with the 1868 General Election, when the Liberal candidate, Love Jones-Parry defeated the Conservative, who happened to be the son and heir of Baron Penrhyn. Johns was one of the few ministers to publicly support the Liberal candidate and he was outspoken in his efforts. At a meeting in Llanberis in October, attended by over a thousand people, Johns spoke alongside John Griifith (Gohebydd) and the candidate himself. The following month, at the village of Ebenezer itself, Johns proposed a motion that the constituency had been misrepresented for 72 years. Following Jones Parry's victory, the Congregationlaist journal, Y Tyst Cymreig, in an editorial recording the contribution of ministers to the victory, singled out Johns as one of the younger ministers who played a decisive role. Ministry at Llanelli In 1869, he received a unanimous invitation to succeed David Rees as pastor of Capel Als. The invitation was accepted, and thus began a connection with Llanelly which remained until his death. A new schoolroom was built early in his pastorate, and in 1875 a group of members were released to form a new church at Tabernacle, towards the cost of which Capel Als contributed a significant sum. Several hundred members transferred from Capel Als to the new church at Tabernacle, and it was hoped that this would ease the over-crowding at Capel Als, which suffered from poor ventilation and was uncomfortable especially when the chapel was full as it was for the Sunday evening service every week. In 1895, Capel Als itself was re-built at a cost of ¬£5,000. Johns played a prominent role in the establishment of the Welsh Congregationalist Union, of which he was president in 1890. Public life Johns did not confine his activities to the pulpit and became a leading member of both the Llanelly School Board and Carmarthenshire County Council. Thomas Johns died in September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. One of his last public acts was to declare his support for the war effort. He was buried at Llanelli Cemetery.

Biography =Early and family life= William Cabell Brown was born in Nelson County, Virginia, his father's fourth son and mother's third child; both parents his parents descended from the First Families of Virginia. His grandfather Alexander Brown emigrated from Scotland to Williamsburg, Virginia at age 15 and studied at the College of William and Mary before moving to Nelson County and marrying Lucy Shands Rives, of a long prominent family. Their only son (together with several daughters), Robert Lawrence Brown (1820-1880) likewise married women from prominent families: first Sarah Cabell Calloway (1820-1849, who bore him two sons and a daughter before her death), and then William's mother Margaret Baldwin Cabell (1826-1877). Robert Brown, a teacher as well as farmer and merchant, supervised young William's education at Norwood high school, as well as the Nelson County schools. William then moved to Alexandria, Virginia where he taught at the Episcopal High School, as well as attended Virginia Theological Seminary, but his father died shortly before his graduation in 1891. He married Ida Mason Dorsey (1866- ) of Baltimore, granddaughter of U.S. Senator James Murray Mason, and they had three surviving sons and two daughters (their first son dying at age three in Brazil). =Ministry= After graduation, Brown was ordained as a deacon by bishop Francis McNeece Whittle on June 26, 1891, and advanced to the priesthood on August 2, 1891. He then sailed as a missionary to Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. During his early years in Brazil's southernmost state, Rev. Brown translated the Bible and Book of Common Prayer into Portuguese.Office of the Director of the Overseas Department, Our Overseas Missions: Brazil (National Council of the Protestant Episcopal Church, June 1964) typescript p. 3-4 He also re-established a theological school to train Brazilians for the priesthood, as well as served many missionary congregations and established several parish schools under the leadership of fellow Virginian and VTS graduate, Rt.Rev. Lucien Lee Kinsolving. After Brazil's formal establishment as a missionary district in 1907, Rev. Brown also expanded the Anglican presence in the country's then capital, Rio de Janeiro, where he had previously occasionally served at chapels permitted under an 1810 English/Portuguese treaty under the guidance of the Anglican Bishop of the Falkland Islands. In 1908 Rev. Brown helped found that state's first Brazilian congregation, the Church of the Redeemer, and soon established Trinity Chapel in M√©ier (then suburb, now a neighborhood).1964 survey at pp.5-6 (the Anglican and Episcopalian congregations would only merge near 1965, when the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil or Igreja Episcopal Anglicana do Brasil became an independent member of the Anglican Communion) In 1914 Virginia's Episcopalians recalled Brown to serve as assistant bishop to Bishop Whittle's successor, Bishop Robert Atkinson Gibson, who had had a health scare. Five years previously, Rev. Arthur Selden Lloyd had been consecrated as Bishop Coadjutor (with power to succeed) to assist bishop Gibson, but had resigned the position after 14 months to become President of the Episcopal Church's Board of Missions. Upon bishop Lloyd's resignation, Rev. Berryman Green had twice been selected as bishop Gibson's assistant, but had each time declined. After his second declination (at the Special Council called to select Rt. Rev . Gibson's assistant), the clerical and lay delegates selected the absent Rev. Brown, although he had earlier declined the position of Bishop of the new diocese of Puerto Rico.Edward L. Bond and Joan R. Gundersen, The Episcopal Church in Virginia, 1607-2007 (Episcopal Diocese of Virginia, 2007), at pp. 131-132 =Episcopacy= Rev. Brown returned to Richmond for consecration in October, 1914.Bond and Gundersen, at pp. 131-132 Bishops Gibson of Virginia, Alfred Magill Randolph of the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia and missionary bishop Daniel S. Tuttle of Montana participated in the consecration. Bishop Brown ultimately succeeded Bishop Gibson, and focused on the diocese's schools during his relatively brief episcopate. In June 1920, the diocese formed the Church Schools Corporation, which purchased three existing boarding schools: St. Anne's in Charlotttesville, and in Richmond the Virginia Randolph Ellett School for Girls and the Chamberlayne School for Boys (renamed St. Catherine's and St. Christopher's schools). It then established St. Margaret's school in Tappahannock and Christchurch school in Urbanna, both in Virginia's Northern Neck. St. Agnes coeducational elementary school was founded in 1924 in Alexandria to complement the all-male Episcopal High School which bishop Brown well knew (but not incorporated into the Church Schools system until World War II, long after bishop Brown's death). Also, the parish school for African Americans in Essex County (the only high school for them in the area, and with five boarders by 1938) was renamed for Archdeacon John Moncure, who had died trying to save a student's life. In 1920, Osgood Memorial and St. Peter's school in Richmond also offered pre-schools and kindergartens as well as day care for African American working parents, and Calvary Mission school had just opened in Hanover County in 1919 (it was divested in 1938 and incorporated into the local public schools).Bond and Gundersen, at p. 133 Bishop Gibson's son in law, Dr. Edmund Lee Woodward, had also returned from missionary work in 1914, in his case as a medical missionary in China. During bishop Brown's episcopate, he became a major fund raiser for the diocese, and also built the vacation retreat called Shrine Mont in Orkney Springs, which was given to the diocese and consecrated by Bishop Brown in 1925. It allowed children from all the diocese's regions to attend summer camp, and exposed urban children to outdoor life, which reformers of the day thought counteracted unhealthy urban living.Bond and Gundersen, at p. 143 In 1926, Bishop Brown requested a coadjutor bishop before his first vacation since his consecration (a voyage to England which was a gift from the diocese). The council elected Henry St. George Tucker, who like bishops Brown and Lloyd had been a missionary as well as related to the First Families of Virginia. The son of Rt.Rev. Beverley D. Tucker of Southern Virginia (and Ana Maria Washington Tucker, the last Washington born at Mt. Vernon), Rev. Tucker had served in Japan since 1899 and had been consecrated missionary bishop of Kyoto from 1912-1923, although family circumstances required him to resign and move back to Virginia, where he was teaching at Virginia Theological Seminary.Edward L. Bond and Joan R. Gundersen, The Episcopal Church in Virginia, 1607-2007 (Diocese of Virginia 2007) p. 134 Death and legacy Bishop Gibson died of a heart attack while traveling in London, but his body was returned for interment in the cemetery of Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Richmond.

The incident became renowned as a scandalous example of wartime profiteering. Interest in the incident was revived in 1910 as an indictment of Morgan.[2]  The Affair  The weapons, known as \\"Hall's Carbines\\", were purchased by arms dealer Arthur M. Eastman in a deal negotiated with James Wolfe Ripley, Brigadier General and head of the US Ordnance Bureau, in June 1861. Subsequently, Eastman agreed to sell the weapons to Simon Stevens for $12.50 each, if Stevens would provide financing in the amount of $20,000 to allow Eastman to complete the purchase from the government. Stevens quickly negotiated a sale to field general John C. Fr√©mont for $22, promising to bore out the rifles to fifty-eight caliber. With the deal completed, Stevens obtained a loan of $20,000 from Morgan. The weapons were delivered to Eastman in August 1861, refurbished at a cost of approximately 75 cents each, and 2500 arms were delivered to Fremont by the end of August. Meanwhile, Stevens obtained a loan of $46,226.31 from another banker, Morris Ketchum, of which $37,500 were used to repay Eastman. Morgan was still owed $20,000, and was holding 2500 rifles as collateral. On Sept. 14, 1861, the US government paid for the first shipment, and Morgan released the remaining rifles for shipment to Fremont. A voucher in lieu of payment for the remaining funds due was sent to Morgan, who forwarded it to Ketchum.  Reaction and evaluation  By the time the second payment was due to be paid in September 1861, a scandal was developing. Ripley discovered that Fremont had purchased the rifles without his authorization, and he felt that Fremont had been overcharged. Ripley complained to the Secretary of War, and the matter was reported in major newspapers on September 26, 1861. By the next day, a House investigating committee was looking into the matter. In 1863, a Congressional Committee on Government Contracts was highly critical of the arms merchants, writing: \\"Worse than traitors in arms are the men who pretending loyalty to the flag, feast and fatten on the misfortunes of the nation, while patriot blood is crimsoning the plains of the South and bodies of their countrymen are moldering in the dust.\\" Interest in the affair was rekindled in 1910 with the publication of Gustavus Myers' History of the Great American Fortunes, which included a chapter on J. P. Morgan. The matter then became a cause cƒól√®bre, attracting a wide range of commentary. Myers said that the rifles were more likely to blow the rifleman's thumb off than they were to cause any damage to the enemy. An earlier version of the rifle was known to be subject to this problem. Gordon Wasson argued that there was no evidence Morgan knew that he was participating in a scheme to profit from the chaotic situation at the onset of the Civil War. However, Matthew Josephson had earlier asserted that Morgan certainly did know, because he had presented the government with a bill for $58,175 before he delivered the remaining rifles that were being held as collateral. Reviewing the evidence, Charles Morris concluded that it was \\"implausible\\" that Morgan did not know about the profitability of the endeavor. Jan Irvin pointed out that Gordon Wasson became vice president for public relations for J. P. Morgan after completing his book, which attempted to exonerate Morgan. As early as 1937, Wasson had been working to influence historians Allan Nevins and Charles McLean Andrews regarding Morgan's role in the affair, and then he used Nevins's report as a reference for his own book on the topic.Andrews papers, Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library.

History  Arkha () was a zamindari whose leader RamGulam Singh at the time of British held a title of a Taluqdar which was given by the British Administration. However, Arkha was one of many noble houses of Awadh which opposed the British. Arkha joined Rana Beni Madho Singh of Shankarpur in the struggle against the British Raj in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.

Education Lemmon was born in Norfolk, England in 1964 and grew up in Taverham and Poringland. He was educated at Norwich School (from 1976 to 1983), and then at Hertford College, Oxford, from which he graduated with a first class Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Biochemistry in 1988. He completed his PhD at Yale University as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Predoctoral Fellow supervised by Donald Engelman for research on the oligomerization of transmembrane Œ±-helices. Research and career Following his PhD, Lemmon was a postdoctoral researcher and fellow of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation at New York University in the laboratory of Joseph Schlessinger. Following his postdoctoral research, Lemmon was recruited to the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, where he gained tenure in 2001 and became Departmental Chair in 2008. He remains an Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics at University of Pennsylvania. Lemmon's research combines biochemistry and structural biology with cell biology, focusing on understanding molecular mechanisms of transmembrane signalling by cell-surface growth factor receptors such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and other receptor tyrosine kinases. With Kathryn Ferguson and others, he also played an important role in understanding the structure and function of the Pleckstrin homology domain in phosphoinositide signalling and elsewhere. Lemmon has made important contributions to the discovery of both normal and pathological activation mechanisms of growth factor receptors and the signalling networks that they engage within cells. He is also committed to exploiting this understanding clinically. These receptors and their downstream effectors are activated aberrantly in numerous cancers, and are important targets of cancer drugs. Lemmon's recent work has focused on the need to understand the biochemistry of oncogenic activation to use such drugs effectively. Before moving to Yale, Lemmon was George W. Raiziss Professor and Chair of Biochemistry and Biophysics in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. His research has been funded by the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and the Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs.Mark Lemmon's Lemmon serves on the editorial boards of several scientific journals, including Cell, Molecular Cell, Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Science Signaling.

The virus was first isolated in 2015 and shown to be around 0.2 micrometers in diameter with a double stranded DNA genome of 466 kilobases predicted to encode 451 proteins. Although classified as a nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV), faustoviruses share less than a quarter of their genes with other NCLDVs; however, ~46% are homologous to bacterial genes and the remainder are orphan genes (ORFans). Specifically, the gene encoding the major capsid protein (MCP) of faustovirus is different than that of its most closely related giant virus, asfivirus, as well as other NCLDVs. In asfivirus, the gene encoding MCP is a single genomic fragment of ~2000 base pairs (bp), however, in faustovirus the MCP is encoded by 13 exons separated by 12 large introns. The exons have a mean length of 149 bp and the introns have a mean length of 1,273 bp. The presence of introns in faustovirus genes is highly unusual for viruses . Replication The replication strategy of faustovirus in amoeba is similar to that of mimivirus. Lasting 18 to 20 hours, the replication cycle begins with the amoeba ingesting individual viral particles through a process known as phagocytosis. After about 2 to 4 hours post infection, virus particles are internalized via phagocytic vacuoles and are detected by the host. While the particles appear near the host‚Äôs nucleus, there is no evidence that the virus is within the nucleus or has an interaction with the nuclear membrane. Similar to the mimivirus, in which a channel is created for particle proteins and DNA to travel through, the faustovirus particles empty their internal compartments into the amoeba‚Äôs cytoplasm. In both viruses, the fusion leads to an eclipse phase in which the contents of particles become invisible inside the cytoplasm of the host. However, the eclipse phase of the faustovirus is longer than the mimivirus, taking place from 4 to 6 hours post infection. Characterized by a loss of its spherical shape and a decrease in surface area, the amoeba host cell undergoes reorganization, such that at 8 to 10 hours post infection there are new particles in a region forming a donut shape. This region is the viral factory; it is distinct from the nucleus and is surrounded by mitochondria. Between 12- and 18-hours post infection, the virus factory takes up the entirety of the cytoplasm, which is completely filled with new viral particles. At 18- to 20-hours post infection, the viral particles are released through cell lysis . Pathogenicity Faustovirus affects amoeba associated with the human environment, like Vermamoeba vermiformis; this particular amoeba has been found in hospital water networks, drinking water, human stool samples, and contact lenses of keratitis patients, thus it may be a possible carrying agent for viruses. Faustoviruses have been found in sewage water from various geographical locations, such as Senegal, France, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. Isolated strains of the virus have been detected in rodents, cattle, febrile and healthy humans, and well water and rivers. Although faustovirus was found in humans, it is unknown whether it has a pathogenic effect on humans; more research is required to determine the mode of infection and consequences of infection, if any exist.

It was translated to English by Jing Han in 2016. Ye also wrote the teleplay of a highly successful TV adaptation Sinful Debt (1995), which shattered ratings record in Shanghai. Translations *English: *Vietnamese: In 1998, Ian Chapman also translated an excerpt (Chapter 2, Part 4) to English on the magazine Renditions, under the title The Wages of Sin. Historical background and Ye Xin's novel Ye Xin was just one of tens of millions of Chinese urban teens \\"sent down\\" to the countryside in the 1960s and 1970s as part of the Down to the Countryside Movement. Although many set out the journey with revolutionary fervor, their naive idealism were crushed by realities of the hardscrabble rural lives too different from what they were used to. With no prospect of a better future in sight, many of these urban youths got married, had children and settled down in villages. Everything changed in 1976 with the death of Mao Zedong and the arrest of the Gang of Four. Soon after, these rusticated \\"youths\\" (now in their 30s) were allowed to return to cities, to reunite with their parents and try to be something other than peasants‚Äîonly if they were single. In many cases, those that were married had to divorce their spouses and abandon their children for a chance to return to their native cities. Sinful Debt was first serialized between 1991 and 1992 in the literary magazine Fiction World (Â∞èËØ¥Áïå). It was first published in book form in 1992 by Jiangsu Literature and Art Publishing House (Ê±üËãèÊñáËâ∫Âá∫ÁâàÁ§æ). After the broadcast of the TV series, the novel was reprinted several times in 1995 and broke several book sales record. The novel is based on true stories of abandoned children going to cities searching for their birth parents, and Ye Xin created believable situations that most highlighted the melodrama and tragedy associated with such reunions. The narrative not only contrasted the 2 generations, but also illustrated the differences between Shanghai and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture ‚Äî one densely populated, industrialized coastal metropolis, and one heavily forested rural town on the border with Myanmar, settled mostly by non-Chinese people. As Michael Berry pointed out, the tragedy \\"represents not only the delayed consequences of the past but also a repetition of the past\\". Just like their parents more than 20 years ago, the teens began the long journey with optimistic yearnings, only to \\"discover heartbreak, disillusionment, and tragedy\\".

The Astronomica was written c. AD 3040 by a Roman poet whose name was likely Marcus Manilius; little is known of Manilius, and although there is evidence that the Astronomica was probably read by many other Roman writers, no surviving works explicitly quote him. The earliest work on astrology that is extensive, comprehensible, and mostly intact, the Astronomica describes celestial phenomena, and, in particular, the zodiac and astrology. The poemwhich seems to have been inspired by Lucretius's Epicurean poem De rerum naturaespouses a Stoic, deterministic understanding of a universe overseen by a god and governed by reason. The fifth book contains a lacuna, which has led to debate about the original size of the poem; some scholars have argued that whole books have been lost over the years, whereas others believe only a small section of the work is missing. The poem was rediscovered 14161417 by the Italian humanist and scholar Poggio Bracciolini, who had a copy made from which the modern text derives. Upon its rediscovery, the Astronomica was read, commented upon, and edited by a number of scholars. Nevertheless, it failed to become as popular as other classical Latin poems and was neglected for centuries. This started to change during the early 20th century when, between 1903 and 1930, the classicist A. E. Housman published a critically acclaimed edition of the poem in five books. Housman's work was followed by the Latinist G. P. Goold's lauded English translation in 1977. Today, scholars consider it to be highly technical, complicated, and occasionally contradictory. At the same time, many have praised Manilius's ability to translate highly technical astronomical concepts and complex mathematical computations into poetry. Authorship and date Because no contemporary Roman sources mention his name, the exact identity of the Astronomicas author is a tantalizing question, but his name was probably Marcus Manilius.Volk (2009), p. 1. This uncertainty has led to Marcus Manilius being confused over the years with Manilius Antiochus (fl.c.100BC, mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia); Flavius Manlius Theodorus (fl.c.AD376409, a consul in AD399) and Bo√´thius (the sixth-century Roman senator and author of De consolatione philosophiae, whose full name was Anicius Manlius Severinus Bo√´thius).Volk (2009), pp. 2, 4. Although the poem suggests that the writer was a citizen and resident of Rome, some have contended that Manilius was a non-Roman; according to Katharina Volk, a Latinist who specializes in Manilius, this belief is generally based on either \\"the poet's supposedly inferior Latinity\\" or \\"the wish to see Manilius as the member of a Greek intellectual milieu at Rome\\".Volk (2009), p. 162. The 19th-century classicist Fridericus Jacobs and the 19th- and 20th-century historian Paul Monceaux have argued that he was an African, based largely on his writing style, which they say resembles that of African authors.Chisholm (1911), pp. 58081.Brock (1911), p. 180. Volk counters this view, arguing that Manilius writes \\"from ... a conventional Roman perspective\\" and \\"takes recourse to Roman history to illustrate the astrological facts he discusses\\".Volk (2009), pp. 16263. The work's date has been debated. The only historical event to which there is a clear reference is the Battle of the Teutoburg Foresta decisive loss for Rome, forcing her to withdraw from Magna Germaniain AD9.Volk (2009), p. 138. In considering the poem's date, scholars have proposed three hypotheses: that it was written entirely under Augustus (who ruled from 27 BC until AD 14), under the reigns of both Augustus and Tiberius (who ruled from AD 1437), or entirely under Tiberius. The first conjecture was favored primarily from the Renaissance until the 19th century, when Karl Lachmann argued that references to the emperor in the poem made more sense if they were referring to Tiberius. At the turn of the 20th century, scholars such as A. E. Housman began favoring the idea that the first two books were written under Augustus, the last two under Tiberius, and that the third was \\"undatable\\".Volk (2009), pp. 13839. This debate has not been settled,Volk (2009), p. 139. although Volk has argued that the poem should be dated to c. AD 1020. Contents The universe, as described by Manilius, is made up of two spheres: one solid (Earth) and the other hollow (the firmament), resembling this 17th-century depiction in Andreas Cellarius's Harmonia Macrocosmica. According to Volk, Manilius's Astronomica is the earliest work on astrology that is extensive, comprehensible, and mostly extant. Volk wrote that since he dedicates the poem to stellar phenomena, it is \\"indicative of the great fascination ... that the stars held for the Romans of Manilius' period\\".Volk (2011), p. 6. =Summary= The Astronomica, which is written in hexameters, opens with Manilius contending that he is the \\"first to sing of astrology\\". He also claims that the god Mercury engendered his interest in celestial bodies.Goold (1997) [1977], p. xvii. In the first book he ponders the origin of the universe, considering theories by Xenophanes, Hesiod, Leucippus, Heraclitus, Thales, and Empedocles before arguing that the universe was created from the four elements and is governed by a divine spirit.Manilius, Astronomica, 1.118254.Goold (1997) [1977], pp. xviii, xx. According to Manilius, the universe is composed of two spheres: one‚Äîthe Earth‚Äîis solid and the other‚Äîthe \\"sphere of stars\\", often called the firmament‚Äî is hollow. The constellations are fixed in the firmament; the Earth is stationary and the firmament revolves around it, explaining the movements of the stars. The planets, the Moon, and the Sun also revolve around the Earth in the vast space between its surface and the edge of the firmament.Volk (2009), p. 25. Because the Earth is in the center of the universe, it is equidistant from the firmament and is thus not compelled to \\"fall\\" in any specific direction.Volk (2009), p. 31. According to Manilius, the universe is ruled by a god (conspirat deus) and is governed by reason (ratione gubernat).Manilius, Astronomica, 1.251. Manilius next discusses the constellations and starsManilius, Astronomica, 1.255560. and the celestial circles.Manilius, Astronomica, 1.561804. In this section, the poet spends considerable time contemplating the Milky Way band,Manilius, Astronomica, 1.684804. which, after exploring several hypotheses as to its existence, he concludes is likely the celestial abode for dead heroes.Volk (2009), p. 266.Manilius & Goold (1997) [1977], p. 3. The first book ends with an exploration of comets, which Manilius sees as harbingers of calamity or great disaster.Heilen (2011), p. 282.Volk (2009), pp. 26667. signs of the zodiac, which are depicted in this 16th-century manuscript. Books two and three deal mainly with the finer details of the zodiac.Volk (2014), p. 95. Book two opens with a preface in which Manilius presents a brief history of hexameter poetry, singling out Homer and Hesiod. The purpose, Volk argues, is to emphasize the uniqueness of his poem in comparison to others rather than to insert himself into this poetic tradition. According to Manilius, \\"Every path that leads to Helicon has been trodden\\" (omnis ad accessus Heliconos semita trita est; all other topics have been covered) and he must find \\"untouched meadows and water\\" (integra ... prata ... undamque) for his poetry: astrology.Manilius, Astronomica, 2.50, 2.5354.Volk (2010), pp. 18788. Manilius ends the book's preface by saying \\"that the divine cosmos is voluntarily revealing itself both to mankind as a whole and to the poet in particular\\", and that he is set apart from the crowd because his poetic mission has been sanctioned by fate.Volk (2003), p. 628.Manilius, Astronomica, 2.60149. The poet then begins his explanation of the first astrologically significant circle: the zodiac itself. He first considers the signs of the zodiac (viz. Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces),Manilius, Astronomica, 2.150269. before discussing the aspects and relationships between the signs and other objects.Manilius, Astronomica, 2.270692. In this section, the poet briefly discusses the zodiac signs, the Olympian gods who serve as their protectors, and the relationship between the signs and the parts of the human body.Manilius, Astronomica, 2.43365. The Astronomica then considers dodecatemoriaManilius, Astronomica, 2.693749.Goold (1997) [1977], pp. xxxviiiliv. before he deviates from the zodiac and begins to discuss the didactic method.Manilius, Astronomica, 2.75087. The book concludes with a consideration of the second astrologically significant circle, that of the fixed circle of the observer.Volk (2009), pp. 26768.Manilius, Astronomica, 2.788970. The last few lines are dedicated to an overview of the dodecatropos.Manilius, Astronomica, 2.856970. The third book‚Äîwhich focuses mainly on \\"determin[ing] the degree of the ecliptic which is rising about the horizon at the moment\\" of a person's birth‚Äîopens with Manilius's reiteration that his work is original.Goold (1997) [1977], p. lxii. Because his topic is complex and difficult, the poet tells his audience they can \\"expect truth but not beauty\\". He then discusses the third astrologically significant circle, the lots,Manilius, Astronomica, 3.43202. which are points on a birth chart that carry special significance. Subsequent verses explain how to calculate the ascendant, the horoscope,Manilius, Astronomica, 3.203509. and chronocrators;Manilius, Astronomica, 3.51059. and how to determine the projected length of one's life.Manilius, Astronomica, 3.560617. The third book concludes with a discussion about the tropic signs,Volk (2009), p. 268.Manilius, Astronomica, 3.61882. which, while not particularly pertinent to the astrological content of the book, allows Manilius to end the book on a \\"poetic note\\". Most scholars consider the third book to be highly technical; according to Goold it \\"is the least poetical of the five, exemplifying for the most part Manilius's skill in rendering numbers and arithmetical calculations in hexameters\\".Manilius & Goold (1997) [1977], p. 161. A similar but less favorable sentiment is expressed by Green, who writes that in this book, \\"the disjuncture between instruction and medium is most obviously felt [because] complex mathematical calculations are confined to hexameter and obscured behind poetic periphrasis\\".Green (2014), p. 57. Andromeda (left), Perseus (upper right), and a sea monster (lower right). Books four and five are largely about \\"the effects of particular celestial phenomena on the native\\". Book four covers many topics that originated in Egypt, leading Goold to write that Manilius based his work on an Egyptian source.Goold (1997) [1977], p. lxxxiv. Much of the first portion of this book deals with decansManilius, Astronomica, 4.294386. and the partes damnandae,Manilius, Astronomica, 4.308501. both of which allow Manilius another chance to convert mathematical and astrological tables into poetic verse.Manilius & Goold (1997) [1977], p. 221. A short description of the rising of individual zodiacal degrees is followed by a more comprehensive survey of zodiacal geography.Manilius, Astronomica, 4.502817. Near the end of the book, Manilius writes about the ecliptic signs.Manilius, Astronomica, 4.81865. The book is punctuated at lines 4.387407 and 4.866935 by \\"exhortation[s] of the frustrated student\\", where complaints that astrology is difficult and nature is hidden are countered by statements that \\"the object of study is nothing less than (union with) god\\" and \\"the universe (microcosm) wishes to reveal itself to man\\".Volk (2009), p. 269. Most of the fifth (and final) book is a discussion of paranatellonta via the myth of Andromeda and Perseus.Manilius, Astronomica, 5.538618. Manilius recalls how Andromeda was chosen to be sacrificed to a sea monster by her parents; Cepheus and Cassiopeia. Andromeda was chained to a cliff but before the creature could consume her, Perseus (who had just vanquished Medusa) arrived. He instantly fell in love with Andromeda, killed the sea monster, and saved the young woman's life. According to Green, the digression, which is by far the longest in the poem, \\"is very well chosen, in as much as no other mythological episode involves so many future constellations interacting at the same time; Andromeda (e.g.5.544), Perseus (e.g.5.67), the Sea Monster‚Äîstrictly, Cetus (cf.5.600), but often referred to in more generic terms during this story as belua (5.544, 608) and monstrum (5.581)Medusa's head (e.g.5.567), and Andromeda's parents, Cepheus and Cassiopeia\\". Green says the story is perfect for Manilius; he is able to use it to justify the constellations' proximity to one another and their eternal arrangement, as he had previously argued in 1.354360.Green (2014), p. 46. Conversely, Housman compared it unfavorably to Ovid's version of the story and called Manilius's retelling \\"a sewn-on patch of far from the best purple\\" (purpurae non sane splendidissimae adsutus pannus).Manilius & Housman (1930), p. 70. A similar sentiment was expressed by the Cambridge classicist Arthur Woollgar Verrall, who wrote that while the episode was meant to be a \\"show piece\\", it comes across as \\"a poor mixture of childish rhetoric and utter commonplace\\".Verrall (1913), p. 630. Between lines 5.709‚Äì10, there is a large lacuna, meaning that at least some of the work is missing, and then the last few lines of the book concern stars and other stellar phenomena. The book ends with a simile about the \\"res publica of stars\\".Volk (2009), pp. 10910.Volk (2009), p. 270. This section‚Äîin which Manilius proposes that the stars constitute an elaborate and organized system, defined by a hierarchy that prevents \\"cosmic disaster\\"‚Äîseems to be a way for Manilius to assert the legitimacy of the Roman state through analogy.Volk (2009), p. 110. =Worldview= According to Volk, \\"The basic tenet of what we might call Manilius' natural philosophy is the idea that the universe is divine\\". She writes that Manilius is inconsistent about the location of this divinity. For instance, in his first book, Manilius claims the perfectly regular movement of the sun, moon, planets, and stars is proof that the universe is the product of a god; he also says the universe itself is a god (mundum ... ipsum esse deum).Volk (2009), p. 217.Manilius, Astronomica, 1.48485. Later in the same book, Manilius again says the universe is the \\"work of a great divinity\\" (magni ... numinis ordo).Manilius, Astronomica, 1.531. Concerning this vacillation, Volk writes; \\"It is clear that there is a certain elasticity to Manilius' concept of the divinity of the universe ... Is the world simply ruled by a diuinum numen (cf. 1.484) or is it a deus (cf 1.485) itself?\\"Volk (2009), p. 218. Volk answers that in the cosmology of the Astronomica, \\"God can be understood as the soul or breath ... present within the world [and] since this divine entity completely pervades the cosmos, it makes equally much sense to call the cosmos itself a god\\".Volk (2009), p. 219. According to Volk, this interpretation of the universe, which states that it has a sense of intellect and that it operates in an orderly way, thus allows Manilius to contend both that there is an unbroken chain of cause and effect affecting everything within the cosmos and that fate rules all.Volk (2009), p. 220. Volk points out the poem borrows or alludes to a number of philosophical traditions, including Hermeticism, Platonism, and PythagoreanismVolk (2009), pp. 23451. but the prevailing belief of commentators is that Manilius espouses a Stoic worldview in the Astronomica.Volk (2009), p. 226. A comparison between Manilius's beliefs and those of other Stoics reveals parallels that according to Volk \\"are immediately obvious\\".Volk (2009), p. 227. For instance, Stoics and Manilius agree on the divinity of the universe, the argument from design, the assumption that the supreme god is both the creator of the universe and the active force within it, the interconnectedness of everything, the understanding that humans are intimately connected to the cosmos, the importance of considering the heavens, and the belief in an inescapable fate that rules over all.Volk (2009), p. 22730. The agreement on this latter point is of special importance because, according to Volk, belief in fate is \\"one of the most notorious aspects of the Stoic system\\".Volk (2009), p. 228. The identification of the poem as Stoic, however, is not unanimous.MacGregor (2005), p. 41.Volk (2009), p. 226, note 13. In 1887, against the common opinion of contemporaneous scholars, Gustave Lanson contested the idea that the poem is Stoic. In 2005, Alexander MacGregor said that while contemporary scholars such as Goold and Volk read Manilius as a Stoic, the Astronomica actually breaks with or contradicts Stoic tradition in a number of places.MacGregor (2005), p. 65. Manilius exalts Plato, Socrates, and Pythagoras;MacGregor (2005), pp. 4749.MacGregor (2005), p. 51. proposes a Platonic proof for the existence of God,MacGregor 2005, p. 52. denies the ekpyrosis (a key Stoic belief in the periodic destruction of the cosmos by an immense conflagration every Great Year followed by a cosmic recreation),MacGregor (2005), p. 53. never discusses the six Stoic paradoxes as discussed by Cicero,MacGregor (2005), p. 54. and ignores the importance of controlling the soul. Manilius also focuses on a number of Pythagorean tenets; the Pythagorean order of the planets,MacGregor (2005), p. 56. the importance of geometry and numbers,MacGregor (2005), p. 5759. and the significance of tetraktys (triangular figures made up of ten points arranged in four rows).MacGregor (2005), p. 5965. In key places, Manilius also makes use of non-Stoics like Eudoxus of Cnidus and Cicero.MacGregor (2005), p. 57. Given these factors, MacGregor concludes that Manilius should be classified as an idealistic Pythagorean or a Platonist rather than a Stoic. =Style= Many consider the Astronomica to be a work of erudition, elegance, and passion. Scaliger and Bentley praised Manilius's handling of numbers in verse,Manilius & Housman (1920), p. 51. and the Harvard University Press later echoed this commendation, writing that Manilius \\"exhibit[s] great virtuosity in rendering mathematical tables and diagrams in verse form\\", and that the poet \\"writes with some passion about his Stoic beliefs and shows much wit and humour in his character sketches of persons born under particular stars\\". Housman, however, calls Manilius \\"facile and frivolous\\" but also describes him as \\"the one Latin poet who excelled even Ovid in verbal point and smartness\\".Housman (1916), p. xix.Housman (1903), p. xxi. The poem, while metrically correct, has been noted for its technical language and unusual word choices.Hatch (2007), p. 735. The classicist Arthur Woollgar Verrall argues that while \\"at his best, Manilius may remind us of Lucretius\\", the \\"metre [that he uses] has the regular and monotonous flow of the age\\". Jacobs, Monceaux, and others have attributed the Astronomica idiosyncrasies to Manilius's reported African origin; they argue he wrote and spoke a form of Africitas‚Äîa putative African dialect of Latin \\"with strongly marked peculiarities of vocabulary, syntax, sentence-structure, and style\\"‚Äîthus explaining the poem's quirks.Wilfrid (1928), p. 73. Aside from the dubiously hypothesized presence of Africitas in the poem, however, M. Dorothy Brock argues there is very little evidence that Manilius was from Africa. In addition to its stylistic oddities, the Astronomica includes some internal inconsistencies. According to Green, the poem is \\"riddled with confusion and contradiction\\"; he cites its \\"presentation of incompatible systems of astrological calculation, information overload, deferral of meaning and contradictory instruction\\". At the same time, Green notes that similar issues exist in other first-to-third-century astrological works.Green (2014), p. 56. According to Caroline Stark, Manilius paradoxically claims astrological knowledge may be acquired by individuals and that it is only granted by divine favor.Stark (2011), p. 267. T. Barton says Manilius may have included these contradictions and complexities so he would be regarded as \\"a figure of unreachable knowledge for the novice student-reader\\". Green, while not ruling out this hypothesis, says Manilius was probably not motivated by a \\"desire to carve out for himself a position of power in the new imperial world of experts\\" as Barton says. Rather, Green says Manilius‚Äîdue to his \\"pride in poetic innovation\\" and his \\"deference ... to the Emperor\\"‚Äîsought to present \\"himself as a compliant imperial agent, intent on producing a creative poetic enterprise that plots its own way through the levels of acceptable stellar discourse in the early empire\\". David Pingree concludes that the poem's \\"principal purpose seems to have been to delight its audience with poetry and to arouse admiration for the poet by its cleverness\\".Pingree (1980), p. 263. =Completeness= It is unknown whether the Astronomica is a finished work; a large lacuna (i.e. a gap) between lines 5.709 and 5.710 presents a problem with this discussion. According to Housman, based strictly on the contents of the Astronomica, one cannot cast a full horoscope because necessary information‚Äîsuch as an in-depth survey of the planets and the effects constellations both inside and outside the zodiac produce upon their setting‚Äîis missing.Housman (1903), p. lxxii. According to Volk, the lack of a lengthy consideration of the planets is rather puzzling because Manilius claims several times that he will examine their zodiacal nature.Volk (2009), p. 5. Goold writes that \\"a didactic poem is seldom an exhaustive treatise\\" and argues that Manilius likely gave a \\"perfunctory account of the planets' natures in the great lacuna [and then] considered his obligations duly discharged\\".Goold (1997) [1977], p. xiv. Others have argued the work was originally longer and some hypothesize it comprised eight books. These writers base their assertion on a letter sent in AD 983 by Gerbertus Aureliacensis (later Pope SylvesterII) to the Archbishop of Rheims, in which the former reports he had recently located \\"eight volumes about astrology by Boethius\\" (viii volumina Boetii de astrologia) at the abbey at Bobbio. Boethius was often confused with Manilius because one of the former's names was \\"Manlius\\".Goold (1997) [1977], p. xi. Those who favor the idea the poem was once longer argue the manuscript at Bobbio was a misattributed eight-book version of the Astronomica. Goold repudiates this hypothesis, noting the catalogue at Bobbio lists the work Gerbertus was likely referring to as composed of \\"three books by Boethius about arithmetic, and the rest [i.e. five] about astronomy\\" (libros Boetii iii de aritmetica et alterum de astronomia). This, according to Goold, is evidence Gerbertus found one manuscript that contained both Boethius's De arithmetica and Manilius's Astronomica rather than an eight-book version of the latter.Goold (1997) [1977], p. cviii. Volk, when considering the problem of completeness, proposed several hypotheses: the work is mostly complete but internally inconsistent about which topics it will and will not consider; the lacuna in book five may have originally contained the missing information; the lacuna may be relatively small and the work is unfinished; or entire books may have originally existed but were lost over time through the \\"hazardous process of textual transmission\\". Influences Although it was inspired by the Epicurean poem De rerum natura by Lucretius (pictured), the Astronomica embraces Stoicism. Manilius frequently imitates Lucretius, who wrote the didactic poem De rerum natura. Some classicists have suggested that Manilius may have sought to emulate Lucretius by writing six books, but evidence for this hypothesis is scarce, and it remains mostly speculative.Volk (2009), p. 120, note 138. While Lucretius's work espouses Epicureanism (a philosophy that emphasizes materialism and skepticism of superstition and divine intervention), Manilius's work is largely Stoic, and promotes a Greco-Roman understanding of creationism as well as fatalistic determinism.Keith (2013), p. xix. Both Volk and the Lucretian scholar David Butterfield have argued that Manilius is in many ways, an \\"anti-Lucretius\\", with the former arguing that \\"his presentation in the Astronomica of an orderly cosmos ruled by fate is a direct attack on the random universe depicted by his predecessor\\".Volk (2009), p. 192.Butterfield (2013), p. 48, note 9. Manilius sometimes conveys his philosophical stance via grammatical voice: unlike Lucretius, who often uses a passive construction to convey his understanding of nature, Manilius uses active grammatical constructions to convey the intentionality he sees in creation (e.g. \\"God and reason, which rules all things, guide earthly animals by heavenly signs\\", deus et ratio quae cuncta gubernat ducit ab aeternis terrena animalia signis).Steele (1932), p. 326.Manilius, Astronomica, 2.10708. Furthermore, while Lucretius used De rerum natura to present a non-theistic account of creation, Manilius \\"was a creationist rather than a materialistic evolutionist\\", and he consequently refers to \\"one spirit\\" (unus spiritus, 2.64), a \\"divine power\\" (divina potentia, 3.90), a \\"creator\\" (auctor, 3.681), and a \\"god\\" (deus, 2.475) throughout his poem.Steele (1932), p. 325. The Astronomica is influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses, Virgil's Aeneid, Ennius's Annales, and the Greek didactic poet Aratus.Volk (2009), p. 184. Aratus's influence s especially noticeable, and it seems likely that Manilius based much of his first book on portions of Aratus's Phaenomena.Volk (2014), p. 106. Despite his debt to Aratus, Manilius diverges from his understanding of the cosmos; Aratus focuses on mythology and \\"graphic description\\", whereas Manilius emphasizes the scientific aspects of his work.Abry (2007), pp. 1, 89. It is uncertain if Manilius had direct knowledge of Aratus's poem or if he used a translation by Cicero, Ovid, or Germanicus.Abry (2007), p. 2, note 5.Volk (2009), p. 189, note 29. The latter position is favored by several 21st-century scholars, such as Dora Liuzzi and Emma Gee.Gee (2013), p. 117. In regards to the poet's relationship with Germanicus, Wolfgang H√ºbner writes: \\"The few echoes of Germanicus' translation of Aratus are insufficient for us to establish which of the two drew on the other, or whether the two were composed independently of each other.\\" The Astronomica directly references Homer (as the \\"greatest poet\\", maximus vates) as well as Hesiod (calling him \\"nearest to [Homer]\\", proximus illi),Manilius, Astronomica, 2.1, 2.11.Steele (1932), p. 320. and alludes to numerous other Greek poets and writers such as Apollonius Rhodius, Choerilus of Iasus, Choerilus of Samos, and Aeschylus.Goold (1997) [1977], pp. 366, 369, 434. The poem also contains a direct allusion to Ennius's Annales, which, according to Goold, is the Astronomicas \\"one solitary notice of Latin literature.\\" Textual history The Astronomica was rediscovered by Poggio Bracciolini c.141617. Although there are over thirty existing manuscript copies of the Astronomica, the text as it is known today is derived from three key manuscripts: Codex Gemblacensis (G), Codex Lipsiensis (L), and Codex Matritensis (M). These in turn belong to two separate manuscript families: \\"Œ±\\" (which includes G and L), and \\"Œ≤\\" (which includes M).Goold (1997) [1977], p. cvi. Of the two families, Robinson Ellis wrote: \\"[Œ±] represents a text more correct, but worse interpolated; [Œ≤], a text which is fuller of copyists' errors, but less interpolated.\\"Ellis (1904), p. 5. The first family, \\"Œ±\\", takes its name from a now-lost source and includes manuscripts G and L. G, dating from the late 10th to the 11th century, was found at the monastery of Gembloux in Brabant, in modern-day Belgium; L, from the library of Leipzig, was probably written around the mid-11th century and has many corrections made by a scribe. Housman argues that L is the superior of the two, as it was probably copied straight from Œ±, whereas G was probably derived from a copy of a copy.Housman (1930), pp. vvi. The second family, \\"Œ≤\\", takes its name from the now-lost archetype and includes manuscript M,Housman (1930), p. v. which itself is a direct descendant of the manuscript that Poggio Bracciolini rediscovered (i.e. the aforementioned manuscript Œ≤) near Constance during a break in the Council of Constance c.141617.Housman (1930), p. xi. M had been transcribed by a German amanuensis on Bracciolini's request, but due to the scribe's incompetence the resultant manuscript was riddled with mistakes, prompting Bracciolini to sarcastically remark that the new copy had to be \\"divined rather than read\\" (divinare oportet non legere).Housman (1903), pp. viiviii.Asso 2003. Although poorly written, M has been singled out as possibly the most important surviving manuscript, because it was a direct copy of the archetype (Œ≤), whereas G and L are derived from a less \\"faithful\\" copy (that is, Œ±) of the archetype. Following the invention of the printing press, the editio princeps of the Astronomica was published in Nuremberg around 1473 by the astronomer Regiomontanus from an error-riddled Italian copy.Volk (2009), p. 2.Housman (1903), p. xii.Ellis (1904), p. 2. The text was then critically edited by Joseph Justus Scaliger, whose first edition was published in Paris in 1579; a second and improved edition, collated at least partially from the Codex Gemblacensis, was published in Leiden in 15991600, and a third edition was published in 1655 after Scaliger's death by Johann Heinrich Boeckler.Housman (1903), p. xiii. An updated edition was published by Richard Bentley in 1739.Ellis (1904), p. 3. Then, in five volumes between 1903 and 1930, Housman published what is considered by many scholars the authoritative edition of the poem (with an additional editio minor in 1932).Garrod (1933), p. 26. According to Volk, \\"[Housman's] work is famoussome might say notoriousfor its bold handling of the text, its incisive commentary, and its merciless ... invective against other scholars.\\"Volk (2009), p. 3. In 1977, G. P. Goold published a Loeb English translation, collated both from manuscript M and from photographs of various manuscripts which had once belonged to Housman, and with substantial introductory notes and diagrams.Goold (1997) [1977], p. cx. This was the first translation of the poem into English prose (Book I had been translated into English verse by Edward Sherburne in 1674, and the entire poem by Thomas Creech in 1697).Bailey (1979), p. 158.Goold (1997) [1977], p. cxv. Goold's translation was called \\"masterly\\" by Volk and Steven Green, who agreed that it \\"marked a significant development in the accessibility of Manilius to a larger audience\\".Green & Volk (2011), p. viii. It was reprinted in 1992, and Goold issued a corrected edition in 1997 that took into account, among other things, W. S. Watt's article \\"Maniliana\\".Goold (1997) [1977], pp. ixx. Impact and scholarship Although Manilius hoped that the Astronomica would earn him literary immortality, it barely survived into the Middle Ages. For this reason, A. E. Housman (pictured) compared the poem to a shipwreck, citing it as an example of why \\"no man ever ought to trust the gods\\". While Manilius is not quoted by any extant Roman author, many scholars argue that he is alluded to by a number of authors, including: Ausonius, Claudian, Commodian, Dracontius, Juvenal, Lucan, Manetho, Martianus Capella, Nemesianus, Orientius, Pseudo-Empedocles, Seneca, Sidonius Apollinaris, Tertullian, Titus Calpurnius Siculus, and Venantius Fortunatus.Volk (2011), p. 9. With this said, H√ºbner cautions that such assumptions should be considered carefully (or downright rejected, in the cases of Manetho and Pseudo-Empedocles), as the similarities may be due to a lost ancient epic precursor that Manilius and the others were all alluding to or borrowing from.H√ºbner (2012). The work of Julius Firmicus Maternus (who wrote in the time of Constantine about astrology and other subjects) resembles Manilius's work in many ways; for instance, in his Matheseos libri octo (composed c.33437), Firmicus follows Manilius's method of instruction closely and analyzes the poet's astrological fundamentals.Volk (2009), p. 124. This suggests that Firmicus almost certainly used Manilius (or someone inspired by him) as a guide. But despite the similarity between Firmicus's work and Manilius's, Firmicus neither mentions Manilius by name nor lists him as among the few Romans (viz. Germanicus, Cicero, and Fronto) who wrote about astrology. Volk notes that the earliest references to Astronomicaaside from literary allusionsmay be found in two Roman funerary inscriptions, both of which bear the line, \\"We are born to die, and our end hangs from the beginning\\" (nascentes morimur finisque ab origine pendet) from the poem's fourth book.Volk (2009), p. 1, note 1.Manilius, Astronomica, 4.16. This theory is not without its detractors, and scholars such as A. Maranini and G√≥mez Pallar√®s have suggested that these two inscriptions are forgeries dating from the Renaissance.Volk (2009), p. 62, note 10. Few copies of the Astronomica survived into the medieval period, and consequently Manilius seems to have been little read during this period. However, there are a few exceptions to this dearth of attention. H√ºbner, for instance, writes that Manilius may have inspired some of the writings of Columbanus. Additionally, an AD 988 letter from Gerbertus Aureliacensis to the abbey at Bobbio in which a request is made for a work \\"by M.Manilius (or possibly Manlius) about astrology\\" (M.Manilius (v.l. Manlius) de astrologica) is evidence that a copy of the Astronomica was probably kept in the library at Bobbio.Volk (2009), pp. 12. Although it was largely ignored during antiquity and the Middle Ages, the poem generated scholarly interest upon its 15th-century rediscovery. The Italian humanist Lorenzo Bonincontri delivered lectures on the Astronomica to large audiences and compiled his lecture notes into the work's first commentary.Heilen (2011), p. 278. Bonincontri was apparently interested in Manilius's treatment of the nature of comets in the first book of the Astronomica, and, according to Stephan Heilen, portions of Bonincontri's De rebus naturalibus et divinis are based on Manilius's work.Heilen (2011), pp. 278310. Despite the attention it received after its rediscovery, the Astronomica has never been as widely studied as other classical Latin poems. Nonetheless, interest in the poem developed in the second half of the 20th century when scholars began to study Manilius's philosophical and scientific ideas.Volk (2011), p. 1. The first full-length English monograph on Manilius and the Astronomica was Volk's Manilius and His Intellectual Background, which was published in 2009.Volk (2009), p. vii. Two years later, Volk and Green edited Forgotten Stars: Rediscovering Manilius' Astronomica with essays from scholars worldwide. The book's purpose was to \\"encourage readers to discover Manilius\\" and expand scholarly interest in the Astronomica, since previous research of the work's poetic, scientific, and philosophical themes had been primarily limited to Germany, France, and Italy.Volk (2002), p. 197. And while Manilius and his poem have been analyzed by scholars, many lay readers find the Astronomica confusing and overly technical. According to Kristine Louise Haugen, \\"The ambiguous phrases and extravagant circumlocutions necessitated by Manilius's hexameter verse must often have made the Astronomica seem, as it does today, rather like a trigonometry textbook rendered as a Saturday The New York Times crossword.\\"Haugen (2011), p. 213. Scholars have noted the irony of Manilius's relative obscurity, because he wrote the Astronomica in the hope of attaining literary immortality. Housman voiced this sentiment in a dedicatory Latin poem written for the first volume of his edition that contrasted the movement of celestial objects with mortality and the fate of Manilius's work. He compared the Astronomica to a shipwreck (carmina ... naufraga), arguing that it was incomplete and imperfect, having barely survived textual transmission; Housman mused that because Manilius's ambitions of literary fame and immortality had been almost entirely dashed, his work should serve as an example of why \\"no man ever ought to trust the gods\\" (ne quis forte deis fidere vellet homo).

Amidon (July 12, 1904 ‚Äì November 28, 1976) was a Vermont state commissioner of taxes and Vermont State Treasurer. Early life George Hilton Amidon was born in Littleton, New Hampshire on July 12, 1904, the fourth of seven sons of Mary Walker and Freeman Amidon. The Amidon family resided in Barnet, Vermont, and George Amidon graduated from Wells River High School. In 1926 he graduated from Boston University‚Äôs College of Business Administration. Early career From 1929‚Äì1934, Amidon owned and operated a store in Barnet, Vermont with his brothers, Perley and Theodore. In the late 1930s, he moved to Montpelier, where he served as a field auditor, first in the office of the Auditor of Accounts of Vermont, Benjamin Gates, from 1938‚Äì1940, and after that for the National Life Insurance Company (later part of the National Life Group). He was appointed Deputy State Treasurer on April 6, 1943 by State Treasurer Levi R. Kelley.Tax Administrators News In February 1945, Governor Mortimer R. Proctor appointed him to serve as Vermont's Commissioner of Taxes and he was reappointed by Governor Ernest W. Gibson, Jr. in 1947 and 1949.Vermont Legislative Directory, 1947, p. 609 State treasurer In September 1949, incumbent treasurer Levi R. Kelley resigned to become treasurer and business manager for the University of Vermont, and Gibson appointed Amidon to complete Kelley's term.Amidon is Candidate Amidon was elected to a full term as a Republican in 1950, and he was reelected every two years until 1964, when he lost his race for reelection. During this time period, the state treasurer managed the state's investments personally and Amidon's work enabled Vermont to maintain its AAA bond rating. In 1964, Democrat Peter J. Hincks defeated Amidon for State Treasurer, winning as part of the Democratic wave brought in by the landslide victory of Lyndon B. Johnson. Hinck's victory marked the first time Republicans had lost control of the office. The Republican Party had won every statewide election in Vermont for more than 100 years after the party's founding in 1855. As part of a concerted effort to make the Democratic party more viable by running legitimate candidates for all statewide offices, Hincks had run unsuccessfully every two years from 1938 to 1946, and again in 1950 and 1962. After the election, he admitted that he was surprised to have won, and effusively praised Amidon's tenure. Amidon served as a consultant to Hincks for six months after the end of his term in order to help with the transition. Later career Amidon served as a trustee of Vermont Junior College (later the Vermont College of Fine Arts) beginning in 1955, and in 1956 he was elected to the board of directors of the Montpelier National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Montpelier's Bethany Congregational Church. He also served as treasurer of the Vermont Division of the American Cancer Society and of the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation. In addition he was a vice president and director of the Vermont Mutual Insurance Company, and a director of Vermont-New Hampshire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. After leaving office, Amidon served as senior vice president and trust officer of the Montpelier National Bank. In 1965, he was elected treasurer of the Vermont Republican State Committee. Despite an effort by the Republican party to persuade him to run, in 1966 he declined to be a candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Vermont. Death and burial Amidon died at the hospital in Berlin, Vermont on November 28, 1976 after suffering a heart attack at his home in Montpelier. He was buried at McIndoe Falls Cemetery in Barnet, Vermont. Family Amidon married Theresa Jean Liddle in Barnet in 1929. They were the parents of two children, Thomas and Janet.

The bombing was preceded by an attack, where 15 Yemeni troops were killed in attacks on army positions outside Mukalla. ISIL said, one of its militants blew up a vehicle, packed with explosives, in an army base in the Khalf district at the city's eastern outskirts. Background The U.S. military announced, a week before the attacks, it had deployed a small number of personnel to Yemen, to aid the fight against AQAP, its first troop presence in the country since the Houthi takeover. A year of al-Qaeda rule also ended a month before the attacks. ISIL rarely intervenes in the area, the bombings took place, as it is known to be a stronghold of its al-Qaeda rivals. One day before, troops guarding an army post, in the Khalf district of Mukalla, opened fire at a vehicle, after they suspected its driver of being a suicide bomber, a security official said, adding, that the vehicle sped away. A general boasted, that his forces had captured around 250 al-Qaeda members, since they retook Mukalla and nearby coastal towns, including its commander for the city of Shihr. Iran and Saudi Arabia have also gotten involved in the conflict. ISIL had claimed responsibility for several attacks on government and coalition targets in Aden in the recent months. Bombing The first bomber, Abu al-Bara al-Ansari, detonated an explosives belt, as he joined a line of men at a police recruiting centre. The bomb exploded as Hadhramaut's security chief, general Mubarak al-Oubthani, walked out of his office, killing six of his guards, but leaving him with only minor injuries. The attacks included a suicide bombing, that targeted the residence of the commander of Hadhramaut's second military region, general Faraj Salmeen, but he escaped unharmed. The suicide bomber killed at least 41 police recruits and 47 police in total. The bomber also injured over 60 people.

Early work  William Douglas Lee's first major industrial and manufacturing facility design was The Catalina Swimwear Building (now The Catalina) located at 443 South San Pedro Street in Los Angeles. The Catalina Swimwear Building was constructed in 1923, less than two years after Lee began his independent practice, and was the headquarters for Catalina Swimwear. The building is of reinforced concrete construction, with a traditional Neoclassic fa√ßade sheathed in brick. Its construction is documented by City of Los Angeles Building Permit #38140, issued for a six- story building with a concrete frame on the southwest corner of San Pedro and Winston Streets.  Partnership with Florence Casler  Textile Center Building, built 1926 Lee gained during the 1920s when his idea to transform the city's aesthetic with real estate developer Florence Casler took hold. Together Lee and Casler erected what she termed a \\"utopian commercial area\\" centered on Pico Boulevard and Maple Avenue. Between 1924 and 1929 they erected many major specialized industrial buildings including the Textile Center Building, the Allied Crafts Building, the Bendix Building, the Printing Center, the Graphic Arts Building, the Garment Capitol Building, the Elias- Katz Shoe Factory (now the Downtown Women's Center) the Furniture Exchange Building, and the Merchants Exchange Building. Lee shared Casler's love of modern design enhanced with revival accenting and molding in terra cotta and stone. Even after their partnership ended, Lee designed some of the most iconic buildings in Los Angeles, including the Chateau Marmont and the El Royale apartments.  Later work  William Douglas Lee and his son, Douglas Everett Lee, were responsible for the design and construction of Lee Tower located at 5455 Wilshire Boulevard, in the Miracle Mile neighborhood. \\"It was among the first skyscrapers built in Los Angeles after the height limit ordinance of was relaxed (by the Los Angeles City Council) in 1957...\\" Lee and his son far surpassed the limit by constructing up, with a total of 21 stories.

The group publicly announced their existence in March 2016. The NDA have attacked oil-producing facilities in the delta, causing the shutdown of oil terminals and a fall in Nigeria's oil production to its lowest level in twenty years. The attacks caused Nigeria to fall behind Angola as Africa's largest oil producer. The reduced oil output has hampered the Nigerian economy and destroyed its budget, since Nigeria depends on the oil industry for nearly all its government revenues. The NDA's declared aims are to create a sovereign state in the Niger Delta and have threatened to disrupt Nigeria's economy if their aims are not met. The NDA claims its members are \\"young, educated, well travelled...and educated in east Europe\\". The group have criticised the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, for having never visited the delta and his detention of the Biafran independence activist Nnamdi Kanu.  Organization  The leadership of the organization is not understood, as many local leaders have acted as the spokesperson to the government. This has made it difficult for the government to make meaningful contact with the group. Nigerian officials are also disorganized when speaking with the members, as many have found it their duty to make contact.

It is a rainforest shrub, endemic to New Caledonia, and is adapted to the nickel-rich ultramafic soils found there. Pycnandra acuminata is notable as one of the most prolific hyperaccumulators of trace metals known, actively absorbing nickel from the soil and concentrating it within the plant to a concentration of up to 25% nickel citrate as dry weight of the sap, which is blue in colour due to the nickel content.Plants of New Caledonia. Atlanta Botanical Garden The vernacular name in French is s√®ve bleue (blue sap).Site Endemia de Nouvelle Cal√©donie Pycnandra acuminata The reason for this adaptation is not well established, but heavy metals such as nickel in soil are usually toxic to plants and it is thought that by complexing them into less-toxic organic salts and concentrating them in certain tissues, the plant may protect other more sensitive tissue from excess levels of toxic metal ions, or deter herbivores due to the toxicity. Such plants are of considerable interest due to their potential use in phytoremediation of heavy metal contaminated former mine sites, or potentially even as a means of non-destructive phytomining of metal- rich soils allowing metals to be harvested in an environmentally sustainable manner.Rascio N, Navari-Izzo F.

Support for the Christian Democratic Party at the 2017 parliamentary election. The Norwegian Bible Belt (Norwegian: bibelbeltet) is a loosely defined southwestern coastal area of Norway, which is more religious than most of Norway. Typically, the definition covers Western Norway (Vestlandet) and Southern Norway (S√∏rlandet), which includes the counties of Rogaland (typically called the \\"buckle\\" of the Bible Belt), Hordaland, Sogn og Fjordane, M√∏re og Romsdal, Vest-Agder and Aust- Agder. However, the most urban areas, such as Stavanger (once known as the 'religious capital of Norway'), have become strongly secularised since the 1960s and are no longer considered part of the Bible Belt.  Characteristics  Socioeconomic gender equality in the Bible Belt is the lowest in all of Norway; the major cities of Bergen, Stavanger and Kristiansand, however, are amongst the most progressive municipalities in the country. In the 1926 referendum on the repeal of prohibition on alcohol, the Bible Belt cast a strong vote against repeal (73.1% in Rogaland, 77.2% in M√∏re og Romsdal), unlike the rest of Norway. The Bible Belt also has a strong pietist movement, that opposes the central authority of the State Church of Norway. Rogaland is home to many missionary associations and the strongest base of the two main Christian democratic parties, the Moderate Left and Christian People's Party (the latter originally being from Hordaland). In S√∏rlandet, Sunday church attendance is observed by 2 in 10 people, compared to slightly less than 1 in 10 in Norway on average. Aust-Agder, Vest-Agder and Rogaland have the highest percentage of married farmers, and the lowest percentage of cohabitants. Rogaland and Sogn og Fjordane have the lowest proportion of divorces and separations, and the latter country also has the highest rate of unmarried farmers. According to research institute Forskning.no this relationship pattern is typical of the Bible Belt.  Little Bible Belt  There is also a \\"Little Bible Belt\\" (lille bibelbeltet) in the southeast near the Swedish border, covering R√∏mskog, Marker and Aremark.

Early life Foley was born on the Lower East Side in Manhattan. His father, also named Samuel J. Foley, was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1891 to 1895 and the New York State Senate from 1896 to 1906. The younger Foley graduated from Manual Training High School in Brooklyn, and later graduated from Georgetown University Law School in 1914, where he was also quarterback of the football team and captain of the basketball team. He served in Europe during World War I and was discharged as a captain. Professional career In 1924, Foley was named an assistant district attorney in the Bronx by District Attorney Edward J. Glennon, and participated in the extradition of Bruno Hauptmann in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. When Charles B. McLaughlin, who succeeded Glennon, resigned as Bronx County District Attorney to become a New York State Supreme Court justice in March 1933, New York Governor Herbert H. Lehman appointed Foley as the replacement. In his first election to the district attorney office in November 1933, Foley ran on the Democratic and Recovery Party lines, although he had previously been a Democrat. He won the election easily, and was subsequently re-elected three more times. In 1945, he was president of the District Attorneys Association of New York State. In a deal that was made in 1948 to create a fourth judgeship position on the Bronx County bench the following year, Judge Samuel Joseph, a Republican who was up for re-election for his judge position, obtained the endorsement of both the Republican and Democratic parties in the Bronx, with the understanding that in the following year, the Democratic nominee would also get the Republican nomination. That nominee was Foley. He won the election handily, and took office on December 23, 1949. Death Foley died of an unspecified brief stomach ailment in Union Hospital in the Bronx on May 14, 1951, and was survived by his wife Grace n√©e McLaughlin; three children, Samuel J. Jr., Margaret Florence, and Michael; and a sister, Mrs. Margaret Hughes.

It is located in the centre of S√£o Lu√≠s, the state capital, and contains the state's Legislative Assembly and other public buildings. Background The conservation unit is in the Calhau bairro of S√£o Lu√≠s, the state capital. It is located in the S√≠tio Santa Eul√°lia and S√≠tio Rangedor sectors of land owned by the IPEM (Instituto de Previd√™ncia do Estado do Maranh√£o) in a prime location of the city. In 1991 the Henrique de La Roque Palace was built there, the Administrative Centre of the State of Maranh√£o. The S√≠tio Rangedor Ecological Station was established as a fully protected area by state decree 21797 of 2005, with an initial area of . History The Legislative Assembly of the state of Maranh√£o was built within the Ecological Station soon after it was established. An environmental assessment report published in June 2006 stated that the construction had minimal impact on the conservation unit since it was mostly built on deforested parts of the site. Decree 23.303 of 2007 reduced the area of the unit to . The government later built the Sebrae Multicenter and the Pedro Neiva de Santana Convention Center in the unit. In February 2013 senior state politicians planted 50 seedlings of native species in the ecological station to symbolize the start of a compensation and reforestation program in Maranh√£o Island. About of the unit would be taken up by the program. In October 2013 it was reported that the seat of the Maranh√£o Institute of Industrial Metrics and Quality was to be built in the unit. In December 2015 a major fire devastated the environmental unit. The fire department would not say what caused the fire. On 11 May 2016 the state legislative assembly approved law 321/2015 to change the unit's status and name. The Ecological Station would now be called the S√≠tio do Rangedor State Park. Formerly public visits were only allowed for educational purposes. Under the new classification, the unit aims to preserve the natural ecosystem of great ecological significance and scenic beauty, support scientific research and environmental education and interpretation, and to support recreation in contact with nature and ecological tourism. Babassu Palms and trail in Rangedor Park. In 2017, the construction of a new space in the park began, seeking to transform it into a space for leisure, sport, and environmental preservation. The project would use an area of 7% of the park, in the region that was degraded with burning, dumping of garbage and illegal hunting. The construction of leisure areas also received criticism from environmentalists, for the importance of the site for the replacement of aquifers and guaranteeing the supply of underground water reserves. The new park opened in September 2019, which now has eight squares with sports equipment and playgrounds. There is also a hiking trail and a 3.5 km bike path, as well as an Environmental Police and a food truck village, as well as parking with 500 spaces. Other existing squares are the ones of: of the Love, Murici, Ouri√ßos, Tiracamb√∫ and Paje√∫.

They attended all the yearly roundups and branding of cattle (rodeos), and horses (recogidas), where their decisions were final, with no appeal. The Juez del Campo was also a law enforcement officer in cases of theft of livestock, fraudulent brands or certificates of ownership. The laws concerning livestock were mostly traditional, handed down from decisions established during the Spanish Empire in the Americas and from Spain before that. The office was held for a year and was unpaid, taken up for the honor, usually by landowners with large holdings in the district. The office renamed Judge of the Plains, by the American settlers, was adopted in the Texas Republic and later in the territories acquired in 1848, by the United States during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War with large populations of former Mexican citizens.
